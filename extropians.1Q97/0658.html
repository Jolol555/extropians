Hal Finney expressed skepticism at my claims of having significantly increased <br>
my intelligence through the mental disciplines I've developed over the past <br>
few years.  And rightly so; how would he know how smart I was a few years ago <br>
or how smart I am now, having only read my posts to this list?  I certainly <br>
*believe* I have increased my intelligence significantly over the past few <br>
years, but maybe I've been smart my whole life but I just perceive myself as <br>
smarter now because I'm so fascinated with my own intelligence that I pay more <br>
attention to it and therefore it seems to have increased.  I mean, how could <br>
one really increase such a poorly understood and mysterious quality, such as <br>
*intelligence*, without doing some major changes to the brain structure?  How <br>
could something like *mental disciplines* have an effect on something as basic <br>
as intelligence?<br>
<p>
Can we really increase our intelligence by changing the way we think?  Can we <br>
train our minds to be more intelligent?  Or are we stuck at a certain level <br>
that we can never go beyond, except through sophisticated physical <br>
manipulation of our brains?<br>
<p>
What do we even *mean* by "intelligence"?  Is the ability to solve complex <br>
problems an aspect of intelligence?  What about the ability to see meaningful <br>
patterns in data?  What about the ability to learn new skills?  Or the ability <br>
to understand things clearly?  Or the ability to perform tasks accurately and <br>
efficiently in a complex environment?  Are these abilities all aspects of <br>
intelligence (but not necessarily the *only* aspects of intelligence)?<br>
<p>
If those abilities are aspects of intelligence, can someone who has these <br>
abilities improve them through practice and refinement?  Can one increase <br>
one's abilities through practice?  If I am able to solve complex problems, can <br>
I improve my abilities by solving lots of complex problems and continually <br>
increasing the complexity and difficulty of the problems I am solving?  If I <br>
am able to learn new things, can I improve my learning skills by practicing <br>
learning new things?  Or will I always be at the same level of ability no <br>
matter how much I practice?<br>
<p>
Our daily experience tells us that people *do* improve their abilities through <br>
practice.  Does a concert pianist have the same musical ability they had when <br>
they first began playing the piano?  Does a skilled computer programmer have <br>
the same programming ability as the first time they used a computer?  Does a <br>
skilled philosopher understand things in as much depth as when they first <br>
began their inquiry?<br>
<p>
I am profoundly fascinated with intelligence; especially my own.  I always <br>
have been.  I have always been highly intelligent (although, until recently, <br>
not very outgoing).  I have watched the development of my mind with <br>
fascination, and I have kept a fervent watch for ways to improve my <br>
intelligence.  My basic ambition is to become an incredibly brilliant genius.  <br>
I am driven quite strongly toward this goal, and I am always looking for ways <br>
to improve my intelligence and trying out lots of different approaches.<br>
<p>
The most reliable way I have found to increase my intelligence is to <br>
diligently practice the area of ability I wish to improve.  I wish to be an <br>
excellent problem solver, so I am always giving myself difficult problems to <br>
solve, and my abilities in this area have improved significantly, and I just <br>
keep increasing the difficulty of the problems I give myself, and I keep <br>
rising to the challenge and improving my problem solving skills.  I wish to <br>
have a clear and accurate understanding of as much as I can, so I practice <br>
thinking about things I don't understand as well as I want to, until I <br>
understand them more clearly and accurately, and the more I practice, the <br>
stronger my skills at understanding things grow.  I want to be a more accurate <br>
and intense observer, so I practice paying intense attention to as many <br>
details of my sensory experience as I can, and my environment has become <br>
dramatically richer and more detailed for me, and I am able to pay attention <br>
to a much greater number of things simultaneously than I ever have been.  <br>
<p>
There are many, many other abilities I am working on also, all with great <br>
success.  But all my success in improving my various abilities has come <br>
through dilligent practice.  I can understand why Hal would be skeptical, even <br>
at this point, that practice of abilities will actually raise one's <br>
*intelligence*.  I think that is because if one works on only a few abilities <br>
and improves them significantly, one's general intelligence isn't affected a <br>
great deal, except in those areas.  However, my approach is to practice <br>
*every* ability I am aware I have, and this approach *does* raise my general <br>
level of intelligence because I improve my skills in a tremendous number of <br>
areas.  <br>
<p>
I am always working on improving *something* in my mind.  There are so many <br>
things to work on, so many areas of intelligence to improve, that in any given <br>
moment, there is always something I am very interested in working on.  It's my <br>
extreme diligence and broad-based approach that have led to the dramatic <br>
increases in intelligence I am experiencing.<br>
<p>
Those reading this, such as Hal, will probably remain skeptical of my claims <br>
of dramatically increased intelligence, and they *should* be skeptical.  For <br>
all you know, I'm making this up.  But hopefully my claims seem more <br>
*reasonable*, especially since the phenomena of practicing an ability and <br>
consequently improving it is such a common experience.  My main hope, though, <br>
is that more people will work on improving their minds, that more people will <br>
develop and strengthen the mental disciplines required to increase one's <br>
intelligence.  Intelligence doesn't come easy; it takes a lot of hard work, <br>
and it must be constantly maintained so it doesn't deteriorate.  But, with a <br>
lot of practice and intense personal discipline, it is possible to improve <br>
one's intelligence quite dramatically.<br>
