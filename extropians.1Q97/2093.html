Kathryn,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am now wondering whether this technique similar to or different from</i><br>
<i>&gt; a technique used by persons in interdisciplinary fields who utilize</i><br>
<i>&gt; research from various systems of research.  It's difficult for me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; describe, but when one is drawing together research from various</i><br>
<i>&gt; fields, there is a sort of mental juggling act wherein one must</i><br>
<i>&gt; evaluate each piece of research within the context and the methodology</i><br>
<i>&gt; under which it was conducted, and simultaneously bring those pieces</i><br>
<i>&gt; together into a coherent connecting concept.  Maybe I am describing</i><br>
<i>&gt; parallel processing, because there is a sensation of shifting back</i><br>
<i>&gt; and forth between two tracks of thought, but conceptually I tend to</i><br>
<i>&gt; view it as a fractal construction.</i><br>
<p>
It seems like that whatever we call it, it appears more and more to be<br>
a fundamental skill of some kind.  Thanks for your contribution, as I <br>
feel that this is going to lead us to "pay-dirt" within the field of<br>
memetics.<br>
