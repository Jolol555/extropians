	From: "J. de Lyser" &lt;gd33463@glo.be&gt;<br>
	What about problems where no market solution fits ?<br>
<p>
What do you want, egg in your beer?  (as my neighbor used to say)<br>
<p>
Yes, you can contrive examples where markets perform less well than<br>
an omniscient and benevolent planner.  So?  That doesn't change the<br>
empirical fact that markets have done a better job than anything else<br>
so far *in the real world* (where nobody is omniscient).<br>
<p>
	And still if a majority views something as a problem, and a minority<br>
	views it as a good thing, the free market will rule against it ?<br>
	A characteristic we oppose in the current forms of democracy.<br>
<p>
Who's "we"?<br>
<p>
Majorities have done all sorts of evil to minorities.<br>
The will of the majority is not sacred.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that a vote is only valid if all the voters value the<br>
outcome equally strongly - in other words, assign equal weight to the<br>
vote.  That's very unlikely.<br>
<p>
	Except that in this case a minority with more money can decide<br>
	for a majority with fewer money...<br>
<p>
What do you mean "decide for"?<br>
My policy is never to spend money on zucchini, or tobacco, or books<br>
in Bengali, or movies with Sylvester Stallone.  If I were as rich<br>
as Bill Gates, could I impose such policies on you?  How?<br>
<p>
	[...] Its the school book example of how the ducth state is justified:<br>
	who else would build a dike to protect us from the sea ?<br>
<p>
Maritime landowners?<br>
<p>
	It might work in the Roman way of bread and circusses, as a gift<br>
	from some ultra rich individual or company to placate the angry<br>
	mobs. But its hyper irrational to depend on chance.<br>
<p>
When one rich man says no, maybe another will say yes.<br>
When the state says no, not only have you not got what you asked for,<br>
you haven't got your tax money either ;)<br>
<p>
	Think about it, what place do mentally disordered people have in an<br>
	anarcho capitalist society ? They can't provide for themselves, and<br>
	i don't believe in peoples altruism (at least not anymore).<br>
<p>
Do you believe in planners' altruism?<br>
<p>
	Most people value something higher than profit,<br>
	im truly sorry for you if you don't.<br>
<p>
I think your understanding of "profit" is too narrow.  (Not your fault,<br>
it's common.)  The balance of profit or loss includes intangibles such<br>
as enjoyment of the job.  For example, Years ago, as an unemployed<br>
engineer, I decided never to do military work.  It could have made me<br>
plenty of money, but at a cost of damage to my self-respect - to my soul -<br>
which, in my computation, outweighed the money, for a net loss.<br>
