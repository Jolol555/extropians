<i>&gt; I'm still unsure why Mr. Crocker believes these memes are dangerous or evil.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I see them as fairly useful pieces of advice when applied appropriately and </i><br>
<i>&gt; when one's goal is to develop many strong and beneficial relationships with </i><br>
<i>&gt; other people. I suppose that if one interpreted those statements to mean that </i><br>
<i>&gt; one should sacrafice one's own freedom to please other people, that would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; harmful, but if one realizes that being considerate of other people's desires </i><br>
<i>&gt; and prefrences will generally help one achieve one's goals more effectively </i><br>
<i>&gt; than antagonizing others will, then the statements are good advice.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  - David Musick</i><br>
<p>
If I have to spend time thinking about everything I say in terms of how<br>
the other person might react--based on my limited knowledge of him or<br>
her--before I speak, and if I react with annoyance at what is said to me,<br>
in what way is that relationship healthy, strong, or beneficial?  Because<br>
the sex is good?  Because we don't kill each other?  Couldn't I have a<br>
relationship with those attributes, and that also served the goal of<br>
expanding our minds with unrestrained expression and criticism?  Must I<br>
condemn myself to a life of restraint among fragile waifs, or might I<br>
empower everyone at the small price of ruffling a few feathers?<br>
