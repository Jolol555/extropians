         <br>
<i>        &gt;Omega:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;The definition of local in relativity theory IS and ONLY IS:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt; s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ict)^2, x, y, z, and t all being real.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;All pairs of spacetime points that don't obey this equation have         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;are non-local.</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
So, according to you, Einstein said that things are non-local if the distance <br>
between two points in space-time is not equal to the distance between two <br>
points in spacetime. Now I understand why you think Cramer's theory is local,  <br>
but I don't understand why you think Einstein was a genius. <br>
<p>
By the way, I've never heard of any concept in human knowledge that can be <br>
expressed in ONE and ONLY ONE way.           <br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A locally causal temporally bidirectional microcausality would allow         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;violation of Bell's inequality just fine.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I quote from "Schrodinger's Kittens" by John Gribbin Page 243:<br>
<p>
 "The tests of Bell's inequality explicitly shows that "microscopic" <br>
  causality is violated, regardless of what interpretation of Quantum  <br>
  Mechanics you favor."<br>
<p>
I certainly agree that Cramer's theory violates Bell's inequality, it is <br>
perfectly consistent with all known experimental evidence because it is <br>
non-local. In another post I gave you a precise definition of "local", <br>
if you broaden it to such a ridiculous extant that even a particle "shaking  <br>
hands with the universe" is local then the concept of locality forfeits all  <br>
meaning and forfeits all usefulness.           <br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Even if we someday find a better theory than Quantum Mechanics,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;any successful theory must explain that experimental result.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Omega:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Nothing needs to be explained.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nonsense. Science is about prediction, Bell proved that classical Physics,  <br>
or any other conceivable local theory, would predict a smaller correlation  <br>
between the properties of polarized photons or spinning electrons than  <br>
Quantum Mechanics does. Experimental results show that Quantum Mechanics <br>
makes a much better prediction. Any theory that claims to be better than<br>
Quantum Mechanics had damn well better make a prediction that is at least  <br>
as good.      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Again, it [Cramer's theory] only seems non-local when one assumes         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that micro-causality is unidirectional with respect to time.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If Cramer's theory only seems non-local then it is really local, if it is <br>
local then it has been proven wrong, Cramer's theory has not been proven <br>
wrong so Cramer's they can not be local.<br>
<p>
- From "Quantum Reality" by Nick Herbert, page 227:<br>
<p>
"Bell's Theorem is an important tool for reality research because it enables  <br>
 folks who create imaginary worlds confidently to reject millions of  <br>
 impossible worlds at a single glance. Bell's theory tells you right away:  <br>
 If it's local, it's hokum."<br>
<p>
- From "The Unconscious Quantum" by Victor J Stenger, page 111:<br>
<p>
"What Bell had succeeded in proving was that realistic, local hidden <br>
 variables cannot provide a deterministic mechanism for Quantum Mechanics, <br>
 if Quantum Mechanics is to apply to individual measurements."<br>
<p>
- From "The Cosmic Code" by Heinz R Pagels, page 165:<br>
<p>
"There were only two physical interpretations of Bell's experiment- either <br>
 the world was nonobjective and did not exist in a definite state, or it was <br>
 nonlocal with instantaneous action at a distance. Take your pick of <br>
 weirdness."<br>
<p>
I now quote from John Bell's original paper. After deriving his inequality he <br>
says that if it is experimentally proven to be false, as it was 20 years <br>
later, quantum mechanics or any successor theory must have certain qualities:<br>
<p>
"In a theory in which parameters are added to Quantum Mechanics to determine <br>
 the results of individual measurements without changing the statistical  <br>
 predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measuring <br>
 device can influence the reading of another instrument no matter how remote. <br>
 Moreover, the signal must propagate instantaneously."<br>
<p>
If somebody says Cramer's theory is local they are libeling it, they are <br>
saying it has been proven to be false, and that in untrue.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Not only is Von Neumann's mistake not moot, it is IMO the biggest        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;obstacle within existing theory blocking fundamental scientific         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;progress into the nature of reality.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Boy, you really have it in for Von Neumann. The poor man made a mistake, even <br>
the best of us do that from time to time. Everybody knows it was a mistake, <br>
I don't see how it's blocking anything.<br>

On a completely different subject, I just found out that in the USA on PBS  <br>
they will broadcast a play about the life of Alan Turing tonight (Sunday).<br>
