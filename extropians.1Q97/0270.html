WIth todays technology, political representatives are obsolete. This<br>
obsolescence actually was inherent in the existence of the TV and Phone,<br>
but social inertia and all...<br>
<p>
THere is no reason why we couldn't have nationwide votes on proposed<br>
legislation every evening. In such an event, I would suggest that<br>
political advertizing be banned to allow each person their own studied<br>
opinion free from outside influence, Freedom of speech or no.<br>
<p>
WHile initially this would cause all sorts of yoyo/seesaw behaviors as<br>
people actually got into the practice of passing their own stupid laws<br>
and having to live with the consequences, but I imagine that people<br>
would tire of that FAST and start to act a lot more responsibly with<br>
their reaquired powers.<br>
<p>
WIth this, we would need a system of populating the Supreme court with<br>
the most conservative cantankerous old bastards/bitches determined to<br>
protect our Constitutional rights from our own stupidity. THe more<br>
powerful we make the legislative branch responsive to popular whims, we<br>
need an equally powerful brake in the Judicial to prevent us from<br>
lemmingization.<br>
<p>
Funny thing is though, this would probably INCREASE the population of<br>
lawyers.......damn, I knew there had to be a downside.<br>
