It think you are going to have trouble finding a satisfactory term.<br>
Posthuman is commonly used, but as has been so recently illustrated,<br>
that can mean anything. Cyborg might have been good, but Star Trek, via<br>
the Borg, showed how that can be easily interpretted religously, bent to<br>
mean some sort of assimilation and displacement of identity with the<br>
"greater" whole.<br>
<p>
Even the "trans" in transhuman, refering to transcendental, is teaming<br>
with contradicting religous and political connotations. Extropian is a<br>
great term, but we can refer to ourselves as extropian today, its not a<br>
goal for the future. Extrodinaire (rather than extrAordinaire) might be<br>
a good adjective, e.g., posthuman extrodinaire, but is too wordy. Good<br>
luck.<br>
 <br>
On an aside, I thought of a derogatory term for perversions of extropian<br>
memes which do not clearly require dynamic optimism: extropiates. An<br>
example extropiate might be: "technology will make everything better",<br>
or "technology will improve existence". Unqualified memes like that can<br>
lead to passive waiting for technology to save us, when there are things<br>
we can do right now to improve the conditions of our existence, e.g.,<br>
educational reform, political reform, and anything else that might<br>
involve a more effective use of what we already have. Paraphrasing<br>
someone from an earlier post, if we cannot use what we have now<br>
effectively, whats to make us think we will use the technology of the<br>
future effectively.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
