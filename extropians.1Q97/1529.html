David Musick, &lt;David_Musick@msn.com&gt;, writes:<br>
<i>&gt; There are aspects of ourselves which change very quickly, such as the sounds </i><br>
<i>&gt; we hear or the sights we see; colors and tones rise and fall, shifting with </i><br>
<i>&gt; each moment; thoughts come and go, emotions surge and fade.  But there are </i><br>
<i>&gt; other aspects which change more slowly; our personalities develop into </i><br>
<i>&gt; somewhat stable habits of thought and action, changing, certainly, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; changing slowly.  The basic patterns of human thinking and culture have </i><br>
<i>&gt; persisted through many generations, our language and customs being passed from </i><br>
<i>&gt; parent to child, maintaining their *basic* forms, even as they mutate in </i><br>
<i>&gt; important ways.  Other aspects, such as the chemical processes of our cells; </i><br>
<i>&gt; the duplication of DNA, the formation of protiens, the constant metabolism; </i><br>
<i>&gt; these processes change *much* more slowly; the same basic *pattern* has </i><br>
<i>&gt; spanned millions of generations.  Even slower to change is the behavior of our </i><br>
<i>&gt; atoms;  they've been doing the same familiar dance for billions of years, </i><br>
<i>&gt; altering their pattern of action very little, if any, since they first formed </i><br>
<i>&gt; and settled into their habitual ways.  The Deep Regularities of Physics, so </i><br>
<i>&gt; deep and so regular that we call them Laws, seem to change the slowest of all, </i><br>
<i>&gt; if indeed *at* all, the slow background pattern underlying all the other, </i><br>
<i>&gt; dancing patterns we call our universe.</i><br>
<p>
This is a poetic picture but I think it brings in too many layers to be<br>
useful in thinking about what our identity is and what it means to die<br>
or stop.  Changes to atoms, changes to the way DNA duplicates itself,<br>
changes to the designed metabolism of cells, changes between generations,<br>
are not relevant to my identity.  It does not matter in any way whether<br>
an earlier generation (or another person today, for that matter) used<br>
the same rules as I do.  These changes are of another type than the<br>
changes which take place within my brain and body as I go through life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So perhaps it *does* make some sense to say that there is someone *having* </i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences, since our slower changing aspects,  like our personalities, </i><br>
<i>&gt; *persist* as the momentary sensations and thoughts flutter around them like </i><br>
<i>&gt; flies around elephants.  Is the personality the same pattern as the momentary </i><br>
<i>&gt; experiences?  Not really.  There is no clear *division* between them, but they </i><br>
<i>&gt; change at different rates; they live on different scales of time.  They </i><br>
<i>&gt; interact and shape each other to some degree, and they are part of the same </i><br>
<i>&gt; overall pattern of existence, but they each have their own distinct features.  </i><br>
I think it's interesting that you don't mention the one mental<br>
aspect that many people have focussed on as the be-all and end-all of<br>
identity: memory.  I have heard it said that as long as my memories<br>
of the present day are preserved, I can be said to retain my identity,<br>
even if my personality and my sensory organs change radically.  Memory is<br>
not exactly a process.  It is more like a database which the processes<br>
within our minds can access.  It doesn't really fit into this model<br>
of the brain being composed (solely?) of a range of fast-changing and<br>
slow-changing aspects.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But what about death?  What happens to us *then*?  Much of the complex pattern </i><br>
<i>&gt; that we are disappears, patterns which rose and fell, like our momentary </i><br>
<i>&gt; sensations and thoughts.  To the slower-changing patterns, such as the </i><br>
<i>&gt; personality, the rising and falling of sensations and thoughts is commonplace </i><br>
<i>&gt; and hardly disturbing.  To even slower-changing patterns, such as culture and </i><br>
<i>&gt; the basic metabolism of humanity, the rising and falling of personalities and </i><br>
<i>&gt; individual bodies is common-place and rarely disturbing.</i><br>
<p>
Culture and basic metabolism do not experience emotions!  They are not<br>
conscious actors.  Here is another way I think your model breaks down.<br>
You are trying to see a continuum of phenomena when in fact there is<br>
a sharp dividing line between human consciousness and these larger<br>
scale phenomena.  So of course the basic metabolism of humanity is not<br>
disturbed by the rising and falling of personalities.  It isn't disturbed<br>
by anything; it is not an agent to which the notion of "being disturbed"<br>
can apply.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Our personalities, of course, want to persist as long as possible.  They do </i><br>
<i>&gt; not want to die.  Of course, they will inevitably change over time, and given </i><br>
<i>&gt; enough time to change, they may become transformed into something quite </i><br>
<i>&gt; *different*.  This type of steady changing is not really all that troubling to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the personalities;</i><br>
<p>
(Actually a lot of people are very troubled by steady change if it goes on<br>
long enough.  Just yesterday we had a posting suggesting that sufficient<br>
change was tantamount to death.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are only patterns, shifting.  Some change faster than others, dancing </i><br>
<i>&gt; upon the underlying slowness.  The patterns relate to each other, forming new </i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns, often growing in complexity, often shifting suddenly into other </i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns.  We, ourselves, are shifting patterns, a part of the whole, </i><br>
<i>&gt; elaborate, interconnected pattern.  Certain aspects of ourselves are transient </i><br>
<i>&gt; and ephemeral, while the deeper aspects are more lasting.  The constant flow </i><br>
<i>&gt; of patterns; existence</i><br>
<p>
Again, this is poetic and valid in a vague way, but I don't think it is<br>
that useful.  There may be patterns at many levels, but I can still draw<br>
a line which separates the patterns that make up my identity from those<br>
which represent culture and metabolism.  Likewise even within my own<br>
mind I don't think there is necessarily a continuum of changing patterns.<br>
It could be that there are several distinctly different rates of change<br>
for each of the different functional components of the mind.  Each one<br>
would be tuned by evolution to that rate which is most appropriate to<br>
that kind of functionality.  My introspective skills are not perceptive<br>
enough to be sure, though!<br>
