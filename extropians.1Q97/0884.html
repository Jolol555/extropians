:-) Well, that depends a bit on perspective. In the happy 60's, everyone<br>
thought that general planning was just a problem of graph-traversing and<br>
computer vision was a graduate student problem. We know somewhat better<br>
now... <br>
<p>
In some sense both problems can be seen as equivalent; I'm buying more<br>
and more into Furschters model of the brain divided into an<br>
input/perception part and a planning/motor part. <br>

<p>
Hmm, I'm not so convinced about this. Remember Piaget's various stages,<br>
where the child seems to lack certain abilities before certain ages, and<br>
gradually develop concepts such as object constancy (things exist when I'm<br>
not looking at them) or conservation (if I move things around but do not<br>
take anything away, then there is the same amount of stuff). Most likely<br>
these have to be reinforced by experience, and may be completely due to<br>
the environment (at least the later). The way to test it is of course to<br>
bring up a child in a virtual reality with different laws... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Though I could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong; visual visualization might derive its rules from the environment,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the genes just setting up the visual cortex to learn from it.</i><br>
<p>
A classic example is the formation of ocular dominance stripes in cat<br>
visual cortex. In normal cats, the axons from the lateral and<br>
contra-lateral LGN at first branch out homogenously over the cortex, and<br>
then after the kitten has opened its eyes, tend to die off clumpwise<br>
(probably due to darwinnowing of some kind) in a way that leads to the<br>
zebra-stripe-like dominance bands. But if the poor kitten doesn't get <br>
visual information this doesn't happen, and the bands never form =&gt; <br>
incomplete vision.<br>
<p>
There seem to be quite a few parts of the brain that has to be trained <br>
over time to develop well; the basic circuitry exists, but then parts of <br>
it have to be removed or adjusted in complex ways. <br>
