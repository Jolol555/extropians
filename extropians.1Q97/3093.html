I still don't understand this thing about 'child labor'. Sure, I don't<br>
really want to see eight-year-old kids working in factories or mines, but<br>
when I was fourteen I spent a lot of my free time writing software. Why<br>
should I have to do it for free when I could have been earning money at<br>
it and gaining some useful resume points? <br>
<p>
Incidentally, I saw an interesting TV show a couple of months ago which<br>
was looking at the first anti-child-labor laws in the UK. They made a<br>
reasonable case that much of the evidence given to the government was<br>
staged, and that the kids much preferred working in factories to working<br>
on farms. <br>
