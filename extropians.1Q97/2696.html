Anders replies to the Willow:<br>
<i> &gt;&gt; Indefinite lifespans are boring?</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Hardly. But the universe becomes a very boring low-density lepton gas; </i><br>
<i> &gt;Tipler promises excitement... ;-)</i><br>
<p>
I don't see anything more exciting about the Tipler scenario than<br>
about the Dyson scenario. Boredom and excitement are not a function<br>
of ones environment but a function of how well or poorly adapted<br>
one is to the most recent changes in ones environment. Maladaptation<br>
is easy to produce, because new challenges are fairly easy to find,<br>
particularly when ones goals are centered around self-creation<br>
and self-improvement.<br>
<p>
A side note on Reilly and Gregory's debate on truth. Truth is a<br>
guiding ideal that has evolved over time. I don't think that it is<br>
a condition that we can use descriptively of anything; rather, I<br>
think it is a condition that we aspire to, and that aspiring to<br>
this condition has been quite helpful to us in our projects so far.<br>
To have the truth: that is something to strive for, not something<br>
to claim that one has achieved.  Richard Rorty recommends that we<br>
bag the notion of truth for disposal because we do not understand<br>
it and because the notion has been used in a destructive way in<br>
some debates, but I still think Rorty is foolhardy in his exhortation.<br>
Let's not rip up and shred *all* of the traditions that have gotten<br>
us this far, at least not until we're sure we understand how they<br>
are helpful to us as well as how they are harmful to us. I tend to<br>
be quite sceptical of claims to understanding of that sort, because<br>
I don't think we have reached that stage in our discussion of truth<br>
yet.  So far I see people either idolatrizing truth or demonizing<br>
it...  real analysis will begin once people start looking at both<br>
the useful and the disadvantageous sides of our guiding ideal, our<br>
love of truth. It is not our only guiding ideal.<br>
<p>
By "a guiding ideal that has evolved over time", I mean a poorly<br>
understood active information structure encoded in human brains<br>
that has developed mostly through a process of cultural (meme?)<br>
evolution that could very easily have been entirely beyond the ken<br>
of the people in whose brains the development was taking place.<br>
An unintended consequence, like most of the good things in life.<br>
I try to keep my discussion of such things as "truth" fairly<br>
concrete; it seems to me to be the only way to proceed in investigating<br>
something that has resisted investigation for so many millenia.<br>
This is why I agree so emphatically with the Churchlands that<br>
philosophers in our day and age need to attend to neuroscientific<br>
data and neuroscientific theory.<br>
