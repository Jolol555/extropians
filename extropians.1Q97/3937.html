<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I explained that quite clearly many times: if you sell me a product,</i><br>

<i>&gt; government will step in and prevent me from doing so /at my expense/.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Protecting a market at public expense is no less a subsidy than just</i><br>

<p>
Oh the emperor is declothed, and he is a theif. You say,"then I use the<br>
ideas". That right there is your crime. Then inventor has gone through<br>
enormous expense in terms of research and development and you have gone<br>
and stolen the benefits of that investment without proper compensation.<br>
In this case, sir, YOU ARE A THEIF!.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Another falsehood. By granting the creator a monopoly on use of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; particular invention, a technological leapfrog effect is encouraged,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; where other companies and individuals, in order to compete, must invent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the next greater refinement. Not having this system would stultify</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; technological advancement as everyone would produce the same technology,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and competition would be quashed, productivity would stagnate, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; economy would be swamped by overpopulation operating on restricted</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you're just going to parrot tired old justifications, show me some</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence to back it up.  I refuse to accept your naked assertions, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have attempted to give some evidence that industry and publishing</i><br>
<i>&gt; flourished in the absence of what you claim is necessary.  James Watt</i><br>
<i>&gt; became a very wealthy and creative man, as he deserved, and asked no</i><br>
<i>&gt; one to grant him any monopoly on his creations.  The great works of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Shakespeare, Handel's Messiah, and the Mona Lisa were created without</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit of copyrights.  "IP" is a recent invention, justified by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same blind assumption you continue to make here, but not supported by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the facts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
You cite works of art and inventions developed prior to over 95% of all<br>
inventions in human history. That the present system has encouraged the<br>
other 95% in as short a time as the last century indicates that the<br>
present system is more conducive to technological advancement.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If research is cheap, research labor costs would be very low, meaning</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; researcher pay would be low. Thus you would create a disincentive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pursue careers in research, and only the incompetent morons would enter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the field, much like primary education today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So, making research cheap and easy is /bad/, now?  Amazing.  Do you</i><br>
<i>&gt; even believe in the free market at all?  That products will increase</i><br>
<i>&gt; in quality as the market demands?  And when information is cheap, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; value of /selection/ and /evaluation/ of information goes up, leading</i><br>
<i>&gt; to a market for people with enough brains to find and sort through all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the information.  Again, this I outlined in my earlier posts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The occurence of a truly new and spectacular idea from nothing is a rare</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and wonderful event--Newton's gravity, Darwin's evolution, and Einstein's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; general relativity are the only ones I can think of,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; none are inventions. They were scientific discoveries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What's the /objectively definable/ difference between discovering the</i><br>
<i>&gt; inverse-square law of gravity and the LZW compression algorithm, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural order spreadsheet recalculation, or a process for making soap,</i><br>
<i>&gt; all of which are patented?</i><br>
<p>
The law of gravity is merely a discovery of knowledge of the existing<br>
structure of the universe, while the others are artifical constructs<br>
created by the human mind. That there is the difference between a<br>
discovery and an invention.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They are so now only because there is an IP system in place which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; encourages and has encouraged their proliferation. Its interesting that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you had no comment on my analysis showing that the average "dime a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dozen" invention was worth 4.55 million man hours in terms of relative</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; scarcity. if that is your opinion of the value of invention, I hesistate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to ask what your opinion is of the work of the common man. (Nuff cotton</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; deah, boss?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't remember any such analysis, but I'll look for it--but once again,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you beg the very question by defining "invention" as "issued patent",</i><br>
<i>&gt; further misvalued by the existing anti-market system.  Such an analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt; is as invalid for justifying itself as saying that drugs cause prison</i><br>
<i>&gt; costs, therefore we need more drug laws.  Can't you see that circularity?</i><br>
<p>
An invention which earns a patent not only is something actually new<br>
under the sun, but also of high enough market value to be worth the<br>
effort of pursuing the patent process. As for your circular claim, there<br>
is no such thing in my argument.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The labor of any man--in any field--is worth precisely what he can sell</i><br>
<i>&gt; it for in a free market.  When Joe Montana makes a pass, his labor is</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth thousands of dollars, because that's what people will pay to see it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; When the cameraman gets paid to film it, his labor is worth whatever the</i><br>
<i>&gt; network is paying him.  When the network broadcasts it, they charge for</i><br>
<i>&gt; commercial time whatever advertisers will pay.  49 years from now,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when Joe has stopped making passes and the cameraman retires, the network</i><br>
<i>&gt; can still collect royalties from someone who taped the game on his home</i><br>
<i>&gt; VCR and plays it for his friends, not because they would pay voluntarily,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but because the government say so.  Where's the "labor" there?</i><br>
<p>
Ah you show that you do not understand the economics of it. First off,<br>
"fair use" has been declared legal, as is personal use, which is why you<br>
can make as many copies as you want, so long as you gain no commercial<br>
satisfaction from them.<br>
<p>
Now, Joe was paid on contract for his services. The organization which<br>
invested in his services have taken a risk, which they value in current<br>
dollars at a discounted rate from future earnings. Joe didn't take the<br>
risk, the company investors did, so they are who earns the downstream<br>
royalties from the broadcast. Just as you, who did a great job<br>
developing your compression algorithms, were under contract to Piclab,<br>
or who ever, and were being paid a salary or fee to do the work "for<br>
hire". your employers made the investment in you to develop the<br>
algorithms. If you had done it all by yourself, you could enjoy the<br>
benefits of that invention. Unfortunately, you are like many corporate<br>
writers, inventors, etc., in that you fall into an individual version of<br>
the trap Benjamin Franklin described: "That nation which shall sacrifice<br>
some measure of freedom for greater security shall wind up with<br>
neither." Because you seek a secure position, you shy away from the role<br>
of entrepreneur, you wind up giving up your rights to benefit from your<br>
creations.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; its interesting that a man who dislikes ad hominem attacks against</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; himself takes such glee in inciting them against others. Additionally,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that you still haven't paid enough attention or havent the intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to figure out that my drive system does not violate conservation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; momentum shows that you are only interested in what you have to say and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not anyone else. I suggest you check your ego at the door.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, but I couldn't resist.  You're right, I don't know anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; about your drive, just the very limited information about it on your</i><br>
<i>&gt; site, which /seems/ to violate conservation of momentum.  Perhaps the</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing does something useful but not exactly what the page seems to say</i><br>
<i>&gt; it does, or that there is something vital not said there.  In any case,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I do apologize for the thinly-veiled ad hominem.  It was an attempt at</i><br>
<i>&gt; humor, not a serious diparagement (not that I would shirk from serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; disparagement for other reasons!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That software cannot be patented you seem to have conveniently</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; forgotten.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That over 100,000 algorithms /are/ patented you seem to not realize.</i><br>
<p>
I wasn't aware of the exact number but I was aware that algorithms were<br>
patentable.<br>

Nice vow of poverty, Reverend. This is, IMHO, not a statement of free<br>
market principle, but of anti-market sentiment veiled as piety.<br>
