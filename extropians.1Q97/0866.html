I recently had an interesting insight into the eternal conflict between<br>
emotion and intellect:  I finally realized how such a conflict is even<br>
theoretically possible.<br>
<p>
I once took the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). <br>
Aside from my disagreement with the touchy-feely nature of the questions<br>
and the astrological-oid personality assessments, my main issue was with<br>
questions like:  "Do you follow your head, or your heart?"  I never<br>
perceived the two as being in conflict, and I didn't see how they could<br>
be.<br>
<p>
Just recently, I realized that what was meant by the question was a<br>
conflict between two emotions, one of which had stronger rational<br>
support.  Okay, now I get it.  The answer to the MMPI question:  I don't<br>
know.<br>
<p>
Why was I baffled earlier?  Because I saw emotions and intelligence as<br>
belonging to two different spectrums of the brain.  In retrospect,<br>
emotions are the affective aspects of our goal-oriented cognitive<br>
systems while intelligence is, well, everything else.  Reasoning,<br>
maybe.  How can a goal-object come into conflict with a<br>
reasoning-object?  Doesn't make sense.  Ah, but reasoning-objects give<br>
rise to goal-objects, so you can have one goal strongly supported by<br>
reasoning but of low perceived value, and a contradictory goal of high<br>
value supported by the ur-goal emotions - survival, eating, sleeping,<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
The basic conflict seems to derive from the two primary slots of goal<br>
objects:  Justification and value.  It's possible to have goals of<br>
complex, high justification but low value, or simple, elementary<br>
justification but high value.  Under such circumstances, I go with the<br>
high-justification goal if I have adequate mental energy or<br>
self-control, or branch a sub-goal of going with the high goal if I<br>
don't.<br>
<p>
An example of an "emotion-reason conflict" might be working vs.<br>
sleeping.  Working has many rational justifications, but the actual act<br>
of work is not itself rewarding and resistance builds up.  This<br>
resistance, which acts along a behavioral rather than justificational<br>
channel and which thus is not subject to simple mental control, reduces<br>
the perceived value of work.  Sleeping has no rational justification (if<br>
adequate sleep has been acheived) but is an ur-goal, an emotional<br>
primitive, and thus has a high perceived *value* even if fewer<br>
justifications.<br>
<p>
This is of course only one class of "emotion-reason conflicts", that<br>
dealing with clashes along the "value" slot.  There are also clashes<br>
along the "justification" slot, such as intuition, or experience,<br>
conflicting with reason.  From analogy and personal experience, giving<br>
an example is left to the reader.<br>
<p>
The generalized pattern in both cases seems to be an ur-value or<br>
ur-justification coming into conflict with a rational justification<br>
sequence.  Ur-values are emotions; ur-justifications are generally<br>
called "intuitions".  In the case of emotions, I try to follow the<br>
rational justification sequence because that's what works; in the case<br>
of intuitions, experience shows that the best course is to incorporate<br>
my intuitions in the opposing logic, and if that fails... I don't know;<br>
it never does.<br>
<p>
This concludes this week's lecture on cognitive science and "How To<br>
Think."  Comments?<br>
