        <br>
<p>
Max Planck started the entire revolution by proposing that energy is NOT <br>
continuous, everything followed from there. Take a beam of light for example, <br>
it has momentum nhf, h is the Planck constant, f is the frequency of the <br>
light, and n is an INTEGER, the number of photons. Digital.<br>
<p>
If you want to find the momentum of an individual photon, hf, you can find it <br>
by using the formula hN/X , h is the Planck constant again, and N is the <br>
number of wave crests the photon makes over a distance X. Digital. <br>
<p>
If you want to find the energy of a photon multiply the digital momentum by a  <br>
constant, the speed of light. Digital.<br>
<p>
Of course, there is a basic randomness built into the fabric of the universe, <br>
so if we were to actually perform this experiment when we got near the end of <br>
distance X it would not be entirely clear if we should include the last wave <br>
crest or not. We could minimize this problem and get a more accurate <br>
measurement of momentum by making X bigger, but then you'd know less about <br>
the position of the photon, X. Momentum and position have an inverse <br>
relationship, the more you know about one the less you know about the other, <br>
however randomness is NOT a continuous quantity, in fact it is as far from <br>
that concept as it is possible to get.<br>
<p>
As for matter, it comes in particles, it is not smeared around, only the  <br>
probability of finding it. If you look for an electron at a particular spot <br>
you may find one or you may not, you can't be certain, the best you can do is <br>
come up with probabilities. However one thing you CAN be absolutely certain<br>
of is that you will find an electron OR you will not. Digital. There is no <br>
middle ground, there is no chance you will find half an electron or "sort of" <br>
an electron. If an electron is detected when it hits a phosphorous screen it <br>
will produce a photon of light. If it is not detected it will not produce a<br>
photon of light. There are no other possibilities, it will never produce <br>
half a photon of light. If an electron is detected it ALWAYS acts like a <br>
particle. The probability of finding the particle acts like a wave and is <br>
not deterministic hence the random element.                                      <br>
                                                    <br>
