My $.02: the lookup table presents no problem if you regard passing<br>
the Turing Test as a likely indication of consciousness or intelligence, <br>
but not as a defining criterion of intelligence.<br>
<p>
Consider the "Thermometer Test" for the presence of heat. If you<br>
stick a thermometer in an unknown liquid and the mercury shoots up<br>
the column, you have reason to believe that the liquid is hot.<br>
But "being hot" is not the same thing as "being disposed to cause <br>
mercury to expand", and there are other ways to make mercury rise.<br>
<p>
In other words: why would anyone think that the Turing Test was<br>
foolproof? If you really want to *know* whether an entity is a<br>
person / is conscious / is intelligent - having first adequately<br>
clarified your concept - you may just need to know something<br>
about its implementation, as well as its behavior. (Actually,<br>
I would have thought that a functionalist would agree on this<br>
count, since functionalism cares about internal causation.)<br>
