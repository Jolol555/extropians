Here's some info for Jim on examples of mercantilism, and is NOT<br>

NEWS FROM THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY<br>
2600 Virginia Avenue, NW, Suite 100<br>

Libertarians urge: End corporate welfare<br>
for Ronald McDonald and his rich friends<br>
<p>
        WASHINGTON, DC -- Ronald McDonald is a welfare cheat.<br>
<p>
        Despite billions in profits last year, the fast-food chain<br>
represented by the popular clown mascot pocketed $1.6 million in<br>
taxpayers' money in 1996, the Libertarian Party noted today.<br>
<p>
        "There's been a lot of talk about welfare for individuals, but<br>
not much about the billions in taxpayers' money raked in by wealthy<br>
corporations," said the party's chairman, Steve Dasbach. "Thanks to<br>
Republican and Democratic politicians, corporate welfare is alive and<br>
well-financed in America."<br>
<p>
        In Ronald McDonald's case, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's<br>
Market Access Program funneled $1.6 million in tax money to help the<br>
multibillion-dollar corporation advertise its Big Macs and other<br>
fast-food products to Europeans.<br>
<p>
         "Anyone with a McNugget of common sense should be outraged by<br>
programs like these," Dasbach said.<br>
<p>
         But the tide may be turning. A number of groups say they are<br>
committed to ending the subsidies, which total at least $30 billion a<br>
year. At a news conference this week, at least a dozen such programs<br>
were targeted for termination.<br>
<p>
        "It's about time," said Dasbach. "Libertarians have been urging<br>
Congress for 25 years to end these subsidies."<br>
<p>
        A bill sponsored by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russell<br>
Feingold (D-WI) would set up a nine-member study commission to target<br>
corporate welfare programs, and Congress would have four months to<br>
approve or reject the recommendations.<br>
<p>
         "But what's to study?" Dasbach asked. "Average Americans<br>
shouldn't be forced to fork over their hard-earned money to business<br>
executives. Let's topple these corporate fat cats from the welfare<br>
wagon right now."<br>
<p>
        Dasbach suggested some targets for immediate action:<br>
<p>
        * Mickey Mouse behavior: The Walt Disney Corporation received<br>
$300,000 in 1995 to "help perfect its fireworks displays," according to<br>
research by Common Cause.<br>
<p>
        * Boondoggle for billionaires: The Archer-Daniels Midland food<br>
company -- which earned $13 billion last year -- has socked taxpayers<br>
with a bill for $6 billion in ethanol subsidies over the last decade.<br>
<p>
        * The whine industry: After Gallo and other California wine<br>
makers poured $750,000 into Democratic and Republican congressional<br>
campaigns, politicians returned the favor: Gallo uncorked $7 million in<br>
federal subsidies in 1994. The funding went to boost Gallo wine sales<br>
in Asia and Latin America under an "export promotion program," which<br>
has paid California wineries over $50 million in the last 10 years.<br>
<p>
        * Putting the squeeze on taxpayers: Sunkist Corporation has<br>
received $78 million from the Agriculture Department since 1976 to<br>
promote its oranges in Asia.<br>
<p>
        * A little log rolling: The Forest Service has handed lumber<br>
companies $3 billion over five years in taxpayer-financed roads to pave<br>
the way for logging projects.<br>
<p>
        * What's mined is yours: Exploiting the Department of<br>
Interior's Mining Law of 1872, gold and silver companies purchased<br>
public land last year containing $15.3 billion in resources for a<br>
paltry $9,400.<br>
<p>
        "Every taxpayer who learns about these programs wants them<br>
eliminated immediately," Dasbach said. "But politicians and their rich,<br>
corporate friends have fought to protect them. It's time to protect<br>
taxpayers instead -- and shut the corporate welfare checkbook."<br>
