===(David Cary)===<br>
I've heard an interesting study in which it was claimed that, in some<br>
cases, *no* shielding was better than any reasonable amount of<br>
shielding.  The argument was that, with no shielding, a high-energy<br>
cosmic ray would hit and utterly destroy one DNA molecule in an<br>
organism. However, with "small" amounts of shielding, the high-energy<br>
cosmic ray would hit the shield and generate lots and lots of low-energy<br>
particles, which would spread out and damage many, many cells of the<br>
organism. The authors argued that the amount of shielding which would be<br>
thick enough to catch all these low-energy particles was totally<br>
unreasonable.<br>
===<br>
<p>
I've been reading O'Neill's _2081_ and _The High Frontier_.  He said<br>
about 2 meters of outer crud would be necessary to block radiation.  You<br>
need much less to block solar alpha particles and the like, but then the<br>
high energy cosmics cause the above problem, so you end up with the<br>
larger number.  (Actually, you don't need much to block normal solar<br>
alphas, but those solar storms get nasty.)  It seems to me that a fair<br>
depth of soil, plus heavy meteor shielding, should handle the radiation<br>
problem anyway for colonies.  Getting around is a different problem; I<br>
hope storms are short enough that one can wait them out.  <br>
<p>
This looks like an incentive to have large manned ships.<br>
<p>
Another thing is that the inner solar system is usually considered the<br>
place to be for energy and communications.  But after reading O'Neill's<br>
ideas for deep space colonies, basically involving a very large mirror,<br>
it struck me that the outer system might be more desirable.  Or that the<br>
biozone for habitats is wider and farther out than usually thought.<br>
Because while energy is richer close to the sun, so is radiation.  _If_<br>
large but thin mirrors aren't too unwieldy to make and maintain, then by<br>
doubling your distance you need to quadruple your collectors but can cut<br>
your shielding by 3/4, because the mirror _doesn't_ focus the radiation<br>
-- if it did shielding wouldn't be a problem in the first place.  So<br>
there should be some range where the mass of shielding saved makes up<br>
for the mass of a larger mirror.<br>
<p>
Of course shielding can be crud, whereas the mirror presuably has some<br>
material requirements.  I don't know what they're usually thought to be<br>
made of, though.  Ag?  Al?  Chromium?  Sheets of conducting graphitics?<br>
<p>
