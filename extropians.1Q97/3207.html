I admit a bias toward liberalism; more precisely, I consider myself<br>
extremely receptive toward new and halfway plausible ideas, often<br>
getting very excited over them.  For a few days, since I never do<br>
anything with the ideas for some time, allowing criticism or lack of<br>
sustainable interest to prevent silly things from happening.  And I<br>
think this is a neat strategy.<br>
<p>
But Sulloway's idea was that first France, and then the rest of the<br>
West, became more conservative due to changes in family patterns.  And<br>
that China might go out the other end.  Whatever one thinks of the<br>
"right" amount of conservatism, or whether there is such a beast, the<br>
idea that society's attitudes might change through this mechanism is<br>
rather provocative.<br>
