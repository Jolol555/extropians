In Oct. '95 I posted to Extropians in praise of <br>
Strauss &amp; Howe's '91 book "Generations" saying:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I found this to be the most striking book about the future I've read</i><br>
<i>&gt;since Engines of Creation.  The data presented in favor of their model</i><br>
<i>&gt;seems substantial, though it is not quantitiative.  If correct, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;future of society is much more predictable than I ever thought possible.</i><br>
<p>
(I was then told Tim Starr had posted about it 6 months earlier.)<br>
<p>
This year Strauss &amp; Howe came out with a sequel, "The Fourth Turning",<br>
endorsed by both Gore &amp; Gingrich. (See:  <a href="http://www.fourthturning.com">http://www.fourthturning.com</a>)<br>
<p>
A good detailed review is:  <a href="http://pages.prodigy.com/VBDS39A/tft.htm">http://pages.prodigy.com/VBDS39A/tft.htm</a><br>
<p>
But let me quickly echo my earlier comments.  I consider myself to be<br>
a grump with high standards: most outrageous ideas are junk, and I<br>
hope that by being very selective in endorsing very few ideas, the few<br>
endorsements I make (such as pro-cryonics) will be taken seriously.<br>
So please listen when I say (and note how unusual this statement is): <br>
<p>
  STRAUSS &amp; HOWE ARE RADICAL, IMPORTANT, AND PROBABLY MOSTLY RIGHT!<br>
<p>
They give crucial insights into the next thirty years, crucial to<br>
determining whether extropian-types will become scapegoats and<br>
lightning rods in a new age of repression, or will become a core of<br>
a new culture of freedom and possibilities.<br>
<p>
Also, amazingly enough Strauss &amp; Howe &amp; the most of the people<br>
attracted to them seem like relatively reasonable people; there are<br>
few ideologues or demogogues among them. <br>
