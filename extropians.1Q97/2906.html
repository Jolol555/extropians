<i>&gt; &gt; Sound reasonable. But once the clone is accepted as a person, he can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; justly claim the ownership of his own genome and making any clones of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; himself is his decision, not the original clone (hmm, I have to watch</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Multiplicity, I think).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An interesting point.  There shouldn't be any problems with owning your</i><br>
<i>&gt; own genetic code in its entirety, but what about smaller portions? </i><br>
<p>
Just as present parents have joint rights to custody of their children,<br>
and if they are dead, their relatives all have rights based on proximity<br>
of relation.<br>
<p>
<p>
 It's<br>
<i>&gt; been a while since I've studied genetics, but I believe there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; tremendous amounts of reoccurring patterns in our exon DNA.  I'm not</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure about the intron material.  It would be interesting trying to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; introns as a type of PGP signature or copyright mark, but I'm afraid it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be too easily circumvented.  Any 'current' geneticists out there?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Backtracking a bit, I wonder if it could be well argued for the parent's</i><br>
<i>&gt; ownership of a child's code?  (Another factor for divorce court. . .)</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the code is owned by each individual, would it be illegal for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents to manufacture twins?</i><br>
<p>
Nope, each parent has shared biological rights to their children, and a<br>
legal right to contribute any portion, whole or part to a reproductive<br>
act.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Regarding ownership of one's one code:  If a clone was made by the owner</i><br>
<i>&gt; (in this example one's self) and now two individuals owned rights to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; code, as you've suggested, the legalities of one clone selling genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; information to another party might be interesting.  Also, what happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; if an illegal (as defined by this example) clone were made?  Clearly it</i><br>
<i>&gt; could not be denied its rights, could it?</i><br>
<p>
I would say that the original has rights as a fraction in inverse<br>
proportion to the number of generations removed that the new clone is.<br>
Likewise, just as decendants of President Zachary Taylor had rights ( or<br>
rather a responsibility to protect their heritage) as to the exhumation<br>
of his body for an autopsy to determine actual cause of death,<br>
decendants are responsible for safeguarding their genetic heritage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, how long would one's genetic material remain under copyright?</i><br>
<i>&gt; How long after death?  Depending on that answer, who owns the currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; deceased?  If it is public domain, do we have the right to exhume their</i><br>
<i>&gt; bodies and claim our property?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is unfortunate that these questions will have to be answered very</i><br>
<i>&gt; soon and probably without much deliberation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I think that the only difference between current family rights and<br>
future as impacted by the reality of cloning is that a clone will have a<br>
100% heritage from one family rather than a partial heritage from each<br>
parent. I think that reproductive rights need to be defined as a right<br>
to one's genetic code. The more it is divvied up or decended from, the<br>
more dilute the rights, but they are still there. <br>
