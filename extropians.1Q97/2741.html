Pardon me for being crude, but I don't recall anyone mentioning that we<br>
are hard-wired to be political. We're mammals, that's why we don't defer to<br>
political experts.<br>
<p>
Scientists and philosophers are viewed, on a visceral level, as people that<br>
don't pose much of a threat to our territory. They are perceived as less likely<br>
to make off with our mates, and their brain over braun development makes them<br>
easy to beat up.<br>
<p>
Political leaders, on the other hand, are more likely to be alpha male types<br>
and deference to them instantly gives us lowered status within the tribe.<br>
<p>
Deference to experts in scientific matters doesn't threaten our status. I<br>
realize we should be beyond all this, and that this may be a very "male"<br>
viewpoint.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
	-Mike<br>
