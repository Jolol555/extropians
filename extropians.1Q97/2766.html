<i>&gt; This is so dogmatic sounding, I see many things more beautiful than trade.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Profit, yeah yeah... dollars, yes please, lots of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Trade is GREAT!!... yet it is not the ONLY thing  a happy life revolves</i><br>
<i>&gt; around, life is about expression. Creativity. Feeling ( oh no ,not feelings</i><br>
<i>&gt; again!). Joy. Acheivement. Discovery! Social interactions of a relaxed, non</i><br>
<i>&gt; traderlike nature  (sometimes just fun, or romantic love). OH yes, my dear,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it is true our world needs repair,  to respect "Self Empowerment" and life</i><br>
<i>&gt; supporting memes, and the anti-trade altruism (zero sum game as Ayn Randians</i><br>
<i>&gt; like to call it) is a poisonous meme. This can be countered by consciously</i><br>
<i>&gt; embracing, -among other things-, a good , solid, ethical trader principle..</i><br>
<i>&gt; but there is more to life than this kind of yawn...  dollars, work ethics,</i><br>
<i>&gt; principles, debates, being "right'... yawn...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You may be  right, but then, you may be missing out on something fun!</i><br>
<p>
Not for a minute.  Please don't drop the context of the discussion; I<br>
made no mention at all of /why/ I value life, only the principle with<br>
which to interact with others consequent to valuing life.  Life is valued<br>
because of all those wonderful things you mention--that are no less<br>
precious to me than to you.  Breathtaking beauty, romantic love, sensuous<br>
delights, intellectual challenge, humor, friendship--those are the things<br>
that make life worth living--that give it value.  Because it has value, <br>
and because peaceful coexistence with others who have those values is also<br>
valuable to me, I act to obtain those values peaceably and honestly.  Free<br>
trade is a /consequence/ of the value of life, not what makes it valuable.<br>
<p>
You are making a category error to compare trade with "other things" in<br>
life.  It is not competing with those "other" things; it is not in the<br>
same category.  Trade is a principle of human interaction, not a value<br>
in itself.  You can't compare them on the same scale any more than one<br>
can compare weight and length with "benevolence".  It's like I was<br>
discussing what kind of music I like, and someone says "Yeah, Bach is<br>
OK, but what about Fettucine Alfredo?" <br>
<p>
Now since obtaining those things generally means interacting with others<br>
(because some involve others, and some we just can't each make ourselves),<br>
it follows that trade will be involved in most aspects of one's day-<br>
to-day life.  We're not hunter gatherers anymore.  Most societies  in the<br>
present era have moved from hunter-gatherer to slave/exploiter.  Hopefully<br>
we can progress further to free traders.  Perhaps in some long-distant<br>
future in a different technological world, something even better might<br>
be possible (say, immortal non-consuming explorers), but not yet.<br>
