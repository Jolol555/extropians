Now there, Eliezer. While you're falling into your private Singularity... <br>
take a look over your shoulder. This is still old-fashioned 1997. Not every <br>
interesting physical phenomenon gives rise to slick tech. Even more <br>
importantly, if it does, it does not happen overnight. qubits by NMR, a <br>
viable computer technology? Ha-ha. E-B condensate, in ubiquious gadgetry?<br>
Pretty damn unlikely. A beam writer for tiny structures sounds neato, <br>
though. Could be instrumental for bootstrap. I still think drextech, <br>
should it be viable, will come from the marriage of chemistry &amp; STM.<br>
