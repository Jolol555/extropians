I'm assuming you actually are a dependent (under 18) -- if this is<br>
incorrect, please let me know.<br>
1) Calm down.  Get your own emotions under control (anger, frustration,<br>
fear, defiance, outrage, etc.) before you do anything else.  Seek<br>
outside help if necessary.<br>
2) Take your parents on a tour of the Christian sites on the Internet,<br>
Usenet, IRC, etc.<br>
3) Try talking to a counselor or teacher and have them talk to your parents<br>
about the good things about the Internet.<br>
4) In the interests of diplomacy, you may want to consider filtering<br>
messages from lucifer.com for a while.  Unreasonable or not, as long<br>
as they pay the bills, they get a say.<br>
5) If the situation becomes truly unbearable, two words:  emancipated minor.<br>
<p>
Good luck.<br>
