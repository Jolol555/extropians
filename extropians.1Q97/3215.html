<i>&gt;&gt;I found this to be the most striking book about the future I've read</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;since Engines of Creation.  The data presented in favor of their model</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;seems substantial, though it is not quantitiative.  If correct, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;future of society is much more predictable than I ever thought possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;[RH]</i><br>
<p>
"data" ... "not quantitative" is a contradiction.  Data are numbers.<br>
Measurements.  Surveys.  Experimental results.  If you can't measure<br>
it, there's no way to know whether your vague feeling of connectedness<br>
is something real and testable, or if it's just the wanderings of a<br>
random pattern-matching machine run amok, finding patterns caused by<br>
pure chance and baselessly extrapolating them into the future.<br>
<p>
Those who postulate explanations for any phenomenon--social, physical,<br>
or any other--must have some means of stating precisely what their<br>
explantion predicts, and then have some way of measuring the actual<br>
result to test the prediction, or else their conjectures no more<br>
falsifiable than theology, and don't qualify as knowledge.  If they<br>
are simply describing things for artistic reasons, or pointing out<br>
suggestive parallels, that's great; but if they are making actual<br>
predictions of real events in a system with 5 billion degrees of<br>
freedom, they'd better have more than a subjective feeling.<br>
<p>
Drexler's books for the masses may not have had much raw data (there<br>
certainly were some, but a lot less than one might expect in a more<br>
academic paper), but Drexler himself did the math, and did it right.<br>
Drexler knows precisely the speed of chemical reactions; the size of<br>
DNA molecules; the amount of data in a complex computer program; the<br>
size of the spaces between cells.  Without those real numbers, based<br>
on real measurements of known phenomena, the idea of "incredibly small<br>
machines that build things from atoms" would be nothing more than a<br>
good science fiction hook.  The numbers make it real.<br>
