I've never had trouble telling them apart, just from headers and<br>
signatures.  Same here: our "From:" lines are rather different, our<br>
signatures are quite distinct (I think to think I'm flashier in both<br>
regards) and even our attribution lines are different, not to mention by<br>
using '}' as a delimiter.  I've criticized your notions of Powers and<br>
the Singularity, along with arguing over lunar warfare and defending<br>
English orthography.<br>

(Really now, my minimal signature is -xx- &lt;name&gt; X-), not to mention the<br>
rest.  I don't want to be warlorded, but I'd think it'd stand out a bit.)<br>
