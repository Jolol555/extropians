<i>&gt;Also, I wonder what the order of magnitude is that we're talking about here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I assume that much of the cranial nerve structure would be carried across</i><br>

<i>&gt;themselves, would be transplanted, rather than attempting a hook-up to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"trade-in's" eyes.  </i><br>
<p>
'Course, in my case it looks like the eyes would be one of the things I'd<br>
like to replace.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This would be more difficult with the nerves that serve</i><br>
<i>&gt;the mouth and tounge, etc, but might not be insurmountable.  </i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately motor nerves are wired "live" like retinal nerves.  They have<br>
some regenerative capacity, but it mostly consists of growing down the<br>
channels laid before.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If this were</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible, then the connections across the spinal column would then be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;biggest challenge.  How many nerves are we talking about at that juncture?</i><br>
<p>
Lots.  Hundreds of nerves, millions of individual cells.  Remember we can't<br>
even treat sciatica reliably yet.  <br>
