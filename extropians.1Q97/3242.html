Lee Daniel Crocker answered:<br>
<i>&gt;If I wanted to make specific predictions about them, I'd have to have</i><br>
<i>&gt;some way to test whether my actual results matched my descriptions ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;What makes it specifically quantitative is that I can rigorously</i><br>
<i>&gt;define what the measurement is, and I can repeat the experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough times to calculate a t-test or other measure of the probability</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the measurements are chance or that they correlate to some cause.</i><br>
<i>&gt;99% of the measurements you make are subconscious, so you're right</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I don't have to count every step or label every room to get to</i><br>
<i>&gt;where I'm going.  But to make predictions, or to explain things to</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone else, I'd better make them more explicit: ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not discounting the value of human pattern-matching machinery.</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's what gives us conjectures to test, and it is a very valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt;skill.  But until they are defined, measured, and tested, it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;very dangerous game to make predictions on pattern alone.</i><br>
<p>
Now I'm confused.  Are you saying that you can go about your life,<br>
such as walking through new buildings or driving on new streets<br>
without making any predictions based on all those subconscious<br>
measurements you make?  All it gives you are "conjectures to test"?<br>
You don't predict "Hmm.. I think going up those stairs would probably<br>
get me to the second floor"?  Or are you saying you do predict but<br>
that it is "dangerous"?  (relative to what?)<br>
<p>
And when I said that Strauss &amp; Howe don't give quantitiative data, I<br>
meant that they refer to relevant historical facts as evidence, but<br>
that they don't map them onto numbers nor organize them in a way that<br>
would make a statistical analysis convenient.  This sounds like data<br>
just as much as your visual perceptions of a building.  <br>
