I have definitely ambivalent feelings about cloning humans.  It's possible<br>
to see good coming out of it.  It's easy to see real weirdness coming out of<br>
it (Micheal Jackson clones himself, brings back the Jackson Five with an all<br>
Michael band).  <br>
<p>
For all the good intentioned debate, I don't think there's any doubt that<br>
cloning humans will happen, it will happen sooner than anybody anticipates,<br>
and it will eventually become commonplace.  <br>
<p>
My predictions:<br>
<p>
1.  Clinton's ban on federal funded cloning research is made permanent.<br>
        <br>
2.  Congress tries to ban all cloning research but fails by a vote or two,<br>
after pleas by Harold Varmus and a lobbying group formed by Amgen, Biogen,<br>
Genentech, Monsanto, and the National Intitutes of Health.<br>
<p>
3.  Meanwhile, someone opens up a cloning clinic in Anguilla.<br>
    Cloning research in Europe and the US goes underground  (there has<br>
always been underground research.  Several scientists were thrown out of<br>
good positions when they used genetic engineering in ways that were orinally<br>
banned, eg one of my thesis advisors.)<br>
<p>
4.  Extropy Istitute opens up a Tissue Bank for Transhuman Cloning.<br>
Transhumans worldwide start freezing bits of themselves in anticipation of<br>
further progress in cloning research.<br>
<p>
4.  Somebody notices that the cloning clinic in Anguilla is making money.<br>
Congress is upset because the Americans are losing the technological cloning<br>
race to Anguilla.<br>
<p>
5.  Cloning becomes the hot button issue of the year 2004 presidential race.<br>
Republican nominee Pat Buchanan and incumbent Southern Baptist Al Gore agree<br>
that cloning humans is against the will of God.  Corporate money pours into<br>
the coffers of the Libertarian Party.<br>
<p>
6.  President Max More rescinds the cloning ban, asserting that it is<br>
"inimical to Libertarian Party principles" as well as the "American<br>
tradition of individual choice."<br>
<p>
7. Albert Einstein is exhumed and cloned in multiple copies.  Einstein<br>
develops a group mind as an Evil Genius that takes over the world,<br>
generating millions of copies of himself.  <br>
 <br>
et cetera...<br>
