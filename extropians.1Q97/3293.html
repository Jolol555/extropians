<i>&gt; OK, so how does a monopoly benefit from inflation?  </i><br>
<p>
Hmm.  Not sure which basic Econ books best deal with those issues.<br>
You might start with Friedman's "Price Theory" (which you can get<br>
online from his web site &lt;<a href="http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/">http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/</a>&gt;), but a more<br>
general Econ work might be better.  Monopoly-issued currencies tend<br>
to inflate because the issuer can use inflation to essentially tax<br>
every piece of currency they have issued, transferring some of its<br>
value from the holders to the issuer, without having to go out and<br>
steal it physically.  Just double the amount of currency presently<br>
in circulation; it's worth half as much, but now you own half of it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I know that's exactly the problem in America.  The FED is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fractional-reserve system, isn't it?  Also, ever since the Fed has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; in existence, we've lost our gold standard, correct?  Hong Kong still</i><br>
<i>&gt; works on the gold standard?  How well is their economy? ...</i><br>
<p>
I don't want to get into the whole fractional-reserve debate here; I can<br>
go to humanities.philosophy.objectivism for that.  I'll just say that no,<br>
I don't think fractional-reserve banking is a problem of itself; in fact,<br>
I think it's a great way to do business.  The problem is non-fixed value<br>
currency issued by a monopoly.<br>
<p>
No, Hong Kong is not on a gold standard.  That sentence was a bit<br>
ambiguous; I meant to say only that they have no government-issued<br>
currency; their primary currencies are privately issued by two banks.<br>
Their economy does quite well, but I think it would be unfair to<br>
compare it to the US, which has so many more natural resources than<br>
they do.<br>
