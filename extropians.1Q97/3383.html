<p>
Not you are the boss. The population of the country is the boss. If everyone decides<br>
that they don't want the state anymore, the state can be "fired".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I *do* agree that this is often not the case today.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On of the great understatements of all time.</i><br>
<p>
Nope. In many cases the state does quite good work. But all these cases are more and <br>
more "privatized", leaving the state as a vampire who takes much from the many and <br>
few from the few, while doing few for the many and much for the few. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;The problem is that government is too corrupt and influenced         </i><br>
<i>&gt;(usually even set up) by economy.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; True, but that's not because we were just unlucky and elected the wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt; politicians, it's inherent in the system. Suppose I want to make $10,000,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there are two ways to go about it. I can work to repeal hundreds of special</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest laws, each one costing me a few dollars, or I can lobby for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; passage of one more special interest law that will give me and my friends</i><br>
<i>&gt; $10,000 and cost everybody else a dollar or two. The second method makes much</i><br>
<i>&gt; more sense, it's far easier to pass one law than to repeal hundreds .</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This sort of lobbying won't work in the free market. If I want an executive</i><br>
<i>&gt; at GM to be promoted to a  position of greater power there is only one thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can do to help that come about, purchase the product that the executive has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been advocating. Bribery will help the executive's bank account but it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; not help his chances for advancement, it will hurt it because his boss will</i><br>
<i>&gt; note that his decisions have been poor and do  not made economic sense.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The stockholders will note the same thing.</i><br>
<p>
Which essentially means: If the decisions the customers make are right, the right <br>
people will have the power (although monopolies will form) and the right products <br>
will be produced. The problem is that the customers' decisions are usually not for <br>
the best product available but for the product most advertised.<br>
<p>
I agree that the "government bug" is inherent. There are ways to change it, though. <br>
In order to do it, we need more state, not less, and better information for those who <br>
influence the state.<br>
<p>
Look at Japan. Much state influence. Great country. Imagine Japan had started with <br>
free markets after WW II, they'd be like South Korea today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;For government does not have a general interest in acting  "evil",</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;but big biz has, in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt; - sell more</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What on Earth is evil about selling something to somebody who wants to buy it?</i><br>
<p>
Read the sentence. I didn't say that THIS was evil, but the effect is. (No one is <br>
evil in this game, that's why I usually don't use this word.) As a consequence, the <br>
state will be corrupted and thus provide worse services.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;- pay  fewer taxes</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What on Earth is evil about protecting you possessions from theft?</i><br>
<p>
I have nothing against rich people who spend their money in big cars or houses etc., <br>
the money stays in movement. But it is "evil" (to use *your* words) if companies and <br>
banks invest money in the stock market where it just circulates. This is where the <br>
big money acucmulates. To nearly no one's benefit. The money invested in stock <br>
markets gets to (large) companies again. But these large companies tend to re-invest <br>
the money in stock markets instead of making investments in their company, for the <br>
stock market promises a higher profit! So the money available decreases, few people <br>
get richer and richer but without *using* the money -- only to get richer. And the <br>
amount of CIRCULATING money decreases.<br>
<p>
This is why the capitalist system will break down faster if it's liberated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;- get rid of competitors</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are two ways a company could get rid of competitors.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) It could become more efficient than the competition. This would mean that</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the company would be producing a product that individuals chose because</i><br>
<i>&gt;    they liked it better than the alternative. In the name of human freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt;    this horrible state of affairs can not be allowed, the government sees to</i><br>
<i>&gt;    that.</i><br>
<p>
Ah yeah, free decision again. Your catchword.<br>
<p>
Free decision is, of course, an illusion. A decision can never be free, for the <br>
decider is influenced by various sources. A buying decision is mainly influenced by <br>
advertising. For to decide which product to buy, the consumer must know<br>
<p>
 - which products are available (biggest problem)<br>
 - which products promise to be best<br>
 - why the products are best<br>
<p>
Linux has not become a comfortable standard operating system for PCs because most <br>
people don't know about it. But even if Linux was told about in all larger computer <br>
magazines (impossible because Microsoft's influence is there, too), most people would <br>
buy Microsoft because of its better advertising.<br>
<p>
Advertising manipulates. Manipulation of all kind is much easier in free markets.<br>
<p>
Everything would be fine if all information would be accessible AND centralized in <br>
one archive (for why should the average user ever visit a Linux website?). But this <br>
is not the case with the web, and even the web would probably not be preserved in <br>
free markets for economic reasons. Don't forget that the really large net capacities <br>
are owned by the state.<br>
<p>
There are lots of different companies, but the largest of them are owned by very few <br>
investment banks. There's your competition -- it's a fake.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) The proper way to deal with a competitor who makes a product that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;    better and cheaper than yours is to use your "clout" to lobby the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    government to regulate your industry. I can't emphasize enough that</i><br>
<i>&gt;    purpose of this regulation is only to increase individual freedom, and of</i><br>
<i>&gt;    course the best way to do that is to have government agents use force or</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the threat of force to stop anyone from making a product superior to mine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    What better way is there to promote free competition?</i><br>
<p>
No one has an interest in making superior products in free markets except for moral <br>
reasons, for <br>
<p>
	- investments in stock markets promise the highest profit to large companies<br>
	- simply killing other companies with force is much cheaper, and if you <br>
	  control the media, no one will learn about it<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;anarchies are  not workable</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who runs the Internet? Does the internet work? Who decided on what the rules</i><br>
<i>&gt; of English should be, and what government agency enforces it? Does English</i><br>
<i>&gt; work?</i><br>
<p>
Who runs my trousers? Do my trousers work? Who runs me? Do I work? Am I an anarchy?  <br>
Philosophical questions..<br>
<p>
Is English or the internet a geographical area where people live together? <br>
<p>
Let's take a deeper look at the net. <br>
Most of it is dull entertainment and worthless information. The newest web browser <br>
with Live3d plugin or Java for spying your computer, the latest sex page, <br>
advertising, advertising, advertising, private homepages containing useless <br>
information about strange people.<br>
<p>
Then there's mail and news, continually being spammed, the more serious newsgroups <br>
being flooded by nazis and other scum. Of all services, these two are most useful. <br>
IRC - usually nonsense talk, everybody is surprised if a serious discussion results. <br>
<p>
Even in the web it becomes obvious how large companies try to crush users who publish <br>
unwanted information, even in the entertainment area. Without laws, companies will be <br>
able to do that much easier.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the internet works. Sure. As long as no serious things are done there, <br>
everything is fine. As soon as big money circulates, goodbye net.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;There is no free market or real  competition, just a search for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;highest profit rates.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I fail to see the distinction. If you're making a ton of money then yours</i><br>
<i>&gt; must be a great business to be in. I'm going to get in too, and I'm going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do my best to make an even higher  profit rate than you do.</i><br>
<p>
The distinction is that the real money is controlled by monopolies, the investment <br>
banks I mentioned.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;those who do the hardest physical work (workers in factories,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;farmers  etc.) usually get the fewest money in  capitalist systems</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, brute strength is the very easiest thing to automate. If a surgeon was</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to cut me open and then put me back together again, I would hope he</i><br>
<i>&gt; could demand more money for his services than somebody whose only skill was</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ability to dig a ditch.</i><br>
<p>
If someone sits in a bureau all the time and just signs or rejects given proposals, I <br>
would hope he could demand less money than someone who works all day so hard that he <br>
even carries away physical and psychological damage from it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;If companies invest, they do not invest in employees but in what</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;promises the highest profit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In other words they pay their employees what they're worth not what they want,</i><br>
<i>&gt; just what you'd expect from an organization that is not a charity. If I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; find somebody who can do your job better than you can and is willing to work</i><br>
<i>&gt; for less, what is wrong with that? Look at it from the other side, suppose</i><br>
<i>&gt; you found somebody who would pay you twice what you make now for fewer hours</i><br>
<i>&gt; of work, would there be anything immoral in you quitting your present job?</i><br>
<p>
They don't pay anyone what he/she's worth, but everyone is paid the fewest money <br>
possible. So if someone is paid 2$/hour in one company, he will get only 2$/hour in <br>
the neighbour company (while there IS still competition -- usually there's just <br>
monopolies after a short period in free markets). <br>
<p>
I'm not talking about the "better" jobs, the "worthier" jobs. BTW, didn't you <br>
criticize that I valued people? Don't you always get totally upset if I call the <br>
majority of the American population uneducated? But their work is worth less than <br>
yours, so if they do work with which they can't earn a living, are they stupid? Of <br>
course they aren't, for they don't have the choice. Maybe they are uneducated because <br>
of media influence and bad education (much worse in free markets).<br>
<p>
I'm talking about the jobs in the industry. The hard work. There's always a high <br>
demand for this work, but a lower and continually decreasing supply. Tell a worker in <br>
Germany that he should quit his job and try to work for more money. The reaction <br>
would be funny. For if you quit a work where the supply is higher than the demand, no <br>
one will pay you more if there are thousands of unemployed people willing to work <br>
at minimum wages. Ah, I forgot, in free markets, there ARE no minimum wages.<br>
<p>
But no matter what you call it, the effect would be that more and more people would <br>
fall into poverty and more and more people would get very, very rich. 360 people <br>
owning 50 % of the world's wealth. That's market control *today*. Do you think that <br>
one of these 360 guys (I think that most of them *are* guys, that's market <br>
emancipation) is able to spend even 1 per cent of his/her money?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Lots of people pay and few get the money. In the end, there's mass</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;poverty, hunger and a few very, very rich (but usually not very</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;clever) guys.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let me see if I have this straight: The problem with the world is that there</i><br>
<i>&gt; are too many greedy people and you want more money. Most are too materialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; and you want more material things. The poor want a more affluent lifestyle,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rich have figured out a way to obtain it, but the poor are more</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent.  Is that about it? Have I missed anything?</i><br>
<p>
Yeah. The wealth must be spread. The point is that nobody should possess more than he <br>
or she is able to spend, as otherwise the wealth will be no longer wealth but only <br>
money, and it will accumulate with no function.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Capitalism is the true pyramid system.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If that's the way you feel about it then the solution is obvious, don't be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalist. I really don't see what your problem is.</i><br>
<p>
There are no realizable alternatives, so the only way to make it is to make the <br>
pyramid as big as possible in order to reach transcension before the collapse. But if <br>
the market is liberated, the collapse will come faster, and billions of people would <br>
have to die of the effects of hunger. Explanation: The collapse would lead to a <br>
feudal system like that of the Middle Ages. Foreign trade would be impossible but is <br>
absolutely necessary in our society.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I only see one motivation that drives all Libertarians. It's not</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the desire for  freedom or the desire for justice. It's pure greed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Oh yeah, and in some cases it's  stupidity.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Oh, now I see. You think you're morally superior to us and are far more</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent.</i><br>
<p>
No. I don't know if you, John Clark, are greedy. I don't think that I'm more <br>
intelligent than you. But I know that you don't have the knowledge necessary to <br>
decide whether free markets are a useful thing or not, and I *think* that I do. You <br>
can prove the opposite any time, but so far I haven't heard any working argument from <br>
you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From reading some of the posts, I think that the core of the Libertarian movement is </i><br>
greedy, but believes in its own ideology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You think we're too stupid to make decisions for ourselves and</i><br>
<i>&gt; for our own good you must do it for us. You'll make us become socialists</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether we want to or not. Erik, can you see why such a policy might cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; some resentment in your subjects?</i><br>
<p>
I already said it, free decision is an illusion. <br>
I'm not talking about intelligence, but about education, a difference you seem to be <br>
unable to make. The less you know, the higher is the probability that your decision <br>
will be wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for your other insults, I am not ashamed of my opinions, if I didn't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom and justice were good things I would not lie about it, I would just</i><br>
<i>&gt; say so. You will note that I have not said so. If what you say about "all"</i><br>
<i>&gt; Libertarians is true then almost everybody on this list is an unjust freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt; hating greedy moron who lies about their motivation. Why do you even talk to</i><br>
<i>&gt; us?</i><br>
<p>
Freedom and justice are good things. The problem is that free markets make people <br>
unfree and the world unjust. The problem is further that freedom of markets is <br>
usually directly transferred to freedom of the individual. The other problem is that <br>
freedom and coercion are not clearly defined and that usually only state pressure is <br>
considered as coercion.<br>
<p>
The main problem is: Libertarians don't think enough. Like religous fanatics or <br>
fascists (NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO RELATE YOU TO THESE PEOPLE! But you will probably <br>
still tell me that I do...) they manage not to think about certain things. Barriers <br>
in the brain. You will unconsciously leave out certain parts of this message when you <br>
answer it (if you do). Parts you don't [want to] understand.<br>
<p>
And one thing I especially dislike: the tone of your answer. You grabbed one single <br>
word of my posting and included it in the subject. What I said in my original posting <br>
was: "If someone is not greedy and a Libertarian, he/she must be stupid" [meaning he <br>
doesn't know better]. But don't you always say that greed (using a different <br>
phrase like desire for self-realization or sth. similar) is perfectly OK and <br>
_everyone_ should be greedy? <br>
<p>
As for my other insults, I haven't insulted anyone anyhwere. But maybe you'd prefer <br>
if I wouldn't say directly what I think? Sorry, that's a wish I can't fulfill.<br>
<p>
