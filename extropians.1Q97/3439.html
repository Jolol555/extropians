 <br>
But the filter may well not be due solely to such events.  Colliding<br>
neutron stars, nearby supernovae, having your solar system drift through<br>
a dust cloud, having a superjovian in your system to throw comets at<br>
you... there could be a bunch of astronomical filters which we don't<br>
easily know of because they were all absent for us, by definition.<br>
<p>
I've just read Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_, in which he<br>
tries to look at the environmental factors behind Eurasian dominance.<br>
Mostly "we" had more domesticable plants and animals than any one else,<br>
on a bigger continent, oriented along a main climatic zone.  It may in<br>
the process shred L. Neil Smith's ideas about development and extreme<br>
Ayn Randism.  1000 John and Jane Galts dropped into Australia 40,000<br>
years ago would still get hosed by English convicts.<br>
<p>
But it's given me more filter ideas.  One, if developing technology can<br>
be that dependent on environment, it helps my intuition that developing<br>
intelligence might be as well, so until we learn more intelligence could<br>
well be extremely improbable.  Two, there is no guarantee a bunch of<br>
hunter-gatherers will get out of that state.  If there's a shortage of<br>
domesticable plants (flip side: if Earth/Asia was improbably blessed),<br>
or say if Africa had been a separate continent, so that the domesticable<br>
large mammals of Eurasia got wiped out before their domestication was<br>
needed, food production might never have happened, at least not in any<br>
large way.<br>
<p>
[Large animal thing: domesticated large mammals consist of 13 Eurasian<br>
animals and the llama, the dog not being counted in this size class.<br>
America and especially Australia hardly have any large mammals --<br>
possibly because their first experience with hominids was with<br>
Cro-Magnon hunters, who could have hunted them out of extinction<br>
quickly.  African and Eurasian animals had closer to a million years to<br>
evolve a fear of large bipeds.  My personal theory for why Africa lacks<br>
domesticable megafauna is that they had too much time to evolve a fear<br>
of bipeds; a few Eurasian species were still working on it, and thus<br>
weren't too vicious or panicky.  If Africa had been separate, Eurasia<br>
would also have met Cro-Magnon, not proto-hominids, and their megafauna<br>
might have gone poof.]<br>
<p>
Diamond and Sulloway may be spearheading the turning of history into<br>
science, although I'm quoting Michael Shermer of _Skeptic_ here.  I<br>
suppose _The Fourth Turning_ might be part of it as well, although I<br>
admit I'm more suspicious of what I've heard of those ideas.<br>
<p>

Sounds like Babylon-5, actually.<br>
