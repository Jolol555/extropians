Shirking?  Granted, we have yet to flesh out the transition from a statist to<br>
a polycentric legal order, but I would not assume that statists will entirely<br>
rue the change.  Rather, they may, given the proper incentives, cede power<br>
gracefully.  See the "buy outs" of ex-Soviet Communist Party members, or US<br>
Federal Judges retiring early for the more lucrative practice of ADR.<br>
 Needless to say, I regard crafting effective (if not necessarily<br>
Pareto-optimal) exits to a polycentric society as a *very* important and<br>
interesting topic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Each entity is likely still a</i><br>
<i>&gt;"state" in the sense of holding a monopoly on local "force", i.e.,</i><br>
<i>&gt;fighting professionals who patrol and are ready to respond to calls</i><br>
<i>&gt;for help.</i><br>
<p>
Careful here.  Recall that enforcement in one geographic area can come from<br>
different legal systems at different levels.  Again, the<br>
far-from-perfect-but-not-entirely-rotten US legal system provides good<br>
examples:  fed and state cops patrolling the same highways; bounty hunters<br>
crossing the country; the SPA busting software pirates everywhere--even<br>
online.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But ease of moving between entities and of creating new</i><br>
<i>&gt;such entities keeps entities competitive and hence accountable, by</i><br>
<i>&gt;switching attention from voting with "voice" to voting with "feet".</i><br>
<p>
And--importantly!--voting with money!  I may well pay more for a coop that<br>
has increased its police force.  I may well pay more for an ISP that promises<br>
me infection-free access, backed by bond.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And the change in scale switches the legal focus to law regarding</i><br>
<i>&gt;interactions between citizens of differing entities, rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;between citizens of the same entity.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe.  But some communities will undoubtedly turn inward and primarily<br>
adjudicate their own struggles.  Cf. how States currently evince different<br>
levels of interest in foreign policy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Given this picture, I see two contrary stability concerns:</i><br>
<p>
Right.  I like your framing the problem with two extrema:  the Devil and the<br>
Deep Blue Sea.<br>
