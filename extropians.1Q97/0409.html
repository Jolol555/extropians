FDA weighs merits of colloidal silver <br>
Some claim it's a miracle cure, for others it merely colors  <br>
the skin <br>
December 31, 1996 <br>
Web posted at: 5:50 p.m. EST <br>
<i>&gt;From Correspondent Linda Ciampa </i><br>
 <br>
ATLANTA (CNN) -- Rosemary Jacobs has a skin condition  <br>
called argyria. It hasn't made her sick -- but it has turned  <br>
her skin a bluish-gray. <br>
 <br>
"I've had trouble getting jobs," Jacobs says. "And it's  <br>
because people are afraid that my face is bad for business.  <br>
And they don't know what it is." <br>
 <br>
Jacobs has seen numerous doctors over the years and believes  <br>
her argyria was caused by nose drops she used as a child. The  <br>
nose drops contained a substance called colloidal silver.  <br>
 <br>
Colloidal silver was widely used for treating colds and  <br>
syphilis before World War II. Its popularity dropped as  <br>
other drugs were developed, but in the early 1990s, colloidal  <br>
silver re-emerged as a food supplement and over-the-counter  <br>
drug. <br>
 <br>
Now, the Food and Drug Administration has stepped in to force <br>
manufacturers of colloidal silver to prove claims that <br>
it can cure everything from AIDS to cancer to multiple sclerosis. <br>
 <br>
Doctors disagree <br>
 <br>
Dr. Jeff Anderson of northern California doesn't make any  <br>
outlandish claims about colloidal silver, but he does use  <br>
low doses to treat some patients with infectious diseases.  <br>
And he thinks today's colloidal products are safer because <br>
they're made with much less silver than those of years ago. <br>
 <br>
Anderson acknowledges that doses as high as those used past <br>
years "would accumulate (over a period of time) and  <br>
cause argyria." <br>
 <br>
But Dr. Man Fung, a toxicologist at the University of  <br>
Pennsylvania, says even today's low-dose silver products can   <br>
build up in the body if taken long term. He questions its  <br>
value. <br>
 <br>
"Why (would) you want to pay $50 to buy a bottle, and then  <br>
expose yourself to some potential toxicity which has no use  <br>
and will not do anything to you or for you?" he says. <br>
 <br>
Colloidal silver manufacturers which sell the product as a drug  <br>
have until the middle of January to prove their claims to the  <br>
FDA. Until the FDA makes a recommendation, consumers must  <br>
decide whether colloidal silver is helpful or not.  <br>

Davin's Note: <br>
&lt;&lt;Colloidal silver manufacturers which sell the product as a drug  <br>
have until the middle of January to prove their claims to the  <br>
FDA. Until the FDA makes a recommendation, consumers must  <br>
decide whether colloidal silver is helpful or not. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
This is nothing new or sensational.  FDA always expects this proof if the<br>
product is sold as a "drug."  Nutritional Supplements are not drugs but they<br>
can be mislabeled with _drug_claims_ ,  a "no-no."  I do not interpret this<br>
as an FDA ban in mid January. <br>
