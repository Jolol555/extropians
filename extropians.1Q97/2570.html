So sources of the disturbances in the economic progress are:<br>
political upheavals, wars, and financial crises. I'dd add<br>
natural catastrophes and environmental crises as reasons for<br>
some of the above.<br>
<p>
Many of these - or most -  are caused by reasons that have little<br>
to do with a market economy.<br>
<p>
U.S. today seems naturally shielded from some of them - at this<br>
point, it is not likely to start a big war, or be attacked; the<br>
size of the economy gives an insurance against most natural<br>
catastrophes, that could devastate a little country; environment<br>
seems pretty safe at this point as well.<br>
<p>
I would not rule out a possibility of political or financial crises<br>
though - and *some* probability of wars, epidemics or huge natural<br>
catastrophes.<br>
<p>
I recently listened to a speech of an investment salesman projecting<br>
the 401(K) profits for my colleagues based on the previous performance<br>
of the market.  In all such calculations, it is assumed that the string<br>
of luck will continue indefinitely, U.S. government will exist forever,<br>
and the probability of any disruptions is exactly equal to 0.<br>
This creates a comfortable feeling of (false) security that leads many<br>
people in their 20s to take money away from travel, health or education,<br>
and entrust it to the big financial institutions.<br>
<p>
On another note, I feel quite suspicious about all these statistics.<br>
They do not take into account any new products and structural changes<br>
and economic and social novelty.<br>
<p>
The 5% growth is in oil, cars, and pork bellies in some constant prices.<br>
The fact that people can now use less oil to accomplish the same things<br>
(like sending messages), use safer cars and food, and enjoy new services<br>
and products that just did not exist a few years earlier, is not accounted<br>
in the economic statistics.  Neither does quality of the environment, level<br>
of public education, etc.<br>
<p>
My personal quality of life increased immeasurably in the last several<br>
years, with the development of the Internet, and my understanding of it.<br>
<p>
I have yet to see an indicator of progress that would take it into account.<br>
The statistics show the quantity of resources spent by the economy - the<br>
amount of oil burned, number of letters delivered, new office space<br>
constructed, counseling services provided, etc. It does not measure the<br>
quality of the results - the utility of information received, efficiency<br>
of offices, health and wisdom of the population, stability of social<br>
structures, etc.  When the same ends can be satisfied with new, better,<br>
and cheaper technologies, all traditional quantitative indicators can<br>
plunge, while the results may dramatically improve.<br>
<p>
There may be methods allowing to reduce qualitative progress to quantitative<br>
measures.  For example, I can ask myself whether I would sacrifice my Net<br>
access to add $100K to the value of my house.  Well, I wouldn't.<br>
