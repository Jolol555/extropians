Being a capitalist does not neccesarily mean that one favors being a <br>
greedy bastard.  It means that one favors an economic/political system <br>
in which being a greedy bastard is /profitable/.<br>
<p>
Capitalism is an ideal system for many of us who do have more <br>
important things to do in life than become rich.  It ( ideally ) allows<br>
us to spend the minimum ammount of time money-grubbing and the<br>
maximum doing more important things like like making love or dropping<br>
acid.<br>
 <br>

<i>&gt; "Extropians" are, in fact, "altruists preaching selfishness", and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is indeed somewhat disturbing that comparitively many do not</i><br>

<p>
Selfishness is not measured in dollars.<br>
