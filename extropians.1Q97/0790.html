Nonetheless, any significant moon occupation would bring up sovereignty<br>
issues.  A private multi-national corporation would not have any particular<br>
obligation to a country, and for any serious development *someone* will have<br>
to take control.  The UN can't govern it, because the UN is not capable of<br>
behaving as a sovereign government in its current form.  Not to mention they<br>
couldn't find their way out of a paper bag, let alone run a country.  It<br>
would be difficult for any country to press rights when 1) they have no<br>
presence on the moon, and 2) they don't have any historical claim to that<br>
particular piece of real estate. <br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ah, would these stockholders still be on Earth?  If so, I hope I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to expand on the flaws in this scenario.  Even if not, the colony</i><br>
<i>&gt;might not be independent of further immigration, which Earth could cut</i><br>
<i>&gt;off.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;} benfits from, their ability to multiply greater rates of capital growth</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Economics would probably be the driving factor in all this.  If the lunar<br>
colony can produce critical materials and technologies (such as advanced,<br>
cheap alloys) at lunar pennies on the earth dollar, then there will be<br>
little the earth can do to stop *everyone* from trading with the lunar<br>
colony.  It would simply be to profitable to not trade with the lunar<br>
colony.  As has happened historically, economics will drive government<br>
policy and world action.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Without an influx of skilled people, perhaps not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Again, I'm not saying there aren't scenarios where a young colony can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;break away.  In some scenarios they might be let go without pain.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;just don't see that the gravity well is a super-ace that lets Luna off</i><br>
<i>&gt;under any conditions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another variation: Luna declares independence.  Earth protests formally</i><br>
<i>&gt;and harasses any ground connection but otherwise does not attack.  Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt;then heavily invests in getting a government presence in space, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;can compete directly with Mikeycorp or turn against you later, "bringing</i><br>
<i>&gt;the deviants back into the fold."  An attempt to maintain your monopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt;in space before the gov't grows strong there then justifies a</i><br>
<i>&gt;destructive attack against you.</i><br>
<p>
Any government attempts at trying to catch up and eventually take over would<br>
have to be done at the early stages of lunar development, and would be<br>
extremely expensive for the government in any event.  A well developed Luna<br>
would be almost impossible to recover.  Toothpaste out of the tube...<br>
