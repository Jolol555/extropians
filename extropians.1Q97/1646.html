<i> &gt;Eric Watt Forste asks:</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; What is an "intrinsic value system"?</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Pister found a way to put the concept of intrinsic value across clearly. To</i><br>
<i> &gt;the question What good is it?, he replied, What good are you? </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;"That answer forces the questioner to confront the fact that he or she</i><br>
<i> &gt;regards his or her own total value to exceed his or her instrumental value.</i><br>
<i> &gt;Many people hope to be instrumentally valuable -- to be useful to family,</i><br>
<i> &gt;friends, and society. But if we prove to be good for nothing, we believe,</i><br>
<i> &gt;nevertheless, that we are still entitled to life, to liberty, to the</i><br>
<i> &gt;pursuit of happiness. (If only instrumentally valuable people enjoyed a</i><br>
<i> &gt;claim to live, the world might not be afflicted with human overpopulation</i><br>
<i> &gt;and overconsumption; certainly we would have no need for expensive</i><br>
<i> &gt;hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and the like.) Human dignity and the</i><br>
<i> &gt;respect it commands -- human ethical entitlement -- is grounded ultimately</i><br>
<i> &gt;in our claim to possess intrinsic value. "</i><br>
<p>
Okay. You're talking Kantian ethics. I can understand that. But<br>
how will "intrinsic value systems" "free" us from money? We've had<br>
intrinsic value systems since the European Enlightenment at least.<br>
Either that, or you haven't really told me what you mean by "intrinsic<br>
value systems".<br>
<p>
The modern version of the core of ethical Kantianism (without all<br>
that silly "intentions matter more than results" garbage) is a<br>
division of the ethical world into persons and nonpersons, with<br>
persons being defined as the locus of intrinsic value. What this<br>
has to do with money, I have no idea. Nonetheless, it's very<br>
interesting, because we used to have a nice simple hack of a<br>
distinction between persons and nonpersons: the boundaries of the<br>
species Homo sapiens. Nowadays, the distinction is growing less<br>
clear all the time, which is a matter that Kantian moral philosophers<br>
are simply going to have to deal with whether they like it or not<br>
(at least, if they want to remain Kantian moral philosophers).<br>
<p>
The discussion of Pister that you quote above also fails to<br>
distinguish between valuers, treating "value" as something that is<br>
independent of the valuer, rather than a relation between the valuer<br>
and the valued. Thus the discussion confuses the individual's<br>
"instrumental" value (value to *other* people) with the individual's<br>
"intrinsic" value (value to oneself) as if these were similar,<br>
comparable, or summable things. I suspect that these things are<br>
distinct, and that to collapse them together in this manner leads<br>
to confusion. This is pretty common in moral philosophy, though:<br>
people start out assuming that an impartial ethical system is<br>
preferable to a partial ethical system, and then use that assumption<br>
to *prove* (heh heh) that an impartial ethical system is preferable<br>
to a partial ethical system. Here, the assumption is sneaked in by<br>
failing to distinguish between other people's value for oneself<br>
and one's own value for oneself. As if one's "absolute value" was<br>
a sum of these two fundamentally different things.<br>
<p>
I tend to use an impartial ethical system (when I'm not just going<br>
by hunch, which is what I do most of the time, but that's just me)<br>
because I'm a shameless opportunist, and impartial ethics presents<br>
me with more opportunities for positive-sum games. So does money, for<br>
that matter.<br>
