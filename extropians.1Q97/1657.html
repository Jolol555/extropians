<i>&gt;So, apologies, but playing petty mindgames at meetings seems to me totally</i><br>
<i>&gt;entropic behavoir. And I'm sure it goes on all the time. Sometimes I wish</i><br>
<i>&gt;I had the time to waste.</i><br>
<p>
That isn't it at all, and I'm sorry you interpreted it that way.  I'm <br>
talking about the basic situation most profession women encounter <br>
when they take a position of leadership, if they happen to be young <br>
and attractive.  You enter a room and literally no one makes eye <br>
contact with you because they think you're the secretary or an <br>
assistant.  I don't apologize for gently pulling the rug out from <br>
under that assumption--half of business is power games anyway.  Most of<br>
them do adjust, and guess what--the older men tend to deal with it better, <br>
because they are less easily threatened.<br>

Sin,<br>
