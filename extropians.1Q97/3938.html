I think the most important thing we need to realize is that everyone<br>
need not be recruited. Widespread recruitment is not necessary, if an<br>
extropian future is to be defined by technological change. In such a<br>
societal trend, they all eventually "will be assimilated".<br>
<p>
What I think we need to focus on instead is knowing what we know, we<br>
should make our own plans to maximize the benefits of our knowledge of<br>
the probable future to ourselves. Start Picking extropic stocks, work in<br>
extropic jobs, band together and form extropic corporations. <br>
<p>
 One area where I think we can be effective in our evangelizing is to<br>
first publish a "Megatrends"-like book that fits in  with the<br>
self-improvement/empowerment movement. Rather than depending on us as<br>
individuals (who on average, are not typically charismatic), use this<br>
tome to run extropian based retreats and self-help seminars. Yeah, some<br>
are turned off by this idea, but hey, if it didn't work, people wouldnt<br>
be making millions off of it already, would they? The sort of people<br>
that are already into this sort of thing tend to, in my estimation, be<br>
dynamically optimistic people, so the existing industry is fertile<br>
ground for early assimilation.<br>
<p>
If anyone does decide to personally recruit people, get into the habit<br>
of doing a mental pre-screen on people. Develop a list of conversation<br>
topics to delve into people's opinions about things like life extension,<br>
cloning, intelligence amplification, the internet, space development,<br>
etc. Be patient. It does not matter if it takes you a few months of<br>
preliminary screening conversations with individuals to ascertain their<br>
views, maybe even change a few of their ideas that they seem pliable on.<br>
Only once they seem to fit the profile of "undiscovered transhumanist"<br>
should you get really descriptive of us as a movement. If you can, don't<br>
even let on about us until you've determined that they are ready to<br>
accept the term "transhumanist" as describing themselves.<br>
