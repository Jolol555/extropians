<i>&gt; I have to disagree.  Grades and degrees reflect that you did the work</i><br>
<i>&gt; expected of you.  They do not reflect that you learned anything.  This may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a fault of the system more than anything, but I don't think grades or</i><br>
<i>&gt; degrees reflect knowledge.  I know many people who have degrees in technical</i><br>
<i>&gt; fields who are unqualified by any other standard.  I have gotten mediocre</i><br>
<i>&gt; grades in classes because I didn't do any of the homework, even though I got</i><br>
<i>&gt; A's on all the exams and was possibly more qualified than the teacher. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Schools are ineffective because they don't reward learning.  They reward work.</i><br>
<p>
Schools are ineffective due to a short-circuit:  Simple presence in<br>
class is taken as evidence of learning.  Schools are being paid for<br>
degrees and the other proofs-of-learning that are required on the<br>
resume.  They are not being paid for actual LEARNING or job skills, per<br>
se.<br>
<p>
To fix this problem, change the line required on the resume from:<br>
"Springfield School of Psychiatry and Pinball-Machine Repair:  M.D."<br>
to<br>
"National Institute of Cognitive Sciences Verificiation: <br>
Professional-level skills: psychopharmocology (98.3%), neurology<br>
(99.2%), and psychoanalysis (94.4%)."<br>
<p>
Note that the latter line is an Institute of Verification; you don't<br>
actually go there to learn, you go there to *have your learning<br>
verified*.  If you haven't learned enough in school, you fail.  Since<br>
verification is much less time-consuming than education, I of Vs can<br>
devote much more time and detail to the process, serve much larger<br>
populations, and present far more valuable information to employers.<br>
<p>
Stop the short circuit between education and verification, cheating<br>
employers and students alike!<br>
