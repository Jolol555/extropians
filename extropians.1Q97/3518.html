By way of addendum to my earlier biography of Hypatia:<br>
<p>
An article in today's paper indicates that, according to letters <br>
written by students of Hypatia, she invented several scientific <br>
instruments, including an astrolabe, a water distiller, and a <br>
hydrometer.<br>
<p>
Also, according to three recent books on women inventors, it seems <br>
that the Countess of Lovelace (1812-1852) is more authoritatively being <br>
credited with inventing the first binary computer programming language.<br>
Because she wrote it for a computer invented by her husband Charles <br>
Babbage, and because of the laws of that time, all of her work would <br>
have been owned by her husband, and this led to some confusion as to <br>
the extent of her role.  <br>
<p>
The National Women's History Project has set up a web site with links <br>
to info about female technologists at <a href="http://www.whp.org">http://www.whp.org</a><br>
