<p>
Since Science mags online site doesn't have the full text of issues from<br>
1983, I had to go to my local universities micro-film stash. I found 2 articles<br>
by Gallo from the same issue in 1983 [Gallo, R.C., P.S. Sarin, E.P.<br>
Gelmann, M. Robert-Guroff, and E. Richardson.  Isolation of human<br>
T-cell leukemia virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).<br>
Science 220 (1983): 865-867; and another article immediately adjacent to<br>
that one called "Proviral DNA of a retrovirus, Human T-cell Leukemia<br>
Virus, in 2 patients with AIDS"].  Here is Gallo's [et al.'s] own words:<br>
<p>
"We have been testing the hypothesis that AIDS is caused by a human<br>
retrovirus.."<br>
<p>
"that the viral genome of HTLV was found to be integrated into peripheral<br>
blood lymphocyte DNA in 2 of 33 AIDS patients tested thus far may<br>
reflect an etiologic association..."<br>
<p>
"Since HTLV is endemic in southern Japan, the apparent lack of epidemic<br>
AIDS in this region may argue against a causative role for HTLV in AIDS.<br>
However...people in southern Japan may have a greater resistance to<br>
the T-cell suppressive effect of the virus."<br>
<p>
"Since HTLV is a T-cell tropic virus it can be linked hypothetically to other<br>
human T-cell disorders." <br>
<p>
"Since HTLV can also infect marmoset and other primate T-cells, should<br>
this virus be established as the causative agent of AIDS, it may also be<br>
possible to develop an animal model of the disease."<br>
<p>
"Our results, if they do reflect an etiologic role for HTLV in AIDS, suggest<br>
a possible mechanism of disease induction."<br>
<p>
I submit a fair reading of the evidence from the horses own mouth suggest<br>
that Gallo was arguing that HTLV-I causes AIDS in 1983.  Others concur.<br>
<p>
"In 1982, Robert Gallo from the National Cancer Institute in the USA, put<br>
forward the hypothesis that the cause of AIDS is a retrovirus. One year<br>
later, Myron Essex and his colleagues found that AIDS patients had<br>
antibodies to the Human T-cell Leukemia virus Type-1 (HTLV-I), a virus<br>
discovered by Gallo a few years earlier. At the same time, Gallo and his<br>
colleagues reported the isolation of HTLV-I from AIDS patients and <br>
advocated a role for this retrovirus in the pathogenesis of AIDS."<br>
[Papadopulos-Eleopulos, E., V.F. Turner, J.M. Papadimitriou, Has Gallo<br>
proven the role of HIV in AIDS? Emergency Medicine 1993; 5:5-147.]<br>
