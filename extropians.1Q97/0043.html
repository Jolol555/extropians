<i>&gt; Good point.  I think that libertarians tend to conflate the concepts</i><br>

<i>&gt; However, that destroying the property of others without a prior threat</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not coercive makes it no more acceptable.</i><br>
<p>
yet, if biological warfare on your property without your authorization<br>
can constitute a "taking" which can affect the value of your property.<br>
You obviously could never sell the property to people concerned about<br>
such toxic pollution (however misplaced the fear). Back in the 19th<br>
century, when the industrial revolution was taking root in northeastern<br>
cities, farmers would complain about the soot that would precipitate<br>
onto their crops, and some sued, claiming an unconstitutional "taking".<br>
The court at that time ruled that while the pollution damage WAS a<br>
taking, the positive economic benefits of industrialization outweighed<br>
the damage incurred.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;coercive force of the current War on Drugs - "stop selling or we'll blow</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;your head off."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Certainly if anybody found out that you had destroyed their coca crop,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they would blow _your_ head off, and the law, technology, and all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumans in the world wouldn't be able to save you.  (And if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't get you, the CIA would :-) ).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It occurred to me that the US isn't waging a War on Drugs -- it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; waging a Vietnam on Drugs.  No wonder they're not winning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Lets hope they abandon it like they did Vietnam!!!!!<br>
