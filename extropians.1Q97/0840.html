That's a very interesting question, actually.  The first time I ever asked <br>
myself that question, "Who am I really, deep down?" I got a very unexpected <br>
answer from myself.  In a very authoritative tone, I answered my question <br>
internally, "You are nothing but a scared child."  I won't go into detail <br>
here, but a few minutes after that, I realized profoundly that my whole belief <br>
system and my plans for my life were simply adopted from other people and that <br>
I didn't really believe in them myself and didn't really want to go through <br>
with what was expected of my in life.  Then a couple seconds after that I felt <br>
totally disscociated with that entire belief system and ego structure, and I <br>
haven't recovered since.  Nothing meant anything to me any more, everything <br>
that had any emotional significance to me was meaningless; my family meant <br>
little more than the bushes outside meant to me.  I had no idea what I wanted <br>
to do or why, and over the course of the next few months I became suicidally <br>
depressed and pretty much insane and delusional.  So, that is the question <br>
that blew my mind.  The gate to insanity...<br>
<p>
That was about four years ago.  It was kind of like my personality was <br>
cleared, and I had to create a new one.  My life had lost all meaning, and I <br>
had to create something meaningful to live for.  My old myths had lost all <br>
their appeal, and I had to create new myths for myself and step into them and <br>
play them out.  Only a heroic role would do for me; it had to be something <br>
wildly ambitious, yet something I felt I could do.  Something so big and <br>
dramatic that it would be endlessly entertaining to me.  <br>
<p>
So that's what I've been working on for the past three years or so, and I've <br>
been having a great time.  The mental disciplines I'm developing are very <br>
central to my hero role.  I've got to turn myself into an incredibly brilliant <br>
genius if I'm even going to be able to pull of half the stuff I'm planning to <br>
do.  My goal is to become an Ace of All Trades; to excell at everything.  And <br>
to assist others who wish to do the same.  And, using the skills and knowledge <br>
I develop over the coming years, I wish to work with many others to transform <br>
the quality of nearly all areas of human endeavor, to help raise the standards <br>
of excellence in all fields.<br>
<p>
I look at humanity, and I see, as many see, that we are changing quite <br>
dramatically during this period of time.  I understand the nature of the <br>
change; we are becoming more intelligent, creative, more free and expressive, <br>
and I feel very strongly that this change is a Good Thing.  I want to be a <br>
part of this change, a big part of it.  I want to be among the first to embody <br>
the values that I believe will be mainstream in the coming years and to set an <br>
example to other humans, showing them what we are capable of.  I believe the <br>
future will be excellent.  And I want to do my best to make it even more so.<br>
<p>
But what's really amazing to me is how powerfully a myth like the one I've <br>
created for myself can really take over one's life.  It's like, everything I <br>
do is within the framework of this myth I've created.  I want to excell at <br>
everything, and I'm so driven to improve my skills and deepen my knowledge of <br>
everything.  My mind has becoming so very attentive, hungrily studying every <br>
minute detail, looking for useful information and trying to understand <br>
everything better.  It's like my whole mind is becoming based on these ideas <br>
of excellence and continual improvement; I'm just getting so sucked into my <br>
own myth and becoming the hero of it.<br>
<p>
It's just weird, because I can remember when I didn't have that myth, and I <br>
can trace its development in my mind over the past few years.  Sure, I had <br>
bits and pieces of the myth in my mind all my life, but it's only really come <br>
together so coherently over the past few years.  I can see how I've made it <br>
grow stronger and more expansive and inclusive and more *addictive*.  I just <br>
keep playing around with my belief systems and refining them, and they just <br>
become so beautiful and irresistable to me!<br>
<p>
So, who is David, REALLY?  I don't have a fucking clue.  I'm just sort of <br>
making it up as I go along.  I figure, that since I don't know who the hell I <br>
am or what the hell I'm doing here, I might as well make the most of it.  I'm <br>
going to play the role I most want to play and live the life I most want to <br>
live.  I guess I got kinda tired of being miserable...<br>
