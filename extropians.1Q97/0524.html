<i>&gt; &gt;This would be transhumanist art would it not?</i><br>
<p>
Has anyone seen the incredible interactive graphics now accessible to the<br>
public via the Nintendo 64 game system? It assures me that at least VR<br>
isn't far off at all. I especially want to experience the sunkenship level<br>
firsthand as an uploaded being. Anyone else seen the system or perhaps know<br>
what SGI processor it runs? To picture the sunkenship level, imagine being<br>
surrounded by jagged grey mountains with a blue lake before you. You enter<br>
the water and the music becomes more detailed and complex yet soothing. You<br>
swim through the shallow area until it drops off into a deep blue abyss and<br>
resting on the bottom is a sunken ship. A huge eel swims around the ship.<br>
You swim to the seafloor and look up to see the jagged peaks of the grey<br>
mountains through the surface of the water. There are fish swimming around<br>
that quickly dart away when you near them. This may be all a video game but<br>
it is definitely a piece of art. What a piece of eyecandy! They did a<br>
beautiful job in creating this landscape. It takes a little bit getting<br>
used to the swimming controls (point in the direction you want to go and<br>
kick your legs repeatedly) but I definitely recommend going down to your<br>
local Best Buy or general electronics store to try it out for yourself.<br>
This is the uploaded world I want to live in!<br>
