Haven't you seen Unix giving up ground in favour of NT? That's a real <br>
threat. The lemmings are on the move, towards a yet another monopoly. Well.<br>

Multithreaded flavours of Unix do exist, see Mach. SMP version of<br>

That's property of the file system, not of the OS. I don't see why we<br>
at all need file systems, when virtual memory, persistant objects and<br>
garbage collection would do perfectly.<br>

NFS is slow, but it works. A faster version has been released recently, <br>
afaik.<br>

It wasn't free during most of the time, desastrous marketing being <br>
part of why it ain't widespread yet (and never will, but I never liked<br>
mainstream things).<br>
