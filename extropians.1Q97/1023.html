That's not always the case.  Many rational people are open to rational<br>
criticism, but remain closed to emotional or unsupported propositions. <br>
That closes rationalism off from non-rational criticism, making it<br>
effectively dogma.<br>
<p>
To try and remain open-minded, one can adopt a pancritical rationalism,<br>
(take a look at <a href="http://www.c2.org/~exi/pcr.htm">http://www.c2.org/~exi/pcr.htm</a> ), but that system can<br>
only take us so far.  There are important questions which pancritical<br>
rationalism leaves unanswered.  Most notably, pancritical rationalism<br>
leaves quite a bit of room for religion to thrive, so long as the<br>
religion's concept of spirituality is internally consistent. <br>
Nonetheless, it's an important start.<br>
