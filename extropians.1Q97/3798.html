<p>
Ok, by that same logic.  If I were to write a book and publish it on the<br>
open market.  Why shouldn't folks be able to copy it and sell it as<br>
there own with the resulting royalties? After all, its on the open<br>
market.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;     Not having a system of protections for these future oriented people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would give the lazy and oportunistic the right to benefit from the work</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of others - not a very libertarian concept.  Besides, patents expire</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (voila IBM clones) giving others the right to benefit from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; advancement, but also giving the individual(s) their just rewards.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree that "a system" should do that.  I just disagree that it should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be government force.  Private contracts and private technologies work.</i><br>
<p>
I'm as big a fan of the freedom to contract as anyone. Here's a hypo for<br>
you.  If I were to create, say a new type of hard disk that stored 1000X<br>
the information of the current industry standard.  How would i be able<br>
to prevent every other manufacturer from benefiting from my R&amp;D in the<br>
absence of a patent?<br>
