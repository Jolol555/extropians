<i> &gt;P.S. Where'd the political system, Bill Clinton, and my state</i><br>

<i> &gt;federal judges get their destructive social engineering ideas from?</i><br>
<i> &gt;Three guesses...</i><br>
<p>
1. The Sermon on the Mount<br>
2. Maynard Keynes<br>
3. busybody do-gooder bored wealthy American political activists, whose<br>
   heads seem perfectly capable of generating lots of random destructive<br>
   social engineering ideas all on their own<br>
<p>
I don't see any French guys on that list, Reilly. I could name a<br>
whole bunch more sources, too. If I were to generalize about it,<br>
I'd have to go along with Hayek that the "intellectual current"<br>
responsible for our sorry political situation is<br>
constructivist-rationalism, the idea that authorities can be trusted<br>
to run society, that individuals are required to figure out what<br>
other people are supposed to do. Not only is that a very old and<br>
pervasive intellectual current, but it also happens to be one that<br>
I think many of the current French poststructuralists are fairly<br>
careful to eschew.<br>
<p>
But we need to keep in mind that all such attempts to trace<br>
intellectual currents in history and pin responsibility on them<br>
are examples of collectivist thinking, and that collectivist thinking<br>
is often misleading. If you are a lover of liberty, you believe in<br>
free speech, and it seems strange to me for a believer in free<br>
speech to blame the wielder of the pen and not the wielder of the<br>
sword. Especially when you are such an active pen-wielder yourself.<br>
<p>
And finally, it's my opinion that the current crop of French<br>
poststructuralists are neither very original nor very interesting.<br>
The best of them are just riffing off of Nietzsche, so you might<br>
as well blame him. But that's been done to death, which is, I guess,<br>
the reason why you've moved on to abusing the French.<br>
