From: "David Musick" &lt;David_Musick@msn.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;Michael Bowling said, "I say self awareness in any being presupposes and </i><br>
<i>&gt;necessitates legal rights and protection.".</i><br>
<p>
I missed the quoted posting, but I would approach this question from a<br>
different angle.  Asking for legal protection of the rights of some entity<br>
is basically requiring that other people agree with your belief that<br>
it deserves those rights.  Rather than take the jump of demanding that<br>
other people agree with me, I prefer to first focus on my own actions.<br>
<p>
What systems will I choose to treat as though they have rights?  I find<br>
this is a hard question to answer, so I will hesitate to demand that<br>
other people draw the line in the same place that I do.  It is still<br>
useful to debate the question because the insights that other people<br>
provide will help me to understand the issues better.<br>
<p>
Moving away from the question of legal rights also removes the element<br>
of threat from the discussion.  I am no longer proposing to force others<br>
to follow my views, I am simply debating some issues of philosophy.<br>
This should facilitate an honest and discussion and remove some elements<br>
of emotion.<br>
<p>
David continues:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What do you mean by "self awareness"?  What are your criteria for "self </i><br>
<i>&gt;awareness"?  Is a dog self aware?  Why or why not?  Are plants self aware?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Why or why not?  As you're thinking about this, are you deliberately arranging </i><br>
<i>&gt;the definition of "self awareness" so that it applies only to humans?  </i><br>
<p>
I believe that dogs are self aware but plants are not.  I do not hesitate<br>
to cut down trees or mow the lawn, but I would not chop a dog in two<br>
without a very good reason.  I don't consider insects to be self aware so<br>
I freely kill ants and spiders.  Fish are borderline for me; I have caught<br>
fish for sport since I was a boy, but in recent years I have had trouble<br>
convincing myself that it feels no pain from the hook and the capture.<br>
I don't fish much any more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One could argue that a plant is self aware, because it adjusts its internal </i><br>
<i>&gt;functioning according to it's needs, so the plant is aware of itself (it's </i><br>
<i>&gt;needs) to some extent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does "awareness" mean 'responding to stimulii'?  If so, then "self awareness" </i><br>
<i>&gt;would seem to mean 'responding to self generated stimulii'.  This definition </i><br>
<i>&gt;of "self-awareness" would cover many, many types of organisms.  Should these </i><br>
<i>&gt;organisms receive legal protection?</i><br>
<p>
Actually I think the term "self aware" is somewhat redundant for my<br>
purpose.  What I am really interested in is awareness, which I use as a<br>
synonym for consciousness.  It's not clear whether something could have<br>
conscious awareness without being aware of itself.  If it did, I'm not<br>
sure how I should act towards it.  Perhaps killing it is OK since it<br>
would presumably not directly perceive the action, since it is not aware<br>
of itself.  On the other hand, that would terminate its consciousness.<br>
<p>
Of course, I don't know with certainty that plants have no conscious.  But<br>
I base my judgement on the observation that in humans, brains are necessary<br>
for consciousness, and damage to the brain generally causes damage to the<br>
consciousness.  Plants have no brains or brain-like organs, as far as I<br>
know, so I assume that they are unconscious.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why should legal protection be based on how *conscious* a system is?  Why not </i><br>
<i>&gt;on how beautiful a system is or on how much it weighs or some other property? </i><br>
<i>&gt;(Typically, it's based on how similar the system is to those granting legal </i><br>
<i>&gt;protection.) If a conscious or even sentient system is unable to defend itself </i><br>
<i>&gt;from injury or destruction, do other conscious systems have an *obligation* to </i><br>
<i>&gt;protect it if they are able to?  Why or why not?</i><br>
<p>
Here is where the issue of legal rights is clouding the issue.  Let me<br>
restate David's question and ask, why do I choose to base my recognition<br>
of the rights of beings on whether they are conscious, versus whether they<br>
are beautiful?<br>
<p>
I don't agree with David's parenthetical suggestion that it is because this<br>
is an element of similarity between myself and the other.  I have many, many<br>
attributes beyond consciousness!  This explanation fails to suggest in any<br>
way why I focus on this one small aspect of myself.  Why would I not suggest<br>
that I will only recognize the rights of beings with arms, or with brown<br>
hair, or the ability to make music, or any of the myriad other attributes<br>
which I possess?<br>
<p>
The reason I focus on consciousness is because I believe that it<br>
is a prerequisite for a being to care what happens to it.  Only with<br>
consciousness can a being suffer pain or feel emotions.  Conscious beings<br>
are the only ones that I can try to imagine what it would be like to<br>
be that entity.  I really can't imagine what it would be like to be a<br>
rock, or a plant.  I picture myself solid, hard, sitting on a mountain<br>
slope, or greenly growing, my roots sucking moisture from the earth while<br>
my leaves take energy from the sun.  But I see these as ultimately just<br>
fantasies.<br>
<p>
If I imagine if I am a puppy, playing roughly with my litter-mates,<br>
running to the protection of my mother, that is an image which I view<br>
as having a kernel of truth in that the puppy really does have feelings<br>
analogous to what I have described, even though I can't really know<br>
what it is like to be him.  But this is enough for me to treat the puppy<br>
differently than the rock or plant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;These issues are important to think about.  Providing legal protection can be </i><br>
<i>&gt;very costly, and we should carefully consider our stand on when it should or </i><br>
<i>&gt;should not be provided.  Do we prosecute someone for killing a tree because we </i><br>
<i>&gt;believe the tree was "self aware" and deserved our protection?  How about an </i><br>
<i>&gt;animal, such as a dog or a cat?  How about a human fetus?  How about an infant </i><br>
<i>&gt;or a child?  Or an adult human?  How about a very advanced AI?</i><br>
<p>
Even avoiding the questions of legality, I view these issues as important.<br>
Especially as we approach an era where we may be able to create advanced<br>
AI's, we will all have to decide how to act towards them, as in the recent<br>
thread about very smart video game opponents.<br>
