BTW, if your mass-driver is set up for construction in space you'll<br>
probably be sending your rocks to L2, behind the moon (this was, AFAIR,<br>
the original 'High Frontier' plan). So you'll have another problem with<br>
getting them towards Earth. <br>

<p>
If the lunies threaten to attack Earth, then you can guarantee that the<br>
Earth governments will react. Anyway, we all know that a short war is good<br>
for your ratings; Bush proved that in the Gulf and Margaret Thatcher<br>
improved her position substantially after the Falklands War, which<br>
resulted in a much larger loss of men and machinery. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You were projecting the use of a propulsin system so efficient that it</i><br>

<p>
No, he's assuming 11km/s from Earth orbit, AFAIR. That's not terribly <br>
realistic, but possible in a future where you can afford to run a lunar <br>
colony.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And an easily detectable military mobilization in orbit will be seen to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be as much of a threat by any non allied nations on earth,</i><br>
<p>
Like the UN-sponsored buildup in the Gulf? Yes, the locals didn't like it,<br>
but they put up with it for long enough to retake Kuwait. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In addition, the logistical</i><br>
<i>&gt; costs of putting earth resources in orbit (since they won't be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get them from the moon) add additional expense to such an endeavor.</i><br>
<p>
Even today, putting a few nukes and boosters in orbit will only cost you a<br>
billion or two. In a future where you can support a million people on the<br>
moon that will probably be more like millions. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; You don't really understand the magnitude of what you are saying. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; took $60 billion in equipment losses and expenses operating a trillion</i><br>
<i>&gt; dollars in equipment with the cooperation of over a dozen nations to</i><br>
<i>&gt; mount a successful 8 day campaign here ON EARTH to recover 100 square</i><br>
<i>&gt; miles of desert wasteland.</i><br>
<p>
Note *recover*... we don't care about recovering your colony, we just<br>
disable or destroy it and tidy up afterwards. Also, of course, a few nukes<br>
dropped on Iraq and Kuwait would have ended the war quickly, probably for<br>
less than a billion dollars (unless you lost some stealth bombers in the<br>
process). The US chose to do things the expensive way for PR purposes. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; There is a HUGE differential in the costs that a defender must incur vs </i><br>
<i>&gt; the attacker to win a confrontation. Here on earth the differential can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be as much as 1 to 100.</i><br>
<p>
We don't care, because all the attacks on the moon are by machines, and <br>
we can move people out of the cities if you begin to retaliate. You'll <br>
suffer much larger casualties because you can't move.<br>
