My statement was just about patroling, not all the other law functions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;At any rate, to the extent that law enforcement *does* enjoy economies of</i><br>

<i>&gt;(I'm assuming consent-based jurisdiction, with freedom of entry and exit,</i><br>

<p>
It depends for me on just how bad things would get without such<br>
metalaws.  I really do think we need a story about why Russian<br>
protection agencies for example seem to form local territorial monopolies.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;With regard to currently recognized co-equal legal jurisdictions, we look to</i><br>
<i>&gt;international law to settle such problems.  International law's customs and</i><br>
<i>&gt;agreements essentially constitute default rules and contracts, respectively,</i><br>
<i>&gt;for relations between sovereign legal systems.  The system does not work</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfectly, of course, but it works well enough to let little States such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;Andorra face off with big ones like France.  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; As theorists in the field have often noted, international law thrives in</i><br>
<i>&gt;"structural anarchy"; in other words, no one enforcement mechanism holds</i><br>
<i>&gt;sway, yet countries do not continually war.</i><br>
<p>
But International law deals primarily among local terrorial<br>
monopolies.  I don't claim local PPLs would war with each other.  My<br>
worry is that having many PPLs in the same local territory is<br>
unstable.  Recognizing this fact, PPLs may quickly move to local<br>
monopolies without firing a shot.  Competition would the be limited by<br>
the costs to move from one area to another.  If these areas are small<br>
enough, that could be a great improvement over our status quo, but<br>
still different from the full PPL concept.<br>
