Never could be entirely, but it will probably be possible to make the<br>
subjective more objective by degree without ever reaching true<br>
objectivity. You could at least get a better sense of what it would be<br>
like to be Hal. I think we slightly attune in this fashion everyday when<br>
we attempt to communicate. In order to understand what another person is<br>
attempting to express to us we have to momentarily try to empathetically<br>
become like them in order to understand what they are saying as closely<br>
as possible to the way that they understand it. When communicating<br>
mathematics of course their is less empathy required than when we are<br>
talking about a person's piece of artwork. The more subjective the<br>
matter, the more empathy or attunement required.<br>
<p>
The more we have in common, the more we can communicate.<br>

I'm not sure, but I don't think Hal meant experiencing the entirety of<br>
the other person's consciousness. I think he may have meant to<br>
experience another person's consciousness in the fashion of<br>
communication, which again only requires a small degree of attunement. I<br>
am pretty certain that the enabling technology for this sort of<br>
interaction does not lie to far off in the future. It will be particular<br>
interesting to me, because it should allow for a much more dynamic and<br>
somewhat less subjective expression of emotions.<br>
