In a message dated 97-01-08 07:50:15 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Have you gone into a "hacker trance" or "email trance"? It sometimes<br>
 happens to me as I use a computer: everything that is outside the virtual<br>
 desktop fades away, and the world becomes information. I don't think about<br>
 my chair, how I write on the keyboard or move the mouse, I just exist as a<br>
 disembodied consciousness influencing the digital world by will alone.<br>
 This is the kind of existence I would like to use in my "working mode". <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
this happens to me while painting to, and even sometimes just in life- when<br>
it gets really interesting-  it isnt really the same as not having<br>
physicality, it is IMO, a function OF physicality.<br>
