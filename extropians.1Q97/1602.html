In a message dated 97-01-29 05:24:16 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  Is it your opinion somehow that being interested in mathematics turns <br>
<i> &gt; you into something non-sexed, or drains you of your attractiveness?  </i><br>
<i> &gt; Or interferes with your sexuality?  What an odd thing if you do. What </i><br>
<i> &gt; does one thing have to do with another?  </i><br>
 <br>
 Again, it's not a question of "being interested".  If Jennifer had had an <br>
 absolute commitment to mathematics, to the exclusion of everything <br>
 else, that would have changed her.  There is an inevitable trade-off.  <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes - Ok, everything we do changes us, to that extent, but you assert that<br>
would change her FEMININE parts...<br>
