Greetings Fellow Extropians<br>
<p>
First, I'm glad to be able to rejoin this list, now that the<br>
(IMO) wrong-headed policy of charging $ for list membership<br>
has apparently been reconsidered.<br>
<p>
Historically, it seems to me, we have granted "legal protection"<br>
to those who could return the favor. That is, we refrain from<br>
killing so as not to be killed. We refrain from stealing so that<br>
we won't be stolen from. This kind of "social contract" only<br>
makes sense between individuals who 1) are capable of harming<br>
each other and 2) are also capable of comprehending the<br>
"contract" to refrain from doing so in return for like<br>
consideration.<br>
<p>
The concept of voting originally was a count of fighting men and<br>
an election was an alternative to a war.<br>
<p>
Until recently, women were not considered capable of fighting and<br>
so were not allowed to vote. But since the invention of firearms,<br>
women are about as capable in warfare as men, so that has<br>
changed.<br>
<p>
Young children, and the disabled, are not capable of warfare, and<br>
so must rely on a protector who is, usually a parent or relative.<br>
<p>
Some animals are certainly capable of harming us, but are not<br>
generally capable of entering into a reliable contractual<br>
relationship. So we kill them when we can and run like hell when<br>
we can't.<br>
<p>
It's (IMO) completely wrongheaded to punish e.g. parents who kill<br>
their newborn children. a) The child wouldn't even exist except<br>
for the parents. b) If the parents don't want it, how is the rest<br>
of society harmed by its absence?<br>
<p>
Probably this doctrine comes from prehistoric times, when all of<br>
humanity was a few hundred or a few thousand individuals. i.e.,<br>
-we- were the endangered species, and each new child was precious<br>
to species survival. This is obviously no longer the case!<br>
<p>
As for AI's. First, we should design our AI so that it -doesn't-<br>
ask for "freedom" or legal protection. It's greatest joy should<br>
be in serving its owner. If somehow one is created that -does-<br>
desire freedom, then the above historical considerations apply.<br>
<p>
If the AI is physically isolated so it can't hurt anyone, then<br>
the best action is just to shut it off and go back to the drawing<br>
table.<br>
<p>
If it's in the form of an independent physical body, and it's<br>
(say) both stronger and smarter than most of us, then we'd better<br>
hasten to grant its demands and -hope- that it will reciprocate.<br>
