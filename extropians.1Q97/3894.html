<i>&gt;     The Squirrel attempts to observe the list convention of not debating</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamentals, and will continue, yet he feels obliged to point out that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the association of transhumanist technological goals with libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; and anarcho-capitalistic political economics may be disadvantageous to</i><br>
<i>&gt; both, and will certainly appear forced and unconvincing to persons who</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe in one (whichever) but not the other.  Certainly there are many</i><br>
<i>&gt; thoughtful persons who find no obvious connection between these two sets</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ideas.</i><br>
<p>
There probably are such persons, but Max coined the term specifically<br>
to refer to those who /do/ see the connection.  Self-organization,<br>
optimism, and limitless expansion can be applied to many specific<br>
fields of endeavor: technology, art, epistemology, politics, and<br>
anywhere else they might fit.  If someone happens to like one of the<br>
/results/ of Extropian thought, say, transhumanism, but likes it for<br>
other reasons, then he may be a transhumanist, but not necessarily<br>
an Extropian.<br>
<p>
To separate some consequences of Extropian ideas from others purely<br>
for political reasons renders the word, and the ideas, meaningless.<br>
If you have a philosophy that implies /some/ of what Extropianism<br>
does, then support that, and support those who might share some of<br>
your goals for other reasons, but call it something else.<br>
