<i>&gt; Oh, and I'm still not going to participate in your Poll, because you</i><br>
<i>&gt; left out Art again, even after Natasha reminded you.</i><br>
<p>
Okay... Somebody tell me.<br>
What is it, exactly, that Extropian Art does?  Why should I list it<br>
alongside cryonics, intelligence amplification, or the Singularity?<br>
<p>
Maybe I'm prejudiced; the only piece of Art I ever really liked was<br>
"Godel, Escher, Bach".  I see "Art" as being like "greatness"; you don't<br>
try to produce Art, you do the best you can and if it turns out to be<br>
Art, great.  As for all the pretty pictures, I'm not moved.<br>
<p>
This is not the time for trying to produce Art-as-art; the real goals<br>
are finally in sight and living, reproducing, and dying just doesn't cut<br>
it anymore as a goal in life.  So who needs Art?  We know why we're<br>
here, and what we're doing, and where we're going.<br>
<p>
  "I don't know that I ever wanted greatness, on its own.  It seems<br>
rather like wanting to be an engineer, rather than wanting to design<br>
something - or wanting to be a writer, rather than wanting to write.  It<br>
should be a by-product, not a thing in itself.  Otherwise, it's just an<br>
ego trip."  -- Merlin, "Prince of Chaos", by Roger Zelazny.<br>
<p>
At best, Extropian Art seems like a subcategory of the "Popularization"<br>
subcategory of "Recruiting".  Or maybe there should be an "Extropian<br>
Hobbies Of No Conceivable Use" column?  The idea is to rank in order of<br>
importance.<br>
<p>
But maybe I'm prejudiced, or artistically numb, or a Neanderthal.  And<br>
above all, I'm not in charge, or at least I'm trying not to be in<br>
charge.  Would one of you people make up your own poll instead of<br>
criticizing?  Let's see some Spontaneous Order around here.  Now.<br>
