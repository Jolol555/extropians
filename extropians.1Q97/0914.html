<i>&gt; From: "S.J. Van Sickle" &lt;sjvan@csd.uwm.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The danger and difficulty with "Don't let it bother you" is that it </i><br>
<i>&gt; is very easy to fool yourself into into to believing that is doesn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; bother you when it actually does.  This can lead to no end of </i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble.</i><br>
<p>
I agree very much with this, and more generally with the problems that<br>
arise with other ways of fooling yourself.  In fact, in my case I find it<br>
very easy to fool myself.  I used to experiment with self hypnosis, and<br>
I could convince myself through concentration that my arm was becoming<br>
stiff and rising into the air, and that I could not consciously bend<br>
or move it.  And it seemed that I did indeed lose control over my arm.<br>
No matter how I tried, I could not move it.  Then one time someone<br>
walked in on me when I was practicing this.  I snatched my arm down fast,<br>
embarrassed to be seen in such a peculiar position.<br>
<p>
The point is, I was just fooling myself in thinking I couldn't move my arm.<br>
Somehow I wasn't really trying to move it, I was just pretending to try to<br>
move it, and doing so in such a way that I could pretend that I wasn't<br>
pretending.  It's an odd phenomenon but I think this is how hypnosis works.<br>
<p>
When I was a boy I played with these ideas a lot.  In sixth grade I<br>
convinced myself that I could jump my consciousness forward in time<br>
to skip across an unpleasant experience, a test or dentist visit.<br>
I "leaped" forward before the event, and "caught" my consciousness once<br>
on the other side of the event, as though I had split into two parts,<br>
only one having to experience it.<br>
<p>
In college, I found a book called "Passages: A Guide to Pilgrims of the<br>
Mind", which had a lot of self-hypnosis tricks, including ways to fool<br>
yourself into thinking that you weren't feeling pain.<br>
<p>
However, I later came to believe that these stunts were not of genuine<br>
value.  Was I really not feeling pain?  Or was I feeling it, but denying<br>
it so thoroughly to myself that I wouldn't admit it?  Could I move that<br>
arm, or couldn't I?  It seemed like going down this path was just leading<br>
to a state where I had confused myself so much that I didn't know what I<br>
knew any longer.<br>
<p>
I chose to abandon this direction and focus on ordinary, simple living.<br>
I would try to accept my feelings, validate them, pay attention to them.<br>
It is a less ambitious way of life but I felt the other was ultimately<br>
too difficult for me, and even dangerous in some ways.<br>
<p>
