<i>                &gt;There is currently no evidence that gravity or time are </i><br>
<i>                &gt;discretely quantized.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
There is no proof but there is evidence, we know for sure that we will need <br>
new Physics because when things get very small General Relativity and Quantum  <br>
Physics are not compatible.<br>
This is why:   <br>
                     <br>
I have a gadget that can send out photons of light at any wavelength.  As the <br>
wavelength gets smaller the energy gets larger and so does the mass,  <br>
remember E =MC^2 so M= E/c^2.  At some point the wavelength is so small and  <br>
the mass is so great a mini Black Hole is formed.  The mass at which this <br>
happens is the Plank Mass M = [hc/G]^1/2 = 2.18 *10^-5  grams. <br>
h is the Plank constant divided by 2 PI, c is the speed of light and G  <br>
is the gravitational constant.   <br>
The Plank Energy is the energy of a photon powerful enough to make a <br>
Black  Hole and it is  E=  [hc^5/G]^1/2 = 1.22 *10^28 eV.  <br>
<p>
It gets worse, according to Heisenberg it is possible to get something for <br>
nothing, even in a vacuum you can borrow energy, but the more you borrow the <br>
shorter you can keep it. In this way a vacuum is full of virtual particles. <br>
The Plank Energy is a LOT of energy so you can't keep it for long.<br>
<p>
The Plank Time is t = [Gh/c^5]^1/2 = 5.38 * 10^-44 second , after this the  <br>
mini Black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation.<br>
The Plank Length is 10^-33 cm, the distance light can travel in the plank time.<br>
<p>
This is a short distance, very short. If the universe was a thousand times as <br>
large as what we now observe it, then this super universe would be to a <br>
proton as  a proton is to the Plank Length.<br>
<p>
Now that's small, but not infinitely small. At these distances Space-time <br>
becomes a confusing foam, to understand what is going on at even smaller <br>
distances we need quantum gravity and we don't  have that yet.                          <br>
<p>
I quote Richard Feynman, on the trouble quantum mechanics has with gravity <br>
and speculating on possible solutions:        <br>
<p>
   "Another way of describing this difficulty is to say that perhaps the idea <br>
    that two points can be infinitely close together is wrong- the assumption <br>
    that we can use geometry down to the last notch is false."     <br>
<p>
In other words, two points can not be INFINITELY  close together. Contrary to  <br>
high school geometry, a line is  NOT made of an INFINITE number of points.  <br>
Two points can  NOT be just anywhere, but only in a finite number of <br>
positions. What Feynman is saying is that when you are dealing with the ultra <br>
small not only are matter, energy, spin, and charge digital, so is space.                                  <br>
<p>
    <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;It [ Quantum Mechanics] says only that the precision of our </i><br>
<i>                &gt;outputs is limited by what we choose to observe--no limit at </i><br>
<i>                &gt;all on the unobservable precision </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You complain that I'm only talking about observable qualities, but we're  <br>
talking about a machine here, an analog computer, and that's the only thing  <br>
it can deal with. The quantum wave function may be continuos but that does us <br>
no good because experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function   <br>
F(x) of a particle, we can only measure the intensity of the wave function  <br>
[F(x)]^2 because that's a probability and probability we can measure. <br>
<p>
Matter is not smeared around, only the probability of finding it. If you look <br>
for an electron at a particular spot you may find one or you may not, you <br>
can't be certain, the best you can do is come up with probabilities. However <br>
one thing you CAN be absolutely certain of is that you will find an electron <br>
OR you will not. There is no middle ground, there is no chance you will find <br>
half an electron or "sort of" an electron. If an electron is detected when it <br>
hits a phosphorous screen it will produce a photon of light. If it is not <br>
detected it will not produce a photon of light. There are no other <br>
possibilities, it will never produce half a photon of light. If an electron <br>
is detected it ALWAYS acts like a particle. The probability of finding the <br>
particle acts like a wave and is not deterministic hence the random element.                                       <br>
