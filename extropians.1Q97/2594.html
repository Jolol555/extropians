<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:                 </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;I ask the computer program: "Suppose you decided to search for the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;smallest even number greater than 4 that is not the sum of two        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;primes (ignoring 1 and 2) and then stop. Would you ever stop?"</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;Hal:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;It says, "You bet I would.  I'd get bored after only a few numbers.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I've got better things to do with my time!"</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That was just one small example. The point is that there is no general method <br>
to know if ANY computer program will ever stop.<br>
          <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;The electronic computer is much faster than my old steam powered         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;biological brain, so it figures out in 10 seconds what I'm going to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;do in 10 minutes, but if the computer then tells me of it's        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;prediction about me, and my personality is such that out of pure         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;meanness I always do the opposite of what somebody tells me to do,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;then the prediction is wrong.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Hal:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;No, the prediction is right.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
How is it right? It did not predict that I would look at the box, but I did,  <br>
and all the predictions it made about me after that point are wrong.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The prediction was of what you would do given situation X.  When you         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;do something different, you are not in situation X, but situation Y,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;where Y = X plus the knowledge of what the prediction was.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly. My situation at X includes the prediction of what the magic box says  <br>
I will do, so for the magic box to predict what I will do it must also  <br>
predict what it will do. We need a super magic box for that.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You can make a trivial computer program which reads a  number and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;outputs the next number.  Now we will try to predict what it will         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;type next. We input our prediction  and see what it types. Our         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;prediction is always wrong! No matter what we input, it outputs         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;something different. This is not an example of free will by any        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reasonable criterion.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I think that we could both agree that a person is a being and a rock is not, <br>
but the dividing line between those two extremes is rather blurry and  <br>
arbitrary. I never claimed to have a good definition of "a being". <br>
My intuition tells me that such a simple program is not a being, but if you <br>
insist it is then I would have to say it has free will.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If you had a box which had a simulation of your mind which ran </i><br>
<i>        &gt;faster than your own, then you could always find out what you were </i><br>
<i>        &gt;going to do before you did it.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No you could not.  If you look at the box's prediction then you and the box  <br>
would be part of the same system and no system in general can predict what  <br>
it will do next. For example, just do the opposite of what the box predicts.<br>
   <br>
The bottom line is that regardless of how fast this box can emulate a brain <br>
it would be completely unable to accurately tell you what you will be doing <br>
in 10 minutes. It could however be able to accurately tell me what you will <br>
decide to do next and it could accurately tell you what I will decide to do <br>
next. According to my definition we would both have free will.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Would the existence of such a box make you doubt your own free will?  </i><br>
<p>
No.<br>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;Wouldn't it be strange to always have this box around which knew         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;exactly what you were going to do ahead of time?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The correct predictions the box made would not seem strange to me because I <br>
didn't see them. The prediction about me that I did see would not seem <br>
strange because they were wrong. I still feel free.<br>
<p>
