<i>&gt;This is scary.  I just checked it out on my system.  It is no longer a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mystery why Microsoft has not been hit with antitrust lawsuits.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;always been skeptical of conspiracy claims, but now I am ready to believe. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course, this poses little security risk to me and might be a convienent</i><br>
<i>&gt;way to spy on the leeches who use my computer.  Now, if only I could get</i><br>

Effectively, there's nothing really shocking about filed not really being<br>
"deleted". The files are still there, and will remain there until<br>
overwritten, Microsoft or no Microsoft. Data recovery techniques can recover<br>
data that has been written over or reformatted 8 or 9 times. If you think<br>
that this one little bug (let's call it a feature) is all that stands<br>
between you and secure computing, I have a lovely bridge to sell you. If you<br>
want total safety, use a laptop, and use removable drives with it, and keep<br>
those drives somewhere safe, like on your person at all times. Fortunatly,<br>
encryption pretty much makes this a non necessity. In any case, chances are<br>
you don't have any truly secret data anyways. I know my data aren't terribly<br>
secret, and if someone reads my email, they'll probably be too bored to do<br>
anything, unless they're nuts.<br>
