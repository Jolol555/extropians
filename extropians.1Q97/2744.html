Computer salespeople are rarely programmers!  It is the marketing <br>
types that make promises such as "We can write software to do X in Y <br>
months".  The programmers usually hear about this promise afterwards <br>
and can only roll their eyes and do their best to fullfill the hype.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we have a similar situation in the socio-economic policy <br>
marketplace where the chest-thumping politicians promise "We can <br>
create laws or programs to do X in Y months", and the socio-economic <br>
scientists can only roll their eyes and set out to gather as much data <br>
as they can from the latest experiment.<br>
