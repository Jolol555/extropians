<p>
But NO is not the only neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, there are=20<br>
several (some say several 100) kinds of neuron classes, and many kinds=20<br>
of synapse types, oodles of different neurotransmitters. NO's diffusion=20<br>

That would be very good news, if true. Otoh, it would require translation=<br>

Yeah, right ;) However, if evolution does indeed occur at such a grand=20<br>

It may be diffusion defines neighbourhood relation for conformal maps=20<br>

I doubt it, since STM has atomic resolution, and we already know where we=<br>

harder. I've watched an STM experiment which plucked Au clusters from the=<br>

I doubt this means mass-production. The whole idea of nanotechnology is=20<br>
that it can autoreplicate. Limited manipulation capability is almost=20<br>
