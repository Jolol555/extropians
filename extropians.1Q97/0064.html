&lt;&lt; Yes, I too am very glad that great religious scientists have, for whatever<br>
 <br>
 reasons,  chosen to devote at least some of their time to Science, I'm just<br>
 <br>
 saying I don't understand it, if I was  religious I could think of better <br>
 things to do than study Science. Actually, I don't think my view would be <br>
 completely incomprehensible to religious people, take Isaac Newton for <br>
 example. <br>
 <br>
Like worshipping, cringing and feeeling very very small? ; )<br>
I know what you mean. I don't understand it either. But maybe you would get<br>
tired of pleading and whining and accepting fate - and try something<br>
(science? art? philosophy?) to empower yourself, even if it meant risking the<br>
wrath of the big daddy-o.<br>

<i> &gt;&gt;Newton was a very religious man, Newton was a very obnoxious man, Newton</i><br>
was <br>
an arrogant bastard, Newton was the greatest genus that the Human Race has <br>
 yet produced. Tragically this colossal intellect was horribly infected with <br>
 the religious meme. This meme hijacked most of his massive mental machinery <br>
 and forced it to think and write far, far more about religion than about <br>
 Science. Today even Theologians admit that the many millions of words that <br>
 Newton wrote about The Bible are worthless. Newton advanced Science more<br>
than <br>
 any other Human Being, but I think it's one of the great tragedies of<br>
History <br>
 that the rarest, most valuable quality that existed in the world was not<br>
used <br>
 to full advantage. Think what Newton could have accomplished if his mind had<br>
<p>
 not been caught in a infinite loop, and I blame religion for that. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes I agree. After I posted that last message about how in the *past*,<br>
religion and "such rubbish" was the norm, I realized I was being just a<br>
teensy bit optimistic. 90 percent still believe, and among scientists it's 70<br>
percent still...<br>
Tragedy is a good word. Lunacy maybe even better....<br>
