My ideals tend to be a bit more long term [and perhaps more optimistic<br>
in the extreme] than others being they often require a great deal of<br>
enabling technology. In this case I<br>
can imagine a time where  nanotechnology will eventually [perhaps a well<br>
protracted eventually] make money obsolete. In the<br>
distant future it is likely that via things such as self-replicating,<br>
self-modifying, nano-objects, we will be able to create and<br>
dismantle whatever we require in real time. No money needed. Once you<br>
have a handful of these things, they will very rapidly<br>
create more of themselves by rearranging atoms very prevalent atoms.<br>
This of course is beyond what nanotechnology promises today,<br>
yet very likely in some distant future when our knowledge and technology<br>
has developed sufficiently.   <br>

  <br>
The single greatest motive for corruption is profit. Thats not<br>
particularly noble to me. Social Security was a great idea ... until<br>
some guy found a loop hole in the system and said, "Hey, you know what,<br>
we can borrow money from Social Security and<br>
promise to pay it back, but the catch is we never will. Free money!" <br>
    Currently money is *almost* neccessary to survive, and certainly<br>
neccessary to partake in society. This will not *always* be<br>
the case. Even now if one so desired they could choose to live off the<br>
land, growing their own food, etcetera. This is very<br>
possible in principle, but our government makes it financially<br>
impossible. We have to pay taxes on our land or else have it<br>
confiscated. Thus the law does not allow you to become wholly autonomous<br>
and self-sufficient in the United States. You have<br>
to earn a living in order to pay the taxes for the land you live on. I<br>
strongly believe that if some hippy nature freak wants to<br>
drop out of the system he or she should be able to do so. This would<br>
only require the removal of one tax, property tax, or at<br>
least the part of property tax which includes land. <br>

<i>&gt; No measure of value better than the dollar. </i><br>

What is the monetary value of your love for your mother?  <br>
  <br>
Tesla was working towards free energy for the masses, but then monetary<br>
interests such as Eddison and the US government<br>
quickly ended that noise. <br>

Right now the average price for internet access is probably about $20 in<br>
the US. Everyone online has equal access to the<br>
majority of the information, but it seems that once the technology is in<br>
place that everyone want to make it cost per/byte or<br>
per/page or what have you to access information. This will once again<br>
limit the amount of information the poor can access<br>
while the charge won't even noticably affect the wealthy. My site will<br>
remain free. If some how that makes me altruistic or a<br>
socialist then so be it. That is one of the greatest things I enjoy<br>
about the internet as it is now. Free info for all. Why make it<br>
cost when we don't have to? Its because people like yourself  believe<br>
there is "No motive more noble than profit". I strongly<br>
disagree. I find offering free information a hell of a lot more noble. <br>
  <br>
There is a fella by the name of Michael Hart who hopes to have10,000<br>
books online by the year 2002. Access will be free to<br>
them all. This is the kind of guy I admire. Not the owners of<br>
Amazon.com.  <br>
  <br>
"Some people say, ' I am the most powerful because I have the most<br>
power.' I say, 'I am the most powerful because I give the<br>
most power away.'" <br>

Books would be a hell of a lot cheaper if we would legalize marijuana<br>
and use it for paper instead. Its the fastest growing<br>
bio-mass in the world. Very inexpensive to produce. It generally lasts a<br>
great deal longer than the paper we use today also. <br>
  <br>
2% of our nation has 50% of the money. Money does not flow as freely as<br>
people often imagine. It is not easy to rise out of<br>
poverty. By defining minimum wage our puppet government is allowed to<br>
define just how many people will live in poverty,<br>
spending their lives enslaved to the system working 60-80 hour work<br>
weeks. I know many people who work these hours and<br>
are still barely able to make ends meet. Employment is modern slavery.<br>
We give our slaves just enough to survive, make them<br>
work long hours so they don't have time to question the system, and keep<br>
them numb and entertained via the television, our<br>
modern opiate of the masses. I think it will be a long time before<br>
people recognize employment as slavery, but they will, and<br>
then people will be working towards what will be neccessary to abolish<br>
it. It is certainly a long term goal and sounds ludicrous<br>
to 99% of the people I mention it to. "I like my job. I like my boss. My<br>
job is neccessary for survival." Yep, a lot of the slaves<br>
liked their jobs and masters also. It was neccessary for those slaves to<br>
remain slaves in order to survive. It was a small minority<br>
of slaves which actually attempted to escape the system. <br>
  <br>
What are there, like 6 billion people in the world, and about 40 million<br>
who have internet access. That means that less than 1%<br>
(about 0.6%) of our world population has internet access. The biggest<br>
hindering factors being economic, and then political.<br>
The cable guy was over the other day installing some new gizmo, and he<br>
started asking about my computer. He said that his<br>
kids would really like one but he can't afford it. He's lucky to keep<br>
food on the table. I tried to express to him that if his kids<br>
grew up computer illiterate that they might very well find themselves in<br>
the same position that he is now. And then I went on to<br>
explain how the internet could help them in regards to school (his boy<br>
paged him for help on some homework while he was<br>
here), but none the less, he is a hard working individual who cannot<br>
really afford it.  Food and rent are more important;<br>
Survival. <br>
  <br>
To sum up. Profit is not the most noble motive. It is the most likely<br>
motive to corrupt, particularly in the case of government<br>
officials. Some things cost a hell of a lot more than they should. Some<br>
things cost money now, and some things will soon cost<br>
money that do not need to, e.g., access to web pages. And someday,<br>
though probably long after I am dead, money won't<br>
even be an issue.  <br>
  <br>
Once we realize that money will not always be neccessary, we can then<br>
start moving towards it. Capitalism is great. I love the<br>
fact that I get to choose from 20 different stereo brands, but there are<br>
things we can do to refine the system so that we are not<br>
required to exploit and hinder so many people. Think about all the<br>
people working for a dollar a week [perhaps exagerated,<br>
perhaps not] in third world countries just to produce the clothing you<br>
are wearing. Is it really a matter of laziness. No. They do<br>
not have the opportunity to rise above their condition. The same is true<br>
of many people in the United States. <br>
  <br>
Most of the people on this list seem to be in favor of private<br>
education. Yes it is certainly better than public education. My<br>
fiance went to a private school from first to twelth grade. It cost<br>
about $9000 a year. Some students are accepted into<br>
Harvard from her school while they are only juniors. Almost all get into<br>
some Ivy League school or another. But who the hell is<br>
going to be able to pay that kind of money for an education? A very<br>
small minority. We just happen to live in third most<br>
wealthy county in the United States. If we kill public education, the<br>
majority of kids are going to be stuck in severely poor<br>
private schools, much poorer than they would be with government<br>
financing. And even if you argue that it is the parents fault<br>
that they have no money, it is certainly not the fault of the child. Why<br>
should that kid be forced to have a petty education? I'm certainly not a<br>
big fan of government intervention, but if we are going to move towards<br>
private education we need to make sure that everyone is going to get at<br>
least some minimally satisfactory level of education. You may think the<br>
government does not achieve this now, but it would be much worse without<br>
government financing, if all the money had to come from the<br>
neighborhoods the schools were located in. There are a lot of really<br>
poor neighborhoods out there.<br>
  <br>
Not all poor people are lazy and unambitious! Its the system that is<br>
messed up. Not the people. What kills me is poor<br>
Republicans, poor people that have been brain washed into thinking they<br>
are going to be rich, and thus they should embrace<br>
the political system with the greatest bias towards the rich. And thus<br>
they stab themselves in the foot, creating fewer<br>
opportunities for themselves to ever attain any wealth. <br>
