No fact, just a figure of speech. The core (sand grain/microparasite) <br>

the basic personality traits already crystallized, causing future <br>
direction of growth/atrophy.<br>

Thanks for pointing this out, I did not knew. I have no training in this <br>
area whatsoever.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; that remain fairly constant (and might have a biological explanation) </i><br>
<p>
I conjectured the determinant to be biological/precipitated development <br>
history. Everything. Nothing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; such as introversion/extroversion or novelty seeking, but these traits </i><br>
<i>&gt; may be expressed and re-evaluated in a multitude of ways as personality </i><br>
<i>&gt; develops. In the first grade, much of the mind of the child is still </i><br>
<i>&gt; under development.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, but how does one direct this developments, in an environment <br>
not entirely under our control? Which should be our means, since we can't <br>
do experimentation because of ethical constraints and time scales involved?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [ reform a learning-avoider, howto ] </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By finding out why the avoider avoids learning (lack of interest, social</i><br>
<i>&gt; pressure, resistance to authority, the use of wrong sensory modalities in</i><br>
<i>&gt; teaching etc.) and circumventing or removing the hinder. The most </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but what if it is a personality trait. Insulin shocks? Neurosurgery? <br>
Giving up?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; important thing is to learn what triggers the enthusiasm of the student - </i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever that may be - and then link it to learning. </i><br>
<p>
Current systems can't achieve this. This would need a personalized <br>
programme for every child, a couple of hard-to-fool agents benchmarking<br>
the development of the child/concocting its future programme. Even with a <br>
child:teacher ratio approaching unity this would be difficult to do, and <br>
a computer system? in an notoriously conservative/finance-cut <br>
environment, while the rest of the IT technology flashes past development <br>
stages, rate of acceleration itself increasing? Difficult. We don't have <br>
even emate300 approval yet, and it is a puny machine, compared to what <br>
infrastructure is actually needed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Potential there might well be (but how much?) </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; -- but what to do if there's no will? How to negate unfavourable </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; influences coming from outside the school?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not just a schooling problem, but a global problem. How to handle </i><br>
<i>&gt; a world where most people don't want to change themselves? </i><br>
<p>
That was the thing I was trying to convey. To change current paedagogical <br>
system is not just curing a case of (resisting) imbecility, but to quest <br>
against the current state of the world itself. Somewhat difficult.<br>
