In a message dated 97-03-22 13:28:08 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; Is it diagnosis from an armchair? I am not saying you are hand waving, <br>
 perhaps you are a psychiatrist and have the correct data for diagnosis, or <br>
 first hand knowledge of the party. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Please read Martin Seligman's book and decide for yourself:  _Learned<br>
Optimism_ I'm convinced. <br>
 <br>
Also, Harry Browne's book _How I found Freedom in an Unfree World_ exposes a<br>
lot of "trap" scenarios.   In some cases people "like" being<br>
negative-depressed, they are used to it and want everyone to join-in their<br>
"fun."  Not my kind of fun.  I like trying new things:  research, creativity,<br>
new technology, etc.  <br>
