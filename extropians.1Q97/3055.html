Natasha More:<br>
<i>&gt;Foucault offered new concepts that challenged people's assumptions about</i><br>
<i>&gt;prisons, the police, insurance, care of the mentally ill, gay rights, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;welfare.</i><br>
<p>
He also developed the concept of 'limit experience', something that <br>
greatly informed his own life.  Limit experience involves pushing the <br>
boundaries of physical and emotional experience through various types <br>
of experimentation, with the purpose of exploring the lines between <br>
life/death, sanity/madness, normal/abnormal.  He spent part of the last <br>
ten years of his life traveling anonymously through the Western US, <br>
particularly San Francisco, pursuing experiences.  Not even his lover <br>
knows fully what he did here in the States.  Anything he wrote about <br>
it other than the brief mentions in published essays was probably <br>
destroyed along with all the other notes Foucalt ordered destroyed after <br>
his death.  That saddens me, as I find great personal resonance with <br>
that aspect of his work.  <br>
