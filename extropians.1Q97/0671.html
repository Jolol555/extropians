You mean 15 ton (nuclear) impact ENERGY?<br>

I did some research on known meteor impacts and the various relevant values,<br>
and I was able to generate a baseline for meteor-nuclear equivalence.  Due<br>
to rounding, density estimations, and other error-inducing techniques, I<br>
estimate the error at +/- 25%.<br>
<p>
ENERGY WISE:<br>
<p>
10Mt (nuclear)  =       900kton (mass @ 11000 m/s)  = ~60m diameter ferrous rock<br>
<p>
(BTW, I verified the impact velocity for the sake of completeness.)<br>
<p>
Impact parameters, assuming 10Mt (energy, nuclear equivalence) impacts on earth:<br>
<p>
CRATER DEPTH:           Nuclear: 60 meters      Rock:   250 meters<br>
CRATER DIAMETER:        Nuclear: 2000 meters    Rock:   1500 meters<br>
<p>
<p>
CONCLUSION:  <br>
<p>
While the nuclear impact will impart greater damage over a larger area, a<br>
rock has *much* better penetration (good-bye, all but the hardest, deepest<br>
targets).  The crater diameter is mostly a function of hydrostatic shock.<br>
The spherical nature of a nuclear explosion will naturally produce better<br>
horizontal damage than a falling rock, which only generates maximal<br>
atmospheric compression in front of it.  However, the crater diameter *is*<br>
an indication of how the shockwave radii scale.  The cratering effects are<br>
known to scale roughly as a function of the cube root of impact/explosion<br>
energy.  You can make your estimations from there.<br>
<p>
It is obvious from the data that the size of the rocks you have to throw for<br>
large-scale nuclear impact equivalence is pretty large.<br>
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE:  According to sources, a rock must have a mass &gt;500 tons in<br>
order to impact at the above assumed velocity.  Rocks with less than 500<br>
tons mass are slowed by atmospheric drag to velocities less than 1000 m/s.<br>
A one ton rock will not work.<br>
<p>
FYI, My primary data source for falling rocks was the Barringer crater in<br>
Arizona.  The following is the data I collected from that impact independant<br>
of data I calculated:<br>
<p>
IMPACT VELOCITY :  11000 m/s<br>
DIAMETER        :  50 meters<br>
COMPOSITION     :  Nickel-Iron   (I assumed 7g/cc for density)<br>
CRATER DEPTH    :  200 meters<br>
CRATER DIAMETER :  1200 meters<br>
<p>
Calculated Impact Energy ~ 5-6 Mt (energy, nuclear equivalence)<br>
<p>
For additional energy information, you might want to check out Tunguska,<br>
Siberia in 1908.  That impact (although it never actually touched the<br>
ground) had an estimated damage equivalence to a 20-40Mt nuclear airburst<br>
(estimates vary) and the estimated size of the incoming object ( density<br>
estimated at 1-4g/cc ) is 50-100 meters diameter.  Impact velocity estimates<br>
range from 7-17 km/s.<br>
<p>
Factual damage figures: 2100 km^2 flattened by shockwave, 200 km^2 scorched.<br>
This is for speculation only as the information available on the Siberian<br>
impact is insufficient for useable calculations.<br>
<p>
<p>
Enjoy.<br>
