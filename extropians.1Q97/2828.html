Distributing the wealth evenly is not needed and will do a lot of damage<br>
early on, it could take years before the economy restores from such a blow,<br>
and many people will lose their confidence in the system, as who is to say<br>
such a redistribution is not scheduled again, and again ?, and what then<br>
would be the motivation to be succesful ?. IMO a good system of social<br>
mobility through a guaranteed high quality educational system will do the<br>
trick, and far more efficiently.<br>
