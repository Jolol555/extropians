Steve,<br>
<p>
Liked your post about Minsky and humor.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Okay!  Freud noticed jokes often have to do with taboos.  So he said</i><br>
<i>&gt; that humor seems to have to do with censors (his hypothesized thingies</i><br>
<i>&gt; that stop you from thinking in certain directions).</i><br>
<p>
I think this might be a fruitful idea to explore.  Like someone said<br>
the other day, authoritarian cults seem to despise humor.  I don't <br>
know if this is actually true or not, but if true, it might be some-<br>
thing that could lead us to a deeper understanding in this area.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But Minsky's idea of laughter as a sudden drastic intervention is</i><br>
<i>&gt; strikingly plausible and doesn't have a counterpart (that I can see--</i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't read Tom's paper) in the immunity metaphor.  It points out</i><br>
<i>&gt; that thoughts are fast, singular events taking place over a whole brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; at once, instead of slow-moving, gradual-working *little* particles</i><br>
<i>&gt; coming in hoards of duplicates like germs or genes or antibodies.</i><br>
<p>
This is also an excellent point.  When we start to look at thoughts<br>
(and memes as well) objects we need to keep in mind the limits of our<br>
metaphors.<br>
