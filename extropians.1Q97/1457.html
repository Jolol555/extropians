Lojban is a descendant of Loglan, which was invented by James Cooke<br>
Brown in the late 1950's.  A dispute between Brown and some of the<br>
Loglan community led to a schism in which Brown kept possession of<br>
the name Loglan.  The offshoot is named Lojban (pronounced LOAZH-bahn)<br>
but is similar in structure.<br>
<p>
The original Loglan was designed with many ambitious goals.  From the<br>
back cover of "Loglan 1, a logical language", the 1975 edition, by Brown:<br>
<p>
"Loglan is a language designed to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis that<br>
the natural languages limit human thought.  It does so by pushing<br>
those limits outward in predictable directions, principally by..." followed<br>
by a list of features, which are summarized by claims that the language<br>
is "transformationally powerful... metaphysically parsimonious...<br>
syntactically unambiguous... semantically non-restrictive... culturally<br>
neutral".<br>
<p>
My personal feeling, based on attempts to learn Loglan, and the<br>
experiences of others that I have read about, is that the language is hard<br>
if not impossible to learn and speak naturally.  A more recent linguistic<br>
theory is Noam Chomsky's idea of universal grammar, which proposes that<br>
all human tongues are constrained by the wiring of the brain to a small<br>
subset of the potentially imaginable languages.  It seems to me that<br>
Loglan (in at least some of its features) may be outside the range of<br>
what the human brain is wired to speak.  In this way it can be a test<br>
of Chomsky's idea as well as Whorf's, and I'd say the preliminary data<br>
favors Chomsky.<br>
