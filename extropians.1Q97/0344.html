<i>&gt; PC is an argumentative technique, where inadequately (according to their </i><br>
<i>&gt; lights) represented groups try to discredit their opponents by applying </i><br>
<i>&gt; emotionally loaded, ad hominish argumentation ("perfectly obvious... you </i><br>
<i>&gt; are a Commie/Nazi/paedophile if you think XY").</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The scientific work of de Garis is not connected to his world views at </i><br>
<i>&gt; all. Perhaps, we should discuss the instrumentality of CAM-flavoured </i><br>
<i>&gt; systems in artificial cognition, not whether the person de Garis eats </i><br>
<i>&gt; baby bacon crisps for breakfast. </i><br>
<p>
The instrumentality of CAM-flavored systems in artificial cognition is<br>
not as universally relevant to extropians as is the nature of genius.<br>
And I think it is not unfair to point out to a researcher in artificial<br>
cognition that his own organic cognition--which will have an impact on<br>
his work--is faulty.  de Garis's manifest sexism is, as you say, no<br>
more relevant to his field of study than Teller's alleged racism was<br>
to nuclear fusion.  But sexism itself, and de Garis's outrageous use<br>
of it, /is/ worthy of discussion in itself.<br>
<p>
As Eli points out, the fact that the extra Y chromosome gives males<br>
a 2% advantage in genetic diversity is suggestive--but only that.  To<br>
use this as a post-hoc justification for the historical dominance<br>
of men in the face of clear evidence of social causes rather than<br>
biological ones is a disgraceful misapplication of science, and it is<br>
quite proper to call him on it.<br>
<p>
The question for extropians is what is the nature of genius.  The<br>
fact that by some particular measure (say SATs), men dominate in<br>
large numbers tells us interesting things that deserve study.  What<br>
is it about the different ways boys and girls are raised, the ways<br>
they are treated in society, the ideas about sex propogated by the<br>
popular media, and yes, even their biology and social evolution,<br>
that may have led to this state of affairs, and how can we apply<br>
these conditions to more potential geniuses?  What is it about the<br>
nature of our measurement that might be biased?<br>
<p>
Let us strive to find more facts not to justify prior conclusions,<br>
but to suggest, criticize, and realize new possibilities.<br>
