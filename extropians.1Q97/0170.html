<p>
Moon differentiated allright after accretion, whether it happened on its <br>
own, or while it has been part of the Earth. Al, Si, Ti (8% in some <br>
specimens!) and O are merely the more common elements, the Moon contains <br>
everying the Earth does (but in different ratios). It has equivalents of <br>
Earth's gabbro, basalt, etc., and that's all it is needed. Light elements <br>
(especially O/H from water, and complex organics) are expecially abundant in <br>
carbonaceous chondrite, which is not present on the Moon (it was cooked <br>
during differentiation, and carbonatios chondrite meteorites are <br>
denaturated upon impacts, which applies much less to the iron/nickel ones).<br>
<p>
What do you need oxygen for? It will be a waste product of element <br>
production (which oxide you use is pretty the same in terms of energetics), <br>
and machines do not need oxygen, for reaction mass merely, maybe. A <br>
von-Neumann probe does not need humans to operate, maybe shipping and <br>
installing essential 'vitamins' (dies) now and then. Sophisticated <br>
autoreplicating technology does not even need that, being fully <br>
autonomous/autarc. You can even produce 3d circuitry with beam writers, <br>
if you only willing to wait. I doubt cicuitry producing processes will be <br>
bottleneck, anyway.<br>
<p>
Producing glass for substrate, metals for wiring/reflective coating, <br>
silicon for photovoltaics, etc. are extremely energy-intensive processes. <br>
Even if we minimize the bulk (to maximize autoreplication rate), the <br>
growth will still be slow.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; As far as we know, ore concentration processes (biological, water,</i><br>
<p>
Ah, vulcanists vs. neptunists, again. Biological processes are less <br>
relevant, if you're not interested in hydrocarbons, water is not <br>
interesting, as well. Metals, glass, and silicon (and a thimblefull of <br>
more rare elements) should be sufficient for an autoreplicator.<br>
<p>
You can't use tellurian processes in vacuum, anywere. It is <br>
complementary: what is hard here, is easy there, and vice versa.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; tectonics) never happened on the Moon, so one shovelful of dirt is as good</i><br>
<i>&gt; as another. Teleoperated earthmovers should suffice for "mining" equipment.</i><br>
<p>
Not, so, the "dirt" is pretty heterogenous. Teleoperation is nice, but <br>
second-long lags should be extremely annoying to human operators. I've never <br>
tried, though, so one might adapt to it, with use. Sending people into <br>
space is extremely wasteful, imo. I think skipping manned spaceflight <br>
altogether, progressing immediately to the upload stage should be much more <br>
profitable in terms of roi.<br>
