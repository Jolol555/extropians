What if the "Singularity" gets out of control and messes up Gaia?<br>
I don't worry about it *too* much, but it's certainly a possibility.<br>
I don't just mean technologically, I also mean politically, and in<br>
the effects that the new technologies will have on the political<br>
structure. With no more Cold War, there's no telling what bored<br>
and powerful politicians will do. I would prefer to see at least<br>
some Diaspora before anything much like what people have been<br>
predicting for the "Singularity" gets going.<br>
<p>
Also, what about the hundreds or thousands of Amor, Apollo, and<br>
Aten objects that cross Earth's orbit? Or even better, a high energy<br>
comet?  We are on the edge of being able to buy ourselves insurance<br>
against the fate of the dinosaurs... I don't like keeping all my<br>
eggs in just one basket.<br>
