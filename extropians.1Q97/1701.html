I sent my post on Quantum Computers to comp.ai.philosophy, this is what<br>
Hans Moravec (Mind Children,) has to say on the subject. Moravec by the<br>
way is a fan of Uploading.<br>

No, this is not quantum-scale integrated circuitry, but<br>
something exponentially wilder:<br>
<p>
Quantum mechanics describes unobserved systems as existing<br>
in a "superposition" of all possible states, each weighted<br>
by an amplitude and a phase.  A particle whose position<br>
is known has unknown momentum.  Its future path is then described <br>
by a wavefront of all possible directions it could go.  <br>
This wavefront is very real, as can be demonstrated by<br>
putting a barrier with two slits in its path.  After doing<br>
the experiment repeatedly, a banded pattern of hits builds<br>
up on a screen beyond the barrier, that can be explained as<br>
the interference between the two possible paths each particle<br>
could have taken to its hit on the screen.  Each path has<br>
a phase and an amplitude, and for some screen positions the<br>
phases are opposite, causing the two possibilities to<br>
partially or completely cancel. Other places, in phase, they<br>
mutually reinforce. <br>
<p>
Quantum computing creates n "qbits", each in an independent<br>
unobserved state of superposition of 1 and 0. Together,<br>
they constitute a machine with all 2^n possible combinations<br>
of states superimposed. By manipulating things like external<br>
fields, this giant superposition is then stepped through a<br>
sequence of computations, without being observed, producing<br>
a superposition of 2^n answers. When the superposition is<br>
finally observed to get an answer, the 2^n possibilities<br>
interfere, cancelling some outcomes, making others more<br>
probable.  By cleverly designing the computation, the<br>
interference can be tailored to filter a desired result.<br>
<p>
Quantum computing became really exciting about two years<br>
ago when Peter Shor showed how a quantum computer with a<br>
few times n qbits could be used to factor n bit numbers in<br>
little more than linear time.  On a classical computer,<br>
which can be in only one state at a time, factoring seems<br>
to take time exponential in the size of the number.<br>
<p>
In some limited circumstances, quantum computing gives<br>
the effect of a parallel computer with 2^n processors, in<br>
a single machine with n quantum bits.  If it were possible<br>
to push n to hundreds of qbits, a quantum computer could<br>
complete computations beyond a classical atomic-scale<br>
computer filling the universe.<br>
<p>
The catch may be that things like the noise-to-signal ratio <br>
of the final measurement, or the difficulty of maintaining <br>
the coherence of the qbits (i.e. of isolating them from any <br>
possible observation via interaction with the outside world) <br>
goes up exponentially with the number of qbits.  <br>
But these limitations may be just properties of <br>
particular implementations.  As the Science article<br>
showed, the fun has just begun, and dramatically better<br>
approaches are still being created and developed.  One of<br>
the first approaches, using the spin states of individual<br>
laser-trapped atoms to represent qbits, lost its coherence<br>
on the time scale of milliseconds.  The magnetic-resonance<br>
approach described in Science, which uses the spin of atomic<br>
nuclei, shielded from the world by their fuzzy balls of<br>
orbiting electrons, can maintain coherence for an hour!<br>
