<p>
That's partly because these philosophies, etc. have already defined by<br>
myriad other cultural devices. So interpretation of their artwork is<br>
necessarily tempered: as I said, art is a discourse based upon existent<br>
information. (Yet, ask someone to describe Jesus and they'll come up with a<br>
bearded young bloke - essentially a representation of Zeus, with a little<br>
Alexander the Great thrown in: and this is simply because of early<br>
Christian artwork. For that matter: God's this old bloke with a white<br>
beard. And yes, _you_ may question this, but others would not: that's<br>
because art is a discourse between work and particular observer.)<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;To make artists definers or cheerleaders...</i><br>
<p>
Nobody makes them such. They _are_ such because they are presenting<br>
Extropianism to and audience with no, or minimal, prior information. They<br>
don't need to have authority vested upon them. If I created art-work<br>
showing graphic and cruel vivisection, called myself an Extropian artist<br>
and displayed all over Britain, how many people would question my view<br>
vocally and publicly enough to undermine the imagery placed in the minds of<br>
those who attended the shows? Even if Max et al. publicly denounced me I<br>
suspect the image of Extropianism in this country would take years to recover.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...our [artists, I assume] role involves the challenging of assumptions</i><br>
and &gt;the exploration of new avenues of thought.<br>
<p>
A piece of artwork cannot challenge generic 'assumptions'. It can only<br>
challenge the particular assumptions of its audience. Very few people have<br>
any assumptions at all about Extropianism, so artwork has the ability to<br>
create, rather than challenge, any assumptions about Extropy. Another<br>
example: if I paint a series of pictures showing Max wearing flowing robes,<br>
in front of a cross, preaching to people, then how many people do you think<br>
will not consider Extropianism some wacky cult. (To avoid argument the<br>
paintings would bear the legend 'Saint Max - Extropian leader' in an halo<br>
around his head.) Of course, some people, not brought up within Western<br>
Christendom, may not see the imagery, but that's my point exactly.)<br>
