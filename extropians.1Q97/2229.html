<i>&gt;&gt;  I think part of the trick is to talk from your diaphragm instead</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  of from your throat or chest.  Proper ki-yis in karate are like</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  this.  If you take </i><br>
<p>
Talking from deep in your diaphragm is indeed the biggest part of it.<br>
This is probably one of the few things I learned from two years of<br>
ROTC that is still sometimes useful to me.  (The marines called it<br>
"command voice" and definitely considered it something to be taught.<br>
It was an important part of marching drill.)<br>
<p>
I get my best exercise in speaking loudly ("bellowing" is a good term<br>
for it) at sporting events, either as a spectator or a participant.<br>
You can holler from one end of a softball field to the other and<br>
people are pretty impressed sometimes.  Once you master the technique,<br>
you can help people near you in the stands who are quietly trying to<br>
get the attention of someone in the next section.  I often add my<br>
voice to someone who is off by 20 decibels or so.  They usually<br>
appreciate it.<br>
