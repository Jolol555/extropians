Yes, I was thinking of something like this a few days ago; essentially it<br>
would become an anonymous remailer for Web pages. The system I was<br>
thinking of was something like: <br>
<p>
    Browser sends URL to proxy; this is encrypted with the public<br>
	key of the proxy.<br>
    Proxy decrypts URL and fetches the appropriate page. This page is<br>
	also encrypted with the public key of the proxy, which decrypts<br>
	it and passes it back to the browser.<br>
<p>
This serves two functions; firstly, even if someone finds your web page at<br>
the real host it will be encrypted so that only the proxy can read it.<br>
This means that if the Feds ask you to decrypt the page *you can't*. You<br>
would need the private keys of all the proxies in the chain to decrypt it<br>
(of course, you'd need to keep a plaintext copy in case one of the proxies<br>
goes down or changes the key). <br>
<p>
Secondly, a proxy which works in this way can be chained just like a<br>
remailer. The encrypted URL can contain another encrypted URL to be sent<br>
to the next proxy in the chain. Using five or six proxies should<br>
complicate traffic analysis enough to keep your page hidden if the traffic<br>
levels are high enough. <br>
<p>
Most likely you'd want the equivalent of a Web 'nymserver', such that you<br>
could create a URL like '<a href="http://www.nymserver/cool-illegal-page.html'">http://www.nymserver/cool-illegal-page.html'</a> and<br>
the nymserver would read the full encrypted URL from a database. This<br>
would also allow you to mirror pages easily, and could be used as a<br>
justification for the site. You could sell it as a server allowing people <br>
to move their pages around but keep a fixed URL, and the 'remailed' URLs <br>
would just be a special case.<br>
