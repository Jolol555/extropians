Lyle Burkhead:<br>

Right.  And anyone who doesn't take the responsibility to find out <br>
the hows and whys behind any substance--herbal, pharmaceutical, <br>
recreational--that they put into their bodies puts themselves at the <br>
mercy of false claims by hucksters, overmedication by misguided <br>
doctors, or toxicity from bad combining.  <br>
<p>
Have you heard the news reports about the hundred-odd people at a <br>
rock concert in the DC area who ingested a totally unidentified blue <br>
liquid simply because it was there?  Several became violently ill and <br>
were hospitalized.  Took the FBI lab over a day to figure out what they <br>
had ingested.  Turned out to be a mixture of several synthetic drugs <br>
probably not of the purest grade.  Words like 'stupid' come to mind <br>
here.<br>
<p>
Ah well, rant over.<br>
