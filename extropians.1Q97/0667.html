<i>&gt; This is all good and well, ASSUMING, that you are using radar sensing</i><br>

So, what are they using? In order to detect something at a distance in a<br>
vacuum you have to either bounce EM radiation off of it, or look for the<br>
EM radiation that it emits. Which are they doing, and what with? <br>
<p>

<p>
Hmm, isn't that about the same figure that I gave, if you scale it for 1MT<br>
rather than 10MT? That is, 500 - 1000 x 10^(1/3) ~= 1200 - 2400.  AFAIR I<br>
said 1500 for 10 MT, and actually that was diameter rather than radius so<br>
your figure would be larger. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reason is apparently</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;From what I remember the moon is renound for propagating shock waves </i><br>
extremely well, though that probably doesn't apply for the surface soil. <br>
I don't remember how deep it is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Note that this is not an exact science, and that there are many factors</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, but I was assuming an underground base anyway so the difference <br>
doesn't seem to be significant.<br>
