What do people think about the way the industrialized, non-communist world<br>
has been heading towards gradual socialization ever since Marx?  Extropy<br>
appears to have a faith in evolution and boundless expansion-a constant<br>
increase in extropy created by life wading upstream against the<br>
"inevitable" heat death of the universe due to the laws of thermodynamics.<br>
Why, then, do we see the flourishing of socialism?  Is it simply due to<br>
the entropic influence of socialistic idealists?  If I were to accept this<br>
answer, one would have to tell me why it is that Japan, being one of the<br>
more socialistic of the industrialized nations, is so extropic- by this I<br>
mean they are way ahead of the rest of the world in longevity(mostly<br>
because their cuisine is naturally high nutrient/low calorie) and they<br>
produce new technology at a rate much higher than the rest of the world.<br>
It seems that if the technological singularity spawns from one point, it<br>
will be Japan.  Also,  the country I am from, Canada, is very socialistic<br>
and also very technologically-oriented(which is not what some<br>
"brazil-of-the-north" environmental alarmists might have you believe,<br>
suggesting that Canada is a wood-harvesting-based economy)<br>
Canadians are in general optimistic about technology, interested in<br>
longevity, and positive about the future, yet this is combined with a<br>
strong feeling that government and social agencies play an important role<br>
in the future, and I don't think many believe volunteer  organizations are<br>
ready to take over the function of these institutions.  It seems to me<br>
that the most competent workers and minds in our society are not<br>
volunteers- society tends to condition talented people to use their<br>
talents to make money, rather than to volunteer for the benefit of<br>
humankind.  Although I agree with the other principles of extropianism, I<br>
am not wholly convinced that people will volunteer enough to maintain the<br>
social programs such as secondary and post-secondary education that we<br>
enjoy today.  This seems to me like a similar assumption to that of Karl<br>
Marx, that people are just going to "do their part" because they are so<br>
glad to be in the idyllic society that they are in .  For Marx, it was an<br>
idyllic society of equality, for extropianism, it is an idyllic society of<br>
freedom.<br>
