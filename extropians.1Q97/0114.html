Huh? What do you mean by personality cores? My impression, after <br>
finishing an introductory psychology course, is that personality is very <br>
flexible long past adolescence. There are of course some basic traits <br>
that remain fairly constant (and might have a biological explanation) <br>
such as introversion/extroversion or novelty seeking, but these traits <br>
may be expressed and re-evaluated in a multitude of ways as personality <br>
develops. In the first grade, much of the mind of the child is still <br>
under development.<br>

<p>
By finding out why the avoider avoids learning (lack of interest, social<br>
pressure, resistance to authority, the use of wrong sensory modalities in<br>
teaching etc.) and circumventing or removing the hinder. The most <br>
important thing is to learn what triggers the enthusiasm of the student - <br>
whatever that may be - and then link it to learning. <br>

<p>
This is not just a schooling problem, but a global problem. How to handle <br>
a world where most people don't want to change themselves? <br>
