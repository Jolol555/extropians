<i>&gt;To be precise, let's put the meme this way: "Words which honestly</i><br>

<i>&gt;in some listeners, and it is therefore advisable to not express those</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas."  The delimma of psychological causality does complicate matters,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but the nature of the bad meme is clear: the meme says shut up because</i><br>
<i>&gt;you might cause offense.</i><br>
<p>
Before I thought you were overstating your case, now it seems to<br>
me that you are constructing strawmen. The argument you present<br>
above bears little resemblance to the argument that drew my objection.<br>
I have no sympathy with the idea you present in the paragraph above,<br>
and I enthusiastically join you in condemning it.<br>
<p>
Originally, you picked out two sentences for criticism: "You<br>
shouldn't offend people" and "People can be hurt by words". The<br>
second sentence is demonstrably true (I have deliberately hurt far<br>
too many people with the cruelty of my tongue to believe otherwise).<br>
The first sentence, being a moral injunction, yields its truth-value<br>
less easily. But neither of these statements that you originally<br>
singled out for criticism say "shut up because you might cause<br>
offence". To me, they say rather, "phrase your criticism in a way<br>
that shows some awareness of and sensitivity to the emotional<br>
predispositions of your audience".<br>
<p>
Now, this last, it seems to me, is perfectly good advice that should<br>
be taken by any good selfish egoist, because criticisms so phrased<br>
will be far more effective in communicating something to your<br>
audience, and possibly even in correcting some bad beliefs or<br>
behavior on the part of your audience. I don't see the ideas you<br>
choose to attack as silencing devices; instead I see them as<br>
exhortations to use effective rhetoric rather than ineffective<br>
rhetoric.<br>
<p>
Again, I think I have the gist of what you are saying. Ideas very<br>
closely related to the ones you originally chose to criticize *have*<br>
been used to silence people (another example of using words and<br>
ideas to hurt).  But we have to be careful when we want to accuse<br>
other people of using sneaky means to silence their opponents; we<br>
have to make sure that our arguments are exactly right, and we have<br>
to avoid overstating our case, or we get nowhere.<br>
