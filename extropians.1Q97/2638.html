<i>&gt;&gt; I think the confusion lies in thinking that the definition of truth</i><br>

<p>
Isn't practical functionality real functionality, true functionality; or<br>
is there some pretend kind of functionality that would do just as well?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The definition of truth stipulates an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; *ideal* scenario.  It defines what we *want*.  It doesn't help us to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; there.  (That much of the hullaballoo against truth this century is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; correct. But to ditch truth as a concept, an ideal, is to throw the baby</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; out with the bathwater.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I want to make an atom bomb. What matters is that it functions to</i><br>

<i>&gt;While I am making my atom bomb, all that matters is that each part of it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is functional. Each part must do what I intend it to. I can create my</i><br>
<i>&gt;atom bomb without every worrying about the concept of truth. If</i><br>
<i>&gt;something does not function then I must figure out where the cause of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the dysfuntion lies and fix it so that it does function. I can throw the</i><br>
<i>&gt;immaculate child out with the bathwater and still create my bomb and</i><br>
<i>&gt;annhilate a great number of people. It still functions. Something works,</i><br>
<i>&gt;partially works, or it doesn't work. I don't have to invoke any such</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept as truth to deal with these matters.  </i><br>
<p>
Again, I would say that if you are concerned with functionality you are<br>
concerned with real functionality: you want the damn thing to work *in<br>
reality*, do you not?  I don't understand what difference you see<br>
between what you call 'functionality' and truth, facts.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Conjecture and truth are not in competition: everything that we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that we *call* truth we *conjecture* to be truth in the ideal sense.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; really don't see what's so difficult or problematic about this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oh, I understand the concept quite clearly. I am only saying that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept is unnecessary and only serves to create particular bias', which</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have detailed exhaustively, which hinder the evolution of science as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;tool itself.</i><br>
<p>
It seems to me you are just looking for another *word* than 'truth',<br>
perhaps because it has been used pompously in the past, like a stick to<br>
beat people over the head with.  Nevertheless, I don't think you can get<br>
away from the *concept*, which is a *functioning* concept.  You can't<br>
escape the distinction between what *is* the case and what we *think* is<br>
the case, as your talk about functionality above shows, and as your talk<br>
below about signified and signifier also shows.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; [interesting discussion of 'conjecture' and new coinage of 'conjection'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; snipped]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I believe these terms or terms created with similar meaning, would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;more suitable to PCR.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I don't: it seems needlessly complicated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But sometimes we must complexify our theories in order to make them more</i><br>
<i>&gt;useful. We certainly want the fewest terms possible to serve our</i><br>
<i>&gt;purposes, but I believe that some of us are beginning to want more from</i><br>
<i>&gt;science than it is now capable. In order for it to become so, its</i><br>
<i>&gt;underlying concepts must evolve. Can you imagine something beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt;science as we know it today, or do you believe that we have attained the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ultimate tool. I'm fairly certain something lies beyond it. In order to</i><br>
<i>&gt;get there I am going to criticize science as it is today, while</i><br>
<i>&gt;attempting to find alternatives.</i><br>
<p>
I can imagine science developing new techniques, but I can't imagine<br>
anything different from science, which is just the quest for truth,<br>
nothing more, nothing less.  Seeking the truth is a possible thing you<br>
can do, and that possibility is forever open.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; What you are talking about, with your waves example (and such things as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the the traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Eskimo's snow example, which was recently and amusingly discussed here)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is, I believe, this: there are many different ways of being interested</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in things, and these different ways of being interested in things will</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; prompt us to ask different questions, with different levels of focus on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; reality.  But if I, with my meager knowledge of waves ask "is that an x</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wave or a y wave?" that question can be answered truly or falsely; and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; if a wave-expert asks "is that an x1, y, alpha, gamma or epsilon wave?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that question can be answered truly or falsely.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When we say that is an x1, y, or alpha wave, we are refering to an</i><br>
<i>&gt;arbitrary type. Part of the confusion is in believing that our arbitrary</i><br>
<i>&gt;deliniations are real. It would be more appropriate to say that this</i><br>
<i>&gt;wave FUNCTIONS as an x1 wave rather than this wave IS an x1 wave. For it</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot BE an x1 wave. It can only functionally represent an the ideal of</i><br>
<i>&gt;an x1 wave. Do you see how truth confuses the issue, where functionality</i><br>
<i>&gt;is much more useful and rational? When we say this wave is an x1 wave we</i><br>
<i>&gt;are saying one thing yet meaning something *slightly* different, but if</i><br>
<i>&gt;I say that this wave functions as an x1 wave, then I am being much more</i><br>
<i>&gt;clear about what I mean.     </i><br>
<p>
I don't understand what you mean by 'arbitrary': surely, if we ask<br>
questions of the world, and we get a coherent response, then our<br>
question has 'carved nature at the joints', at least to some extent? <br>
It's possible that an idea may be arbitrary in the sense that we woke up<br>
one morning and just had it, but if, as soon as we apply it to the world,<br>
the idea is coherent (gets coherent responses) then it's not arbitrary,<br>
it *fits* the world.  Again, I would ask you, are you interested in real<br>
functionality, or some other kind?<br>
<p>
Actually, I've just realised where I think you are going wrong.  You<br>
think that 'being' is a static term, and truth, since it is related to<br>
being, as static also.  'Being' to me is an all-inclusive concept,<br>
denoting what exists, which includes things, experiences, events,<br>
functions, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you familiar with the concepts of the signifier and signified, of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the difference between indexes, icons, and symbols? The concept of truth</i><br>
<i>&gt;confuses the distinction between these things. In the case above it</i><br>
<i>&gt;confuses the signifier symbol of x1 with the signified wave. They are</i><br>
<i>&gt;not the same. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
But that's precisely what I'm saying: they are not the same at all. <br>
That there is such a thing as an x1 wave at all is a conjecture; but it<br>
is not an arbitrary conjecture because it coheres with the rest of our<br>
thought and our experience, so what else ought we to think other than<br>
that it probably does correspond in the absolute sense?  Until a *more*<br>
coherent (more 'functional'  in your sense?) concept comes along, we are<br>
perfectly entitled to think that it denotes something real, and that a<br>
question involving its use has a true or false answer.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that you are following the postmodernists into a blind<br>
alley. Let me put it this way: if I put a stick in the ground, then<br>
things have an objective distance from it.  My placing of the stick may<br>
have been 'arbitrary' in some sense, but the distances are not.  The<br>
trouble with postmodern thinkers is that having successfuly demolished<br>
'presence' and 'intrisicism' they think they have demolished objectivity<br>
and truth.  Not so: for truth never *did* depend on presence and<br>
intrinsicism.  Those elements of presence and intrinsicism in Platonic/<br>
Aristotelian thinking were in fact elements of subjectivity, granted (as<br>
you say, confusion of signified and signifier).  <br>
<p>
I think what happened was that philosophers wanted to keep their cake<br>
and eat it: they wanted the functionality of the concept of objectivity/truth,<br>
which distinguishes between what is and what we think is, but they also<br>
wanted a sort of surreptitious, backdoor guarantee that after all, there<br>
might be some sort of queer connection between what is and what we think<br>
is such that, in some cases, what we think is *guaranteed* to be true.<br>
But this quest contradicts the very idea of truth, the very point of the<br>
concept of objectivity: so it's no surprise that this quest has been<br>
completely and utterly seen for what it is this century.<br>
<p>
But this victory is *not* a victory over the concept of truth, but a<br>
victory over a misunderstanding of it.<br>
