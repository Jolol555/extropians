                   <br>
<p>
The experience, the feeling of free will comes from our own uncertainty, <br>
we don't know what we will do next because we don't understand ourselves very <br>
well. I don't think it's any more profound than that.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;the chemical proper ties of the brain that we can understand                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;don't explain it [free will]</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If we could explain our free behavior then we could understand it, if we <br>
understood it then we could predict it if we could predict it then we <br>
wouldn't have it. We have free will if and only if we can't explain it.<br>
<p>
                     <br>
<i>                &gt;so we must not know everything about how those atoms behave.</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
It's not atoms fault, there are just too many properties and too many atoms. <br>
We don't know how atoms behave in complex situations and the brain is about <br>
as complex as you can get, and to make matters FAR worse, the act of trying <br>
to figure out what the atoms in my brain will do next, changes those very <br>
atoms. The very act of thinking about the state of my brain changes the state <br>
of my brain.     <br>

<p>
Tell me what you mean by free will then we can talk about how much of it we <br>
have. If you mean our inability to predict what we will do next, then we have <br>
a lot of it. If you mean our actions are completely independent of outside <br>
forces then we probably have a little of it, but far more than I'd like <br>
because that's nothing but pure randomness.      <br>
