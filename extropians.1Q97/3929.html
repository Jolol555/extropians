I recently bought this book: <br>
<p>
   The Sovereign State and Its Competitors, by Hendrik Spruyt, 1994.<br>
<p>
The abstract on the book says:<br>
<p>
  The present international system, composed for the most part of<br>
  sovereign, territorial states, is often viewed as the inevitable<br>
  outcome of historical development.  Hendrick Spruyt argues that there<br>
  was nothing inevitable about the rise of the state system.  Examining<br>
  the competing institutions that arose during the decline of feudalism<br>
  - among them urban leagues, independent communities, city states, and<br>
  sovereign monarchies - Spruyt disposes of the familiar claim that the<br>
  superior size and war-making ability of the sovereign nation-state<br>
  made it the matural successor to the feudal system.<br>
<p>
This book recounts this history of how the city states of Italy and the<br>
Hanseatic League of german cities lost their compeition with<br>
neighboring sovereign states.  This history is of course uniquely<br>
relevant to the viability of decentralized political visions such as<br>
anarcho-capitalism.<br>
<p>
I can't say this is a great book, just the first I've read on the<br>
topic.  Contrary to the encouraging abstract above, the book does<br>
conclude that centralized states had these fundamental advantages:<br>
<p>
1. Sovereigns were better able to encourage trade by overcoming local <br>
political resistance to standardizing measures, taxes, and laws.<br>
2. Leagues of cities had trouble committing their members to courses<br>
of action.  Defecting cities were hard to detect and to punish<br>
regarding tolls, piracy, fraud, contributions to military campaigns, and<br>
individual negotiations with foreign powers. <br>
<p>
If this is a reasonable summary of this history, it suggests that <br>
free-riding and coordination problems could doom decentralized<br>
political systems.  It seems important for fans of such systems to<br>
take a closer look at this history.  <br>
