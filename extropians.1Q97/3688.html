<i>&gt;There's something I don't understand about all the excitement over push.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seems to me that the push concept conflates two relatively independent</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas: content filtering, and when-available delivery.</i><br>
<p>
My theory is that this is just a strangely strong example of a phenomenon<br>
that happens a lot in writing about technology--one detail pushes people<br>
over a sort of threshold where they're able to imagine a lot of things<br>
all of a sudden, and they attribute these possibilities to the one detail,<br>
rather than going back and a) asking what depends on what, or b) thinking<br>
about their own previous lack of imagination.<br>
<p>
This is part of the *real* process of mythologizing technology that I wish<br>
people would study more.  It's not just that people view technology as<br>
inevitable.  It's that they paste retroactive rationales and categories<br>
on it, package-dealing things.  Marketing needs to create categories<br>
and distinctions...  But why *journalists* play along *so* slavishly,<br>
so eagerly, so...pro-distractively, I can't figure.  It seems partly<br>
driven by a simple wish to appear to know what's what.<br>
