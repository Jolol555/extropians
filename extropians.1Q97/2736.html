Robin Hanson writes (to Guru George):<br>
<i> &gt;What happened is that people were informed in more vivid detail</i><br>
<i> &gt;about the conditions of life of real slaves, which convinced them</i><br>
<i> &gt;that they didn't want to live in a state/nation/etc where those</i><br>
<i> &gt;sort of things happen to people.  Concrete facts were more persuasive</i><br>
<i> &gt;that abstract arguments about what is or is not "evil" in principle.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps libertarians should set up pen-pal relationships with people who<br>
are in prison for victimless crimes such as tax evasion, drug dealing,<br>
etc. That would give them something concretely unpleasant to talk about<br>
in vivid detail during their political arguments with their friends.<br>
I think that there are programs of this sort being run by various<br>
anti-Prohibition activist groups. Then there could be more annual<br>
memorials for the people who are shot and killed by law enforcement<br>
agents for no good reason. (Donald Cole? I'm having trouble remembering<br>
his name, and he didn't pop up in Altavista.)<br>
<p>
It just gets tiring having to keep concrete examples of the evils of<br>
the world in mind for the sake of winning arguments. But I guess if the<br>
nineteenth-century abolitionists put themselves through it...<br>
