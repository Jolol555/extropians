In response to my comments on avoiding offending people in order to build a <br>
stronger relationship with them, Lee Daniel Crocker said, "If I have to spend <br>
time thinking about everything I say in terms of how the other person might <br>
react--based on my limited knowledge of him or her--before I speak, and if I <br>
react with annoyance at what is said to me, in what way is that relationship <br>
healthy, strong, or beneficial?  Because the sex is good?  Because we don't <br>
kill each other?  Couldn't I have a relationship with those attributes, and <br>
that also served the goal of expanding our minds with unrestrained expression <br>
and criticism?  Must I condemn myself to a life of restraint among fragile <br>
waifs, or might I empower everyone at the small price of ruffling a few <br>
feathers?"<br>
<p>
Well, if you have limited knowledge of someone, then you don't have much of a <br>
relationship with them, healthy or otherwise.  In those cases when I don't <br>
know someone very well, I just assume they will be offended by the standard <br>
things that most people are offended by these days, and I am careful not to <br>
offend them if I am intending to have a good relationship with them.  As I get <br>
to know them, I am constantly adjusting the patterns of speech I use with them <br>
as I learn how they react to various ways of me saying things.  I develop a <br>
fairly distinct relationship with each individual I form a relationship with, <br>
and I adjust my ways of talking to people so that what I say has more closely <br>
the intended effect on them as an individual.  What areas they are sensitive <br>
to is just one small subset of the charachter profile I generate for each <br>
person I communicate with.  Other things on the profile are how much <br>
mathematics they know, so I know whether I can use mathematical metaphors to <br>
explain things with, or how intellectually inclined they are, so I know how <br>
complex I can make our conversations without losing them. <br>
<p>
If you find yourself among people who are offended when you are just honestly <br>
stating your opinion, then perhaps you need to hang around different people.  <br>
Why condemn yourself to "a life of restraint among fragile waifs", when you <br>
could simply choose different, more rational and tolerant company, where you <br>
could be quite uninhibited?  It's your choice.  But if you do choose to hang <br>
around people who get offended easily, it's hardly reasonable to demand that <br>
they change their emotional responses just to suit your prefrences.  <br>
<p>
I agree with you that it would probably make their lives more enjoyable to be <br>
more tolerant and rational, and it would certainly be nice if people didn't <br>
get offended so easily, but there are lots of people who *do* get offended <br>
easily.  That's just a fact of the world we live in.  I agree that it's <br>
irrational and self-destructive for them to be so easily offended, but <br>
nevertheless, these people exist, and we must choose how we will deal with <br>
them.  We can ignore their sensitivities and just say and do whatever the hell <br>
we want; that's certainly a legitimate option.  Or, we can take note of their <br>
difficulties and modify our actions accordingly, if it's not more trouble than <br>
it's worth.  If one wants to do *business* with someone who is easily <br>
offended, and that business relationship will be very lucrative, then it may <br>
be worth it to censor oneself around that person.<br>
<p>
I also prefer to hang around mature people who are not easily offended, and I <br>
share your desire that all people were like that so that I could say and do <br>
whatever the hell I wanted to without bothering anyone.  But the sad reality <br>
is, most people are very immature.  It is often easier to moderate my behavior <br>
around those people so that they will help me get what I want than to avoid <br>
them and try to get what I want without their help.<br>
