<i>&gt; For example, to many theists, I never let on that I don't really </i><br>
<i>&gt; believe in God.  In fact, I talk to them as though I *do* believe in </i><br>
<i>&gt; God, and I tell them how God wants us to learn as much as we can </i><br>
<i>&gt; and to improve ourselves as much  as we can.  I often get into it </i><br>
<i>&gt; more vigorously than their preacher does, explaining the scriptures </i><br>
<i>&gt; and Jesus' purpose and His message, and they're just nodding their </i><br>
<i>&gt; heads "Amen!", and their whole religion seems so much clearer to </i><br>
<i>&gt; them, and they feel so good, and all the while I've been putting a </i><br>
<i>&gt; subversive twist to their religion; I've turned their religion into </i><br>
<i>&gt; something that wants them to excell in their lives and to understand </i><br>
<i>&gt; their world better.  I get them so worked up and in such vigorous </i><br>
<i>&gt; agreement, that they can't forget the message I gave them, because </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've woven it right into their belief system.  </i><br>

Interesting.  Maybe, since Extropians are atheists, you pretend to be <br>
an atheist in your postings to the list, so you can weave your message <br>
into their belief system...  <br>
<p>
This is a dangerous and tricky game.  Of course I play similar games <br>
myself.  Anyone who has been on the list more than a few weeks <br>
knows of my love for leg-pulling and mindfucking.  But there is a <br>
fine line that one must be careful not to cross:  I will pull your leg <br>
all day long, but I won't lie to you or pretend to be something I'm not.  <br>
The difference is subtle but important.  <br>
