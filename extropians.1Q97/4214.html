<i>&gt; &gt;Remote outposts like Iceland were able to hold out for several</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more centuries.  I judge this to be due to the public goods nature</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of defense technologies and strategies, favoring centralization more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;on the Continent where there is greater exposure to invasion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and more dependence on fixed agriculture.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This implies that centralization in fact does do better at providing</i><br>
<i>&gt; public goods such as defense.  So future hope would have to be based</i><br>
<i>&gt; on changing this somehow by inventing better decentralized</i><br>
<i>&gt; institutions, or on less need for public goods in the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Our modern U.S. tax code stresses dependence on locale, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in the form of mortgage deductions.  This serves to keep subjects</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;vulnerably fixed, dependent on geographical jurisdictions to solve</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their defense problems.  With our transportation and communications</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;technologies, our mode of production of itself no longer stands in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the way of returnining to non-state law; indeed in the case of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Internet the application of geographical law is increasingly seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;as ludicrous.  The fixed vulnerability of industrial plant and rail is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;giving way to mobile capital, with political  institutions adapting at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;their typical excruciatingly slow pace.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh?  New high tech includes lots of relatively fixed capital.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; silicon valley were invaded today, do you think all the workers there</i><br>
<i>&gt; could carry away most of the local capital on their backs, and start</i><br>
<i>&gt; up anew somewhere else together without suffering much harm?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Much of the value of high tech industries lies in the minds of its<br>
employees and the software, data, and knowledge that they generate. (for<br>
example, most stock analysts say that half the value of Microsoft stock<br>
is representative of Bill Gates' brain's value) Seeing an invasion even<br>
a few hours away would enable Silicon Valley businesses to dump their<br>
mainframes onto systems at remote locations, and provided that their<br>
employees for the most part make it out with their brains intact, can<br>
rebuild their company with only minimal losses, possibly as little as a<br>
30-50% loss in value. The defensive advantage of less likely insurable<br>
intangible assets like brains and bytes is that they tend to be highly<br>
portable, while tangible capital assets like lithographic chipmaking<br>
devices and networks are highly insurable and thus easily replaceable as<br>
opposed to being not very portable. High tech industries can operate<br>
defensively in a scorched earth retreat strategy.<br>
<p>
While one chipmaking plant can cost upwards of $1 billion, keep in mind<br>
that the big three car makers each spend that every year on developing<br>
one new car model. While Intel and Mocrosoft are the big boys of high<br>
tech, keep in mind that they are no where near as valuable as GM or<br>
Ford.<br>
