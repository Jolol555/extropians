<p>
Sounds reasonable. A bit tricky, but possible. It even circumvents all <br>
bans on germ line modification, since you are using a clone (hmm, they <br>
have already been rendered void. Interesting). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; B) Grow just an arm or body part from specialized tissue cells ?</i><br>
<p>
Tricky, but probably what we really want. Growing entire clones is so <br>
wasteful (and bad taste), while finding ways to generate organs from <br>
scratch in vitro by controlled morphogenesis would be much more elegant. <br>
Hard to do, we need much more understanding of how cell differentiation <br>
occurs (as the clone experiments have shown, we certainly don't know all <br>
of the puzzle). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Genetical modification should be used to improve, not to degrade.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly. In one of the articles in Nature Axel Khan discussed the ethical <br>
principle Kant proposed: Human life should never be thought of as only a <br>
means, but also as an end. While I disagree a lot with Kant in general, I <br>
think this principle is quite sound. The trouble comes when defining what <br>
human life is; is a brainless clone human? An undifferentiated cell mass?<br>
<p>
Personally I would think bionic implants can do quite well in many <br>
situations too. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and about using animals for donor organs:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Shouldn't i be the one left to decide what i do with my genes to my animals</i><br>
<i>&gt; ? (as long as i don't cause that animal to suffer) In the Netherlands a</i><br>
<i>&gt; court ruled a bull had to be 'terminated' last year, because it was given a</i><br>
<i>&gt; human gene (which would increase milk production i believe). In the end</i><br>
<i>&gt; they just sterilized it and let it live. </i><br>
<p>
The current rush of condemnations of biotechnology all seem to boil down <br>
to that some loud people want to decide what is proper and what is not, <br>
and then force all life to conform to it. A *very* dangerous way of <br>
thinking - if you start to see certain trait as "unnatural" and hence <br>
undesirable, you can easily begin to play eugenic policeman.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It would surely be good for agriculture to allow modification, and maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; then those subsidies would finally end, opening the doors for a free world</i><br>
<i>&gt; market ?</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately the groups that currently do modifications are the big <br>
corporations; they of course thrive in a strictly regulated field since <br>
they can lunch with government officials and afford expensive security, <br>
labs and paperwork. In a less regulated field they would have more <br>
competition, but they would still be the biggest.<br>
