I said :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; HIV, the virus the government says causes AIDS.</i><br>
<p>
Davon C. Enigl said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Scientists...first said HIV causes AIDS, not "governments." ...The</i><br>
governments only<br>
<i>&gt;adopted what the scientists proved via the peer review process.</i><br>
<p>
Robert Gallo and his employer, the Department of Health and Human Services held<br>
a press conference on April 23, 1984, more than a week BEFORE Gallo's papers<br>
were to be<br>
printed in the journal Science.  The Secretary of HHS, Margaret Heckler,<br>
sponsored this<br>
huge event and introduced Gallo to the press.  Backed by the prestige of the<br>
government,<br>
she officially declared this virus was the probable cause of AIDS.  Before<br>
any paper had<br>
been published in a peer reviewed journal. Before any other scientist could<br>
review and <br>
comment on Gallo's claim, the government had decided the matter. Had other<br>
researchers <br>
been free to examine Gallo's papers for themselves, they might have pointed<br>
out that some of his AIDS patients had never been infected by the virus.<br>
They might have pointed out that no virus had been found in ANY of Gallo's<br>
AIDS patients, but only antibodies<br>
against it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Using Koch's postulates HIV was shown to cause AIDS. The "dissidents" have</i><br>
not shown<br>
<i>&gt;the contrary.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly.  Leading AIDS researchers have acknowledged that HIV fails Koch's<br>
postulates as the cause of AIDS.  For example: Gallo, R.C.,<br>
Virus-Hunting-AIDS, Cancer and the Human Retrovirus: A Story of Scientific<br>
Discovery, Basic Books, NY 1991; or Blatner, W.A., R.C. Gallo, and H.M.<br>
Temin. HIV causes AIDS. Science 241 (1988):514-515; or Weiss, R. and H.<br>
Jaffe. Duesberg, HIV and AIDS. Nature (London) 345 (1990) 659-660.<br>
Nevertheless, they have argued that the failure of HIV to meet Koch's<br>
postulates invalidates these postulates rather than invalidating HIV as the<br>
cause of AIDS.  For example, Gallo in his 1991 book said:<br>
<p>
"Rules were needed than, and can be helpful now, but not if they are too<br>
blindly followed.  Robert Koch, a great microbiologist, has suffered from a<br>
malady that affects many other great men: he has been taken too literally<br>
and too seriously for too long...Koch's Postulates, while continuing to be<br>
an excellent teaching device, are far from absolute in the real world<br>
outside the classroom." (Gallo, Virus-Hunting...page 277)<br>
<p>
But Koch's postulates consist of elementary logic.  Whereas technology is<br>
continually being outdated, logic is permanent.  Koch's rules, after all,<br>
simply restate the germ theory itself in experimental terms.  Gallo never<br>
tries to explain how logic would change over time, nor does Gallo offer any<br>
rigorous scientific rules to replace Koch's Postulates.  <br>
<p>
Koch's 1st postulate is that the microbe must be found in all cases of the<br>
disease.<br>
Robert Koch explicitly said a casual germ would be found in high<br>
concentrations in the<br>
patient and distributed in the diseased tissues. If HIV were actively<br>
infecting T-cells then cell-free virus particles, called virions, should be<br>
easily found circulating in the blood. This is the case with all classical<br>
viral diseases: Patients with Hepatitus B will have about 10 million free<br>
virus particles per milliliter of blood; Flu-like symptoms will appear only<br>
in the presence of 1 million rhinovirus particles per milliliter of nasal<br>
mucous. HIV, like other retroviruses, can achieve high levels of virus when<br>
first infecting the body (up to 100,000 particles per milliliter of blood),<br>
but in most people HIV is then permanently inactivated by the antibodies<br>
generated against it.<br>
<p>
Retroviruses do not typically kill their host cells.  In 1984, in Science,<br>
Gallo said HIV kills T-cells and that is the cause of AIDS. Yet HIV is grown<br>
in cultures of T-cells where, away from the antibodies to inhibit it, it<br>
reaches levels of 1,000,000 virus particles per milliliter without killing<br>
T-cells. If it doesn't kill T-cells then, how is it going to do it when it<br>
is suppressed to nearly undetectable levels by antibody?<br>
<p>
Pathogenic virus typically cause disease as a consequence of infecting,<br>
replicating in, and  killing more cells than a host can regenerate or spare.<br>
Complete proviral HIV has only been demonstrated in one in several thousand<br>
peripheral blood monocular cells (in both asymptomatic and symptomatic<br>
persons), and HIV RNA is detected in 1 tp 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 such cells<br>
(Simmonds et al., J. Virol. 64:864, 1990). Yet 5% of the body's<br>
T-cells are regenerated in the two days it takes HIV to establish an<br>
infection (Guyton,<br>
Textbook of Medical Physiology, 1987, WB Saunders, Phil.). <br>
<p>
Viruses typically cause disease shortly after infection, before the immune<br>
system of their host can respond. There is no other example of a viral<br>
pathogen which causes primary disease only after long and unpredictable<br>
latent periods, and only in the presence of neutralizing antibodies, as HIV<br>
is said to do.<br>
<p>
Koch's second postulate: The microbe must be isolated from the host and<br>
grown in culture. This postulate was designed to prove that a given disease<br>
was caused by a particular germ, rather than by some undetermined mixture of<br>
noninfectious substances. HIV has been isolated and is now grown<br>
continuously in HIV research labs. This rule therefore has technically<br>
fulfilled, but only in some instances.<br>
<p>
Since free virus is rarely found in AIDS victims, HIV can be retrieved only<br>
from the great majority of them by reactivating the latent form of the<br>
virus. Millions of white blood cells must be taken from the patient and<br>
grown in culture dishes for weeks, during which time chemical stimulants<br>
that shock cells into growing or mutating are added to awaken any dormant<br>
HIV from within its host cells. Given enough patience and plenty of<br>
repetition such procedure, a single intact virus can eventually be<br>
activated, at which point it starts infecting the remaining cultured cells.<br>
Yet even this powerful method does not yield active virus from many AIDS<br>
cases that have confirmed antibodies against HIV. <br>
<p>
Koch's third postulate: The microbe must reproduce the original disease when<br>
introduced into a susceptible host.  This condition can be tested in one of<br>
three ways: infection of laboratory animals, accidental and natural<br>
infection of humans, or by vaccination experiments. HIV fails all three<br>
tests. (data available upon request, check "Inventing the AIDS Virus" by<br>
Duesberg, page 182)<br>
<p>
Duesberg argues that AIDS is not infectious. Gallo and the CDC says it is.<br>
Based on common characteristics of all orthodox infections, infectious AIDS<br>
would be predicted to:<br>
<p>
1. Spread randomly between the sexes. <br>
2. Cause primary disease within weeks or months after infection, because<br>
infectious agents multiply exponentially in susceptible hosts until stopped<br>
by immunity. They are self-replicating, and thus fast-acting, toxins.  Slow<br>
pathogenicity by a neutralized virus has never been experimentally proven.<br>
3. Coincide with a common, active and abundant microbe in all cases of the<br>
same disease. (Inactive microbes or microbes at low concentrations are<br>
harmless passengers,e.g. lysogenic bacteriophages, endogenous and latent<br>
retroviruses, latent herpes, etc..  Hibernation is a proven microbal<br>
strategy of survival, which allows indefinite coexistence with the host<br>
without pathogenicity.)<br>
4. Lyse or render nonfunctional more cells than the host can spare of<br>
regenerate.<br>
5. Generate a predictable pattern of symptoms. <br>
<p>
By contrast noninfectious AIDS, caused by tozins, would be predicted to:<br>
<p>
1. Spread nonrandomly, according to exposure to toxins.<br>
2. Follow intoxication after variable intervals as determined by lifetime<br>
dosage and personal thresholds for disease. <br>
3. Manifest toxin- and intoxication-site-specific diseases, e.g., cigarettes<br>
causing lung cancer and alcohol causing liver cirrhosis.<br>
<p>
AIDS is incompatible with classical criteria of infectious disease:<br>
<p>
1. Unlike conventional infectious diseases, including venereal diseases,<br>
American/European AIDS is nonrandomly (90%) restricted to males, although no<br>
AIDS disease is male specific.<br>
2. HIV is said to cause AIDS only after a peculiar latent period.  There is<br>
no precedent for an infectious agent that causes primary diseases on average<br>
only 10 years after transfusion in adults and only after 2 years in<br>
children.  The diversity of these latent periods is inconsistent with one<br>
infectious agent and their magnitude is characteristic for diseases caused<br>
by chronic exposure to toxic substances.<br>
3. There is no common, predictable pattern of AIDS symptoms in patients of<br>
different risk groups.  Instead, different risk groups have their own<br>
characteristic AIDS diseases.<br>
<p>
In response to these arguments, Goudsmit, a proponent of the HIV AIDS<br>
hypothesis, confirmed "AIDS does not have the characteristics of an ordinary<br>
infectious disease.  This view is incontrovertible." (Goudsmit, J.,<br>
Alternative View on AIDS. Lancet 339 (1992):1289-1290.)  Likewise,<br>
epidemiologists Eggers and Weyer conclude that "the spread of AIDS does not<br>
behave like the spread of a disease that is caused by a single sexually<br>
transmitted agent." (Eggers, H.J. and J.J. Weyer. Linkage and independence<br>
of AIDS Kaposi disease: the interaction of HIV and some coagents. Infection.<br>
19(1991):115-122.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;HIV causes AIDS is scientifically supportable....</i><br>
<p>
HIV=AIDS violates many established principles of virology, including Kochs<br>
postulates and Farr's law.  You mention that you are a microbiologist.  When<br>
the government announced that HIV was the probable cause of AIDS, they said<br>
they would have a vaccine in 2 years.  A vaccine would give you antibody to<br>
HIV. Today, if I walk into a doctors office and test positive for antibody<br>
to HIV, it is bad news.  If the government developed a vaccine, and then I<br>
walked into a doctors office and tested positive for antibody, would that be<br>
good news or bad?  How would the doctor know if the antibody I had was from<br>
the vaccine (presumably good news), or the antibody that today is bad news?  <br>
