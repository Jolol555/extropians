With all due respect Greg, I think that you have a bit of denial here as<br>
to what Alife feels. Since we are simulating creatures of instinct,<br>
which react to stimuli, then, Alife has really no distinction from<br>
biolife. Animals merely react to input via sensory nerves as pre<br>
programmed by evolved instincts. There is absoulutely no difference,<br>
unless you are an adherent to the Gaia theology. What we are currently<br>
simulating is merely at the level of animals operating on their lizard<br>
evolved cortex, over time, being able to reach higher orders of<br>
simulation will eventually make us able to "simulate" human behavior and<br>
reasoning. At which point, A-Greg will debate with Greg over who is real<br>
and who is not real......<br>
