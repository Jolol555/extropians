My guess is that it isn't as hard as we think it is, while still rather <br>
tricky. The current experiments use trickery to get the quanta where we <br>
want them; in a QC we have to be sure that they stay there even when we <br>
aren't looking. Most likely hyperprecision isn't needed, quantum dots <br>
might do quite well. <br>

<p>
Well, at least it is anothe TLA. I wonder if QAI could make the old AI <br>
problems with huge search spaces manageable. <br>

Ouch! Ladies and gentlemen, this year both the Most Obscure In-Joke and<br>
the Worst Pun awards go to Eugene Leitl! <br>

Oh, I was just referring to the bulk NMR quantum bits discussed in<br>
Science. I'm completely innocent.<br>
