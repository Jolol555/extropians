<i>&gt;&gt;any questions?</i><br>
<p>
Rather an inflammatory list.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes.  We need more detail about these to evaluate their relevance.</i><br>
I think everybody here is passably familiar with these issues.  Enough so to<br>
say:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Specifically, we need to see that:</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. There are (at least) two communities, each aware of the other's views.</i><br>
<p>
True for all of the above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2. These views are relatively stable and substantially different.</i><br>
<p>
Also true.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3. These views reflect actual beliefs, not just verbal posturing.</i><br>
<p>
True for most believers, at least.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4. The dispute has lasted long enough so both sides know that </i><br>
<i>&gt;   both sides know that both sides know (etc.) ... that they disagree.</i><br>
<p>
True for all of the above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;5. Both sides see the issue as a dispute over fact, not values, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;   believe that the other side does as well.</i><br>
<p>
True for all of the above save Vietnam, abortion, and the Second Amendment,<br>
and partially true even for them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;6. We can't easily dismiss one group as small and primarily composed of </i><br>
<i>&gt;   people who are much more "cognitively broken" than most.</i><br>
<p>
The Holocaust controversies are the work of relatively small groups of kooks.<br>
 But most of these do indeed have large numbers of reasonably intelligent<br>
people on both sides.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;7. We can't easily dismiss the type of issue as exceptional in </i><br>
<i>&gt;   inducing "broken cognition" even in ordinary people.  </i><br>
<p>
Religion is the only "exceptional" item involved in these issues in that it<br>
obviously clouds otherwise reasonable people's minds.  But religions are<br>
important things, believed by most people in all societies I'm aware of.<br>
 It's exceptional in its effect, but the rule in its presence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is the sort of example needed to suggest that ordinary people in</i><br>
<i>&gt;ordinary contexts often have persistent disagreements contrary to</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bayesian expectations. </i><br>
<p>
All the literature on human reasoning I'm aware of indicates the people have<br>
many blatant errors in their reasoning, especially with respect to<br>
probabilities (particularly important to Bayesian inference, which is based<br>
on modifying probabilities of conflicting theories.)  What evidence is there<br>
that *any* people, never mind ordinary ones, act like good Bayesian agents,<br>
apart from in science?<br>
