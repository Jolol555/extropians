<p>
I think the cruicial word here is 'point' - the place has to be defined <br>
quite strictly, otherwise it will be useless. So the Schelling points <br>
will lie at the points defined by space geography or obvious interest - <br>
near rare and unique astronomical objects, or at places which for one <br>
reason or another are "pointed" out by their surroundings, like maybe the <br>
center of the rosette nebula. Planetary neubulas might work quite well <br>
as neighborhood points.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I offer a tentative answer:  The point where gravitational forces of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe sum to zero--galatic center, if you will.</i><br>
<p>
The next step is to make it clear where to go in the center. As Greg Bear <br>
eloquently describes in his novels, the center is a huge place with room <br>
for much wonder. You might want to set up some lighthouse or other sign <br>
to make beings gather.<br>
