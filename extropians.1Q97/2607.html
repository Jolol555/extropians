Damien Broderick wrote 2/13/97: &lt;Reilly's invocation of Gilson strikes me<br>
as odd in the extreme.  Gilson is a Catholic Aristotelian in the Thomist<br>
tradition.  BTW, I take it that Gregory's use of `ontotheological' reflects<br>
the influence of Heidegger or perhaps Derrida?&gt;<br>
<p>
Odd in what way I wonder?  Perhaps odd because I'm quoting a Frenchman?  (I<br>
won't use your term invocation here because Gregory may get confused and<br>
think I'm guilty of liturgical cognition or some such horrible thought<br>
crime.)  Well, I do want to be fair to the French, and if some of them come<br>
up with a correct analysis, I will not look askance.  I find Gilson's<br>
comment about Heidegger and his fellow-traveler crudballs to be<br>
particularly apt:  "Philosophy always buries its undertakers."<br>
<p>
Although the "bad" Frenchman Gilles Deleuze is not in the same intellectual<br>
league with "good" Frenchmen like Montaigne, Pascal, Montesquieu, Condorcet<br>
or DeTocqueville, I would even quote him if could analyze his way out of a<br>
paper bag.  In fact, I will quote him on something reasonably truthful,<br>
I'll just wash my hands after I type this:  <br>
<p>
"It is precisely its impotence that makes power so dangerous.  This,<br>
precisely, is the fourth danger:  the line of flight crossing the wall,<br>
getting out of the black holes, but instead of connecting with other lines<br>
and each time augmenting its valence, *turning to destruction, abolition<br>
pure and simple, the passion of abolition*." - from "Capitalism and<br>
Schizophrenia" Vol. II<br>
<p>
The reason power is always impotent is because power cannot answer the<br>
question "Power to do what?"  The passionate capacity for entropic<br>
death-worshipping is in us, and will be in our successors (if they are<br>
higher, rather than lower, on the evolutionary scale).  It is a choice open<br>
to beings with free will, inherent in the design of things.  There will<br>
always be entities who will choose it, simply to exercise their free will,<br>
to show others their independence if for no other reason.<br>
<p>
Gregory has whined utopically about how bad it is to develop violent<br>
technology:  &lt;I believe violence in general, and specifically science for<br>
the purpose of violence would be greatly reduced if we included emotive<br>
education in our schools.&gt; and &lt;Though the person focused on truth can<br>
rationalize violence as irrational, that person is more likely to be<br>
violent and to participate in the creation of violent technology because<br>
that person does not have the same control over his/her emotions as the<br>
person focused on usefulness.&gt;<br>
<p>
The act of turning towards extropy or turning towards entropy is a moral<br>
absolute.  Those who have turned towards extropy, or the culture of life,<br>
must defend themselves from those who have turned towards entropy, or the<br>
culture of death.  An entirely extropic vocation is to specialize in<br>
development of superior violent technology to prohibitively raise the cost<br>
of action to those who would destroy what one loves.  For a modern course<br>
in what prevents war, see John Keegan's "A History of Warfare" (1993). <br>
"Peace Through Strength" is a better bumper sticker than "Visualize World<br>
Peace."  Letting those with a "passion for abolition" have their way with<br>
you by renouncing the development of violent technology coupled with the<br>
shown will to employ it, is to be co-opted by the entropic<br>
death-worshippers by default.  It would not be, shall we say, rational.<br>
