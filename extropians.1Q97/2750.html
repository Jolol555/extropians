I would guess that some PPAs would offer the situation you originally<br>
thought, and others would offer the one you understand Friedman to<br>
describe. Unless one or the other business decision proved so<br>
successful as to become standard on the market.<br>
<p>

Kaiser and AAA both use membership cards. Alcor uses ID bracelets<br>
or necklaces. Why are you imagining that the identifications need<br>
to be blazoned out for all the public to see at a distance? Maybe<br>
if the BATF was providing protective services for its employees,<br>
but I don't see why this would be necessary for peaceful PPAs<br>
interested in turning a profit.<br>
<p>
(For non-Californians, Kaiser is a big hospital corporation that<br>
provides medical care mostly to employees of large organizations<br>
in California, and for non-Yanks, AAA is a automobile club that<br>
provides emergency road services to its members. The government<br>
runs neither one, and AAA functions as a "reseller" of government<br>
registration and licensing services in California, with great<br>
success and customer satisfaction. Though the government might as<br>
well be running Kaiser, considering how intensely the gaze of the<br>
Central Scrutinizer falls upon it.)<br>
