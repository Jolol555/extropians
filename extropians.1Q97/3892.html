In Ch.3 of _Life Itself_ Robert Rosen descends to the "epistemological<br>
basement", examining the basic dualisms of self (or observer) and other<br>
(what he calls "ambience"), which is then partitioned into system &amp;<br>
environment, and asserts that, even this, is a "fateful step [where]<br>
fundamental trouble begins to creep in."=20<br>
<p>
3B, "The First Basic Dualism": "Science is built on dualities. Indeed,<br>
every mode of discrimination creates one. But the most fundamental<br>
dualism, which all others presuppose, is of course the one a<br>
discriminator makes between self and everything else.... At any rate, =<br>
we<br>
know our self with ultimate certainty, even though this knowledge is<br>
subjective ... What else is there? Whatever it is, I shall call it the<br>
/ambience/.... this is the external world, the world of objective<br>
reality, the world of phenomena.... Science, in fact, requires both; it<br>
requires an external, objective world of phenomena, and an internal,<br>
subjective world of the self, which perceives, organizes, acts and<br>
understands."<br>
<p>
3C, "The Second Basic Dualism": "Our second basic dualism concerns the<br>
way we partition our ambiences, the way we manage our perceptions of =<br>
the<br>
external world.... It rests on a consensus /imputed/ to the ambience =<br>
...<br>
It is the dualism between systems and their environments.... The<br>
partition of ambience into system and environment ... is a basic though<br>
fateful step for science.... Systems and environments are thenceforth<br>
perceived in entirely different ways ... system gets described by =<br>
states<br>
... environment is characterized rather by its effects on system.<br>
Indeed, it is precisely at this point that, as we shall see, =<br>
fundamental<br>
trouble begins to creep in; already here."<br>
<p>
3D, "Language": "An essential part of the inner world of any self is<br>
one's language.... Language itself creates, or embodies, new dualism =<br>
...<br>
The first basic dualism inherent in language is that (1) it is a thing<br>
in itself and (2) permits, even requires, referents external to itself.<br>
These embody respectively what we call the syntactic aspects of =<br>
language<br>
and its semantic aspects... Syntax involves its own inherent dualism =<br>
...<br>
between proposition and production rules.... The syntactical production<br>
rules of a language are its internal vehicles for what I shall call<br>
inferential entailment.... We shall understand by a formalism any such<br>
'sublanguage' of a natural language, defined by syntactic qualities<br>
alone. That is, a formalism is a finite list of production rules,<br>
together with a generating family of propositions on which they can =<br>
act,<br>
without any specification or consideration of extralinguistic<br>
referents.... As we shall see, the extraction of a formalism from a<br>
natural language has many of the properties of extracting a system from<br>
the ambience.... The idea of formalization, that the semantic aspects =<br>
of<br>
language can always be effectively replaced by purely syntactic ones,<br>
will turn out to be another place where really serious trouble creeps<br>
in."<br>
<p>
Rosen concludes this section "by pointing out two aspects of natural<br>
language that will play key roles in what follows but that never end up<br>
as part of formalisms. These are (1) the use of the interrogative ...<br>
and (2) the use of the imperative.... imperatives constitute recipes,<br>
protocols, blueprints, and the like, which govern /fabrication/. But, =<br>
as<br>
will become apparent, the entailment process /embodied/ by algorithms =<br>
or<br>
recipes is very different than that governing their /application/. The<br>
difference, indeed, is precisely the difference between fabrication and<br>
physiology."<br>
<p>
3E, "On Entailment in Formal Systems". Rosen proposes: "suppose that we<br>
step outside our formalism and contemplate one of its theorems P....<br>
<i>&gt;From that perspective, we can interrogate ... we can ask: why is P true</i><br>
in the system?" Rosen proposes three operations we can perform on such =<br>
a<br>
system: "We can change an axiom, without touching the inferential rules<br>
... We can change an inferential rule, without changing either the<br>
axioms or the list of which that constitutes our algorithm. Finally, we<br>
may change the algorithm, without affecting either the axioms or the<br>
rules themselves.... the kinds of changes we have contemplated all come<br>
from outside the formalism ... from the standpoint of the formalism,<br>
anything that happens outside is accordingly unentailed.... This is our<br>
first glimpse of a peculiar thing ... namely, that though formal =<br>
systems<br>
allow us to talk about entailment in a coherent way, from their<br>
standpoint everything important that affects them is itself =<br>
unentailed."<br>
<p>
<p>
Rosen says that this discussion should remind us of Aristotle: "we have<br>
paralleled three of his four categories of causation; specifically, if<br>
we call theorem P an /effect/, we may identify his idea of material<br>
cause of P with the axioms of a formalism, his idea of efficient cause<br>
of P with its production rules, and his idea of formal cause of P with<br>
the specification of a particular sequence or algorithm of production<br>
rules.... The reader may not be surprised to note that we do not see a<br>
formal analog of Aristotle's fourth causal category, which he held to =<br>
be<br>
the most significant; namely, the category of final cause.... In any<br>
formalism, there is a kind of natural flow from axioms to theorems, =<br>
very<br>
much like the familiar unidirectional flow of time.... The three<br>
'traditional' causal categories (formal, material, and efficient<br>
causation) always respect this flow of 'formal time' ... Final =<br>
causation<br>
gives the /appearance/, at any rate, of violating this flow."<br>
<p>
3F. "On the Comparison of Formalisms." Rosen argues that "mathematics,<br>
in the broadest sense, is the study of formalisms and that formalisms,<br>
in their turn, are parts of natural language." Rosen asks: "When does<br>
one formalism subsume another, so that the second can be in some sense<br>
generated from the first, or embedded in it? And above all, is the<br>
machinery for dealing with such questions, i.e., with the comparison of<br>
formalisms, itself a formalism?"<br>
<p>
Rosen goes on to discuss coordinate systems, transformations and<br>
modeling relations. Rosen notes: "In order to compare [two formalisms],<br>
we need to ... express what each formalism says to itself in the<br>
language of the other." We need a pair of dictionaries: an encoding<br>
dictionary and a decoding dictionary. If these can establish a modeling<br>
relation between the inferential structures of the two formalisms such<br>
that one is a model of the other and one is a realization of the other.<br>
<p>
Rosen's primary point here is that the encodings and decodings are<br>
unentailed within the formalisms themselves: "The comparison of two<br>
inferential structures ... thus inherently involves something outside<br>
the formalisms, in effect, a /creative act/, resulting in a new kind of<br>
formal object, namely the modeling relation itself. It involves /art/".<br>
<p>
3G. "Entailment in the Ambience: Causality". "The fundamental question<br>
for us, at this point, is the following: is there, in this external<br>
world, any kind of /entailment/, analogous to the inferential =<br>
entailment<br>
we have seen between propositions in a language or formalism? =<br>
Obviously,<br>
if there is not, we can all go home; science is not only impossible but<br>
also inconceivable."<br>
<p>
3H. "The Modeling Relation and Natural Law". Using models, Rosen says,<br>
"We can compare inferential entailment in a formal system with causal<br>
entailments, relating a bundle of phenomena that we extract from our<br>
ambience and identify as a natural system.... the causal entailments<br>
manifested by a natural system provide the orderliness required of the<br>
ambience. Inferential entailment in a formal system is a way of<br>
providing the orderliness required of the self. The act of bringing the<br>
two into correspondence ... is the articulation of the former within =<br>
the<br>
latter; it is in effect science itself.... It is not generally<br>
appreciated, especially by experimentalists ... that any measurement,<br>
however comprehensive, is an act of abstraction ... From this<br>
standpoint, it is ironic indeed that a mere observer regards oneself as<br>
being in direct contact with reality and that it is 'theoretical<br>
science' alone that deals with abstractions."<br>
<p>
3I. "Metaphor". Rosen continues: "This modeling relation between two<br>
natural systems N1, N2 is of the most profound importance; I shall call<br>
it analogy.... This is another way of seeing, what I alluded to =<br>
earlier,<br>
that reduction to a common set of material constituents is not the only<br>
way, nor even a very good way, of comparing natural systems.... As we<br>
have seen, the modeling relation is intimately tied up with the notion<br>
of prediction.... insofar as the entailment structure itself is =<br>
captured<br>
in a congruent model, we can actually, in a sense, pull the future of<br>
our natural system into the present.... A large part of the cost =<br>
imposed<br>
by Natural Law, in return for the benefit of prediction, lies in =<br>
finding<br>
the right encodings. But to what extent do we really need these<br>
encodings? Perhaps we can presume a little on Natural Law and get away<br>
without them.... This is the essence of /metaphor/: decoding without<br>
encoding ... Perhaps the most important for our purposes in the machine<br>
metaphor of Descartes ... It asserts that things about machines can be<br>
decoded into predictions about organisms ... Another one of enormous<br>
current importance ... is what may be called the open system<br>
metaphor.... [However] to proceed metaphorically in the above sense [we<br>
must remember that] by giving up encoding, we also give up<br>
/verifiability/ in any precise sense.... Hence the general =<br>
indifference,<br>
if not active hostility, manifested by empiricists to theory couched in<br>
metaphorical terms."<br>
