<i>&gt; &gt; Fraud is a felony, is it not? If so, the law in California clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; states that any deaths occuring during the the commission of a felony</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are to considered homicides. Ergo, charge the bastard with murder.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is no fraud here.  Fraud is:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the act of using deceit</i><br>
	In the face of scientific proof of his error, he refused to acknowledge<br>
he was wrong. Therefore, he was deceitful.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; to obtain</i><br>
<i>&gt; consent from someone to a proposal of yours that materially harms</i><br>
<i>&gt; them in some way.  </i><br>
<p>
	He proposed that the object was a UFO of huge proportions and that<br>
since Hale-Bopp was last here at the time of the Pharohs and Babylon, he<br>
claimed that the UFO was the mythical home planet of the gods referred<br>
to in Babylonian myths.<br>
<p>
That people have taken to studying these ancient texts and cribbed many<br>
of the religious practices from Babylon, including the practice of<br>
ritual drug induced suicide/homicide sacrifices is eirily similar to<br>
what was going on (esp. since the tower temple of Babylon, the Ziggurat<br>
was known in ancient Babylon as the Gate to Heaven, hint hint) I think<br>
that there is a major case to be made that he had a big hand in this<br>
whole thing.<br>
<p>
The lunatic made no proposals to anyone--he<br>
<i>&gt; wasn't selling tickets to the UFO, or telling anyone to kill himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He was just spouting entertaining nonsense.  Just plain lying is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; a crime.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If we jailed people for irresponsible speech, we reinforce the</i><br>
<i>&gt; illusion that most speech is responsible.  Every news report is biased,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and based on bad evidence, and should be suspect.  The pretense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; objectivity in the media does far more harm than a few kooks, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it causes our ability to spot the kooks to atrophy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Well, lets see, Texas is handing down some huge libel judgements against<br>
nationwide news journals, including TIME, Wall Street Journal, as well<br>
as the ABC-Food Lion case, etc...... Looks like lying IS criminal....<br>
