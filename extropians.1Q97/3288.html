<p>
umm, yeah... "government currencies"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; The perrenial problem has been the temptation to make lots</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; of currency, resulting in inflation.  They have to have the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; make some currency for each new participant, otherwise stagnation occurs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I think I mentioned how it worked.  If not, here it is.  When you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; register your business/service at the gvb(global village bank), they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; drop 50 nella into your account.  When they have 1000 people signed up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as service providers, they will put the businesses/services on their web</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; page.  Then, if you need a service you can look around, and then buy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; their service.  So, yes they do have the ability to issue the currency</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to the people.  Remember, this is purely fictional currency.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; material you can purchase is digital/intellectual property...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As described, this is precisely as fictional--no more, no less--than</i><br>
<i>&gt; ordinary national currencies.  There is no reason at all you couldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; use it to to buy and sell anything, just like all the other cybercash</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems on the net (there are several).  </i><br>
<p>
I guess this is true.  Have you gone to the page to check the stuff<br>
out?  I personally wouldn't use it to buy physical property, but I guess<br>
some people could.<br>
<p>
<p>
If you can sell a document, that<br>
<i>&gt; document can be a ticket for redeeming some tangible good, and so long</i><br>
<i>&gt; as there is a relatively fixed amount of currency, or an amount that</i><br>
<i>&gt; inflates at a predictable rate, a useful economy will result.  But as</i><br>
<i>&gt; long as issued volume (and therefore value) is controlled by a monopoly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that monopoly has incentive to inflate.</i><br>
<p>
OK, please forgive my ignorance.  How exactly does inflation work? <br>
Doesn't it have to do with the money supply or something like that? <br>
Also, doesn't it affect the prices of goods(ie: increase the cost),<br>
which in turns increases inflation?  which in turn increases cost,<br>
etc....  Or am I wrong about that?  I oppose government interference in<br>
the economy, however, I admit, I'm somewhat naieve on the theory behind<br>
it all.  I've read a little here and there, but I need to learn more. <br>
OK, so how does a monopoly benefit from inflation?  <br>
<p>
Now, reading that you said "so long as there is a relatively fixed<br>
amount of currency", I can reply: For each person going in, there is<br>
only 50 nella going into the account.  (however, there is a bonus for<br>
introducing other businesses.  I know, it sounds like a ponzi scheme now<br>
that I mention that, but is it really?)  Anyways, isn't that a<br>
relatively fixed amount of currency(the 50 nella)?  I apologize for<br>
asking so many questions, but I want to learn more, and asking questions<br>
is a good way to start.  I'll probably go search the web for some more<br>
in depth treatment, too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only honest, safe, truly capitalist way to issue currency is to set</i><br>
<i>&gt; it at a fixed value in tangible goods--say, grams of gold--issued by</i><br>
<i>&gt; competing private banks (like Hong Kong).  And of course, make sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you buy deposit insurance valued in currency of the beneficiary's</i><br>
<i>&gt; choice at loss, so that the insurance companies will keep the banks in</i><br>
<i>&gt; line for you.  Banks can still manipulate the money supply by doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; fractional-reserve tricks, but they can never go too far without risking</i><br>
<i>&gt; their promise to redeem in hard goods.</i><br>
<p>
I know that's exactly the problem in America.  The FED is a<br>
fractional-reserve system, isn't it?  Also, ever since the Fed has been<br>
in existence, we've lost our gold standard, correct?  Hong Kong still<br>
works on the gold standard?  How well is their economy?  I know it works<br>
pretty well, but are they better off than Americans?  In general, are<br>
the average Hong Kong people more prosperous than the standard<br>
American(by average and standard, I mean middle class).  Also, how bad<br>
is poverty in Hong Kong?  If you don't know these things, that's fine. <br>
Just looking for more information.<br>
