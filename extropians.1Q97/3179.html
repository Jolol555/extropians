As usual, I have more ideas and opinions than free time to write<br>
them all down, but this present discussion of the pitfalls of the<br>
present design of hypertext systems brings up an issue I've been<br>
meaning to tackle in better detail, so I'll take a first pass now.<br>
The problem with creating the ideal hypertext system we imagine is<br>
not a technical one of backlinks and permanent storage, but a legal<br>
one: eliminate copyrights, and you eliminate the problem.<br>
<p>
First, the very idea of back-links is unworkable and must be<br>
abandoned.  Information providers want to, and have every right to,<br>
control precisely what they present to the consumer, down to the<br>
last pixel.  Freedom of speech is an inviolate human right.  As<br>
much as we might like to have all speakers subject themselves to<br>
critical review, there's no way we can force them.  The problem, then,<br>
is that if you want to express a refutation of an expressed point of<br>
view, how do you reference it? <br>
<p>
...The Vision<br>
<p>
Simple: include a snapshot of the other text in yours.  No need to<br>
worry that the other site might change, or that they may move; just<br>
copy those bytes onto your server and you're done.  He can then copy<br>
your bytes onto his server for counter-rebuttal, and so on.  Everybody<br>
gets to say everything he wants, counter every point made by the<br>
others, and each presents it all exactly the way he wants.  Since the<br>
providers are each using only their own resources, they are not<br>
dependent in any way on the other sites, or other parts of the net.<br>
Each has complete individual freedom and individual responsibility.<br>
<p>
How does the consumer find these refutations?  That's easy: because<br>
he /wants/ to find them, they are valuable.  Consumer attention is a<br>
precious commodity, as the experience of traditional media should have<br>
taught us.  Information providers will find means to advertise their<br>
information to the consumers who want it, because it will pay them to<br>
do so.  Whatever mechanism the market demands--whether it be search<br>
engines, push-channels, ordered indexes--that will be what the market<br>
provides.  The individual info-merchant is still free to reject the<br>
standards if he wants, and free to tailor his presentation, but he is<br>
still bound by the supply and demand of consumer attention.<br>
<p>
The more and more people who produce information, the more valuable<br>
becomes /selection/, /evaluation/, and /collection/ of the kinds of<br>
information the consumer wants.  That will be the hot-ticket item in<br>
the information economy: not the information itself, but the work of<br>
collecting it, sorting it, and bringing consumer attention to it.<br>
Those who are best at collecting the kind of information I want will<br>
get more if my attention, and will therefore be more profitable.  The<br>
exact details of how the consumer will sell his attention aren't that<br>
critical: advertising is certainly the most obvious, but direct<br>
sponsorship of information selectors is another.  The TV medium uses<br>
both models well.  Broadcasts are paid by advertisers, specialty<br>
cable channels by subscribers who want specially selected programs.<br>
There is no reason to think both models won't work on the Net.  For<br>
general searching, I'll settle for free sites like Yahoo! with ads.<br>
For more detailed information, I might want to subscribe to a service<br>
that provides special content, reviews, etc.<br>
<p>
...The Catch<br>
<p>
What prevents all the info-selectors from using all the information<br>
from any source they can find is copyright law: the idea that if you<br>
didn't "create" the information (leaving alone for the moment what <br>
that means, exactly), you can't present it, even if you make no claim<br>
to have created it.  You can't modify it, translate it, change media,<br>
add commentary to it, or do anything else (other than the extremely<br>
limited "fair use") without the "creator"'s permission.  Those who<br>
"create" information (I'll leave off the scare quotes from now on, but<br>
don't assume that I have conceded that info creator is an objectively<br>
definable thing) have complete control of it, even its manifestation<br>
in other minds or other media.<br>
<p>
It is not legal, therefore, to copy an essay onto your server for the<br>
purpose of refuting it; you must instead reference it by pointing to<br>
the author's chosen means of presentation.  If the author chooses only<br>
to sell paper, then you cannot put his words online.  If he chooses not<br>
to link back to you, then your link to him will be one way only.  In<br>
any case, your ability to make your point about his words is crippled.<br>
<p>
...The Excuses<br>
<p>
Copyrights are justified by claiming that authors would have no<br>
financial incentive to create works without it.  They create the<br>
legal category of "intellectual property", and treat the use of<br>
information like the use of real property.<br>
<p>
It is true that "property rights" are a man-made concept, and the<br>
concept can be applied to intangible things like names, contractual<br>
privileges, etc.  But the concept was created for dealing with a<br>
concrete, objective fact of existence: scarcity.  If I "use", say,<br>
an apple, I have thereby prevented anyone else from using that<br>
apple.  An idea, say, "apples are edible", is different.  If I use<br>
this idea, I in no way prevent others from using it.  Likewise, if<br>
I choose to give my neighbor this idea, I still have every bit of it<br>
that I had before I gave it to him.  If I give him a real apple, I<br>
no longer have it.  Names and privilege /are/ scarce: if I knowingly<br>
use my neighbor's good name to defraud another, I have materially<br>
harmed his ability to use that same name, by damaging the trust he<br>
has established with others.  If I give a privilege--say concert<br>
tickets--to another, I can no longer go.  But information itself is<br>
not scarce in this way.<br>
<p>
Because there is this real, objective difference between physical<br>
property and ideas, our use of the concept of property rights on one<br>
does not necessarily imply that they should be used for the other--<br>
especially since the motivation for the creation of property rights<br>
is precisely that difference--scarcity.  Yet still, the rhetoric of<br>
itellectual property still uses real property words: presenting<br>
someone else's information--even with full credit--is called "theft",<br>
because we have defined it as such. <br>
<p>
There is a sense in which intellectual property does protect a<br>
scarce commodity, but it is not the ideas themselves, but rather the<br>
market for them.  If Fred writes a book, and John copies it and sells<br>
the copy (honestly, i.e. without claiming that it is original), then<br>
the market for Fred is reduced.  But this is precisely analagous to<br>
real property, for which we deny protection: if John sells apples<br>
from his orchard, he reduces the market for Fred's apples, but we do<br>
not grant either of them a legal monopoly just because he planted the<br>
first tree or made the first claim to the market.  We only protect<br>
Fred's and John's individual capacity to produce--not their capacity<br>
to sell--because that reduces competition and leads to an inefficient<br>
market.  Yet somehow we think Fred "deserves" his monopoly on the<br>
sale of his book, but not the sale of his apples.<br>
<p>
...The Refutations<br>
<p>
In a world without copyrights, Fred still has many ways to take<br>
advantage of the marketplace without our handing him a monopoly from<br>
day one.  (1) He will be first to market.  This is a tremendous<br>
advantage to any product in any industry, and because Fred continues<br>
to write, /every/ book he writes will be first to market. (2) He has<br>
sole right to his good name and consumer attention.  He can charge<br>
for autographs of his book, or charge for the privilege of answering<br>
questions about it, or joining a mailing list on it, and only he can<br>
sell "authorized" editions non-fraudulently. (3) He has his creative<br>
mind and knowledge of the subject.  He can charge for appearances<br>
and Q&amp;A sessions; he can sell preview-privileges to future works; he<br>
can sell his labor in adapting the book to other media (which he<br>
would presumably be better at than anyone else); he can even sell <br>
his writing skill to adapt other works ("Mr. King, could you write me<br>
a horror-movie screenplay for Gilligan's Island?").  (4) He can sell<br>
his consumer attention to other info-sources ("Max More's best of the<br>
net.").  (5) He can choose to withhold information, and only reveal<br>
it to those who sign volutary non-disclosure agreements.  There are<br>
probably many more.<br>
<p>
Without copyrights, every author simply uses whatever information he<br>
can get from any source; he doesn't need to bother with researching<br>
legal minutiae and filling pages with credits.  Schools can run books<br>
though the old Xerox instead of being extorted for $50 for Calculus<br>
texts that haven't changed in decades.  Software would evolve faster<br>
because everything could be reused (and distribution could still be<br>
controlled by cryptography and contracts).<br>
<p>
One might still object that even with the new methods of marketing<br>
and the newly lowered costs, it still would not be enough incentive<br>
for an author, or that it still seems immoral to sell another man's<br>
ideas.  But isn't that the situation now?  Isn't every story built on<br>
cultural foundations we can't possibly find all the sources of?  Why<br>
is it that Hank Aaron has to keep hitting home runs to make money,<br>
but the network who filmed #715 gets to keep making money on its one<br>
piece of camera work for years into the future?  And why must we<br>
encourage authors at the expense of others anyway?  Is an author<br>
somehow more "noble" or more "valuable" than a bookbinder that we<br>
deny the latter's right to earn an honest living for the benefit of<br>
the former?  How is that different from any other subsidy?<br>
<p>
Finally, in the hypertext world I imagined above, competition between<br>
info selectors for consumer attention would probably be so fierce that<br>
it would encourage them to seek authors that could create valuable<br>
content faster than their competitors, making good authors more valuable<br>
as both creators and as selectors.  They might even sign contracts<br>
with their competitors to respect each other's "exclusives" for their<br>
mutual benefit, thereby creating voluntary copyrights among themselves.<br>
<p>
...Conclusion<br>
<p>
I am convinced that copyrights are nothing but subsidies to authors,<br>
based on nothing more objective than snobbery and convention, and that<br>
an economy without them would be fairer, more efficient, and produce<br>
/more/ creative output, not less.  It would also go a long way toward<br>
solving the hypertext problem if there were no barriers to any<br>
presenter arranging others' works in new media without legal barriers,<br>
and if information presentation evolved an efficient market seperate<br>
from the one for information creation.<br>
