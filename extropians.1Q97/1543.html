&lt;&lt; <br>
<i> &gt;ON FURTHER INSECTION</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I THINK LYLE, IN THE VENUS POST IS SAYING THE SAME THING THE BEAUTY QUEEN</i><br>
<i> &gt;SAID:</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE</i><br>
<i> &gt;DON'T MESS AROUND WITH IT</i><br>
 <br>
 no he isn't. he keeps insisting his friend was all kinds of gods and icons<br>
 rather than who she was. Lyle has been known to lump groups of people<br>
 together before, and he's such a good writer I usually think he's just<br>
 kidding around, but this one is really bugging me. We're too enlightened to<br>
 think virgin/whore, it's mathemetician/sweetie-pie on this list.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
On further disection, you are probably right, i am not familiar with Lyle's<br>
modus opeRANTi - nevertheless, the post asserts that if she evolved<br>
intellectually she would become OTHER than she is and lose herself.<br>
[yeah he is rather good, that picture of his sweetie pie was rather<br>
mouthwatering, wasnt it? <br>
<p>
[ ; ) It's metaphor was like: God baked this perfect pastry, and if we add<br>
ONE more ingredient, ( in this case I suppose intellect) it would be ruined!]<br>
