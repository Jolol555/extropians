Well, this is interesting, because I've just been reading Maslow talking <br>
about "no crap therapy" and how effective it was in dealing with drug <br>
addicts:<br>
<p>
	"... the kind of experience that you are having here indicates<br>
	 that not only can people take honesty, but also that it may<br>
	 be very helpful, very therapeutic. It may move things faster.<br>
	 This is true even when the honesty hurts."[1]<br>
<p>
And I agree entirely. To me, a healthy relationship with someone is a<br>
relationship where we can both be honest with each other and neither has<br>
to pussy-foot around trying to avoid the other's psychological buttons. <br>
What is healthy about a relationship where people habitually lie to<br>
each other?<br>
<p>
True, I'm still careful about what I say to people who I don't know<br>
very well, but that's because dishonesty has become the standard in this<br>
society and I don't have much choice if I want to get along with <br>
people in general. But I'd much rather spend my time with people who<br>
are strong enough to deal with reality and will force me to do the same. I<br>
find such company extremely refreshing.<br>
<p>
In particular, if there's something about me that annoys someone I like,<br>
then I would like them to tell me so that I can fix it, not spend six<br>
months skirting around the issue so as not to "offend" me. That does<br>
include not being honest with them if they really dislike it, but having<br>
to do so will dramatically lower my opinion of them.<br>
