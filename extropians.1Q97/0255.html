Michael Lorrey said, "I myself am not sure if I want to upload until I've had <br>
a fairly good view of the rest of the universe first, so I really would like <br>
to do my explorations in the flesh first."<br>
<p>
Michael, Michael.... You're not thinking this uploading thing through.  As an <br>
upload, you can experience *everything* you experience in the flesh *and* a <br>
whole lot more.  If you want to explore the physical universe, just create <br>
sensors which will inform you of whatever aspects of the universe you are <br>
interested in. There is no reason to encase oneself in a virtual bubble in the <br>
uploaded realm, with no links to the rest of the physical world.  One can be <br>
an upload and still control robots and use all kinds of different sensors.  <br>
The difference is that one could have ones' sensors and action machines <br>
scattered all over the place, instead of located near each other like we have <br>
now, with our bodies.  One could even create a robot that would provide one <br>
with the same range of sensory experiences and action capabilities that our <br>
current bodies provide us with.  The crucial difference is that if that robot <br>
gets destroyed, you are still alive, and you can build another one.  You could <br>
actually build several flesh-like robots and operate them all simultaneously.<br>
<p>
One idea that I find interesting is to build billions of various kinds of <br>
probes and scatter them around the world, with one's mind linked to all of <br>
them, so that you could keep a general watch on the whole planet and various <br>
other locations around the solar system and beyond, all at once.  Each probe <br>
would be small, self-repairing and self-reproducing.  Some or all will have <br>
the ability to manipulate their environments, so you could make changes to the <br>
world.  The probes, which communicate with each other, could also each have <br>
processors on board which carry out some of your cognitive processes.  You'd <br>
be a very distributed being, able to observe and act in many places at once.  <br>
Very hard to kill off.<br>
<p>
The possibilites for an upload are mind-boggling.  We have nothing to lose but <br>
our limitations.<br>
