Michael Lorrey said "... a meme's "capsule" is not separate from the content, <br>
they are homogenous." <br>
<p>
Actually, this isn't true.  The *content* of a meme is different than the <br>
*effect* it has on its host.  One cannot usually evaluate the "goodness" or <br>
"badness" of a meme, based only on the meme itself.  It must play itself out <br>
in a memetic environment of some sort that can host it, and the *effect* it <br>
has there will depend as much on the content of the meme itself as it does on <br>
the properties of the memetic environment.  Different minds will respond <br>
differently to the same memes.<br>
<p>
It is not easy to predict the effect a particular meme will have, the effect <br>
is contained within the meme itself only partially.  For example, the meme, <br>
"It is good to try new things." is difficult to evaluate.  Some hosts of this <br>
meme may try new things often, and this may help them develop a more flexible, <br>
adaptive and quick-learning mind.  Other hosts may take it too far and not <br>
develop strong skills in any particular areas.  The knowledge that using the <br>
meme would help one develop a better mind was not obvious from looking at the <br>
meme itself.  Before letting it play itself out, it is difficult to evaluate <br>
the meme as "good" or "bad".  And even then, the results can be far from <br>
clear, since it will affect everyone differently.<br>
