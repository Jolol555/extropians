<i>&gt;I've downloaded over 100 postings in the paleontology newsgroups</i><br>
<i>&gt;that dealt with predators and aquatic ape theory. All of them</i><br>
<i>&gt;spoke of a catlike predator (mostly mistaking lions and leopards</i><br>
<i>&gt;for having been around at the time) but none of them supplied the</i><br>
<i>&gt;name of the creature. I'm 90% sure any predecessor of panthera</i><br>
<i>&gt;genera couldn't have been around at lucy's time, and if it was, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;was in its infancy, far from the maneater modern lions and</i><br>
<i>&gt;leopards are.</i><br>
<p>
 I remember the T.V. series you spoke of, in fact, that series is<br>
being re-broadcast starting tonight here in Chicago (WTTW Channel<br>
11 9pm CST).<br>
<p>
 I called the Field Museum here to try and find out the name of<br>
your predator, but their "Top Gun" wasn't in, so they refered me to<br>
Gary Galbreath at Northwestern University.<br>
<p>
 Gary finished my opening sentence with "you mean the cave with the<br>
skulls with the leopard fang holes in them." uhh yea. He was 90%<br>
sure the cave was called Swarkarenz,(sp?) in South Africa, and<br>
there was a book/booklet writen about it by a C.K. Brain. It seems<br>
they were quite sure it was a "modern" leopard (There were modern <br>
bones in the cave). Anyway I hope this helps.<br>
<p>
 Even more interesting was that Gary told me there has been a<br>
recent find of one of what they believe is one of lucy's ancestors,<br>
it has been named Ardipithecus and the team that found it is<br>
keeping it pretty close right now.<br>
<p>
 I brought up the aquatic ape theory and Gary made the interesting<br>
point that modern apes and gorillias exhibit avoidance of open<br>
water, they often will drown in very shallow pools. He said that<br>
there were large areas of the central congo that appeared to offer<br>
excellent ape habitat but had never been occupied because of water<br>
barriers, even shallow narrow streams seem to do the trick.<br>
