<p>
Cost of an Integrated Circuit<br>
<p>
Why would a computer architecture book have a section on integrated<br>
circuit costs? In an increasingly competitive computer marketplace where<br>
standard parts -- disks, DRAMs, and so on -- are becoming a significant<br>
portion of any system's cost, integrated circuit costs are becoming a<br>
greater portion of the cost that varies between machines, especially in<br>
the high volume, cost-sensitive portion of the market. Thus computer<br>
designers must understand the costs of the chips to understand the costs<br>
of current computers. We follow here the American accounting approach to<br>
the costs of the chips.<br>
<p>
While the costs of integrated circuits have dropped exponentially, the<br>
basic procedure of silicon manufacture is unchanged: A _wafer_ is still<br>
tested and chopped into _dies_ that are packaged [...]. Thus the <br>
cost of a packaged integrated circuit is:<br>
<p>
<p>
                             Cost of die+Cost of testing die+Cost of pkgng.<br>
Cost of integrated circuit = ----------------------------------------------<br>
                                            Final test yield<br>
<p>
<p>
Cost of Dies<br>
<p>
To learn how to predict the number of good chips per wafer <br>
requires first learning how many dies fit on a wafer and then how to <br>
predict the percentage of those that will work. From there it is simple to <br>
predict cost:<br>
<p>
                         Cost of wafer<br>
Cost of die = ----------------------------------------<br>
                    Dies per wafer * Die yield<br>
<p>
The most interesting feature of this first term of the chip <br>
cost equation is its sensitivity to die size, shown below.<br>
<p>
The number of dies per wafer is basically the area of the wafer <br>
divided by the area of the die. It can be more accurately estimated by<br>
<p>
                 \pi * (Wafer diameter/2)^2   \pi * wafer diamtr.   Test<br>
Dies per wafer = -------------------------- - ------------------- - dies per<br>
                         Die area             \sqrt{2 * Die area}   wafer<br>
<p>
The first term is the ratio of wafer area (\pi r^2) to die area. The <br>
second compensates for the "square peg in a round hole" problem -- <br>
rectangular dies near the periphery of round wafers. Dividing the<br>
circumference (\pi d) by the diagonal of a square die is approximately<br>
the number of dice along the edge. The last term is for test dies that<br>
must be strategically placed to control manufacturing. For example, a      <br>
15-cm (ca. 6-inch) diameter wafer with 5 test dies produces 3.14 * 225/4<br>
- 3.14*15/\sqrt{2} - 5 or 138 1-cm-square dies. Doubling the area -- the<br>
parameter that a computer designer controls -- would cut dies per wafer<br>
to 59.<br>
<p>
But this only give the maximum number of dies per wafer, and the critical<br>
question is what is the fraction of percentage of good dies on a wafer<br>
number, or the _die yield_. A simple model of integrated circuit yield<br>
assumes defects are randomly distributed over the wafer:<br>
<p>
                                Defects per unit area * Die area<br>
Die yield = Wafer yield * ( 1 + -------------------------------- ) ^ - \alpha<br>
                                           \alpha<br>
<p>
where _wafer yield_ accounts for wafers that are completely bad and so<br>
need not be tested and \alpha is a parameter that corresponds roughly to<br>
the number of masking levels critical to die yield. \alpha depends upon<br>
the manufacturing process. Generally \alpha = 2.0 for simple MOS<br>
processes and higher values for more complex processes, such as bipolar<br>
and BiCMOS. As an example, wafer yield is 90%, _defects per unit area_<br>
is 2 per square centimeter, and die area is 1 square centimeter. Then die<br>
yield is 90% * (1 + (2 * 1)/2.0)^{-2.0} or 22.5 %.<br>
<p>
The bottom line is the number of good dies per wafer, which comes from<br>
multiplying dies per wafer by die yield. The examples above predict<br>
138*.225 or 31 good 1 cm-square dies per 15 cm wafer. As mentioned above,<br>
both dies per wafer and die yield are sensitive to die size -- doubling<br>
die area knocks die yield down to 10% and good chips per wafer to just<br>
59*.10, or 6! Die size depends on the technology and gates required by<br>
the function of the chip, but it is also limited by the number of pins<br>
that can be placed on the border of a square die.<br>
<p>
A 15-cm-diameter wafer processed in two-level metal CMOS costs a<br>
semiconductor manufacturer about $550 in 1990 [fresh numbers, anybody?].<br>
The cost for a 1-cm-square die with two defects per square cm on a 15-cm<br>
wafer is $550/(138*.225) or $17.74.<br>
<p>
What should a computer designer remember about chip costs? The<br>
manufacturing process dictates the wafer cost, wafer yield, \alpha, and<br>
defects per unit area, so sole control of the designer is die area. Since<br>
\alpha is usually 2 or larger, die costs are proportional to the third<br>
(or higher) power of the die area:<br>
<p>
  Cost of die = f (Die area^3)<br>
<p>
The computer designer affects die size, and hence cost, both by what<br>
functions are include on or excluded from the die an by the number of<br>
I/O pins.<br>
<p>
<p>
Cost of Testing Die and Cost of Packaging<br>
<p>
Testing is the second term of the chip-cost equation, and the success<br>
rate of testing (die yield) affects the costs of testing:<br>
<p>
                       Cost of testing per hour * Average die test time<br>
Cost of testing die = ---------------------------------------------------<br>
                                          Die yield<br>
<p>
Since bad dies are discarded, die yield is in the denominator in the<br>
equation -- the good must shoulder the costs of thesting those that fail.<br>
Testing costs about $150 per hour in 1990 and die test take about 5 to 90<br>
seconds on average, depending on the simplicity of the die and the<br>
provisions to reduce testing time included in the chip. For example, a<br>
$150 per hour and 5 seconds to test, the die test cost is $0.21. After<br>
factoring in die yield for a 1-cm-square die, the costs are $0.93 per<br>
good die. As in second example, let's assume testing takes 90 seconds.<br>
The cost is $3.75 per untested die and $16.67 per good die. The bill so<br>
far for our 1-cm-square die is $18.67 to $34.31, depending on how long it<br>
takes to test. These two testing-time examples illustrate the importance<br>
of reducing testing time in reducing costs.<br>
<p>
Cost of Packaging and Final Die Yield<br>
<p>
The cost of a package depends on the material used, the number of pins,<br>
and the die area. The cost of the material used in the package is in part<br>
determined by the ability to dissipate power generated by the die. For<br>
example, a _plastic quad flat pack_ (PQFP) dissipating less than one<br>
watt, with 208 of fewer pins, and containing a die up to one cm on a side<br>
costs $3 in 1990. A ceramic _pin grid array_ (PGA) can handle 300 to 400<br>
pins and a larger die with more power, but it costs $50. In addition to<br>
the cost of the package itself is the cost of the labor to place a die in<br>
the package and the bond the pads to the pins. We can assume that costs<br>
$2. Burn-in exercises the packaged die under power for a short time to<br>
catch chips that would fail early. Burn-in costs about $0.25 in 1990<br>
dollars.<br>
<p>
We are not finished with costs until we have figured in failure of some<br>
chips during assembly and burn-in. Using the estimate of 90% for final<br>
test yield, the successful must again pay for the cost of those that<br>
fail, so our costs are $26.58 to $96.29 for the 1-cm-square die.<br>
<p>
While those specific costs estimates may not hold, the underlying models<br>
will. [...] shows dies per wafer, die yield, and their product against<br>
the die are for a typical fabrication line, this time using programs that<br>
more accurately predict die per wafer and die yield. [...] plots the<br>
change in in area and cost as one dimension of a square die changes.<br>
Changes to small dies make little cost differences, while 30% increases<br>
to die size can double costs. The wise silicon designer will minimize die<br>
area, testing time, and pins per chip and understand the costs of<br>
projected packaging options when considering using more power, pins, or<br>
area for higher performance.<br>
<p>
<p>
Cost of a Workstation<br>
<p>
To put the costs of silicon in perspective, [...] shows the approximate<br>
costs of components in a 1990 workstation. Costs of a component can be<br>
halved going from low volume to high volume; here we assume high-volume<br>
purchasing of 100 000 units. While costs for units like DRAMs will surely<br>
drop over time from those in [...], units whose prices have already been<br>
cut, like displays and cabinets, will change very little.<br>
<p>
The processor, floating-point unit, memory-management unit, and cache are<br>
only 12% to 21% of the cost of the CPU board in [...]. Depending on the<br>
options included in that system -- number of disks, color monitor, and so<br>
on -- the processor components drop to 9 % and 16 % of the cost of a<br>
system, as [...] illustrates. In the future two questions will be<br>
interesting to consider: What costs can an engineer control? And what<br>
costs can a computer engineer control?<br>
