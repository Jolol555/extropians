Forrest Bishop writes (on the transhuman list):<br>
<i>&gt;Colliding binary neutron stars may provide a hefty element of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Great Filter".  An article in the April, 1997 issue of *Astronomy*</i><br>
<i>&gt;magazine reports astrophysicists theorise that these events produce</i><br>
<i>&gt;the gamma ray bursters, and goes on to say that "in Milky Way-like</i><br>
<i>&gt;galaxies, such explosions would destroy advanced life on every nearby</i><br>
<i>&gt;Earth-like planet on the average every 100 million years."  Nearby is</i><br>
<i>&gt;implied to be between 1500 and 3000 light years. </i><br>
<p>
This is a compelling image, but I don't quite understand how this could wipe<br>
out.  Gamma-ray bursts are very brief events and planets are excellent<br>
gamma-ray shields.  The burst would sterilize half the planet but the other<br>
half would be unaffected.  This is far less damage than the end-Cretaceous<br>
meteor strike, which killed all large animal species on the planet.  I<br>
suppose ther could be atmospheric effects from decomposing tissue, but<br>
offhand this seems like it wouldn't be enough.<br>
