After a discussion with a good friend of mine who is a classical <br>
scholar, we both hit the books and the Web and compiled a basic <br>
report on Hypatia of Alexandria.  Even restricting the search to original <br>
sources and chronologies yielded some contradictions.  I will begin with <br>
the basically agreed-upon facts:<br>
<p>
Hypatia of Alexandria (375 AD - 415 AD) was born, educated and lived <br>
in Alexandria under the reign of Emperor Arcadius, probably as a Roman <br>
citizen of Greek ancestry.  Her father, Theon, was himself a mathematician <br>
and philosopher and is remembered as the last head of the museum at <br>
Alexandria.  Her abilities emerged early, and, as Socrates <br>
Scholasticus states in his _Ecclesiastical History_, she achieved <br>
"such attainments in literature and science as to far surpass all the <br>
philosophers of her own time".  Her work seems to have focused on <br>
mathematics, astronomy and philosophy.<br>
<p>
In Damascus' _Life of Isodore_, we read that Hypatia would don her <br>
philosopher's cloak and walk the streets of Alexandria providing <br>
public commentary on the works of Plato, Aristotle, and other <br>
thinkers.  Her acumen and bold personality, combined with her teaching <br>
ability, established her reputation as both an intellectual and a public <br>
figure.  She became known as a leading proponent of the neo-Platonist <br>
philosophy that fueled pagan opposition to Christian influence.  <br>
<p>
Her known works include:<br>
	A commentary on the Arithmetic of Diophantes<br>
	A Commentary on the Conics of Apollonius<br>
	The Astronomical Canon<br>
	editor of Theon's Commentary on the Almagest of Ptolemy<br>
	(I found a reference calling her Mother of Algebra, but it<br>
		led nowhere)<br>
<p>
Now, on to the murkier aspects, including accounts of her death:<br>
<p>
Damascus states that she married the philosopher Isodorus, but he <br>
also claims that she remained chaste and "always a virgin".  He also <br>
praised her natural charm and power over men, telling an amusing <br>
story of how she cut short the affections of a besotted student by <br>
showing him her menstrual cloths.  Other accounts claim that she <br>
healed a self-inflicted cut on the same student's leg and cured him <br>
of her.<br>
<p>
The events leading up to her murder involve the complex politics and <br>
conflicts between the rising Christians and the pagans/Jews who <br>
resisted.  The key player, and the one who clearly instigated her death, <br>
is Cyril, Patriarch and Bishop of Alexandria.  The three main accounts <br>
agree that Cyril envied Hypatia's influence in Alexandria, as evidenced by <br>
the gatherings at her home and her friendship with the governor, who <br>
ceased to attend Christian church.  In his _Chronicle_, John, Bishop <br>
of Nikiu, writes:  "she beguiled many people with her Satanic wiles."<br>
<p>
The accounts Scholasticus and Bishop John indicate that Hypatia's <br>
influence was blamed for the non-resolution of a political dispute <br>
between Bishop Cyril and the prefect Orestes.  Scholasticus: "it was <br>
caluminously reported to the Christian populace that it was she who <br>
prevented Orestes from becoming reconciled to Cyril."  Bishop John's <br>
account provides a detailed chronology of the dispute, but the <br>
passages are so invective towards the Jews that I hesitate to <br>
reproduce it here.<br>
<p>
One evening, when Hypatia was traveling by carriage through the <br>
city, probably after a public meeting, she was dragged out of her <br>
carriage by a mob of angry Christians (might have been clerics, might <br>
have been mercenaries).  At this point the two original accounts of <br>
her death differ.  Scholasticus relates that she was taken to a <br>
church called Caesurum, stripped naked, and murdered with tiles of <br>
some sort.  The Greek word he used is 'ostrakois', meaning either <br>
brick roofing tiles or oyster shells.  Bishop John relates that she <br>
was taken from her carriage, stripped naked, and dragged through the <br>
streets of Alexandria until she died.  Both accounts agree that her <br>
remains were burned in a place called Cinaron.<br>
<p>
Bishop Cyril's assessment of Hypatia:  "an iniquitious female who had <br>
even presumed, against God's commandments, to teach men."<br>
