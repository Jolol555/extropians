Steganography is the art of hiding encrypted messages in naturally<br>
"noisy" data... GIF images, for instance. One implementation is<br>
discussed at <a href="http://www.fqa.com/ezstego/">http://www.fqa.com/ezstego/</a><br>
<p>
The trick you were discussing about generating final cyphertext that<br>
masqueraded as the .EXE object file format of MS DOS was an example of<br>
a rather specialized form of steganography. There's a potential fax<br>
effect here... as more people use more and more different varieties of<br>
steganographic techniques (and more and more different encryption <br>
algorithms) the kind of surveillance that some people were suggesting is<br>
possible will become even more expensive... and it is *already* <br>
impossibly expensive.<br>
<p>
Anyone who is willing to self-educate, even if starting from scratch, <br>
should have zero trouble keeping their messages reasonably secure from <br>
government bodies after reading Schneier's book and poking around in a<br>
few choice places on the 'net, if they are willing to take the time to<br>
read and think critically about what they are reading. For serious<br>
stuff, of course, communications protocols (in the informal diplomatic<br>
sense, not the network programmer's sense) should be worked out in<br>
advance. Cryptographic and steganographic software are just the building<br>
blocks from which secure communications protocols are constructed.<br>
Anyone who understands this much, and is willing to spend the time<br>
studying the design and implementation of such protocols, shouldn't have<br>
much to worry about.<br>
<p>
Of course I was interested in John Clark's discussion of evidence as to<br>
how far in advance of the public academic cryptologic community the<br>
NSA had discovered differential and linear cryptanalysis. But once you<br>
introduce carefully designed steganographic protocols into the<br>
environment, the problem is no longer one of cryptanalysis, but rather<br>
of finding the messages you want to cryptanalyze, and this problem is<br>
getting harder all the time. The advent of the Web, a "broadcast" and<br>
"pull" medium, makes the job even harder. Messages stegged into a<br>
periodically updated GIF on a highly trafficked web page go out to<br>
thousands or millions of people, and there is no way to know which of<br>
those recipients are interested, not in the picture, but in the message<br>
hidden within it. So even SIGINT-style traffic analysis starts getting<br>
muddy.<br>
