<i>        &gt;&gt;Well that's a real nice start Eliezer, but you didn't complete it.         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Talking about "a symbol" won't do, I want you to explain "the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;symbol", after all, I didn't ask a general question but a very        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;specific one. So please explain all the information necessary for         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;the formation of the symbol  "definition".</i><br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;Eliezer:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I think it's a bit misleading, quoting only my quickie definition:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Definition (n):  An explanation intended to convey all information               </i><br>
<i>        &gt;necessary for the formation of a symbol.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;You should at least note that this was the summary only </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
You're right, it was a dirty trick, as was my asking the question in the  <br>
first place. If I had no idea what a definition was, how on earth could I  <br>
know if your definition of "definition" was correct?<br>
<p>
Let me also say that although you have certainly not made a non-circular  <br>
definition of "definition", you have made a hell of a lot better stab at it  <br>
than most people.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;and that I also included an explanation of all the cognitive objects         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;associated with "explanation", "information", "formation", and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"symbol".  </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
You did fine for "information", "formation", and "symbol" but you didn't  <br>
give an explanation of "explanation", and that's all a definition is.  <br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This explanation was in turn the information necessary for the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;formation of the symbol "definition"</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
This what? I'm not familiar with the second word you used in your sentence <br>
above. Could you give me an explanation?<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I could also point to the subjective aspect of watching something         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;being defined, and that would also be sufficient for defining the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;symbol "definition".  </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
You are of course correct, that's how we understand most things, but that's  <br>
not a definition. All of us already have a pretty good idea what a definition  <br>
is, even if we can't define it, that's why the question " What is the    <br>
definition of definition" does not sound like gibberish to us and that's <br>
why a dictionary is not a useless circular book.<br>
<p>
We don't have definitions for the most important things in life. I've never <br>
seen a definition of mind or intelligence or consciousness that I thought <br>
was any good, and I don't expect to ever see one, at least not one that could <br>
be written on a piece of paper smaller than the Galaxy. That doesn't mean <br>
however that the terms are meaningless. Good definitions are always nice to <br>
have, but in most cases are vastly overrated. People are seldom able to  <br>
produce good definitions, even of familiar concepts, and it's even rarer that <br>
they need them, unless they're dealing in a few highly specialized fields <br>
like mathematics. Formal logic is only a small part of our intelligence, <br>
so most of our knowledge is not in the form of definitions, it's in the <br>
form "like this" and "not like this". That's just what you'd expect if we <br>
are more like neural nets than expert systems, few definitions but lots of <br>
examples.     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In other words, pointing to the subjective aspect would indeed         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;define the symbol of "definition" and give it a referent, but not         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the *explanatory* (rather than experiential) referent you were         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;looking for.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Definitions are explanatory not experiential, that's way they're so hard to <br>
find, however I know what you're driving at and I basically agree.<br>
