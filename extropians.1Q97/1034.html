Q:  Miss Alabama, how do you think you'll earn your living?<br>
<p>
A:  I would not earn money, because we should not earn money, because if<br>
we were supposed to earn money, then we would be rich, but I'm broke,<br>
which is why I would not earn money.<br>
<p>
Q:  I see.  Wanna go out for a bite to eat?<br>
<p>
A:  I would not eat, because we should not eat, because if we were<br>
supposed to eat, then we would be fed, but I am hungry, which is why I<br>
would not eat.<br>
<p>
Q:  Oh, well never mind.  &lt;thinks&gt;  Will you breathe in the near future?<br>
<p>
A:  &lt;turns bright red, then purple, finally passing out&gt;<br>
<p>
Q:  Hah.  Gets 'em every time.  :)<br>
