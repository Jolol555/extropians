The same is true of looking at a sample of something through a<br>
microscope. Exactly what is revealed to the scientist peeking at the<br>
sample "is just as much, if not more, dependent on the observer." What<br>
makes the scientist better capable of making useful observations is his<br>
education.<br>
<p>
That is why we have professionally trained psychologists and<br>
psychiatrists, people who have rigorously developed specialized skills<br>
in analyzing subtle symptoms. Via their education, these people tend to<br>
be, by degree, less likely to respond subjectively, and more likely to<br>
respond objectively. From large sums of learned data, these<br>
professionals can make beneficial associations between symptoms and<br>
neurosis. These professionals have developed a greater sensitivity to<br>
ascertaing the condition of another entity.  <br>
<p>
How we percieve art necessarily entails how we interpret it. Normally we<br>
percieve art subjectively, indulging in it, and thus we interpret it in<br>
a wholly different fashion than a person seeking to analyse that work<br>
objectively, simply recording the symptoms that they have learned to<br>
identify in order that those symptoms may be assessed in retrospect of<br>
past tests and experiments showing certain corrollations between certain<br>
symptoms and certain neurosis. <br>
<p>
Thus I believe the interpretation of what is revealed is potentially<br>
much less subjective, and much more scientific than your response may be<br>
implying.<br>
<p>
Simply put, some people are more qualified than others. <br>
<p>
I believe a number of artists find comfort in the idea of art's elusive<br>
subjectivity while they promote art's continued mystification. Artists<br>
of this type are often unable and/or unwilling to express their feelings<br>
directly to another, and thus, necessitated to express themselves in<br>
some fashion, they choose art believing that their true identity will be<br>
somehow veiled through their art. In this sense art is sacred to them.<br>
But the science of objectivity has a thing with spoiling sacred ground,<br>
and science can better learn to objectively interpret what the artist is<br>
expressing, unbeknowst to the artist, and in many cases, more<br>
affectively than the artist him or herself. For the artist, though<br>
having a skill in creating expressive work, may have little education or<br>
concern in interpreting all the depths of what that art may corrollate<br>
to. <br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
