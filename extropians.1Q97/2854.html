<p>
We need good neural interfaces, of course. The computational problem <br>
seems to be solvable in principle, but we need plenty of computing power. <br>
I would say this is a nanotech-level problem.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, I wonder what the order of magnitude is that we're talking about here.</i><br>

<i>&gt; possible, then the connections across the spinal column would then be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; biggest challenge.  How many nerves are we talking about at that juncture?</i><br>
<p>
The relevant number is the number of axons in the nerves. We have 12 pairs<br>
of brain nerves and the spinal cord to think about. I seem to recall on<br>
the order of 1 million axons in the optic nerves, and as a guess around<br>
the same in the spinal cord (these are just order-of-magnitude estimates). <br>
The other brain nerves are almost all much smaller, let's say they have 1<br>
million axons together. The we get around 3 million axons to deal with. <br>
