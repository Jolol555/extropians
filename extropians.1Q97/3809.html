<i>&gt; &gt; Yes, stealing work without permission is a crime; fraudulently claiming</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; authorship or invetion is a crime; but copyrights and patents aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; aimed at those actions: they are aimed specifically at preventing, by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; force, the use of information legally obtained.  If I invent something,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I will keep the idea under wraps with non-disclosure agreements while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it is being developed, and you bet I'd prosecute anyone who broke his</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contract or stole from my safe.  But if I freely choose to sell the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thing on the open market where anyone can see how it works, I have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; right to have the government use its guns to prevent those folks from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; going into business against me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ok, by that same logic.  If I were to write a book and publish it on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; open market.  Why shouldn't folks be able to copy it and sell it as</i><br>
<i>&gt; there own with the resulting royalties? After all, its on the open</i><br>
<i>&gt; market.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, exactly.  The fact that it is so counter-intuitive to you is<br>
because we were brought up in a world that just assumed that copyrights<br>
were used to protect authors like that.  In a free market, non-coercive<br>
means should be used instead.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm as big a fan of the freedom to contract as anyone. Here's a hypo for</i><br>
<i>&gt; you.  If I were to create, say a new type of hard disk that stored 1000X</i><br>
<i>&gt; the information of the current industry standard.  How would i be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to prevent every other manufacturer from benefiting from my R&amp;D in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; absence of a patent?</i><br>
<p>
(1) Only sell them as black boxes to those who sign a contract never<br>
to open them or let anyone else open them for reverse-engineering. (They<br>
might also have an interest in keeping the technology from /their/<br>
competitors, and so are likely to pay for the security involved).  (2)<br>
Make a bundle by being first to market with huge numbers so that the<br>
market is saturated before your competitors catch up. (3) Do (2), then<br>
capitalize on your good name and reputation for innovation to get<br>
contracts for future products. (4) Demonstrate the product to every<br>
company with the means of competing with you in such a way that you<br>
don't disclose any vital information about its internals, then let them<br>
license it from you. (5) Never sell it at all, but buy up companies<br>
whose major cost is data storage, and use your technology privately to<br>
undercut their competitors (I like that one).<br>
<p>
I'm sure I could think of a few more devious (but non-coercive) means...<br>
