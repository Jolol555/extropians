<p>
The two extremes are not very parallel to one another, because we<br>
have tons of Platos's writings and none of Democritus's writings,<br>
so it is difficult to compare the two. But Aristotle is something<br>
like a reformed and corrected Plato compared to Democritus, a Plato<br>
with the raging excesses of abstraction cut back. Based on the<br>
little we know of Democritus, he was a good deal more radical than<br>
either Plato or Aristotle. But they say that Democritus was the<br>
first to claim that the Milky Way is composed of stars too dim to<br>
resolve with the naked eye, so he was probably a pretty good<br>
observer, and Aristotle did stress observation more than Plato did.<br>
<p>
It's really mostly a matter of accident that Aristotle is so famous<br>
at all. He was reputed to be a good writer, but we will never know,<br>
because *everything* he published has been lost. The horribly dry<br>
"books" that we have from Aristotle are all just lecture notes...<br>
they survived because they spent several centuries in someone's<br>
basement, instead of getting torched with all the rest of the great<br>
classical libraries. After the Crusaders sacked Constantinople<br>
(centuries before the Turks came and took over the charred remnants),<br>
what was left of Greek literature was essentially a small random<br>
sample.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if the best stuff got lost,<br>
and I wouldn't be at all surprised if Democritus turned out to be<br>
among the best stuff. But now all we can do is ponder the fragments<br>
(quotations in books written by lesser minds, who quoted Democritus<br>
only to refute him by citing conventional wisdom) and wonder.<br>
<p>
Actually, I shouldn't be too hard on old Ari. There are some parts<br>
of the Nicomachean Ethics that I like a great deal.<br>
