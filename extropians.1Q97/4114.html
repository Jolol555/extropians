        I believe that one of Rand's key intentions with her terminology and<br>
application of meanings to words was to focus on *why* we classify such<br>
words as 'undesirable'.  If you take a look at the word "selfish" without<br>
any of the culturally provided baggage, it basically means: 'one who is<br>
absorbed in his or her own interests'.  I see nothing wrong with that as it<br>
is, nor did Rand.<br>
What is unfortunate is how discredited the word has become due to all the<br>
baggage that has been associated with it through the decades.  Now the word<br>
"selfish" has been perverted to meaning "miserly", "conceited" and "uncaring".<br>
"Selfish" is just one of the words that Rand took the liberty of<br>
re-evaluating.  There are thousands of fnords in the English language, and<br>
it is a lot easier to create them than eliminate them. <br>

<i>&gt;An analogous phenomenon exists with many Extropians.   We have a philosophy </i><br>

        You forget that this is merely a list that deals with the arguments<br>
and information provided by like-minded people...a list exclusively made for<br>
such discourse.  Most (if not all) on this list do more for extropy than<br>
check their mail every hour and subscribe to a few magazines.  Extropy's<br>
something that I cannot even comprehend being idle and wishy-washy about.  I<br>
would wager that most people on this list were extropians before they even<br>
heard the term spoken.<br>

<i>&gt;+ Don't rant on about the virtues of selfishness, you are contradcting</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself.  If you think selfishness is so great, then you should just be </i><br>
<i>&gt;selfish and not let anybody else in on it.</i><br>
<p>
        As I said, it depends on how you want to look at the meaning of<br>
selfishness.  If you are totally unselfish (looking at the uncorrupted<br>
meaning of the word) you are an altruist.  How can *you* have a cause if<br>
*you* are not selfish?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;+ we need to be much more _short_ sighted, greedy and local when it</i><br>
<i>&gt;comes to most of our lives.</i><br>
<p>
        I simply disagree, though I hope you intended a different meaning<br>
than I received.  Extropy is generally a balance between short and long<br>
sight, as well as a balance between optimism and realism.  When you are<br>
enacting the present, always consider the ramifications it can have on the<br>
future.<br>
