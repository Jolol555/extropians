Last Wednesday, March 26, from 1:00 - 3:00 on national television's The<br>
Family Channel's hit program  "Home and Family" produced a segment on<br>
"Fountain of Youth" with a focus on neurosuspensions.<br>
<p>
Did anyone see it?  <br>
<p>
I was the featured guest, along with David Caradine, the 1992 women's<br>
olympic champion (swimming), Marilyn Keegan (radio personality and<br>
psychologist).<br>
<p>
The show's host, Cristina Ferrara (well known Ford Agency model) was<br>
remarkably sweet and interested in cryonics.  She gave me the opportunity to<br>
discuss a neurosuspension, why one would choose neuro over whole body, a bit<br>
about the cryonics procedure, and why it is a viable measure in preserving<br>
life.  I hadn't met Cristina before, so I didn't have a clue that she is a<br>
very religious person, and openly believes Jesus her savior.  Even in light<br>
of this, as I found out mid-way during the "live" show, she maintained a<br>
sense of humor and sincere interest.  She also did not embarrass me nor<br>
attempt to ridicule cryonics nor neurosuspensions (she even gave me a<br>
complementary quote for my Web site which I will put up at some point.)<br>
<p>
The show ended with twenty people on "stage" asking all sorts of serious,<br>
informed as well as fun-provoking questions.  We laughed - kidded.  One man<br>
who was self-professed "out of shape" teased me about the possibility of my<br>
having to use his body as a resort if bio-tech bodies are not available at<br>
my reanimation.  I told him I have an insurance policy against that option<br>
-;)  He said he wanted Cristina's body (its' made a ton of money), and she<br>
said she wanted one that had less bulk on it and searched around the room<br>
for one that she would reserve.  Off the air, she asked me what Jesus would<br>
do if he came to get her body and couldn't find her head!  (In that if she<br>
was a neurosuspendee, her head would be in a dewar).  We had a good laugh.<br>
<p>
Although the fun was during the last few minutes of the show, I did have a<br>
fair amount of time to answer pertinent questions and to reach a lot of<br>
America about extending life indefinitely and neurosuspension.  <br>
