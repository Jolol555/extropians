From: Eugene Leitl &lt;Eugene.Leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Stuart A. Kauffman, "The Origins of Order", Oxford University Press</i><br>
<i>&gt; (1993), p 34, 461.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Among the most obvious features of cell differentiation is that less</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex organisms possess fewer cell types than more complex organisms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, yeast has three cell types, the coelenterate hydra has 15 to</i><br>
<i>&gt; 17, annelid worms have about 60, and humans about 250. A plot of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of cell types in an organism as a function of the estimated number</i><br>
<i>&gt; of genes in that organism shows a profound and simple relation: The</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of cell types increases as about a square-root function of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of the genes [...].</i><br>
<p>
That's a very interesting result.  Later quotes suggest though that it<br>
could be up to a linear function of the genes, which would be less<br>
surprising.  A priori there is nothing too astonishing if the number of<br>
genes is proportional to the number of cell types.<br>
<p>
I've been reading some Stephen Jay Gould since our discussion here<br>
about his theories.  I lost the original reference, so I have chosen<br>
to start with "Wonderful Life", a book about early Cambrian organisms.<br>
The main theme of the book is that these early animals were in some ways<br>
more diverse than in the present day, with many body plans which don't<br>
exist any more.  I'm not sure though how that fits in with what was said<br>
here about complexity expanding like a random walk.<br>
<p>
I'm about halfway through the book and I've learned a whole lot more<br>
invertebrate anatomy than I ever wanted to.  It seems that Gould's<br>
measure of diversity mostly relates to how the antennas and legs attach<br>
to the various body segments in these creatures.  It turns out that among<br>
invertebrates today (the vast majority of animals), only a few specific<br>
patterns are observed.  Back in the early Cambrian era (shortly after the<br>
appearance of multicellular life) there were many more arrangements of<br>
limbs.  So in a sense we have lost diversity, although the specific<br>
patterns which have been retained have still branched into a wide range of<br>
animal forms.<br>
<p>
The main lesson I have taken from the book so far is that, despite what<br>
Gould implies, defining and measuring complexity and diversity is a<br>
difficult problem.  I don't find his measures particularly convincing,<br>
especially given the experimental difficulty even in figuring out what<br>
these animals originally looked like.<br>
<p>
The big puzzle is why it is that evolution has not been able to<br>
depart from the established body patterns once they were established.<br>
Earlier animals were able to evolve into wildly different shapes.  Later,<br>
they seem to have lost that ability.<br>
<p>
Is there any significance to the fact that the survivors are ones which<br>
have fixed forms?  Gould seems to think that it was random which body<br>
shapes survived.  Does he assume that all of these Cambrian animals<br>
would have led to descendants who were equally fixed in shape?  Or is<br>
it possible that somehow shape constancy was correlated with survival,<br>
and that creatures which retained complete structural mutability (over<br>
millions of years) somehow were selected against?<br>
<p>
Maybe the last part of the book will say.  It looks though more like a<br>
polemic against the attitudes of 19th century paleontologists.  Gould<br>
really comes off as arrogant when he gets into this philosophical stuff.<br>
Is it true that he's a dyed-in-the-wool Marxist?  I thought I read that<br>
somewhere.<br>
