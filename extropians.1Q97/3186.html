<p>
I've been thinking about this problem also.  If the government is wrong about<br>
HIV=AIDS, and the news 'gets out', it may convince many people that the<br>
whole concept of public health [which is based on the notion that a healthy<br>
lifestyle is not just a matter of personal responsibility, but also a government<br>
management imperative to be achieved with the tools of mass immunizations,<br>
control of food and water supplies, aggressive family planning programs, <br>
expensive "wars" against cancer and AIDS, and regulating or restricting<br>
access to alternative health therapies or dietary supplements] is flawed.<br>
<p>
To some degree, the governments stand vis a vis medical marijuana<br>
initiatives points up their resistance to the idea of giving up the 'nanny state'<br>
idea.  As Inventing the AIDS Virus (pg 390) points out:<br>
<p>
"On April 28th, less than a month after Duesberg's first paper on<br>
the HIV question appeared in Cancer Research, the secretary of Health<br>
and Human Services sent out a memo titled "MEDIA ALERT". <br>
Describing the situation created by Duesberg's paper, the staff member <br>
ominously noted that "the article apparently went through the normal<br>
pre-publication process and should have been flagged at NIH." The<br>
staffer than pointed out the threat to the government:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This obviously has the potential to raise a lot of controversy</i><br>
<i>&gt;(if this isn't the virus, how do we know the blood supply is safe?</i><br>
<i>&gt;How do we know anything about transmission? How could you all</i><br>
<i>&gt;be so stupid, and why should we ever believe you again?).."</i><br>
<p>
Together with the sudden cancellations of Duesbergs appearances on<br>
network news at the 11th hour, I conclude that the state has and will<br>
marshaled considerable resources to keep that very story that you<br>
predict from appearing.  You may be aware of the actions of John<br>
Maddox, the editor of a publication you cite, Nature, to censor<br>
Duesberg and others [J Maddox, "Has Duesberg a Right of Reply?"<br>
Nature, 363 (1993): 109] However, I think that because the theory<br>
that HIV=AIDS violates SO many established principles of virology<br>
this challenge to the accepted dogma may and has bypassed the lack <br>
of major media attention through the internet and alternative press<br>
back door [Many thinking people that I know don't watch the<br>
nightly news anymore for anything other than a hoot]. <br>
<p>
So maybe by 2000 or 2001 the media you cite will get around<br>
to acknowledging that many scientists question the governments<br>
version of how AIDS is caused.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps another indirect measure of public perception would be<br>
the price of the stocks of Boroughs Welcome (sp?) and other<br>
pervayors of toxic therapy on the financial futures exchanges.<br>
<p>
I hope your prediction is born out.<br>
<p>

PS: How do I get to this Foresight Exchange online prediction game?<br>
       I found several pages related to Foresight Exchange, but nothing<br>
       about predictions.  Thanks.<br>
