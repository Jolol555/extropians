You know, going by Hofstadter and others (Edelman?), most of our thought<br>
might be evolutionary in nature.  In fact the whole basis of our success<br>
could be that we are evolution uploaded -- we have ideas at random and<br>
select them, instead of children.  (Those too so far, but we haven't<br>
been evolving by them much, probably.)  Which makes sense -- the only<br>
known simple methods of space searching are Darwinism and brute force<br>
exhaustion.<br>
