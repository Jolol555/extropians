Bipedalism:<br>
-------------<br>
<p>
I recall an article from probably the National Geographic or perhaps the<br>
Scientific American in the early eighties concerning a formula that<br>
predicted a 175% chance of intelligent life per galaxy. The man's name I<br>
can only recall as a Da...??*. This formula had about 12 factors and<br>
possibly factor 6 was bipedalism. I recall bipedalism was suggested as<br>
being due to sexual attraction caused by the face-to-face sex position, the<br>
purpose of which was selection, longevity and the need for future planning.<br>
<p>
<p>
Does anyone recall the man's name?<br>
<p>
Baldness:<br>
-----------<br>
<p>
In 1991, I saw the movie "The Lawnmowerman" and a TV program about a<br>
gorilla named Coco (?) who had been taught sufficient language for it to be<br>
suggested that her consent was required for a surgical procedure. These<br>
shows prompted me to wondered about baldness and about the following<br>
admittedly far-fetched evolutionary intervention scenario:-<br>
<p>
1) Take a new-born, intelligent and domesticated hairy animal with an<br>
enormous sense, say smell, and disable 90% of these sensory pathways. <br>
2) Assume that its brain's plasticity might reuse that spare 90%, plus<br>
other hirsuitly deprived brain areas, if given intense language training.<br>
  a) Incubate the new born in a hairy cybersuit fitted with natural plus VR<br>
ports and let it suckle a pseudo-mother in quasi-virtual reality where the<br>
'parents' are mostly cyber puppets. <br>
  b) These "ego-self-identified-pseudo-parents" attempt to teach the new<br>
born a 'language' and upon puberty large numbers of such animals are<br>
virtually and actually mated to produce offspring which are handled in like<br>
fashion.<br>
3) Assume the cyber-parenting takes hold with each new generation gaining<br>
more 'word' power from more natural and less puppet parenting with each<br>
generation never leaving the quasi-virtual reality. <br>
4) Assume the parasitic language meme successfully competes for brain space<br>
or that the natural parents remember to perform the 'circumcision' of the<br>
<p>
