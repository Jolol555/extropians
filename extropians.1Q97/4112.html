Is memory of the event enough to cause guilt?<br>
It is an implanted memory programmed into it during creation.<br>

Is capability of murder enough for guilt?<br>

How humane.<br>

What do you think media memetic propagation( selective education) is?<br>
What do you think psychological therapy is?<br>
Though the average therapist does not know how <br>

They know word games for manipulating values and goals <br>
which rely on individuals willpower;<br>
you know how many therapists it takes to change a lightbulb, <br>
one, but the lightbulb has to want to change.<br>
