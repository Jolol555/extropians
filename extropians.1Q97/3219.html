What percentage of companies commit fraud today on a daily basis?<br>
Your implicit assertion is not only controversial and unsupported,<br>
it's also vague. Even if it were "true" (and it's so vague that it<br>
is, as Pauli might have said, not even wrong), how much of that<br>
current fraud is a result of big business taking advantage of <br>
corruption and special advantages given them by the state? Eliminate<br>
the state, and perhaps you'd eliminate most of that fraud. This<br>
itself is vague, but it's all I can come up with to counter your<br>
"argument". Vagueness gets vagueness, and specifics get specifics.<br>
