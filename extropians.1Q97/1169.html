<i> &gt; &lt;&lt; Evolution is over.  I'm in charge now.  My genes have made the fatal</i><br>
<i> &gt;  mistake of building a survival machine that is more powerful than them,</i><br>
<i> &gt;  and giving it free will.  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
  <br>
<i> &gt; How has free will been proven to overcome evolution already? When did this</i><br>
<i> &gt; happen?  Isnt this a bit of a "controversial " statement?</i><br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;How can it be otherwise?  You are free to choose not to breed,<br>
 aren't you?  <br>
<p>
That is not free will , that is birthcontrol, I am "free to choose "  to<br>
abstain, also, but evolution (instincts) will ensure that i feel deprived,<br>
repressed.<br>
 It was the INVENTION of birth control that changed things for me, and the<br>
gradual EVOLUTION of society into where I could have (some)  value in society<br>
without being  a mother or wife.<br>
Until then,freewill exercised in those directions was hardly a fun endeavor,<br>
and could have in some times, branded me a heretic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;That alone changes things.  </i><br>
<p>
Since it is technology (birth control) which I attribute to the change,<br>
freewill<br>
does play apart, but on a level of, like, a third abstraction. <br>
We have freewill, so we desire sex without consequences, so someone invents a<br>
way around it, and then society evolves to meet that challenge....<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; My particular expression<br>
 of the idea is perhaps a bit rhetorical, but the fact it represents<br>
 is inevitable. &gt;&gt;.<br>
<p>
I thought maybe it was an overstatement, or a projection...<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; The processes that lead to our creation will<br>
 continue, but the fundamental replicator unit is no longer a piece<br>
 of DNA, because I've discovered it, and I can choose not to carry<br>
 it into the next generation if I want.<br>
 <br>
That is not being in CHARGE of you DNA, that is HALTING it.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I would love to think that i can, by free will alone,  make myself live</i><br>
<i> &gt; indefinetely...</i><br>
<i> &gt; hmm...</i><br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt;Certainly not.  Reality is still a constraint.  But you can use free<br>
 will to overcome your natural urges to breed, or to encourage others<br>
 to do the same.  Therefore, the mental processes that lead to our<br>
 choices to propogate (I use that term instead of "breed" because the<br>
 latter implies biological propogation only) are the replicators from<br>
 now on, not our DNA.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Mental processes, including freewill , are still caused by deterministic<br>
brain processes. Unless you are hinting at some mystical unkown force,<br>
outside physical laws.<br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;The process of natural evolution is simply a mathematical consequence<br>
 of duplication, mutation, and competition.  It is inevitable, and will<br>
 continue.  What changes, though, are the entities upon which it works.<br>
 For this period of Earth's history, it has been little chunks of DNA.<br>
 From now on, since we have free will, it will be little chunks of<br>
 motivation.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
[ I like that metaphor, DL]<br>
<p>
<p>
  &lt;&lt;Of course, DNA will continue in other non-free species,<br>
 and other replicators may be discovered as well.  But for /us/, we<br>
 no longer slavishly serve DNA.&gt;&gt;<br>
 <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
I see your point.<br>
i apologize for mistaking you for passive optimism.<br>
To -that- extent one is "in charge" now.<br>
<p>
(Unless you are being controlled by your subconscious even right now, and are<br>
saying all this because you are  emotionally  repressed ; )<br>
<p>
When one says one's in charge now, one means we can, TODAY, chose what<br>
aspects of your present evoulutionary state we will  (or will not) adhere to,<br>
we can't avoid this, since we were made by evolving. And changing the<br>
physical constraints ( like longevity, intelligence, physical limitations )<br>
is apainfully slow process, even with free will.... even with technology...<br>
<p>
 Still the constraints have to be challenged, and breakthroughs, like the<br>
Singularity, ie:  changing "physical" or "hardwired" part of our evolution<br>
(chemicals,  brain implants, genetics, whatever) must be set in motion if we<br>
are to really overcome evolution and genetics.<br>
