In response to Mitchell Porter:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I asked myself how much *subjective* time would elapse between </i><br>
<i>&gt; human-equivalence and maximum speed. If there was no ceiling to</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed, then elapsed time would be infinite, but in practice it's going </i><br>
<i>&gt; to reach some apex (e.g. a millionfold increase).</i><br>
<p>
1)  I don't think there's an upper limit that They can't work around.<br>
2)  I've never seen a "limit" little 'ol *me* couldn't work around.<br>
3)  Using mathematics to model a Singularity is ridiculous... fun,<br>
    but still ridiculous.  Figure that your calculations are a lower<br>
    limit on how much computation will be done after time X.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have no idea what the rate of increase in processor power</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be once you start making *real* quantum computers, as opposed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to simulating them.</i><br>
<p>
Really, really large.  I've always thought that from even a 32-qubit<br>
processor to nanotechnology (via protein-fold simulation) would be a<br>
fairly small step.  I think you'd probably have to figure that the<br>
number of qubits would double every two years, so we now have an<br>
insanely superexponential version of Moore's Law and the main bottleneck<br>
is quantum memory for output and even interim computation.  If two<br>
million branches of reality try to write to the same byte, the result is<br>
an "ugly mess", as the saying goes.<br>
