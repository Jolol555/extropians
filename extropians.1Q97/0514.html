Magma!  Mantles of Earth-mass or greater terrestrial planets.  How<br>

they're expansionist... ores are ores are grounds for wars.<br>

And I suspect there would be a convergence of transhuman and transalien<br>
forms... not to any specific form, but to generalists and polymorphs,<br>
which will increase interaction.  Hopefully based on trades rather than<br>
raids.<br>

No.  Ever read Gould's _Wonderful Life_ or anything else on the Burgess<br>
Shale?  The existing phyla are a subset of what animals started out<br>
with, and it's not particularly obvious that the survivors had anything<br>
more going for them than luck.  Our own phyla, the Chordata, came from<br>
one proto-thingy with no fossile relatives from that time.  Of current<br>
forms, Chordata is the one with greatest absolute and relative<br>
brainpower (but what _is_ the intelligence of an anthill?  I'm not<br>
claiming they're sentient or anything, but has anyone really tried<br>
comparing them with vertebrates?) but we obviously have no idea what any<br>
of the extinct forms could have accomplished -- or what extant<br>
non-chordates could have done had vertebrates not been occupying those<br>
niches.<br>

I'm not sure what that sentence means.  Arguably apes and cetaceans are<br>
physically much better adapted for their environments, limiting their<br>
immediate need for intelligence, which may be what you were driving at.<br>
