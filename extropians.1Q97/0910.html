Luna might need to threaten to attack Earth.  Consider Alaska or Hawaii<br>

Luna needn't qualify as a relatively helpless nation, as I said.<br>

You're overlooking the fact that these convicts have been shipped off of<br>
Earth in the first place.  Permanent exile, given low-g bone and<br>
muscular decay.  If you can get away with that, nuking them after they<br>
turn threatening won't necessarily be a big PR problem.<br>

Impossible?  You're the one who seems to have been arguing that it is<br>
impossible for Earth to control a lunar colony.  I'm in the "it will<br>

 They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters."<br>
