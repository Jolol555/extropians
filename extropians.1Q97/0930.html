To counter my claim that rationality will ultimately triumph, Damien R. <br>
Sullivan hypothesized that a leader could be rational but have followers who <br>
dogmatically follow her.  Thus, they would be following rational orders that <br>
will work while not having good rational skills themsleves, in fact, the <br>
leader would work to prevent them from developing those skills.  And, they're <br>
stamping out rationality everywhere in the world, preventing people, such as <br>
myself from spreading it.<br>
<p>
My first thought is, how does the proposed leader keep all contrary memes from <br>
infiltrating her masses?  I know, I know, they're all dogmatic, so their minds <br>
are closed to outside ideas.  Pure fantasy!  Dogmatism may be tight, but it's <br>
not that tight.  There's always lots of leaks in it.  Especially if the masses <br>
grow up in the modern world, interacting with people of all different <br>
backgrounds and ideologies, watching television and movies, reading magazines <br>
and newspapers, surfing the Net.  Dogmatism is extremely difficult to maintain <br>
in this type of high-intensity media environment.  <br>
<p>
This type of high-intensity media environment is a fairly recent development <br>
among humans; it hasn't really kicked in until within the past thirty years or <br>
so, when people started growing up watching TV and seeing movies.  There's <br>
just too many ideas floating around everywhere; how's a leader supposed to <br>
keep everyone in line?  And as the Internet becomes more pervasive and <br>
bandwidth increases, the meme exchange will be higher than it's ever been <br>
before.  People will be surrounded with ideas contrary to their own.  This <br>
will make creating a powerfully dogmatic belief system extremely difficult.  <br>
The competition for minds and allegience will be fierce.  <br>
<p>
The war of ideas will continue, but faster and more intensely now.  The belief <br>
systems that emerge will be increasingly powerful and addictive, constantly <br>
mutating and becoming even more robust.  I can imagine people from various <br>
belief systems infiltrating other ones and finding ways to subvert them; <br>
gaining an understanding of the psychologies of the adherents and developing <br>
ways to slowly attract them to different ideas, developing products and <br>
presentations that would appeal to them but have subtly subversive messages <br>
woven in seamlessly.<br>
<p>
This all should be quite exciting and iteresting to watch and to participate <br>
in.  I'm already developing some of the belief systems I'm wanting to spread.  <br>
A lot of what I'm doing is studying  very powerful belief systems, finding <br>
lots of common elements and working on building bridges between belief <br>
systems.  I'm trying to develop smooth paths between various belief systems, <br>
so people's minds can move more easily between them.  My intent is to keep <br>
belief systems from becoming too dissociated from each other.  A world at war <br>
is dangerous for all in it, including myself.  I intend to be a peacemaker, a <br>
sort of psychological diplomat, showing people that they are not as opposed as <br>
they think they are.  But I'll discuss *that* in another post...<br>
<p>
So, will Reason triumph in this intense exchange of ideas?  My gut feeling is <br>
that it will because it is ultimately superior.  But then, what the hell do I <br>
know?  We'll just have to let it play out and see.  I'll do my best to promote <br>
rationality and intelligent behavior and encourage as many others as I can to <br>
do similarly.  In any case, there's a lot of work to do.<br>
