What follows may sound a little crazy, but the news about successful adult<br>
mammal cloning and the reaction that's already apparent has set my brain to<br>
boiling.<br>
<p>
As I'm sure most of you have already realized, this technology suggests a<br>
"quick and dirty" approach to transcending the "natural" human lifespan.<br>
 Assuming that the technology for repairing broken neural pathways continues<br>
to develop as quickly as it has seemed to in the last couple of years, it<br>
appears that cloning up a replacement body and transplanting the brain is a<br>
pathway that is almost within reach.  This assumes that the donor body can be<br>
developed in such a way that its brain does not develop a consciousness or<br>
personality.  This last point presents some technical challenges, to be sure,<br>
but nothing that can't be overcome with near-term technology.  For discussion<br>
purposes, let us call this the "trade-in" strategy.<br>
<p>
As I mentioned in my shoot-from-the-hip first reaction posted to the list, I<br>
sense that we'll see a massive reaction against this technology.  It's<br>
entirely possible that the media will quickly transform this into a political<br>
hot potato and that the politically "safest" way to deal with it will be to<br>
ban it.<br>
<p>
Fortunately, it sounds like the basic technology isn't that complicated.  It<br>
isn't hard for me to imagine a facility being developed outside the US in<br>
which "trade-ins" could be cloned and developed.  All that's needed is a<br>
basic genetics lab, a source of host mothers and then whatever it takes to<br>
maintain the trade-ins.  The actual transplant technology won't be needed for<br>
at least 15-20 years, obviously.<br>
<p>
Of course, folks who will want to take advantage of the trade-in strategy<br>
should optimally get their first clone going at around age 40, so that a<br>
fresh 20-year-old body is waiting for them when they get to be 60.  (The way<br>
I feel some mornings now, I'm thinking starting one at 20 might not be a bad<br>
idea :-)<br>
<p>
The point is this: This idea will certainly occur to a lot of people, and<br>
very soon.  Creating relatively secure and, probably more important, secluded<br>
facilities for this endeavor ought to be a high priority for people who can<br>
afford it.  Certain areas of southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America would<br>
seem well-suited to siting such facilities.<br>
<p>
Assuming interest in such an idea, how might these facilities be developed?<br>
 Obviously, a network of the right people would need to be developed to bring<br>
together money and expertise.  Biologists and physicians willing to work on<br>
the idea would have to be brought together with investors willing to put a<br>
great deal of capital into developing the facilities, which would then have<br>
to be built and managed.  The Alcor organization of course seems a prime<br>
candidate to serve as an initial node for developing such a network.  I<br>
wonder if anyone is interested in this idea?<br>
<p>
(And yes, BTW, I just happen to be reading "The Lost World," Michael<br>
Crichton's sequel to "Jurassic Park" right now . . .)<br>
