Right, as far as it goes. And they're not bad as heuristics.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the four attempts I mentioned all let the fish <br>
slip out of the net while still doing something useful. They are <br>
also, to my view, rather reductionistic. Is this coincidence?<br>
<p>
Or is "boring" nothing more than a statement about "human <br>
nature"--borrowing from an old tale I sometimes tell about <br>
Bhairavananda:<br>
<p>
(po) (animal) if it doesn't elicit terror (might eat me!) or joy <br>
(it might taste/feel really good!), it's boring. <br>
<p>
Tastes can become more reified, if not more refined, until humans <br>
can even find football games interesting. Or so I'm told by others who <br>
seem human. :)<br>
