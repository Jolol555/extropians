Yes, so if a system is consistent, that is, if you can't prove that the same <br>
thing is both true and false with it, then it is not complete, and that means <br>
that there are TRUE statements that do NOT have a proof in that system. <br>
That's why I don't understand when you say " Godel does not really have any <br>
implications about the limits of human knowledge". <br>
                         <br>

Yes.<br>
                <br>

No. The Goldbach conjecture is either true or it is not, someday a computer  <br>
will find an even number that is not the sum of two prime numbers OR it will <br>
not, there is no middle ground. Neither Godel or Turing said otherwise.  <br>
The question is, will we ever know if it is true or not? Godel said that, if <br>
not Goldbach then, there are other similar statements that are true but we can<br>
never prove. Turing proved that we can't even identify these hopeless cases,  <br>
so we can never tell if the best thing to do is to just give up or whether we <br>
should continue to beat our head against a wall.<br>
                                 <br>
Put it this way, if you want the concept of "number" to be meaningful in your <br>
system and you want the ability to count things, then it will include The <br>
Peano Postulates. Is the Goldbach Conjecture consistent with The Peano <br>
Postulates? I don't know, nobody does, and possibly nobody ever will.<br>
