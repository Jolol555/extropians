        In addition, this list is a constant flux.  An unknown amount of<br>
people subscribe and unsubscribe per month.  Hopefully those who have left<br>
have gotten something out of our posts and, as Tom said, leave the wiser.<br>
I think that we, as extropians, should have open minds to the ideals and<br>
pursuits of others.  We all have different personalities and interests, but<br>
the same united goal of unlimited progress and maximized potential.  Often<br>
on the list, some will be enraged by certain posts or posters and in the<br>
same effect, some will be enlightened.  Just as the signal to noise ratio<br>
fluxuates frequently.  Those who are leaving the list are doing just that:<br>
leaving the list...they are not forfeiting their extropianism.  Don't worry<br>
about it [referring to Chris Hind's post here]; cells replenish themselves,<br>
as do we.<br>
