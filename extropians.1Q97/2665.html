<i>&gt; I have 4 questions for you:</i><br>
<p>
Most people imagine the following as self-evident: "I exist". We imagine<br>
it will be true until we die. But to me its not a true or false<br>
statement but one of degree. To say I we must refer to the ego, that<br>
which is sayin "I", but my ego comes and goes. When fully focused on an<br>
activity, I do not exist to the degree as when I am focused on me. When<br>
sleeping yet not dreaming, I exist to very very little degree, my ego is<br>
not existing at all. There is no one to say, "I exist". My ego, that<br>
which says "I", is created on the fly. It comes and goes, and eventually<br>
[if I do not attain immortality] it will go forever. <br>
<p>
The statement, "I think therefor I am", is more useful than the<br>
statement, "I am". Where "I am" or "I exist" are absolute statements, "I<br>
think therefor I am" is conditional. It functions as saying "If I think,<br>
then I am".<br>
<p>
When we have developed over time so that we can deal with more variables<br>
in any given moment, I believe we will begin to make a shift from<br>
absolute statements to more conditional statements. I believe our<br>
language and thus our perception will in turn reflect this. As we<br>
develop we will have the capacity to deal with a greater level of<br>
relativity. Einstein came up with a theory of relativity. This theory is<br>
still very difficult, even in simplistic terms, for the general populace<br>
to understand. This is due to our current perception of the world,<br>
structured by our language, our language being saturated in concepts of<br>
absolutes, because we do not have the current capacity of consciousness<br>
to deal with enough variables at any one time. Not only are we limited<br>
to the number of variables that we can deal with in any given moment,<br>
but we are limited to the number of perspectives we can entertain in any<br>
given moment. Rarely do we try to compare two perspectives<br>
simultaneously, and it might be considered *currently* impossible for us<br>
to entertain three or more. We definitely cannot entertain ten<br>
perspectives simultaneously.  <br>
<p>
Our language is inundated with words and phrases which have or imply<br>
absolute meaning, condition, or equality. These words and phrases have<br>
gotten us this far, but in order to rise another level, in order to get<br>
a more useful sense of reality, one which accords more closely to<br>
reality, we are going to have to further develop our language. This<br>
includes the language of mathematics. <br>
<p>
I believe this shift will begin to further attentuate all authoritarian<br>
concepts and instituitions until such are no longer found useful to any<br>
degree. There will certainly be a myriad of other contributing factors,<br>
but many of these other factors will also be enabled by the same<br>
increased ability to entertain more variables and more perspectives<br>
simultaneously.<br>
<p>
Until we have developed more in this fashion, I do not believe that my<br>
theory of functionality over truth can be applied in every instance. But<br>
seeing the value in it, we can begin by attentuating our use of absolute<br>
terminology and enhancing our use of conditional terminology. We might<br>
imagine this as a mental workout, attempting to deal with more<br>
variables. <br>
<p>
Part of our problem with dealing with a great number of variables in any<br>
given moment is our capacity for memory. In attempting and then failing<br>
to employ more variables at any given time we will be driven to<br>
understand and thus enhance our memory further. It has been shown<br>
scientifically that subliminals can be used to enhance our memory quite<br>
drastically ... yet few people employ them.    <br>
     <br>
It has also been demonstrated how our emotions have a great deal to do<br>
with how well we store information in our memory, thus again further<br>
reason to broaden our focus to inclued emotive modalitities of<br>
consciousness. Greater control of our emotions will allow us to more<br>
effectively employ our memory.<br>
<p>
Conditional statements taken to the extreme continue in infinite<br>
regress. The idea here is just to incrementally strive for more, to go a<br>
little further along the causal path.<br>
<p>
<p>
Deconstruction of the absolute via percieving its conditionality:<br>
 <br>
Most<br>
Absolute : Z = Z<br>
<p>
   .     : if Y then Z<br>
<p>
   .     : if V then X, then Y, then Z<br>
<p>
More     : If (If A then B, then C) and If (V then X, then Y,) then Z<br>
Conditional    <br>
<p>
As we develop it will become easier for us to think more conditionally,<br>
less absolutely, and thus more accurately.<br>
<p>
The 4 questions you have posed for me John attempt to rhetorically<br>
revert me to the absolute. "Is your statement true or false?" I do not<br>
wish to answer true or false, I want to answer conditionally,<br>
functionally. I want to go beyond the use of absolute terminology. I<br>
admit this will be difficult and not *fully* possible right here and<br>
now, but neither is immortality, but we still strive for it. We are<br>
dynamically optimistic we can attain to it. In many ways my proposed<br>
shift can still prove useful today, with our limited capacity, even if<br>
it must be for the time considered "parasitic on the concept of truth"<br>
as George has called it.<br>

<i>&gt;         &gt;There is no reason to use the term truth when speaking of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;functionality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have 4 questions for you:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Is the sentence of yours I quote TRUE?</i><br>
<p>
Within my system it is neither true nor false. It is more or less<br>
functional. We apply the sentence in order to determine its degree of<br>
functionality in relation to other sentences. It does not matter if it<br>
is true or false. Those are not terms within the system. Reverting to<br>
truth in this case would be like taking Einsteins theory of relativity<br>
which is created in terms of pure geometry and trying to revert to<br>
Newton's terms of forces. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Is it TRUE that your sentence expresses a useful idea?</i><br>
<p>
Within my system it is neither true nor false. By degree, the sentence<br>
is more or less functional in expressing a functional idea. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) If the answer to either question #1 or question #2 is "yes" then is your</i><br>
<i>&gt;    sentence self contradictory?</i><br>
<p>
The answer was neither yes nor no. It cannot be reduced to something so<br>
black and white and absolute. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 4) If the answer to either question #1 or question #2 is "no" then why did    you write your</i><br>
<i>&gt;    sentence?</i><br>
<p>
The answer was neither yes or no. I wrote my sentence for functionality.<br>
<p>
<p>
Part of the confusion here lies in the word "is". In your system "is"<br>
means equals, or more accurately conjectures to be equal, and either a=b<br>
is true or a=b is false.<br>
<p>
In my system, "is" expresses a functional relationship, not an absolute<br>
relationship of equality. As well "=" expresses a functinal<br>
relationship, not an abosulte relationship of equality.<br>
<p>
if we are counting objects: 1+1=2 <br>
if two people are copulating to create a child: 1+1=3<br>
if we are expressing mystical union: 1+1=1<br>
<p>
It is not functional to say that these are contradictory, they are<br>
merely being applied in different contexts. We have just broadened the<br>
application of mathematics, allowing it to deal with metaphorical<br>
isomorphisms, without hurting its orignal limited use.<br>
<p>
Our language itself is saturated in terms of equality. Though it is a<br>
stepping stone, functional for the initial development of science,<br>
logic, and mathematics, I believe that a gradual shift towards<br>
conditional terms and terms of degree rather than terms of absolute<br>
relationship would be to our benefit [would be useful]. <br>
<p>
Our language determines our perception of reality. Words such as the<br>
following engender a black and white percption of the world instead of a<br>
greyscale perception:<br>
<p>
Is, are, was, equal, equate, exactly, proven, intrinsic.<br>
<p>
<p>
(3+4)=(4+3) We can say that these absolutely equal each other, but<br>
really, there is a slight difference. The difference is in the order of<br>
the addition of the numbers. Now, in most cases this difference would<br>
not matter, but perhaps we could imagine a situation where it might,<br>
particularly if we are using mathematics in a more metaphorical sense.<br>
Instead of saying 3+4 equals 4+3, we might say 3+4 functions as 4+3, but<br>
4+3 might in some circumstances function more as 4+3.<br>
<p>
  seconds: 0        --&gt;       1.5<br>
statement: Gregory equals Gregory<br>
<p>
In the time it took me to make this statement, which most people would<br>
consider self-evident, Gregory changed. The quantity of<br>
neuro-transmitters in his central nervous system changed, his pulse and<br>
temperature probably changed, his position in relation to celestial<br>
bodies changed. Our current level of abstraction lacks subtlety. It is<br>
not an exact science.<br>
<p>
Abstraction is necessary. I just think we have taken it too far towards<br>
absolute terms. <br>
<p>
I am going to attempt a sort of discipline which entails that whenever I<br>
become aware of myself making an absolute statement, I am going to<br>
attempt to make it more of a conditional statement, and more of a<br>
statement of degree, than I would have if I were not concerned about<br>
it.   <br>
<p>
Many might argue that this will needlessly complexify my thought, speech<br>
and writing. But I would argue, that if employed regularly, this<br>
discipline will likely engender my ability to employ a greater number of<br>
variables, while likely reducing the potential that someone will<br>
misunderstand me due to an over-abstraction, and thus<br>
over-simplification of that which I am communicating. We all probably do<br>
this to a degree, but how about a few more degrees? ... and then a few<br>
more. Perhaps in this fashion we might be able to reach the hypothetical<br>
singularity with less reliance on computers.<br>
<p>
I had a philosophy teacher get pissed off at me once for saying "I<br>
believe, or I feel such and such." He said, "Be assertive, state what<br>
you think as if it were a fact!" I then noticed, that yes, this is how<br>
most philosophers write, stating beliefs as if they were absolute facts<br>
or truths. I *believe* this sort of authoritarian thinking is one of the<br>
things limiting our ability to move onward towards higher levels of<br>
emotive, intuitive, and cognitive conditionality.<br>
<p>
Many people complain about making things to relative, but we haven't<br>
even hardly begun to move towards relativity, not to mention to find a<br>
balance between it and absolutism.<br>
<p>
F=Our focus<br>
A=Absolute Absolutism<br>
R=Absolute Relativity<br>
<p>
A &lt;--- F -------------------------------------- [...] -----&gt; R<br>
<p>
We are in part limited in our range of position along this spectrum by<br>
our capacity of consciousness, the number of variables we can<br>
simultaneously deal with, and the number of distinct perspectives we can<br>
simultaneously deal with. We are held in place by the limitations of our<br>
language which entail the limitations of our perception.<br>
<p>
I am seeking subtle precision, precision in the subtleties of our<br>
thought, speech, and writing. This precision will move us closer in<br>
accord with our dynamic reality and further from authoritarian and<br>
overly abstracted absolutes such as truth.                      <br>
<p>
