Just in case some may think that I mean my definition of "extropy" is a<br>
singular or mystical quality - well, no, it's been designed to avoid it.<br>
First, I have defined it as a subjective quality, like beauty or morality,<br>
not a Pirsigian capital-Q Quality. This definition isn't mystical unless<br>
you consider subjectivity mystical.<br>
<p>
Next, I chose "the quality of creative order CHARACTERISTIC of living<br>
systems" rather than a more restrictive phrase, such as, perhaps, "... that<br>
DISTINGUISHES living systems." The "quality of creative order" that I hope<br>
to indicate appears in some systems that some would more strictly consider<br>
non-living, or even quite abstract, from economic systems to computer<br>
systems.<br>
<p>
By the way, though David Musick clearly understand this already, I<br>
recommend Stephen Levy's terrific book, "Artifical Life", if you need to<br>
relax your boundaries in the living vs non-living "mock controversy", or<br>
need help figuring out what's interesting about life. (Hint: it's not a<br>
single feature.)<br>
