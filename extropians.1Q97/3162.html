I enjoyed tonight's episode because of the neato 3D graphics, the guest<br>
appearance of Neil Stephenson (I loved Snow Crash) and the demonstration of<br>
a fully functional metaverse w/avatars, good graphics, and realtime voice<br>
to clear up the public &amp; media's concept of virtual reality. I am intrigued<br>
by the idea of having fuel offboard and beaming it to a flying craft of<br>
sorts by microwave or laser. How much energy is lost in the process? I am<br>
also highly skeptical about any vehicle at all based on solar or wind power<br>
with the technology currently being so weak or expensive to manufacture.<br>
Comeon, a commercial airline-type craft fueled by ion propulsion? It would<br>
be too slow to be viable and did they even explain how you get it in the<br>
air in the first place? I disliked how they had an image of an alien in the<br>
opening because it labels the whole show for UFO fanatics and other<br>
miscellaneous wierdos. Another thing i disliked was that antigravity device<br>
that the Navy turned down due to saying it was an anomoly, that just says<br>
crackpot written all over it. (And I know Mike Lorrey is going to fight me<br>
on this statement). Another thing i had a problem with is that they didn't<br>
go into either side of the teleportation problem, destructive vs<br>
deconstruct/reconstruct teleportation. I for one will not want to travel<br>
with destructive teleporation except for my body, I'd prefer nanites to<br>
carry my brain or perhaps transport it through a miniature controlled<br>
wormhole? I believe that an atom's physical location (although being<br>
undetectable) is a vital element in transporting a living intelligent<br>
object such as an individual. In other words, my atoms are mine. MINE!<br>
MINE! MINE! I look forward to tomorrow's episode on Robotics. Does anyone<br>
know what episodes Max &amp; Natasha are in?<br>
