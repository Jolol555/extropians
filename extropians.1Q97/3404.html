<i>&gt;This reflects more about your own obvious lack of understanding of Extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt;concepts (as your dogma,  pessimism and rantings about the future show) Next</i><br>
<i>&gt;time,  perhaps try and contribute rather than flail away in anger or sadness</i><br>
<i>&gt;or whatever emotional conflicts this future (and IMO very tender sounding )</i><br>
<i>&gt;piece of art brings up in you...</i><br>
<p>
The reason I have not already replied to your messages is due to the false<br>
hope you would stop sending them. I have never seen a series of messages so<br>
totally self-righteous and off base. You have no idea who I am, and there's<br>
no way you could, yet you analyse me. I would appreciate if you kept your<br>
immature, uniformed, and insulting pop psychobable to yourself. You have no<br>
right to judge me, only my ideas.<br>
