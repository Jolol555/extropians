Open Air Space Habitats<br>
<p>
    A home in space need not be the enclosed volume usually described in most movies, <br>
books and articles. If a strong enough material is used, a rotating cylinder can be so large <br>
that it holds an entire atmosphere against its inner surface. The only example this author <br>
knows of is Larry Niven's "Ringworld", a ring the diameter of Earth's orbit, circling a sun, <br>
and wide enough to contain oceans and continents. It, unfortunately, had to be built of <br>
"Unobtainium" to perform this mighty feat.<br>
     We now have a material close at hand that can do something like this, albeit on a much <br>
smaller scale. The smaller the diameter of the rotating ring or cylinder, the less demands <br>
are put on its main structural material. Instead of encircling a star, we can now contem-<br>
plate building artificial worlds with land areas comparable to Earth that are open to <br>
space- a feature we've grown accustomed to on this world.<br>
     This fabulous new material is the long sought Carbon-Carbon chain molecule. Its <br>
existence was posited several decades ago, but no one knew how to make it. The answer <br>
turned out to be one of those delicious tales of scientific discovery, like Goodyear stumbling<br>
 on vulcanization. We've come to know of a "third form" of pure Carbon, not <br>
diamond nor graphite. This "new"-to us- stuff is called Buckminsterfullerene, or <br>
Buckyballs and Buckytubes. Now that we know what to look for, this stuff has turned up <br>
in four billion year old meteorites, interstellar gas clouds, and right here on Earth: in <br>
ordinary candle soot, where it was discovered occuring naturally.<br>
    With the clarity of hindsight, it is obvious that a "sheet" of ordinary graphite could be <br>
rolled up and joined to form tube- I'll wager someone thought of it many years ago. What <br>
is amazing about this is that it happens all the time, naturally. Now comes the hard part- <br>
make the tube really, really long, and do it at thousand ton per second rates. The "really <br>
long" part is being avidly pursued, and we might see meter-long samples this year (1997). <br>
This in turn may well spawn an industry that replaces "Carbon Fiber" (also mis-named <br>
"Graphite Fiber") with the real thing. The first products will probably be military, aero and <br>
spacecraft parts, as was the case with Carbon Fiber. Then come the bicycle frames, tennis <br>
rackets, golf  clubs and such. These products will weigh perhaps half of an equivalent <br>
Carbon Fiber part. More importantly, they establish "Buckyfiber" (which should have been <br>
called "Graphite Fiber") as a viable, nanotech industry.<br>
    To make this material in the quantities we really want, some parts of the production <br>
have to be done by self-replicated tools, or 'Special Assemblers". The nice thing about <br>
"Graphenes" (Buckytubes) is they self-assemble to a large extent (cf.  "candle flame"). <br>
Therefore, the Special Assembler does not need to do direct, positional-control chemistry <br>
on the forming tube, it only needs to mediate, or catalyze, the process, and move the <br>
finished end of the tube along and out of the way, where more conventional machinery can  <br>
take over. Since this is essentially a one-dimensional product (like wire or yarn), the <br>
Special Assemblers can be arranged in a plane, with the Buckyfibers emanating <br>
perpendicular to that plane.<br>
     Given the above capabilities, we can now speak of creating new worlds. In this <br>
example, we'll make a 1000 kilometer diameter world, just for fun. A space-based <br>
industrial capacity, having the tremendous resources of just the inner Solar System at its <br>
disposal, along with some nanotech self-replication capabilities, can do this kind of thing.<br>
    Beginning with the alluded to giant spools of Buckyfiber, a cylindrical structure can be <br>
"filament-wound" in deep space. To do this, one need a rotating mandrel, or round mold, <br>
to wind the fiber onto. This can be made in several different ways. One is to start with a <br>
long, thin, superconducting wire, formed into a loop, and charge it with an electric <br>
current. It then naturally springs out to form a near-perfect circle. Using several of these <br>
connected together in a row, and reinforced with Buckyfiber-cloth, makes a short cylinder, <br>
say 100 meters long by 1000 km diameter. This now can be brought up to some rotational <br>
speed in several ways. One efficient way is to build two worlds at the same time, spinning <br>
in opposite directions, and use a motor between them.<br>
    The gathered ends of Buckyfibers are led off of the spools (which are also spinning) and <br>
brought to rendezvous with the outer surface of the spinning hoop. The shell is wound to <br>
a thickness of perhaps a few centimeters. Depending on the masses (moments of inertia), <br>
allowable fiber tensions, rotational speeds of the hoop and spools and so on, the hoop can <br>
be made to slow down as the fiber runs out. Now the supercurrent is quenched, allowing <br>
the mandrel to go somewhat slack (it still has some centrifugal force pushing it against the <br>
new Buckyfiber cylinder). The mandrel is released from the inner surface of the new <br>
cylinder wall, and moved along another 100 meters or so, like a concrete slip-form. <br>
Another gang of Buckyfiber spools is brought  in and the process repeated. After doing <br>
this a few hundred times, we are left with a big, thin, slowly spinning clyinder, say 500 km <br>
long and 1000 km diameter, having almost two million square kilometers of new land. <br>
This now can be used as the mandrel for the rest of the construction.<br>
   Leaving this cylinder spinning slowly, we bring in fleets of these Buckytube spools. The <br>
fiber should be wound at a slight angle, maybe 10 degrees, which means we need a shuttle, <br>
like on a loom. This might have to be rocket propelled, like a Shuttle. Another way is to <br>
build a 500 kilometer beam with the shuttles on it that sits in space next to the cylinder. <br>
The shell needs to be about three meters thick for structural reasons, and another three <br>
meters of slag should be sprayed on the outside, for radiation protection. The atmosphere-<br>
to-be will provide the same radiation protection topsides that Earth's air does.<br>
   After winding the main bulk of this world, we have to consider what to do about the <br>
ends. As this is an "open-air" design, the ends only have to come up from the cylinder wall <br>
about 150 kilometers, and can be very thin near the top, as will be the enclosed <br>
atmosphere. These end walls can be made by wrapping the fiber over the edge of the <br>
cylinder, letting it run in a straight line for a ways across the open end, then wrapping back <br>
<p>
up onto the cylinder. Using a thin plastic membrane across the end, with a small amount of <br>
air inside for pressurization, can help make the end rounded, as they ideally should be.<br>
After the main shell is built, the rest of the atmosphere can be brought in, the nitrogen and <br>
oxygen distilled from asteroids and cometary nuclei. Oceans are easy; there is lots of <br>
accessible water ice strewn about in asteroids and small moons, out past Earth's orbit. <br>
Mountains ranges might be added to the ends, where the walls rise to hold the <br>
atmosphere.<br>
   The interior volume of this world can be left open to space, meaning each point on the <br>
interior living surface has about 150 Km of atmosphere above it, and then 700 Km of <br>
nothing. Looking upward, at an angle, one can still see the stars.<br>
   That was a lot of work, but what is a World worth?<br>
