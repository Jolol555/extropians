In a message dated 97-01-25 01:32:41 EST, you write:<br>

&lt;&lt;  <br>
 :   [PS  Nadia, are you with us on this thread?  Imagining grids of points,<br>
    <br>
 :   and having them light up in various patterns and colors, is the <br>
 :   connection between art and mathematics.  Mathematics, when you learn <br>
 :   to see it as it is, is like a laser show in a cathedral full of<br>
mirrors.]  <br>

sigh......<br>

Lyle, I wish I could see math like that, you have no idea,  I would give<br>
anything to be able to, I am trying like hell to overcome my math blocks, I<br>
am one of those "poor dears" who never got encouraged in math  (and I can do<br>
it when i do audio engineering and write musical arrangements, so I know it<br>
is not hopeless) Howeever, I am working hard (no, I havent gotten TB from it<br>
to date) to go back and learn, I am doingit, not just for applied uses, but<br>
to understand the beauty and power of math. It is my dream, and the way you<br>
speak of it really enhances my desire to know it.<br>
<p>
The thing you describe above almost makes me want to cry, it sounds so<br>
magnificence, but then there are those who say words shouldn't bring<br>
emotion....<br>
