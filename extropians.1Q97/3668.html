<i>&gt;Also, some of Sarah's questions are answered, briefly yet cogently, in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Transhumanist and Extropic Art FAQ which can be read at my URL. Here I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;stated by degrees how art can be considered extropic by the creative author</i><br>
<i>&gt;as well as the audience.  </i><br>
<p>
I didn't raise any specific questions in my post: were you thinking of any<br>
which arise implicitly or by extrapolation?<br>
<p>
Also, although the FAQs are very well-written and informative in describing<br>
Transhumanist and Extropian Art, they don't address themselves to the<br>
specific issue raised by my posts. They could be used to allow a<br>
consideration of some of my general points in the more specific area of<br>
these forms of art, but they don't directly confirm or deny my statements.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip - description of Extropic art: forms, intentions, rationale...&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, with the above information as the starting point for creative work,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is a continuous balance, just as there is in life and with every</i><br>
<i>&gt;decision that we make, whether *art* or not.</i><br>
<p>
My point being that observers may not have any of that information, and are<br>
therefore free to create their own interpretations which may be entirely at<br>
odds with that of the artist. This is no big news, nor a criticism of art,<br>
nor a call for censorship: merely, an observation yet to be refuted.<br>
