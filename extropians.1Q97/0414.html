<i>&gt; I'm not sure what you think the Internet has to do with anarchy. It was</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed in the United States with government funding and functions at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the pleasure of a multitude of governments. Please clarify why you think</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Internet is an anarchy, I'm curious.</i><br>
 <br>
Usenet, BITNET, FIDOnet, and ARPAnet all evolved independently, and<br>
only the last with govrnment funding.  When it was proposed to<br>
connect them, the APRA protocols were found to be the most flexible,<br>
so those were used as the standard to which the others were adapted.<br>
Since then, the number of independent commercial networks, foreign<br>
networks, and others that have been connected completely dwarf the<br>
few remaining dregs of ARPAnet that remain--and ARPAnet never did<br>
have any kind of "control" over anyone else's machine.  90% of the<br>
users on today's internet are subscribers to commercial services<br>
like AOL, CompuServe, and Netcom, carrying 90% of their bandwidth<br>
on commercial carriers like Sprint and AT&amp;T.  The government's<br>
role started small and vanished completely.<br>
<p>
Every single, individual, host on the Internet is completely<br>
autonomous and free.  Any machine has complete freedom to send any<br>
packet it chooses, and to ignore any packet it chooses, and to<br>
connect to any other host that is willing to connect with it.  There<br>
is no central authority of any kind for any service--email, news,<br>
the Web, FTP sites, and all other services are the result of free<br>
individual hosts agreeing to transmit traffic in certain ways.<br>
When people abuse the system, such as mass bombing of commercial<br>
mail and news, no central authority restrains them; the individual<br>
hosts agree upon ways to minimize such traffic by enforcing<br>
contractual agreements upon their users, configuring their software<br>
to make it difficult to do and easy to remove, and as a last<br>
resort by simply using their autonomous authority to ignore and<br>
not propogate the offender (e.g., the "Usenet Death Penalty").<br>
<p>
Each of the foreign nets has its own rules--or might not--but has<br>
no authority to affect what anyone sends or receives.  Even within<br>
their own borders they cannot help but allow traffic that might<br>
otherwise be against their laws (German servers can't help but<br>
send Neo-Nazi mail and chat; Muslim hosts propagate pornography<br>
just as efficiently as Swedish ones). <br>
<p>
Even the one serious attempt by the US legislature to proffer<br>
some control over the Net was properly slapped down by enlightened<br>
judges in Philadelphia.  The only laws of any kind that apply to<br>
Internet traffic are those that apply generally to any communication<br>
medium and to any business enterprize: you can get arrested in the<br>
US for sending child porn or in Iran for sending blasphemy--assuming<br>
you are stupid enough to not use sufficient encryption, which yet<br>
another enlightened judge has helped free from regulation.<br>
<p>
Email, Usenet, the Web, and all other Internet services operate<br>
as wonderful spontaneously-ordered anarchies.  Whatever control<br>
there is is by /unanimous/ consent of the controlled, and there are<br>
no attempts to force control on those not consenting (except, of<br>
course, by freely choosing not to connect to them).  The fact that<br>
it gets good work done without major problems is indeed the finest<br>
testament to the efficacy of anarchy man has yet produced.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You are committing the naturalistic fallacy here. Just because a price</i><br>
<i>&gt; would naturally be X in a free market doesn't mean the price SHOULD be</i><br>
<i>&gt; X. Likewise, government frequently attempts to do good things (space</i><br>
<i>&gt; travel, quick economic recovery, for example) that would not happen in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; free market. That doesn't mean they OUGHT NOT to happen.</i><br>
<p>
What subjectivist nonsense.  You are postulating what you seek to<br>
prove: i.e., that non free-market results can be good.  Where is your<br>
proof that the free market cannot prduce all that is possible and <br>
necessary for mankind?  And by what standard of morality do you<br>
measure such things?  Please state the premise of your morality before<br>
attempting to show that the free market does not meet it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I must not get your point. How does cryptography keep me from paying</i><br>
<i>&gt; property tax on my home, license tax on my car, income tax on my salary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or sales tax collected by CompUSA?</i><br>
<p>
As the information economy becomes more and more prominent in your<br>
life, the physical things like cars, food, and housing will become an<br>
increasingly smaller part of the economy (but not absent, as you<br>
point out).  When most of your productivity is done by telecommuting<br>
from home, and most of the cybercash you earn there is spent on the<br>
net for more information-based goods and services, those parts of the<br>
economy will become less and less traceable.  And even trades for<br>
physical goods can be arranged by encrypted conversation--how can the<br>
IRS find out that I traded a bushel of my Zucchini for a bushel of<br>
my neighbor's tomatoes, or that I traded an hour of Java programming<br>
for a meal at a restaurant I found on the net and negotiated the<br>
trade with in complete secrecy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sorry for the lack of clarity. I meant the state of anarchy. That is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; what is to prevent someone from setting up a government once your</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchy is established?</i><br>
<p>
This is anarchy 101.  In an A-C society, and protection agency that<br>
tries to establish itself as a monopoly can only do so by attacking<br>
its competitors by force at great expense.  By doing so, it opens<br>
itself up to getting a bad reputation and violent opposition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have trouble even getting into your head on this one, John. What the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazis did WAS essentially anarchic. They illegally whipped up a bunch of</i><br>
<i>&gt; support for executing the Holocaust. How would it be any different under</i><br>
<i>&gt; an anarchy? And before modern enlightened government, slavery was common</i><br>
<i>&gt; and "natural."</i><br>
<p>
Hitler came to power legally, under the existing rules of an established<br>
government.  Every executive order he gave was quite legal.  No anarchy<br>
here, just government as usual.  And if you seriously propose to tell<br>
me that it was government that ended slavery and not individuals, then<br>
you need to read some /real/ history and not what they spoon-feed you<br>
in US high school history courses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't recall the United States butchering hundreds of millions of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; own citizens this century. It seems to me that the butchering is on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; decline as governments become more enlightened, no?</i><br>
<p>
Change that to "as the /people/ become more enlightened" and we agree.<br>
Before you try to argue against anarcho=capitalism, you really ought to<br>
read the basic tracts on it to better argue the real points and not your<br>
misunderstanding of it.  <br>
