Correction (kinda):  The innervation patterns are critically dependent on<br>
interaction between tissue and nerve, mostly in the womb and very early<br>
childhood.  No interaction, no useful mapping.  The genes are short of the<br>
necessary information to specify all connections, by many orders of<br>
magnitude.<br>
<p>
Also, identical genes do *not* generate identical body patterns.  Very<br>
similar on the macro level, yes, but on a cell-by-cell level quite different.<br>
 You couldn't switch brain parts even of identical twins from the same womb.<br>
<p>

<p>
Nope.  You'd have to microsurgically attach every optic and auditory, and<br>
many tactile, nerve cells, individually.  Some won't match up to the new body<br>
plan and will be useless, dying shortly after the transplantation.  Some<br>
systems do regrow on their own - I know the pain system does.  But most<br>
don't.<br>
<p>
"Replacement bodies" is not an impossible task, but it's not near-term<br>
either.<br>
<p>
One serious problem with serial cloning is that cells accumulate genetic<br>
errors with time.  I think the rate is about one mutation to active genetic<br>
material per generation.  So any cell from your body would have at least a<br>
few dozen genetic errors, all of which get inherited by the clone.  Part of<br>
the point of sexual reproduction is to clear all this mess up.<br>
