Well, I finally went to the Extropians dinner meeting and I must say it was<br>
COOL. People I remember meeting were, obviously Max and Natasha, Natasha's<br>
friend (I don't recall the name who will hopefully soon showup on the<br>
list), and QueenMUSE who looks exactly like someone else I know. For you<br>
lurkers out there and people 'geographically-challenged', I must say that<br>
these people are exceedingly friendly (not to the point of annoying) and<br>
things went far better than I imagined although I must admit I was a bit<br>
nervous. I look forward to the next one and hope more of you show up.<br>
Perhaps we could even get a group photo? Ahh yes! How about a group photo<br>
that could be taken at EXTRO-3 with an image map that would be placed on<br>
the ExI webpage and allow you to click on the individual people to send<br>
email? It would be a far better method than my haphazard photo/email<br>
directory on my Ethereal Outlook website.<br>
