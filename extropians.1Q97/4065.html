["]This brings to mind an interesting question.  Is the clone to be held<br>
["]responsible for crimes (real crimes, like murder) which were committed by the<br>
["]"original" sometime just prior to duplication?  For example, if I murdered my<br>
["]wife (I wouldn't &amp; I'm not currently married, but for the sake of an<br>
["]example...), and then I duplicated myself, and then the law enforcement<br>
["]officers (whatever kind then exists) arrive to arrest the perpatrator, who do<br>
["]they arrest?  I ask because if the answer is that only the original is<br>
["]arrested, then criminal types by the dozens would flock to duplication<br>
["]chambers everywhere, as to avoid (at least on one line of existence)<br>
["]prosicution.  On the other hand, if both the "original" and the cloned copy<br>
["]were to be prosicuted, then they would need to be put on trial together, a<br>
["]"strange" arrangement.  Any comments or answers?<br>
<p>
I would say that they would both be accountable for their past actions<br>
(before the cloning), so therefore they should both be put on trial<br>
together. Furthermore, I think that the resources of the original should<br>
be divided equally with the clone, as the clone was just as responsible<br>
for achiveing the wealth as the original.<br>
<p>
["]<br>
["]On another note, I believe the entire idea of punishment as it is known today<br>
["]will one day become obsolete.  When you "punish" someone, it does not improve<br>
["]or change the crime that has been committed.  The real answer, I believe,<br>
["]lies is changing the fundamental reason the crime was committed (I mean real<br>
["]crime - force, fraud, coercion), thus preventing future crimes, while<br>
["]maintaining the person's ability to be a productive individual.  In our<br>
["]techno-advanced future, these crimes will be eliminated by neural<br>
["]restructuring or some such thing.  This may bring up the question of prisons<br>
["]in the future, before everyone has been "uncriminalized", would it be<br>
["]permissable, or objectively OK, to make neural modifications by force to<br>
["]criminals?  This would be preferable, I believe, to death or prison.  I hope<br>
["]this brings many comments.  Thanks for listening.<br>
["]<br>
<p>
For serious offenses, prison with the option of assisted suicide is the<br>
most humane thing to do. As for neural modifications, I would doubt that<br>
they would be effective, without destroying the victims personality.<br>
I see this as not only death, but perhaps torture as well.<br>
