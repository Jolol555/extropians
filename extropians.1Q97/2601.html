Hal notes:<br>
&lt;Sometimes after an intense dream I awaken, and for a few moments it <br>
is hard to reconcile the memories from the dream (which sometimes <br>
include events which supposedly took place before the dream began) <br>
with my real memories.  Maybe this experience would be similar to <br>
merging two disjoint sets of  memories as you describe.&gt;<br>
<p>
I think you're definitely onto something here.<br>
<p>
For me, dreaming is usually a fairly disembodied experience, in the <br>
sense that even when dreaming of movement I can usually ignore bodily <br>
mechanisms involved (gravity and balance don't seem to be important). <br>
 It's also primarily a subjective flow of sensation or communication, <br>
certainly without alot of planning or reflection (though the times <br>
when I notice these activities are very interesting). Usually the most <br>
intriguing parts of the dream are the strange feelings and the odd <br>
events or environments being witnessed.<br>
<p>
In other words, the dreaming state may be a very useful model for what <br>
it might be like if we could tap into another person's mind - or if we <br>
were receiving sensations from multiple robotic agents or virtual <br>
selves on the Net.<br>
<p>
I also notice that there is a mechanism in my mind, rarely under <br>
normal conscious control, though somehow exercisable, by which my <br>
regular waking minds recall dreams - sometimes the dreams are 'right <br>
there' and it's trivial to recall them; other times I have to make a <br>
concerted effort to find a thread that will lead me back into the <br>
series of dream events. Sort of a hashing and thrashing exercise, <br>
between trying to avoid immediate flushing of the dream registers, <br>
ignoring the stack of day-ahead planning thoughts my rational mind is <br>
starting to pop, while still retaining the intentional and analytical <br>
capabilities of the wakened mind.<br>
<p>
Whatever this dream-recall mechanism is, some analogue of it is likely <br>
to be an essential, controllable skill for integrating <br>
sub-personalities as an upload, for being able to navigate during <br>
intense VR immersion, or for maintaining identity during the kind of <br>
mind-to-mind linking you were describing.<br>
