<i>&gt;        If there are any orthodoxically stringent literary buffs on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;list, I warn you...I swear in this poem.</i><br>
<p>
Not a problem. That is the newmedia way. Use swearing to grab attention and<br>
draw people into emotional alignment with the author and simultaneously use<br>
high-end vocabulary. It puts an end to the idea that people who use swear<br>
words don't have a good grasp of the english language. It's only when<br>
you're using them in every other word that that applies. Swear words are<br>
words of coarse raw emotion. Take a look at Wired for example and<br>
occasionally Cnet.<br>
<p>
A idea just popped into my head, Is there any possible way to tap into the<br>
Earth as a power source? I've heard that we now know that the core spins<br>
rapidly compared to the crush so is it possible to somehow harness that<br>
spinning or perhaps the spinning of the planet itself with some sort of<br>
skyhook?<br>

intelligence." -Timothy Leary (1979)<br>
