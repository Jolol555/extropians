My apologies. I accidentally hit the "Send" button on this before it was<br>
finished. I may or may not have stopped it before it was sent. If you<br>
have read the beginning of this Email already, plese scroll down to the<br>
"------------". This is the point I was at when the mishap occurred. I<br>
think I stopped it though.<br>

"Nothing gets justified...everything get criticized." [Bartley, 112]<br>
<p>
Pure Rationality seems to have become the ontotheological god or<br>
absolute of Pancritical Rationalism (PCR). This Rationality can be<br>
criticized, but it must be criticized with Rationality. Is this not<br>
circular? PCR seems to be yet another failed attempt at removing the<br>
authority, the authority being attenutauted very well in most areas, but<br>
then magnified and exalted in Rationality. <br>
<p>
"By replacing justificationism with fallibilism, and by encouraging the<br>
practice of opening to, welcoming, and respecting criticism,<br>
pancritical rationalism maximizes the pursuit of truth [...]" [More]<br>
<p>
What is truth? It will take some effort to convice me that truth is not<br>
a religious concept. This is another exogenous sublimation of god. I<br>
don't think science can say anything about truth. You said, "nothing is<br>
*provable* in science, only refutable". Is truth refutable? How do we<br>
know that in our pursuit for truth that we have attained it or not? I<br>
see a disparancy here between your thought and that of PCR. To overcome<br>
authority, as PCR attempts to do, I think you might have to replace<br>
"truth" with something like "the next most functional", or "the next<br>
most useful". Sure, this is only a further sublimation, but at least it<br>
is something science can actually deal with. Science is about<br>
prediction, the terms it uses to create theories of prediction are just<br>
as fanciful as those of any mythology. The terms of science do not<br>
necessarily exist, but that does not matter. What matters is, does any<br>
particular scientific theory allow us to predict something, and is there<br>
a competing theory which more accurately predicts the same. We cannot<br>
attain truth or meaning from science. Rationality is the almighty tool<br>
for developing theories of prediction, but we cannot attain truth or<br>
meaning from rationality. I point out your desire for truth as an<br>
inconsistancy in your system. Fortunately the extropian system is "open"<br>
to revision. Though rationality is certainly not inconsistent with your<br>
system, I am going to attempt to criticize it while showing how it could<br>
be augmented with other modalities of consciousness.<br>

"This optimism [Dynamic Optimism] is dynamic since it rejects any form<br>
of passive faith." [More]<br>
<p>
Dynamic Optimism is the same as dynamic faith. Where exoteric religion<br>
tends to be biased towards passive faith, esoteric religion certainly is<br>
not.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Contrary to faith, dynamic optimism recommends experimentation to<br>
uncover the truth" [More]<br>
<p>
How would esoteric religion have ever developed without embracing<br>
experimentation?<br>

<i>&gt; I understand why you would say this, but whenever I hear this view it makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; me choke! Confusing the boundaries of religion and science only plays into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the hands of those who want to maintain their irrational approaches to</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking.</i><br>
<p>
Are those boundaries absolute? Is there a dogmatic and unquestionable<br>
boundary separating religion and science? Is it really that black and<br>
white? In your article on PCR you criticized Rand for sharply defining<br>
everything as black and white. This was in a different context, but does<br>
that criticism not hold here?<br>
<p>
<p>
Lets take "artificial intelligence". There is a definite bias here for<br>
intelligence. "Cognitive science" has the same bias. Perhaps artificial<br>
consciousness would be better, for consciousness is certainly more than<br>
intelligence alone. Is intelligence anything more than refined, highly<br>
articulated emotion?<br>
<p>
      emotive --&gt; intuitive --&gt; cognitive <br>
      subtle    --&gt;    highly articulated   <br>
<p>
How are we going to create something intelligent when we are not<br>
starting with the basics? We should be more concerned with making<br>
something feel need and desire before we attempt to make something<br>
intelligent. <br>
<p>
What is science fiction? Science fiction tends to inform this Elist a<br>
great deal. We quote people such as William Gibson as if they were<br>
authorities on science, when they are more like religious shamans and<br>
their stories are more like religious mythology; modern mythology. This<br>
sort of writing is often apcolyptical, or utopian. But what I like most<br>
about it is its focus on need and desire. Science fiction tends to be<br>
about either what we want to attain, or what we ought to avoid. Its not<br>
about truth. I feel that science fiction is an actual field of science,<br>
a field which ought to be further embraced and explored. It removes our<br>
focus from epistemological truth, and returns it to the emotions, to<br>
need and desire. Truth is of little importance. Effectivenes and<br>
functionality our much more important. Truth won't help me overcome my<br>
needs and attain my desires. I have no desire to attain truth. Its a<br>
worthless ontotheological concept to me. And again, this doesn't hurt<br>
science, because science is not even capable of speaking about truth.<br>
Science fiction helps us open our minds to potential where science<br>
without Science fiction is dead. Is imagination a rational mode of<br>
thought. I don't think so. Where would science be without imagination,<br>
yet science denies the use of it. Without imagination, intuition, and<br>
emotive passion, we would not have genius, but these things science<br>
refuses to incorporate. It pretends not to employ them. A scientist must<br>
be obsessively passionate, but his sciences itself is completely lacking<br>
in passion.  <br>
<p>
Lets look at the objective bias of science. This bias has left us wholly<br>
ignorant of our own endogenous realities. This is a real problem of<br>
science. It is wholly focused on the other, on the object, on the<br>
external. Here is where science could recursively learn something from<br>
religion. How can we create a new science which allows us to talk about<br>
endogenous worlds? The first thing it would have to do is to find a way<br>
to embrace emotion. Science attempts to speak about emotions but its not<br>
emotive. Science is cognitive and as such is only able to penetrate<br>
matters of a cognitive nature.<br>
<p>
Our education today is almost completely cognitive. But we do not have<br>
the maturity to deal with the knowledge and technology we have created<br>
via our intensive cognitive education. We need an emotive education to<br>
balance our cognitive education. Memetics is perhaps a small step in<br>
this direction. It amazes me how few people take responsibility for<br>
their emotions. People are constantly offended and embarrassed by my<br>
discussions with them. Thus they lose control of their emotions before<br>
we can reach any depth of meaning. If we taught people how to take<br>
responsibility for their emotions in school, this problem would be<br>
greatly attentuated. Education would be *more effective* augmented with<br>
emotive education. We need to teach people not to give others power of<br>
their emotions so easily. I should not be able to embarass someone I<br>
have only met 10 minutes ago. We need to become familiar with the<br>
subtleties of the emotive so that we can use it to empower and impassion<br>
our reason.<br>
<p>
I think this has a great deal to do with the lack of genius in our<br>
society. People lack emotive and intuitive discipline. Still, I am not<br>
confessing to know how these things could be synergized with science,<br>
but I can see very clearly the effect of their repression. Science is<br>
still lacking in many ways. <br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; No, religion is definitely not the foundation of science, and faith has no</i><br>
<i>&gt; role in science.</i><br>
<p>
That doesn't sound like a statement that can be criticized. Very<br>
dogmatic, but I believe I have done so above.<br>
<p>
I am impressed with the Extropian involvement in politics. This seems to<br>
help bridge the gap between science and politics. I believe this is a<br>
step in the right direction. By assimilating them they can work together<br>
and not against each other. Perhaps that is not the intention, but by<br>
bringing a particular kind of science and a particular kind of politics<br>
together under the umbrella of extropy you have created some sort of<br>
isomorphism between them. I would like to see this same sort of<br>
isomorphism begin between the cognitive, the intuitive, and the emotive.<br>
Truely I believe this will only propel science further.  <br>
<p>
Though you may feel like "choking" while reading my posts, I certainly<br>
appreciate your criticism. A lot of science is about taking risks. I am<br>
taking the risk of exploring this idea to see if there is anything to<br>
it. Perhaps not, but if there is it will certainly develop and become<br>
more refined with time. I am not suggesting a return to primitive<br>
concepts and modalities of consciousness, but rather a recursive and<br>
transcending re-assimilation of them. We have greatly refined<br>
rationalization, but its not enough. Just like an AI cannot understand<br>
analogies, if we were merely rational neither would we. We are able to<br>
understand obscure and poetic analogies because our memory makes<br>
irrational associations based on feelings, emotions, and patterns of<br>
sensation, as well as rational associations. <br>
