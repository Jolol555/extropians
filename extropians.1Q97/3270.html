I've heard of other digital cash schemes, before, also...  But they were<br>
all bound up in real currency.<br>
<p>
The perrenial problem has been the temptation to make lots<br>

<i>&gt; make some currency for each new participant, otherwise stagnation occurs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; So they therefore have the ability to wreck their own economy through</i><br>

<i>&gt; are the first to spend the new currency.</i><br>
<p>
I think I mentioned how it worked.  If not, here it is.  When you<br>
register your business/service at the gvb(global village bank), they<br>
drop 50 nella into your account.  When they have 1000 people signed up<br>
as service providers, they will put the businesses/services on their web<br>
page.  Then, if you need a service you can look around, and then buy<br>
their service.  So, yes they do have the ability to issue the currency<br>
to the people.  Remember, this is purely fictional currency.  The only<br>
material you can purchase is digital/intellectual property.  At least,<br>
that's the way it appears to me from their rules.  So, no, I could not<br>
buy a new sofa, for example.  I might be able to buy the designs for a<br>
sofa, but not the actual thing.  This is just an experiment, and I think<br>
it's something that goes along with extropian principles.  Especially<br>
the Spontaneous Order(I know, there's been some contention within the<br>
past couple weeks about that term)...  This project is starting out<br>
small, and perhaps it'll work, perhaps it'll fail.  But, what loss would<br>
there be to try it out, except, perhaps your time(although, you'd get<br>
someone else's time(created work) in return).  It's seems pretty<br>
anarchic and spontaneous to me.  People free to trade as they wish. <br>
I've already signed up.  I hope someone else at least thinks about it. <br>
Did you get to visit their page yet?  If not, I suggest to do so.  It's<br>
interesting, and it'll have the full scheme on how things work.  Also,<br>
you could ask the people who are setting it up your questions on<br>
inflation, etc...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In short, they have means and they have motive.  What guarantees to</i><br>
<i>&gt; they offer on their money supply?</i><br>
<p>
As I said, it's anarchic, spontaneous, and it doesn't exist.  It's<br>
voluntary, contractual agreement.  Once this thing gets going, I think<br>
it'll grow in a great way.<br>
