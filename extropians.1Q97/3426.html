One of the most interesting predictions/controversies was that the<br>
evolutionists claimed the age of the Earth was much more than the scant<br>
million years the physicists (and geologists) at the time believed. The<br>
physicists, led by Lord Kelvin, pointed out that if the planet was as old<br>
as the biologists claimed it would have to be in order to fit their<br>
evolution model and reasonable rates of species change, then it would have<br>
cooled off through thermal conduction until it was entirely solid, which<br>
it obviously wasn't the case (volcanoes). The evolutionists claimed <br>
something must be heating the Earth. <br>
<p>
This controversy was a real danger to evolution, but as the evolutionists <br>
had expected, a reasonable energy source was found (radioactive decay) <br>
and later evidence (from comparisions of drill cores and sediment <br>
layering) supported their model. A quite fine case of how a scientific <br>
controversy in the long run forced new research.<br>
