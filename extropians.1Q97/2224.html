It's hard to believe, but when you read Simon's books he really does<br>
present his case convincingly.  I am now much less gung-ho about<br>
environmental issues than I was before I read his stuff.<br>
<p>
Of course you are going to find places where things are bad.  The<br>
important question is, what is the *overall* situation? After all, if<br>
you're going to be spending billions of dollars on supposedly preventative<br>
measures, you ought to get your facts right.  <br>
<p>
And when you check out the facts, the overall situation seems to be more<br>
like Simon says it is, rather than as we are led to believe by over-<br>
enthusiastic, over-specialised environmentalists and the media (only bad<br>
news is good news, right?).  Perhaps he does exaggerate a bit, but maybe<br>
that's necessary: if he is to be believed, environmentalists have been<br>
exaggerating a lot, and getting away with it.<br>
<p>
I am beginning to think that a sizeable chunk of environmental<br>
propoganda is basically a kind of millenial disasterbation, arising out<br>
of peoples' lack of self-esteem.  Whipping ourselves is supposed to be<br>
cool. I don't think it's cool anymore: in fact I think there's something<br>
a bit nasty about it.<br>
