Greetings Reilly,<br>
<p>
You are extremely talented in decontextualization. Bravo.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...] nothing is *provable* in science, only</i><br>
<i>&gt; refutable. [More]</i><br>
<p>
If science cannot prove something as true or false, then science cannot<br>
attain truth. <br>
<p>
Once again, truth is not attainable by science. Even if you yourself are<br>
completely obsessed with attaining truth via science, you will not get<br>
it. Science predicts things, its a modern form of divination. It<br>
predicts and nothing else. It cannot do anything more than predict, and<br>
due to phenomena such as entropy and the butterfly effect we can never<br>
be certain that those predictions will always be 100% correct.  <br>
<p>
Your desire for truth is more of a religious fixation than any I have<br>
displayed. <br>
<p>
Science is fundamentally driven by need and desire. We need to be able<br>
to predict such and such to survive. I desire to predict such and such<br>
in order to survive forever. Science is a tool of need and desire. It is<br>
an emotive tool, yet it denies the emotions. Science is not a tool for<br>
attaining truth. And even if it were, the desire to attain truth, is a<br>
desire in-and-of-itself. I am interested in predicting that which is<br>
necessary in order to enable me to attain that which I need and desire.<br>
I have no desire to attain truth. We cannot even prove that absolute<br>
truth exists. It does not matter. It would not even matter if in some<br>
freakish sense that I myself did not "truely" exist. As long as I<br>
"believe" that I exist, that is all that matters. If this is all an<br>
illusion, who cares? Real or illusion, the truth does not matter. <br>
<p>
Today people say, "God is dead". Tomorrow people will realize that truth<br>
died with him.<br>
<p>
The concept of "truth" is not even compatible with Pancritical<br>
Rationalism. Truth is truth, its either true or false. Truth cannot<br>
sorta be truth ... thus the concept of truth is not open to criticism. <br>
<p>
I think the concept of truth is kept around in order to sustain<br>
epistemology. It perpetuates a priority for knowledge and cognition over<br>
intuition and emotion [the latter including need and desire].<br>
<p>
Without emotion science could not even exist. No one would feel the<br>
emotion of need or the emotion of desire in order to create science.<br>
Science can exist without truth though. It can exist in a subjective<br>
world without absolute absolutes just as long as things remain nearly<br>
the same long enough for us to treat them as objective and thus to<br>
enable us to predict things. We can functionally entertain the idea of<br>
absolute things without them truely being absolute. Suppose what we<br>
think of as constants are merely shifting in degree at an infintessimal<br>
level beyond our ability to measure. Its possible. But in the end it<br>
does not matter. <br>
<p>
I think Descartes proved once and for all with his evil genius theory<br>
that we can never attain truth, because we can never prove it. But we<br>
discard such circular theories in science because deep down we know its<br>
not important. Then we must ask ourselves, "For what reason do we cling<br>
to it?"    <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, chalk up yet one more twentieth-century vote in favor of lies and</i><br>
<i>&gt; propaganda.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, lets talk about honesty. I imagine that you believe yourself to be<br>
an upright honest individual. However, I have serious doubts that anyone<br>
is truely honest. Why? Because we are not even aware of all our<br>
underlying motivations. How much of what I say is determined by my<br>
genetics, by my subconscious, and by the particular chemical content of<br>
my CNS at any given moment? How can you be absolutely honest with others<br>
when you cannot even by honest with yourself. You do not know yourself<br>
well enough. You are not aware enough of whats going on subconsciously<br>
to imagine that you are being truthful. To a degree we attempt to be<br>
honest, but only to a degree. If we were truly interested in genuine<br>
interaction with others without underlying subconscious motivations<br>
affecting our thoughts and actions, then we would spend a great deal<br>
more time attempting to make conscious what is now subconscious. This<br>
requires a lot of attention given to the emotions. <br>
