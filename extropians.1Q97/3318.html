<p>
<p>
Objective reality is the least common denominator of shared, exogenous<br>
reality. It is for me, the least interesting facet of reality. It is<br>
important for many to "dedicate" their minds to it in order to further<br>
extroverted science, but it completely ignores and often denies<br>
subjective or endogenous realities. I find a much higher pleasure, and<br>
even ecstasy, in interacting with a select group of people who I have<br>
cultivated similar experiences with so that we can penetrate truly<br>
unexplored and hitherto unknown realms of subjective reality.<br>
<p>
It is because so many people have dedicated their minds to objective<br>
reality and because so few people haved dedicated their minds to<br>
subjective reality that we find ourselves rapidly expanding science and<br>
technology while as a whole we have not matured much at all in several<br>
thousand years. <br>
<p>
There is an overwhelming taboo in society to prefer endogenous space<br>
over exogenous space. So it has gone undeveloped, unaugmented. Whos to<br>
say that if we had not spent the last 500 years focusing on internal<br>
augmentation rather than or in combination with external augmentation<br>
that we would not have discovered by now how to do for ourselves what we<br>
now require external objects for? What if we had spent all this time<br>
developing mental tools for observing our own minds, like we have<br>
created so many tools to observe the exteranl world, e.g., microscopes,<br>
telescopes, etcettera? What if we had started emotive education 500<br>
years ago, and cultivated the skills for observing endogenous reality?<br>
Why do we not teach visualization skills in our schools? Why do we<br>
insist on being blind to what lies within? There is a whole frontier<br>
waiting for us that we have not begun to explore. Are you certain that<br>
if we had not focused on the external and had rather focused on the<br>
subtleties of the internal that we could not have discovered telepathy<br>
rather than radio? Are you certain of that? According to the Future<br>
Fantastic series, the CIA and many reputable scientists [in contrast to<br>
the CIA] are not so certain of that.<br>
<p>
What propelled external science was its tools for observation which made<br>
prediction possible, but we have never rigorously developed the mental<br>
tools for observing endogenous reality. Most people cannot even hold an<br>
image in their mind, not to mention keep it sharp and unmoving. Very few<br>
people have ever attempted any form of bio-feedback, and fewer yet have<br>
been successful at it. These things require more discipline than most<br>
people are willing to have. We REQUIRE government because we lack<br>
self-discipline, we are blind to and mostly ignorant of an entirely<br>
different paradigm of reality because we lack self-discipline.<br>
<p>
Our minds are unbelievable technological devices, yet we have put out<br>
relatively little effort to understand them firsthand, we'd rather probe<br>
at someone elses rather than enter our own. Its like trying to<br>
understand a computer by looking at a monitor while using a multi-meter<br>
to probe whats happening on the circuit board. We are completely<br>
ignoring the operating language. In this case our emotions. What is<br>
better, the psychiatrist that "cures" a persons depression by giving<br>
them a drug, or the psychologist who cures a persons depression by<br>
teaching them to think in a new way and thus to change their CNS<br>
chemical content directly themselves. The former person is dependent on<br>
the drug, where the latter needs no drug. The latter has a better<br>
understanding of the operating language where the former only<br>
understands the hardware.<br>
   <br>
<p>
Stripped of religious idealogy, I believe a subjective science could be<br>
created that would eventually surpass or at the least, seriously<br>
augment, objective science in its usefulness, but we are lazy.<br>
<p>
laziness, laziness, laziness, laziness.  <br>
<p>
Our minds are more powerful than computers are today. We have idiot<br>
savants to show us just how incredible our potential is. Yet we choose<br>
to create computers rather than to truly enhance our minds. <br>
  <br>
Lets say we developed skills of internal observation, visualiztion,<br>
emotive sensitivity, etcettera, and then we developed skills of<br>
bio-feedback, the ability to control autonomous bodily functions. We are<br>
matter, localized energy, whats to say that with sufficient<br>
intermiediary steps that we could not move on from bio-feedback to<br>
controlling our energy in new and profound ways. We are always<br>
discovering new and profound things via objective science. We would do<br>
the same if we took the other path. So just entertain me for a moment as<br>
I scenario-spin what must sound absolutely ridiculous to you, but if we<br>
did at some point learn how to directly manipulate the energy that makes<br>
us up, could we not then eventually overcome our needs for shelter,<br>
food, air, etcetera. Could we not travel great distances by merely<br>
changing the structure of our own energy, modifying ourselves so that we<br>
could propel ourselves at and sustain high speeds. <br>
<p>
I believe people cannot imagine such today in the same way that once<br>
people could not imagine a round world, or traveling to the moon. You<br>
might say that what I am talking about has been tried before, and it has<br>
failed, but it has not truly been tried before, not in the way objective<br>
science has. The tools for observation necessary for subjective science<br>
have never been adequately developed, and even when one person begins to<br>
develop them, it is difficult to find another person with the<br>
self-discipline necessary to do the same. Such has almost been entirely<br>
defered to religion, which has its own goals which hinder the kind of<br>
advancement I am speaking about. And even in religion, relatively few<br>
religions teach basic observation skills, that which is most<br>
fundamentally necessary to ever realizing an endogenous science. <br>
<p>
We are so incredibly unaware of ourselves, and instead of developing the<br>
enabling skills necessary to become directly aware of ourselves, we<br>
create a stethescope, a middleman to do the job for us. There are many<br>
people who are aware of their pulse and their breathing, people who can<br>
even modify their pulse by merely thinking about it, people who can<br>
modify their body tempature by merely thinking about it. But in general<br>
we are too lazy to do for ourselves what we can create an object to do.<br>
And thus we remain ignorant of our own workings and potential. Its much<br>
easier to take a couple aspirin to reduce a fever than to spend a couple<br>
weeks to a couple months learning how to reduce a fever via<br>
bio-feedback. Again its laziness. Anything our body does autonomously we<br>
can learn to become aware of and to modify ourselves. We could learn to<br>
boost our own immune systems and not even require medicine, but we are<br>
crude people. <br>
<p>
Fear and dislike of self: These two things compound our laziness in<br>
hindering the realization of an endogenous science. Most people are<br>
terrified of psychedelics. But its not the psychedelics that scare them,<br>
its the confrontation with their endogenous reality that scares them,<br>
the confrontation with self. People see demons and have repulsive<br>
thoughts and then are repulsed by themselves. But instead of accepting<br>
that it is a repulsion of self and a lack of discipline that causes<br>
their bad trip, they say its the drug. The drug is evil, the drug is<br>
bad. The drug caused their bad trip. Most people have no desire what so<br>
ever to enter endogenous reality. The thought of it is terrifying and<br>
potentially there really isn't anything more terrifying. The<br>
subconscious is where these people have spent their life repressing all<br>
their trashy thoughts. Once they see whats there, they are so<br>
overwhelmed they never want to return. Its much safer in the objective<br>
world. There are lots of people[automotons] to comfort them, and<br>
thousands of tasks to keep their minds preoccupied so that they can live<br>
a productive life without ever truly getting to know themselves.<br>
<p>
Eventually I imagine the human species will branch off into new and<br>
separate species following different evolutionary courses. I don't find<br>
it likely that we will continue evolving along the same path forever.<br>
Looking at evoltion as a whole, it actually seems very unlikely that we<br>
will not branch off. One thing that may affect this branching, perhaps a<br>
hundred years from now or two thousand years from now or more, will be a<br>
choice between endogenous and exogenous reality, internal augmentation<br>
versus external augmentation. <br>
<p>
So in conclusion, no, I do not plan to dedicate my mind to the task of<br>
discovering what everyone shares, e.g. objective reality. That is the<br>
path we take by default. There are plenty of people on it. We seem to be<br>
genetically predisposed to make that decision. My mind is dedicated to<br>
endogenous reality. Dead end? Perhaps, but science of any sort is about<br>
taking chances. My sudden interest in Extropy has been in its interest<br>
for attaining immortality. Though perhaps I might be delusioned, I'm not<br>
dumb, objective science has a big head start on attaining immortality,<br>
and if it makes such possible I will be the first to jump on that wagon,<br>
buts once [if] I become immortal, I have forever to develop endogenous<br>
science, endogenous realities, and thus a degree of autonomy that could<br>
never be obtained via objective science which requires so many levels of<br>
symbiosis, dependency, and conformity with the other. Nature is pretty<br>
damn cool, but if I had several billion years, I think I could create<br>
something a hell of a lot cooler.  <br>
<p>
It is very easy to deny what you have never made a sustained and<br>
disciplined effort to experience and more importantly to develop. The<br>
scientists who speak most adamantly against endogenous science are those<br>
who are most ignorant of endogenous reality.  <br>
<p>
Objective science is a tool for observation. And every tool has its<br>
limitations. I am suggesting the development of another tool, subjective<br>
or more accurately, endogenous science [because its not absolutely<br>
subjective, just as objective science is not absolutely objective] to<br>
augment and perhaps one day [for some] to replace the former. This has<br>
nothing to do with superstitions, mysticism, blind faith, or<br>
irrationality. It is actually a response to the superstions, selective<br>
blindness, and irrationality of objective science. Endogenous science is<br>
about circumventing external tools of augmentation, and particularly<br>
external tools of observation which are not necessary. Its benefits are<br>
all the same that emotive education offers plus the realization of a<br>
level of autonomy that could never be achieved via external<br>
augmentation. The greater our autonomy, the less we need and are<br>
influenced by the other [nature, people, government, devices, drugs,<br>
etcetera], and thus the greater are our chances as immortals, to truly<br>
live forever. Endogenous science is fantasy now in no less the same<br>
sense that objective science is what science fiction was.<br>
<p>
And with all that said, I still consider myself Extropian. Of the five<br>
principles it is only the fourth that I must clarify for myself. For I<br>
am all for intelligent technology, but if its possible for me to develop<br>
my brain to do something as quickly and effectively or more so than<br>
external technology can, then I will opt for the former. It would be<br>
ludicrous for an idiot savant who has the ability to rapidly count or do<br>
arithmatic to use a calculator, he/she can do so faster than he/she<br>
could even turn the calculator on. I will not use technology as an<br>
excuse not to take responsibility for my own self-development. Again<br>
what is better, the psychiatrist that "cures" a persons depression by<br>
giving them a drug, or the psychologist who cures a persons depression<br>
by teaching them to think in a new way and thus to change their CNS<br>
chemical content directly themselves. I believe the latter active person<br>
has several distinct advantages over the former passive patient. Deny<br>
them if you will. I guess its easier to just give someone a drug. We<br>
should probably stick to whats easiest. A dear friend of mine went to a<br>
psychiatrist for the first time, she had not been there more than 20<br>
minutes before the psychiatrist prescribed prozac to her. Its nice that<br>
we have such simple solutions today.<br>
<p>
<p>
Its easier to be disciplined by the government than to discipline<br>
oneself. Its easier to be disciplined by a drug than to discipline<br>
oneself. Its easier to be a passive recipiant rather than an active<br>
participant. Its my understanding that Extropians are advocates of<br>
self-governing, self-responsibility, and dynamic participation ... then<br>
why would we choose external technology solely over internal technology.<br>
Why would we choose dependency on external objects when we can<br>
potentially do the same for ourselves via a better understanding and<br>
more disciplined control over what we already have? Humans are a<br>
wasteful lot. I have simply chosen to attempt a degree a balance.  <br>
<p>
<p>
"And how could there exist a 'common good'! The expression is a<br>
self-contradiction: what can be common has ever but little value. In the<br>
end it must be as it is and has always been: great things are for the<br>
great, abysses for the profound, shudders and delicasies for the<br>
refined, and, in sum, all rare things for the rare." [Nietzsche]<br>
