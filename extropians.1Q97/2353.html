But who can afford to spend all their time working for free? Many people<br>
have told me that my Lancia cars Web site is much better than the official<br>
company site, but it's unlikely to expand much further unless either<br>
someone pays me or other people start writing and submitting pages of<br>
their own. <br>
<p>
More likely, as the use of digital cash and low-overhead net payment<br>
systems increases these previously free sites will begin to charge for<br>
access in order to support themselves. <br>
