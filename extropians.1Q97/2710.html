A couple of possibilities come to mind. People may feel more qualified to<br>
give opinions on politics than they do on say, physics, because politics<br>
(of some form) is inextricably linked with the social structures to which<br>
they belong. That is, they perceive politics having much more of a direct<br>
impact on their lives than physics theories or formulae do, and hence feel<br>
they are in a better position to comment on political issues.<br>
<p>
Whether they really are in such a better position is, of course, another<br>
matter.<br>
<p>
Another explanation might be that people figure that social/political<br>
studies aren't really "science", in that the researchers are often<br>
prevented by ethics (and law) from setting up the tightly-controlled<br>
experimental conditions available to some other sciences.<br>
