Eric Watt Forste wrote 2/14/97: &lt;I don't see any French guys on that list,<br>
Reilly. I could name a whole bunch more sources, too.&gt;<br>
<p>
Please name them, the more the merrier!<br>
<p>
&lt;But we need to keep in mind that all such attempts to trace intellectual<br>
currents in history and pin responsibility on them are examples of<br>
collectivist thinking, and that collectivist thinking is often misleading.&gt;<br>
<p>
You lost me here.  Historians chronicling the progression of ideas from<br>
individual to individual are all guilty of "collectivist thinking"? <br>
Perhaps you're confusing this work with "historicism," the attempt to sneak<br>
determinism back into liberty-loving Western polities to subvert them. <br>
Attempts to merely trace intellectual currents and pin responsibility on<br>
them for their consequences, good or bad, has nothing whatsoever to do with<br>
"collectivist thinking."  It has to do with aiming at truth, and<br>
highlighting cause-and-effect; answering the important question of what<br>
ideas have worked and what ideas have not worked.  It is an individual<br>
vocation undertaken seriously and responsibly.  History done by committee<br>
or by "collectivist thinking" is more typified by the monocultural<br>
group-think compost-modernists, aka 'revisionist' history.<br>
<p>
&lt;If you are a lover of liberty, you believe in free speech, and it seems<br>
strange to me for a believer in free speech to blame the wielder of the pen<br>
and not the wielder of the sword.&gt;<br>
<p>
It seems strange to me that you do not see that the wielders of the sword<br>
are egged on and rationalized by the wielders of the pen.  If the pen is<br>
mightier than the sword, shouldn't we aim at the pens (the ideas, of<br>
course) that set up the moral and intellectual atmosphere for harmful<br>
consequences to liberty-loving polities anywhere in order to counter them? <br>
Your position seems ostrich-like.<br>
<p>
&lt;And finally, it's my opinion that the current crop of French<br>
poststructuralists are neither very original nor very interesting.&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree, radical skepticism is boringly repetitive historically, always<br>
with the same harmful results fostered by the moral corrosion spread by it<br>
in societies.  Yet here we are again, not learning from history.<br>
<p>
&lt;...you've moved on to abusing the French.&gt;<br>
<p>
Next you'll be calling me "mean-spirited."  I've been wary of the French<br>
for a very long, long time.  But what really clinched it for me, was the<br>
immortal words of the great philosopher Al Bundy, on a TV episode of<br>
"Married... With Children" where Professor Bundy climbed down a mountain<br>
with the modern version of the Ten Commandments etched on the back of a<br>
guitar; he intoned the modern Second Commandment:  "It is wrong to be<br>
French."  That did it for me, a total self-epiphany, the grok of ages,<br>
absolute truth emanating from the boob tube, the most unlikely place I'd<br>
have expected to find it.<br>
