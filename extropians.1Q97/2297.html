Extropians,  I found the advise given to Mike Cowar on how to deal with<br>
his God-fearing Christian parents by various Extropians to the effect:<br>
submit to their will, pretend to be the faithful God-fearing son,  seek<br>
appeasment, just make believe that you still subscribe to their belief<br>
system,  very interesting.  I just wonder how people continue to pretend<br>
to believe in various mandatory belief systems, such as God, JC, an<br>
immortal, metaphysical soul etc. to avoid censor or ostracism from<br>
family members or in the case of  politician their constituency.  Is<br>
there any American politician that publically avows to being an atheist?<br>
 Do we just go on pretending to be what everyone else expects us to be<br>
during our lives, having dual belief systems, one for show and the other<br>
privately held?  Is this not the case with some Extropians in regard to<br>
environmental beliefs?  As soon as they read someone like Julian Simon,<br>
their socially acceptable environmental beliefs change course.  Just<br>
another probing question from Cyber Ed.<br>
