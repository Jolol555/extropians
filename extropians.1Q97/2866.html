Since we are not going to put an adult brain into a newborn's<br>
body, we would need another adult body.  An adult body is a<br>
result of genetic code and years of growth and training in the<br>
environment that has no purely genetic alternative. So we either<br>
need a dramatically better (than cloning) technology to grow a<br>
20-year-old body in a vat, or we get the clone to develop and<br>
walk around as a human being, and then use this person for spare<br>
parts.  The clone might not agree with it.  On the other hand,<br>
some people may prefer to spend 20 or 25 years doing nothing<br>
but playing sports and breathing fresh air to grow a perfect body,<br>
to 80 years of education and work.  Hmm...  The happy clones may<br>
identify themselves with the body a lot more than with the brain<br>
(they don't have to be taught they have a brain!) so they may<br>
not care if the brain is replaced...<br>
