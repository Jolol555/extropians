In my personal ethical system, I regard complex, diverse systems as a<br>
fundamental good (this is a completely arbitrary basis, but it works quite<br>
well). This of course implies that a biosphere is something *very*<br>
valuable, and that keeping it viable and diverse is an ethical act. It<br>
also implies that ideally, I should not interfere in it to decrease its<br>
(long run) diversity, and that to achieve this I should also try to<br>
convince others about the same thing (see the meme? :-). <br>
<p>
Not all extropians or other transhumanists share this ethics (in fact, we<br>
seem to have a free market for ethics :-), but I think most agree more or<br>
less with the basic premise that *extropic* systems are valuable. So in <br>
the long run we are very radical environmentalists, since we want to <br>
extend the biosphere to encompass the entire universe, not just a single <br>
planet.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, how protection and extension of the biosphere should <br>
be implemented in practice, that is another matter; there are several <br>
approaches ranging from fiat by nanotechnological superiority to free <br>
markets, and the debate between them tends to run hot.<br>
<p>
BTW, the widespread belief that we are nearing an ecological catastrophy<br>
might in some sense be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many people seem to<br>
become passivated by this idea, thinking that it is inevitable and hence<br>
not doing anything practical about it. And the people who become activated<br>
by it unfortunately tends to demand harsh solutions with little regard for<br>
other opinions (after all, they are saving the world). Just goes to show<br>
that we need to develop the human mind a bit further... <br>
