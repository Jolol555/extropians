In my opinion, this is not (just) an ethical question, it's the logic of<br>
believing in a laissez-faire system, where human social actions are<br>
believed to be detrimental to 'a natural order'. My point was that giving<br>
money to ones children, conflicts just as much with such a 'natural order' <br>

I didn't intend anything so drastically, again i just want to point out the<br>
fact that a system without 'guidance' works when relatively more money is<br>
in the hands of those that are relaitvely more intelligent, who will make<br>
better decisions as to what to consume. (in view of the consumer elite<br>
discussed a few weeks ago on this list) And point out the problem that will<br>
arise after X generations of rich people who didn't come in to that money<br>
themselves. What decisions will they make in what products to buy ?, and<br>
how will THEIR decisions influence the rest of humanity ? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You want socialized medicine and you call yourself an extropian? The FAQ</i><br>
<i>&gt;says something about that.</i><br>
<p>
On the brighter side, a large part of the stupid people would simply lose<br>
all the money they had been given in no time anyway. Question is what<br>
damage can they do to the system, in the time they take to lose that money ?<br>
<p>
It all depends on how much the little social mobility such a system has,<br>
will make up for this. I'm sure you're aware that the last few generations<br>
aren't always 'doing a little better' anymore... <br>
