I have a number of sources for my data, by the vast majority of my equations<br>
and calculational information came from the book "Design of Structures to<br>
Resist Nuclear Weapons Effects" from the American Society of Civil Engineers<br>
(ASCE) Manuals and Reports on Engineering Practice No. 42 (ISBN:0-87262-439-0).<br>
It is essentually 300+ pages of everything you ever wanted to know about<br>
structural engineering in nuclear environments.  It forced me to dust off my<br>
engineering skills, since I don't use them professionally.  There is a<br>
hundreds of empirical and heuristical equations and data covering every<br>
possible aspect of this subject.  I got some of my data from books, and some<br>
from the 'net.  I also was able to glean some technical information from<br>
DoE.  The meteor impact information was retrieved from various sites from<br>
the net, mostly NASA and .edu sites.<br>
<p>
Calculations for the lunar environment are actually much simpler because<br>
there are far fewer factors involved.  The difficulty was that all the<br>
equations assume an earthbound environment.  Removing the extraneous factors<br>
was subject to quite a bit of error.  This is why I finally used underground<br>
nuclear testing as a baseline for my calculations.  After you get a decent<br>
set of baseline data, all that is left is a lot of number crunching, and<br>
nothing terribly difficult.<br>
<p>
If you want to know all the equations involved, I recommend the above<br>
mentioned book.  It is very thorough, technically complete, and designed as<br>
an engineering handbook.<br>

I've remained mostly non-partisan in this discussion (because I don't really<br>
care; it is just an interesting bit of calculation), but my personal opinion<br>
is that UNLESS the moon was extremely well developed and populated, it would<br>
not be able to adequately defend itself against a determined assault from<br>
earth.  In the case of a minimally developed moon, it would be too easy to<br>
permanently damage an already precarious economy and environment.  The lunar<br>
environment would be more or less permanently dependant on earth for things<br>
such as organic materials.<br>
<p>
If the moon was fully developed however (like a small planet), then I see no<br>
reason why it could not be adequately defended.  It is mostly a matter of<br>
distributing your economy and not having all your eggs in one basket.<br>
<p>
SIDE NOTE (TRIVIA YOU BOTH MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN):<br>
<p>
You wouldn't necessarily have to put really large rocks into orbit.  Some<br>
are already orbiting the earth.  According to astronomers, there are<br>
something like 13 non-trivial natural bodies orbiting earth.  Discounting<br>
the moon (which is one of them)  I believe the sizes range from about<br>
50-2000 meters in diameter.  Simply the threat of dropping a big one (say,<br>
1000 meters) into an ocean should be sufficient deterrent from attack.  An<br>
ocean drop doesn't have to be accurate, and would destroy *a lot* of coastal<br>
cities and lands.<br>
