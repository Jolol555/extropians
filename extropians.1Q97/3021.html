Creativity is often looked upon as a mysterious magical quality of artists.<br>
Yet, the word creativity covers a wide range of skills. For example, Do Bono<br>
writes:<br>
<p>
"A few people, a very few people, now know that there is an absolute<br>
mathematical necessity for human creativity because of the way human<br>
perception works as a self-organiziang information system.  Such systems<br>
demand creativity and also provocation."<br>
<p>
and, more:<br>
<p>
"... These systems are patterning systems.  They make and use patterns.<br>
<i>&gt;From an analysis of the behavior and potential behavior in such system we</i><br>
can get a very clear idea of the nature of creativity.  All at once the<br>
mystique of creativity falls away. We can see how creativity works. We can<br>
also see how we might devise techniques to increase the possibility of new<br>
ideas. In a sense we come to look at the "logic" of creativity. ... No leap<br>
of faith or mystical acceptance is required. There is no mysterious black<br>
box labeled, 'in here it all happens.'"<br>
<p>
Learning how to be creative require an ability to train thought patterns to<br>
take new routes. Conjecture helps us to seek new paths. Just as conceptual<br>
art produced great thought, but little end product; imagining is a great<br>
training field for ideas, as long as we don't get caught up in the very<br>
hypothesizing.<br>
<p>
Taking it a step further, we can add to the concept of "serious" creativity<br>
and give it more spin. Perhaps the earnest use of creativity could be a<br>
panacea for our extropic achievements. Just point to your head and say, "In<br>
here it all happens!"<br>
