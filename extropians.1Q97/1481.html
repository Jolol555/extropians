This is very true, however, the definition of "you" has changed in the<br>
process (or at least is radically different from its normal definition).  <br>
None of which changes, what IMO, is the fact that this subject will<br>
inevitably lead to an infinite regress when pursued.<br>
<p>
Not that I'm saying it's not worth pursuing, as pursuit of the unknown<br>
is one of the more interesting things that we can do with life if we <br>
actually succeed in making progress at it.<br>
