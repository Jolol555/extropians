<i>&gt; } good reasons, especially the writing system.  It is far more efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; } than alphabetic systems: more words per page, fewer penstrokes per word,</i><br>
<i>&gt; } faster to read and comprehend.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bloody hell to learn, though.  Thing is, language for humans (and most</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumans; I think you have to make rather drastic changes to avoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; this) is foremost spoken communication.  Or gestural, for the deaf; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; relative ease of deaf children learning sign language vs. normal people</i><br>
<i>&gt; and spoken language is something I should read up on, I suppose.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Writing comes second.  It therefore makes it easier to learn the writing</i><br>
<i>&gt; system if it corresponds well to the spoken language...</i><br>
<p>
I agree that ideographs take longer to learn than alphabets.  I<br>
thought, therefore, it might make more sense to base the ideographic<br>
writing system on the gestural language.  That way, the deaf would<br>
not have the tremendous handicap of learning a writing system that<br>
to them is complete nonsense (of course, they're stuck with the<br>
alphabet for things like foreign names), and even hearing students<br>
have a built-in memory aid for the ideographs.<br>
<p>
I think it's criminal that children today are not /all/ taught<br>
sign language from birth.  It has many marvellous uses even to the<br>
hearing (such as talking to someone across a noisy room or quiet<br>
restaurant), and the lack of universality makes the deaf people's<br>
handicap even worse.<br>
