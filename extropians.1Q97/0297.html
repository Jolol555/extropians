Max More forwarded an article on neural net technology:<br>
&lt;Dr. Sutherland, president of AND Corp., has created a new type of <br>
computing that he calls holographic neural technology, and some of the <br>
people using the new technology say its implications are staggering, <br>
perhaps even frightening.&gt;<br>

&lt;AND Corporation of Hamilton, Ontario has developed a novel approach <br>
to neural modeling very different from conventional techniques. <br>
Instead of training a network by feeding one set of I/O data at a <br>
time, all data is analysed together to produce an I/O map that <br>
directly links input and output data. The method is not a <br>
connectionist model. Instead, complex number arithmetic is used to <br>
perform regression analysis. The phase angle represents the actual <br>
value of the item, while the amplitude of the vector represents its <br>
Degree of Belief.26<br>
<p>
Holographic systems27 require only single cells to learn <br>
stimulus-response associations. These systems can actually learn in <br>
real time unlike connectionist models which require considerable time <br>
to learn an I/O map. Holographic nets map all input/output data on one <br>
pass directly into the structure of the neuron "cell". Speed of <br>
learning is orders-of-magnitude greater than existing back-propagation <br>
techniques.<br>
<p>
Holography is not simply retrieval of patterns. All I/O patterns are <br>
actually superimposed onto the same set of synapses. The model has the <br>
advantage of conventional network accuracy but at only a fraction of <br>
the memory and processing time to perform a similar pattern-ID task. <br>
HNet generalizes by performing interpolation among the trained I/O <br>
mappings much as occurs in a Fuzzy Logic controller. Similar to the <br>
numerous Defuzzification and Inferencing options available, <br>
holographic networks allow a User to modify the generalization <br>
characteristics so that mappings overlap as interpolation is <br>
performed.26 &gt;<br>
