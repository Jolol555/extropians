All sane humans identify with both.  The head provides the thinking to get<br>
what the heart wants.<br>

<p>
But justification must follow from premises, which cannot be derived<br>
logically.  In humans the premises come from the heart.  You're just saying<br>
you analyze your premises more carefully than most people, who run about with<br>
self-contradictory premises because they let their "heart decide" (i.e., just<br>
accept what premise it coughs up that day).  This is very sensible, but it<br>
doesn't mean that your base goals are derived logically, only that you apply<br>
logic aggressively and constently to achieve your goals.<br>
