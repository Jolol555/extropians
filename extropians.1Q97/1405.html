I think that those expecting (or hoping for) another diatribe will be <br>
disappointed, but read on:<br>
<p>
Eliezer Yudkowsky:<br>
<i>&gt;I continue to try and find a cure for being a teenager.  I find</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolutionary psychology to be the key and necessary tool in that area. </i><br>
<p>
Fine.  No one here is saying that you shouldn't pursue that.  But <br>
please believe me when I say that your own understanding of gender <br>
and its place in human relations will advance drastically over the <br>
next few years, and your university years will yield further more <br>
exponential growth.  Even at my age and many intense years of pushing <br>
the limits of gender expression, I still believe that I have much to <br>
learn and many avenues of growth ahead.  This is why I will not <br>
accept static viewpoints.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is a highly controversial area.  </i><br>
<p>
This is an area ripe for human exploration, advancement and achievement, <br>
and to let those with limited horizons place their limitations on us <br>
would not be in keeping with principles of transhumanism.  And since when <br>
have transhumanists allowed controversy to bar them from their quest?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Even if you are a researcher [credentials?] and I am not, I don't think your particular and</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientifically disputed viewpoint should reign unchallenged simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;because you happen to be the only credentialed researcher on the list. </i><br>
<p>
I've never made any such claim, either to you or to the many individuals <br>
on this list have contacted me off-list for extended conversations on <br>
key points.  When it is clear that an individual has put thought and <br>
study and enthusiasm into an idea, a question, a challenge, I welcome <br>
and value such interaction.  It is exciting and inspiring to me to <br>
learn all the different ways in which people are experimenting with <br>
new modes of interacting with each other and with their own bodies.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you seriously stating that evolutionary psychology is now viewed as</i><br>
<i>&gt;a baseless and failed experiment by the majority of gender-difference</i><br>
<i>&gt;researchers?  </i><br>
<p>
Again, I have made no such claim, as should be evidenced by my own <br>
contributions to the evolutionary thread.  I myself utilize <br>
evolutionary research in my own development and enjoy hearing about <br>
new discoveries and theories.  My best friend spends her time digging <br>
for clues to our past in the dirt, and I have recently come to <br>
realize that we are engaged in the same search--only she looks to the <br>
past and I to the future.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In any case, if you're going to try and pull rank,</i><br>
<p>
What rank?  I merely made it clear to you that I also possess the <br>
'genius' credentials you claim to possess, and that I have changed <br>
modes into challenging you to live up to that.  And also to draw the <br>
line between criticizing on the sidelines and participating in some <br>
way.  <br>
<p>
I made the decision not to pursue a more advanced degree in gender <br>
studies, because a degree in another field will be more useful for me, <br>
but I do continue to incorporate it as a key element.  Some of the <br>
most amazing writing on gender has come from individuals who approach <br>
it from an interdisciplinary perspective.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, Fourth Edition: Copyright 1985.</i><br>
<p>
This is a seriously outdated source, partly because of some <br>
methodological issues and partly because many fields have made some <br>
serious progress in the past ten years as to how they will approach the <br>
topic of gender.  I am sure that the most recent edition of that <br>
textbook will incorporate many of these changes.  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
