Fair point.  But again, conditions can change.  They might be secretly<br>

I wasn't assuming any radiation.  I was just thinking of big explosions<br>
and dust thrown up.  But you're right; unless they used lots of really<br>
big rocks there wouldn't be total wipeout.  They could still worry about<br>

Poor because of heat and radiation; rich in energy and possibly metals.<br>

Lower in energy; useful or quick terraforming is hardly guaranteed, Kim<br>
Robinson notwithstanding.  Earth has a fair chance of remaining the<br>
intellectual capital.<br>
<p>
Robin claims we're debating a vague question, since there's no<br>
specification of lunar colony size or exact political conditions.  I<br>
thought we were swimming through multiple possibilities at once, but<br>
perhaps not very well.<br>

<p>
I'm arguing with someone who claims he can convert angular and linear<br>
momentum and who has just proposed stellating the large Jovians, on a<br>
list with regular discussions of Tipler cylinders, infinite Omega Points<br>
and a Singularity in 38 years, or 28 years, or maybe before the<br>
millenium.  And I've just been told that colonizing Venus is impossible.<br>
Catch this, Anders?  Extro-conservative high point...<br>
<p>
Why?  High atmospheric pressure yes, but I hadn't heard it defied known<br>
forces, or even materials -- Russian probes lasted there, just not for<br>
very long.  It's very hot, but that's what air conditioning was made<br>
for.  Admittedly the problem is more interesting, in that you might have<br>
to cool the very surface of the material, or else (more likely?) have<br>
some way to continually renew it, but at the moment these seem like<br>
highly interesting engineering problems.  (I'm also not sure about<br>
dumping the heat from the fusion or black hole reactor; can air<br>
conditioning go that far?  If not, perhaps deep drill for geothermal.)<br>
And I presume much would be underground as usual, or under whatever the<br>
surface is like.<br>
<p>
Difficult as hell, yes, quite literally.  Impossible?  <br>
