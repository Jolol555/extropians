The FCC has powers.  With these, it sometimes seizes our rights.<br>
<p>
That the FCC has laid claim to the electromagnetic spectrum should give rise<br>
to more outrage than the claims that the US made to the West in the 1800s.<br>
 What has the FCC done to "improve" the airwaves?  Control over spectrum,<br>
like ownership over land in the state of nature, should vest the person to<br>
first put it into productive use.  (For the theoretically minded, the cause<br>
of action would arise not as a property right but as a claim for tortious<br>
interference with business relations or the like, as nuisance, or as<br>
contract.)  Planting a flag in one corner of a continent does not suffice;<br>
nor should statists' claims about the "public" airwaves.<br>

<p>
By a very defensible definition of "fair", no.  But note at any rate that the<br>
FCC gives only sharply delimited rights.  It exercises considerable<br>
regulation over use of the spectrum that it "sells".  Were the FCC to sell<br>
off the rights en toto and then get out of the way, a Coasian would applaud.<br>
<p>
Such a one-time sale of complete title to electromagnetic spectrum represents<br>
a morally imperfect solution, but an excellent exit strategy.  The statists<br>
get their big pay-off, the telecoms get free reign, and the FCC turns to<br>
other matters.  This exit stategy would, ideally, leave room for spectrum<br>
analogs to such real property notions as easements and averse possession.<br>
 "Regulation" would follow via common law suits.<br>
