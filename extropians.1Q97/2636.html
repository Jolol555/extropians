From: Phil Goetz &lt;goetz@cs.Buffalo.EDU&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; If everyone suddenly had 8 additional leisure hours per day, this would</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily reduce the marginal value of leisure time.  It would also</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase the marginal value of work, since people would have more time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; spend money.  Necessarily, statistically speaking, people would work</i><br>
<i>&gt; more hours.  Lower wages follows from the increase in the worker-hour pool,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and because the minimum amount of money needed to support yourself and your</i><br>
<i>&gt; family for a week, which is the minimum amount that the large unskilled labor</i><br>
<i>&gt; pool will accept for a week's work, does not change (or even goes down,</i><br>
<i>&gt; due to not needing a house), while the number of hours they can work doubles.</i><br>
<p>
Robin Hanson, in his Extropy article about uploads, has a brief footnote<br>
that discusses some theory about how much people will work.  Here is<br>
what he says, from<br>
&lt;URL: <a href="http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/uploads.html#footnote3">http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/uploads.html#footnote3</a> &gt;:<br>
<p>
   Consider a model where utility is roughly a product of powers of leisure<br>
   and consumption, and amount produced is roughly a product of powers of<br>
   labor and other capital. Such a model can explain why leisure time has<br>
   not changed much as per capita wealth has increased dramatically over<br>
   the last few centuries, can explain high leisure among slave owners,<br>
   and explains why leisure is higher in places and times with high income<br>
   taxes. One can explain seasonal high leisure among foraging tribes as<br>
   due to seasonal limits on foraging productivity.<br>
<p>
This is pretty compact, but the general idea is that if you can<br>
significantly increase your income by working more hours, then you will<br>
have an incentive to do so.  If you suddenly gave everyone 8 more hours<br>
a day, a first order estimate is that it would be divided up roughly as<br>
the rest of the day is, about 50-50.  To get a more precise estimate you<br>
have to look at how each individual would value an hour of additional<br>
leisure vs an hour of additional income.<br>
<p>
The suggestion that wages would fall ignores one fact.  If people are<br>
working more hours, more goods are being produced.  Wages are ultimately a<br>
matter of productivity.  Unless productivity falls, wages should not fall.<br>
I see no particular reason why the additional profits should flow to<br>
the capitalist.<br>
<p>
There will also be increased demand for many consumer goods since people<br>
are awake and alert all day, so they will increase their consumption of<br>
most things.  This should lead to a general increase in economic activity<br>
in virtually all sectors.<br>
<p>
Now at first it is possible that productivity would fall somewhat<br>
during the transitional period.  There could be insufficient capital<br>
equipment to match the increased labor pool.  But this should be quickly<br>
remedied.  And don't forget that the same factors which cause increases<br>
in productivity today would increase as well.  There will be more hours<br>
for inventors, scientists, and other creative people to come up with new<br>
and better methods of production.  So actually we would expect the rate<br>
of productivity improvements to increase since there are more hours per<br>
year for people to work on this.<br>
<p>
Ultimately therefore I would expect wages to be higher, for people<br>
to have both more money and more leisure, and for there to be more<br>
goods produced.  Unless you count the loss of sleep as a negative in and<br>
of itself, it looks to me like it would be a great boon to free ourselves<br>
from the need to sleep.<br>
