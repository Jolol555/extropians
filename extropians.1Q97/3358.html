Sorry, I didn't know people could own a mode of thought. Should I be paying<br>
royalties to Karl Marx now? Furthermore, I'm aware of who responded to my<br>
message. I'm not going to keep my mouth shut for fear of offending<br>
"important" people any more than "unimportant" folk.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I like being rude, it makes people pay attention. </i><br>

<i>&gt;You may enjoy rudeness for the shock value, but it won't carry you </i><br>

First off, that was sarcasm. Secondly, I did not expect anger. I did not<br>
reply with anger, in fact I replied with great sadness. I take it very<br>
personally when scientists are made to look foolish.<br>
