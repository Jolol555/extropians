"Posthuman unbounded: artificial evolution and high-tech subcultures"<br>
by Tiziana Terranova, in _FutureNatural_ (Routledge, London &amp; NY NY, 1996,<br>
ISBN 0-415-07014-7) talks about Extropians.<br>
<p>
Terranova dwells earnestly on the contradictions in the transhumanist<br>
position which she is going to point out, and at the end she angsts over<br>
the contradictions she has pointed out, but in between I didn't find any<br>
contradictions except to say that some transhumanists (Decoder) are<br>
leftists, and some (us) are libertarians, and some (cyberpunks) are<br>
pessimists, while some (us) are optimists.<br>
<p>
She pretends objectivity, but shows her scorn for her subjects by<br>
lovingly preserving every single typo captured from her sources and<br>
highlighting them with a [sic].<br>
<p>
She infers that transhumanism is male, with all the baggage that goes along<br>
with that if you are feminist (male, linear, non-contextual, aggressive,<br>
logical, non-holistic), because of an offhanded remark made by R.U.<br>
Sirius in Mondo 2000, calling this whole talk-show-as-new-electronic-forum<br>
thing as scary, "given the preponderance of bored housewives with nothing<br>
better to do than get all twitchy over different people's sexual difference."<br>
The lesson here is, and I am quite serious and not tongue-in-cheek,<br>
if you are going to belittle any "generic person" in the pages of _Extropy_<br>
or on this mailing list, make sure you belittle a generic man and not a<br>
generic woman.  No one will mind, no one will insinuate or infer, if you<br>
say something bad about an arbitrary man.<br>
<p>
When she delves into the impact of the Internet etc. on society at large,<br>
her language sinks into murky liberal jargon.<br>
What she seems to be saying is that the Extropians don't care<br>
that many people can't take advantage of these new technologies, not<br>
because they're stupid or lazy, but because their culture socializes<br>
them against it.  Any program to alter the foundations of our society<br>
should include a program for including these people.<br>
<p>
Actually I don't recommend the book _FutureNatural_.  This criticism<br>
shouldn't be taken very seriously, since I have only glanced through the<br>
book, and one of the articles ("An Interview with Satan", by Frank Dexter)<br>
was quite interesting.  But it seems to be mostly a collection of<br>
philosophers, postmodernists, and feminists talking about technology.<br>
If I were to edit a book about the impact of technology on society, I would<br>
have tried to have a higher representation of people who knew what they<br>
were talking about versus people who knew what other people had said.<br>
