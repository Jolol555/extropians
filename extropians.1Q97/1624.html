Tongue in cheek?  It's perfectly accurate, the accuracy only possessable<br>
by subjunctive syllogisms.  If brains are on one bell curve, and looks<br>
on another independent curve, then being on the far right end of both<br>
(or either end of both) is unlikely, in much the same way that it is<br>
more unlikely to win the lottery two days in a row than only once in<br>
those two days.  Most good looking people will be of average<br>
intelligence; most smart people will be of average looks.  Most people<br>
will be average in both.  (Bell curve implying smoothness and near<br>
continuity.)<br>
<p>
If intellectual accomplishment for most people is more influenceable by<br>
training and effort than by genes, then it perhaps need not lie on a<br>
bell curve.  Or there could be a dependency -- beautiful people might not put<br>
any effort into being smart, living off of their brains; conversely they<br>
might have more self-confidence, and thus do better in other areas in<br>
life.  Which of these two paragraphs reality lies closer to is open to<br>
debate.<br>
