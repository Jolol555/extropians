<i>&gt; Suppose I want to make $10,000,  </i><br>
<i>&gt; there are two ways to go about it. I can work to repeal hundreds of special </i><br>
<i>&gt; interest laws, each one costing me a few dollars, or I can lobby for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; passage of one more special interest law that will give me and my friends</i><br>
<i>&gt; $10,000 and cost everybody else a dollar or two.</i><br>
<p>
This is a problem with our government:  Laws are bought, but the costs<br>
of entry into corruption are high.  It takes a lot of money and expertise<br>
to bribe a congressman, and I can't even begin.  It's cost-effective for<br>
corporations to spend $100K to get a bill passed that will net them $1M.<br>
<p>
I've thought that it might be more fair if laws were bought and sold openly,<br>
rather than secretly as they are now.  Imagine if, instead of Congress<br>
voting on a bill, voters pledged money for or against it.  People would<br>
have to put their money where their mouth is.  People would straighten out<br>
their priorities pretty quick if they had to back them up with cash.<br>
For example, I think you'd see that, though people are eager to restrict<br>
other people's freedom when it doesn't match their code of ethics,<br>
they'd be a lot more tolerant if they had to shell out dough to ban<br>
homosexuality, etc.<br>
<p>
For another thing, if Wal-Grain Inc. wanted to pass a big farm subsidy bill<br>
that would cost everyone in Iowa a dollar in taxes, a million people<br>
sending in a dime each could stop it.  Postage could be a barrier at this<br>
level, but there are ways around that.  Under the present system, the<br>
farm subsidy bill could not be opposed financially unless there were<br>
already a watchdog special-interest group just waiting to oppose farm<br>
subsidy bills if they arose.  Which would hardly be worth the cost of<br>
setting up the organization.<br>
