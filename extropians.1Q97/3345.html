<i>&gt;Gen X is not the only generation around, is politically weak for its</i><br>
<i>&gt;size,</i><br>
<p>
Does size really matter that much? It's not the size that counts, it's how<br>
you use it. Seriously. Fuck the voting system. We all know voting means<br>
very little when bureaucracy is involved.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and need not be an indicator of future generations to follow.</i><br>
<p>
Why is that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"that book" predicts otherwise.  Why do you hate it?</i><br>
<p>
Exactly what you said. It's a bleak depressing look at the future. It's an<br>
interesting concept but there are multiple things the book hasn't<br>
meantioned that occurred but didn't fit into their meme. Besides each past<br>
generation has had to become accustomed to the trends of the new. The<br>
spiritual Awakening turn will not solve the problems meantioned in the<br>
unraveling. Just because there alot of people complain about homosexuality<br>
and how it conflicts with christianity won't mean that during the spiritual<br>
awakening homosexuality will go away, people just adjust and become<br>
accustomed to it and their so-called problems 'go away'. Catastrophic<br>
events occur but they aren't linked to social behaviors. Also they meantion<br>
that this book is an american true story. How does the rest of the world<br>
fit into this? Many things going on around the world built up to WWII, it<br>
had nothing to do with the state of society in the unraveling. If this<br>
pattern were true, different societies all around the world would be in<br>
different turns altogether due to cultural differences. How these turns<br>
might interact could bring about different eras if this were true. But they<br>
claim that all of society runs on this central clock. How do they explain<br>
this? Celestial influences? Sunspots? Our location in relation to the rest<br>
of the galaxy? Gravitational influences of the other planets? It's trash.<br>
