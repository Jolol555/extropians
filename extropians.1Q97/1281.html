A Chimpanzee's hand is very dexterous by animal standards but not by human <br>
ones. A chimp still spends most of it's time walking on 4 legs so the hand <br>
must be optimized for locomotion. A chimp does have an opposable thumb of <br>
sorts, but is very short and stubby and the fingers are quite long and that <br>
makes things clumsy. Even more important, in a human the thumb is twisted <br>
90 degrees to the plane of the other fingers, so the hand does not work very <br>
well for walking but works great for precision gripping, placing the thumb <br>
against one of the fingers.<br>
           <br>
3.9 million years ago Lucy had a hand that was FAR more human than the hand <br>
of any ape living today and was almost as good as our own. Lucy's hand did <br>
contain one puzzling flaw, the muscles at the base of her thumb must have <br>
been small, so although her precision gripping was excellent, her power grip, <br>
the placing of the thumb against the entire hand, was weak. Lucy could not<br>
climb trees as well as we can.<br>
<p>
Everybody always assumed that the power grip came first and the precision <br>
grip much latter, and I don't blame them for assuming that, it's very logical, <br>
but that's not what happened. As in History, proving that something is <br>
logical in Evolution is not enough to prove that it happened.<br>
