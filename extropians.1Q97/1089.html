[Hara Ra admonishes Dan Fabulich:]<br>
<i>&gt; One of things I value about this list is the member's love of accuracy</i><br>
<i>&gt; when it comes to provable facts, in this case Special Relativity (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibly General Relativity). Either learn your math or be respectful of</i><br>
<i>&gt; those of us who do know it.</i><br>
<p>
One of the things I could only wish I valued about this list is<br>
hospitality to newcomers, especially nervous ones, and not telling them<br>
to shut up even if they do make an error.<br>
<p>
One of the things I *do* value about this list is the citation and<br>
explanation of facts instead of standing on your authority.<br>
<p>
Special Relativity says that lost time is equal to the 'tau' factor,<br>
equalling:<br>
    __________<br>
   /     v^2<br>
  /  1 - ---<br>
\/       c^2<br>
<p>
Let's suppose you're in an airplane going one mile per second, around<br>
Mach 5 or 6.  This is considerably faster than the Concorde.  This<br>
airplane is going around 1/186000 as fast as a ray of light.   Now v<br>
over c is squared, so tau here is equal to 1 - 1/(186,000 * 186,000), or<br>
around:<br>
.99999999997 or (1 - 0.0000000000289051)<br>
<p>
So if your airplane trip lasted a year, your total loss of time due to<br>
Special Relativity is equal to:<br>
912 microseconds, or just less than one thousandth of a second.<br>
<p>
By comparision, I believe that the smallest interval of time perceptible<br>
to a human is between 10 and 20 thousandths of a second.  You would thus<br>
have to circle the globe two hundred and fourteen thousand times, over<br>
the course of around seventeen years, before losing an amount of time<br>
large enough to perceive.<br>
<p>
(Boy, you don't really appreciate the people who popularize Special<br>
Relativity until you have to strangle yourself to keep from saying<br>
"frame of reference" every six words.)<br>
<p>
Somebody else says that you actually gain time due to General<br>
Relativity, which says that time slows down close to a large mass [i.e.<br>
speeds up in an airplane], but I can't calculate that.<br>
