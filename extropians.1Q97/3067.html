        Keeping an anencephalic (sp?) clone alive would be very expensive,<br>
to say the least.  You can't expect to have your brainless clone acting<br>
exactly how you want it too because it will have no will to do anything that<br>
you tell it.  If it becomes possible to manufacture a clone that has a very<br>
slightly developed brain, then that will delve deeply into an ethical issue<br>
about "what life is."  Food and clothing will be essential, and bathing<br>
would be desired; hygiene will be necessary if you want the parts you'll<br>
take from it to be healthy.  There will probably be some emotional<br>
attachment to this clone, due to the fact that it looks nearly identical to<br>
what you or someone you know once looked, not to mention the build up of<br>
emotional attachment because of the years of "mothering" or "fathering" the<br>
clone.  Imagine having a severely mentally handicapped child for thirty<br>
years then suddenly taking his\her heart or liver.  I would do it if<br>
necessary, but there are definately better alternatives.<br>
<p>
          I think the best idea regarding cloning thus far is the one of<br>
cryogenically freezing an anencephalic clone, then taking its parts *but*<br>
remember that it would have to be grown so that the organs etc. would be<br>
compatible.  Who would raise the clone to that point?  Cloning certainly has<br>
its ups and downs, but I think that there are a lot more feasible methods of<br>
extending life and growing body parts.<br>
