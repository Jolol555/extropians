No.  Why?  Because Darwin/Mendel were explaining how species develop<br>
traits, based on observations in the field.  Galileo and Newton were<br>
discussing how gravity works, based on provable experiments.  This<br>
gender "debate" is about why there aren't many outstanding females in<br>
such important fields as math and science, which has not, as yet, been<br>
supported by evidence.<br>
<p>
The debate here is whether or not women are naturally disinclined to<br>
becoming mathematical geniuses.  There's no question that math is a<br>
field of study mostly reserved to men, and that male genius has gone<br>
further to better our knowledge of math than female genius.  The point<br>
under question is WHY this is true.  Many argue that environment is the<br>
root of this issue; that being raised under conditions which discourage<br>
intelligence, particularly in math, has resulted in a void of female<br>
mathematicians, and hence an absence of female math genius.  Others,<br>
such as Lyle and Mike, have suggested that females in general have less<br>
math ability.  They deny environment as the explanation for the known<br>
data.<br>
<p>
Neither side offers proof.  Can they?  Remember, brutal truth requires<br>
brutal PROOF.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On another hand, why should I care whether or not mathematical genius</i><br>

<p>
Because the answer to this question is critical for those who would<br>
prefer not to be prejudiced by their gender (Have you heard this one?<br>
"I can't believe I got a lower math score than a GIRL!").  It's also a<br>
point of interest for education and the future.  Were women to be<br>
found biologically stunted in their ability to deal with math and<br>
science, some would consider it pointless to try to teach them these<br>
skills which they could never REALLY understand fully.  I don't believe<br>
that will ever be the case, but then, I have no proof.<br>
<p>
Anyway you look at it, the whole issue rests on the absence or presence<br>
of genetic data.  But where's the argument going instead?  Moral<br>
polemic?  Condescension?  Who is or is not a psychology professor?<br>
<p>
Time to give it a rest, or show us some proof.<br>
