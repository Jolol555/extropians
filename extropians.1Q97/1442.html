I suspect most of the gender variation in outomes is best explained by<br>
saying that women tend to want different things from men, rather than<br>
that women have different abilities, or that institutions/culture<br>
discriminate against them.  This is my experience, my wife's<br>
experience, and the basis thesis of the controversial classic "Why Men<br>
Rule".<br>

<p>
Culture and social power structures do influence individual choices,<br>
but are themselves things we need to explain.  A simple natural (but<br>
perhaps wrong) explanation of culturally-constructed genders is that<br>
they are the natural aggregate result of lots of individual probably<br>
genetically-determined differences in what individual women want.  If<br>
we could have always changed gender roles, and haven't, maybe most of<br>
us don't want to.<br>

<p>
I don't think you can sensibly talk about engineering your values.<br>
You can choose your strategies, heuristics, ways of framing<br>
situations, and you can remind yourself of things you value that<br>
aren't naturally highlighted in situations.  But you want what you<br>
want.  If you want to want something else, then how can it be that you<br>
wanted it in the first place?<br>
