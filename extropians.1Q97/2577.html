Some people seem to be using "Truth" as a name for "The nature of<br>
objective reality, in complete detail".  But this isn't useful or<br>
meaningful, because used in this sense, there can be no falsehood:<br>
reality just is, and if one refers to it completely, there can be<br>
nothing that isn't part of that. <br>
<p>
The question, then, is out of that existence, where does the<br>
meaningful notion of true/false come from?  My answer is that<br>
"True" and "False" are properties of /assertions/, so to understand<br>
truth we must first understand the nature of assertion.  I will<br>
simplify by leaving out the communicative sense of the word, and<br>
concentrate solely on assertions made to oneself, so differing<br>
mental models do not complicate the picture.  I will further<br>
simplify by leaving out the notion of time/causality so that we<br>
can imagine a complete universe frozen in time except for the<br>
single mind here making assertions about it.<br>
<p>
What, then, is an assertion?  It is clearly some state, property,<br>
or pattern existing in the mind that /represents/ some part of<br>
reality.  Since our mind is a finite subset of reality, we can't<br>
simply represent the whole thing--that would be just making a copy<br>
of the universe.  We must perform /data compression/.  This, then,<br>
is what I see as the fundamental nature of all thought: we cannot<br>
be omniscient, so we store as much data as we can as compactly as<br>
we can, along with /rules/, i.e., algorithms for reproducing some<br>
representation of reality in greater detail than we have stored.<br>
<p>
The representation of the universe in our mind consists of data,<br>
including sense experience, and algorithms, some perhaps innate and<br>
others created after birth.  Those we create after birth are formed<br>
in much the way a computer performs data compression: by searching<br>
for patterns in the inputs and generating rules the reproduce them<br>
from smaller representations.<br>
<p>
An assertion, then, (to oneself, remember) is a representation of<br>
some of your de-compression rules.  The assertion "I saw a dog this<br>
morning" contains many rules and references to stored data--some<br>
that represent patterns you have found in dogs, mammals, mornings,<br>
your own vision; some rules you have created to represent the<br>
relationship between the stored sense-memories and reality, your<br>
representations of yourself, and hundreds of other rules and data<br>
chunks that serve to produce representations in short-term memory<br>
("recall") for comparison with other recollections and more pattern<br>
finding and rule making.  Patterns can be found in the rules, and<br>
rules can be shared on different datasets, and meta-rules used to<br>
compress sets of rules, etc.<br>
<p>
What is "truth" in the static-universe sense?  It must be stronger<br>
than merely lossless compression--that's just "consistency", in that<br>
no input data are lost.  "Truth" must express a strong relationship<br>
to reality itself--for a rule to be "true" it must not only retain<br>
all data that are put into it, but all /possible/ data.  In other<br>
words, it must losslessly compress /all/ data that represent any<br>
property of whatever parts of reality it is meant to describe.  If<br>
there does not exist any property of reality that the rule would<br>
eliminate, then it is "true".<br>
<p>
Let's get a bit more concrete: Since we do not wish to catalog in<br>
our mind the charge of every particle we meet, we can compress those<br>
data with rules like "those things fitting the description of an<br>
electron in all aspects except charge will have a single fixed value<br>
for charge, either positive or negative."  We can compress data for<br>
other particles with the rule "electrical charges always come<br>
discretely quatized in packets the size of the electron-charge."<br>
If there exists any particle anywhere in the universe that doesn't<br>
fit this pattern, then our rule would produce false data for it, and<br>
it is therefore false.<br>
<p>
How can we determine truth?  I think it's clear that we can't.  We<br>
cannot know that our internal representation of reality covers all<br>
properties of it, or that there does not exist a single counterexample<br>
for any rule, or that we will be able to find all the properties of<br>
reality and a complete set of rules.  We can, however, judge the<br>
consistency of our rules with themselves and the data we apply them<br>
to, and inconsistency is a sufficient condition for falsehood (since<br>
true rules are a superset of consistent rules).<br>
<p>
The quest for truth, then, is a quest for data, and rules sufficient<br>
to compress all the data we need into representations we can use, and<br>
that are never inconsistent.  But since multiple rule sets can be<br>
consistent with all data collected so far, how can we choose among<br>
competing theories?  Heuristics.  How much data does the rule compress<br>
(i.e. expressive power)?  How compactly can we store the rule itself<br>
(i.e. Ockham's razor)?  How many opportunities does the rule afford for<br>
finding counterexamples (i.e. testability)?<br>
