<p>
<p>
No. If for example every member of a set has a value of 10.2 then the entire  <br>
set certainly has a average value of 10.2. Von Neumann wasn't such a fool  <br>
that he didn't realize that there are other ways the average could end up <br>
being that number, but he didn't think they were physically reasonable. <br>
He was wrong about that. <br>
<p>
Speaking of blunders, Bell actually wrote his paper in 1964 and sent it off  <br>
to Reviews of Modern Physics, they promptly misfiled it someplace in their  <br>
vast office. Two years later they finely found it and published it in 1966.  <br>
To treat such a vastly important paper in such a way is a scandal, Reviews of <br>
Modern Physics is no longer in operation.   <br>

<i>        &gt;Supposedly the proof was shown to be flawed in 1935 by Grete Hermann </i><br>
<i>        &gt;on purely mathematical grounds.                 </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I've never heard of Grete Hermann, but he must have pointed out that Von <br>
Neumann's assumptions were too restrictive, Hermann couldn't have pointed to <br>
a mathematical flaw because there are none. I quote from "The Unconscious <br>
Quantum" by Victor J Stenger:<br>
<p>
 "Von Neumann's proof was eventually rejected, not because it did not follow <br>
 from its assumptions but because those assumptions were not all-inclusive." <br>
 [...] the proofs [ in his book] were mathematically correct, insofar as they <br>
 followed from their assumptions, but the assumptions were too restrictive."<br>
<p>
This was only a small part of Von Neumann's 1932 book and it is still  <br>
considered a masterpiece. For example, in it he proved that although they  <br>
look very different, Schrodinger's and Heisenberg's versions of Quantum <br>
Mechanics are logically equivalent.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You say that "There would be nothing illogical about a world that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;worked that way" (referring to one that followed von Neumann's proof)         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;but such a world is one in which microcausality is hopelessly lost,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;which for me, is about as illogical as we can get.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I know of no law of logic the demands that every event have a cause.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;With the modern understanding that advanced-action can reduce all of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the puzzling phenomena of quantum physics down to one concise        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;deterministic explanation, I would say that it's all water under the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;bridge</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Some say  John Cramer's Transactional interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is  <br>
deterministic, but to do so one must stretch the meaning of "deterministic",  <br>
perhaps to the breaking point, it has little to do with our everyday use of  <br>
the word. In everything EXCEPT Quantum Mechanics when we say "A causes B" we<br>
mean that whenever you find A you can be certain to find B further along the <br>
time sequence; this is NOT at all what Cramer means when he talks about  <br>
causes and determinism. This would certainly have horrified Einstein,  <br>
he didn't much like a nondeterministic universe but a non-local one bothered <br>
him far more.                                 <br>
