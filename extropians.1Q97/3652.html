Well, I see some limitations to this, some of which are a bit subtle. I<br>
have thousands of interests, and a profiler is limited to what I tell<br>
it. It may do well with the interests which I express a lot, but I<br>
cannot hope for it to detect my lesser interests. Another limitation is<br>
that there are *always* implicit assumptions in such systems, based on<br>
its design and the bias of its programmers. Would I really trust<br>
Microsoft to build a profile which truly represents my values? I think<br>
not. Since it seems that push technology is a blatantly commercial<br>
aspect of the Net, I expect there will be many hidden biases in the PTs<br>
which I use. And there's always the privacy issue. Finally, if I am<br>
inundated with PT selections I will likely spend less of my time<br>
browsing at random, effectively reducing my scope in the direction of<br>
the PT content.<br>
