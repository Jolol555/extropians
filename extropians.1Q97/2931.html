<i>&gt;&gt;There's a good sci-fi story waiting to get out, about the clone waiting to</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unless I'm mistaken, that's `The Eyeflash Miracles' by Gene Wolfe (1976).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yawn.  I've been grimly entertained by most media commentators (sorry Ravn)</i><br>
<i>&gt;making such remarks, including the scientist in the original news report who</i><br>
<i>&gt;told us he had this *great new sci fi idea* for cloning Jesus.  When Peter</i><br>
<i>&gt;Goldsworthy did this in HONK IF YOU ARE JESUS a few years, I thought it was</i><br>
<i>&gt;an *example* of cloning.  Sorry, team, it's all been done.  Gilbert Gosseyn</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Go-Sane) in van Vogt's Null-A novels was a clone with replacements lurking</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the tank back in the 1940s.  In 1973, Nancy Freedman cloned JFK in</i><br>
<i>&gt;JOSHUA, SON OF NONE.  Kate Wilhelm's WHERE LATE THE SWEET BIRDS SANG, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;classic clone novel, came out in 1976 (winning the Hugo award for year's</i><br>
<i>&gt;best sf novel) and canvassed most of the possibilities, as did Pam</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sargeant's CLONED LIVES the same year.  Varley is crawling with these plots,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Egan carries them further.  Even a late-comer like Lois McMaster Bujold</i><br>
<i>&gt;has done it.  Her recent Miles Vorkosigan novel (the titles of these</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ruritanian entertainments drift away) used a nasty world where rich</i><br>
<i>&gt;dictators had bodies grown and exercised for later transplant.  The kids</i><br>
<i>&gt;were not decorticated (have you ever seen the kind of body that results from</i><br>
<i>&gt;microcephaly?), but trained with a kind of ideology/religion that made them</i><br>
<i>&gt;happily anticipate their merging with, for example, The Lady...  My point?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not just justice to my fellow sf laborers in the fields, but a pointer to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;vast ream of elaborate material where many of the worst and best scenarios</i><br>
<i>&gt;have long since been amusingly explored.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Damien Broderick</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Also, the Boys from Brazil by Ira Levin, about cloned Hitlers raised post<br>
war in Brazil.  Mona Liza Overdrive by William Gibson had a fabulously<br>
wealthy clan that cloned itself.  <br>
