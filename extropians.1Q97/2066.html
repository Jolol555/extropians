In his very provocative post of Thursday, Jan 30, Omega wrote <br>

<i>&gt; 2. FOURIER SPACES:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; While Godel defined one form of incompleteness, there is another </i><br>
<i>&gt; form that is equally significant, and that is the incompleteness of </i><br>
<i>&gt; one coordinate space for defining in a simple form all possible </i><br>
<i>&gt; localizations and correlations that can exist within mathematical </i><br>
<i>&gt; reality.  </i><br>
<p>
Coordinate space?  How 'bout coordinate system?  Do you really want <br>
to put the coordinate systems themselves into a space of their own?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In math these are the spaces that are defined by the myriad Fourier </i><br>
<i>&gt; waveform families.   </i><br>
<p>
Do waveforms come in families?   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For those into music, this leads into the distinctions between the </i><br>
<i>&gt; relative ease or difficulty that analog and digital synthesizers have </i><br>
<i>&gt; in reproducing certain forms of music.  For those in physics, this is </i><br>
<i>&gt; the mathematical basis for Heisenberg uncertainty.  But in both cases, </i><br>
<i>&gt; we are looking at a basic mathematical principle manifesting itself </i><br>
<i>&gt; in our reality.  </i><br>
<p>
Hmm...  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is also the reason why computers are such idiot savants, </i><br>
<i>&gt; they are hard-wired to the Fourier space defined by their RAM's </i><br>
<i>&gt; linear address space.  </i><br>
<p>
Now wait a minute.  First of all, non-mathematical readers should be <br>
warned that "Fourier space" is not a standard mathematical concept.  <br>
Apparently it was freshly minted for the occasion, like my "deity space" <br>
of a few weeks ago.  One applies a Fourier transform to a function to <br>
yield another function.  The functions themselves live in a space called a <br>
Hilbert space.  <br>
<p>
You seem to be saying that functions can be separated into equivalence <br>
classes.  The functions in one equivalence class (or "Fourier space" or <br>
"waveform family") are interconvertible with other functions in the <br>
same class, but not with the functions in other classes.  This is news to <br>
me.  (Which doesn't mean you're wrong; a lot of things are news to me.  <br>
But I think some explanation is called for.)  Any function that satisfies <br>
the Dirichlet conditions (piecewise continuous and square-integrable) <br>
can be Fourier-transformed.  Nicht wahr?  And the same sines and <br>
cosines are used for all functions...  so where do the equivalence classes <br>
come from?  <br>
<p>
As for computers being "hard-wired to the Fourier space defined by <br>
their RAM's linear address space" -- I have no idea what this means.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Software can work around this to some extent, but without </i><br>
<i>&gt; special hardware, no computer is ever going to operate as efficiently </i><br>
<i>&gt; in other Fourier spaces as the default one defined by its hardware.  </i><br>
<p>
All computers are mathematically equivalent, aren't they?  <br>
One Turing machine can do anything another Turing machine can do.  <br>
Are you referring to the fact that different chips have different <br>
instruction sets?  What does this have to do with Fourier analysis?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The human brain is so flexible because it contains the ability to </i><br>
<i>&gt; look at things from radically different viewpoints.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, the essential thing is that the human brain can look at things <br>
from a viewpoint.  Computers are idiot savants because they have <br>
no viewpoint.  They have no general model of the world.  They have   <br>
no organs of perception, and no language (in the human sense of <br>
"language" -- C and Java are not languages in the sense that English  <br>
and Sanskrit are languages).  <br>
<p>
Nevertheless, in spite of all this criticism, I think you are onto <br>
something.  On an intuitive level, I think I see what you are getting at.  <br>
I'm not sure the concept of "Fourier space" can be made rigorous, <br>
but it is a thought-provoking idea.  <br>
<p>
The essential ideas of Fourier analysis are <br>
(1) Analyzing something into its components.  A function is the sum of   <br>
a series of sines and cosines.  This is analogous to saying that a point <br>
(x,y,z) in 3-space is the sum of (x,0,0) + (0,y,0) + (0,0,z).  Functions, <br>
however, require an infinite number of "coordinates".    <br>
<p>
(2)  Duality.  Given a function of time, one applies a Fourier transform <br>
to obtain a function of frequency;  then one applies a transform to this <br>
function, and the result is... the same function of time that we started <br>
with.  Thus, functions come in Fourier pairs.  Alternatively, we can say <br>
that the "same" function exists in the time domain and in the frequency <br>
domain.  <br>
<p>
Now, the instruction set of a chip could be viewed as the "coordinates" <br>
with which the chip represents problems, and the "Fourier space" would <br>
be the set of programs that can be (simply or efficiently) written using <br>
this instruction set -- is that what you mean when you say a computer <br>
is "hard-wired to a Fourier space"?  If so, I think it's confusing to bring <br>
Fourier analysis into it.  <br>
<p>
Instead of using Fourier analysis as the basis of this whole discussion, <br>
it would be better to start with a general idea of representing things with <br>
coordinates, and then Fourier series would be a special case of this -- <br>
not necessarily the canonical case.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  3. FOURIER SPACES &amp; CULTURE:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless a person is both able and willing to switch to a different </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fourier space, they literally can not understand what the other person</i><br>
<i>&gt; is talking about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact they not only will not be able to answer the questions </i><br>
<i>&gt; that are defined in that Fourier space, there's no guarantee that they </i><br>
<i>&gt; will be able to even grasp the question.  </i><br>
<p>
Ok.  Now  your point is getting clearer.  You are conceiving language <br>
as based on semantic primitives, or coordinates, and the "Fourier space" <br>
is everything that can be (simply or efficiently) expressed using certain <br>
coordinates, i.e. a person's basic vocabulary.  Again, I'm not sure that <br>
trying to base this whole discussion on sines and cosines is the best way <br>
to proceed.   <br>
<p>
But then -- <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; With this more or less fixed pattern of viewpoints, plus at least some </i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of built in reluctance to surf though the myriad alternative </i><br>
<i>&gt; viewpoints, together with an evolutionary requirement that our </i><br>
<i>&gt; viewpoints harden as we age so as to selectively propagate the memes </i><br>
<i>&gt; that got one to parenthood (and later on to the status of "wise elder") </i><br>
<i>&gt; we find that we have defined, in a very natural way, the very basis for </i><br>
<i>&gt; ego-identity along with its normally decreasing flexibility with age.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe I should try being a wise elder instead of a cantankerous <br>
old fart! <br>
