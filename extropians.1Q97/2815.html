Here's just one snippet from one of the web sites Sean points us to:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        Dr. Patrick Dixon, author of “The Genetic Revolution,” said the</i><br>
advance<br>
<i>&gt;  had “horrendous” implications. ‘What is its value if it comes with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  enormous risk of some nut trying to clone himself?’</i><br>
<i>&gt; — DR. RICHARD NICHOLSON</i><br>
<i>&gt;Editor, "Bulletin of Medical Ethics"</i><br>
<i>&gt;        “We will probably be able to recover the dead from</i><br>
<i>&gt;their bodies before they die. In this way, parents could</i><br>
<i>&gt;‘reproduce’ a carbon copy of a child who tragically died,”</i><br>
<i>&gt;he told The Sunday Telegraph. “This is something that</i><br>
<i>&gt;needs to be regulated and outlawed.”</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Dr. Richard Nicholson, editor of the “Bulletin of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Medical Ethics,” told The Sunday Telegraph he was</i><br>
<i>&gt;surprised the government had sanctioned the experiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;        “It was a nice technical problem, but what is its value</i><br>
<i>&gt;if it comes with the enormous risk of some nut trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;clone himself?” he asked.</i><br>
<p>
Clearly, this will precipitate a firestorm of discussion and a lot of<br>
reactions like those quoted above.  I suggest we focus very closely on the<br>
public reaction and use the List here to share any information about<br>
developing attempts to outlaw this technology.  Assuming this result is<br>
verified, it obviously has tremendous potential.  I'm almost sorry it<br>
happened before our ideas have had more time to take root and serve as a<br>
memetic inocculation against this sort of knee-jerk response. . .<br>
