    &lt;&lt;     Thanks Nadia.  That was basically my point in the contributions I<br>
 made to the "Political Correctness According To Hugo de Garis" thread.  I<br>
 believe that some people tend to *want* a rift between genders...be them<br>
 male or female.  That, I think, is unfortunate.  'Genius' can (obviously,<br>
 IMO) be either male or female.  If one person says that this fact is<br>
 otherwise, I don't understand how the majority of the listeners don't just<br>
 brush it off as foolhardy.  That is mainly the reason why I wished the<br>
 "Political Correctness" thread to be quelled...it is insulting to our<br>
 intelligence (again, IMO).<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, thats the whole problem with the "battle of the sexes" - NO ONE WANTS TO<br>
RESOLVE IT - or IMHO the battle between scienctist and artist, objectivists<br>
and subjectivists, prohibition, pick you favorite "old battles"...<br>
<p>
The victim status is a hard one to relinquish, and as long as we have these<br>
battles, we will have victims. As long as we have to have battles that are<br>
fought again and again ( and it's not just being done intellectually but<br>
globally, and violently) then we all have a nice codependent excuse not to<br>
improve our lot.<br>
