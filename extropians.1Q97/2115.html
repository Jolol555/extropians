<i>&gt; There exists another fun calculation that allows you to find the x:th</i><br>
<i>&gt; digit of pi in O(something small) without calculating the previous d-1</i><br>
<i>&gt; digits, this has been used to calculate the ten billionth digit of pi; see</i><br>

Ah.  Then given 64 qb, you could search every 1000 consecutive digits of<br>
pi for hidden messages for the first sixteen billion billion digits of<br>
pi, in (of course) the same time it would take to search any 1000<br>
digits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I wonder if there is some way of calculating pi faster on a quantum </i><br>
<i>&gt; computer.</i><br>
Easy as... I can't say it.  But any way, yeah, assuming you have 4GB<br>
quantum-writable memory, and a 32qb processor, you can assign each<br>
branch a byte of memory to write to, and calculate the first 330 billion<br>
digits of pi in very little time.  On the other hand, you only need a<br>
trivial amount of memory, like a few KB of QRAM, to check for secret<br>
messages as much of pi as you have the qubits for.  Assuming that only<br>
one branch of reality indicates success.<br>
<p>
That brings me to a question:  What do we need for quantum-writable<br>
memory?  Anything exotic?  And by the way, why do we need (say) 45<br>
qubits to factor a 15-bit number?  Shouldn't 15 qubits be enough to test<br>
every possible divisor of a 15-bit number?<br>
