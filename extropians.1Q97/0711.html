Here you are underestimating the unused potential of the capacity of the<br>
human mind. A computer is made to work at the max of his capacity, a human<br>
mind isn't. Any control over 'capability' should be in the hands of the<br>
individual, not pre-set, dogmatic, and hard to adapt to reality,<br>
philosophies or epistimologies, designed by people who may (help) invent<br>
something, but never come to make any practical use of it. <br>
<p>
'Capacity without control is like a rocket propelled car' ?<br>
Capacity with control is like a car moving slowly into ONE direction,<br>
capacity with individual control is like a million cars propelled in all<br>
directions, increasing the chances one will arrive at a destination.<br>
