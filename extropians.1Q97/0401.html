What, like my 1550/1600 SAT or my 35/36 ACT scores?  Twit.  I say the<br>
SAT isn't worth diddly because I did well on it, and know what it took<br>
to do so.  Well, it is worth diddly, but it certainly isn't a measure of<br>
general intelligence, if such exists, or of creativity.<br>

"Does it occur to you, the fallibility of CIT thinking?  Flux-thinking.<br>
You have prophetic dreams, remember?  You can dream about a man drinking<br>
a glass of milk.  A week later you can see Yanni drinking tea at lunch<br>
and if seeing him do that has a high shock-value, you'll super the<br>
dream-state right over him, you'll swear you dreamed about him doing<br>
that, exactly at that table, and even psychprobe can't sort it out after<br>
that." -- C.J. Cherryh, _Cyteen_, Grant ALX<br>

my post -- or what I was replying to.)<br>
