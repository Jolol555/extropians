A few random thoughts on this subject:<br>
<p>
<p>
1) No matter what happens, the clone will be wholly different from the<br>
'clonee' at the point of cloning.  As I stated a few months back in my<br>
theory of consciousness, the clone and the clonee will be their own<br>
entities.  Even in the most sheltered cases, the clone will at least have<br>
a different point of view as the clonee.  The streams of consciousness will<br>
ultimately be different between the two.  The cells that replenish and die<br>
will be different cells; for example, if the clone accidentally scratches<br>
his\her\its hand, the replenishment of cells will take a different course<br>
than the cells on the unscratched hand of the clonee.<br>
In effect, the likeness of the clones (not particularly physical likeness)<br>
will gradually differ.<br>

                  pre-cloning         /<br>

                                      \<br>
                                       \<br>
                                        \<br>
<p>
<p>
2) In some ways, it is unfortunate that this cloning technology didn't<br>
develop until after an adequate space program had been established.  As Hal<br>
Finney mentioned, it will take the general population a while to warm up to<br>
the idea of cloning.  I think it would be quite beneficial to send an<br>
umpteen amount of individual clones on a number of spaceships heading in<br>
various directions to colonize distant planets etc.  Not to say that this<br>
won't happen eventually.<br>
<p>
3) I wonder (in the advent that this technology becomes usable within a few<br>
decades) if there will be a prejudice or a fear towards clones.  With the<br>
lack of tolerance and acceptance for many 'minority' groups today (however<br>
irrational it may be) such as gays and different races, it is possible that<br>
clones will be dubbed as 'abnormal' or --as I can envision religious groups<br>
protesting-- sacreligious and blasphemous.  That would be unfortunate, in<br>
that it would be a regressive step.<br>
