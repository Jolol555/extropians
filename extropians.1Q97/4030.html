<i>&gt; &gt;Doesn't this treat "evidence" as if it were a continuous quantity?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;As if it just piles up in front of each theory to give it weight (in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fact, the very phrase "weight of evidence" assumes this).  ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.  Relative weight of evidence = log likelihood ratio, which adds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These comments suggest to me that you are simply ignorant of the vast</i><br>
<i>&gt; literature on the relations between theory and evidence.  </i><br>
<p>
Ignorant of it or just not impressed by it?  "Your comments, Copernicus,<br>
suggest that you are ignorant of the vast scholarly literature on the<br>
central place of Earth in the heavens."<br>
<p>
I invest my valuable time studying those fields that have been shown<br>
to me to be most useful to my understanding of the nature of things:<br>
evolution, game theory, economics, physics, philosophy, etc.  If I<br>
have missed any works that you consider vital, it is because they have<br>
not convinced me (or those whose opinions I do value) that they are<br>
worth the time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course evidence varies in strength.  If you happen to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; available a particularly strong peice of evidence which no one else</i><br>
<i>&gt; has yet seen, then of course this may outweigh all else.  But what if </i><br>
<i>&gt; all those experts have seen this new experiment and their opinions</i><br>
<i>&gt; have not much changed.  The question then is:  how sure are you that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have not missed or misunderstood some aspect of the experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt; that seems to you to offer such strong support?</i><br>
<p>
Why do you simply refuse to accept the fact that in all periods of human<br>
history, the vast hordes of people--including the best minds of each<br>
generation--were simply wrong about most things?  It doesn't mean that<br>
they were irrational, necessarily.  Aristotle was a brilliant man in<br>
his time, and those who chose to accept his ideas did relatively well<br>
compared to those who did not.  But nonetheless, almost everything they<br>
believed was wrong in significant ways. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But you are just as likely to object to this common practice out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fear, predispositions, etc.  If anyone anywhere is actually looking at</i><br>
<i>&gt; relevant evidence with some understanding, why is it so much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely to be just you, rather than some influential fraction of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; billions?</i><br>
<p>
That's a fair question; you're right, I might possibly be predisposed<br>
or fearful as well.  This is a judgment I simply have to make.  How do<br>
I judge my own ability to evaluate evidence as compared to others?  As<br>
it happens, I honestly believe that I am more capable of reliable<br>
evaluation of evidence than almost everyone I have ever met or read.<br>
That's a personal evaluation, from personal experience, so it is hard<br>
to justify to others, especially those accustomed to deference to<br>
authority (or authorities themselves, like the doctor I once fired).<br>
But it is an evaluation I make without reservation.<br>
