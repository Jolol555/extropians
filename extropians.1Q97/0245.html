<i>&gt;You then form an infinite sum, adding each estimated future dividend</i><br>

<i>&gt;and that, according to this model, would be the stock's value for you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Average this over all market participants and you get the stock price.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now consider how this model works as we approach an era where industrial</i><br>
<i>&gt;production grows explosively, due to nanotech, or AI, or self-reproducing</i><br>
<i>&gt;cheap robots, or some other breakthrough. This can cause returns from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;stock to begin increasing at a rapid rate, even faster than the discount</i><br>
<i>&gt;factor reduces them.  The result could be that the infinite sum above</i><br>
<i>&gt;diverges!  The stock will in fact, today, have an infinite value to you.</i><br>
<p>
 This assumes the discount rate is unaffected by the explosive economic<br>
growth. But what sane person would use a discount rate that is significantly<br>
lower than the economic growth rate?<br>
<p>
 It makes no sense to pay more for a stock than it would cost to<br>
create a similar new company. While there some assets that can't<br>
be quickly duplicated (Bill Gates' brain, Nabisco's reputation, etc),<br>
I don't see how they can explain why people would pay orders of<br>
magnitude more for stock shares than it would cost to start a<br>
similar company.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Right now not many people would believe this reasoning.  But as we</i><br>
<i>&gt;approach a singularity era, and more and more people start to sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;"great things just beyond the horizon", it will become more accepted that</i><br>
<i>&gt;owning productive resources is going to be the ticket to future wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt;beyond imagining.  Stocks and other productive assets will become</i><br>
<i>&gt;overwhelmingly attractive.  We will see a sudden transition to a regime</i><br>
<i>&gt;where everyone expends all other resources to buy stocks.  The result</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be a one-time transition, an explosion in stock prices.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This would not be a conventional speculative bubble, where people invest</i><br>
<i>&gt;just to get temporary gains from the ongoing price rises, but rather a</i><br>
<p>
 The majority of people who buy near the peak of a bubble think they<br>
are long term investors buying at the start of a new era (usually with<br>
rationalizations like those in Lyle's parody).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would expect the financial explosion to occur a few years to perhaps a</i><br>
<i>&gt;few decades before the productivity explosion, depending on how farsighted</i><br>
<p>
 What would cause the value of labor to decline relative to capital<br>
years before the cost of duplicating human-level intelligence is<br>
reduced?<br>
 What would cause the value of cash and cash-like assets to decline?<br>
One of the reasons that these assets have value is the ability they<br>
provide to quickly move one's assets into new (unanticapted) investments.<br>
Since my intuition is that the period you are talking about will<br>
produce enormous uncertainties about which companies will produce<br>
or benefit from breakthroughs in nanotech or AI, I expect I will<br>
value cash fairly highly.<br>
