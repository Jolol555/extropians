Tom:<br>
<i>&gt; What...constitutes a universal Schelling point?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I offer a tentative answer:...the galactic center.</i><br>
<p>
The classic example, as Tom mentioned, is where to meet in Paris if<br>
no prior agreement was made.  As potential tourists, we tend to find<br>
the answer of the Eiffel tower satisfactory.<br>
However, if we were artists, and in Europe to visit art museums, <br>
we might choose the Louvre.<br>
<p>
Given just a slight variation on the character of the participants,<br>
a different answer seems quite reasonable.  A larger variation, to<br>
a methane-breathing BEM, makes almost anything seem reasonable, as<br>
long as it is important to the BEM.  He may find the discharge pipe<br>
from Paris' nuclear power plant particularly facinating.<br>
<p>
However, the one constant that sticks out in all of these is uniqueness.<br>
<p>
Try the previous examples with multiplicity: if Eiffel had built two<br>
similar towers, which one do you choose?  If the Uffizi were also in<br>
Paris?  If Paris has two nuclear power plants?  None of them work anymore.<br>
<p>
The BEM's view of the world may be terribly different from ours, but<br>
I'll wager that he can distiquish 'one' from 'many'.  (He has to<br>
be able to, if he can handle the concept of a Schelling point.)<br>
Thus he can reach the same conclusion about uniqueness that we can.<br>
<p>
With this in mind, Tom's suggestion of the galactic center may not<br>
be facetious.  The center may be impractical if there is a big black<br>
hole there, but it is unique.<br>
<p>
While it is not clear to me if the entire discussion is about physical<br>
locations or points on the radio frequency spectrum, the classic<br>
'waterhole' does not appear unique.  It is one of many frequencies that<br>
has good penetration characteristics.  It may seem natural to us water<br>
based critters, but a hydroxyl group may be arcane chemistry to the BEM.<br>
<p>
There is not only the 'what frequency' question, but 'where do we<br>
aim the antenna.'<br>
<p>
The fastest solution may be to solve the FTL problem ( or at least<br>
fast sublight ), send a transmitter to the galactic center or other <br>
unique galactic feature, and broadcast from there.<br>
