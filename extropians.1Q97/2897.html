Hmm, according to Swedish law a collage can be copyrighted, even if it <br>
includes parts of copyrighted work. So if you define yourself to be an <br>
artwork (Automorph artwork), the at least in Sweden I think you could <br>
copyright your genome (I'll discuss it with a lawyer friend. Maybe I <br>
could do it). <br>

Good point. Of course, using genetic engineering, surgery or cosmetics <br>
appearance can be enhanced too. So maybe we will see a future where some <br>
people clone beautiful people just to be safe, and others dare to compose <br>
new appearances. Hmm, there is a sf story in that...<br>
