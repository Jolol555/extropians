In a message dated 97-03-22 10:40:58 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; It sounds like you have already been brainwashed by this person's own<br>
 clinical depression.  Now it's YOUR responsibility not to get dragged into<br>
 the same depression.<br>
<i>   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It is true that the message this person departed to "Velociman'' may be<br>
depressing to transhumanists. It certainly is true that a dynamic optimist<br>
would not let him/herself be dragged into this level of thinking.<br>
BUT- if this sentiment guarantees 'clinical' 'unipolar'depression the whole<br>
planet may be suffering from the condition and a good dose of medication in<br>
the water supply would make all of our philosophizing obsolete.<br>
Is it diagnosis from an armchair? I am not saying you are hand waving,<br>
perhaps you are a psychiatrist and have the correct data for diagnosis, or<br>
first hand knowledge of the party. Perhaps you have a strong case for your<br>
assertions. <br>
<p>
I liked these two posts, both were intriguing enough to delurk me from the<br>
list reading/deleting position.<br>
I see it as positive, not negative. Please address these issues openly and<br>
agressively.<br>
These people raise serious important questions and fears about Transhuman and<br>
Extropian goals, which are addressed somewhat in the writings of Max More on<br>
tthe website, but I could gladly see discussed more.<br>
Especially the 'sour lunch' thread gave me much food for thought. I could<br>
relate, because i address these same concerns in many a conversation.<br>
 Ayn Rand was stubborn about not addressing a lot of issues, blythely<br>
dismissing people with hand waving judgementalizing (perhaps accurate, but<br>
not always), and it earned her some disdain in intellectual circles.This is<br>
unfortunate, since so much of her philosophy is useful in reasoning through<br>
the many issues of 'negative' people's concern. Refusal to take other<br>
people's concerns seriously, especially when raised in polite, rational ways,<br>
will not serve us as knowledge seekers or in spreading memes. It can also<br>
create blind spots in our own psyche (IMHO).<br>
 <br>
<p>
One of the things I enjoy most about Extropians is the less dogmatic approach<br>
to theories. I have seen a few 'rigid' thinkers on this list, but usally even<br>
they are open to being persuaded, if and only if - someone can prove them to<br>
be wrong. They welcome this, in an honest attempt to improve self and<br>
knowledge of objective reality. And skeptics in general must keep an open<br>
mind, for that is the in definition of skeptic.<br>
