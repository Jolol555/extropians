<i>&gt; The standard Libertarian (and Republican) belief is that free market</i><br>
<i>&gt; economies inherently favor the smartest, hardest working</i><br>
<i>&gt; entrepreneurs and best products.  This is true.  But they also hold</i><br>
<i>&gt; a belief that this principle causes free market economies to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; inherently stable and fair.  This is not true.</i><br>
<p>
If you have such bizarre ideas about what a free market is, no wonder<br>
you have reservations.  Free markets don't encourage the best products,<br>
and never have.  They encourage the economically most efficient products.<br>
If you have a quality product, but it costs a dollar more than people<br>
can pay for an inferior one, or it came to market a few weeks later,<br>
you'd better not bet your mortgage on it.  Just look at the software<br>
industry: a buggy product /now/ is "better" than a stable product in a<br>
month, because people can do real work with it, get used to it, show<br>
it to their friends, create data dependent on it, etc.<br>
<p>
"Stable" is exactly what a free market isn't--and why it's superior to<br>
any possible planned market.  Stability is stagnation.  Stability is<br>
death.  The free market is just that--free.  Wild, careless, changing,<br>
ALIVE.  "Fair" is a moral judgment, and since we agoriarchists define<br>
the free market as the consequence of the moral principle that coercive<br>
force is never justified to transfer property, it is the only system<br>
that can be moral by definition.  If you have some other definition of<br>
"fair", say, the most egalitarian in result, or the least random in<br>
result, or the highest correlation of effort with reward, then some<br>
system other than the free market might have that property, but it will<br>
require coercion and will likely be less productive than a free market. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Those who control great wealth can win even when market dynamics</i><br>
<i>&gt; should have made it otherwise.  Likewise, those who control little</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth will often not see rewards that reflect their level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; prodictivity, thus diminishing the incentive to be productive.</i><br>
<p>
This is a common arguent, but plainly at odds with the evidence.  In<br>
the one time in history when the US had about the freest market (in<br>
the late 1800s), Standard Oil used every dirty trick in the book--<br>
price fixing, undercutting, cartels, tying agreements with railroads,<br>
even physical intimidation of competitors, to buy up over 85% of the<br>
market in petroleum.  They never could get up to 90%, and after they<br>
peaked they started falling, despite continued anti-competitive<br>
practices.  By the time congress decided to meddle with the Sherman<br>
Act (yes, /before/ the act was passed), their market share was 65%<br>
and falling.  The Sherman Act actually helped them by preventing<br>
their competitors from colluding against them.  No monopoly at any<br>
time in history existed without government support.  Before you use<br>
"monopolies" as an example if market failure, name one.  Just one.<br>
One single example if a free-market monopoly taking advantage of its<br>
position to people's detriment.  You can't--it's a myth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Capitalism is good, but it is not perfect.  We can address the</i><br>
<i>&gt; imperfections and create an economy that works, or we can deny the</i><br>
<i>&gt; imperfections and create one that does not.</i><br>
<p>
As soon as you define "perfect" and "working", I'll be able to argue<br>
rationally.  Until you do, your words are meaningless.  I have<br>
defined my terms for you: a free market is the consequence of the<br>
principle that coercive force is /never/ justified to take property.<br>
Now that principle will have certain consequences about which we can<br>
rationally argue.  But you must name them precisely and define them<br>
objectively--stop using words like "fair", "just", or "good" until<br>
you tell me what they mean.  If you have a specific meaning in mind,<br>
it may well be that a free market won't accomplish that, and I'll be<br>
the first one to tell you it doesn't.   In fact, it's likely that<br>
what you have in mind for those words is not possible at all, under<br>
any system.<br>
