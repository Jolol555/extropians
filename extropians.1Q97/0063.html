This sounds reasonable, but quite unstable; the positronium will radiate <br>
away its angular momentum and slowly spiral into anihilation in this <br>
scenario, unless it could in some way be refreshed. Hmm, speaking of <br>
refreshing things, maybe one could still use baryons (after all, they are <br>
so much more versatile) if they were created out of spare leptons and <br>
energy. Most of the universe would run on a very low-density baryon <br>
hardware, which occasionally would have one small section collapse into a <br>
black hole. It would then be replaced with fresh baryons, and the energy <br>
of the black hole extracted. to create baryons again. Since black hole <br>
formation would be far slower than black hole evaporation, this would <br>
probably work (with some net energy losses). <br>

I'll take a look at it. I have been trying to see what happens if you <br>
patch together two Friedman universes with positive and negative <br>
curvatures, but it doesn't seem to work (that may be due to my <br>
regrettable lack of skills in practical GR).<br>
<p>
Making black holes doesn't work for this, since the eventual singularity <br>
is of the wrong kind. Irritating. But maybe one could create some odd <br>
perturbation to get the right kind of "Bianchi IX-like" singularity to <br>
get an OP. <br>
