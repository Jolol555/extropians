You write:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Of course, this is a politically impossible scenario, as the vast</i><br>
majority of people having kids cannot rationally afford to have them<br>
when they do, adn would go on the warpath against anyone trying to<br>
interfere with their right to reproduce. But think about it. Just as one<br>
must demonstrate financial responsibility to drive a car in most states<br>
(insurance), people should have to demostrate financial responsibility<br>
to have kids. <br>

This idea violates Edwards' law regarding kids:
<p>
If you wait until you have the time and money for them, you'll never have them.
I had mine in graduate school.  I was starving.  I'm still starving, but the
kids are doing fine.
