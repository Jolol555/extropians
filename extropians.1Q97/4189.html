This seems similar to myths like "rich people are often unhappy" or<br>
"geniuses are usually slightly mad". They reassure the poorer and less<br>
brilliant people that they still are better in some respects than the<br>
billionaires and Einstein. There is a similar myth that many stupid or <br>
retarded people are actually quite happy.<br>
<p>
This is actually relevant to our transhuman endeavors: we want to become <br>
rich, smart and happy beyond the wildest dreams of present humanity, and <br>
we won't choose one of three, we want three of three. No wonder many <br>
people have a hard time accepting it. <br>
