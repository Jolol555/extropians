<i>&gt; On topics such as physics or computers, most people are willing, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; anxious to admit that they don't know very much, and they are willing</i><br>
<i>&gt; to defer to a surprizing degree to people who specialize in such topics.</i><br>
<p>
Physicists and programmers can readily point to simple, repeatable<br>
experiments that conclusively demonstrate their principles.  Someone<br>
who didn't want to believe that electricity comes in discrete chunks<br>
needs only to set up Millikan's oil-drop apparatus and see for himself.<br>
A program either produces correct output or it does not.  It is not<br>
subject to interpretation or outside influence.<br>
<p>
Political "truths" are not on such solid ground.  Certainly, some<br>
things can be tested, such as computer simulations of economic models.<br>
Even then, the models must make some assumptions about human behavior,<br>
which is notoriously not amenable to precise simulation.  One can<br>
also look to some degree at historical data, but even that is subject<br>
to thousands of overlapping factors, human whims, and historical lies.<br>
Finally, political ideas often rest on normative foundations, so<br>
people with different norms will not agree, regardless of how much<br>
deduction one does from them.<br>
<p>
That's why I may appear, in your words, "confident"; perhaps even<br>
dogmatic.  It's not that I am unwilling to be convinced otherwise,<br>
it's just that doing so is extraordinarily more difficult than in<br>
clearer fields like physics.<br>
<p>
I am quite willing to defer to your years of education in describing<br>
how existing governments function, or what the results of certain<br>
changes might be, and even what the historical record of governance<br>
tells us about human nature.  But all that doesn't change my free<br>
will, or my free choice to rise above my nature and form a society<br>
by completely different rules.  To move me, you must appeal to my<br>
moral philosophy directly--you must convince me that my moral choices<br>
will result in something even worse than the bloody tyrannies I have<br>
seen every other philosophy degrade to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see this behavior on this list as well.   Why?  Why so few</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualifiers and "I don't know"s on political topics?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, of course part of what brings us together is an interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-capitalist type political institutions.  But why are so many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of you so damn confident that you know how such things would actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; function, or which minute variation would actually be best?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Social systems are perhaps the most complex systems we know, and for</i><br>
<i>&gt; which our ignornance should be the most vivid.  Why is this so hard to</i><br>
<i>&gt; admit? </i><br>
<p>
I don't have a problem admitting that I don't know how any particular<br>
A-C system would operate in real life, and I am quite willing to admit<br>
that there are gaps like intellectual property and land covenants and<br>
child care that aren't all neatly tied up in a working package.  But<br>
still, none of that changes the moral foundations, which, in the end,<br>
are a matter of choice.  One can reason /from/ them--one can reason<br>
that certain moral codes are likely to produce certain results, and<br>
that if those results are undesirable, one should change the normative<br>
axioms.  But one cannot reason /toward/ a moral choice.  In the end,<br>
the desirability of means and ends is a value, a free choice.<br>
<p>
Individual liberty and responsibility are axiomatic values for me.<br>
I believe they will result in a system that minimizes coercive force,<br>
which is also an axiomatic value.  Arguments can be made that I am<br>
wrong, that my axioms will lead to results other than what I expect,<br>
but to prove that to me is much more difficult than just pointing me<br>
to an oil-drop experiment.  We can't just set up two planets and<br>
watch for a millennium.<br>
