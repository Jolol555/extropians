Would the table fail the test if it responded saying, "I do not<br>
understand. Could you please rephrase your statement?" I personally do<br>
not comprehend every obscure analogy that I hear either, and thus have<br>
to respond in the the aforementioned fashion. Does this mean that I<br>
would fail the Turing test? <br>
<p>
Imagine the computer is confronted with a statement which it has no<br>
reply for. What if it were then to say, "I do not understand the<br>
question. If I were asking you the same question, how would you reply?"<br>
Once it was given a response it could then store the question and the<br>
reply in its table. Thus the next time it was confronted with this<br>
question it would have a response. There are certainly faults here, the<br>
computer would of course be particularly gullible, recording any kind of<br>
nonsense some one might offer it, but it still seems to me like a step<br>
towards learning ... no matter how simplistic. To reduce its gullibility<br>
or to increase its apparent intelligence, the computer might run some<br>
simple checks on the reply similar to those we use in forms<br>
verification, e.g., you ask for someone's email address and you have cgi<br>
or javascript check to make sure there is an ampersand in the reply.<br>
With a little thought, I'm sure this could get a bit more useful, but if<br>
the computer came to the conclusion that it might be being "toyed" with,<br>
it could respond, "Are you sure that is a valid response to your<br>
question?" If the person replied "no", the computer could scrap the<br>
whole thing, but if the person said "yes, it is", the computer could be<br>
programmed to always accept it as if everyone was honest, or it might<br>
determine by some other means, fuzzy logic perhaps, if it wants to risk<br>
the chance of keeping the statement and reply within its table for<br>
future use.<br>
<p>
I'm not too thoroughly familiar with this ... so bash away.<br>
