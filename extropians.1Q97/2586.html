<p>
Yes, both were early influences, Heidegger much more so than Derrida. I<br>
certainly have vestiges of both lingering within me. I imagine however<br>
that I am influenced in some fashion by everything and everyone I read,<br>
be it by questioning and accepting parts, or questioning and finding<br>
alternatives to parts, or by taking disparate elements between what I<br>
have read and trying to create a "transcending" synthesis. The idea of<br>
sythesis comes from Hegel, though he believed that synthesis would<br>
finally lead to Ultimate Truth or a knowledge of Ultimate Reality. So<br>
here I employ Hegel's idea of synthesis without particularly subscribing<br>
to his loftier beliefs regarding it. We tend to think of influences as<br>
that which we have most embraced, but I would also consider myself<br>
highly influenced by people such as Plato due to the depth of my<br>
disagreement with their thought.   <br>
<p>
For those not familiar with the term, 'ontotheological' was used to<br>
illustrate how preceeding philosophers (continental philosophers such as<br>
Hegel in particular) attempting to remove God from philosophy, had<br>
merely renamed him in various ways. Hegel of course did this by<br>
replacing God with Ultimate Truth.<br>
