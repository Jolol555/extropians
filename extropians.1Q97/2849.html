Hal FInney and Curt Adams raise a serious question about the viability of the<br>
"trade-in" strategy I suggested, that being the problem of incongruities in<br>
the mapping of nerve connections between the original brain and the<br>
ennervation pattern in the "trade-in" body.  Interestingly, on the same day,<br>
Jeff Allbright points us to an article in Wired about the current state of<br>
the art in brain-computer interfaces.  I wonder whether one part of the<br>
solution to the mapping problem might not lie in further devlopments in that<br>
technology.  Rather than a simple surgical or biochemical procedure of<br>
connecting the neural pathways, perhaps each end of the connection could be<br>
terminated in a "smart junction box", where the mapping process is assisted<br>
with some sort of "external" or at least non-biological aid.  Developing the<br>
new functional connections then might be a cooperative process of the<br>
"trade-in" body, the transplanted brain and some fairly sophisticated<br>
computer device.  Any thoughts on the viability of this approach?<br>
<p>
Also, I wonder what the order of magnitude is that we're talking about here.<br>
 I assume that much of the cranial nerve structure would be carried across<br>
from the "original", e.g. the entire occular system, including the eyes<br>
themselves, would be transplanted, rather than attempting a hook-up to the<br>
"trade-in's" eyes.  This would be more difficult with the nerves that serve<br>
the mouth and tounge, etc, but might not be insurmountable.  If this were<br>
possible, then the connections across the spinal column would then be the<br>
biggest challenge.  How many nerves are we talking about at that juncture?<br>
