Here is what the List of Lists says about us.  <br>
Does it need updating?<br>
The maintainer is arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva).<br>
<p>
    Purpose: Extropians is devoted to the discussion and development<br>
    of Extropian ideas. The term "Extropian" was coined by the publishers<br>
    of the journal "Extropy", which is devoted to Extropian philosophy.<br>
    This list is a spinoff of the journal. Extropians may be roughly<br>
    described as those simultaneously interested in anarchocapitalist<br>
    politics, cryonics (and other life extension techniques), the<br>
    technological extension of human intelligence and perception,<br>
    nanotechnology, spontaneous orders, and a number of other related<br>
    ideas. If you are an Extropian, the concept that these are all<br>
    related topics will seem natural.<br>
<p>
    All Extropians (and those who suspect that they are Extropians)<br>
    are invited to join. The list is run from a commercial site and<br>
    to strictly cover costs there is a fee charged to join the list,<br>
    $14 per year (less for ExI member and Journal subscribers and<br>
    students). A 30 day free-trial is given to all subscribers.<br>
<p>
