Why don't you try running some numbers? I don't have my reference books<br>
handy, but I vaguely recall that the bandwidth of long-term memory<br>
storage for human beings is about 2 bits per second. Don't trust me on<br>
this: I wouldn't be at all surprised if I was off by several orders of<br>
magnitude (it's only my long-term memory I'm consulting, after all).<br>
<p>
But actually, I don't even trust those measurements. The way that<br>
information passes back and forth between human beings in live<br>
conversation, through tone of voice, facial expression, gesture,<br>
word, etc seems very-high-bandwidth to me, and measuring the exact<br>
bandwidth seems like a very difficult project. But my unreliable<br>
introspective observation is that what makes me unique, what makes<br>
me Eric Watt Forste, has a lot more to do with the unique constellation<br>
of information that my brain has ingested since I was born than it<br>
has to do with my genome. Not that I believe in tabula rasa or<br>
anything, but quite some time ago I decided that AIs will probably<br>
have to be raised like children, educated slowly (though we'll<br>
probably be able to make multiple copies of the first few that are<br>
properly educated). I could be wrong about this if they have a<br>
*much* higher input bandwidth than we do, but I still expect that<br>
the first few AIs are going to be quite stupid for the first several<br>
years they are running. Isn't this Lenat's expectation with CYC<br>
(or whatever his current project is)? I don't think you can just<br>
copy a workable system of ethics into someone's head, at least not<br>
with current technology. I think the information content of the<br>
total set of values our culture has evolved to this point is very<br>
high, and memetic replication has nothing like the error-correction<br>
mechanisms that genetic replication has. Communication is difficult,<br>
but we have managed to muddle through so far somehow.<br>
<p>
I do take it that you've read Hofstadter's essay "Waking Up from the<br>
Boolean Dream", have you not? I think it's one of his more important<br>
pieces of writing, especially considering how long ago he wrote it. It's<br>
rather prophetic of much of the work that has been done with genetic<br>
algorithms and artificial neural networks since then.<br>
<p>
Oh, and I'm still not going to participate in your Poll, because you<br>
left out Art again, even after Natasha reminded you.<br>
