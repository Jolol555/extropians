<i>&gt; Libertarian socialism assumes people own their own bodies, unlike</i><br>
<i>&gt; "anarcho-capitalism" where the individual is "owned" by the corporation</i><br>
<i>&gt; they work for. In "anarcho-" capitalist society human behavior is regulated</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the imposition of regulatory patents, copyright laws, and so on.</i><br>
<p>
Copyrights and patents are /not/ a fundamental part of anarcho-capitalist<br>
philosophy, and in fact I find them completely counter to it (though I<br>
have had much difficulty convincing others of that point of view).  The<br>
statement that anarcho-capitalism does not respect self-ownership is<br>
willfully slanderous--you know better, we all know better.  If you want<br>
to to express opposition to an idea, have the integrity to argue with<br>
the real idea as it is, not with your own rhetorical creations.<br>
<p>
The current standard of anarcho-capitalist thought in probably David<br>
Friedman's work.  It is true that he does argue in favor of copyrights<br>
and patents.  I think his analysis is flawed, as was Rand's, but that<br>
doesn't mean you throw out the whole system.  That's like creationists<br>
who argue that Darwin wasn't 100% correct, therefore God created man.<br>
