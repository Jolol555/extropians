As Matthew Sciabarra tried to point out in his excellent recent book, "Ayn<br>
Rand, Russian Radical," such societies as you have referenced will only work<br>
if all major players are "moral" in the sense proposed by Ms. Rand.  As all<br>
persons who have had to serve as legal representatives of others know, pigs<br>
will fly before a majority of people are "moral" in the sense that Ms. Rand<br>
proposed.  Thus, as you point out, such anarcho-capitalist societies as you<br>
have referenced will deginerate into the war of all against all.<br>
