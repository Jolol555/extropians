Dan Fabulich brought up the concern that dogmatic people, working together for <br>
their cause may be more dedicated and more powerful than non-dogmatic, more <br>
tolerant and rational people, such as ourselves.  Dan likes the Extropian <br>
ideas, but he is concerned with how successful they can be, competing against <br>
more dogmatic and irrational belief systems.  Is there any reason to be <br>
optimistic that Reason will finally prevail?  Are the memes which encourage <br>
rationality and non-dogmatism inherently more attractive than those which <br>
encourage the opposite?<br>
<p>
First of all, we have to consider what's so good about rationality and <br>
non-dogmatism in the first place.  Does being rational and non-dogmatic really <br>
help us accomplish our goals?  Well, yes, of course, rationality helps us <br>
accomplish goals; that is the whole point of it.  Acting irrationally is <br>
seldom successful in accomplishing goals.  What about non-dogmatism?  Well, a <br>
dogmatic frame of mind is closed to new ideas, ideas which may be better or <br>
worse than current ones.  If one is open to lots of new ideas, one can test <br>
them out and pick the best among them and thus be more successful at <br>
accomplishing one's goals than if one had relentlessly stuck with poorer <br>
ideas.<br>
<p>
Those who are rational and non-dogmatic think clearly and utilize the best <br>
ideas available to them.  This helps them be more successful at accomplishing <br>
their goals.  Rationality and non-dogmatism are attractive to people, such as <br>
ourselves, because the ideas *work*.  That is the whole *point* of them, and <br>
when we find ideas which work better, we eagerly adopt them.  This committment <br>
to what actually works and willingness to alter one's approach in a continual <br>
search for what works better is what makes rational and non-dogmatic people so <br>
successful in their lives.<br>
<p>
A group of dogmatic people may be very *committed* to their ideas, but if <br>
their ideas are faulty, that will be their downfall.  In the real world, one <br>
must be responsive to reality, and that means being rational and non-dogmatic. <br>
 Those who are more rational and open to new ideas will tend to be much more <br>
successful than those who are less responsive to reality.<br>
<p>
Our ideas our superior because they work.  And they work because that is the <br>
criteria for them to be our ideas.  If they didn't work, we would discard them <br>
in favor of ideas that *do* work, or that at least work better.    We are more <br>
adaptable and nimble than irrational dogmatists.  Our flexible ways of <br>
thinking will ultimately prevail, because their very nature is to find and <br>
utilize the best ideas available.  If others have better strategies than us, <br>
we adopt their strategies and reap that success also.<br>
<p>
As irrational and dogmatic as so many humans are, we all still want and are <br>
attracted to what works, what helps us accomplish our goals.  We are <br>
goal-seeking creatures, and we tend to repeat behavior which has helped <br>
accomplish our goals before, and what doesn't work tends to fall away.  Even <br>
though many doom-sayers say things are getting worse, all the evidence I see <br>
indicates that everything is getting better.  People *are* becoming more <br>
rational and open-minded and are consequently seeing more success in their <br>
lives and setting an example for others to follow.<br>
<p>
Reason will ultimately triumph; it's nature is to succeed.  <br>
