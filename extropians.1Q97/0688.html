Okay.  There's been some discussion lately of whether Extropian Art<br>
should appear on the poll.  My position is that Art belongs with, say:<br>
<p>
*) Reading science fiction.<br>
*) Eating lunch.<br>
*) Going to scientific conferences.<br>
<p>
And not with:<br>
<p>
*) Twiddling with protein synthesis.<br>
*) Trying to one-up Lenat's EURISKO.<br>
*) Building Firefly-oid tools for 'Net societies.<br>
<p>
In other words, Art, even Extropian Art, may be important, or even<br>
necessary, but is not an activity directed at Singularity or populating<br>
the galaxy.  It does not belong on a poll about what ends are most<br>
important and what means we use to get there.<br>
<p>
I apologize to anyone who may have been offended by my lack of artistic<br>
sensitivity.  I have hypothesized that some areas of aesthetic<br>
appreciation were taken out by my Algernonic enhancement, so please bear<br>
with me.<br>
<p>
That being said, if anyone sincerely believes that modern Extropian Art<br>
is an act specifically hastening Omnipotence, Plenitude and Co., or that<br>
some kind of Transcendent Art is a goal worthy of separate mention and<br>
not simply inclusion under Perfect Ethics, and most of all that our<br>
modern Extropian Art is actually a step Power Art (forgive me,<br>
Pournelle!), then I shall revise the Poll appropriately.<br>
<p>
Alternatively, if you think the poll should be about what you actually<br>
do, and should include such items as "peer-reviewed publications",<br>
"science fiction conventions", and "Extropian Art", the poll can be<br>
modified in that direction as well.<br>
<p>
Or, YOU can do it!  I'm not going to shoot you if you make up your own<br>
poll, really!<br>
