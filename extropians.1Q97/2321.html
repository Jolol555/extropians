By way of penance, I really ought to add some content to this message...<br>
Let's see... Yahoo's Technology News section says "NEC Develops World's <br>
First Four-Gigabit DRAM Chip" ("four times the size of a thumb nail...<br>
`It can store the complete works of William Shakespeare 64 times      <br>
over,' NEC vice president Hajime Sasaki told a news conference...<br>
NEC aims to send out sample shipments by 2000")... "Top Stories" says<br>
"Progress Seen Toward Parkinson's Gene Therapy" ("`The exciting part of <br>
this finding is that we know you can put the gene into the right part <br>
of the brain and get GDNF secreted continuously at low levels'..." -<br>
reminiscent of Bruce Sterling's story "Our Neural Chernobyl", where<br>
gene-hackers modify HIV to produce a nerve-growth factor, and<br>
experience an Algernon-like process)... and for _Snow Crash_ fans,<br>
"U.S. Says Drug Smugglers Tried to Buy Sub" ("The owner of a Miami strip <br>
club has been charged with acting as a middleman for Colombia drug gangs <br>
trying to buy a Russian nuclear-powered submarine").<br>
