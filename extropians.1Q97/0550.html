I've been following the Moon warfare thread with some interest. I wonder, <br>
however whether masses of 1 ton missiles at some km/s (11.5-2.x km/s?) <br>
are the optimal weapon system?<br>
<p>
Clearly, the Earth/Moon assymetry in the hypothetical conflict will force <br>
the Earthlings to use thermonuclear charges. Nukes work differently in <br>
spece: there is no atmosphere to transform the shortwave EM radiation <br>
into IR range, also there is no attenuation. If the fireball does not <br>
touch the ground, the EM flash will slag a thin surface layer, which <br>
then can cool off by radiating heat into space. However, localized <br>
surface infrastructure can still be destroyed, especially sensorics and <br>
photovoltaics arrays (moonies can't live in permanent mole mode). If we use <br>
depth-penetrating nukes the result would be a shockwave, which might <br>
cause near-surface habitats to breach and thus to decompress. Of course <br>
this is not a problem for deeply buried habitats, but they must come out <br>
from there, sometime. If the nukes are dirty/high flux ones, surface <br>
activation might become a problem, but not for machines and very well <br>
protected humans.<br>
<p>
So the idea would be to intercept incoming warheads on their ballistic (if <br>
they are smart, their sensorics is susceptible to damage, and the exhaust <br>
is visible) course. The sensible thing to use would be a particle weapon, <br>
or a laser. Laser is difficult, since warhead reflexive coating will make it <br>
difficult to absorb energy (which will be diluted by focusing/tracking <br>
trouble), but particle beams are different. Trouble is, a focused <br>
charged beam will expand in space, so a neutral high-speed beam <br>
would be much more efficient (basically, this is just a gigantic <br>
groundbased ion/plasma drive, which is currently used to propel some probes <br>
and to keep satellites in their orbits, counteracting deccelerating <br>
effect by atmospheric drag, which is a function of solar activity, btw). <br>
Even better would be an  antiparticle/antimatter beam, since energy <br>
released upon impact won't come from kinetic energy invested by the <br>
accelerator. (Another thing would be Moon rings made from brilliant <br>
pebbles (check out Stanislaw Lem's "Fiasko", also "Peace upon Earth"). <br>
Whatever happened to them (apart from the TWA desaster, that is), btw?)<br>
<p>
Tipler speaks about antihydrogen production for the Forward rocket, but I <br>
found his cost discussion far from being convincing. Current production <br>
processes seem to be of very small yield (he speculates about developing <br>
better ones, which SSC might have done), and current storage is possible in <br>
particle traps solely. If we are talking of g or kg of antimatter for <br>
energy conserve than these issues will much more relevant. I've thought <br>
about storing a microscoping needle of, say, antiiron magnetically <br>
suspended in a cryogenic chamber with very hard vacuum, but it seems very <br>
problematic due to the secondary-electron-multiplier kind of effect (boom).<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. the machine is molasses slow, I'd better stop. One thing: in "Flying <br>
Buttresses, Entropy, and O-Rings" James L. Adams speaks about a 3 sec <br>
delay for the autofeedback coordination loop for Moon telepresence, which <br>
is a strong no-no for teleperating Moon factories. So it better be <br>
von-Neumann probe, after all.<br>
