<i>&gt;&gt; While I agree with you in general, the medical establishment in the US</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is clealy more obviously interested in self-protection than science.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you could show me some responsible valid double-blind studies</i><br>
<i>&gt;that show the effectiveness of chiropractic, massage, accupuncture,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or herbal medicine (apart from those herbs used to manufacture known</i><br>
<i>&gt;drugs like ephedrine), then there would not be a single doctor in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "establishment" that would "suppress" them.  </i><br>
<p>
1. Do you think that only those herbs which are already AMA-aprroved<br>
work?<br>
<p>
2. If herbs cannot be patented, why would a company spend the<br>
neccessary millions of dollars to do the FDA-approved tests?  They<br>
would be throwing money down the toilet.<br>
<p>
3. By extention, it is not in the medical establishment's best<br>
interest to discover the efficacy of therepies which are not<br>
controlled through their monopoly.<br>
<p>
4. A recent study by, I believe, the NIH showed that chiroproactic has<br>
a better success rate at treating lower back pain than AMA medicine. <br>
<p>
4. Do you know how much time in medical school is spent on<br>
preventative medicine and nutrition?  I've had med students tell me<br>
that they got one (1) day of training in nutrition.  Do you think that<br>
this is appropriate, given what you know about nutrition and life<br>
extention?  If not, why do you think that this is the only case of the<br>
medical establishment missing the boat?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;medicine" is just a euphemism for unproven medicine.  Responsible</i><br>
<i>&gt;doctors have no choice but to disapprove.  If they recommended such</i><br>
<i>&gt;therapies without proof, they would be risking their patients' lives</i><br>
<i>&gt;on nothing more substantial than anecdotes and mystical nonsense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They would be culpaple murderers.  Homeopaths, herbalists, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;chiropractors who treat, say, cancer patients and advise them against</i><br>
<i>&gt;proven therapies like chemotherapy and radiation are responsible for</i><br>
<i>&gt;thousands of deaths no less than if they had pulled a trigger.  </i><br>
<p>
I agree that there are many quacks in "alternative medicine".  Perhaps<br>
the majority of practitioners are quacks.  This does not mean that all<br>
alternative medicine is quackery.<br>
<p>
It's interesting that the pharmaceutical companies are out combing<br>
through the traditional medicines of tribes o' the rainforest to<br>
patent, while dismissing the idea that any plant that grows in North<br>
America or Europe is of any medical use.  Please explain to me how<br>
this can be so.<br>
<p>
Look: AMA medicine is damn near miraculous at what it's good at:<br>
treating acute conditions such as someone's heart stopping, or their<br>
arm getting lopped off.  It's crummy at treating more subtle problems,<br>
such as my lower back pain.  I use what's appropriate and what works.<br>
I understand the placebo effect, and I assure you that accupuncture<br>
works.  I would not go to my chiropractor for cancer.  I would not<br>
have a surgeon put metal rods in my back for back pain.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;but for a professional</i><br>
<i>&gt;to actually recommend them on faith is at best willful fraud.</i><br>
<p>
The absense of double-blind studies does not mean "faith".  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The old canards about supression of alternatives to bolster the</i><br>
<i>&gt;finances of the establishment is hollow rhetoric spouted by these</i><br>
<i>&gt;charlatans because they can't talk about proof.  </i><br>
<p>
Right.  Monopolies are evil, except for the AMA's, since its<br>
intentions are altruistic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Open your eyes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;the plain facts are that 20 years ago, leukemia and breast cancer</i><br>
<i>&gt;were death sentences.  Now, most survive.  This didn't happen</i><br>
<i>&gt;because of herbalists; it happened because of radiation and chemo,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and because doctors held themselves to the standards of /science/,</i><br>
<i>&gt;not the new-age hippy feelgood bullshit of the popular press.</i><br>
<p>
Again, I agree that modern medicine is best for this sort of problem.<br>
I disagree that this means that it's best for *every* sort of<br>
problem. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I sound harsh, it is with reason.  I cannot stand idly by and</i><br>
<i>&gt;allow the genocide of gullible sick people by snake-oil salesmen</i><br>
<i>&gt;without expressing my moral revulsion.  I love life, and my moral</i><br>
<i>&gt;standards spring from that love of life, and I revile those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;would destroy it.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you, Ayn.  <br>
<p>
If you can find an MD that can treat my back problems better than my<br>
chiropractor and rolfer (who, I might add, were recommended to me by<br>
my MD), I'll go to him/her.<br>
