I stumbled into the AOL "current events" area and discovered that the service<br>
was conducting a member poll on attitudes toward human cloning.  The<br>
following was the tally of votes as of early this morning:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Out of  10012 total responses:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  5599 people (56%) picked: Ban it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  2086 people (21%) picked: Don't ban it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  2326 people (23%) picked: For medical research only.</i><br>
<p>
I then visited the associated message board.  Of the just under 300 messages,<br>
it seemed that a significantly higher proportion or posters were willing to<br>
entertain the idea of tinkering with human genetic material, including quite<br>
a few who expressed very extropian values.  Those expressing fears about<br>
cloning exhibited an abysmal scientific ignorance of the process and seemed<br>
most concerned with the question of whether a human clone would have a soul.<br>
 Opposition to human cloning appeared to be primarily based on some<br>
conception of "god's will."<br>
<p>
I find all of this to be an interesting expression of public opinion, even if<br>
it isn't very rigorous.  Presumably the initial survey population represents<br>
mildly technophilic people (compared with the general U.S. populace), with a<br>
slightly higher than average interest in public affairs, since participants<br>
are self-selected in an online service.  In this group, an overwhelming<br>
majority (79%) favors government regulation of scientific research and<br>
technology development.  A solid majority (56%) favors an outright, total<br>
government ban on human cloning.  (In this connection, I spotted a newswire<br>
story that the British government has moved to cut all funding for the<br>
original sheep research . . . perhaps another argument in favor of Scottish<br>
independence . . .)  However, of those willing to take a little extra time to<br>
express themselves, a more free and courageous attitude is much more<br>
prevalent.<br>
<p>
Reviewing this material once again brought home to me how careful we have to<br>
be to always remember that the vast majority of humanity, even in "advanced"<br>
societies, is deeply ignorant of science and bases their most profound moral<br>
and political views on simple superstition and inarticulate fears.  Brace<br>
yourselves!<br>
