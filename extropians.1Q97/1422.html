Sorry, guess I should have put in some references.  The ideas I mentioned<br>
have been widely researched to within an inch of their lives.  A book I've<br>
listed previously, still interesting (replete with additional technical<br>
refs), is:<br>
<p>
Robert Pool, THE NEW SEXUAL REVOLUTION (1993)<br>
<p>
Avowedly even-handed, Pool lets his own guard down in a revealing slip.  The<br>
female spotted hyena, he remarks, `sports a penis.  Well, it's not literally<br>
a penis - it's merely a clitoris so enlarged that it looks like a penis'.<br>
*Merely* a clitoris...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, you DID leave out the possibility that such genius ISN'T sex-</i><br>
<i>&gt;linked.</i><br>
<p>
As Lyle and others have shown, this is *not* a possibility, in our culture<br>
(and every other culture known to ethnographers).  It's just an observable<br>
fact.  Of course, what's at issue is *why* it's a fact.  Lactating breasts<br>
are pretty much sex-linked, but only marginally because of social practices.<br>
Penis size is almost entirely sex linked - that's traditionally part of the<br>
job description.  But deeper than such markers are the associated genes,<br>
whose impact is far more complex and far-reaching.  Pool provides copious<br>
references to developmental oddities attendant upon (I'm paraphrasing this<br>
because I want people to do their own homework, and I can't be bothered<br>
searching the book which lacks an index, goddamn it) XY children who grow up<br>
to be perfect little girls because they lack the gene for using the<br>
testosterone they dutifully produce.  There's also the paradigm case of the<br>
boy baby who had his penis sliced off by the rabbi or doctor and was raised<br>
as a girl after his balls were lopped for the sake of neatness.  Nobody told<br>
her [or so I gather; this is a key detail, of course] of her sorry history.<br>
She was discussed for years in the literature as proof positive of<br>
socialised gender formation.  At adolescence, she went to the surgeon and<br>
had a penis rebuilt so he could get on with his life.  This is taken as<br>
strong evidence that his brain had been seriously androgenised in utero.<br>
