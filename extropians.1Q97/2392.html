Quoth J. de Lyser:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Problem is that six year old could very well be the next einstein, but we</i><br>
<i>&gt;will never know in a system you advocate.</i><br>
<p>
The best way to suppress genius is social democratic schools. E.g. we don't<br>
get grades the first six years of school, and the idea of special schools or<br>
classes for the smart is unthinkable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I agree with you that our current state education doesn't work, and indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt;is indoctrinated, by all posible ideas the state advocates, not just</i><br>
<i>&gt;stimulating socialism, but nationalism, far beyond what is needed for</i><br>
national &gt;identity. <br>
<p>
Not to mention feminism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My personal ethics on this:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you worked for your (loads of) money yourself, you have all rights to</i><br>
<i>&gt;enjoy its benefits, as you have proven to be an invaluable exponent of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;society. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If however you are a stupid f*ck, who has never worked one day in his life,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but has rich parents, or fell onto some money some other way than by</i><br>
<i>&gt;his/her own ingenuity. Please get in line with the rest and run the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;risk of dying in the process of doing so. </i><br>
<p>
You have to be a legitimate child of the social democracy to even think of<br>
asking if a person "deserves" what he is given by his parents or others or<br>
otherwise rightfully acquires, or what value he is to society. Also, my<br>
parents might very well have worked for their money and your not letting<br>
them give them to me to me is a serious constraint of *their* freedom.<br>
This is even worse than imposing that the state must inherit everything<br>
when one dies; at least then you could possibly give it away first.<br>
<p>
You want socialized medicine and you call yourself an extropian? The FAQ<br>
says something about that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The national budget has a surplus of many billions because of the oil, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;these are being saved to ensure pensions in the future. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's what you think, they'll increasingly go to Europe, unless your state</i><br>
<i>&gt;wants to get completely isolated economically that is. If your state is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;save any of that money for its people: Distribute it now over all your</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizens... Or better still: INVEST it in infrascructure, less you become</i><br>
<i>&gt;the perifery of Europe. (tunnel ?)</i><br>
<p>
I'm glad we didn't join the EU. I don't want to subsidize welfare in the rest<br>
of Europe also. Maybe when Norway is poorer than Europe on average I will<br>
change my mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I will emigrate to the US ASAP. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why ? Looks to me you'd be far happier in any ex-communist country.</i><br>
<p>
I like it in the US. Politics is just one of the reasons.<br>
