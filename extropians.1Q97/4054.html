Apparent Mass Suicide Victims Cloaked in Shrouds<br>
<p>
RANCHO SANTA FE, California (Reuter) - The bodies of 39 men and women, <br>
cloaked in purple shrouds, were found in a million<br>
dollar California mansion Wednesday in what police said appeared to be a <br>
mass suicide. <br>
<p>
Commander Alan Fulmer of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said <br>
at a news conference in the early hours of Thursday that<br>
the cause of death remained a mystery, but ruled out gas poisoning. <br>
<p>
"There were no gas fumes in the house. The only smell coming out of that <br>
house was that of dead bodies," he said. <br>
<p>
Fulmer said he believed the 39 people, including an undetermined number <br>
of women, took their own lives in a strange ritual that left<br>
them appearing as though they had died peacefully in their sleep. "My <br>
supposition at this point is that it was a mass suicide," he said. <br>
<p>
Fulmer added that all the victims were cloaked in purple, triangular <br>
shaped shrouds covering their faces and chests. <br>
<p>
He said that the previous description of the victims as all males between <br>
the ages of 18 and 24 was incorrect. "There were some<br>
women among the victims and some of the victims were over the age of 24," <br>
Fulmer added, explaining that sheriff's deputies did not<br>
examine the bodies on entering the house. <br>
<p>
Fulmer also said the victims were found lying on mattresses or cots with <br>
their hands at their sides as if they had fallen asleep. But no<br>
suicide notes were found and there were no signs of physicial injury to <br>
the victims, adding to the mystery surrounding their deaths. <br>
<p>
Some 30 detectives and crime laboratory technicians from the San Diego <br>
Sheriff's Department were working on the case, Fulmer said,<br>
and experts from the Los Angeles Coroner's Office would be joining that <br>
team later Thursday. <br>
<p>
In addition, Fulmer added, San Diego detectives had been in touch with <br>
the Beverly Hills Police Department, but he declined to say<br>
why. <br>
<p>
According to broadcast reports, the dead belonged to a religious group <br>
that designed computer web pages. But Fulmer refused to<br>
speculate on whether the victims belonged to a religious cult. <br>
<p>
Local TV stations quoted Milton Silverman, a lawyer for the owner of the <br>
house as saying it had been rented to a religious computer<br>
group called "WWW Higher Source". WWW stands for World Wide Web, a major <br>
computer Internet source. <br>
<p>
Silverman said the group was led by a man called "Father John" and that <br>
its members, who did not drink alcohol or smoke and were<br>
celibate, were sent to Middle America as "angels." <br>
<p>
Real estate agent Scott Warren, who said he showed the house recently, <br>
described to ABC's "Nightline" a "bizarre" scene in which the<br>
occupants considered the residence a "temple." <br>
<p>
Deputies were alerted to a problem at the $1.6 million mansion in the <br>
exclusive San Diego suburb of Rancho Santa Fe by an<br>
anonymous caller who asked police to check on the residents. <br>
<p>
In addition to the shrouds, the victims all wore black trousers and black <br>
tennis shoes. <br>
<p>
Hours after police first arrived, investigators had little information <br>
about the group. <br>
<p>
"We have no idea of their identities or where they come from," Fulmer <br>
said. "We don't know if they belonged to any religious cult or<br>
group or anything like that." <br>
<p>
News of the apparent suicides quickly spread through the affluent <br>
neighborhood, shocking local residents. A neighbor, Bill Strong, told<br>
reporters the mansion was owned by a man named Sam Koutchesahani, who had <br>
rented it to people "from out of state" in October. <br>
<p>
He said the people who lived in the house were "middle-aged, men and <br>
women." The mansion is surrounded by a brick wall in a<br>
community of palatial estates known as the "Beverly Hills of San Diego" <br>
some 20 miles north of San Diego. <br>
<p>
Police said there was no indication the deaths were related to an <br>
incident in Quebec last Saturday, when five members of a doomsday<br>
cult -- the Solar Temple -- died in a blazing house in an apparent ritual <br>
suicide pact. In 1994 and 1995, 69 members of the Solar<br>
Temple cult died in fires in Canada and Switzerland. <br>
