<i>&gt; &gt;I stumbled into the AOL "current events" area and discovered that the service</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;was conducting a member poll on attitudes toward human cloning.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;following was the tally of votes as of early this morning:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;  Out of  10012 total responses:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;  5599 people (56%) picked: Ban it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;  2086 people (21%) picked: Don't ban it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;  2326 people (23%) picked: For medical research only.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe a major TV show (Nightline?) did a poll of the more general</i><br>
<i>&gt; public, and found something like 90% for banning human cloning.</i><br>
<p>
I'd bet a week's pay that these polls make no attempt to ensure<br>
that the pollees have any idea what cloning actually /is/.  If<br>
one actually took the time to explain the details, and then took<br>
a poll among those who knew the facts, I'm sure the result would<br>
be quite different.<br>
<p>
Indeed, a medical case a couple of years ago came up where a child<br>
needed a bone marrow transplant, so his parents went so far as to<br>
reverse a vasectomy, have a new child, and give their older child<br>
a bone marrow transplant from the new one.  Their chance of the new<br>
child being a match wasn't very good; if the new child had been a<br>
clone, it would have been 100%.  There were certainly those who<br>
objected to what these parents were doing, but most were supportive.<br>
If this situation arises again, and the parents want to have their<br>
new child be the older child's twin, I think the public would be<br>
generally supportive of that as well--and would still be against<br>
"cloning" if you asked, because they don't know what they're saying.<br>
