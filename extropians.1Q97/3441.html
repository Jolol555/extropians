My compliments to Natasha, as opposed to E. Russell, for her calmness in<br>
this debate.  But I'm afraid that here I have to agree with a literal<br>
reading of Carwash: "making the extropians concepts ... LOOK like<br>
scifi."  Nanotech may not be scifi, but associating it with posters<br>
showing people with skin of pure silicon may well cause people to think<br>
of nanotech as pulp scifi.  Johnny Carwash being an existence, although<br>
not a frequency, proof.<br>
<p>
Why would you want a silicon, or silicon-compound, skin anyway?  If you<br>
have that kind of tech, and want semiconductors in your skin, use<br>
diamond circuitry.  Much more useful would be diamondoid plates.  Or<br>
perhaps buckyhair.  How does buckyfiber rate on the Kevlar scale?  For<br>
more decoration, artificial quartzes, corundum, or diamond, with<br>
impurities in some particular pattern.<br>
