You must be talking about some alternate universe where we're still <br>
stuck in the first half of this century!<br>
<p>
&lt;Extropy appears to have a faith in evolution and boundless <br>
expansion-a constant increase in extropy created by life wading <br>
upstream against the "inevitable" heat death of the universe due to <br>
the laws of thermodynamics.&gt;<br>
<p>
Not faith. The evidence, at least on this earth, is toward increasing <br>
complexity and organization (but not necessarily socialistic). <br>
 Big-Bang / Big-Crunch thinking is still the consensus, but still <br>
*just* a theory. One of the latest trends is the biophilia <br>
hypothesis.<br>
<p>
&lt;Why, then, do we see the flourishing of socialism?&gt;<br>
<p>
Where?! Most of the news reports I see talk about the dismantling of <br>
socialism.<br>
<p>
&lt;If I were to accept this answer, one would have to tell me why it is <br>
that Japan, being one of the more socialistic of the industrialized <br>
nations, is so extropic- by this I mean they are way ahead of the rest <br>
of the world in longevity(mostly because their cuisine is naturally <br>
high nutrient/low calorie) and they produce new technology at a rate <br>
much higher than the rest of the world.&gt;<br>
<p>
What does diet have to do with socialism?  Where is this time machine <br>
you seem to have discovered? Japan is currently suffering a recession <br>
and systemic breakdown - banks are collapsing like houses of cards - <br>
and I recall a number of high-tech, government-directed Japanese <br>
projects, in AI and high-definition television for example, that were <br>
supposed to swamp the rest of the world, yet never quite flew from the <br>
hive...<br>
