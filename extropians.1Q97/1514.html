In a message dated 97-01-28 03:09:00 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
<i> &gt; If she did math well, she would still have that power...  </i><br>
 <br>
 She already did math well, on an elementary level. <br>
<p>
uh huh<br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;But that's not <br>
 what it means to be a mathematician.  What if she were as obsessed <br>
 with math as you are with art?  She would have to reorganize her mind <br>
 at a very fundamental level, and it would change her feminine psyche <br>
 into something else.   &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
What made you say that? <br>
QM<br>
<p>
PS<br>
FYI, I am not obsessed with anything. Oh yes, I am very good at my art, but<br>
it has not lessened  my feminity or sensuality, in fact perhaps it enhances<br>
both....<br>
