<p>
When the first PC's where made you couldn't go into a store and buy one.<br>
You couldn't even imagine what it was going to be used for. Spreedsheets<br>
didn't exist so you couldn't use them. Wordprocessors didn't exist either<br>
etc. etc. (i'm making an oversimplification here) So therefore there wasn't<br>
any market for it. You didn't know you had the need.<br>
<p>
When they hit the market the use for the technology gradually grew and<br>
hence the market grew. <br>
<p>
When the Mac was introduced there was no market for a Graphical inteface on<br>
computers and the same thing happened when it hit the market. It created a<br>
new niche.<br>
