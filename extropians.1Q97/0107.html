I wrote a brief description of the type of schools I want to get involved in <br>
creating, and Michael Lorrey asked, "Where do I sign up?"  I wish I could tell <br>
you, Mike, but I haven't got everyone together yet to do it.  This will take <br>
some time.  I need to find people who want to do this and we need to get <br>
together and actually do it.  I will begin attending the Reed College (in <br>
Portland, Oregon) this fall, and I am sure I will discuss my ideas for this <br>
project with many of my fellow students and probably find many who want to <br>
work with me on this.  I am also planning on writing a few books and some <br>
stuff for the Web describing what I'm wanting to do.  Hopefully, this will <br>
inspire others to do similar things, and hopefully I will get many contacts <br>
from people who are eager to work with me on this.<br>
<p>
Most likely, the school will start out small, perhaps a few of us, doing <br>
workshops on various things, teaching people different skills.  Perhaps some <br>
Creativity Workshops, to teach people how to loosen up and learn how to play <br>
with things and create things with various materials and find novel solutions <br>
to problems.  Perhaps some Problem Solving Workshops where people are taught <br>
general strategies for solving problems of all different types and where they <br>
are given all sorts of problems to solve during the workshop, from engineering <br>
problems to logic and math problems, to artistic problems, to philisophical <br>
problems, etc.  As the various workshops and classes become more popular, the <br>
school will grow, as new faculty and students join.<br>
<p>
There's a lot of details I'm leaving out here -- those will have to wait for <br>
my book, but the schools I'm thinking of will be considerably different than <br>
the typical school.  They'll be much more focused on mind training and <br>
personal development than most schools are.  The emphasis will be on learning <br>
as much as possible and developing a very wide range of knowledge and skills.  <br>
There will be a great emphasis on developing great artistic, technological and <br>
scientific skill.  I intend for the schools to be places of great scientific <br>
discovery, technological innovation and cultural expression; a very <br>
Renaissance type of school.<br>
