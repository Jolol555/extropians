We've had push media for a long time. It's called television. The media<br>
conspiring to eliminate interactivity is not good. The media sees (with some<br>
exception) the internet as a slow expensive television. Do we want that? I<br>
think Pointcast is a pain in the ass, and I thought it was several months<br>
ago when it first appeared (not when I saw it in Wired). If I want to get<br>
news, I'll get the news I want when I want it. Pointcast is an overrated<br>
screen saver.<br>
