John Clark said, "I think it's one of the great tragedies of History that the <br>
rarest, most valuable quality that existed in the world was not used to full <br>
advantage. Think what Newton could have accomplished if his mind had not been <br>
caught in a infinite loop..."<br>
<p>
This same valuable quality of genius exists in all minds, and rarely, if ever, <br>
is it used to it's full advantage.  Billions of people, all operating *far* <br>
below their potential.  This is no surprise, considering our society has not <br>
organized itself to encourage and assist the development of genius in people.  <br>
Newton, as smart as he was, was probably an idiot compared to the potential of <br>
the typical human.  That the potential of billions of humans remains scarcely <br>
tapped is the greatest tragedy of all time.  This is the source of nearly all <br>
of our problems. <br>
<p>
One of my main plans for my life is to get together with a bunch of other <br>
like-minded people and start a school whose main purpose is to train each <br>
other and other people to be super-intelligent and highly productive.  The <br>
school will be very focused on teaching students how to develop a strong <br>
personal discipline, so that they become autonomous and very effective <br>
learners.  The school will have a tremendous number of tools and resourses for <br>
students to use, to create things and thus learn from experience, and as they <br>
improve their skill at making things, they can begin selling what they make <br>
and working with teams of other students to sell what they make and have their <br>
own businesses, so that they can continue paying for their schooling, so it is <br>
self-sustaining.  Creating and running one's own business would be part of the <br>
school and part of a much larger, life-long education.<br>
<p>
I don't like the model of going to school for a few years then going out into <br>
the "real world".  I think it would be much safer and more productive to do <br>
both simultaneously; to always be in school and always be doing productive <br>
work, as part of one's education.  A student will be learning a great deal <br>
from running their own business, and they will also be developing other skills <br>
and areas of knowledge outside of that, which they can eventually use for more <br>
ambitious and challenging business ventures.<br>
<p>
Grades and degrees are meaningless in this type of school since each student <br>
is responsible for acheiving the results they want, and they will be receiving <br>
constant feedback on how well they are doing.  One doesn't need a degree to <br>
"get a good job", since the point is to become a free agent and create one's <br>
own business.  <br>
<p>
Of course, this type of school won't work for everyone (not yet anyway), since <br>
it requires a high level of self-discipline, but there are many people for <br>
whom it will work , such as myself.  And, if I am right and very highly <br>
productive and innovative people come out of these schools, more and more <br>
people will be attracted to them or want to send their children to them.<br>
<p>
I believe it's possible for most people to become highly skilled in many <br>
different areas, to become an Ace of All Trades.  I want to work with others <br>
to create schools which train people to do this.<br>
<p>
Imagine the power of billions of human minds unleashed.  That is the vision <br>
that drives me on.<br>
