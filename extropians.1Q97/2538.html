<p>
<p>
I agree that the Turing Test is not a theory of intelligence but it is a sure<br>
fire test for it, if somebody acts intelligently then they are certainly<br>
intelligent. There could be debate over whether a given act, such as writing<br>
a post, is intelligent or not, in fact it's one of the main topics of this<br>
list, but once you grant that an act is intelligent then the thing doing that<br>
intelligent act must be intelligent, end of story.<br>
<p>
Things are not quite as clear cut as far as consciousness is concerned, but<br>
I still think The Turing Test is a good, but not perfect, test for <br>
consciousness. Evolution is concerned only with our external actions, with<br>
our intelligence, not with out consciousness, however important it may be<br>
to us. If you could have intelligence without consciousness then I don't see<br>
why Evolution would have ever bothered to give us consciousness in the first<br>
place.<br>
<p>
Certainly in daily life ever one of us assumes that The Turing Test works<br>
for consciousness, nobody this side of a loony bin really thinks they are<br>
the only conscious being in the Universe, but I grant you that it has never<br>
been proven to be false.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The Turing Test was proposed in the days of behaviorism. It may be </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the best we can do for now, but eventually we'll have a convincing </i><br>
<i>        &gt;theory of intelligence and awareness. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Someday we will have one excellent theory of intelligence, but as for <br>
consciousness, well..., we'll have lots of them.  I don't see how it would<br>
ever be possible to prove that one of those many theories was right and the<br>
others were wrong, because the only consciousness you could experiment on<br>
is the only one you know for sure to exist, your own, and that's not enough.<br>
<p>
Perhaps only a mind that is exactly like mine can be conscious, other minds<br>
may be intelligent but have no more internal feelings than a rock. In my<br>
heart I'm convinced that is not true and I'm convinced that you can't have<br>
intelligence without consciousness, but I'll never be able to prove it.<br>
