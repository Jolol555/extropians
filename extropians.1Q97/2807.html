<i>&gt; I manufacture 99% of the worlds widgets, you make 1% .  I want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; drive you out of business, so I figure I'll lower my price until you</i><br>
<i>&gt; go broke and then I can jack them up to anything I want. So now you</i><br>
<i>&gt; louse money on each widget you sell, the trouble is I do too. I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; 99 times as much money as you do, but I'm lousing it 99 times</i><br>
<i>&gt; faster. Even worse, because the price is very low the demand for</i><br>
<i>&gt; widgets is huge, and if prices are to remain low I must build more</i><br>
<i>&gt; factories and increase production. I'm lousing money faster and</i><br>
<i>&gt; faster, meanwhile you just temporally halt production in your small</i><br>
<i>&gt; factory and wait for me to go broke. It won't be a long wait.       </i><br>
<p>
Let's try another scenario.  I manufacture x% of the world's widgets,<br>
and you manufacture y% (the numbers are irrelevant).  Your widget is<br>
better.  It is better designed, more reliable, and manufactured with<br>
fewer defects.  In addition, thanks to your company's superior<br>
management and manufacturing capability, your widget is produced at<br>
lower cost which allows you to price it more competively than mine. <br>
Your market share is growing while mine is shrinking.  In a perfect<br>
world in which no one would ever play dirty, you would win dominance<br>
in the widget market and I would be forced to either perform better<br>
or find some other niche.  But I have another option.  You are a<br>
successful but still small start up with only a single product on<br>
which you are completely dependent.  I am a giant corporation with<br>
hundreds of profitable products and vast resources.  I could give<br>
widgets away free of charge for years without any significant<br>
suffering.  So I capture the widget market the same way I captured<br>
some of the others.  I lower my prices to levels you can't compete<br>
with, and I increase my marketing efforts to levels that you can't<br>
afford. Soon, I have most of the market share and you are out of <br>
business. I return my pricing to profitable levels and scale back the<br>
marketing and ride on my already established name recognition.  The<br>
coming years of dominating the widget market will easily compensate<br>
for my losses while driving you out of business.  I, with my<br>
inferior product, inferior management, and inefficient production,<br>
have won.  <br>
<p>
This is survival of the richest.  Not survival of the fittest.<br>
<p>
The standard Libertarian (and Republican) belief is that free market<br>
economies inherently favor the smartest, hardest working<br>
entrepreneurs and best products.  This is true.  But they also hold<br>
a belief that this principle causes free market economies to be<br>
inherently stable and fair.  This is not true.  There are other<br>
forces than can operate within such an economy that can defeat the<br>
built-in self-correcting mechanisms. When you begin with a scenario<br>
in which wealth is distributed fairly evenly, then a free market<br>
economy will work very well and will result in high productivity,<br>
with clear benefits for those who produce and denial of those<br>
benefits for those who do not. This is the kind of thriving middle<br>
class economy that the U.S. has benefitted from for many decades. But<br>
as such an economy becomes increasingly polarized (meaning a smaller<br>
part of the population controlling a greater part of the wealth,<br>
shrinking middle class, etc.) a free market economy will begin to<br>
self destruct if it does not have some external compensating force. <br>
Those who control great wealth can win even when market dynamics<br>
should have made it otherwise.  Likewise, those who control little<br>
wealth will often not see rewards that reflect their level of<br>
prodictivity, thus diminishing the incentive to be productive.<br>
<p>
There is capitalism the economic principle, which has both benefits<br>
and problems.  Then there is capitalism the religious belief which,<br>
according to it's proponents, is self-correcting and will always <br>
result in optimization if left entirely to it's own devices.  I find <br>
it strange that Extropians with their affinity for reason and <br>
distaste for irrational belief would exhibit so much more faith than <br>
reason when it comes to economics.  It is for this reason that I <br>
cannot consider myself an Extropian even though I share their sense <br>
of optimism and agree with nearly all of their transhumanistic goals.<br>
<p>
Capitalism is good, but it is not perfect.  We can address the<br>
imperfections and create an economy that works, or we can deny the<br>
imperfections and create one that does not.<br>
<p>
Don't get too enamoured with labels.  Not everything that falls under<br>
the definition of "capitalism" is good.  Not everything that falls<br>
under the definition of "socialism" is bad.  The first can generates<br>
high productivity but is unstable.  The second can create stability<br>
but kills productivity.  Neither system works well in it's purest<br>
form.  Any realistic solution will either involve elements of both,<br>
or will be something so completely different that it bears little<br>
resemblence to either. <br>
<p>
Consider that with the potential offered by automation,<br>
self-replicating machines, nanotechnology, quantum computers,<br>
transhumans/posthumans, exploitation of off-planet resources etc.,<br>
the ability to supply products and services will likely become<br>
vastly greater than it is now.  Both capitalism and socialism are<br>
attempts to address scarcity.  Neither can adequately deal with a<br>
world of plenty.  This inadequacy is already apparent even with<br>
existing production capabilities.  With the automation technology<br>
that is available today, standards of living should be much higher<br>
than what they are.  But existing economic systems cannot adequately<br>
deal with these newly acquired abilities.<br>
