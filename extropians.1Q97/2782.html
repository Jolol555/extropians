&lt;&lt; You are making a category error to compare trade with "other things" in<br>
 life.  It is not competing with those "other" things; it is not in the<br>
 same category.  Trade is a principle of human interaction, not a value<br>
 in itself.  You can't compare them on the same scale any more than one<br>
 can compare weight and length with "benevolence".  It's like I was<br>
 discussing what kind of music I like, and someone says "Yeah, Bach is<br>
 OK, but what about Fettucine Alfredo?"  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
No way, Marinara is much better thatn either! ; P<br>
Re: twas but a reply  to *your* comparison of an act of trade to all<br>
otheracts of beauty, and BTW,  it seemed you thought it  WAS of high value in<br>
itself (which I would have to agree with BTW) and the highest moral value you<br>
knew of..."No value better than the dollar." Either you are backtracking or I<br>
am sorry if I misunderstood. <br>
