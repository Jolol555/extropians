As I understand it, the core of creativity seems to be randomness, the <br>
ability to take something unrelated and combine it with the problem at <br>
hand, unfolding its consequences and potential, and then more or less <br>
rationally evaluate it. The random part might quite well be due to <br>
misfirings and micro-hallucinations (which occur all the time), but most <br>
work is done in the later stages.<br>
<p>
Too much random combinations, and you get the classic psychedelic problem <br>
of thinking you understand the Meaning of Life but all you can write is <br>
"Flossing is important", too much analysis, and you strangle your <br>
creativity with self-criticism. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should we simulate the</i><br>

<p>
Might be worth trying. One could imagine an AI with a "randomness" level <br>
it could adjust...<br>

<p>
Well, I have found engineers to be more creative than most people. I <br>
think it is thanks to their analytical abilities, rather than despite them.<br>
