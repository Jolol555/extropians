<i>&gt; &gt; [H]ow to choose these . . . .?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They obviously have to be reachable and in some sense natural.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds like we need some Schelling points!  In other words, to explicate this</i><br>
<i>&gt; game theory concept to the uninitiated, we need cooridination devices that</i><br>
<i>&gt; independent agents will choose without prior consultation.  An example of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schelling point:  If your friend told you to meet her in Paris, but did not</i><br>
<i>&gt; say where, you would probably head for the Eiffel tower.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I take Greg to suggest we avoid the need for Schelling points by choosing</i><br>
<i>&gt; meeting cooridinates beforehand--a great strategy so far as it goes, but one</i><br>
<i>&gt; that for obvious reasons might not work for all of the human diaspora.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Anders suggested Schelling points based on the sun's relation to the galatic</i><br>
<i>&gt; core.  Using the Earth to derive a Schelling point seems pretty reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt; for humans--but only if they remember their origins!  So here, too, we might</i><br>
<i>&gt; still face a cooridination problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So I'm led to ask:  Were you an intelligence wandering free and lonely in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; galaxy, where would you head to meet others?  What, in other words,</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitutes a universal Schelling point?</i><br>
<p>
Pulsars each have their own frequency, so each is unique.<br>
<p>
ALso: A convention center orbiting the Cygnus X binary system.<br>
<p>
A more nearterm convention spot: Copernicus Crater, 2006, as was<br>
previously discussed on the &gt;H list last year....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I offer a tentative answer:  The point where gravitational forces of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe sum to zero--galatic center, if you will.</i><br>
<p>
Since the universe is theoretically circular, i.e. if you travel in a<br>
straight line you eventually return to where you started, then our<br>
universal "center" is right here, which would also fit, since its all<br>
relative anyways, a convention of trans and post humans would be at the<br>
center of their diaspora, Earth.<br>
<p>
Now considering that inside a black hole, the gravitational forces are<br>
so great that the gravity of the rest of the universe is infinitesimally<br>
small, that couls also be the closest thing to a "center" of the<br>
universe, even though the inside is supposedly no longer part of this<br>
universe....hmmmmmm. Possibly Cygnus X would have a hall for virtual<br>
beings just above the event horizon, which would be the closest you<br>
could get without actually leaving the universe. Funny, the point<br>
closest to the "edge" of the universe is also closest to its "center".<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lastly, I note that if we can figure out the universal Schelling point, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; might discover that our alien peers have already started meeting there.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Anyone have access to a decent-sized radio observatory?</i><br>
<p>
No but I would say that the event horizon would be the universal meeting<br>
point, as it allows extreme time dilation, allowing the inhabitants to<br>
live to the end of the universe, and possibly through to the next one if<br>
it eventually collapses, or to all travel into the next universe through<br>
the hole that may be created by the singularity they are orbiting. In<br>
this case, One would have to seek out black holes that have beacons<br>
orbiting them to invite passerby to join the party. Also, given this<br>
theory, might radio astronomers find advanced civilizations broadcasting<br>
from blackholes at extremely low (i.e. redshifted) frequencies? Perhaps<br>
we need to find black holes that are far enough away or large enough to<br>
have quiet natural EM bands redshifted to be in synch with those bands<br>
that penetrate an oxygen atmosphere? Pehaps with unusual EM bands?<br>
