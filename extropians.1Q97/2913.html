<i>&gt;Those of you interested in free market solutions should really look at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Feb. '97 issue of Atlantic Monthly in which the cover article is "The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Capitalist Threat"  written by George Soros, one of the greatest, most</i><br>
<i>&gt;successful capitalists of all time.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He says, "Insofar as there is a dominant belief in our society today, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;a belief in the magic of the marketplace.  The doctrine of laissez-faire</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalism hold that the common good is best served by the uninhitited</i><br>
<i>&gt;pursuit of self-interrest.  Unless it is tempered by the recognition of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;common interest that ought to take preference over particular interests, our</i><br>
<i>&gt;present system--is liable to break down."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"By taking the conditions of supply and demand as given and declaring</i><br>
<i>&gt;government intervention the ultimate evel, laissez-faire ideology has</i><br>
<i>&gt;effectively banished income or wealth redistribution....The</i><br>
<i>&gt;laissez-faire-argument relies on the same tacit appeal to perfection as does</i><br>
<i>&gt;communism.  It claims that if redistribution causes inefficiencies and</i><br>
<i>&gt;distortions, the problems can be solved by eliminating redistribution...But</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfection is unattainable.  Wealth does accumulate in the hands of its</i><br>
<i>&gt;owners, and if there is no mechanism for redistribution, the inequities can</i><br>
<i>&gt;become intolerable."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The problem that I see with the market is that it is concerned only with</i><br>
<i>&gt;money.  People don't buy things, money does.  If you don't have money-- more</i><br>
<i>&gt;than half the people on the planet are outside the global economy--you get</i><br>
<i>&gt;no vote.  You don't count.  You are worse than a non-person, you are a</i><br>
<i>&gt;global liability.  Any system which reduces people to non-entities needs</i><br>
<i>&gt;fixing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Steve, Soros' comments are totally and utterly self-serving. Don't be<br>
fooled!  He is doing what people who get to the top have always done:<br>
trying to stay there by toadying to government.  Exactly the same things<br>
were said by political businessmen towards the end of the 19th century,<br>
and the support they gave to the concept of big government led to the<br>
wonderful results we've had for most of this century.<br>
<p>
This is the voice of mercantilism, not capitalism.  Given that<br>
literature reflects opinion, just look at the very first thing he says,<br>
then go to any bookshop in town and count the number of books, popular<br>
and academic, that support laissez faire, then count the number of books<br>
that support intervention.  Get the picture? <br>
<p>
He is, quite simply, lying through his teeth.  Why?  He wants to make<br>
the state more powerful because, being rich, he is in a position to<br>
influence a powerful state to do things to his advantage, to make him<br>
richer.  It doesn't matter a damn to him what ideology the state upholds<br>
- socialism, fascism, it's all the same, just so long as the state<br>
becomes  a more powerful instrument *in itself*. If the USA were even<br>
more fascist than it is he would be singing a fascist song and<br>
critiquing laissez faire from a fascist (e.g. nationalistic) point of<br>
view and you wouldn't hear a peep about the poor and the disadvantaged.<br>
As it is, the present flavour is towards the left, so he falls in with<br>
that.<br>
<p>
You can bet your bottom dollar there wouldn't be very much re-distribution<br>
of *his* money going on!<br>
<p>
Sorry if this is a bit of a rant, but I was just shocked by the utter<br>
cynical evil of what he was saying, and saddened by how you seemed to be<br>
taken in.<br>
