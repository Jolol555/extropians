<i>&gt; It was not a complete description.  I make no appologies for that</i><br>
<i>&gt; since covering all the bases would have turned a paragraph into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; documentary.  To do so was not necessary to the point I was making.</i><br>
<p>
I'm all for brevity; I use it (perhaps too much) myself. If I<br>
misinterpret your elided meaning, please clarify.  But what I think<br>
you are referring to is the very common perception of libertarian<br>
ideology that we have naive faith that free markets solve lots of<br>
human problems and makes everyone peaceful and prosperous--in short,<br>
the L. Neil Smith fantasy world.  It is my contention that very few<br>
of the libertarians I know are like that.  Most are more accepting<br>
of many present systems, wanting to change things in the free market<br>
direction where they feel it is needed.  Some, like me, hold moral<br>
positions that the free market is a necessity, but even we don't<br>
think it will be without problems.  We just believe problems in a<br>
free market are created by reality rather than by the state.  I<br>
recognize reality's right to create problems for me; I make no such<br>
grant to any state.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Stable" is exactly what a free market isn't--and why it's superior</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to any possible planned market.  Stability is stagnation.  Stability</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is death.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By "stable" I only mean that it remains productive, as opposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; grinding to a halt or exploding in a conflict.  I did not mean to </i><br>
<i>&gt; imply that it is unchanging.  </i><br>
<p>
Even that limited definition fails for all systems, including the<br>
free market.  Booms and busts are a natural consequence of supply and<br>
demand; accidents, disasters, blind-luck discoveries, and other events<br>
happen all the time that would destabilize /any/ system.  I happen to<br>
think a free market will handle such conditions deftly and quickly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Highest correlation of effort with reward" is something I would </i><br>
<i>&gt; include in the definition of "fair".  Might also add some degree of </i><br>
<i>&gt; equality of opportunity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lack of coercion is a desireable ideal, but it is not the feature</i><br>
<i>&gt; that makes free markets successful. It is the promise of reaping some</i><br>
<i>&gt; reward in return for your productivity.  Without a reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt; correlation of effort with reward, and without a reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity for success, then the incentive to produce disappears.</i><br>
<p>
I agree completely (except for your words "desirable ideal"; I would<br>
use "necessary precondition").  It would be "better" in the sense of<br>
more productive and fair, in your terms, if there were a higher<br>
correlation of effort and reward.  I cannot, however, conceive of<br>
how that is possible to achieve without constraining and controlling<br>
every human in the system and choking all creativity.  The fact is,<br>
random events will occur.  Rich brats will inherit their productive<br>
father's estates and squander them.  Bums will win lotteries.  Which<br>
scientist makes a critical discovery is more a matter of chance than<br>
either the scientist or Rand would like to admit.  These are just the<br>
facts of reality, and trying to change them is like arguing about<br>
what value of pi would be "best".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Without those two elements, you are left with something that is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; more productive than pure socialism.  Perhaps even worse since even</i><br>
<i>&gt; coercion is more effective than no incentive at all.</i><br>
<p>
This I have to disagree with completely.  Yes, the free market does<br>
not ensure a perfect correlation between productivity and reward.<br>
No system possibly can.  But it /does/ achieve more than enough of a<br>
match to be incredibly productive, and far more than any socialist<br>
system could.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are you arguing that these ideas, whether you include them in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of "fair" or not, are not an integral part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Libertian ideal of a free market economy?  It is because of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; elements that capitilism has enjoyed such success.</i><br>
<p>
Some people's ideals maybe.  I think most are more realistic than<br>
that.  Maybe not.  Maybe they really do believe the L. Neil Smith<br>
nonsense.  But not the ones I know.<br>
<p>
You ask me to recognize that there are "problems" with capitalism<br>
that libertarian ideology doesn't deal with.  That's two claims: <br>
(1) Capitalism has problems, and (2) Libertarians don't deal with<br>
them.  The first I concede: yes, capitalism has precisely those<br>
problems that the nature of human life and reality have--but without<br>
those additional ones created by states.  The second might be true,<br>
but I think it may be an impression left by the fact that the most<br>
vocal libertarians tend to be the most evangelical, and don't like<br>
to talk about problems even if they do recognize them.<br>
