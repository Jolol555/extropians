<i>&gt; &gt;Mostly it is to avoid entropy and obsolescence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I do keep seeing that "general dislike of things physical" one</i><br>
<i>&gt; popping up over and over again, and I don't understand it at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some people seem to somehow think that it is possible to have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; computational process without an identical corresponding physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; process. Uploading is not about leaving the body, it's about swapping</i><br>
<i>&gt; an old body for a new *physical* body, or about gradually transforming</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's body into a different *physical* body. It's distressing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; see silly dualistic metaphors pervading so much talk of uploading.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am quite fond of my body. I find it wanting, primarily, in only</i><br>
<i>&gt; two areas: the planned obsolescence (accumulated delayed-action</i><br>
<i>&gt; death genes... our evolutionary conditions did nothing to weed out</i><br>
<i>&gt; fatal mutations that don't express until after 30 or so) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; inability to function under the conditions that obtain in most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the physical universe. But I can't even form a coherent notion of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what it would be like to exist without a body. I just want a body</i><br>
<i>&gt; that isn't engaged in low-level self-destruction and that is more</i><br>
<i>&gt; comfortable to wear while traveling off-planet. Utility fog might</i><br>
<i>&gt; work nicely, if it can be built.  ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I agree with you here, and in response to your previous reply to me, I<br>
do plan on getting as much augmentation as I can as a biobased organism<br>
to expand my ability to explore and appreciate this universe, I just<br>
plan on waiting till my current body is near the end of its usefulness<br>
before I go totally past it.<br>
<p>
The need for failsafe suspension techniques is of great importance to<br>
me, as unless an FTL drive system can be developed, the time between the<br>
stars, even at 99.9% of C is a goodly chunk of time to play solitaire,<br>
and depending on a machine or another person to unfreeze and rebuild me<br>
is not this engineers idea of useful technique.<br>
<p>
While many in this "Machine Stops" world are fully satisfactory with<br>
telepresence, I am not, except when unavoidable, for the important<br>
experiences. Some would say that having a camera link is the same as<br>
having a link to your own eyes, but I say nay for now. Skiing knee deep<br>
powder at Alta live and in person is nothing like anything telepresence<br>
would offer. IF you think otherwise, prove me wrong. Telepresence and<br>
other remote sensing technologies are great for expanding ones sensory<br>
awareness, but for now cannot replace one's existing awareness. Sure<br>
having remote probes to do advance scouting are great, especially when<br>
exploring space, at least in the sense of reducing risks and maximizing<br>
time utility by culling out negative possibilities (i.e. stars with no<br>
planets, etc), but they will not replace actually setting your own foot<br>
down on an alien beach, meeting alien life forms in person, or skiing<br>
ammonia glaciers on the moons of gas giants....<br>
