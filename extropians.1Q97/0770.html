<i>&gt; I was unaware that anyone considered this attempt to conserve </i><br>
<i>&gt; bandwidth RUDE (caps not mine). I certainly go out of my way </i><br>
<i>&gt; in verbal conversation to credit others when I'm quoting or even </i><br>
<i>&gt; paraphrasing.</i><br>
<p>
I've always wondered about that, too, but it does seem to bother<br>
some people for some reason.  Obviously, to quote someone's words<br>
as your own is clearly deceptive and unfair; but to take a short<br>
excerpt from someone's posting in order to reply is a different<br>
matter altogether.  That's just saying "the idea X has been said<br>
by someone, and I think..." <br>
<p>
Copyright does not apply.  Such excerpts for comment are clearly<br>
fair use under US law.<br>
<p>
Attribution does help clear up 3-way discussions, and clarifies<br>
long-running discussions, so I generally include it if it is not<br>
overly burdensome, but I see no reason to be a slave to them, or<br>
to become annoyed when mine are left out.  In fact, I rather<br>
prefer when my text is not attributed, as it means people are<br>
thinking about the ideas and not my net-persona.<br>
