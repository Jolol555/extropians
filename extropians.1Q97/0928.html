<p>
Ok I looked it up. Sustained speeds of 90mph have been attributed to the  <br>
cheetah but are not considered reliable. The fastest measured speed of a <br>
captive cheetah was an average of 43.4 mph over a distance of 1035 feet at a<br>
oval greyhound track. The animal was not running flat out (she was not hungry)<br>
and had great difficulty at the steep curves. The fastest measured speed of <br>
a cheetah in the wild was between 60 and 63 mph on straight level ground over <br>
a distance of 1641 feet. I would not want to be 300 feet away from a pack of <br>
hungry cheetahs, they would not need to run to catch me, they could just <br>
shuffle off in my direction.<br>
                    <br>

So all the time you will have a big neon sign high up in the air saying  <br>

Sure, but when they need to move fast, like when something wants to eat them, <br>
they run on 4 legs.<br>

                     <br>
<p>
Why? Flint is very hard but also extremely brittle, it's easy to chip off a <br>
piece and you have a razor sharp blade. Lots of such blades were made, <br>
one million years after bipedalism was fully developed, but not one has ever <br>
been found that dated from Lucy's day. <br>

<p>
<i>                &gt;A sharp slate piece can whittle wood very easily.                 </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But not the slightest evidence of such a tool making factory has ever been  <br>
found, not from Lucy's day. Two and a half million years ago, a million years  <br>
after Lucy, it's a very different story.<br>

<i>                &gt;Bows and arrows date to the dawn of recorded history, </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Yes, and recorded history is only a few thousand years old.                <br>

                           <br>
<p>
I am talking about something over 200 times as old and an animal over 200  <br>
times as dumb. Are you seriously trying to tell me that a bow and arrow would  <br>
be easier to make than a sharpened stone or bone? Are you seriously trying to  <br>
tell me that a bow and arrow could even be made without using a sharpened  <br>
stone or bone as a tool?<br>

                           <br>
<p>
Because they were caught in a backwater of cultural evolution. Just an instant <br>
ago, a few thousand years, everybody lived as they do, and that is far too <br>
short for Darwinian biological evolution to be important, but more than enough <br>
time for Lamarckian Cultural Evolution to have a profound effect. I should<br>
also say that it takes far more brain power to survive in the Kalahari Bush <br>
People's world that in our own<br>

<i>                 &gt;&gt;Three and a half million years ago Lucy was fully bipedal                  </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;and had a hand almost as good as ours, but she was dumb,                  </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;her brain ranged from 380 to 450 cc,  modern humans have a                 </i><br>
<i>                 &gt;&gt;range of 1000 to well over 2000 cc.</i><br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Michael:</i><br>
<i>                &gt;you fail to mention how tall she was or how much she massed.                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;What is important is the brain/body mass ratio.</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
Lucy was a little taller than a modern chimp and a little thinner, weighed  <br>
about the same. On average a chimp's brain is about 350cc.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Erectus was originally dated to less than 1.5 mill years.                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;Now hes as far back as 4-5 million. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
But the important thing is the line of decent that uniquely led to humans, as <br>
opposed to some other animal. This line is much shorter than thought 20 years <br>
ago, it's only 5 or 6 million years old. That lends support to the idea that <br>
the Evolution of humans was not an inevitable outcome but a lucky accident.<br>

<i>                &gt;maybe your not smart enough to be a prehuman. </i><br>
                        <br>
<p>
If I was in a nasty mood as you seem to be, I would say that at least I'm <br>
smart enough to know I hadn't invented a machine that violates the law of <br>
conservation of momentum, but I'm not so I won't.<br>

Yes, but again, bears are not bipedal because you don't need to be bipedal to <br>
do that.                             <br>

<p>
<p>
True, but there were plenty of other large fast carnivores, like the ancestor  <br>
of lions and saber tooth tigers.<br>
                                     <br>

<i>                &gt;Australopithecus Afarensis was capable of defending himself                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;against predators, as it seems unlikely that they had much                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;higer reproduction rates, or much slower pregnancy times. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
There is not a particle of evidence that Australopithecus Afarensis engaged <br>
in hunting of any sort, but yes, it must have had some method of dealing with <br>
predators, because despite being slow and weak and having no tools, Lucy's  <br>
kind not only survived they thrived. The mystery is why.<br>
