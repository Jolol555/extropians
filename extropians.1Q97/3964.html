Mr. Lorrey properly pointed out that I had ignored one of his earlier<br>
arguments, and I misinterpreted his later reference to it.  I will<br>
attempt to remedy this.  First, his point:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For example: There have been approximately 5.5 million inventions</i><br>
<i>&gt; patented in the US in it entire history (mostly during periods when</i><br>
<i>&gt; patent rights are vigorously enforced, hint hint) while laborers have</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked approximately 25 x 10^13 hours in US history. This means that</i><br>
<i>&gt; in fair market value, the average invention is equal to 4.55 million</i><br>
<i>&gt; man hours of physical labor in relative scarcity. If we value the</i><br>
<i>&gt; average man hour at as little as $1.00 per hour (which was typical</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the turn of the century, never mind that 2/3 of all workers have</i><br>
<i>&gt; lived since that time) we see that the fair market value for an average</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention is $4.55 million dollars. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any responses to this quoting communist rhetoric and I will puke.</i><br>
<p>
Ignoring the parenthetical hint which is clearly circular (defining<br>
inventions as patented things, then claiming most inventions happened<br>
under patent laws), Mr. Lorrey then calculates that the "relative<br>
scarcity" of an invention is 4.55 million man-hours of labor.  By this<br>
I believe he means to imply that this is an appropriate measure of the<br>
value of an inventor's work, and further that he means to imply that<br>
this income would not be obtained without patents.<br>
<p>
That is at least three independent claims.  The first (the value he<br>
calculates) incorrectly assumes that patent=invention, thereby ignoring<br>
the thousands of inventions that are never patented either because <br>
their creators had no use for patents (high-tech and trendy things<br>
often become obsolete so fast that waiting for and paying for a patent<br>
is a waste of time and resources better spent on getting the thing to<br>
market quickly), or because they couldn't find a sufficient market or<br>
sufficient startup capital, or because they were invented by foreigners<br>
for whom there was no US patent protection until the Paris convention<br>
of 1884.  As a guess, I'd put the number of "inventions", not including<br>
all the little things people build for themselves with no intention of<br>
marketing, at least an order of magnitude higher.<br>
<p>
The second claim, that the relative scarcity of a commodity is in<br>
direct corrolation to its value, just ignores the demand side of the<br>
equation.  It doesn't matter how rare your talents are if nobody has<br>
any use for them.  An inventor, then, must use judgment and take some<br>
risk in deciding how to invest his time so that his creations will<br>
have a better chance at being valuable.  The best way to do that is<br>
probably for him to do research under a capitalist patron, because<br>
capitalists live on their ability to judge investments.  An alternative<br>
"strategy" (in a loose sense) is blind luck.  To happen upon a<br>
discovery by accident--like the vulcanization of rubber--eliminates<br>
the risk, and is a time-honored tradition, primarily because some<br>
things were just to farfetched to have been discovered otherwise.  <br>
However, many chance discoveries resulted from basic research aimed<br>
at other goals, so there was still speculation involved.  Because<br>
that speculation takes capital, and its success is a major factor in<br>
the success of the enterprise, it is the /speculation/, not the<br>
invention, whose scarcity we most prize, and that should benefit the<br>
most from the product.  When the inventor himself does it, he does<br>
indeed reap the benefits, but usually it's a capitalist, and quite<br>
rightly so.  He is, after all, paying the inventor's bills.  So the<br>
relative scarcity of inventions to labor is no measure of value.<br>
<p>
Lastly, it is (presumably, but not explicitly) claimed that without<br>
patents, the inventor would have insufficient incentive to create,<br>
because he would be less likely to be rewarded commensurately with<br>
his "value".  That invention happened before patents is still there<br>
to challenge that idea, but so too are all the other arguments I have<br>
made before about other ways for an inventor (or patron) to profit<br>
from his creations.  Mr. Lorrey elsewhere claims that his experience<br>
of individual contracts being imperfectly honored in courts hampers<br>
most of those methods.  But two wrongs don't make a right: if contract<br>
law is broken, using the patent laws here in question to avoid that<br>
problem rather than tackling the problem directly makes little sense.<br>
And even if individual contracts are hard to enforce, most inventions<br>
are made under the employ of large corporations who /do/ have the<br>
resources to enforce their contracts with each other, which is<br>
sufficient for several of the methods proposed.  This is also moot<br>
in the cases where an lone inventor, without contracts, can manage<br>
to demonstrate an invention without giving away its secret, and<br>
can then sell it to the highest bidder, and in the case where he<br>
can choose never to release specs to the public at all, by making<br>
money with the technology privately.<br>
<p>
Because there are many patentless methods to profit from technology, <br>
and because a patentless system cuts research and developments costs<br>
drastically, I simply don't see that a patentless world automatically<br>
resigns inventors to poverty.  This is not a socialist argument that<br>
inventors must sacrifice profits for the common good, or even a<br>
left-libertarian argument that an inventor only "deserves" what he<br>
can get without resort to force; it is a purely uncompromising<br>
capitalist profit-driven argument that the inventor himself, his<br>
investors, and everyone else benefits more from a system that does<br>
not restrict the unfettered exchange of ideas to whomever can most<br>
efficiently exploit them.<br>
