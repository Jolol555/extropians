              <br>
<p>
But there is no way we could know what that predestined behavior is so we <br>
would still feel free, we would still have free will.<br>
               <br>

<i>        &gt;local rules (Or in more modern terms, in a reality without the </i><br>

               <br>
<p>
Von Neumann was a very great mathematician, I don't think the man was capable <br>
of making a mathematical blunder even if he wanted to, however Von Neumann <br>
was not a great physicists, his mistake was physical not mathematical. <br>
At any rate, I don't think the question of determinism has much to do with <br>
free will because even if the universe is completely deterministic (and I<br>
doubt that it is) it would still not be predictable, and I'm not just talking <br>
about practical concerns and chaos theory.<br>
               <br>

<i>        &gt;I think the best guidance on this subject doesn't even come from         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;physics, but from Godel </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
I agree, and Turing's work may be even better, he proved that no computer <br>
program (and I think that's what we are) can predict what it will do next, <br>
that is, if it will ever stop. The easiest, indeed the only way to know what <br>
a computer program will do is to run it and see, we figure out what we are <br>
going to do when we actually do it. This would be true regardless of whether <br>
the Universe is deterministic or not. <br>
