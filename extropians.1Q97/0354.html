I've just finished Stephen Jay Gould's 1996 book known in the USA as FULL<br>
HOUSE and elsewhere as LIFE'S GRANDEUR, and wonder what other readers on<br>
this list made of it.<br>
<p>
Gould's theme is that natural diversity is usually attributable to nothing<br>
more interesting than a drunkard's walk away from a wall.  Life starts<br>
simple (against the `left wall') because it can't start any other way.<br>
Mostly it stays simple, by mensurable metrics. Even now, arguably, most of<br>
the earth's biomass is simple bacteria.  Over time, some variants wander off<br>
to the right.  Humans and other large critters exist off on the right-most<br>
tail of the curve, but not because there is any `complexification drive'.<br>
The test of this anti-progressivist thesis is, e.g., whether ancestors are<br>
simpler or more complex (by some measure) than descendants.  Dan McShea's<br>
landmark studies show a random balance of the two directions.   (McShea was<br>
at Michigan, is now at the Santa Fe Institute.)  He finds that diversity is<br>
better explained by `passive' than by `driven' trends.  The argument seems<br>
solid.<br>
<p>
I wonder what the other Santa Fe folks make of this.  Stuart Kauffman urged<br>
Roger Lewin to talk to McShea when Lewin was writing his (excellent)1993 pop<br>
sci book COMPLEXITY.  Dawkins, at the other extreme, also insists that<br>
there's no tendency in evolution toward greater complexity, merely toward<br>
successful adaptation to fortuitously changing conditions.  Since the Red<br>
Queen's race argument insists that some of those environmental conditions<br>
include other contestants, I'd have expected a driven complexifying trend to<br>
show up.  Not so, insists Gould and his sources.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, for baseball fans (Australians like me haven't got a clue),<br>
his argument for why 0.400 batting has vanished due to general *improvement*<br>
of the game (closing up of variance) is beautiful and compelling.  This must<br>
surely map in part on to the observed difference between males and females<br>
on aptitude tests - I wonder if it means that general excellence in females<br>
permits less opportunity for extreme outliers, so the `absence of women<br>
geniuses' is an artefact of the metric?  (Probably not, since both sexes are<br>
tested by the same instrument and their scores can be compared directly.<br>
Still, it might have some bearing on the issue...)<br>
<p>
Anyone else read this Gould book yet?<br>
