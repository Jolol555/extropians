I have to second this, but would add that there could also be differences<br>
from person to person on the neurological and biochemical levels for a myriad<br>
of reasons.  All told, the fact that such a vast range of intelligence (or at<br>
least apparent intelligence) exists within the human race, leads inevitably<br>
to the conclusion that this brain size business is of much lesser immediate <br>
importance than the initial article seemed to imply.<br>
