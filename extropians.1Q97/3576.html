I believe I've mentioned Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_, and<br>
that I found it to be a spiffy book.  One of his provocative (although<br>
not too important for his main point) asides was his belief that modern<br>
hunter-gatherers are more intelligent than most modern "civilizeds" at<br>
least in practice, and possibly genetically.<br>
<p>
His case (somewhat vague, again it's just an aside for him, at least in<br>
this book) is based on long observation of New Guinean peoples and the<br>
favorable comparison he makes with your average urbanite.  His<br>
theoretical argument is necessity -- since everyone is approximately<br>
responsible for their own survival, they have to be more competent and<br>
knowledgeable about their environment.  More importantly than simple<br>
knowledge, he feels that they're more curious; they play with their<br>
environment more, because that's what a hunter-gatherer does.  "Ooh, new<br>
plant, or rock; what is it good for?"  Missionaries and colonialists no<br>
doubt have smiled knowingly at the primitive playing childlike with<br>
simple artifacts of civilization, like a lighter or paper clip; but I<br>
suspect your average Western tourist would ignore most of the novelty<br>
around themself, or else if confronted by it retreat and whimper.<br>
<p>
His argument for genetically superior intelligence is that<br>
hunter-gatherers -- at least some of them, others apparently can be<br>
placidly dull, ignoring an unprecedented helicopter (whereas those he<br>
favors "would be trying to charter it") -- have been living this way all<br>
along, and been selected for greater intelligence and adaptability.<br>
After all, hunter-gatherer conditions are apparently the conditions<br>
under which we developed intelligence in the first place.  Urban<br>
Eurasians, on the other hand, have primarily been selected for the<br>
ability to survive the diseases we get from our domesitc animals.<br>
<p>
What noticeable change could have happened in the past 13,000 years is<br>
open to question.  Still, even without genetics, some hunter-gatherers<br>
might retain the flexibility of their heritage while switfly picking up<br>
modern culture.  Which leads me to my main point: whether               <br>
hunter-gatherer peoples (those who have survived our diseases, achoo)<br>
might not be the proper heirs of the human race.  With a good technical<br>
education, and their own flexibility and (I hope) lack of monotheistic<br>
religious baggage, they might be the ones best suited *as a group* to<br>
picking up transhuman mindsets.  Cryonics and genetic engineering and<br>
whatnot should, in Diamond's painting, just be more tools to play with<br>
to them.<br>
<p>
Just a thought.<br>
