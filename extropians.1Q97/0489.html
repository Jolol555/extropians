My two cents:<br>
<p>
Mike,<br>
I read Robin's timeframe as billions of years, and his metric as something like "the <br>
centroid of the biomass". It looks to me as if your timeframe is tens <br>
of thousands of years, and your metric--well, what specifically *is* <br>
your metric?<br>
<p>
Curt, <br>
(your comment was snipped, I'm commenting on a later paragraph <br>
from memory--apologies if I got something wrong...)<br>
I'm not sure of the existence of souls or demons, either. :) It seems to me <br>
that positing some obscure "other complexification" drive is easy;<br>
the more obscure you make it, the more unfalsifiable the idea is...<br>

Maximum body size has not been increasing. It is a function of several<br>
things, mostly average environment temperature. Animals during the<br>
