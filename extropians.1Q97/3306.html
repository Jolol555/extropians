I fully grant that the more explicit you can make your reasoning, the<br>
better you and others can trust it.  On the other hand, formal<br>
explicit reasoning takes more time and is more costly.   The choice<br>
between them depends on the extra costs and benefits in any given<br>
situation. <br>
<p>
I just don't agree that the costs of formal explicit reasoning always<br>
outweigh the benefits as soon as you deal with social issues or try to<br>
persuade other people.   Things are really much more complex that<br>
that. Nor do I agree that the predictive value of informal<br>
analysis falls to zero in such contexts.  <br>
<p>
Our ordinary lives are full of social issues and persuasion contexts<br>
where we appropriately use just as much hueristic analysis as you do<br>
when driving.  No need to feel guilty about driving heuristically nor<br>
about heuristic social analysis.  But of course one's confidence in<br>
any one prediction should take into account the type of analysis used,<br>
the solidity of the data it was based on, and the strength of<br>
connection perceived between the data and related models and predictions.<br>
