Flutter The Wings Of Reality<br>
<p>
<p>
A shrouded man in his shredded cocoon<br>
Is trying to extend his withered arms<br>
And make them wings,<br>
To fly his sorry self to the glowing moon.<br>
He is falling through skies with a diminishing hope;<br>
His mind an unreachable void,<br>
His heart a blanket of fear<br>
Clutching an untied rope.<br>
And at the moment of glory, the man does try<br>
To make his arms flutter rapidly,<br>
And punish the air<br>
In a feeble attempt to fly;<br>
But no matter what he attempts to do,<br>
The ground rapidly presents itself--<br>
Though it had always been there<br>
And the man's distant wish doesn't come true.<br>
He hits the ground with tremendous force,<br>
And in the second that he dies,<br>
He acknowledges reality...<br>
And sees his mistake in an instant of remorse.<br>
