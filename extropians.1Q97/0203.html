What the heck is this business with Libertarianism and Socialism being<br>
used as synonyms?  Libertarianism may be defined very simply as the<br>
belief that government is evil and that the optimal society has a<br>
government which does not act except in cases of "force and fraud"; many<br>
are unsure about "fraud"; a few dispense with "force".<br>
<p>
The capitalist-vs.-socialist dilemna is also very simple.  Capitalists<br>
put their faith in the emergence of the wealth-maximizing property; to<br>
put it another way, a society in which every person attempts to maximize<br>
his personal wealth will have maximal global wealth.  Socialism is the<br>
belief that everyone should try to maximize global wealth.  Socialism<br>
doesn't work because capitalism is more strongly supported by our<br>
evolved emotional architectures.  If billions of years of evolution all<br>
worked to ensure that the individual who maximized global wealth<br>
survived and reproduced - as in the case of hive colonies - then the<br>
U.S. would have collapsed instead of the U.S.S.R., as the citizens asked<br>
themselves why they should sweat for no conceivable global benefit.<br>
<p>
I don't know what delusion is leading someone to claim that most<br>
Libertarians are socialists, but this is drastically and maximally<br>
contradicted by my personal experience.<br>
