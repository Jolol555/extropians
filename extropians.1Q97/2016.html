re: What is going on in macrocausality, where does coherency and<br>
intelligibility come from, and how do we get from the small to the big.<br>
<p>
Omega wrote 1/30/97: &lt;While an ultimate answer may never be found although<br>
we may be in the position to make some long overdue breakthroughs in this<br>
area.&gt;<br>
<p>
David Wick's survey of the theories and their conceptual development in<br>
these areas is good ("The Infamous Boundary" (1996)).  He seems to struggle<br>
a bit over the shape of better theories, especially whether it is better<br>
for the theories to violate active vs. passive locality as long as they<br>
have a well-defined notion of outcomes, but in the end he says: "The last<br>
possibility, and clearly the correct one, is that there is some totally new<br>
way of looking at Nature."  Isn't this always true?<br>
<p>
re: John Cramer's transactional interpretation and 'advanced action.' <br>
Compare this visualization of advanced action with David Bohm's development<br>
of De Broglie's 'pilot wave' into the notion of 'active information' (in<br>
"The Undivided Universe" (1993)).  I haven't been following this thread<br>
closely, perhaps this has already come up.<br>
<p>
&lt;In the formal interpretation, these backward in time answers also carry<br>
negative energy, and so nothing really weird comes from it except for the<br>
clarity that 50% of all microcausality is happening as a result of advanced<br>
action.&gt;<br>
<p>
I realize that discrete models of microcausality have been proposed for a<br>
couple hundred years, and have been repeatedly rejected in favor of<br>
indiscrete models by the scientific community.  However, I believe that a<br>
discrete model will eventually prevail in explanatory power.<br>
<p>
Feynman hinted at such a possibility in "QED": "It's surprising that the<br>
[QED] theory still hasn't been proved self-consistent one way or the other<br>
by now....  What is certain is that we do not have a good mathematical way<br>
to describe the theory of QED....  Another way of describing this<br>
difficulty is to say that perhaps the idea that two points can be<br>
infinitely close together is wrong ­ the assumption that we can use<br>
geometry down to the last notch is false."<br>
<p>
We'll leave aside the completeness of complex-number realms for now.<br>
<p>
Katsuhiro Nakamura in "Quantum Chaos" (1993) discusses how quantum chaos<br>
requires that we "go beyond Schrödinger's or Feynman's framework of quantum<br>
mechanics."  He begins discussing 'broken symmetry in dissipative<br>
structures' and energy systems without time-reversal symmetry.  He improves<br>
Schrödinger's formalism of quantum mechanics by replacing the time<br>
derivative in the time-dependent equation with a time difference, because<br>
he wants to refer to time-chaotic waves rather than time-periodic waves. <br>
Thus, he discretizes time with a delta-t, a suitable 'time quantum,' and<br>
uses a discrete version of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.<br>
<p>
He goes on to say: "Time discretization will necessitate much more complete<br>
discretization of space-time....  [I]f temporal chaos is brought into<br>
quantum mechanics, our ideas on time, stationary states, the adiabatic<br>
ansatz and their relationship with the uncertainty principle should be<br>
carefully re-examined.  These intriguing questions (even within<br>
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics) would be comparable to Einstein's great<br>
challenge in 1905 which revolutionized Galilean thought on space and time. <br>
In nature, external sources of randomness such as noise, impurities and<br>
random potentials are inevitable elements.  These effects have so far been<br>
regarded as the unique source of spectral width in magnetic resonance,<br>
fluctuations in conductance, etc., but quantum chaos ­ deterministic<br>
randomness ­ may be a novel alternative candidate for spectral width and<br>
fluctuations in various observables."<br>
<p>
I cannot help but think that with a more complete discretization of<br>
space-time, that one discrete state cannot happen, the universal discrete<br>
state of *now* cannot de duplicated exactly in the next 'time quantum' for<br>
obvious reasons.  This closes off one propagation avenue in the negative<br>
energy direction, leaving advanced action with more than 50% of<br>
microcausality.  Thus, we go forward instead of backward, time-reversal<br>
asymmetry.<br>
