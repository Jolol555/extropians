On replacing the Julian calendar.<br>
<p>
I am amused by the Extropist suggection that it was time to replace the<br>
archoiaic Julian calandar for something a litlle more progresssive.  But<br>
I found the suggestion to supplant the birth of Jesus with a more<br>
Extropicaly correct refferent (Galileo, etc.) to byso a remarabaly<br>
myopic solution to a well-stated problem.  I was puzxzled by the similar<br>
qu4estions about the implication of our culturally based notions of<br>
calandar nad tyhe inherent baises and cconceptual blinders it emb0odies <br>
while in high school some twenty ytears ago.  <br>
<p>
My problem at the time was the noted difference between our individual<br>
nad separate existences in space - generic to the notoion of individual,<br>
compared to the univeraal acceptance of absolute time zonces.  Though we<br>
each exist in individual time zones, we share our time frames.  The fact<br>
that there are at least a couple dozen time zones and a variety of<br>
cuyltures which do not participate in the notions of time with which we<br>
take for granted doesw not undermine the observation tyhat we share our<br>
time frames with innumerable other souls.<br>
<p>
My solution at the time was simple - divide the twenty four hours<br>
availablke to the day into not a couple dozen, but into millions,<br>
billions of individual time zones - enough, in fact, so that each of<br>
would live in a unique, personal time frame.  I envisioned myself ek=ing<br>
out a living by managing the company that would administer the<br>
allocation of the zones for the billions of individuals to which they<br>
would apply.  But high school ended and I shelved the idea in favour of<br>
more important thimngs.  The only tangible effect was that I reset my<br>
watch back half an hour, encouraged my friends to do the same (tto a<br>
different zone of course) and for a year or so actually put my notions<br>
of tome into practice.<br>
<p>
But returning to the immediate problem put forth by Extropic thought, I<br>
would like to propose a solution that at once addresse sthe concern of<br>
those upset by ethnocentric Julianism, elides the problems generated by<br>
the comventional? Extroopic suggestions, and adiitionally depends on<br>
technology that is only now becoming universally available enough to<br>
make the solution feasible.  The idea, once again, is simple — the<br>
refferent baseline becomes now.  It is now always 0:00:00 on the firstr<br>
of (fill in the blank). <br>
<p>
Of course, such a redefinition is not without consquense.  Firstly,<br>
historical dates are no longer fixed, but refer, of course, to now. <br>
Jesus was born in BN.1994, almost 2000 years ago.  World War II came to<br>
a close in BN.49 years ago.  I left the house thius morning at 3:00:00,<br>
or three hours ago.  The result is a radically new (literal)<br>
perspefctive on history.  Just what such changes would mean would feul<br>
many debates.  <br>
<p>
Secondly, since historical dates are no longer static, and are<br>
incountinual flux as now moves forward, history itself must now be<br>
maintained.  Every date becomes a clock, measuring its distance to<br>
today.  Difficult to implement in paper media, but a breeze in any<br>
electronic format.<br>
<p>
Abd thirdly, such a conceptual shift does not conflict, at least in<br>
princial, though it does complicate matters, with my naive high school<br>
notion of allocating unique time zones to each individual.  Everyone<br>
could be assigned a unique random number between one and , say, 50<br>
million. That would then become a personal reference.  Of course there<br>
exists the danger that a kind of chono-elitism would arise, with those<br>
possessing lower baselinbe refferents being envied by those further douw<br>
the line.<br>
