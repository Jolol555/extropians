Let's see, I am sure we will have a few KQb quite soon. I bet it will be<br>
interesting, possibly useful but not lauch us into the singularity the<br>
night after the laboratory prototype works. Just because you can design<br>
proteins well doesn't mean nanotech and SI will appear next tuesday. Of<br>
course, a KQb would still speed up things substantially, but to really get<br>
into the singularity we need to reach the strongly intelligence augmenting<br>
regime; a QAI might come in handy. <br>

Yes, it is both reversible and could possibly become very dense. The <br>
question is how long the coherence times and lengths can be made; the <br>
last results suggest several minutes at least. <br>
<p>

<p>
Just joking/trying to find an application. <br>

<p>
There exists another fun calculation that allows you to find the x:th<br>
digit of pi in O(something small) without calculating the previous d-1<br>
digits, this has been used to calculate the ten billionth digit of pi; see<br>

<p>
I wonder if there is some way of calculating pi faster on a quantum <br>
computer. <br>
