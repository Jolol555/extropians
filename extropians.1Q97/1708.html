[Saith Lee Daniel Crocker:]<br>
<i>&gt; The comment to which I replied was something along the lines of "in</i><br>
<i>&gt; 100 years, you wouldn't recognize English", and I disagree.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; factors that lead to the changes from Chaucer to Shakespeare to </i><br>
<i>&gt; modern English just aren't there anymore: today we travel more, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; interact with more people, we all watch the same television shows</i><br>
<i>&gt; and movies.  400 years from now, there will be lots of new vocabulary</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the new technologies and new social forms, but today's English</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be understandable to those children without effort--including</i><br>
<i>&gt; its present sounds, which have changed more over the years than</i><br>
<i>&gt; writing simply because writing has been around longer than sound</i><br>
<i>&gt; recording.  In fact, it is interesting to note that speakers of</i><br>
<i>&gt; different dialects of Chinese today understand each other only with</i><br>
<i>&gt; considerable effort, but they both can read Lao-Tsu with ease.</i><br>
<p>
[Let it be known that the following post is in the subjunctive mode.<br>
 I do not believe that there will be enough TIME for English to change.]<br>
<p>
Here's an interesting idea:  Automatic translation.<br>
<p>
Not just automatic translation from English to Chinese, but from English<br>
to English.  In fact, English to English would seem so much easier.  An<br>
Ebonics-to-English or English-to-Ebonics automatic translator might be<br>
employed for Web-surfing by the disadvantaged.  I do not support this<br>
idea - in fact I think it's lunacy - but many modern educators might<br>
think otherwise.<br>
<p>
The result, assuming no Singularity and continuing for the next 100<br>
years?<br>
<p>
No languages.  Or at least, no universal public languages.  Errors<br>
accumulate.  A child learns two languages from its parents, blends them<br>
together, and goes on to coin neologisms and alter syntactic principles<br>
to taste.  But the loving automatic translators ensure that there's no<br>
problem.<br>
<p>
So 100 years from now, there might be some individual languages that are<br>
recognizably English, but not very many of them - say 1 in 1000.  What<br>
was that about the Internet melting pot and sound-recording error<br>
correction?<br>
