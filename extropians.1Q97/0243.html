Another turbo-lurker here (I saw this term used by someone<br>
earlier, and liked it). I'm keeping up with the extropian<br>
list digests when I can find time, and generally enjoying<br>
the discussions.<br>
<p>
An idea hit me from out of the blue today while I was pondering<br>
in general about the internet. This idea might be very good if<br>
it holds up well to scrutiny. It's so simple (and probably<br>
naive) that I can't believe that no one else has thought of it,<br>
or shot it down before. I'll sketch it very roughly:<br>
<p>
GLOBAL NETWORK ECONOMIC SCHEME<br>
<p>
Instead of charging real money in cyberspace, charge<br>
"virtual money" that does not necessarily relate<br>
directly to real money. HTTP servers and other TCP/IP<br>
services could charge by "page", by hit, by entry into<br>
an "area", or whatever from the user's (or agent's)<br>
virtual account.<br>
<p>
Let the virtual money establish a value for itself. For<br>
example, one could purchase (using local currency) X<br>
number of credits/tokens (X would depend on the current<br>
state of the market) with your $19.95 ISP monthly fee<br>
($10 of the $19.95 would probably be your connection<br>
fee). If you run out of credits, you can purchase more<br>
from your ISP (or someone else), earn them yourself by<br>
providing info services, etc; if you have extra credits,<br>
you can save them or convert them into real currency.<br>
All charges on the internet would be deductions of<br>
virtual money, not "real money". This could very nicely<br>
solve the international payment problem. This payment<br>
model could apply to digital television programs (pay-<br>
per-view), etc. since such digital data will arguably<br>
be transfered over the net in the future.<br>
<p>
This scheme would leave our existing financial system<br>
completely intact. Each country could convert between<br>
their local currency and cyber-credits based on their<br>
current market value. Hell, governments could even tax<br>
such conversions if they wanted to (cyber-transactions<br>
would not be taxed, however, since they would occur in<br>
a global space). The cyber money would be its own neutral<br>
currency, its value based on the market for information<br>
within itself. Any credits that one earned would best be<br>
spent on other internet services, of course (no tax),<br>
and the best way to obtain credits would be to earn them<br>
rather than purchase them in real world currency.<br>
(Businesses would, however, need to "cash in" their cyber<br>
money for real dollars/pesos/etc periodically.) In this<br>
sense, it would be natural to think of cyberspace as a<br>
country with its own currency (and zero transaction<br>
cost--well, at least no taxes on transactions), with<br>
conversion rates to and from the "real world" currencies.<br>
<p>
Many types of information should remain free on the internet,<br>
of course--ADVERTISING (those guys should probably pay us),<br>
for instance. Also, public info, private homepages, general<br>
information, some educational info, etc.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that it would be far easier to build an<br>
tracking and verification system into current internet<br>
software that worked with imaginary units of currency<br>
(at first), get it bootstrapped and working, and finally<br>
"turn it on" when everything checked out to the internet<br>
communities approval THAN to place our real world bank <br>
accounts and credit lines "on tap" on the internet. Getting<br>
the later scheme to work internationally will take years,<br>
and is being undertaken by governments and a few powerful<br>
corporations, each seeking to be key middlemen. The<br>
virtual money scheme could be a general software-driven<br>
one operating on open protocols developed by an (adhoc)<br>
international internet commitee, and would not require<br>
the permission of any governments to be deployed. It would<br>
require the support and cooperation of the majority of<br>
internet software developers and commercial businesses,<br>
however.<br>
<p>
Is there anything to this idea? Has it been proposed and<br>
shot down already? I realize that it is very sketchy at<br>
this point, but I have details dancing about in my head<br>
should it prove worthy of further development.<br>
