<i>        &gt;the list, of those with money will never get solved.[...] A good         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;standard of life in third world countries. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I have 2 Questions:<br>
1) If rich people in western countries are not interested in paying money to   <br>
   increase the standard of living in the third world, why is it likely that <br>
   the poorer people in western countries would be willing to pay?<br>
<p>
2) If people don't want to voluntarily give money, why would they vote for a   <br>
   politician who forces them to?<br>

<i>        &gt;A pure free market system can't guarantee a fair amount of social         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;mobility through education. As it is based on keeping the 'have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nots' dumb. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A well educated consumer is a prosperous consumer so a prosperous consumer <br>
consumes more than a ignorant consumer and that is very good for business. An <br>
ignorant follower with blind patriotism is good for the king but an educated <br>
follower might get ideas, and that is not good for our fearless leader.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A free market system can work, but not without guarantees. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is not Mathematics, forget about certainty. In the real world no social  <br>
system, not dictatorship not democracy and not the market, can give you any  <br>
guarantees. I will admit that the market does better than government only 95% <br>
of the time, but we can live with a little inefficiency in the remaining 5%.<br>
                         <br>

<i>        &gt;I'm not talking about giving away things or sharing the wealth here,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;i'm talking about investing in people so that they will be able to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;work themselves into a position where they can buy more of your     </i><br>
<i>        &gt;services or goods. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you're really serious about the word "investing" then that's a job for <br>
free enterprise. Unfortunately whenever some entrepreneur try's to do just <br>
what you suggest, for reasons I don't understand, he is treated as a great <br>
villain and people throw around words like "exploitation" and "sweatshop".<br>

                         <br>
<p>
As an expert of widget manufacturing  I can form 3 conclusions. <br>
1) Widgets are expensive to make, if you're giving them away you're lousing   <br>
   a ton of money. <br>
2) Widgets will not be free forever. <br>
3) I hope you are very stubborn and I hope you're corporation has a LOT of   <br>
   money.<br>
<p>
I buy (not the right word really, they're free) widgets by the warehouse full <br>
from you, if you can make them I will buy them and then ask for more. <br>
Now that demand is so huge you MUST build more widget factories if they are <br>
to remain free or even just cheap, and after you finished that factory you <br>
must build another one and then another. When the day comes when you regain<br>
your sanity or just go broke I will have a huge supply of widgets that cost  <br>
me nothing to obtain that I can sell for many years at an enormous profit.<br>

<i>        &gt;Capitalism is good, but it is not perfect.          </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
That's true, and history has taught us that government always works with <br>
absolute perfection.<br>

<i>        &gt;loyalty/habit-of-purchase to his product.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I confess I know nothing about your example, however I find it impossible to <br>
believe that price was the only or even the most important factor in the <br>
success of Murdoch's newspapers, people must like them. There are lots of  <br>
newspapers I wouldn't read for free, and some you'd have to pay me to read.<br>
