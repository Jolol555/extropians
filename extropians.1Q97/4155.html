Actually, duplicating them has a point. As you say, they are a form of <br>
primitive cognition that is quick and not unnecessarily complex. This is <br>
ideal for simple robotics! Being a bit of a connectionist I might be a <br>
bit biased, but subsumption architectures and neural net modules are <br>
clearly very promising for building robots. Having a robot with a limbic <br>
system is actually a quite good idea; it will want to please its owner, <br>
it will avoid harm and mistakes (they feel bad), it would learn and <br>
associate. For many tasks there is no need for a complex brain, drives <br>
and motivation suffice quite well. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But unless you uploaded into a system that did duplicate them, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't experience them, I think. (Then again, maybe that does provide</i><br>
<i>&gt; a 'point' to the exercise of trying to duplicate them?)</i><br>
<p>
It would be meaningless to upload into a system that didn't duplicate the <br>
limbic system - why upload only *part* of the brain? Uploading will most <br>
likely encompass everything from the brainstem and upwards (and I'll <br>
admit that I have been thinking about the spinal cord too). The point of <br>
the Strong AI hypothesis is that duplicating emotion only is a matter of <br>
the right software structure, the hardware is irrelevant as long as it <br>
can run it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This wouldn't be transhuman so much as totally non-human, perhaps no</i><br>
<i>&gt; different from the experience of a built or evolved AI.</i><br>
<p>
Would be interesting to try. <br>
