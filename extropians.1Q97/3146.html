Robin Hanson:<br>
<i>&gt;Most of us aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt;so wealthy in friend-attracting features that we can insist on friends</i><br>
<i>&gt;who share most of their deepest values.  We're happy for you, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;realize we may not all be as rich as you. </i><br>
<p>
I don't know why you would assume that I would have an easier time <br>
than other people finding true friends.   My looks?  I made one of the <br>
closest friends of my life during the years spent recovering from a <br>
crippling accident, and believe me I wasn't pretty to look at then, <br>
or much fun to be with.  My personality?  Sure, I meet a lot of <br>
people socially, but most of them wouldn't accept my independence or <br>
outlook, so I don't pursue more than an acquaintence.  <br>
<p>
The bottom line for me is that I would rather not have any friends than <br>
to have to pretend to be someone else to have one.  Oddly, once I <br>
made that decision, the search became easier.  Yes, I am rich, and I <br>
would be rich if I only had one friend in the world, because each <br>
friend is a treasure.  Treasure takes work to find, tho, and sometimes a <br>
sacrifice or two.  Treasure in abundance would have no real value.<br>
<p>
