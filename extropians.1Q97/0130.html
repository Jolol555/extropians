A somewhat belated followup on the PDA thread:<br>
<p>
First of all I'd like to point out the excellent weekly freeware newsletter:<br>
NewtNews (which is also available as pdf). It focuses primarily on the <br>
Newt, but is also covers the other PDAs.<br>

as the body of your message (no quotes).<br>
<p>
I happen to have used the Newton MessagePad 130 for quite a time. The <br>
price delta to the MessagePad 120 is considerable, while the only <br>
differences being the backlit screen and 512 kByte less core (this needs <br>
BackDropPlus, a heap optimizer and GUI enhancer for better performance, less <br>
heap is bad for multitasking several apps). The processor is the same, as is <br>
the ROM image (NOS 2.0). The Newton Toolkit (NTK), the development kit demo <br>
for the Newt is available on the web (the only difference to the <br>
commercial is that it compiles a 'this is a demo' message into every <br>
application you develop with it). The Newt has an ARM (a 32 bit RISC) at <br>
20 MHz, but since it executes interpreted code (NewtonScript), it is not <br>
very fast. Character recognition has grown drastically better since the <br>
first newts, NOS 2.0 in fact contains _two_ character recognition <br>
engines: one learning, continuous script (telescopic stylus), and one <br>
single-character modus, containing a large database with character <br>
samples. This is better than Graffiti (ex-Newt add-on, and U.S. Robo's <br>
Pilot status quo). The Newt has a sophisticated power management, and it <br>
shows in battery lifetime. Newt can digest NiMH, if only the internal <br>
switch is kept pressed (the original Apple NiCd do it automagically), <br>
e.g. by putting a piece of plastic/cardboard into the battery cage).<br>
The Newt has a serial port, and a single PCMCIA II slot. The software <br>
coming with it allows one to snapshot/restore current state (RAM and <br>
possible flash memory card), and to install packages (hint: there is a <br>
lot of shareware/freeware out there). A lot of goodies is available: an <br>
external keyboard (not just now, the company has gone broke and Apple is <br>
looking for another one), docking station with modem, etc. etc. The Newt <br>
has an IR port, but it's not IrDA. The Newt is a bit thin on built-in <br>
software, and slightly too slow, imo. Also, imo, software quality is <br>
somewhat lacking.<br>
<p>
I'd suggest to wait for the next Newt, the Newton 2000, which should <br>
become available this spring. The feature list is truly mind-boggling, so <br>
check out<br>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.newton.apple.com/newton/productinfo/MP2000/MP2000ds.htm">http://www.newton.apple.com/newton/productinfo/MP2000/MP2000ds.htm</a><br>
<p>
Imo, the Newt is years ahead of the competition, but it's still a toy. <br>
The Newt 2000 should be truly usable, though. I think the Wince's have <br>
been severely overhyped, but they will probably outsell anything having a <br>
microprocessor in them. The Pilot has its niche, being small/light and <br>
having hotplug-resynch. The Psions are certainly nice, dunno know much <br>
about the HP OmniGo. <br>
<p>
I say: check out the Newt2000, it's a potential killer. Should even have <br>
speech input by end-1997.<br>
