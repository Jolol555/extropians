Reilly Jones quotes some comments from Omega I have not seen before, I've <br>
been having trouble with mail the last few days and  I did think one of his <br>
posts ended a little abruptly<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Since the inevitableness of self-referenced Turing unpredictability         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is really just another another way of saying that all systems suffer         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;from Godelian incompleteness with regard to the subject of their own        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;behavior</i><br>
<p>
Godel and Turing did different things. Godel proved that any logical system <br>
is incomplete or inconsistent or both. Turing showed that you can't, <br>
in  general, prove that a statement is untrue or true but unprovable, <br>
so you can never tell if the best thing to do is just give up looking for <br>
a proof. Maybe you'll find a proof to prove it correct or a counterexample <br>
to prove it wrong in 5 minutes, maybe 5 in 5 billion years, maybe never.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Your definition of free will is so mutant that it no longer even         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;claims to be something that represents a causal principle by which         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;an entity would effect its "will" within the world </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Let's look at something a little less emotional than free will , pressure. <br>
When I blow up a balloon pressure causes it to expand and eventually pop. <br>
But what is this thing "pressure"? Is it a mysterious non material fifth <br>
force that floats around in no particular place and causes things to expand? <br>
No, pressure is just a higher level description, a description of the <br>
collective motions of particles. The molecules don't know anything about<br>
pressure, they just bounce around according to Newton's law's of motion. <br>
Our tiny brains are not able to cope with the trillions of collisions of air <br>
molecules against the side of the balloon so we must go to a higher level <br>
description. In this example you lose a little accuracy but at a HUGE saving <br>
in complexity, in some cases you may not lose any accuracy at all. <br>
Although It is perfectly true that William Shakespeare made his living and<br>
reputation by putting a subset of ASCII characters in a particular sequence <br>
I think you would do better in  a literature  test if you thought about it at <br>
a somewhat higher level.        <br>
<p>
Similarly it's usually not appropriate to talk about quantum jumps or even <br>
neuron firings when trying to understand human behavior (although <br>
Nanotechnology may change that) ; we use higher level concepts like reason, <br>
judgment, belief, preference, emotion and free will.           <br>
Wow, all this talk about higher level meaning has made me hungry, I think <br>
I'll go to a restaurant, look at the air pressure graph I made at the last<br>
Beethoven Symphony and relax. <br>
<p>
Of my own free will, I consciously decide to go to a restaurant.<br>
Why?   <br>
Because I want to.   <br>
Why?   <br>
Because I want to eat.  <br>
Why?  <br>
Because I'm hungry?   <br>
Why ?  <br>
Because lack of food triggered nerve impulses  in my stomach , my brain  <br>
interpreted these signals as pain, I can only stand so much before I try to <br>
stop it.   <br>
Why?  <br>
Because I don't like pain.  <br>
Why?   <br>
Because that's the way my brain is constructed.   <br>
Why?  <br>
Because my body and the hardware of my brain were made from the information  <br>
in my genetic code  (lets see, 6 billion base pairs 2 bits per base pair  <br>
8 bits per byte that comes out to about 1.5 geg, you could put it on a <br>
700 meg hard disk with stacker)  the programming of my brain came from the  <br>
environment, add a little quantum randomness perhaps and of my own free will  <br>
I consciously decide to go to a restaurant.<br>
            <br>

<i>        &gt;and thus amounts to a tautology that expresses nothing more than         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the Godelian incompleteness of a self-referencing entity regarding         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;its own behavior.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, it's a tautology, in exactly the same way that all true equations are <br>
tautologies, the same idea expressed in a different way. <br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Tautology definitions:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;1: Needless repetition of the same sense in different words.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
OK, if you want to play that game, please give me a non circular definition  <br>
of the word "definition".<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;2: A logical statement which can never be false.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Say what you want about tautologies they do have one great virtue, they are <br>
true.   <br>
