<i>&gt;                 &gt;needed an alternate way to run fast, e.g., bipedalism;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is nothing fast about bipedalism. Humans have good endurance, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; they have no hair and are good at getting rid of waste heat, but as for speed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the possible exception of the ground sloth humans are the slowest mammal</i><br>
<i>&gt; on earth.</i><br>
<p>
The fastest human is around 18 mph in a dash for a few hundred yards, or<br>
10 mph for miles and miles. The cheetah at 60 mph, or the lion at 30 mph<br>
(both for only a few hudred yards) would still need to get within a 100<br>
yards to ba able to overtakea human prey, except for slower children or<br>
women burdened by them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;being able to stand fully erect also allows the animal to</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;see farther across the open savanna and more ably find prey</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;or avoid danger</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lots of animals can stand on their hind legs, you don't need to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; bipedalism for that.</i><br>
<p>
But not for long periods. The sort of arrangement that allows speedy<br>
quadrupedal gait leaves them basically standing on their toes when on<br>
hind legs only.<br>

<i>&gt;                 &gt;the analytical abilities of hunting were amplified in males</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Scavenging was probably much more important than hunting at this stage.</i><br>
<p>
Bull, maybe for the women, who with their wider flatter hips could not<br>
run as fast or throw as hard as the males, since scavenging for grubs<br>
and roots took less speed or moment arm, but more of an eye for detail.<br>
Even Baboons are differentiating in this area.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;On flat plains with high grass, the higher you can stand,</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;the earlier you get a warning of predators.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you can see a predator better by standing up high, it also means that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; predator can see you better too, and because you're bipedal, the predator is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot faster than you are. If you can't run away from danger a better</i><br>
<i>&gt; strategy would be to hide and keep low.</i><br>
<p>
The point is john is that being higher means you can see him when he is<br>
too far away to do anything to you. This is how the meerkats work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Additionally, the ability to throw rocks and spears with</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;decent power over decent distance also mandates an upright,</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;high stance with a hip structure that also is conducive to</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;bipedalism over quadupedalism. This is a fine example of</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;technology effecting evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But there were no spears, or tools of any sort at that time, ancestors like</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lucy (Australopithecus Afarensis) with their tiny, chimp sized brains were</i><br>
<i>&gt; too dumb to make them. The first very primitive tools were made by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Homo Erectus, an animal with a much larger brain than Lucy, although much</i><br>
<i>&gt; smaller than modern brains. These very early tools do not show up in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fossil record until well over a million years after bipedalism was fully</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed.</i><br>
<p>
Stone tools did not show up, or haven't been found yet (it funny how<br>
dates keep getting pushed farther back all the time). THis does not rule<br>
out tools made from biodegradable materials. You'd be amazed at how much<br>
damage a sharpened bamboo spear can do to an animal, or a wooden arrow,<br>
like that used by montagnard peoples in SE asia or the Kalahari Bush<br>
people.<br>
<p>
Homo Erectus is a good example of a parallel to our present cessation of<br>
development. Once they developed a level of technology sufficent to<br>
provide them with a comfortable living, further evolution was stagnated.<br>
Dr. Leakey has said,"I get so bored with Erectus, that dumb guy was<br>
making the same damn tools for a million and a half years."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;Due to the computational demands of intuitive trajectory</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;calculation, and the  communication demands of hunting in</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;teams or packs, lager brain cases were seen as an</i><br>
<i>&gt;                 &gt;evolutionary  advantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's hard to believe that a pea brain like Lucy could do something that</i><br>
<i>&gt; sophisticated, throwing something accurately is very difficult, it takes a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of brain power. Even modern humans would have a hard time making a living</i><br>
<i>&gt; by throwing baseballs at swiftly moving animals, much less irregular shaped</i><br>
<i>&gt; shaped rocks.</i><br>
<p>
Modern humans do not have to do so. Their next meal no longer depends on<br>
it, which is why the further evolution of the human brain has ceased.<br>
However, if you looked at Pre-TV kids, I'll bet the percentage who could<br>
throw within a strike zone was pretty high.<br>
