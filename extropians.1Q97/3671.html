I disagree. First, uploading will not likely start out as a mental<br>
enhancement, rather as at first as an interesting problem in neuroscience<br>
and then as a radical way of saving a dying person (there is a strong<br>
paralell with cryonics). In this case we are not interested at all in <br>
having a "better" matrix, which would be an invisible level anyway to the <br>
upload, we need a "good enough" matrix able to run the upload. This could <br>
presumably be done using a simple nano-CAM slab as Eugene likes to <br>
propose, or some other massively paralell nanocomputer cluster. Building <br>
such systems are very likely to be among the first applications of <br>
nanotechnology (nanocomputers are practically necessary for creating a <br>
real assembler). <br>
<p>
Being run on a huge pile of Z80s or a quantum dot cellular array would not<br>
make any difference for the upload as long as he or she didn't try to<br>
interact with the outside world (what I would like to call the<br>
"Permutation City Axiom", after Greg Egan's book); what matters is the<br>
user interface - you won't become smarter if your emulated neurons are<br>
emulated in Lisp than in assembler, but if the user interface allows<br>
improved access to information you become effectively smarter. Having fast<br>
hardware is of course desirable, but this is just quantitative improvement<br>
of the basic design. Becoming truly posthuman infomorphs would require<br>
both a good matrix, a great interface to it and other resources and some<br>
remodeling of our minds, a quite complex project. <br>
<p>
Enhancing the brain is not simple (if it was, we would already be doing <br>
it) and nanotechnology will certainly help, but is no panacea. To be able <br>
to improve it we need to understand it throughly (the second precondition <br>
for uploading), at least the relevant parts. Nano-neural interfaces, <br>
coprocessors and other fun stuff would be very useful, and most likely <br>
develop in paralell to uploading (I'm sure there will be a field of <br>
neural nanotechnology, and I plan to work in it) since both need the <br>
technologies and techniques being developed for the other. They <br>
complement each other neatly.<br>
