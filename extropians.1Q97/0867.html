<i>&gt;which spray fuel into the air at the target, using air as the oxidizer -</i><br>
<i>&gt;in most explosives about 70% of the mass is in the oxidizer portion.</i><br>
<p>
Kinetic energy weapons are becoming increasingly popular for military<br>
applications.  There isn't really any way to effectively shield against this<br>
type of attack other than to accept the abuse and then dissipate the energy.<br>
Kinetic energy weapons do not require "special" conditions to function<br>
optimally like virtually all other high energy weapons.<br>
<p>
Fuel/Air Explosives are of limited usefulness.  They CAN be efficient, but<br>
only under the proper conditions.  Under poor conditions, they may not even<br>
work.<br>
BTW, in most explosives, oxidizer is less than 50% of the total mass.<br>
Nitrogen, which is usually responsible for binding the oxygen to the<br>
organics, is responsible for 20-40% of the total mass and does not consume<br>
any oxidizer during detonation.  The most powerful of explosives usually<br>
have the distinction of requiring very little oxidizer due to the high<br>
nitrogen concentrations (&gt;50% mass).  Even compounds often referred to as<br>
"oxidizers" are largely fuel by percent mass.  If you are referring to<br>
composites (like "safe" dynamites), high "oxidizer" levels are required<br>
because most of the oxygen is consumed by the fuel bound in the "oxidizer".<br>

<i>&gt;When the velocity exceeds Earth's escape velocity it becomes more</i><br>
<i>&gt;effective to increase the velocity instead of the mass of the projectile</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the available energy. Using big rocks is lumbering and very slow,</i><br>
<i>&gt;several days to target. However 10kg projectiles at 100km/second only</i><br>
<i>&gt;take 50 minutes; particle beams are even faster, and lasers have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ultimate velocity. A suitable intense laser beam cuts an ionized path</i><br>
<i>&gt;into the atmosphere and is self focussing. Meanwhile, I will just live</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the lunar farside....</i><br>
<p>
Velocity is almost always better.  0.5mv^2...<br>
In the long run, it might just come down to energy efficiency.<br>
