They show what is possible for humans, but not what is possible for a <br>
certain individual.<br>
<p>
One model in "intelligence psychology" is called the reaction range model.<br>
Each human has a certain range of potential intelligence which is more or<br>
less determined by biology (brain wiring, neurotransmittor concentrations,<br>
whatever), but the actual intelligence (which lies in the range) is<br>
determined by the environment and other factors (such as motivation).<br>
According to this model it may exist an individual upper limit to our<br>
(unaided) intelligence. Geniuses both have a very high upper limit and a<br>
high actual intelligence (which may or may not be their full potential). <br>
<p>
I'm not sure I buy the theory, although I think it has some merit. I have<br>
noticed myself that in some areas my personal limits are determined by<br>
"hardware" factors such as the number of waking hours, sensory bandwidth<br>
or span of attention, and this has been tentatively confirmed with a few<br>
psychological tests (guess why I'm so interested in Intelligence<br>
Amplification techniques?). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have no reason to assume that there is anything magically different </i><br>
about the <br>
<i>&gt; geniuses that made them excell.  I think we all have the same basic equipment </i><br>
<i>&gt; and that we can all take it to at least the same level of quality that the </i><br>
<i>&gt; geniuses do.  </i><br>
<p>
I agree with you. When I read accounts about their work, it is rather <br>
clear they do not think much different from most people (with some <br>
exceptions, like Ramanujan), only better. I think most people can train <br>
themselves to reach at least something approaching what we would call <br>
genius today, although by then it would be seen as more or less normal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I also believe that they could have taken their abilities much </i><br>
<i>&gt; further than they did, especially if they had been working together with other </i><br>
<i>&gt; geniuses, for that purpose.</i><br>
<p>
This is an interesting point. How many geniuses have collaborated in the <br>
past? Of course, since they often work and think in highly individual <br>
ways cooperation is hampered, but if similar mental skills could be <br>
widely taught, then (presumably) synergies become more likely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My genius </i><br>
<i>&gt; was created consciously, by perseverence and a lot of hard work, not because </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm "gifted" (except maybe for the fact that I'm the type of person who would </i><br>
<i>&gt; have the ambition and the belief that I could transform myself into a genius).</i><br>
<p>
I think this is very important. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Getting someone to develop that determination and focus is something I'm not </i><br>
<i>&gt; clear how to do, though.  At least not yet.</i><br>
<p>
I think this is the core problem. If it can be solved, then the sky is <br>
the limit. My guess is that we need to learn more about motivation and <br>
how it works to get there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; -- Nothing is too ambitious for an Extropian. --</i><br>

Good slogan!<br>
