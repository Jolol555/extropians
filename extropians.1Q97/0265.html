          In the recent book "Avoiding nuclear anarchy", a group of <br>
          Harvard researches argues that the danger of nuclear <br>
          prolifieration is *the* greatest threat to american national <br>
          security. Especially worrisome is the risk of leakage of <br>
          weapon grade plutonium and uranium, as well as lower grade <br>
          fuel, nuclear related technology and nuclear scientists from <br>
          the former Sovjet Union. The authors claim that though the <br>
          american government has made some attempts to cooperate with <br>
          the Russians to contain this threat, the efforts have not <br>
          been proportionate to the urgency of the situation.<br>
          <br>
          Serious as this may be though, the risk of nuclear leakage <br>
          from the ex-Sovjet is only a minor part of the picture of <br>
          dangers that lay ahead of us. There are other sources for <br>
          nuclear proliferation, there is the risk of proliferation of <br>
          biological and chemical weapons, and there are even greater <br>
          risks in some potential new technology such as <br>
          nanotechnology.<br>
          <br>
          None of this is news, but I bring it up for two reasons. The <br>
          firt reason is that I think that we extropians and <br>
          transhumanists do not consider the risks seriously enough. <br>
          We usually acknowledge their existence, but are not <br>
          generally too worried about them and we do not spend a great <br>
          portion of our time thinking about what we could do about <br>
          them. The explanation is probably that it is *boring*. No <br>
          one wants to be the one who complaints, urges restraint and <br>
          focuses on the negative aspects of things. This is an <br>
          explanation but not an excuse; it would be great if we could <br>
          become more responsible.<br>
          <br>
          Another explanation -and this brings me to the second point <br>
          I want to make- is that many of these problems seem to call <br>
          for solutions that clash with the libertarian doctrine held <br>
          by many on this list. At least at first sight, it seems that <br>
          a reformed and strengthened United Nation would be the best <br>
          suited institution to supervise the use of very dangerous <br>
          technologies. I know the mere mention of the UN probably <br>
          causes some people here to want to throw up. The alternative <br>
          would perhaps be a world where USA plays the international <br>
          big brother role, but this raises many problems of moral <br>
          authority, financing etc. etc. Perhaps it is therefore worth <br>
          considering an institution like the UN in whose decision <br>
          making processes USA and other nations are allowed to play a <br>
          part in the that are in some proportion to their real power. <br>
          If this were to be effective, the UN would of course have to <br>
          have the mandate to make and enforce some laws that would <br>
          prevent any nations, organisations and individuals from <br>
          acquiring weapons of mass distruction or any technologies <br>
          with dangers greater than the group in question could be <br>
          entrusted to handle.<br>
          <br>
          This would mean that some sacrifice of individual freedom <br>
          and national souveigninty would have to be made. But that <br>
          would be a prise worth paying if it would increase the <br>
          chance that mankind succeeds in avoiding putting an end to <br>
          civilization or even its existence as a species. Since we <br>
          have the vision of how fantastic the world could be if the <br>
          forces of possible technologies were released and employed <br>
          wisely, we should also have the will to do what it takes to <br>
          prevent things from going tragically wrong, even if this <br>
          means adding new principles to our thinking that <br>
          circumscribe the applicability of some of our most favoured <br>
          dogmas.<br>
          <br>
          Do you think there is something in this?<br>
          <br>
