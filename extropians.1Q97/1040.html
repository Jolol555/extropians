I know, someone reminded me of it, and i've been looking for more data on<br>
it. zoology data shows that panthera genera (leopard/lion/tiger) didn't<br>
develop until 2.5 million years ago, afarensis is supposed to have been<br>
replaced by habilis then. Recent theories show that various types of<br>
homonids may have overlapped eachother by a lot more time than was assumed<br>
before.<br>
<p>
There are three answers for the specific case of the cave with the<br>
australopiticene skulls. <br>
<p>
1) it were not leopard marks, but acinonyx marks<br>
<p>
2) it were primitve leopard marks, and lucy's kind lived longer than assumed<br>
<p>
3) the zoology data about panthera species is incorrect.<br>
<p>
Whatever it was (i'd go for 1 or 2), i do seem to recall the paleontologist<br>
who showed the specific skull in the documantary ('in search of our<br>
ancestors', i had it on tape, but can't find it back) suggested it had been<br>
an older afarensis or that it was cought in some swamp or something to that<br>
extent.<br>
<p>
In any case it's more than a little remarkable that there is so few data<br>
about a possible big cat ancestor who could have hunted the occasional<br>
afarensis. I needed that data to establish the relative treath to afarensis<br>
it could have posed. But the example of the chimps in my previous posting<br>
shows that whatever risk it was, it was not as big as John Clarke suggested.<br>
As i said before, any big cat who lived around lucys time, can not be<br>
compared to modern big cats, there's a 4 million year period of development<br>
and natural selection between them. And other data has suggested that<br>
afarensis was quite capable of defending himself against predators. Therefore <br>
afarensis did have a predator, but a predator who prefered an easier prey.<br>
<p>
In any case Afarensis was definitely not 'main course' on the menu of<br>
whatever proto- big cat lived in the same period. And that wasn't how it was<br>
described by previous posters on the subject.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;&gt; Maybe the only real competition of importance to Afarensis (and &gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; This might explain the much faster evolution (intelligence increase, body</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; size etc) of homonids compared to most other species.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Which brings us to the most likely theory regarding the latter phases </i><br>

<i>&gt;human form to some physiological limit once they started throwing stones</i><br>
<i>&gt;and/or words/protowords at each other on a regular basis.</i><br>
<p>

<i>&gt;troublesome either way.  Without large carnivourous land predators, </i><br>
<i>&gt;"chimps throwing rocks" are pretty much on top of the food chain and so</i><br>
<i>&gt;"the evasion of predators", one of the big calling cards behind the </i><br>
<i>&gt;"wading ape theory" takes a big loss.  Still the diving reflex, fur-</i><br>
<i>&gt;lessness, salt metabolism, subcutaneous fat, and newborn swimming </i><br>
<i>&gt;ability (to the extent that these things hold up factually) do seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be better explained this way than otherwise.  Seems like the mystery</i><br>
<i>&gt;of this earlier phase only deepens.</i><br>
 <br>
I've downloaded over 100 postings in the paleontology newsgroups that dealt<br>
with predators and aquatic ape theory. All of them spoke of a catlike<br>
predator (mostly mistaking lions and leopards for having been around at the<br>
time) but none of them supplied the name of the creature. I'm 90% sure any<br>
predecessor of panthera genera couldn't have been around at lucy's time, and<br>
if it was, it was in its infancy, far from the maneater modern lions and<br>
leopards are.<br>
<p>
All cats developed from civet genera (hyeanas as well), they developed from<br>
a creature one and a half times the size of a modern house cat to what they<br>
are today. Any big cat that developed before the main group of big cats<br>
(panthera) must have been acynonix genera.<br>
<p>
***The one thing i may have overlooked is that panthera genera probably<br>
developed from a large species of proto-acinonyx. So at best we have a<br>
transitional acinonyx-panthera at lucy's time (again: of which there doesn't<br>
seem to be any name or data).<br>
<p>
The last remaining acinonyx is the cheetah (a. jubatus), some info on the<br>
cheetah:   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Cheetahs aren't good hunters either. Even though they can run very fast,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they can only do so for a short period of time, so they have to get very</i><br>
<i>&gt;close to their prey in order to have a chance of catching it. Many young</i><br>
<i>&gt;cheetahs make the mistake of starting their attack too soon and get tired</i><br>
<i>&gt;before they catch it. Once they catch their prey, they aren't good at</i><br>
<i>&gt;defending it either. Often cheetahs are so exhausted from chasing their</i><br>
<i>&gt;food, they can't even protect it from being taken by hyenas.</i><br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Cheetah's don't have sharp claws. Cheetah's claws don't retract all the way</i><br>
<i>&gt;like other cat's claws do, this is to help them keep from slipping at high</i><br>
<i>&gt;speeds, because of this, their claws are dull and more like dog's claws.</i><br>
<p>
Any proto species of acinonyx which lead to the panthera genera must have<br>
been something between a primitive cheetah and a primitive lion/leopard.<br>
Note: not a cross between a MODERN cheetah and a MODERN lion, but at best a<br>
cross between an underdeveloped cheetah and an underdeveloped lion. Lacking<br>
4 million years of rapidly upward spiraling natural selection.   <br>
<p>
Any comparison made between afarensis and this proto big cat, would sooner<br>
be a comparison between modern man and modern big cat, than between a chimp<br>
and a leopard. And even chimps have shown they can handle a leopard !<br>
<p>
I hope my point is taken.<br>
<p>
As to aquatic ape theory, i don't support it, but i don't ignore their<br>
criticism either, it's an interesting theory which is worth thinking about.<br>
The problem with AAT supporters is that what they accuse their opponents of<br>
-being stuck in dogma- reflects to some of them as well. What i don't like<br>
is the ease with which generalizations are made in comparing modern<br>
creatures with prehistoric animals. I've done it too in my recent posts, but<br>
i've always added comment that it should not be forgotten its not the same<br>
species we're talking about, but a modern, better developed version. <br>
<p>
Even assuming that the data about panthera genera is incorrect, the fact<br>
that 4 million years of development has gone by makes a big difference. If<br>
prehistroic big cats are only a fragment underdeveloped compared to modern<br>
big cats, of what afarensis is compared to modern man, i would still summon<br>
up Afarensis like this: <br>
<p>
He was the most intelligent creature that lived, well capable not only of<br>
defending himself aginst even the most ferocious MODERN predators, but not<br>
affraid of them, and killing it's young whenever it could. <br>
