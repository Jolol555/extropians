<i>&gt; Nice try, but you're seeing the "system by whatever name" from the inside,</i><br>
<i>&gt; whereas I am seeing it from the outside to my advantage. For example, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are expressing by quoting sentiments such as the above you are doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; stirring almost patriotic fervor. Someone would think that you view money</i><br>
<i>&gt; as an actual finite resource not to be wasted or loose value. Heck, if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who print it for a fee thought it was valuable wouldn't they be</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to keep its value up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are new ways of finding communication value other than in price, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that don't jeopardize safety. (which I trust is of paramount value to this</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion)</i><br>
<p>
#1 I haven't heard you state any reasonable alternatives to price<br>
signals.<br>
#2 Who or what's safety is jeopardized by price signals?<br>
<p>
#3 Given there are a finite nuber of people on this planet, each with a<br>
finite number of hours in the day to do work, and with a finite level<br>
of  skills, as well as with a finite amount of resources to apply those<br>
skills and hours to to increase or add value, it is obvious that there<br>
would be a finite source of money. To think otherwise would be to risk<br>
the sort of chaotic insanity seen in the "print more if we run out"<br>
attitude of the idiots running formerly communist states like Russia,<br>
who have no concept of rational economic management.<br>
<p>
#4 The fact that our money does not need to be tied to  a fixed value of<br>
a resource like gold or silver anymore is evidence that it has attained<br>
value in and of itself as a symbol of productive value of people,<br>
machines, and resources. The actions of the Fed here in the US, and<br>
other national banks elsewhere to maintain the stability of the money<br>
supply is for three reasons: 1) because since cash is mostly in a form<br>
that wears out (the average paper dollar bill has an average life of<br>
less than one year, due to its flimsiness) they need to track its flow<br>
and maintain a healthy supply of said forms of money. 2) Because people<br>
as individuals change their productive and consumptive behavior over<br>
time. 3) Because resources relative scarcity changes over time in<br>
response to the opening and closing of markets and resource bases to<br>
exploitation due to both politics and price signal (for example, due to<br>
the end of the cold war, Russia is now the largest producer and exporter<br>
of petroleum in the world. Adding their resource base in this area has<br>
greatly contributed to the decline in energy costs to what is now the<br>
lowest relative energy resource costs in recorded human history. They<br>
have also contributed to historically low metals prices, and are helping<br>
to make up for the impact of recent lumbering restrictions here in the<br>
US on the market prices for wood products.)<br>
<p>
I HIGHLY recommend that you first take a few REAL courses in economics<br>
before you go spouting off about its supposed obsolescence.<br>
