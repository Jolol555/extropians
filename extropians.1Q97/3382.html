Pat, <br>
<p>
Not exactly a Nature article, but suggestive nonetheless.  Might I ask, why<br>
are you so into this?  I thought Duesberg had a point too, until I started<br>
looking into it.  There's a terrific book you should read by a woman AIDS<br>
journalist that kind of blasts all sides of the AIDS debate, she's from<br>
Florida, I can't remember her name, but I'll try to find the reference, the<br>
next time I go to the library.  <br>

2/ 4: Twists and Turns in Chimp AIDS Research<br>
<p>
By DAVID BERREBY<br>
<p>
<p>
  It was not easy for scientists to decide to use chimpanzees for AIDS<br>
research back in the 1980s. But as much as they hesitated to give the animals<br>
a fatal disease, researchers believed that they could console themselves with<br>
two thoughts: the chimpanzee would turn out to be a useful model for human<br>
AIDS, and the animals would come down with the disease soon after being<br>
infected, and thus would not suffer long. <br>
<p>
  Both assumptions turned out to be wrong. Years passed, grants expired and<br>
still the HIV-infected chimps did not come down with AIDS. Researchers<br>
shifted to other animals. <br>
<p>
  Meanwhile, confined to windowless quarters and attended by caretakers in<br>
biocontainment "spacesuits," the chimps spent year after year living under<br>
conditions that were only supposed to last two or three years. Just last<br>
year, for instance, the Yerkes Regional Primate Center in Atlanta installed<br>
windows in the building where it keeps its HIV-infected chimpanzees. <br>
<p>
  Now, nearly 13 years after the first infection of a chimp with HIV, one has<br>
died and a few others are sick, apparently from AIDS. Jerom, a 13-year-old<br>
male who was first infected in 1985, died early last year at Yerkes. Another<br>
chimp at Yerkes, a male named Nathan, received a transfusion of Jerom's blood<br>
before the first ape's death. <br>
<p>
  "We're certainly studying the effects on Nathan on a virological and<br>
immunological basis, and possibly looking at other chimps as well," said Dr.<br>
Frank Noviembre, a biologist who does AIDS research at Yerkes. "It's going to<br>
be interesting to look at what happened to Jerom and what's happening in<br>
Nathan and what possibly is happening in other chimps and try to correlate<br>
that with humans." <br>
<p>
  HIV isolated from Jerom's blood was introduced into two more chimpanzees<br>
three months ago, one by injection and the other by application to her<br>
cervix. They have shown a steady decline in CD-4 blood cells, the immune<br>
cells that are attacked by the AIDS virus, said Dr. Patricia Fultz, a<br>
professor of microbiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who is<br>
conducting the study. Two more chimps will be infected anally within the<br>
month, Dr. Fultz said. The purpose of the experiment, she said, is to develop<br>
a model of how HIV is acquired through different mucous membranes, which will<br>
be used to test and evaluate the effectiveness of possible vaccines. <br>
<p>
  Some AIDS researchers are focusing on factors that make the virus more<br>
easily transmitted. For example, a recent paper by Dr. Preston Marx, based on<br>
work done in monkeys at a Westchester County research laboratory owned by New<br>
York University Medical School, suggests that vaginal transmission of the<br>
virus is enhanced by progesterone, a hormone whose synthetic version is used<br>
in birth control pills. Such work on methods of transmission might be another<br>
area in which chimps could prove useful to researchers. <br>
<p>
  "I think we can use long-term infected animals," Dr. Fultz said. <br>
<p>
  Not all researchers are convinced that Jerom died of human AIDS, but<br>
"there's a strong possibility that the consensus will shift," said Dr. Marx,<br>
who is director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York. "There<br>
is at least a variant of HIV-1 that is causing an AIDS-like disease in<br>
chimpanzees," Dr. Marx said. "The question becomes, How different is that<br>
strain from the human strain?" The chance that larger numbers of chimpanzees<br>
could once again be used in AIDS research "has emerged," he said, "where a<br>
year ago that possibility did not exist." <br>
<p>
  The prospect that some or all of the country's 150 to 200 HIV-infected<br>
chimpanzees will come down with AIDS raises a host of ethical questions. How<br>
much care, for example, should an AIDS-inflicted chimp receive? Should the<br>
animal be given AZT or protease inhibitors? At what stage of suffering, if at<br>
all, is euthanasia appropriate? If chimps with AIDS live on for decades, who<br>
will support them? <br>
<p>
  "It's a problem of economics more than anything," explained Noviembre, who<br>
said that he had not made up his mind about the question of euthanasia. <br>
<p>
  "If you have these chimps that are not progressing to disease," and another<br>
strain of HIV is available that scientists want to test, Noviembre said, "but<br>
you have no other building, well, should you not do that research because you<br>
won't euthanize the chimps you have?" <br>
<p>
  He said: "When I first presented some of our results last year at a<br>
conference, I was talking to a guy from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and he said,<br>
you realize you've opened a big can of worms because the NIH is about to say<br>
chimps aren't needed in AIDS research? I said, I know, but what can we do,<br>
really? We're just reporting what we're finding." <br>
