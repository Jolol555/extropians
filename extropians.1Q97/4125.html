<p>
You cannot simply program emotions if the hardware cannot experience<br>
them. My body including my brain can experience emotions. Computers, as<br>
of yet, cannot experience emotions, and this is not so much a software<br>
problem as it is a hardware problem. Thus, to further articulate my<br>
statement:<br>
<p>
Until there becomes an interest in developing the necessary "hardware"<br>
to enable computers to experience feelings and emotions [felt<br>
sensations] then uploading will remain somewhat of a ludic concept to<br>
me. Once I am uploaded in a computer, if I cannot experience<br>
emotions/feelings, then there really isn't any reason for me to continue<br>
existing.<br>
<p>
You can program to your hearts content for a thousand millinium, but if<br>
you don't create the proper hardware or peripheals, computers will never<br>
be able to experience emotions. It is extremely naive to think that you<br>
can simply program emotions, as if some scientist could suddenly program<br>
his Pentium 200 to enjoy data-processing.   <br>
<p>
Without emotions there is no happiness, appreciation, joy, thrill,<br>
ectsasy, exhileration, sadness, adventure, etcetera. Without emotion<br>
there is no reason for me to exist. <br>

Explore and play!<br>
