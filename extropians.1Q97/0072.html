From: Lyle Burkhead &lt;LYBRHED@delphi.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Anyway I was kidding about the stock market going up exponentially.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; This was supposed to be an absurd fantasy to get the new year off to a </i><br>
<i>&gt; humorous start.  </i><br>
<p>
My mailer somehow deleted about 50 messages yesterday, so I never saw<br>
Lyle's humorous message.  But at the risk of redundancy I'll repeat an<br>
argument I made here several years ago for why we should see a stock<br>
market explosion.<br>
<p>
The question is, what is the price a stock will have in a market where all<br>
participants are rational?  Economists have many theories for everything,<br>
of course, but one of the most accepted theories for stock price is<br>
based on "discounted future returns".<br>
<p>
The idea is that the benefit of stock ownership comes down to dividends.<br>
This may seem surprising today when we think of spectacularly performing<br>
IPO's where stock holders make a lot of money even though the prospects<br>
for dividends are pretty uncertain.  The theory is that ultimately<br>
these companies are expected to be producing dividends, big dividends,<br>
because of their rapid growth rates.  Eventually they will move into the<br>
"cash cow" phase of their growth cycle and exploit their market dominance<br>
to produce huge payoffs for investors.<br>
<p>
The problem then is that most of the dividends which ownership of a given<br>
stock will provide are off in the future (even if it is paying dividends<br>
now).  So what you need to do is to discount the future income from the<br>
stock by your personal interest rate, which will generally be about the<br>
same as current market rates.  Getting $100 next year is worth less to you<br>
than getting $100 this year, perhaps by a few percent.<br>
<p>
You then form an infinite sum, adding each estimated future dividend<br>
multiplied by the discount rate appropriate for that distance in the<br>
future.  This gives you the total discounted future return for the stock,<br>
and that, according to this model, would be the stock's value for you.<br>
Average this over all market participants and you get the stock price.<br>
<p>
Now consider how this model works as we approach an era where industrial<br>
production grows explosively, due to nanotech, or AI, or self-reproducing<br>
cheap robots, or some other breakthrough. This can cause returns from the<br>
stock to begin increasing at a rapid rate, even faster than the discount<br>
factor reduces them.  The result could be that the infinite sum above<br>
diverges!  The stock will in fact, today, have an infinite value to you.<br>
<p>
Right now not many people would believe this reasoning.  But as we<br>
approach a singularity era, and more and more people start to sense<br>
"great things just beyond the horizon", it will become more accepted that<br>
owning productive resources is going to be the ticket to future wealth<br>
beyond imagining.  Stocks and other productive assets will become<br>
overwhelmingly attractive.  We will see a sudden transition to a regime<br>
where everyone expends all other resources to buy stocks.  The result<br>
would be a one-time transition, an explosion in stock prices.<br>
<p>
This would not be a conventional speculative bubble, where people invest<br>
just to get temporary gains from the ongoing price rises, but rather a<br>
long-term transition.  These are "buy and hold" investors, putting every<br>
spare penny into stocks.  And assuming the productivity explosion occurs<br>
as expected, all these people could end up being very happy with their<br>
investment.<br>
<p>
I would expect the financial explosion to occur a few years to perhaps a<br>
few decades before the productivity explosion, depending on how farsighted<br>
investors are.  Obviously political factors will be relevant too; if stocks<br>
are nationalized then ownership will be irrelevant.  But the huge returns<br>
possible can tolerate even a considerable degree of uncertainty in how<br>
likely they are to occur.<br>
<p>
So actually a stock market explosion is not such a far fetched<br>
possibility.  I doubt that we'll see it next year, though!  But keep it<br>
in mind when you make your own financial plans.<br>
<p>
