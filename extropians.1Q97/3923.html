<i>&gt; If inventors produced intellectual property at the same rate as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; production worker produced cars, we would obviously need to make this</i><br>
<i>&gt; comparison. Unfortunately, inventions are rare beasts, coming few and</i><br>
<i>&gt; far between, after much research, thought, and study. The writer has</i><br>
<i>&gt; obviously never invented a thing, or he would realize that while the</i><br>
<i>&gt; breakthrough "Eureka" may be momentary, there is a long series of hours,</i><br>
<i>&gt; days, and weeks spent preparing the mind to make such acheivements.</i><br>
<p>
In the treatise I am writing on the subject, this is what I call "The<br>
Myth of the Lone Inventor", a cultural image that tends to mystify the<br>
work of creation and justify our subsides of it.  Existing IP monopolies<br>
contribute to the myth, because they prevent all the minor tweaks and<br>
improvements that would be the natural evolution of any design from<br>
coming to market.  It is only when a particular tweak is recognizable<br>
and distinct enough to make calling it an "invention" plausible that<br>
we grant it the monopoly, thereby discouraging futher development.  In<br>
a free economy of ideas, 99% of inventions would be minor tweaks on<br>
existing things, and the research itself would be cheap, and entry to<br>
the market would be cheap, and everyone--inventors included--would be<br>
too busy getting rich to bother filing for patents.<br>
<p>
The occurence of a truly new and spectacular idea from nothing is a rare<br>
and wonderful event--Newton's gravity, Darwin's evolution, and Einstein's<br>
general relativity are the only ones I can think of, but practical<br>
inventions are a dime a dozen.  Each of us has several ideas a day for an<br>
improvement to an existing product.  The reason they don't get developed<br>
is that entry to the market is made difficult by regulation, including<br>
patents.  That copyrights and patents are not needed to stimulate creative<br>
invention is evidenced by the fact that the three gentlemen above didn't<br>
need it.  Gutenberg's press was a nifty idea, building upon a foundation<br>
of countless other inventions that came before.  He needed no patents to<br>
become a wealthy man, and to instigate flourishing publishing businesses<br>
from the late 1500s through the 1700s without copyrights.<br>
<p>
Mr. Lorrey dismisses his opponent as "obviously not an inventor", which<br>
conveniently ignores the fact that he is in fact a writer, and we are<br>
talking about copyrights and patents.  And I /am/ an inventor.  Maybe<br>
I haven't found a way around conservation of momentum yet, but I have<br>
written software for 15 years, much of which would certainly be patentable<br>
if I cared to (PNG's adaptive pre-filtering compression algorithm, for<br>
example) and most of which is copyrihted by my employers.  But I cannot<br>
in clear conscience name a single measurable benefit either I or my<br>
employers gained from a copyright or patent that is not outweighed <br>
tenfold by the crippling effects on research, gradual development, and<br>
wasted litigation cause by IP law.<br>
