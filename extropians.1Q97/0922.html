I looked it up. <br>
<p>
The only big cats around at the time of Australopithecus (4-5 million years<br>
- 2.5 mln years ago) were various Smilodon, (the sabertooth) but he only<br>
lived in north and south america, and the most dangerous type (fatalis - the<br>
one always shown), didn't show up until 2.5 mln years ago). <br>
<p>
And species of Acinonyx, cheetah-like cats, who could have formed some<br>
danger for the Lucy's kind (nothing like modern Lions or Tigers), but<br>
remember please John, Smilodon an his kind also had brain volumes much lower<br>
than todays tigers, lions and cheetahs, compared to these, they were what<br>
lucy is compared to modern man - stupid !   <br>
<p>
All species evolve, homonids have, but so have their prey and their<br>
predators. Putting a prehistoric homonid up against predators who you give<br>
the qualities of their modern equivalents, is more than a little unfair.<br>
<p>
Lions didn't develop until 2.5 mln years ago, and therefore came around the<br>
same time as homo erectus. <br>
<p>
I didn't find out the speed and body weigth of some of the Acinonyx, or<br>
wether they hunted alone or in packs. I assume they will have preyed on the<br>
occasional Australopithecus, but i don't think they can be compared to<br>
modern big cats.<br>
