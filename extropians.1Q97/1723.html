[I said:]<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We need *one* QC Cray to calculate protein foldings or evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; computation, and then we're home free.  Ubiquitous QC seems unlikely,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not on grounds of expense, but on the grounds that a single KQb</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (kiloqubit) will probably be enough to revolutionize the world beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; where "ubiquitous" has any meaning.</i><br>
[Saith Anders Sandburg:]<br>
<i>&gt; LOL! I'm going to remember that you said this, Eliezer! This sounds </i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly like the classic "The world market for computers will be around </i><br>
<i>&gt; eight of them".</i><br>
<p>
Well, I didn't mean it that way:  I meant one KQb could be substantially<br>
beyond the Singularity threshold, after which all conscious entities<br>
might merge and "tools" no longer perceived as discrete objects, in<br>
which case "ubiquitous" might not make any sense.<br>
<p>
[Anders continues:]<br>
<i>&gt; And besides, in a posthuman world QC might be the </i><br>
<i>&gt; matrix of choice, every little godling runs on them.</i><br>
<p>
Could be... even post-Singularity, the logic seems as strong as ever: <br>
Why waste the uncounted counterfactual branches of reality when they<br>
could be performing useful work?  Assuming we can't (or don't want to)<br>
rewrite the laws of physics, continued QC does seem very probable.<br>
<p>
Also,<br>
<i>&gt; I seriously doubt just one KQb will revolutionize the world; once you </i><br>
<i>&gt; start doing useful things with them (folding proteins, cracking PGP, </i><br>
<i>&gt; finding messages in Pi etc.) </i><br>
<p>
Finding messages in Pi?  Why would QC help?  Last time I checked the<br>
most efficient way of finding pi was a continuing approximation; an<br>
equation which, each time you ran the current approximation through,<br>
added another 14 digits of precision.  (It was revolutionary because<br>
previously, you needed to add up a lot of fractions and decide the<br>
precision in advance.)  It seems like an entirely linear computation.<br>
