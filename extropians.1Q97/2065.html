The definition of local in relativity theory IS and ONLY IS:<br>
<p>
  s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ict)^2,   x, y, z, and t all being real.<br>
<p>
All pairs of spacetime points that don't obey this equation have either<br>
a spacelike or a timelike separation and thus by definition are non-local.<br>
<p>
Granted that relativity allows the propagation of causality along timelike<br>
paths, but that is because the world-lines of particles that have mass carry<br>
the particles themselves on timelike vectors through 4-space thus producing<br>
the more common-sense form of locality.  A sense of locality that arises <br>
because particles are essentially changing their spacetime location from our<br>
human perspective.<br>
<p>
None of this applies to photons and other particles that travel on light-like<br>
vectors.  For these particles, the definition of locality is the spacetime in-<br>
terval described by the above formula (or some mathematically equivalent form).<br>

<p>
This is FALSE.  A locally causal temporally bidirectional microcausality would<br>
allow violation of Bell's inequality just fine.  This temporally bidirectional<br>
microcausality is a standard feature of both Maxwell's equations and is a starting<br>
requirement for all relativistically correct forms of QM even if the details<br>
have yet to be fully worked through.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even if we someday find a better theory than Quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mechanics, any successful theory must explain that experimental result.</i><br>
<p>
Nothing needs to be explained.  It is a problem that springs solely from the<br>
fact that our monkey brains have a default definition of locality that is <br>
neither relativistically accurate nor takes into account the backward in time<br>
principle of advanced-action where it should.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; If Cramer claims that his theory is local then he is also claiming that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is untrue, however I have never heard him say anything like that, instead he</i><br>
<i>&gt; talks about everyday events "shaking hands with the universe", and as I said</i><br>
<i>&gt; before, that's about as non-local as you can get.</i><br>
<p>
Again, it only seems non-local when one assumes that micro-causality is <br>
unidirectional with respect to time.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Again, this is a much deeper paradox in relativity than the twins</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;business, a paradox that QM patches up in a consistent manner.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One reason we know that we still have a lot to learn is that the 2 giant</i><br>
<i>&gt; pillars of modern Physics, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics have</i><br>
<i>&gt; little in common, until Hawking's work 30 years ago they had nothing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; common. We still have a long way to go before we have a Quantum Theory of</i><br>
<i>&gt; gravity, and gravity is General Relativity's strong point.</i><br>
<p>
In this we are agreed, we do have a long way to go with this.<br>
