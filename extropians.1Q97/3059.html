Having missed out on contribution to the "Anarcho-Capitalism Stability"<br>
thread due to work pressures, I thought I'd toss in a couple of comments<br>
here:<br>
<p>
In a message dated 97-02-27 19:12:51 EST, John Blanco-Losada writes:<br>

<p>
Except at the extremes, personal freedom is a matter of degree.  I think<br>
individuals are more or less free, not either/or.  Thus my personal "liberty<br>
meter" can register a higher degree of freedom in some societies than others<br>
and in different "axes", i.e. in some countries I am more free to do one sort<br>
of thing, and in others more free to do others.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Do you feel that a libertarian society can be realized by working within </i><br>
<i>&gt;  the political system to change existing governments, or do you feel that </i><br>
<i>&gt;  such a society can only be realized by starting fresh from scratch?</i><br>
<p>
I think T0Morrow's comments in the "Anarcho-Capitalism Stability" thread are<br>
very apt in answer to this: There are many fronts on which the sphere of<br>
personal liberty can be enlarged using existing tools of polycentric law in<br>
many currently existing societies, especially the U.S.  Depending on the<br>
extent to which one is a "minarchist" or a radical anarchist, it may well be<br>
possible to realize a society of maximal personal liberty by gradually<br>
enlarging the sphere of personal liberty.  <br>
<p>
One problem with this approach in the U.S. is that, while the federal<br>
constitution defines (at least in theory) the central national government as<br>
a limited sovereign, the constitutions of the states do not.  In theory, the<br>
U.S. states are "ultimate soveregns" claiming all residual political power.<br>
 Thus -- again in theory -- a gradualist approach will ultimately bump up<br>
against a limit to individual liberty in the sovereign power of the states.<br>
 A successful program of gradualism, however, might approach this limit so<br>
gently, though, that by the time it is reached, cultural expectations of<br>
persoal liberty could be great enough that the "ultimate sovereign" might<br>
"wither away" peacefully, with a wink and a nod.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Would you "put your money where your mouth is" and actually move to a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  libertarian colony?</i><br>
<p>
This question has been discussed before, with some acute insights from Robin<br>
Hanson, if memory serves.  The problem is one of relative benefit and cost.<br>
 Immigration to a "new society" will have costs associated with it for<br>
specific individuals.  The more economically and socially established and<br>
successful an individual is in the "old world", the less favorable an<br>
immigration decision will be.  Likewise, the more economic opportunity and<br>
liberty is available in an "old world" society, the less favorable an<br>
immigration decision will be.  A review of the character of phases of<br>
immigration to North America reflects these factors starkly.<br>
<p>
In practical terms, these factors mean that the new "libertarian colony" has<br>
to offer significant relative advantages to entice immigrants from the "old<br>
world".  They also mean that the immigration decision will be evaluated<br>
differently for differently-situated inhabitants of any specific "old world"<br>
society.  The paradox is that some of the people that a "brave new<br>
(libertarian) world" will want most to attract are the ones with the highest<br>
threshhold to overcome in this equation.<br>
<p>
Thus, the answer to the question is, "it depends".  For a young person with<br>
few roots in the old world, living in a repressive society with few<br>
opportunities, immigration is relatively easy.  For a succesfully established<br>
person living in a relatively free society with good economic prospects, the<br>
decision is harder.  <br>
<p>
Factors that would act as immigration "magnets" certainly relate to legal<br>
advantage and the availability of new resources.  Thus a luxurious tax haven<br>
built in the asteroid belt sounds pretty good to me.  A "colony" consisting<br>
of some dilapidated structures in a Third World country doesn't.<br>
