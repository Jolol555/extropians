}         What kind of democracy would you fight: the ideological form or the<br>
} current American political form...they are vastly different.<br>
<p>
I thought I'd take this opportunity to throw out one of my wacky ideas<br>
again.<br>
<p>
Since it seems likely that we need _some_ government, to regulate<br>
necessary non-local interactions (pollution, other public bane/public<br>
good problems) and to make necessary but arbitrary decisions (which side<br>
of the road to drive on), we still need to think about what form of<br>
gov't to have, and representative legislatures still seem the best bet.<br>
It's more convenient to have a small group decide things than a large<br>
one, and the subset of people can devote more time to studying the<br>
issues than the whole population would.<br>
<p>
But our current system doesn't satisfy that very well.  PC or not PC, I<br>
don't think that it can be argued that a bunch of mostly white male rich<br>
lawyer-politicians is an accurate cross-section of the nation.  This<br>
could be justified in 18th century thought on the grounds that those<br>
people might be better qualified to make decisions than the populace --<br>
implying that the people can judge qualifications to judge better than<br>
they can judge in general, but never mind that.<br>
<p>
However, I doubt most people (let alone the ones on this list) have that<br>
much respect for their extant legislators.  More theoretically, it is<br>
not clear why they should have superior powers of mind; most obviously<br>
they are selected for the ability to get elected.  One would hope that<br>
their electorate was judging them by the ability to make good decisions,<br>
but in fact considerations of pork obtained, seniority, and sheer amount<br>
of advertising seem to be the main factors.  And they don't even have<br>
that much time to devote to studying, as raising money is a large<br>
concern.<br>
<p>
So if our current system seems to lack any of the virtues it should<br>
have, what could replace it?  The simplest way to get a representative<br>
cross-section of the population is to select a few hundred to a thousand<br>
people at random.  This would rarely be an exact representation, but it<br>
should be much closer and more reliable than our current legislatures.<br>
They would not, of course, be any more qualified than the whole<br>
population, but since we are supposedly a democratic nation this doesn't<br>
seem to be a philosophical problem, and I've alread assumed that no one<br>
believes the winners of elections are all that qualified either.  And,<br>
as the representatives have no election to worry about, they have no<br>
need to spend time raising money, and less need to be beholden to<br>
lobbies; "big money" would have much less influence.  Admittedly without<br>
re-election the only constraints on them to do a good job are their own<br>
consciences and whatever media attention each gets, but I'm willing to<br>
risk the trade-off.<br>
<p>
This also provides a better justification than habit from the House of<br>
Lords and the Senate for having an upper house; one term's crop of the<br>
lower house, or a random subset thereof, can be retained for the next<br>
term's upper house, to provide some experience and continuity and a<br>
brake on silly legislation.  WIth 500+ legislators the change of a<br>
skewed house is small; getting a bad skew two terms in a row,<br>
particularly the _same_ skew, is even more unlikely.<br>
<p>
This can be fine-tuned of course, but the basic idea is that the current<br>
unrepresentative legislatures, selected for campaigning ability and<br>
access to money, should be replaced with large pools of randomly<br>
selected people, which should be no less qualified, cheaper, and<br>
possibly less corrupt.<br>
<p>
(Key sidepoint: lots of media attention on the selection process<br>
itself.)<br>
