<p>
Not at all. You really aren't thinking this through. using 10% more<br>
energy puts the object through the L1 point and into earth's gavity<br>
well. Also, considering the value of the L1 point, it would be silly to<br>
not build the capability to send materials there. Also, say the lunar<br>
govt as a prerevolutionary corporate cabal decides to build a launcher<br>
on the FAR side, ostensibly to be able to send materials to L1 for a<br>
station being built there. The far side launcher is immune to direct<br>
attack by earth, except by slow trajecotries that are detectable (less<br>
than 100 miles above the surface) on the near side, so the energy<br>
applied is much less, and building in a big crater that has a good rim<br>
is a fortress setup.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Since luna does not NEED to attack earth, the onus will be on earth to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; attack first. This puts earth gov't in a poor PR position, where they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will have to fabricate some terrorist bombing or something to rouse up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; public sentiment to support their inhumane actions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the lunies threaten to attack Earth, then you can guarantee that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth governments will react. Anyway, we all know that a short war is good</i><br>
<i>&gt; for your ratings; Bush proved that in the Gulf and Margaret Thatcher</i><br>
<i>&gt; improved her position substantially after the Falklands War, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; resulted in a much larger loss of men and machinery.</i><br>
<p>
So what is your point? Like I said, in order for earthgov to publicly<br>
justify and get good PR for support of an attack on luna, the lunies<br>
would HAVE to attack first, so as long as they don't the earthgov would<br>
look tyrranical to do so or must fabricate evidence (Gulf of Tonkin<br>
Incident).<br>
<p>
Now here's an additional argument why earthgov would WANT luna to be<br>
independent: Forcible exile of prisoners or welfarees would constitute a<br>
violation of human rights under the UN charter, so any earthgov doing so<br>
would have to be able to keep Luna free of the legal restrictions of the<br>
WOrld COurt (if its only the "World" court, then they can't do anything<br>
about what happens on Luna.) SO once people are on the moon, they can't<br>
do anything about it.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You were projecting the use of a propulsin system so efficient that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; could accelerate constantly at above one G from the earth to the moon?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No, he's assuming 11km/s from Earth orbit, AFAIR. That's not terribly</i><br>
<i>&gt; realistic, but possible in a future where you can afford to run a lunar</i><br>
<i>&gt; colony.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And an easily detectable military mobilization in orbit will be seen to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be as much of a threat by any non allied nations on earth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Like the UN-sponsored buildup in the Gulf? Yes, the locals didn't like it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but they put up with it for long enough to retake Kuwait.</i><br>
<p>
And in the meantime, they are outside earth jurisdiction, so lunies can<br>
cause all sorts of havoc. Additionally, Kuwait is a different situation.<br>
There you had a sovreign state invaded from the outside. On Luna you<br>
have the people exercising their UN recognised right of self<br>
determination. Can't hardly bitch about that, can you?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In addition, the logistical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; costs of putting earth resources in orbit (since they won't be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; get them from the moon) add additional expense to such an endeavor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even today, putting a few nukes and boosters in orbit will only cost you a</i><br>
<i>&gt; billion or two. In a future where you can support a million people on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; moon that will probably be more like millions.</i><br>
<p>
Oh you are so casual about it. The corporate way of doing it for a<br>
profit are MARKEDLY different from the government way or the military<br>
way. NASA takes 100,000 people to launch one rocket, while independent<br>
launch companies use less than 100 to do the same job.<br>
<p>
Also, the company that develops cost effective propulsion for such a<br>
colony is NOT going to share it with NASA or any ohter competitor, so<br>
the cost factors are completely different.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You don't really understand the magnitude of what you are saying. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; took $60 billion in equipment losses and expenses operating a trillion</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dollars in equipment with the cooperation of over a dozen nations to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mount a successful 8 day campaign here ON EARTH to recover 100 square</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; miles of desert wasteland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Note *recover*... we don't care about recovering your colony, we just</i><br>
<i>&gt; disable or destroy it and tidy up afterwards. Also, of course, a few nukes</i><br>
<i>&gt; dropped on Iraq and Kuwait would have ended the war quickly, probably for</i><br>
<i>&gt; less than a billion dollars (unless you lost some stealth bombers in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; process). The US chose to do things the expensive way for PR purposes.</i><br>
<p>
And how do you think things will change in a luna scenario? rather<br>
hypocritical. I think that your claims are rather specious given<br>
people's aversion to using nukes. You really have NO IDEA of the ruckus<br>
such a strategy will raise on earth. Additionally, people on earth and<br>
in the US will have relatives on Luna and wont be happy at all with<br>
abandonment of their families. You really are rather blinkered.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There is a HUGE differential in the costs that a defender must incur vs</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the attacker to win a confrontation. Here on earth the differential can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be as much as 1 to 100.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We don't care, because all the attacks on the moon are by machines, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we can move people out of the cities if you begin to retaliate. You'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; suffer much larger casualties because you can't move.</i><br>
<p>
Now you are being insane. You don't know shit about war. The machines<br>
COST MONEY. People pay taxes to build those machines, and don't like<br>
them being wasted. You dont care because you don't know anything and are<br>
just too stubborn to admit you are wrong.<br>
