That would be much more like imagination than seeing. I do not require<br>
eyes to see things in my head that I make up, but if I want to see<br>
things from the real world then I need something that will recieve<br>
information from the real world.<br>

It was trained to walk, but it could not walk until it had the robot<br>
embodiment. It could think about walking all day long, but until the<br>
instructions were downloaded into the hardware (the robot) there was no<br>
walking going on.<br>
