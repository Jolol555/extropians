I asked:  <br>
<i>&gt;Why do people seem so damn confident of their political opinions?   </i><br>
<p>
"Kathryn Aegis" replied:<br>
<i>&gt;And what are the stakes?  Power, authority, influence, and face.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Politics and money are merely tools towards these ends, and players </i><br>
<i>&gt;are not willing to concede ignorance on any point when this would </i><br>
<i>&gt;give a competitor an advantage in acquiring them.  (But isn't that </i><br>
<i>&gt;basic political economy?)</i><br>
<p>
But why would feigning such an exaggerated overconfidence help you<br>
over a competitor?  (Imagine a toothpaste ad with testimonials of how<br>
switching to their brand was the key to getting promoted, into med<br>
school, winning a Nobel prize, becoming president, etc.)  And if it<br>
did, why would the size of the stakes matter?  Wouldn't the same<br>
strategy give an advantage when smaller stakes were at play?<br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey replies:<br>
<i>&gt;Probably because, IMHUQO, people tend to base their political opinions</i><br>
<i>&gt;on their own experiences, they know what doesn't work, what does work,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and what is likely to benefit them as individuals or members of a group.</i><br>
<p>
This goes against a large empirical literatures that suggests that<br>
voters know very little about politics.  But there is your contrary view.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Conversely, when was the last time the average joe got a chance to bake</i><br>
<i>&gt;a quark for breakfast?</i><br>
<p>
Come on, physics is about lots of very useful stuff like momentum, E&amp;M<br>
radiation, heat diffusion, etc. which touch lots of lives in lots of<br>
ways, and yet most people will defer to experts on these topics. <br>
