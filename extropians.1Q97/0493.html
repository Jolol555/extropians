Michael Lorrey responded: <br>

Curt Adams also responded:<br>
<i>&gt;In land animals, body size hasn't been increasing for quite a while.</i><br>
<i>&gt;... I did miss something.  What exactly do you mean by a local tendency?</i><br>
<p>
Eugene Leitl further responded:<br>
<i>&gt;I think there is some evidence for "progress":</i><br>
<i>&gt;- animal cerebralization quotient has risen</i><br>
<i>&gt;- taxa longevity has risen, indicating risen adaptation to a broader range</i><br>

Mike Butler comments:<br>
<i>&gt;I read Robin's timeframe as billions of years, and his metric as</i><br>
<i>&gt;something like "the centroid of the biomass". </i><br>
<p>
Yes, I am talking about the whole history of life on earth.  And since<br>
we are talking random walks here, a short (&lt;100my) backtrack is nothing.<br>
But my metric is literally "maximum".  The maximum biomass individual on<br>
the planet.  For some old data, see:<br>
<p>
  Dale A. Russell (1983) "Exponential Evolution: Implications for<br>
  Intelligent Extraterrestrial Life" &lt;i&gt;Adv. Space Res.&lt;/i&gt; 3(9):95-103. <br>
<p>
By "local tendency" I mean given the median mass of some species at a<br>
point in time, in what direction is the median of the distribution of<br>
specie's median mass at some future point in time.  If it is toward<br>
larger masses, there is a local tendency toward larger species.  Gould<br>
does explain all this.<br>

Hal Finney writes:<br>
<i>&gt;So ultimately I don't see this point of view as really providing any</i><br>
<i>&gt;insight into the causes of evolution, since it just pushes the effects</i><br>
<i>&gt;of natural selection off into another part of the model, where they</i><br>
<i>&gt;serve to limit the rate at which changes of certain types can occur.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It doesn't mean that selection isn't important; it is just a matter of</i><br>
<i>&gt;what you are paying attention to.</i><br>
<p>
I would think empirical data like this would be very helpful in<br>
deciding what to pay attention to.<br>
