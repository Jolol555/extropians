From: "David Musick" &lt;David_Musick@msn.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Intelligence is not a quantity; it is a collection of cognitive skills.</i><br>
<p>
One form of intelligence testing gives people a lot of different tests<br>
that involve mental abilities.  These will include memorization, math<br>
problems, spatial puzzles, synonyms, producing words with certain<br>
properties, etc.  This gives you a bunch of numbers, the scores on<br>
each test.<br>
<p>
Then a procedure called factor analysis is applied to the statistics.<br>
This looks for underlying factors which can explain all or most of the<br>
variation in scores.  For example, we might have two tests which have<br>
almost perfect correlation among the test subjects.  Everyone who does<br>
well on test A also does just as well on test B, and vice versa.  This<br>
suggests that both tests are measuring the same underlying factor.<br>
<p>
This statistical procedure is relatively automatic.  It can be thought<br>
of as finding the base vectors in a multidimensional space.  As a result<br>
it tells you the dimensionality of the space, which is the number of<br>
different independent kinds of intelligence you have measured.  Once<br>
you have your factors, you can try to use your judgement to give names<br>
to them; one might be reading speed, for example, if it turns out that<br>
tests which involve a lot of reading are heavily influenced by that<br>
factor.<br>
<p>
One controversial question is whether there is a single base factor which<br>
influences all the scores, the so-called "g" factor.  Some people have<br>
argued that there is no "g", that people's scores on all the different<br>
skills are randomly distributed, and that there is no correlation between<br>
abilities in the different skills.  Others have claimed to find in the<br>
statistics evidence that there is such a correlation, that people who tend<br>
to be good at math equations also tend to be good at finding the real point<br>
of a story.  Presumably the existence of the controversy suggests that the<br>
"g" factor, if it exists, is relatively weak.  So this would suggest that<br>
David has the right idea in thinking of intelligence as being a bundle of<br>
skills.<br>
<p>
What this implies is that people we think of as conventionally intelligent<br>
may actually be much more diverse than we imagine.  They may all have<br>
different skills, and they have learned to compensate for weaknesses<br>
in some areas by using their strengths in others.  Maybe one person is<br>
very creative but weaker in logical reasoning; another has an excellent<br>
memory so they have all relevant info always at hand, even if they don't<br>
do that much with it.  Still another person can easily see the effects<br>
of an action, and although he's not that good at coming up with new<br>
ideas he tends to be very successful.<br>
<p>
Probably most so-called smart people do not have too many significant<br>
mental weaknesses, so they are not too hampered by their relative<br>
handicaps.  Other people may have a wider range of abilities, as when we<br>
run into a seemingly mundane person who startles us with a mental skill.<br>
Some people will be high in all areas, and they probably fall into the<br>
genius category.  Others will be extremely high in some specific area,<br>
pretty high in others, and these also would be geniuses of a different<br>
kind.<br>
<p>
Overlayed on all this variation is the pervasive socialization effect<br>
which drives us all to be similar.  Probably we are a lot more different<br>
under the surface than most people think.<br>
