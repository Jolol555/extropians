I agree, but the main worry I have is that there are most likely other <br>
ways of causing disaster ("cavitronics" a la Brin creating quantum black <br>
holes, vacuum decay generators, invocations of Cthulhu). One idea <br>
proposed in Brin's _Earth_ is that the silence in the sky is due to the <br>
extreme simplicity for an advanced civilization to destroy itself; I <br>
don't want to believe it, but he has a point. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Best would be mutable systems that could be changed to small</i><br>

<i>&gt; they were protected against everything, but you wouldn't worry about</i><br>
<i>&gt; plagues, because there woouldn't be a common system to infect. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, the immune system would need to evolve to keep up with new threats <br>
and changing conditions. The goal should not be 100% security (that <br>
doesn't exist), but that all problems remain bounded and preferably small.<br>
<p>
Someone challenged the readers of sci.nanotech to come up with designs <br>
for a nanotech immune system so that he could try to find holes in them <br>
to exploit; I think it would be a great idea if we could help this <br>
important work. <br>
<p>
I think a fruitful approach would be to look at biology and compare the <br>
similarities and differences between the bio and nano problems, and then <br>
try to exploit what we can learn from evolution. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Security in the High Beyond is largely cryptology and</i><br>
<i>&gt; immunology, especially combined.</i><br>
<p>
If you look at them as finding entities that try to exploit your system <br>
and then removing their access to it, then they become identical. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't have any bright ideas for defense against Really Big Explosions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Nukes, asteroids, solar flares, etc.)</i><br>
<p>
Dispersion and prevention is the only way to deal with this; for every<br>
defense you can come up with, I can come up with a bigger explosion. <br>
