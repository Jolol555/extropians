Godel's Theorem states that if we have a consistent logical system (of <br>
sufficient power to state mathematical truths), there will be mathematical <br>
truths which cannot be proven from within the system.  This means that there <br>
are some things which are true which are impossible to *know for sure* from <br>
within our logical framework.  <br>
<p>
Practiacally speaking, though, does it really matter?  Yes, we can't know <br>
*every single little truth*, but so what?  About what percentage of all <br>
possible truths does Godel's Theorem make off limits to us?  My understanding <br>
is that it is a very miniscule fraction of the set of all possible truths.  So <br>
we can know *almost everything*; that's good enough for me.  Among all that <br>
attainable knowledge, there is sure to be lots of useful facts we can benefit <br>
from.<br>
<p>
Our knowledge is going to be V_A_S_ T .  A few little specks here and there <br>
that we don't know with absolute surety will probably not be too devastating.<br>
