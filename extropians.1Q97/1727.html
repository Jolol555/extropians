Cryonics "exists" as does religion but neither are satisfactory. Weak<br>
uploading does exist today because a brain can be kept alive indefinitely<br>
on life support systems with sensory interfaces to computers. This may well<br>
be the best path to strong Uploading but the problems nowadays are<br>
politically antagonistic. Circular ethical "human" definitions need<br>
straightening out. All the rest is easy. My point, partly in thanks to<br>
knowledge gained from the forlorn hope of early cryonic clients, is that<br>
weak uploaders can gradually tie on stronger interfaces as biology gives<br>
way. This approach best protects the legal status of the uploader which is<br>
why the legal challenge has to occur now. <br>
<p>
Identify the main stumbling blocks like this legal issue and go after them.<br>
Incidentally, no amount of private research funding can overcome this, only<br>
intentional political reality can. The solution is in the public will, at<br>
which point no private research funding is be needed. The guidelines for<br>
socialized research will permit voluntary agreement to go ahead. <br>
