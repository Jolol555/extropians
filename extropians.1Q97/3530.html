<p>
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) appears to be a good point of<br>
departure. With minimal adaption, it may prove to be an effective means<br>
of avoiding and reducing irrational thought and neurosis, thus<br>
facillitating improved cognitive abilities.   <br>
<p>
What REBT appears to lack from an initial an cursory exploration of it:<br>
<p>
1. REBT lacks methods for individuals to determine personl patterns of<br>
irrational thought that may not be included in the "12 Irrational Ideas<br>
That Cause and Sustain Neurosis". <br>
<p>
2. REBT lacks thoughts on, and ideas for, effectively applying emotions.<br>
There seems to be two important aspects of emotive education, (1)<br>
reducing the control our emotions have over us, and (2) increasing our<br>
control over our emotions, increasing our ability to effectively employ<br>
our emotive intelligence. REBT may prove useful for the former, but<br>
another system(s) will be required for the latter. <br>
<p>
3. "REBT is based on the assumption that what we label our "emotional"<br>
reactions are largely caused by our conscious and unconscious<br>
evaluations, interpretations, and philosophies." However, REBT is sort<br>
of like a shotgun blast into the dark, hoping that we blow away the<br>
shackles which are pulling our rationality into the depths of<br>
irrationality. In other words, REBT lacks methods of exploring the<br>
subconscious. REBT does not appear to require such to be effective, but<br>
such may augment REBT while certainly facillitating other concerns of<br>
emotive education.<br>
<p>
The following is a list without descriptions of the "12 Irrational Ideas<br>
That Cause and Sustain Neurosis":<br>
<p>
1. The idea that it is a dire necessity for adults to be loved by<br>
significant others for almost everything they do.<br>
<p>
2. The idea that certain acts are awful or wicked, and that people who<br>
perform such acts should be severely damned.<br>
<p>
3. The idea that it is horrible when things are not the way we like them<br>
to be.<br>
<p>
4. The idea that human misery is invariably externally caused and is<br>
forced on us by outside people and events.<br>
<p>
5. The idea that if something is or may be dangerous or fearsome we<br>
should be terribly upset and endlessly obsess about it.<br>
<p>
6. The idea that it is easier to avoid than to face life difficulties<br>
and self-responsibilities.<br>
<p>
7. The idea that we absolutely need something other or stronger or<br>
greater than ourself on which to rely. <br>
<p>
8. The idea that we should be thoroughly competent, intelligent, and<br>
achieving in all possible respects.<br>
<p>
9. The idea that because something once strongly affected our life, it<br>
should indefinitely affect it.<br>
<p>
10. The idea that we must have certain and perfect control over things.<br>
<p>
11. The idea that human happiness can be achieved by inertia and<br>
inaction.<br>
<p>
12. The idea that we have virtually no control over our emotions and<br>
that we cannot help feeling disturbed about things.<br>
<p>
<p>
And here are the three main differences from REBT has from other<br>
schools, also without descriptions:<br>
<p>
1. De-emphasis of early childhood.<br>
<p>
2. Emphasis on deep philosophical change and scientific thinking. <br>
<p>
3. Use of psychological homework. <br>
<p>

<p>
<p>
Though "Peter Small's 'How God Makes God' CD-ROM, describing the<br>
systematic principles underlying the spontaneous order we have to<br>
survive in" is not a system within itself. I agree that issues of this<br>
nature will be important to implement in Emotive Education.<br>
<p>
I wasn't particularly thrilled with the project on Emotive Decision<br>
Making. Though in concept it was striving for something beyond<br>
traditional attempts at AI, in execution it all boiled down to the same<br>
thing. I believe what is missing in this area, and what may be missing<br>
for some time to come, is computers that can truly experience feelings,<br>
pleasure and pain. Is anyone aware of research into the development of<br>
such peripheals? I know we now have touch sensitive robotics, but has<br>
anyone taken that a step further, attempting to create an actual<br>
experiential discomfort or pleasure in the robot? I don't think we<br>
really understand this well enough yet to mimic it.<br>
<p>
<p>
For those interested, I have now devoted the Triberian Institute and its<br>
newly refurbished website to Emotive Education. I would greatly<br>
appreciate constructive criticism on any area within it that you may<br>
find yourselves particularly attracted to. Nothing is final, everything<br>
is open to refined and ceaseless evolution.<br>
