A lurker wrote to me --<br>
	I'm afraid I'm new on this list and not aware of the history of<br>
	this thread. can you briefly explain to me how libertarianism is<br>
	diametrically oposed to socialism? That is the message I'm getting<br>
	out of your recent posts and I'd like to understand better what it<br>
	is you're trying to say and the theory supporting it.<br>
<p>
The question seems to me important enough to reply in public.<br>
<p>
Socialism is the principle that the means of production ought to be<br>
owned and controlled by the People as a whole - which in practice means<br>
the politicians control everything.  Libertarianism holds that the people<br>
are better off if ownership of the means of production is widely<br>
distributed among individuals (or voluntary groups) under the discipline<br>
of a free market.<br>
<p>
Socialists hold that free markets lead to monopolies.  Libertarians<br>
say that's clearly not true, but even if it were, it's no reason<br>
to create One Big Monopoly.<br>
<p>
Socialists tend to treat the People as a single mass - it's not a defining<br>
feature of socialism, but they tend to talk that way.  Libertarians (at<br>
least the philosophical ones, not necessary the pragmatic-economic kind)<br>
insist on methodological individualism - we don't *deny* that there is<br>
or can be a collective Will of the People, but we say that *if* it exists<br>
it will manifest itself through the voluntary actions of individuals --<br>
and that any use of force to impose the Will of the People is evidence<br>
that it is bogus.<br>
<p>
In one sense, libertarianism is *not* opposed to socialism at all, though<br>
socialism *is* opposed to libertarianism.  (What?!)  A libertarian world<br>
tolerates voluntary socialist enclaves (say, the utopian colonies of<br>
the American Midwest in the XIX century) because there's no ethical rule<br>
against them.  A socialist world does not tolerate libertarian enclaves:<br>
if you tell the taxman that transactions within your Capitalist Club are<br>
not subject to his rules, he'll laugh at you.<br>
<p>
I hope I've answered the question.<br>
