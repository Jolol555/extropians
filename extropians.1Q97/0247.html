                    <br>
<p>
Today's government decides it would be altruistic to build somebody a house  <br>
for free, the tax man comes to me and asks me for the money to do so,  <br>
I politely tell the tax gentleman that I don't think that is a productive <br>
form of altruism and don't wish to contribute to it, the tax man goes away and <br>
nothing happens for the next several weeks except my snail mail increases, <br>
I get a lot of certified letters, and brown envelopes marked "Official U.S. <br>
Government  Business". After a month or two a man wearing a suite will knock <br>
on my door  and tell me that because of my failure to pay back taxes my house<br>
now belongs  to the U.S. Government and I have 20 minutes to leave the area. <br>
I tell the nice man that I like my house and don't intend to leave. After an <br>
hour or two several clean cut young men wearing body armor and carrying <br>
submachine guns from the SWAT team knock down my door.<br>
<p>
In the real world things seldom go to that extreme, but only because most   <br>
people don't have a death wish. Everyone knows that they will not take "no" <br>
for an answer, the government will make you an offer you can't refuse, pay <br>
the tribute, go to jail, or die. Unlike corporations, government could not <br>
exist without violence, the fact that it is usually implied does not make it<br>
less  distasteful. If I put a gun to your head and say "give me your wallet", <br>
I think you would say you were robbed of your money by violence , even if I  <br>
never pulled the trigger.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                 &gt;many voluntary socialized conditions do exist even today.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Agreed. I should have said it can't be a socialist government, or more simply,  <br>
it can't be a government, nothing voluntary about them. As you may have  <br>
guessed, I don't like government much, yet every year I give nearly half of  <br>
my income to this organization, and if they tell me they want even more I'll  <br>
give  them that too. Why? Because there is not a drop of heroic blood in me <br>
and I know that unless I submit to my masters at some point, the  chain of <br>
cause and event will invariably lead to my death.<br>
                  <br>

My opinion of elections is nearly as low as my opinion of Governments.<br>
