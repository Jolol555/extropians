The following expresses some uncharacteristically dark thoughts, so I write<br>
here under a pseudonym.<br>
<p>
Yesterday afternoon, sitting outside in the brilliant sunshine of the first<br>
full day of Spring, 1997, at lunch with one of my good friends, I was feeling<br>
very positive and optimistic.  The conversation turned to the recent cloning<br>
of an adult mammal and other breakthroughs in biotech, such as DNA chips.  I<br>
began to speak enthusiastically of transhumanism and the goals held dear by<br>
extropians.  Soon, I was dismayed to note that my friend was expressing very<br>
negative attitudes toward my expressions of optimism.  He said that I was<br>
crazy to want to do these things, that death was part of the natural order,<br>
that humans couldn't possibly keep from doing terrible evil with the new<br>
powers I looked forward to, that I and my cohorts were hastening a<br>
catastrophe.  The list of horrors he said would follow from our program went<br>
on for some time:  Overpopulation due to increased longevity; increased<br>
social stratification due to augmentation of the wealthy and powerful;<br>
ecological havoc created by artificial organisms and nanotechnology;<br>
distorted, unhealthy personalities created by experimental alteration of the<br>
human brain . . .<br>
<p>
Before long, my friend, who is very well educated, scientifically literate<br>
and not at all religious in any traditional sense of the word, said that my<br>
desires were evil, pure and simple, and made reference to Nazi eugenics.  He<br>
said that it was a very good thing that only a tiny minority of people felt<br>
the way I did and that he hoped I and my fellow transhumanists would never<br>
have a chance to do the things we wanted to do.  The lunch ended on a very<br>
sour note and I fear my friendship is mortally wounded.<br>
<p>
Of course, this isn't the first time that this has happened.  In fact, I<br>
write here now because this experience is so very, very common.  The<br>
overwhelming majority of intelligent and well-educated people to whom I<br>
attempt to explain transhumanism react negatively.  The reactions range from<br>
condescension, through fear and horror to hostile expressions of intention to<br>
actively oppose transhumanism.  Here is just a brief list of the common<br>
reactions I receive:<br>
<p>
"Extropian libertarianism is naive and simplistic in a juvenile way.  Its<br>
association with Ayn Rand and 'objectivism' will consign it permanently to<br>
the fringe.  A lot of teen agers go through an ‘Atlas Shrugged phase': How<br>
old did you say most of these people are?"<br>
<p>
"Transhumanism is an immature rejection of reality, a selfish and<br>
self-centered desire to escape from the simple and basic facts of life. Quit<br>
dreaming."<br>
<p>
"Extropians are a bunch of mad scientists who simply haven't studied history.<br>
 Rushing into the things they want to do is likely to cause an economic or<br>
ecological disaster.  If there were even the slightest chance any of this<br>
stuff would come into being, I'd be the first to vote to regulate all of it.<br>
 Maybe some of this stuff could do some good, but not if you rush into it,<br>
and not if you do it all at once.  Just because you can do something doesn't<br>
mean you should."<br>
<p>
"Transhumanists want to create a master race, just like the Nazis.  And don't<br>
they think Nietzsche is some sort of intellectual godfather?  What does that<br>
tell you?"<br>
<p>
"Extropians are elitists.  What about the billions of people suffering on the<br>
edge of starvation?  Sounds like they want a bunch of high-tech toys for a<br>
few rich white male Americans that will just make things worse for everybody<br>
else."<br>
<p>
These are just the reactions of the people who can qualify as educated and<br>
relatively sophisticated in their thinking.  Religious people and less well<br>
educated people express similar reactions, but in different terms.<br>
<p>
The fact is that we are a tiny minority among a tiny minority.  Most people<br>
on this planet couldn't even begin to comprehend the things we look forward<br>
to because they don't have the knowledge or the mental energy.  Within the<br>
small fragment of humanity that has the education and leisure to understand<br>
the basic concepts of transhumanism and extropiansim, all but a very few<br>
reject our ideas, values and goals on principle.<br>
<p>
This realization would be no more than a little emotionally depressing, if it<br>
didn't underlie the very real possibility that the quickening pace of<br>
scientific discovery and technological development will trigger a strong<br>
reaction against progress toward post-humanity.  We've all seen the reaction<br>
to "Dolly".  Soon, even more radical possibilities will be apparent to even<br>
the least technologically oriented.<br>
<p>
Dynamic optimism is a good thing.  But all the optimism in the world can't<br>
overcome a massive social, cultural and political reaction against augmenting<br>
and transcending the human condition.  Staying encapsulated within our own<br>
little social sphere, talking only to others who share our values and goals,<br>
we may not even see the reaction coming.  But (based on my repeated<br>
experience), even a patient explanation of our ideas to "outsiders" seems to<br>
do no more than arm the opposition.<br>
<p>
