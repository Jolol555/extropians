<i>&gt; &gt;From: Ray Peck &lt;rpeck@PureAtria.COM&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But techno seemed, to me, to adopt the "electronic" sound as a fetish,</i><br>
<i>&gt; affectation, attitude or nostalgia thing.  And, it all seems 120 beats per</i><br>
<i>&gt; minute, 4/4, one or two chords to me, no matter how much filter "eer-</i><br>
<i>&gt; err-oor-oop" and strange sampled vocals are going on.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
 Speaking as a techno musician, of both house and drum&amp;bass genres, I<br>
 have to say that you are quite right about techno not being experimental<br>
 in a sense.  Modern techno music is a quite narrowly constrained genre.<br>
All the sounds, fx, etc., are designed with people in mind who are out of<br>
their trees on drugs.  There is a selection pressure that comes from the<br>
dance floor, via the DJ, to the music-makers, that drives us to copy what<br>
other people are doing that works on the dance floor.  <br>
 <br>
 But then, you see, techno is not art music, it is music that does a job<br>
 of work - to get people who are out of their heads as high as possible<br>
 and get them moving.<br>
<p>
That said, what moves the genre forward *is* experimentation.  There's a<br>
cost/benefit thing here: if I experiment too much outside the acceptable<br>
aural canon then I run the risk of not selling records; if I don't<br>
experiment enough, then there's nothing fresh in my record, and again, I<br>
run the risk of not selling records.  If I get it right, then my<br>
experiment becomes part of the canon.<br>
<p>
The whole thing is a beautiful example of 1) the free market at work,<br>
and 2) the aesthetic notion that great art comes from tightly circumscribed<br>
art forms, not rule-less free-form 'self-expression'.<br>
