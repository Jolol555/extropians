I am unable to connect to Russell Whitaker's copy of Engines of Creation<br>
at <a href="http://www.asiapac.com/EnginesOfCreation/">http://www.asiapac.com/EnginesOfCreation/</a>, nor for that matter to<br>
his site asiapac.com, nor to his SGI web. I thought there was a mirror<br>
of EOC somewhere in Europe (in Poland?), but I can't find that either.<br>
Does anyone know what the story is?<br>
<p>
I think it would be a good idea for a plaintext version of EOC to be<br>
circulated on the net as well, eg via Project Gutenberg, in the<br>
fashion of Bruce Sterling's Hacker Crackdown. This may be unfashionable, <br>
it might neglect the benefits of hypertext, etc, but ASCII texts do<br>
at least spread a little more widely than HTML ones, at present.<br>
