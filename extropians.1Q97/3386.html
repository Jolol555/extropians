<i>&gt; I'd like a high income, too.  High enough to allow me to pay</i><br>
<i>&gt; my phone bills, finance my computer activities, realize myself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But is it still self-interest to accumulate millions or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; billions?  Is it need?  If this wealth was shared, nobody would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to starve.  There would be no poverty.  Everything would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be great, fantastic, perfect.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem you ignore is accumulation.</i><br>
<p>
We don't ignore the problem, we just have better than a 3rd-grade<br>
understanding of economics.  Your puerile fantasy above assumes<br>
that "accumulated wealth" is like a big pile of food being hoarded<br>
but not eaten by anyone.  Let's examine one particular accumulator:<br>
<p>
Not one single dollar of Bill Gates' fortune is being unproductive.<br>
Most of it exists in the form of Microsoft stock, actively feeding<br>
the 12,000 families of MS employees, their distributers, suppliers,<br>
disk makers, retailers, consultants, trainers, magazine publishers,<br>
and all of the other productivity that MS created; some part of his<br>
wealth is being consumed in his fancy new house, cars, travel,<br>
entertainment, etc.--employing lots of builders, auto makers, plane<br>
mechanics, movie producers; the remainder of the money is personal<br>
investment, such as bank accounts, personally owned stocks, bonds,<br>
venture capital, etc.  This amount, even though he may have a bank<br>
receipt saying that his account has $1,000,000, the fact is that <br>
the bank is then lending that money to new couples to buy houses<br>
and cars, to small businesses, to developers.  Banks typically only<br>
have on-hand less than 10% of the actual deposited amounts; all the<br>
rest is in investments working.<br>
<p>
If you think wealth redistribution reduces poverty, then prove it. <br>
The historical evidence is that it has been tried and failed every<br>
time.  Actions must be judged by their rationally expected results,<br>
not by their motives.  A hungry man prefers actual, physically<br>
existing food to a society that /wants/ to feed him but does not.<br>
Capitalism feeds people.  Socialism steals their money and leaves<br>
them begging.  Results are what matters.<br>
