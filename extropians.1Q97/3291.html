<i>&gt;The normal outcome if you have to choose amounts of two good things when your</i><br>

<i>&gt;situation in early modern (pre-industrial) Europe.  It's conventional wisdom</i><br>
<i>&gt;that this situation applies to most other pre-industrial societies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The puzzle is why this outcome does not apply to industrial societies.</i><br>
<p>
This thread started by my mentioning a study showing that in a<br>
*pre-industrial* society, wealthy dads did not have more kids.  <br>
