<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please explain what you mean here, because my mind has no referent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the word "economics" that comes anywhere close to the attributes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; you assign to it here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Avarice &gt; self-interest &gt; Economics</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I ask for a definition, and you just name three things that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing to do with each other?  Is your mind so full of floating</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstractions and propaganda that you can't define terms clearly?</i><br>
<p>
I can't apologize enough for not saying that the above three terms were<br>
linked by historical evidence as being the conditional terms as used in the<br>
17th, 18th and 19th century to explain the prevailing money phenomenon. I<br>
thought you actually wanted a referent for your mind as to how economics as<br>
practiced in 1997 can be likened to a mind-control Scientology-like cult.<br>
That is why I proposed you should view my juxtaposition for Upload<br>
Counseling at the "Counter Capitalism" link on my website, from which I<br>
quote:-<br>
<p>
"In its efforts to conceal this reality, capitalism has become notorious<br>
for vicious attacks and disregard of the rights of any who would expose the<br>
truth of its actual practices. As with rape and other abuse, society's<br>
activity can cause lasting harm to those involved, to families, and to<br>
mankind."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you deny that need and scarcity exist? </i><br>
<p>
It only exists in the minds of those who don't realize that it should no<br>
longer be of concern in an automated society. Uploading is a different<br>
ball-game and the rules have changed.<br>
<p>
<p>
Best,<br>
<p>
