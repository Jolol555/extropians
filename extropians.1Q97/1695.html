If I connected my brain to another brain by a neuron<br>
 what would it feel like?<br>
Could I switch brains?<br>
How could conciousness be transfered?<br>
<p>
Oh no.<br>
I forgot what makes me me.<br>
[sigh]<br>
<p>
Oh well, being uploaded is the goal of this topic so I'll talk about that.<br>
I want it to be an evolution.<br>
I want everything that is a part of me to become what will be me.<br>
I am afraid that most uploading process being explored<br>
 would not be considered evolution.<br>
For instance if my body were destroyed during a scan,<br>
 which would be used to design and construct a new body, <br>
 I would at that time experience "death".<br>
That is not something I want to experience.<br>
Perhaps I'll consider that process if my vaporized particles would be<br>
molded,    but I imagine realizing that the substance which makes up my<br>
pattern is now     disintegrating and floating away unbidden is a bit<br>
uncomfortable ( a bit like   my mind forming a thought which is beyond it's<br>
normal physical limitations ).<br>
Do you want your brain to become a cloud, <br>
 rapidly dispersing beyond your control?<br>
I do not.<br>
