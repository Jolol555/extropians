<p>
Not True. We mean that if A exists then B will exist further along a sequence. <br>
If A is a rock moving at high speed toward a plate glass window, and B is <br>
broken glass, then we know that if you have a you will have B. However if you <br>
have B that does not prove that A must have existed because a baseball will <br>
break a window as well as a rock.<br>

Of course it's your "fault". If you're stupid and boring then the fault is  <br>
in you and I wouldn't want to hang around you or listen to your ideas. <br>
If you've done evil things then the fault is in you and you should be <br>
punished so you won't do more evil in the future and as a deterrent to others. <br>
Why you are stupid and evil is not important, you're still stupid and evil.<br>
<p>
In the same way if, you're brilliant and do good things you should be praised <br>
and rewarded.                                      <br>
