<p>
No, although the retort "So you mean God exists outside of the set of<br>
things that exist?" at least is fun to say. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, one argument I see theists constantly using is that of teleology.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, this is a very common argument. I like to explain to tell them about <br>
the regular hexagonal pattern of Rayleigh-Bernard convection, and how it <br>
appears as patterns of stones on the tundra, the shells of some species <br>
of snails and in many other places in physics. It is complex and ordered, <br>
who created it? Generally, theists often do not realize how prevalent <br>
self-organization is in the universe; even if you ascribe it to the will <br>
of God it is obvious that the will must act on the mathematical level <br>
(since otherwise formal alife simulations would be provably interfered <br>
with by God) and not on the physical level. Unfortunately most theists <br>
just assimilate this argument, by conveniantly ignoring its implications.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	I disagree with Johnny Carwash's statement that some are too pious</i><br>

<i>&gt; coexist(although I think he actually said faith and nanotechnology)</i><br>
<p>
Well, it is (almost) unprovable whether person A can not be swayed. One<br>
might consider something like the "purgatorium" idea in Tipler's _Physics<br>
of Immortality_, where an omega-being tries to convince an evil person<br>
without directly changing his brain. This is a finite game, since after a<br>
certain, very long, time the person due to his finite brain will start to<br>
repeat himself, so the number of "game positions" (mental states) is<br>
finite. Tipler asks the question if there are winning strategies in this<br>
game, and one might ask the same for the "swaying game". But it is rather<br>
theoretical, in practice most people can be influenced given enough work<br>
but some are very stubborn. <br>
