<i>&gt; For example: There have been approximately 5.5 million inventions</i><br>

<p>
I would like to lay to rest the notion that patent enforcement is necessary<br>
for invention.  Two countries in the 19th century, the Netherlands and<br>
Switzerland, deliberately eliminated patent protection for several decades.<br>
 In the Netherlands there was no measurable effect on the rates of invention.<br>
 In Switzerland the rate of invention increased; the Swiss chemical industry<br>
came to world prominence during that period. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;while laborers have</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked approximately 25 x 10^13 hours in US history. This means that</i><br>
<i>&gt; in fair market value, the average invention is equal to 4.55 million</i><br>
<i>&gt; man hours of physical labor in relative scarcity. If we value the</i><br>
<i>&gt; average man hour at as little as $1.00 per hour (which was typical</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the turn of the century, never mind that 2/3 of all workers have</i><br>
<i>&gt; lived since that time) we see that the fair market value for an average</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention is $4.55 million dollars. </i><br>
<p>
That's a complete nonsequitur.  You're assuming that the market value <br>
of patentable inventions developed over the period equals that of labor of<br>
the period.  There is no necessary connection between the two numbers, any<br>
more than between the market value of inventions and that of infrastructure<br>
or capital investments, or for that matter any arbitrary subset of labor,<br>
infrastructure, or investments.<br>
