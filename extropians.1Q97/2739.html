Robin Hanson:<br>
<i>&gt;But why would feigning such an exaggerated overconfidence help you</i><br>
<i>&gt;over a competitor?</i><br>
<p>
Because the basic American ideal of political leadership is based on an <br>
authoritarian model, hence the intractable positions of the two major <br>
political parties and the blowhard style of debate in Congress.  If you <br>
will notice, it is only when the President calls for bipartisan action <br>
that the two parties begin to negotiate on the same side of the table--he <br>
provides the mechanism by which neither side loses face or authority.<br>
(my major is in poli sci and I did some political campaign work here <br>
in Washington, just so you know where I'm coming from on this).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And if it did, why would the size of the stakes matter?  Wouldn't the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;strategy give an advantage when smaller stakes were at play?</i><br>
<p>
Conflict theory states that the items that are less important to each <br>
side lend themselves to multiple avenues of negotiation, whereas <br>
parties tend to become entrenched on the bigger, or underlying issues <br>
involving face, power, authority, or influence.  It's definitely a <br>
complex question, and one that literature is just beginning to appear <br>
on.  <br>
