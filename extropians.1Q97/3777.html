<i>&gt; From: Eugene Leitl </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    I'll give you a different problem to worry about...  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; people of all ages today who are falling off the technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; bandwagon.  Those who manage to stay on the tiger (Mixed metaphores?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why not?), are getting further and further ahead of those not on</i><br>
<i>&gt; board.  Will there be a point at which no one not already on the train</i><br>
<i>&gt; can get on?  Sure looks like it.  That is the problem I worry about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
What we need to do is to make technology teach about itself. The only<br>
teacher that can keep up with technology's pace is technology itself.<br>
<p>
Technology should be dead simple and yet still explain the underlying<br>
technology/methods. If this doesn't happen we will loose most of mankind in<br>
ignorance and only the technoelite will have wealth and power.<br>
The Marshall help just after WW2 is a good example. The US didn't just<br>
grant us Europeans all those money to be nice but also to create a market<br>
for their own products in the future. I don't think it can be argued that<br>
they succeded.<br>
<p>
If a single group of people are rich they are not as rich as they could be,<br>
if there were more rich people. Therefore we must at all cost try to avoid<br>
that the technoelite is the only rich/powerfull group. It would make all<br>
the poorer. Including the technoelite.<br>
