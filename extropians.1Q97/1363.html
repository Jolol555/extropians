&lt;&lt;Sorry, any name naturally ending in s gets an apostrophe only when in   <br>
 the possessive.  &gt;&gt;   <br>
 <br>
That's true. But where do you place it?  <br>
Apostrophes can indicate a singular or a plural possessive:     <br>
architect's  (singular) vs. architects'  (plural)   <br>
boy's (singular) vs. boys'  (plural)   <br>
We should not add an extra s after a plural possessive ending in s.  Instead,<br>
just place an apostrophe at the right of the last s letter.   For singular<br>
nouns ending in an -s you may add either an apostrophe after the final s or<br>
you may add an extra s (-s's).  Both are correct according to _Handbook of<br>
Current English_ 8th edition, page 135, 1989.  Checking the 1991 Scott,<br>
Foreman Handbook for Writers 2nd edition also says s' and s's for singular<br>
possessive are both correct, but Descartes' is preferred as in the example<br>
Travis'  (not Travis's).  No reference is made to ancient vs. modern.<br>
<p>
But, you must be consistent for each publication you are submitting to.  Some<br>
(all good) publishers have copyeditors (not so much line editors) who will<br>
catch this (not really an error, more of a convention for that publishing<br>
house).   <br>
   <br>
So, Moses' and Moses's and Descartes' and Descartes's can be BOTH correct<br>
according to that 1989 and 1991 copyrighted books.  There is no current<br>
generally accepted rule indicating ancient vs. modern usage in those<br>
references.  Also, we may have learned from schools who had a particular<br>
publishing rule to abide by say not Strunk and White.  I must spell<br>
connection as connexion for some publications.<br>

"The Elements of Style", 3rd Edition, page *1*:  <br>
  Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names in -es and -is,  <br>
  the possessive "Jesus'", and such forms as "for conscience' sake",  <br>
"for   righteousness' sake".  But such forms as "Moses' Laws", "Isis' temple"<br>
 <br>
  are commonly replaced by &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Meaning that could still be correct, but commonly are also correct as:<br>
&lt;&lt; the laws of Moses   the temple of Isis&gt;&gt;  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;I happen to have a reknowned grammar book ("The Elements of Style")<br>
in front of me, and I also happen to be right&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Becareful here.  The English languare is changing faster that ever.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; (unless the style has changed since whenever the book was published, which<br>
is a possibility).&gt;&gt;  <br>
<p>
Now, your talk'n.<br>
<p>
Well. . . , the conventions (no such thing) may be different comparing the<br>
references, but can we at least settle that EoS is not 100% definative?<br>
 Nothing is in English.  My publishers, at least, will agree with me. <br>
<p>
Unless the copyeditor needs to change it.  I would use this Copyright 1979<br>
S&amp;W's _EoS_ 3rd ed. reference, Moses or at least Moses' and definitely<br>
Descartes'.  &lt;&lt;Mike:  "I guess I wasn't clear. Descartes would be Descartes'<br>
in the  posessive,<br>
rather than Descartes's" &gt;&gt;  Either can be correct but I too like Descartes'<br>
. . .   Besides, I get tongue twisted pronouncing Moses'seses  and<br>
Descartes'seses.  <br>
