<p>
I think this is largely a myth, though a myth with some foundation in<br>
truth. It's certainly a widespread myth; I'm amazed and amused by the<br>
difference in people's reactions when I meet them and tell them I'm a<br>
computer programmer and when I tell them I'm a film-maker (since I'm<br>
programming to fund my film-making). Because the stereotypes are so<br>
different they treat me very differently even though I'm exactly the same<br>
person; I think this says more about the general level of communication<br>
between members of the human race than computer people. Most people care<br>
far more about personas than the personality behind them. <br>
<p>
I think that a large part of the problem is that computer people are doing<br>
things which 'normal' people simply cannot understand because they lack<br>
the technical knowledge, and hence those people cannot understand the<br>
computer people either. I can't, for example, explain to my artistic<br>
friends why I object to Windows on aesthetic grounds (at the emotional<br>
level the internals of the code are just horrid), while I can readily<br>
understand why they prefer one book or painting over another. If everyone<br>
programmed computers and only a few people painted we'd probably see a<br>
similar stereotype in the other direction. Hmm, now there's an idea for a<br>
story... <br>
<p>
As for passion, many of the people I know in the industry are so<br>
passionate about whatever project they're working on that I avoid them for<br>
the same reason I'd avoid an overly passionate artist; there's nothing in<br>
their life except their work so they can't talk about anything else. <br>
<p>
Perhaps another issue is jealousy. Since programmers are so powerful in<br>
modern society and their world is so hard for outsiders to understand, the<br>
outsiders want a reason to feel superior. Hence, "well, computer people<br>
may be creating all this technology around us, but I know all about<br>
emotions and they don't so I'm superior". Bullshit, but probably<br>
reassuring bullshit for some. <br>
<p>
I admit I do have a problem with people who do stupid things for no<br>
rational reason and then complain about it and explain that 'their<br>
emotions made them do it'; my goal is to maximise my potential for life,<br>
and playing silly games like that isn't going to help. I can get very<br>
emotional, but my emotions aid my goals rather than detract from them. The<br>
difference seems to be that I've integrated my emotions into the rest of<br>
my personality so that emotions are something that I have, whereas many<br>
people feel that emotions are something external which happen to them. I<br>
can understand why they do the things they do, based on the emotions they<br>
have, but I still think it's very stupid. I would feel the same way <br>
whether or not I was a programmer.<br>
<p>
Of course another issue is that computer programmers are well-paid<br>
professionals and hence the people who take the job are more likely to be<br>
rational and career-minded than the sort who'll chuck in a job and follow<br>
some random person to Peru in the name of love. Most of the lawyers and<br>
other professionals I've met seem to fit the 'emotionless' stereotype just<br>
as well as most of the programmers. This is probably the 'foundation' I<br>
was talking about above; professionals who have to work in teams and meet<br>
deadlines must be able to switch off their emotions when neccesary in<br>
order to get the job done. This doesn't mean that they're emotionless the<br>
rest of the time. <br>
