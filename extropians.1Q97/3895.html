______________  Please post this everywhere an identical  twin clone can<br>
read! ________________<br>
<p>
A message to all those racist people, including governments and religions<br>
 who haven't<br>
 learned how  to help themselves yet!<br>
<p>
Since I am a bonified  human clone amongst millions of others, (an<br>
identical twin)  I am<br>
 finding all this debate about  human cloning a bit offensive  to myself<br>
and others  I know<br>
 and love.  Kind of smacks me  in the face as though I am being <br>
discriminated against<br>
 in a way Kind of like the black  people of the world and our country <br>
were and still are being<br>
treated.  <br>
<p>
***** In case you haven't learned it yet guys,  discrimination and racism<br>
of any race <br>
or group of people is wrong,  unlawful and extremely  immoral! *****<br>
<p>
 This kind of  childish behavior hurts people and sometimes gets people<br>
killed as a byproduct of<br>
 the hatreds it breads amongst gullible ignorant people! ( To President<br>
Clinton,<br>
 I sure hope you aren't one of these racist persons!  You don't need<br>
ethologist or self appointed religious<br>
 leaders to tell you how to read your own mindful-heart,  and if you do, <br>
we are all in for more trouble than I thought.)<br>
<p>
Human clones exist today in me,  my twin clone, and  in the hundreds of<br>
millions of others! <br>
 We are not a small group!  And we are not deserving to be a subject of<br>
racism or discriminatory <br>
 talk any more than any other race,  religion,  or people are.  <br>
<p>
PUBLIC NOTICE:<br>
I am hereby putting these the  United States Nation on notice,  that such<br>
continued inflammatory <br>
 talks is paramount to slander and racism on a grand scale,  and I<br>
formally demand that this stupid<br>
inflammatory  debate be  stopped! Also I request  a letter from the<br>
president of this nation,  to this<br>
nation to be entered into  the public record, and :televised live" since<br>
the stupid debate has<br>
been publicized the same,  recognizing our human rights as any other<br>
person of this nation or world have.<br>
<p>
We are alive,  and human,  and are a formal part of every race, religion<br>
and culture on earth today,<br>
and always have been.  I think it's time all twin clones of this world<br>
stand up and claim our right <br>
(in a way that people can't ignore) to exist,  procreate, and have<br>
normally acceptable lives as any<br>
other individual.<br>
<p>
This issue of whether human clones have rights to exist and do any/all<br>
things as any other<br>
individual must stop.  To not stop it is paramount admitting as a<br>
society,  that this society <br>
has not recognized our human  rights of existence  from the beginning of<br>
this nation as being equal<br>
as any other white, black, hispanic, or any other race in this nation or <br>
world. <br>
<p>
 You know,  I Kind of thought this nation was getting a handle on how to<br>
stop being racist pigs,<br>
 but maybe I was wrong!  I guess that time will tell!<br>
<p>
I think it's time that all human clone twins pull together to fight this<br>
issue.  We may,  just like the blacks<br>
hispanics, and other races,  need to fight it out in the courts regarding<br>
our rights of existence and procreation.<br>
<p>
 If other non-clone people can have normal non-clone babies in a way the<br>
see fit,  so can we have normal<br>
(to us) clone babies no matter how many clones we choose to make in the<br>
same ways they do.<br>
 We have a right to create offspring,  that of our own clone  selves. <br>
This is our Nature!   We have lots of<br>
 common-law jurisprudence to back us up in  any court of the land.<br>
<p>
All identical twins,  like it or not,  are "The People or (race) Of<br>
Clone"!    To be a Clone, is to be Human!<br>
<p>
If other people can have test-tube babies,  we should have these rights<br>
also.  And if our offspring is just like <br>
us,  born a human clone just like we were born (a clone),  well,  that's<br>
our natural right.  We have always had <br>
that right,  and no one can take that right away from us without an<br>
enormous  fight.  Even if we loose a fight <br>
in the courts,  no person (or judge) or country  can take the right from<br>
us.  The right is inate!  Inalliable unto<br>
our very own  beings,  just as our right to life,  happiness religious<br>
freedom and liberty is!<br>
<p>
*******  Any other human clone twins out there and their parents,  who<br>
would like to come together with me to form<br>
a potential class action civil and criminal prosecutions of  "all<br>
opposition" to our rights of existence as a people,<br>
and free abilities to reproduce other clones naturally or otherwise, <br>
being recognized the same  as normal people,  please<br>
send me your name,  address phone number,  and email#,  and let me know<br>
how much funds you will pledge<br>
to this fighting cause  if needed. ********<br>
<p>
Just to let you know, If we have to go to court to fight for these<br>
rights,  there will be a heafty cost,  and I will expect all<br>
people enjoining the court action cause to participate in the funding.<br>
<p>
The blacks had to do it,<br>
The homosexuals had to do it,<br>
Peoples of many religions had to do it,<br>
<p>
I guess it looks as though we will probably have to do it too.  (Fight<br>
for our rights in court!)<br>
