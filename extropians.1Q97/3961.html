The most important reason to listen to critics is: you might be wrong.<br>
	---Robin Hanson<br>
<p>
Bethink ye, by the bowels of Christ, ye may be wrong!<br>
	---Oliver Cromwell (more or less)<br>
<p>
On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament!], <br>
`Pray, Mr.Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will <br>
the right answers come out?'  I am not able rightly to apprehend <br>
the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.  <br>
	---Charles Babbage<br>
<p>
There's a wisdom in the teachings of the old familiar songs, <br>
and a sorrow in repeating all the old familiar wrongs, <br>
and a lesson to be learned, though I've known all along. <br>
	---Janis Ian<br>
<p>
We must make it clear that tolerance does not mean neutrality between <br>
love and cruelty, between peace and violence, between right and wrong.  <br>
	---Robert Dole 95/5/31<br>
<p>
History repeats itself. That's one of the things wrong with history.  <br>
	---Clarence Darrow<br>
<p>
No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but <br>
names very readily transferable to that or this: the only right is what <br>
is after my constitution; the only wrong what is against it....<br>
	---Ralph Waldo Emerson: "Self-Reliance"<br>
<p>
That theory is worthless.  It isn't even wrong!  <br>
	---Wolfgang Pauli [quoted by Marvin Minsky]<br>
