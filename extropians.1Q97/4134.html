Anders Sandberg responded:<br>
<i>&gt; What do you base this assertion on?</i><br>
<p>
Can you merely program a computer to see without creating optical<br>
hardware? No! You can program pattern recognizing neural nets day in and<br>
day out, but until you give the computer hardware [optics] to see with,<br>
it cannot see ... no matter how hard you try to program it to do so.<br>
<p>
Can you merely program a robot to walk? No! You have to give the thing<br>
"legs" if you want it to walk, or wheels if you want it to roll. No<br>
matter how much time you invest in programming a computer to either walk<br>
or roll, that computer will do neither without the required hardware.<br>
<p>
Can you merely program a computer to verbally talk? No! You have to give<br>
the thing speakers or some other sort of vocal apparatus.<br>
<p>
Can you ... ad infinitum<br>
<p>
Emotions are felt in a physical manner. I *feel* sexual pleasure via my<br>
organs. I *feel* hunger via my organs. I *feel* excitement via my<br>
organs. Without this specialized hardware I would *feel* nothing. As a<br>
computer I might be "aware" of conditions, but I would not *feel* those<br>
conditions unless someone created specialized hardware that would allow<br>
me to *feel*.<br>
<p>
If a computer is to feel pleasure from the outside world it will require<br>
peripheal nodes which can register sensation (pleasure and pain). If a<br>
computer is to feel pleasure from its own internal processes it will<br>
require internal nodes which can register sensation (pleasure and pain). <br>
We can program computers to think because that is what the hardware was<br>
designed for. The hardware has not yet been designed to feel emotion.   <br>
I imagine emotions will be incredably easy to program once we have the<br>
enabling technology that allows computers to feel. But first there must<br>
be an interest in doing so. <br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
