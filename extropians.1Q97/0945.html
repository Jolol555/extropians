A strict practitioner of memetics would say that a mutation of Extropianism<br>
would have to have to colonize new carriers were it to survive.  Such<br>
colonization can take place via beneficent symbiosis ("popularity") or<br>
destructive parasitism ("infection").<br>
<p>
As currently formulated, Extropianism offers a close fit with its carriers'<br>
other meme-sets, such as the will to survive and the love of intelligence.<br>
 Some of these native meme-sets run quite deep in humans.  That Extropianism<br>
satisfies our inborn goals makes it useful, satisfying, and justifiably<br>
popular.<br>
<p>
A mutant Extropianism, however, might drain its carriers dry of life--but not<br>
before they cast the mutant meme on to other carriers.  Ebola-like, such a<br>
"Hextropian" cult could burn through an ill-prepared population.  I thus<br>
regard parasitical mutant Extropianism as a real threat.<br>
<p>
As innoculation, I offer humor.  See, for example, "Previously Unpublished<br>
Silliness" at &lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/T0Mpage.HTML">http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/T0Mpage.HTML</a>&gt;.  If Extropians<br>
take themselves too seriously, others will not take them seriously at all.<br>
