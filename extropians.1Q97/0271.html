I hadn't heard of this neural network system before. Sounds intriguing. Is<br>
it hype?<br>

TORONTO (Jan 6, 1997 00:24 a.m. EST) -- In a cramped office overlooking Bay<br>
Street, with wires snaking across the floor and cardboard boxes stacked on<br>
chairs, John Sutherland seems to possess technology's holy grail: a computer<br>
that thinks like a person.<br>
<p>
Dr. Sutherland, president of AND Corp., has created a new type of computing<br>
that he calls holographic neural technology, and some of the people using<br>
the new technology say its implications are staggering, perhaps even<br>
frightening.<br>
<p>
What Dr. Sutherland has developed is a software program called HNet, which<br>
is his own unique approach to neural network technology.<br>
<p>
Neural networks -- software designed to recognize patterns and to learn from<br>
the input of stimuli -- have been around for many years. They have been the<br>
focus of countless billions of dollars in research and development, most<br>
notably in Japan, but by most standards they have been a commercial failure.<br>
<p>
What makes his neural technology different, Dr. Sutherland said, is that it<br>
more accurately mimics the way the human brain works.<br>
<p>
His corporate clients say what makes it different is that it is blazingly<br>
fast, able to reduce complex analytical computing chores from taking days to<br>
minutes. That, they say, gives it a mind-boggling potential to be put to<br>
work in countless industries.<br>
<p>
"It's a very unique and extremely powerful technology," said Dr. Andrew<br>
Maziarzewski, a researcher at the Clinton, N.J.-based engineering firm<br>
Foster Wheeler Corp. He has worked with the HNet technology at the giant<br>
Swiss engineering firm Asea Brown Boveri Inc.<br>
<p>
Dr. Maziarzewski said he has used other neural network programs but none<br>
come close to the speed of HNet.<br>
<p>
Dr. Sutherland, who speaks in the carefully measured tones of a scientist,<br>
believes HNet has incredible implications for virtually every aspect of<br>
industry.<br>
<p>
He said it can be used to control any manufacturing or chemical process;<br>
predict consumer behavior in any market segment; analyze financial markets'<br>
patterns and predict future market behavior; identify, command and control<br>
military operations; recognize and identify medical conditions; and<br>
recognize faces, voices and handwriting.<br>
<p>
"In the next few years ... we'll see systems for voice recognition, for<br>
autonomously piloted planes, and other vehicles. We'll see machine=<br>
 cognition."<br>
<p>
Machine cognition? Machines that can actually think, feel and react?<br>
<p>
A cognitive system is one that has enormous storage capacity and that will<br>
continually learn and retain all its information, Dr. Sutherland explained,<br>
adding that that's what his technology does. It learns patterns from the<br>
information put into it, almost instantaneously.<br>
<p>
But will such a cognitive machine be truly a thinking machine? We tend to<br>
think of cognition -- the act of knowing or perceiving -- as a skill linked<br>
to emotion and used for survival.<br>
<p>
"I'm a hard scientist and that type of functioning (having emotions and a<br>
survival instinct) is in fact based on scientific functioning, on the<br>
interaction of information and the storage of information" in biological<br>
cells, Dr. Sutherland said.<br>
<p>
That's his way of saying yes, a machine might be able to think=<br>
 independently.<br>
<p>
It may be too great a stretch for most people to imagine such a thinking<br>
machine, but Dr. Sutherland has already built one that sees and recognizes<br>
specific faces.<br>
<p>
It took him less than two months, using HNet, to create the program that<br>
recognizes individual faces. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of<br>
Technology spent millions of dollars and struggled for years to build a<br>
face-recognition system, but it only recognizes faces if they are motionless<br>
and shown head on.<br>
<p>
Dr. Sutherland's system can recognize people as they walk by, with their<br>
faces at any angle. Training it to recognize a visiting journalist's face<br>
took a few seconds.<br>
<p>
The potential applications are immense.<br>
<p>
The U.S. military has expressed an interest in the face-recognition system.<br>
If installed in every major airport in the world and connected to law<br>
enforcement authorities, for example, it could be used to track terrorists<br>
and other criminals in real time.<br>
<p>
Dr. Sutherland would rather talk about the medical applications. He said his<br>
system can be used to recognize the various components of blood and tissue,<br>
and render instant diagnoses in case of problems.<br>
<p>
HNet has been trained to look for electromagnetic "signatures" from the<br>
Earth, which would enable it to locate mineral deposits or other underground<br>
deposits.<br>
<p>
Because it has been able to learn the fundamentals of electromagnetic<br>
interaction, Dr. Sutherland believes his system can learn and simulate<br>
atomic-level interactions, which would enable it to quickly perform the kind<br>
of complex simulations used in creating nanotechnology, or microscopic<br>
structures.<br>
<p>
"We don't really have the final word on how good this will be but this looks<br>
very, very promising," said Dr. Ligang Zheng, a research scientist at<br>
Canada's Department of Natural Resources' Energy Diversification Research<br>
Laboratory in Ottawa, which is trying to use HNet to control the mechanical<br>
and chemical processes at a garbage-to-energy incinerator in Burnaby, B.C.<br>
<p>
Charles Murphy, a programmer with Oxford Information Inc. of Hagaman, N.Y.,<br>
offers a slightly less glowing but still positive review.<br>
<p>
Oxford uses HNet and other neural network software to perform statistical<br>
analyses of markets, and fraud detection for some of its bank customers.<br>
<p>
"Sometimes HNet is just what we needed," Murphy said. "It's comparable (to<br>
traditional neural technology), sometimes better; sometimes traditional<br>
(technology) will beat it. It's always worth trying."<br>
<p>
In contrast, Steve Verba is one of HNet's and Dr. Sutherland's greatest<br>
fans. As chief information officer at Realty One in Cleveland, one of the<br>
largest U.S. realty brokers, Mr. Verba said he's been working with<br>
traditional neural network technology for more than 10 years, but what Dr.<br>
Sutherland has done is light years ahead.<br>
<p>
"This guy may die penniless but this will profoundly influence life in the<br>
21st century, whether he gets credit for it or not," Mr. Verba said.<br>
<p>
"I believe he should get the Nobel Prize and I'm not exaggerating," he said.<br>
"I've read the work of guys who have gotten Nobel Prizes in other fields<br>
that weren't even close to the profundity of what he's laid out here."<br>
