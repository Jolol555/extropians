Since Kathryn alluded to our get-together in a message the other day, I <br>
thought I'd post a brief summary.  I'm cc'ing this to the main list in <br>
the hopes that it will serve as an inspiration for other Extropians to <br>
get together and for those in the DC area to subscribe to the Extropians <br>
East list.<br>
<p>
Several of us in the Washington, DC area got together this past Saturday <br>
night for dinner in Alexandria, Virginia.  In attendance were Kathryn <br>
Aegis, Douglas Houts, Mark Crosby, Simon Levy, and me (John <br>
Blanco-Losada).  Tom Morrow even made a surprise appearance!<br>
<p>
This was basically a meet &amp; greet session for us to get to know one <br>
another beyond our usual email interactions.  Aside from learning what <br>
each of us does "in real life," we didn't have any Singularity-causing <br>
revelations, but we did have an extended discussion about our favorite <br>
cartoons.  All in all it was a very enjoyable evening, and I encourage <br>
other Extropians to make an effort to meet one another.  We hope to <br>
gather again, probably around some local event of Extropian interest.<br>
