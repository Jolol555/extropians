<i>&gt; Maybe its me, but all of the people I talk to from New Zealand on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; net seem to have varying degrees of this socialist memeplex of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "capitalism is evil" propaganda. The big confusion people who condemn</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism because of its supposed evil impacts have seems to be that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they confuse capitalism with mercantilism, as many have noted here in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the past. Not only is this the result of decades of communist</i><br>
<i>&gt; propaganda, but also the overt behavior of mercantilists who trot around</i><br>
<i>&gt; claiming to be capitalists. Kind of like the Republican party, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; tends to run around claiming to believe in libertarian principles, yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't ever seem to vote for any REAL libertarian proposals.</i><br>
<p>
You might be asking if current systems can withstand scrutiny. I claim they<br>
can and show this below. Obfuscating definitions may be your way of<br>
dissembling meaning. I don't disguise the Hegelian dialectic that I see you<br>
using to evade the issue. That is simply stated as:<br>
<p>
(1) The need to keep harnessing everything and everyone by a limited<br>
communication system that uses instrumental value instead of a suitably<br>
estimated intrinsic value. Things don't have to balance to zero you know.<br>
Things don't have to balance at all. There are such things as "below the<br>
bottom line" items. Gambling is such an activity. A declaration in deficit<br>
accounting is such an item and as such is measurable against standards of<br>
activity. Control of the worldwide stability of these imbalances is easily<br>
established.<br>
<p>
(2) An artificial intelligence produced "below the bottom line item" could<br>
be created in a controlled manner by, say, historically retiring a random<br>
historical time period uniformly over all banking computers everywhere,<br>
from every event file and then all balances get recalculated and reset as<br>
needed. What you would have is still a fully functional worldwide system<br>
but each person would have a reconciliation entry "below the bottom line"<br>
to bring them back to zero. In this highly controllable environment some<br>
will gain and some will loose but will still remain the same till the next<br>
random hit on a days worth of world wide information. <br>
<p>
(3) Soon banking will loose its grip and the ability to charge interest<br>
will cease, because how can you inflate an intrinsic group value; - but the<br>
systems are perfected. Tort will become unheard of because of the alibi<br>
inside our total recall exoselves. The system strength will grow in by<br>
repairing itself. This will be cause for fun. Recruits get all the total<br>
recall experience and show will power to record and teach everything.<br>
Prisoners will be trained to get what they want using the "below the bottom<br>
line" method and will have limited motivation to rob and murder as they do<br>
now, sometimes within hours of release.<br>
<p>
(3) One system will evolve and one won't. We are experiencing shifting to a<br>
worldwide intrinsic accounting system. Agree this is as natural as the<br>
world of printed books giving way to digital books. Thus, we get to keep<br>
the best of systems science and remove the shield of privacy from the worst<br>
of predatory human nature; - as expressed in a glaring structural fault in<br>
the price system. <br>
<p>
(4) The "anything box", "the 2000 bug" and others are coming and we should<br>
examine every contingency to stave off a disaster, including this one. So I<br>
guess the money days should be gradually gone just before the "anything<br>
box" arrives to an expectant population. <br>
<p>
	(a) Select the 2000 bug, for example, and make a public accounting entry<br>
okaying the miscalculations. <br>
	(b) The errors will go away anyway handled this way, btw. <br>
	(c) There could even be lottery tickets for the "error of the day" winner<br>
as everyone can see it. 	(d) However and this is the reality of the present<br>
group-think about instrumental value is that one doesn't realize the<br>
creation of even gratuitous costs is an increase in the overall "scarcity<br>
de-coupled" money supply, obtainable by the "print for a fee," privately<br>
run, central banksters. <br>
	(e) See that a shackled prisoner going to jail instead of to a park-bench<br>
really does increase an instrumentally valued economy rather than<br>
impoverish it. Think of all the commercial activity surrounding the<br>
incarceration.<br>
	(f) Your indignant cry about costs is hiding a disguised permission<br>
control system and has nothing to do with future realities.  <br>
	(f) All national debt is a joke to frighten the mundanes and in a<br>
mind-control way stop them from seeing the shysters for what they are.<br>
<p>
(5) A next step could be public spirited and enthusiastic acceptance of the<br>
inner workings of this approach. Public emergency drills could be held to<br>
measure for effectiveness and preparedness for the "anything box." This<br>
won't sound anything like a totalitarian approach because the "fire drills"<br>
will be only for those aided into the program, which is everyone who loses<br>
old transactions in the fire drills. The money-users like the printed<br>
book-users will fade away. It is important to note that real-time<br>
implementation problems presented by these "fire drills" come only after<br>
stage (1). <br>
<p>

Best,<br>
