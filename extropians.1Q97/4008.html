Robin Hanson, hanson@hss.caltech.edu, writes:<br>
<i>&gt; There are lots of explicit models of situations like these, most but</i><br>
<i>&gt; not all using Bayesian inference, and the robust result is that other</i><br>
<i>&gt; people's opinions should be given a lot of weight, typically much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the weight given to your personal experience.  In fact, it turns</i><br>
<i>&gt; out to be difficult to explain persistent divergence in opinions. </i><br>
<p>
I thought this was the crux of Robin's post, and it is a very surprising<br>
result to me.  However it seems hard to frame the question cleanly.  One<br>
could ask, in most areas where there is a difference of opinion among<br>
people, is the majority or the minority more likely to be correct?  It<br>
would not be surprising if the answer were that the majority was more<br>
often right.  However this would not establish that I should give more<br>
weight to others than to my own experience, because I may not be typical<br>
of average minority members.  I'd like to hear more about the kinds of<br>
reasoning or studies which lead to the conclusion above.<br>
<p>
As Robin indicates in his last sentence, there is even the germ of a<br>
contradiction here:<br>
<p>
If the opinions of other people are really very valuable and generally<br>
an accurate indicator of reality, then I should be well to copy many or<br>
most of their opinions.  In particular, I should copy people's habits<br>
of giving credence to other people's opinions.  But, it seems to me that<br>
most people aren't that easily persuaded by other people's opinions when<br>
they disagree on some issue.  So if I copy that behavior then I shouldn't<br>
rely that much on other people's opinions, contradicting the conclusion<br>
that I should.<br>
<p>
Of course, this rests on my claim that most people prefer to decide<br>
for themselves rather than listen to other people.  It could be that I<br>
have mostly associated with individuals who are unusual in this regard,<br>
or I could simply be mistaken in my perceptions.  Perhaps I am focusing on<br>
just those areas where they differ, ignoring the vast body of accumulated<br>
knowledge which everyone shares.  Or maybe people like to exaggerate<br>
their uniqueness and downplay the extent to which they follow the crowd,<br>
for cultural reasons.<br>
