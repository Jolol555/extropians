<p>
But since open to interpretation the statement of an artist is a statement<br>
of conditionS, stateS of mind, statusES of society.<br>

'Perceive' is the key here: this would be a perception; an interpretation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Its</i><br>

<p>
Art is the professor of multiple truths, in that it cannot be shackled by<br>
the artist. It reveals multiple possible fixations, pleasures, motivations<br>
and general concerns through the multitude of things which it may be<br>
interpreted as representing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The aesthetic runs through</i><br>
<i>&gt;and directs the technology. Technology exists for the sake of art ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;that which pleases us.</i><br>
<p>
I've never found iron lungs or dialysis machines particularly aesthetically<br>
pleasing. Equally, I'm not convinced that flint tools or spears came in to<br>
use because they looked good: they were pleasing because they got food. Do<br>
you define art as that which pleases us in any way (e.g. by saving our<br>
lives)? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We create the technology because our</i><br>
<i>&gt;pscychological [creative] condition necessitates it, and then the art</i><br>
<i>&gt;reveals the condition itself.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that art reveals our creative condition. On the other hand, what<br>
demonstrates that this condition causes us to create technology, rather<br>
than merely facilitating such creation, driven by a desire to survive?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Thus [objectively] the importance of the artist is the artist's </i><br>
<i>&gt;revalatory capacity.</i><br>
<p>
Revalation is not objective. The artist has to reveal to someone (even if<br>
that is the artist her/himself), and that requires subjective observation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The importance of a society's art is that arts</i><br>
<i>&gt;revealing of its society.</i><br>
<p>
Art may serve just as an important role in shaping the society, as in<br>
revealing it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We create a system, and as members of that system we generate art, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;if that art shows problematic signs of neurosis, then we can and should</i><br>
<i>&gt;rethink the system. This is how the artist truely questions and further</i><br>
<i>&gt;aids to define that which is represented. </i><br>
<p>
I presume your talking about 'art' collectively here: the art of one artist<br>
could just be a result of his/her own neuroses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Art is the ergonomics of technology. It is how the technology "fits" the</i><br>
<i>&gt;people. It is an ecquisitely insightful reflection of the people.  </i><br>
<p>
As a reflection of people art is only as insightful as those who interpret it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Subjectively: Art is the manifestation of our pleasures.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Objectively: Art is the status of our condition.</i><br>
<p>
You're going to have explain your meanings of subjective and objective<br>
before I make sense of those two statements. But, either way, art is merely<br>
an interpretation of our pleasures, and an interpretation of the status of<br>
our condition (both by artist _and_ observer).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Art can only aid in the self-definition of an organization to the degree</i><br>
<i>&gt;in which that organization is sufficiently aware of art's reflexive</i><br>
<i>&gt;capacity. To the degree that an organization uses art reflectively, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;that degree will art define the organization.</i><br>
<p>
True. I was more concerned with external, than self-definition. The actual<br>
use of art as a reflector is as much a function of the observer's<br>
interpretation as it is of the artist's intent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Thus, what role should art play in Extropian thought?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subjectively: It should take full advantage of cutting edge technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt;to manifest our refined pleasures, which includes the expression and</i><br>
<i>&gt;transmittance of Extropic memes, a certain pleasure, while seeding</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest in the development of new technologies which will further</i><br>
<i>&gt;enable the manifestation of our progressively evolving pleasures.   </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Objectively: It should be persistently analysed in order to access and</i><br>
<i>&gt;refine the psychological condition and ramifications of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;organization. [This is the responsibility factor; self-evaluation.]</i><br>
<p>
Back to the subject/objective dichotomy. What do you mean by this? Your<br>
definition of a subjective role may be correct, but at most you describe<br>
what Extropic art _should_ aim to do. You can never define what it _does_<br>
do, more than saying the majority of people will interpret a piece in a<br>
certain way (after its display), or that you expect them to so interpret it<br>
(before its display).<br>
<p>
Your objective definition seems to propose an 'objective' analyser. But<br>
since this is self-evaluation, how can it be objective? That means all<br>
creators of art would be objective, and yet I'm sure they would disagree<br>
with each other. Unless by self-evaluation you mean evaluation by<br>
'Extropians': but again, such a homogenous interpretation is unlikely,<br>
probably impossible, within such a group.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The latter [objective] use of art should be expected from any</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual, organization, nation, or society. Its merely a refined sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;of self-awareness.</i><br>
<p>
But my self-awareness is not objective, is it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One last quick statement on censorship. Censorship is a denial of</i><br>
<i>&gt;problematic symptoms.</i><br>
<p>
I don't agree. Firstly, you cannot define a symptom as universally<br>
'problematic'. At most you can say that censorship is a denial of syptoms<br>
considered problematic by the censor. But then, how can that be a denial.<br>
It is not a denial of the symptoms at all, merely an action designed to<br>
suppress those symptoms. (It _may_ be a denial of the underlying _causes_<br>
of the symptoms.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Censorship itself is a symptom of an organization</i><br>
<i>&gt;or society which is unwilling to take responsibility for that which it</i><br>
<i>&gt;manifests.</i><br>
<p>
You're personifying 'organization' and 'society'. In fact, it seems<br>
unlikely that the society or organization would both manifest and censor<br>
the art. If the organization or society has control over censorship one<br>
would have thought it would prevent production. The point is that within an<br>
organization or society there are individuals, and it is difference between<br>
the thoughts and relative powers of these individuals which allows<br>
censorship to occur.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Censorship may put a bandage over art, but the "pimples" will</i><br>
<i>&gt;continue to emerge and inflame until the organization accepts its</i><br>
<i>&gt;responsibility in initiating that which is the cause of the art,</i><br>
<p>
Surely that which is the cause of the censored art has already been<br>
initiated, even if that cause is stated as a negative. That is to say, even<br>
if the cause is non-performance by the organization, that non-performance<br>
is an initiated cause. The organization (by which _I_ mean those with power<br>
to effect change) may respond to the art, and hence to the cause of the<br>
art; it doesn't initiate that cause.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and</i><br>
<i>&gt;thus when that organization seeks something greater than a topical</i><br>
<i>&gt;solution. The alternative to censorship is acceptance of responsibility,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and re-assessment of idealogy.</i><br>
<p>
What if the outcome of such acceptance and responsibility is a decision<br>
that censorship is the best mode of action? (e.g. Making child pornography<br>
illegal, effectively censoring it, doesn't seem such a bad thing to me, and<br>
many others, even when I accept my responsibility and re-assess my ideology.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Art which tests the limits of our experience, tests and redefines the</i><br>
<i>&gt;limits of our existence.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Explore and play!</i><br>
<p>
OK.<br>
