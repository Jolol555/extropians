This might require an extremly open mind.<br>
<p>
I feel because my brain thinks I feel and not because my "body" feels it.<br>
<p>
EXPERIMENT:<br>
 1)Close your eyes.<br>
 2)Extend your arms.<br>
 3)Scratch your palm for a bit.<br>
<p>
Your hand is not feeling that. <br>
Your brain is. <br>
<p>
Think about that for a minute, I'll wait...<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Why does my brain think I have I body when all I feel is in my brain?<br>
<p>
If I considered my body a part of my brain I could understand feeling my body;<br>
 but then if all I feel is within the boundry of my body,<br>
 why do I think my body is on Earth; <br>
 unless the earth is a part of my body;<br>
 and if all the things I thought were outside of my body<br>
 are really a part of my body,<br>
 I must be the universe.<br>
<p>
I am the whole of my reality.<br>
<p>
I once asked,"What is reality?".<br>
To which some one replied,"What are you?".<br>
<p>
I think it is strange of me to think of something that abstract<br>
with such perfect timing.<br>
