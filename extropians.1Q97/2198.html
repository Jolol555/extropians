Welcome to the List!  I think you may be pleasantly surprised at the extent<br>
to which transhumanists in general and extropians in particular are<br>
sensitized to the scientific, social and aesthetic issues of our relationship<br>
to nature.  As long-time ExList denizens know, this is one of my key<br>
interests in extropianism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [snip some good personal observations about environmental quality]</i><br>
<i>&gt; I just wonder if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  dystopian futuristic visions of a sort of Blade Runner type landscape is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  what we can realistically expect or will the new technologies change the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  present resource consumption patterns that cause forests to be clear cut</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and through the extraction of fossil fuels cause Exxon Valdezes ?  Will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  biotechnology find new ways to feed humans so we don't have to overfish</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the seas causing depletion of fish such as I heard has happened at one</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of my favorite resorts in Perce on the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec?  Will</i><br>
<i>&gt;  there be a future in which a wide diversity of flora and fauna exists</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and also megafauna such as grizzly bears can make a comeback?  Or do</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Extropian posthumans value this type of wild nature? </i><br>
<i>&gt;  [more snips]</i><br>
<i>&gt;  How does a posthuman view a grizzly bear?  Does the grizzly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  bear have a right to exist:  large expanses of wild uninhabited land in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  which to roam?     </i><br>
<p>
To me these are _very_ important and apt questions for extropians and the<br>
transhumanist community.  They cause us to look at our core values and at the<br>
specific technologies we choose to use to augment our power in -- and over --<br>
nature.  As I've written before, I find Anders' "complexity ethic" to be near<br>
the starting point for a definition of extropian attitudes toward nature.  As<br>
Anders wrote on 97-02-03 07:17:55 EST:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In my personal ethical system, I regard complex, diverse systems as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fundamental good (this is a completely arbitrary basis, but it works quite</i><br>
<i>&gt;  well). This of course implies that a biosphere is something *very*</i><br>
<i>&gt;  valuable, and that keeping it viable and diverse is an ethical act. It</i><br>
<i>&gt;  also implies that ideally, I should not interfere in it to decrease its</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (long run) diversity, and that to achieve this I should also try to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  convince others about the same thing (see the meme? :-).</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure, however, that this is an "arbitrary" value, in the sense that<br>
valuing complex ecosystems may stem inevitably from the same, more<br>
fundamental "goods" we must hold to value human and trans- and post-human<br>
life.  (This gets into my long-range goal of developing an ethical system<br>
based on fundamental valuation of information processing -- knowers and<br>
knowledge -- very much a work in progress and incomplete . . .)<br>
<p>
As I have written elsewhere:<br>
<p>
"For now, at least, Earth is the only planet of which we are aware that has<br>
spontaneously generated a rich biosphere.  This phenomenon is scarce.  Raw<br>
materials for an industrial society that can be found elsewhere than on/in<br>
this planet, on the other hand, are not.  Earth constitutes a tiny fraction<br>
of the mass of the solar system.  Even with the primitive survey of the solar<br>
system we have already made, we know we can find and exploit elsewhere the<br>
resources that an expanding industrial civilization needs."<br>
<p>
"Extropian environmentalism places a high value on the living wilderness<br>
simply because it is rare and options exist and more will exist for the<br>
continued technological development of consciousness other than consuming<br>
those living wilderness zones.  This does not place an unreasonably absolute<br>
value on living wilderness, but simply makes preserving it as much as<br>
possible one value among many, albeit a great value.  Preserving living<br>
terran wilderness zones is consistent with the value of spontaneous order<br>
simply because life on this planet is, so far, the most complex example of<br>
this phenomenon of which we are aware.  If for no other reason, mere<br>
curiosity about spontaneous order should lead us to interact with at least<br>
some of these zones as little as possible, at least until we better<br>
understand the processes that gave rise to them and by which they continue to<br>
operate."<br>

which can be found at:<br>

         <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch1/exenv.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch1/exenv.html</a><br>
<p>
Any list members interested in these questions are welcome to visit that site<br>
and -- more important -- to send me materials and links they believe may be<br>
appropriate for inclusion there.<br>
<p>
And, as I mentioned here recently, no better exposition of an extropian<br>
approach to environmental issues can be found than Wallace Kaufman's book,<br>
"No Turning Back".  Again, I highly recommend that book for anyone interested<br>
in the ultimate questions of our changing relationship to nature.<br>
<p>
Finally, anyone interested in these questions may also be interested in<br>
coming along on the extropians backpacking trip I'm organizing for the July<br>
4th holiday, dubbed "Expedition 97."  While the trip doesn't have a "theme"<br>
by any means, I'm sure these topics will come up around the campfire.  The<br>
Expedition 97 web page can be found at:<br>

<p>
Included in that site is a list of folks who have already expressed an<br>
interest in going on the trip.<br>
