I agree with that there are cases where madness can be led back to medical<br>
arguments. (in the case later caused damage, not of genetical arguments<br>
against people who are fully 'functional' otherwise) <br>
<p>
I agree with that foucaults definitions of madness can't be explained from<br>
a purely social point of view, allthough i'd put the blame on nation states<br>
rather than just democracies seen the examples that occurred after 1914 in<br>
non-democratic states.  <br>
<p>
I also agree that for examples involving homosexuals long after 1914, other<br>
arguments can be found than purely social ones. <br>
<p>
I just hope those arguments will not be used to limit individual freedom.<br>
<p>
A) Homosexuality, and other behaviour that is or was once considered a<br>
'deviation' can be led back 'somewhat' to genetical influence.<br>
<p>
B) Criminal behaviour can also.<br>
<p>
I'd like to think that the second we are born into this world, we become an<br>
individual, influencing the effect that code will have on us, whatever our<br>
genetical 'deviations' may be. And that our genetical influences can be<br>
overcome, SHOULD WE WISH THAT. Based on individual choice, for all cases<br>
where our behaviour is not damaging to others (A is not, B is).<br>
<p>
Problems like these still exist today in the case of pedofilian<br>
relationships. It all depends on our points of view on when we accept<br>
individuals (note: not agegroups, individual cases) to be responsible<br>
enough to take their own decisions. <br>
<p>
Another example are gender 'deviations' and our societies pressure to make<br>
them conform to the two sexes system. (horrible medical stories!)<br>
<p>
Then again they're not my problem, so why should i worry about them, right<br>
? ;-)<br>
