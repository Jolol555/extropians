Watched Solo the other day...<br>
Pretty cheesy movie about a military AI that has feelings and ethics (altough<br>
apparently his designer does not) and rescues thrid world Indians from some<br>
Castro types...I think he is a libertarian though, cause there's a funny<br>
little line about him doing it "for a trade". ( no Altruist, this borg)<br>
Mario is sure pretty , is he taking steriods or is that all natural?<br>
<p>
All in all a really bad film, but one thing I loved was this creature- even<br>
though he was a weapon by design, once he had his free will chip ( or<br>
whatever happens) he spent all his spare time designing and drawing -<br>
replicas of spiders, and other master designs of nature.. <br>
I often speculate that AI's ( if they get freewill)  will be mostly artists,<br>
industrial designers,  and inventors, focusing on design, design and more<br>
design...<br>
