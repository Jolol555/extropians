<i>&gt;My parents saw I was getting mail from Lucifer.com </i><br>
<i>&gt; and now they think I'm in league with the devil!</i><br>
<i>&gt;A God-talking preacher friend of thiers outraged me to the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt;obscenity   with a conversation whose sole purpose seemed to be to get me to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do what my  parents wanted. </i><br>
<i>&gt;They are threatening to cut off the computer (this computer)</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the internet because they think it is Satanic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I AM NOT JOKING!</i><br>
<i>&gt;The internet is my main source of communication.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Losing it would EXTREMELY limit my Transhuman/Extropian efforts </i><br>
<i>&gt; which would lessen the length and quality of my life and happiness.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have been raised to be dependant upon them </i><br>
<i>&gt; and would have a difficult time claiming my independance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have been denied access to and control of my assets.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have been threatened with homelessness.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I fear for my health and safety.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am sovereign and have declared that publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt; (not that many people would believe me)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and any legal action would be under international jurisdiction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;My life is a mess.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;WHAT CAN I DO?!</i><br>
<p>
Man, and I thought my parents were religious fanatics. Hope they don't<br>
exercise you or your computer. Where do you live? In a highly religious<br>
community? Hey Anders, any counter-memes we can throw together to help this<br>
guy out? Lucifer.com thats SOOO pathetic. Hey man, they we're going to snap<br>
on something and unfortunetly it just happened to be you. You could try<br>
getting a Hotmail free email account at www.hotmail.com so you can access<br>
your email through the web and subscribe the mailinglists to that instead<br>
so that if your parents go to read the email they won't find it sitting on<br>
your computer. Also you can look to www.geocities.com for free email<br>
accounts and 1MB of webspace. The geocities free email account uses a POP<br>
server so you can use it with email software like Eudora, Microsoft Mail or<br>
Netscape Mail. I know where you can get text-based shell accounts for email<br>
as well. I've already been through a less dramatic version of what you're<br>
going through. If you feel the need, call me at (310)374-5543. I'm here for<br>
yah man.<br>
