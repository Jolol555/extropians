Intriguing, captain.  I discussed some of these issues in the introduction<br>
to my book READING BY STARLIGHT:<br>
<p>
"In an effort to break free of both self-validating and self-defeating<br>
mechanisms of discourse, I have drawn inspiration from a fertile speculation<br>
advanced by the philosopher Elizabeth Grosz, who lists the likely outcomes<br>
of the confrontation between traditional phallocognitive philosophy and<br>
feminist critique and construction of an alternative procedure.<br>
Confrontations of this kind are by no means purely iconoclastic.  As<br>
Genevieve Lloyd observes: `Such criticisms of ideals of Reason can in fact<br>
be seen as continuous with a very old strand in the western philosophical<br>
tradition; it has been centrally concerned with bringing to reflective<br>
awareness the deeper structures of inherited ideals of Reason.'<br>
		<br>
"While Grosz writes specifically of a new feminist philosophy, I take her<br>
observations to have a certain general validity.  The new critical<br>
philosophy diverges in several important ways from previously canonised<br>
approaches.  Hardly monolithic, or orchestrated around a `transcendental<br>
signified', it is neither relativist or pluralist but perspectivist:<br>
`acknowledg[ing] other points of view but den[ying] them equal value'. 		<br>
<p>
"That is, it asserts commitment without falling into coercive univocity or<br>
undecidable agnosticism.  This approach, born under the sign of<br>
poststructuralism but hardly identical with it, deviates from the Western<br>
tradition in a crucial break:  `[I]t can openly accept its own status (and<br>
that of all discourses) as context-specific.'  Perspectivism can openly avow<br>
its own political position: `all texts speak from or represent particular<br>
positions within power relations...  Instead of aspiring to the status of<br>
truth,' such a philosophy `prefers to see itself as a form of strategy.'<br>
But these strategies are not abstractions.  `Instead of dividing theory from<br>
practice [among many other dichotomous impositions...] philosophy may regard<br>
theory as a form of practice....'  Far from either valorising or condemning<br>
traditional ways of arguing logically from hegemonically-ordained premises,<br>
it `expands the concept of reason' .		<br>
"There are serious difficulties in abandoning boring old forms of logic.<br>
What's more, I am by no means convinced that the program of an expanded<br>
literary, philosophical or scientific discourse can or ought take the step<br>
into the abyss which Grosz proposes (a step which is implicit, admittedly,<br>
in many texts by such poststructuralists as Lacan, Foucault, Derrida and<br>
Baudrillard).  The newly-dimensioned space required to replenish writing and<br>
thinking, Grosz speculates, `may be capable of sustaining several types of<br>
discourse, many perspectives and interests (even contradictory ones).  No<br>
one form dominates the others'.<br>
		<br>
"These are large claims, but their intent is generous, more insistent on a<br>
declaration of a speaker's position, and those of a speaker's opponents,<br>
than to any certified truth; open to a measure of passion and rhetoric<br>
usually regarded within the academy as indecorous at best.<br>
		<br>
"The analytic technique I'm trying to employ in this book is grounded also<br>
in the view that to a much larger extent than is usually understood the<br>
reader constructs her own argument as well as her own text.  This is why I<br>
frequently urge my case by means of collage, sometimes scathingly rather<br>
than coolly framed, displaying exemplary citations alongside each other in a<br>
rhetorically heightened context which presses to a conclusion without<br>
feigning to `prove' it."<br>
<p>
It strikes me that email list discussions automagically take just this<br>
rhetorical-cum-logical form.  :)<br>
