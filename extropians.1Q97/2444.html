<p>
Eliezer, except when you talk about The Singularity I usually disagree with <br>
you and sometimes you make me mad, but I still think you're a fine fellow and <br>
would hate like hell for you to leave the list. I hope you reconsider.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If I identify with reason and act in accordance with reason, I am         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;free.   </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Reason works great in showing you the best way to achieve your goals, but it <br>
is useless in deciding which goal to pick. If I stick my hand in a fire I can <br>
not think of any logical reason to pull it out. I know that the sensation <br>
coming from my hand is painful, but I can't prove it, and even if I could I <br>
certainly can't prove that pleasure is better than pain or life is better<br>
than death or logic is better than illogic. I'm pulling my hand out anyway. <br>
<p>
There are some things  that are beyond logic, some thing that I don't need <br>
to prove to myself, like the fact that I'm conscious, and the fact that I <br>
don't like pain or death. I like logic because it has worked in the past and  <br>
by induction I figure it will work in the future, but of course, I can't <br>
prove induction.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;nor are *all* *systems* possessed of free will, as your</i><br>
<i>        &gt;self-unpredictability definition would have it.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
In general, anything that could make the slightest claim to be intelligent, <br>
even a simple computer program, can not predict what it will do.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don't care where reason comes from.  I don't care if it's        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;evolution-imposed, blank-slate-deduced, or  God-given.  All I care         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;about is if it's true.  </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
I certainly agree with that, but tell me, why isn't, "I scratched my nose  <br>
because I wanted to and I wanted to because it itched", true?<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Reason says to reason also</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Reason says no such thing, it doesn't give a hoot in hell if you're logical  <br>
or not, your emotions says reason has value, my emotions say the same thing <br>
by the way.<br>
<p>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;You decide to do things you don't want to do??? Why do you do them? </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Eliezer:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Because they are justified.          </i><br>
                <br>
<p>
I understand. You "want" to do things that are justified, doing otherwise <br>
would make you unhappy.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don't intend to play word-games here. </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
These are not word games. We are discussing some extremely difficult <br>
questions here, if I am torturing some words to the limits of their meaning  <br>
it is only because it is necessary, these common words were not originally  <br>
designed for such heavy duty use.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There are cognitively real distinctions between want and decide         </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
I'd sure like to know what they are.         <br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What I want to do has no relation to what I have decided to do</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nonsense. Your decision to pick B made you unhappy, but A would have made <br>
you even more unhappy.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;To you, meaning is value.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not so. The soap operas on TV have meaning to me, but they have zero value  <br>
to me.<br>
                    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I've decided that emotions assigning positive value to things is </i><br>
<i>        &gt;not conducive to reaching Singularity.       </i><br>
  <br>
<p>
Rather than debate the validity of your deduction again, I have a more  <br>
fundamental question. Without bringing up emotion or your own personal  <br>
opinion about the value of things, can you tell me why you "want" to reach <br>
the Singularity? I can't.<br>
                        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Maximizing intrinsic value is the only logical basis for a goal         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;system, while observer-arbitrary value is nothing to me.</i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
I've told you exactly what I mean by "subjective value", but after all this <br>
time you still haven't told me what you mean by "intrinsic value". <br>
Just give me a definition, its yours so you can make it anything you want,  <br>
I won't argue with it, provided it's clear and not circular. If you can't do <br>
that at least give me a hint about what you're talking about.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if I somehow shut off the entire emotional system, that would         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;cripple my ability to reason about goals.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
A VAST understatement.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I identify with the head, you with the heart. Under the</i><br>
<i>        &gt;circumstances, our respective philosophies seem a bit ironic.</i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
Sorry, I still don't see it.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What is altruism?        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Is it sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of others?        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Or is it gaining your happiness through the happiness of others?        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I would unconditionally answer #2. </i><br>
                       <br>
<p>
I also would unconditionally answer #2<br>
<p>
