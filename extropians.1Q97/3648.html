A few years ago I read about a technique for seeing through opaque objects <br>
with optical LASER pulses of astronomical intensity but modest  energy, <br>
I remember seeing a picture of a newspaper taken through several inches of <br>
milk, you could still read it. I wonder if a device working on a similar <br>
principle could be used to obtain enough information from a non-destructive <br>
brain scan to upload a mind. <br>
<p>
When most photons that make up an image enter milk they are refracted off the <br>
many fat globules in solution, if any photons come out the other side of the <br>
milk container they have been bounced around so much that the information on <br>
where they originated is hopelessly scrambled, all you would see is a diffuse <br>
glow, not an image. However, a few very lucky photons, perhaps  one in a <br>
billion trillion, perhaps less, can make it through the milk without <br>
interacting with anything. Because these rare photons don't get bounced <br>
around but take a shorter direct path, they are the first photons to emerge <br>
from the milk. If you only looked at those early photons and ignored the much<br>
more numerous later ones, you could see an image and not just a general glow.<br>
<p>
I don't remember the researcher's name or the exact specifications of his <br>
LASER, but I do know that intensities as high as 10^18 watts per square <br>
centimeter and pulses as short as 10-14 seconds have been achieved with table <br>
top LASERS. You'd want to squeeze every bit of information out of the rare <br>
photons that make up the image, so just recording their amplitude, as in<br>
photography, would not be good enough, you'd want to know their phase too, <br>
and that means Holography. As a bonus, you wouldn't have to worry about depth <br>
of field focusing problems, and the reference beam for the Hologram could act <br>
as a super fast camera shutter, use a different frequency for the reference <br>
beam pulse and put in a filter for the original frequency.<br>
<p>
10^14 seconds might be too long for a safe brain scan at the enormous <br>
intensities required, and light can travel about a tenth of a millimeter in <br>
that time, but I'll bet a soft X ray LASER could be built with a lot shorter <br>
pulse than that, I just hope it can be made short enough that the brain is <br>
not vaporized.  Anyway it's just a thought.<br>
