Thanks all, for your patience with me, unscientist that I obviously am...<br>
Thanks everyone for all the learning and knowledge that abounds here! i am<br>
enriched by your many many words,  as most of you know I appreciate the<br>
upgrade i recieved.<br>
<p>
Like Davin, I am off for awhile (this time for real) and on to learn a bit<br>
more about  some technostuff... ( mayeb I will even learn to type, somehow.)<br>
....this takes up too much time, even though i learn SOOOOOo much from all of<br>
you. <br>
<p>
Visual Art beckons... and it takes work, lots of it.<br>
<p>
Enjoy!!!! <br>
...don't peck too hard at each other, there's some really *lovely* people<br>
under all the hard silicon(e?) armours you sometimes wear.<br>
Love, <br>
Nadi <br>
