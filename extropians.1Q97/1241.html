Evil flying monkeys influenced the ordinarily-wondrous QueeneMuse to write:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
Because, for one, the words politically correct, at first, were not a jab, a<br>
joke or a poke at people who are trying to whine about their condition, or<br>
get their way, but meant some one who had first done their homework and tried<br>
to make an educated political decision. Which then became a kind of position,<br>
and instead of being thinking, became unthinking.<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
"at first?"<br>
<p>
(*cough*) "Was you _dere_, Fritz?"<br>
<p>
Well, historically, "politically-correct" was, as best I can recall, <br>
a phrase used by Marxist(-Leninist?)(-Maoist?) theory hacks to <br>
dissect or deconstruct utterances (you name it, movies, PhD theses, <br>
*any*damnthing) of which they disapproved. And there were real <br>
consequences if you didn't measure up...<br>
<p>
To have published something not-politically-correct was to have put <br>
oneself at risk of demotion, being passed-over, reeducation (in the <br>
paddies or gulags) or adjudication as (politically-)insane. Sometimes <br>
one simply disappeared and/or was written out of the encyclopedia just <br>
like the Tu-144.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry, but long before the phrase was sanitized by lefties, the <br>
phrase had a lot of the same weight as "pure Aryan stock", and yet I <br>
don't see any Nuremberg trial being scheduled for the guilty still <br>
living.<br>
<p>
*cough*, again.<br>
<p>
Now, as to your other point: Doctrinaire *anything* is *always* a <br>
worthy candidate for inspection. Left, Right, up, down, in, out...<br>
<p>
Be well,<br>
<p>
MMB, at but not for OCC<br>
