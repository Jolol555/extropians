<i>&gt;For those looking for scientific studies on herbal medicine, I </i><br>

<i>&gt;these studies.  It might be worth looking into.</i><br>
<p>

<i>&gt;relationship between herbal and Western medicinal approaches, as </i><br>
<i>&gt;their hospitals utilize both.  According to the National Cancer </i><br>

 We often forget that many of our so called "Magic Bullets" are<br>
derived from plant sources. (Botany, the living heart of pharmacy).<br>
Two of our most recent and powerfull anti-cancer drugs, Vincristine<br>
(Madagascar periwinkle) with its dramatic effects on leukemias, and<br>
Taxol (Pacific Yew tree) are botanical in origin.<br>
<p>
 I would like to recommend to all who are interested in this<br>
discussion the books/works of Dr Andrew Weil.<br>
<p>
A Harvard trained M.D. and an ethnobotanist. Dr Weil has a current<br>
#1 bestseller (Spontaneous Healing) as well as a couple of other<br>
good books including his more comprehensive manual "Natural Health<br>
Natural Medicine.<br>
<p>
 Dr Weil calls what he is doing "Integrative Medicine" because he<br>
stresses he is trying to create a true synthesis of allopathic and<br>
alternative medicines.<br>
<p>
He is big on personnel responsibility.<br>
<p>
 He calls alternative medicine a "very mixed bag" but tries to keep<br>
an open mind as well as insisting on rigorous proof of all claims.<br>
Local PBS stations often have his video on during their "Beg-a-<br>
thons" so this is a good place to get an overall view.<br>
<p>
 I have been on a vitamin/mineral/herb regimen essentially right<br>
out of his book for a month and have never felt better.<br>
<p>
I truly feel this work is the near future of medicine.<br>
