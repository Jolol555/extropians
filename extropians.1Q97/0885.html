&lt;&lt; you are free<br>
 to feel insulted by my beliefs if you like, none was intended. <br>
<p>
Of COURSE i free to feel insulted, silly boy! I am free to feel anything I<br>
want!<br>
<p>
 I don't<br>
 know anything about you personally. <br>
<p>
Well, if you  did you would not have called me new age, and you would have<br>
CERTAINLy known that that would insult the hell out of me. I hate mysitc, new<br>
age stuff!<br>
In fact, in an Extropian forum, I think almost everyone would recognize "new<br>
age, mystical" as a put down, if not they are in the wrong room.<br>
<p>
 Perhaps, I know you well enough now by your posts to know some buttons I<br>
could push that may insult you, but it would be counter productive to do it.<br>
Plus you have already asserted that you are incapable of being angered by<br>
words, so perhaps you are immune to jabs of that nature.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;I believe that words have meaning.&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Here is that conundrum again, what do you mean by words have meaning? That<br>
they have an effect on people? What can they do, if they don't cause thoughts<br>
which give rise to emotions which then give rise to actions.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;To what specific referent do the words "balance of thoughfulness and</i><br>
 detachment" refer? <br>
<p>
This is what I meant:<br>
<p>
If we can look at a specific emotion ( let's use the asshole example):<br>
<p>
.... if a homeless guy runs up to my face at fifty miles an hour and yells<br>
"ASSHOLE!!!!" - spits on the ground and runs off...<br>
I will certainly, at first, feel angry, upset, perhaps threatened and maybe<br>
even cry.<br>
<p>
Then, with the proper detachment, in a few seconds I will become thoughtful<br>
again, I will realize that this is not someone who i care about , and worse,<br>
he is crazy as a loon, and I will rationally decide that my anger was a<br>
flight or fight response, and calm down, shaking my head and releasing large<br>
amounts of adreniline back to where they can be processed into my system.... <br>
Now if my dearest friend says it, I will have a totally diffrent RATIONAL<br>
response.<br>
But the emotions may be largely the same, intitally.<br>
I will also perhaps get a surge of adreniline, maybe even cry, but I will<br>
thoughtfully balance my actions with the response, maybe see if I have done<br>
anything really assholey, then if not, I will confront him, chosing what<br>
emotion is appropriate.  <br>
<p>
If in the case that I was an ass, perhaps I did something that needs an<br>
amends, or some action i can take, if not,  maybe I need to change something<br>
about the reltionship or drop the friend, either way I have decided upon an<br>
emotional/rational course, based on how much VALUE this person has in my<br>
life, what the situation is and how it will benefit the relationship and<br>
myself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Upon what scale, by what unit of measure, am I to</i><br>
 seek this "balance"?  <br>
<p>
I have no idea, it is your choice. I balance it by how much productivity and<br>
pleasure I get out of situations. And how efficacious I am as an individual.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;What do you mean by "allow for" emotions?  Do you<br>
 mean to recognize that they exist? &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
No, they do not need your recogition in order to exist.<br>
<p>
No, simply,  I mean FEEL them, allow the emotion that is appropriate, then do<br>
the_work_( and it can take work) to control them, instead of repressing them<br>
or denying they exist. This is different than compulsively acting (reacting)<br>
on them or expressing them,. BTW.<br>
