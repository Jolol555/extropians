        That is exactly it.  Politics ultimately affect life in some way or<br>
another.  Many would argue that life itself is a politic.  People must know<br>
where they stand in life --know what limits and freedoms they accurately<br>
possess.  In application to libertarianism, those who are at least in accord<br>
with the politic have no desire for limitations in life.<br>
They (and I am one of them) want to be under a thumb as little as possible,<br>
and in effect, are confident that libertarianism is the way to<br>
achieve this.  Show me a politic that will attain freedom in a better way,<br>
and I will strongly consider changing politics.<br>
<p>
        On a more personal level, I am planning on moving to California<br>
before the end of the year; the reasons vary, though I guarantee that<br>
politics have a lot of bearing on my plans.  I am willing to attain my<br>
freedoms...and this includes moving to where the potential of opportunity<br>
is vastening.  I am confident of my political opinions because I am<br>
confident in myself --the broadest horizons are within oneself, and though<br>
the stakes are high, it boils down to another question of faith or<br>
freedom...and I'll take the latter, thanks.<br>
