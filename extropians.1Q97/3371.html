<p>
HIV was renamed from HTLV-III.  But the paper you cited, that Gallo published<br>
in 1983, claimed that ANOTHER virus, HTLV-I, caused AIDS.  It was not<br>
until a year later, in 1984, that Gallo published his arguments that HTLV-III <br>
causes AIDS.  So when you said Gallo's paper arguing that the virus later<br>
renamed HIV "... was published in 1983 not 1984", you are wrong. Do you<br>
follow that?<br>
