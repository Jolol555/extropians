<i>&gt; This is not a superstitious list, I suspect you knew that ; I agree on</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; surface this statement sounds a bit ambiguous.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you took these words as mystic I did not. Example:  body builder eats</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt; exercises from her/his mind... his "spirit" is his will, (disciplined or</i><br>
not)<br>
<i>&gt; and (s)he finds him/herself as changed... through manifestaion of</i><br>
intent....<br>
<i>&gt; Our body is the easiest to automorph, in fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our posture, our facial expressions, vocal tones, movement , grace and</i><br>
poise<br>
<i>&gt; all reflect our self esteem, our inner self...</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact, if we have money, we can freely exchange our features for ones</i><br>
that<br>
<i>&gt; suit us better...</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is controlled by our mind...  made concrete by our will....</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with Lyle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ON WITH THE AUTOMORPH!</i><br>
<p>
Hmm....well I misunderstood his statement then.  I apologize for the<br>
misunderstanding.  I really had not followed the thread too closely,<br>
although I disagree a tad with Lyle's first assertion in the beginning of<br>
this thread.  Oh well, I guess it does not matter much becaise I must be<br>
leaving this list anyhow.  Goodbye.<br>
