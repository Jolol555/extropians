<i>&gt; My parents saw I was getting mail from Lucifer.com </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and now they think I'm in league with the devil!</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; They are threatening to cut off the computer (this computer)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from the internet because they think it is Satanic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been raised to be dependant upon them </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and would have a difficult time claiming my independance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been denied access to and control of my assets.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been threatened with homelessness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I fear for my health and safety.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am sovereign and have declared that publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; My life is a mess.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is.  A natural consequence of the fact that you are evading<br>
a plain reality that independence is an irreducible prerequisite of<br>
sovereignty.  You want the goodies--room, board, net access--but you<br>
won't accept the conditions they put on them.  You're not acting<br>
like a sovereign, you're acting like a child.<br>
<p>
If you want legal help for genuine threats from your parents, all<br>
you have to do is accept the conditions of that help--acceptance of<br>
the American legal system.  If you want to force your parents to<br>
recognize you as an emancipated minor, you have to convince a judge<br>
(an official of /their/ sovereign) to sign the order.  If you want<br>
help from other sovereigns, tell us what you have to offer for it.<br>
Will you clean my house in exchange for room and board?  Will you do<br>
backups on my computer in exchange for net access?  TANSTAAFL!<br>
