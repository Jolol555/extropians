<i>&gt; Subject: Help with "proof" for non-existence of God</i><br>
<i>&gt; Date: Tuesday, March 11, 1997 1:13 AM</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suppose God was made up of an infinite number of the old Z80 computer</i><br>
chips  <br>
<p>
I still use one of those on a regular basis.  Of course, it's in my<br>
calculator, but hey, that's where I do my best programming anyway.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and, of course, a operating system so they could work together. You could</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; assign 10 chips to analyze and predict what one chip could do, if that</i><br>
didn't <br>
<i>&gt; do the job make it a thousand chips or a million, if that still wasn't</i><br>
enough <br>
<i>&gt; assign an infinite number of chips, remember the definition of an</i><br>
infinite<br>
<i>&gt; set is that you can make a one to one correspondence with a proper subset</i><br>
of <br>
<i>&gt; it. Strange things happen in the arithmetic of infinities, each chip</i><br>
without <br>
<i>&gt; exception could have an infinite number of chips packing an infinite</i><br>
amount <br>
<i>&gt; of computing power making predictions about what that one finite chip</i><br>
would <br>
<i>&gt; do, and you would still have an infinite number of chips to do other</i><br>
things, <br>
<i>&gt; like figuring out what would happen next in the universe.</i><br>
<p>
If this was the case then, as you said, God would have no free will.  The<br>
universe in general has no free will either.  Therefore, God and the<br>
universe would be synomous.  Besides, if I could convince a theist that God<br>
had no free will, that would probably be close enough to make the jump to<br>
non existence.  <br>
<p>
Of course, if the universe is infinite than it would be possible to have<br>
multiple omnipotent and omniscent beings.  Then they could fight it out. <br>
Wait a second...  8)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think a better strategy is to ask the theists if God is omnipotent, if</i><br>
they  <br>
<i>&gt; say yes ask them if he can make a rock so heavy he can't lift it. Then</i><br>
ask <br>
<i>&gt; them if good and evil are independent of God. If they say yes then God</i><br>
has <br>
<i>&gt; nothing to with morality, except He is supposed to act that way, just</i><br>
like<br>
<i>&gt; everybody else. If they say no then the statement "God is good" is a</i><br>
vacuous <br>
<i>&gt; tautology.                                       </i><br>
<p>
I'm not exactly sure where the connection between these two things are.  I<br>
have tried the rock one and mostly I just get people to roll there eyes. <br>
They have encountered that one enough so that it loses meaning.<br>
