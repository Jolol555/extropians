"(Dr. Chandra) had long since broken off communications with the<br>
dwindling body of philosophers who argued that computers could not<br>

 ["If you can prove to me that *you're* not pretending to be annoyed,"<br>
he had once retorted scornfully to one such critic,"I'll take you<br>
seriously." At that point, his opponent had put on a most convincing<br>
imitation of anger.]" -- Arthur C. Clarke, _2010_<br>
