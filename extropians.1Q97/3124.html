<i>&gt;1. Unlike conventional infectious diseases, including venereal diseases,</i><br>
<i>&gt;American/European AIDS is nonrandomly (90%) restricted to males, although no</i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS disease is male specific.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. HIV is said to cause AIDS only after a peculiar latent period.  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt;no precedent for an infectious agent that causes primary diseases on average</i><br>
<i>&gt;only 10 years after transfusion in adults and only after 2 years in</i><br>
<i>&gt;children.  The diversity of these latent periods is inconsistent with one</i><br>
<i>&gt;infectious agent and their magnitude is characteristic for diseases caused</i><br>
<i>&gt;by chronic exposure to toxic substances.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. There is no common, predictable pattern of AIDS symptoms in patients of</i><br>
<i>&gt;different risk groups.  Instead, different risk groups have their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;characteristic AIDS diseases.</i><br>

<i>&gt;I've spent some time teaching about AIDS, and I agree that Gallo is not to</i><br>
be trusted and there are some things that don't fit about the whole HIV=AIDs<br>
hypothesis.  But Duesberg can't be trusted either (I've met the man, he's<br>
into publicity for it's own sake).  A lot of the confusion that comes in is<br>
about what HIV does or doesn't do.  The list above contains some inaccuracies--<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1)  AIDs is not at all male specific.  The over abundance of male cases in</i><br>
the U.S. is entirely due to its route of entry onto American soil via a<br>
homosexual community that was incredibly promiscuous.  New cases of HIV<br>
infection not attributable to needles show a female dominant pattern with<br>
African American teenaged girls most at risk.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2)  There is something strange about the latency period.  It keeps</i><br>
increasing. At the present rate, it won't be odd to find HIV positive<br>
patients dying of old age before the virus gets them. Nevertheless, the vast<br>
majority of HIV positive people eventually die of opportunistic infection, a<br>
fact that needs explaining.  <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;3)  HIV, by itself, is not what kills you.  It only destroys your immune</i><br>
system.  Hence it is not odd that different risk groups should have<br>
different symptoms.  A common symptom among all risk groups is the<br>
destruction of T cells.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The AIDs infrastructure has at time been alarmist and overconfident of</i><br>
research claims.  It wants money thrown at it.  Nevertheless, one should not<br>
throw out all the HIV/AIDs research on that grounds.  <br>
