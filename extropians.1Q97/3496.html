                    THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL MEDIA<br>
<p>
                         VERSUS THE INTERNET<br>
<p>
                 60 Minutes Anti-conspiracy Slop Job<br>
<p>
<p>
      by Ian Williams Goddard <br>
<p>
      The major media have launched a disinformation war designed<br>
      to smear the Internet.  The Internet represents a heretofore <br>
      unparalleled level of informational competition for the major <br>
      media.  A primary pretext for these Internet attacks focuses <br>
      on the "conspiracy theories," or alternative news and views, <br>
      that the Net allows the public to freely access and express.<br>
<p>
      Most recently the CBS program 60 Minutes (02/1/97), using <br>
      false and misleading claims,  attacked conspiracy theories <br>
      and alternative information on the Internet such as my work.  <br>
<p>
      60 Minutes anchor Lesley Stahl, while arguing for the removal <br>
      of undesirable information such as mine from the Internet,  <br>
      promoted the hysteria-inducing fear that freedom of access  <br>
      to conspiracy theory is a threat to the minds of the children. <br>
<p>
      After showing my TWA 800 web page with my name prominently <br>
      displayed, Lesley Stahl pointed a finger at the lead graphic <br>
      I created (<a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm</a>) saying:<br>
<p>
                STAHL: Shouldn't this be expunged ? <br>
<p>
                GUEST: On what grounds?<br>
<p>
                STAHL: That it's wrong, that it's <br>
                inaccurate, it's irresponsible, that <br>
                it is spreading fear and suspicion <br>
                of the government; 10,000 reasons.<br>
<p>
                GUEST: Ooh, sedition I see. So it's <br>
                anti-government, so it spreads fear.<br>
                But who should regulate it? ... <br>
<p>
                STAHL: So you think it's better <br>
                to leave all this junk out there? <br>
<p>
      Now let's see how accurate the claims of 60 Minutes are.<br>
      My graphic, or "junk," which 60 Minutes calls "wrong" and <br>
      "inaccurate," contains one sentence making three claims:<br>
<p>
                (1) The "streak of light"<br>
                    reported to "hit the plane" <br>
<p>
                (2) "followed the course like <br>
                    the outline of a parabola" <br>
<p>
                (3) not unlike a guided missile.<br>
<p>
      (1) The New York Times (07/19/96) said that eyewitnesses<br>
      reported a "'streak of light' hitting the plane just before <br>
      it blew up."  An eyewitness I've interviewed, Roland Penney, <br>
      told Newsday (09/01/96) that "the thin white line" that raced <br>
      upwards toward TWA 800 "hit that plane." This is just a small<br>
      sample (more here: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm</a>) <br>
      of the massive body of available missile-witness accounts that <br>
      60 Minutes wants you to believe are "wrong" and "irresponsible."<br>
<p>
      (2) As quoted on my web page, The New York Times (07/19/96), <br>
      citing the evidence that "the airplane was hit by a missile <br>
      fired from a boat," reported the following: <br>
<p>
              Paul Angelides, who lives in West Hampton<br>
              Beach... saw what he described as a "red <br>
              meteor with a smoke tail" that followed <br>
              the course like the outline of "a parabola." <br>
<p>
      (3) A streak of light that shoots across the sky leaving the <br>
      smoky and curving trail cited in claim 2, is by definition <br>
      "not unlike a guided missile." The two primary possibilities <br>
      are that this streak is  (a) a meteorite or  (b) a missile. <br>
      The radical degree of curvature sighted in my graphic, which <br>
      is consistent with most accounts, eliminates (a) leaving (b); <br>
      and therefore it is indeed most like a guided missile. <br>
<p>
      That's the kind of logical analysis CBS wants to have <br>
      "expunged" from the human record because it spreads fear <br>
      about the government, and specifically about the U.S. Navy, <br>
      which the owner of CBS, Westinghouse, works for [1].<br>
<p>
      So, each and every claim I make that 60 Minutes would like <br>
      you to believe is "wrong," "inaccurate," and "irresponsible," <br>
      is IN FACT logical, true, and accurate according to over 150<br>
      eyewitness accounts cited in major media sources. Therefore, <br>
      the claims of 60 Minutes are, to the contrary, the only <br>
      claims proven to be false and inaccurate. <br>
<p>
<p>
      WHAT 60 MINUTES IS NOT TELLING YOU<br>
<p>
      While Lesley Stahl may have laughed at web pages claiming <br>
      that the major media are not telling all about TWA 800, the <br>
      fact is that the major media routinely suppress verifiable <br>
      information that should spread fear of the government. <br>
<p>
      For example, CBS has the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) <br>
      video from Waco, TX (4/19/93) that shows the FBI shooting <br>
      machine-guns into Mount Carmel, the Branch Davidian's home, <br>
      most heavily as the fire started and people tried to escape. <br>
<p>
      Not only has a top FLIR expert evaluated the video [2], <br>
      concluding that it shows gunshots toward the building, <br>
      but according to Gordon Novel (head of investigation in <br>
      the Ramsey Clark Waco lawsuit, who acquired the FLIR video<br>
      from the quickly dead former head of CIA, Bill Colby) CBS<br>
      even had the video examined by the independent laboratory  <br>
      Infraspection Institute of Berlington, VT,  which also <br>
      concluded that the video shows machine-gun fire toward <br>
      the building. 60 Minutes did its homework and was ready <br>
      to run the FLIR video with the findings.<br>
<p>
      However, Novel reports [3] that all it took was an angry <br>
      call from the Justice Department for CBS and 60 Minutes to <br>
      cave-in and opt instead to suppress the truth by not runn-<br>
      ing the FLIR program.  Because it seems CBS does not want <br>
      to spread any fear or suspicions about the government, CBS <br>
      viewers can be sure never to see the shocking FLIR video. <br>
<p>
      Contrary to Ms. Stahl's laughter at the claim, the major <br>
      media,  even her own program,  are willfully suppressing <br>
      powerful evidence against the US government and in so do-<br>
      ing are willing to sacrifice the interests of the American <br>
      people for the security of those in power with the blood <br>
      of men, women, and children all over their hands.  Then, <br>
      after covering up mass murder in Waco, 60 Minutes moves <br>
      on to smear and suppresses evidence suggesting that the  <br>
      US government killed all 230 people aboard TWA 800. The <br>
      pattern is clear: serve the State, screw the people.<br>
<p>
<p>
      MAJOR MEDIA vs THE INTERNET<br>
<p>
      While the major media work to smear the Internet as an <br>
      unreliable source of lies and rumor, the facts are that <br>
      the Internet has proven to be more reliable in terms of <br>
      getting the truth out more quickly than the major media.  <br>
<p>
      A case in point is the recent coverage the ABC program <br>
      20/20 (01/17/97) gave to the compelling evidence of fore-<br>
      knowledge by the federal government of the Oklahoma City <br>
      bombing [4]. While 20/20 called this report "an exclusive <br>
      investigation," the fact is that every detail they "scooped" <br>
      could have been found on the Internet a year beforehand.  <br>
      Indeed, ABC took the credit for the leg-work of many grass-<br>
      roots investigators, whom the major media had been smearing <br>
      previously as the "paranoid nuts" that lurk about in the <br>
      dark and fearful world of the Internet.<br>
<p>
      The chaotic dynamics of Internet-information processing <br>
      is light-years ahead of the major media, which can only<br>
      hope to keep pace with the rapidly evolving information<br>
      structures that form the electronic world of cyberspace.<br>
<p>
<p>
      DYNAMICS OF INFORMATIONAL FREEDOM <br>
<p>
      As on-line researcher Thomas Shoemaker [5] observes [6], <br>
      the process-focused nature of the Internet's informational <br>
      structure renders the Net too dynamic and fast-paced for <br>
      the outdated product-oriented media behemoths, which the <br>
      Internet threatens to cut down to size:<br>
<p>
              The media of which Lesley Stahl belongs <br>
              to is failing. They achieved dominance <br>
              years ago, when there was less competition <br>
              from other information systems: their main <br>
              worry was about what other members of their <br>
              monopoly were doing. Now they are in decline <br>
              and denial. They have and continue to view <br>
              the "news" as a "product" which is massaged, <br>
              molded, dressed up, packaged, promoted, and <br>
              then delivered to the consumer as a finished <br>
              commodity.<br>
<p>
              The internet is perceived as a threat by <br>
              Lesley, her co-workers and their bosses, <br>
              because it is not product-focused,  but <br>
              process-focused. They cannot successfully <br>
              cope with the creative, turbulent decentral-<br>
              ization of the internet...it is just too <br>
              free for them. Their idea of news is an <br>
              address to the peasants (us) from the <br>
              royal family (the media, of course).<br>
<p>
      The process nature of Internet informational-structure allows <br>
      a story to unfold spontaneously in such a way that the whole <br>
      decentralized society is free to become active participants <br>
      in a public investigation and analysis of available facts, <br>
      free to make the input that Lesley Stahl wants "expunged" <br>
      from the human record.  <br>
<p>
      But even as their Internet smear campaign, frequently focusing <br>
      on TWA 800, may signal a fear in CBS of the chaotic and spon-<br>
      taneous nature of informational freedom, CBS may smear those <br>
      proposing that TWA 800 was hit with a U.S. Navy missile simply<br>
      because CBS is owned by the large military-industrial-complex <br>
      contractor, Westinghouse, which works for the U.S. Navy [1].<br>
<p>
<p>
      ON THE INTERNET, GOOD INFORMATION DRIVES OUT BAD<br>
<p>
      The fear that bad information threatens the good on the <br>
      Internet fails to observe that over time and with the input <br>
      of thousands of minds, we have a greater ability than ever <br>
      to see all sides of the story. The instant input of so many <br>
      people who know parts or all of a give topic allows the <br>
      Internet as a whole to more quickly drive out bad informa-<br>
      tion than the major media where few are permitted input. <br>
<p>
      When I write an essay and post it to the Internet, instantly <br>
      people with other ideas or expertise in an area I cover can <br>
      critique it for all to evaluate.  While many replies offer<br>
      only empty insults expressing rage rather than constructive <br>
      analysis, on the whole, this system of automatic feedback <br>
      and input accelerates the process of "social learning."<br>
<p>
      The major media of all varieties make their case in forums <br>
      that are insulated from the instantaneous and equally visible <br>
      input and critique of others.  It's exactly as Tom Shoemaker <br>
      observed previously, that the major media wants to address <br>
      the public like the royal family addresses its sea of <br>
      peasants, where rebuttal is discouraged and denied. <br>
<p>
      To a larger degree than at any time in human history, the <br>
      Internet puts us all on the same level; the Internet is a <br>
      great equalizer.  Let us honor this gift to humanity, not <br>
      disparage it as those who still live in the old ways seek <br>
      to disparage the new and empowering media that is the Internet.<br>
<p>
