Here's an excerpt from a message I sent to my father (who lives in <br>
Switzerland).  We are working on a science fiction book together, and right <br>
now, we are basically brainstorming and discussing what we want to do with the <br>
book.  We are planning to have a very powerful artificially intelligent being <br>
in the book, and we were discussing whether it would be creative, or would <br>
depend on humans to come up with ideas for it.  He said it would be totally <br>
rational and non-creative, and I said that if it was so rational and had so <br>
much knowledge, surely it would know about all the ways that have been <br>
developed to make a computer creative (such as genetic algorithms), and would <br>
use those methods and be creative itself.  He countered that evolution and <br>
genetic algorithms were not really creative since they were only fiddling <br>
around with what was already *there*.  He takes a sort of mystical slant on <br>
things (although he is quite rational and highly intelligent; he's just had <br>
some very strange experiences), so he is viewing creativity as something <br>
beyond the physical world.   My response follows:<br>
<p>
<p>
My belief is that creativity is a physical process, and that our creative mind <br>
is similar in many respects to our thinking mind.  I also believe that the <br>
processes of creativity (and also of consciousness), being physical processes, <br>
can be carried out on a machine which humans build.<br>
<p>
I believe creativity is inherent in the processes of variation and selection.  <br>
The variation is where newness comes in, and the selection is where only the <br>
"good" patterns are retained.  I believe a sort of variation and selection <br>
happens in our minds during all of our thought processes, and I believe that <br>
the state of mind that we call "creative" is one in which more radical <br>
variation is happening.<br>
<p>
You said that just fiddling around with what's already there is not creative, <br>
but is more like what intellectual thinking is.  Creativity, according to you, <br>
is when something entirely *new* is created.  When I consider the various <br>
creative ideas that people have come up with, and when I consider my <br>
experiences with creativity, I realize that what was created was very related <br>
to what had been worked on before.  In other words, nothing *completely* new <br>
was created; in every case of creativity I am aware of, the creation was <br>
basically a rearrangement or revision of old ideas.  Do you have any examples <br>
where someone suddenly started getting creative ideas that were completely <br>
unrelated to things they had thought of or experienced previously?  Even if <br>
there *are* /some/ examples, nearly all examples of human creativity are <br>
basically modifications of already held ideas.  Even the most creative of us <br>
aren't all *that* original.  We're all borrowing each other's ideas and our <br>
own old ideas.<br>
<p>
Of course, when one is *experiencing* the creative state, one is basically <br>
open to anything, and the creative ideas just seem to come pouring in.  During <br>
the experience, there is no awareness that these ideas are simply <br>
modifications of ideas one already had.  The new ideas seem so fresh and <br>
creative, but if they are analyzed later, one can see how various past <br>
experiences and thinking helped shape the mind to be open to the creative <br>
idea, and how nearly all of the elements in the idea are ones that one already <br>
had in one's mind, and very little of the idea is actually *new*, except for <br>
the particular *arrangement* of the elements of the idea.<br>
<p>
So, it is certainly good advice to tell someone to relax their mind and <br>
suspend thinking and critical judgement when they wish to enter a creative <br>
state.  This allows more radical ideas than usual to form before they are <br>
dismissed by critical judgement too early.  It's a state that allows much <br>
greater *variation* of thought than usual.  The normal thinking state allows <br>
some variation, just not as much as the creative state, and I believe that is <br>
the only real difference between the two states.  To the person experiencing <br>
these different states, they can seem quite different, but to a cognitive <br>
scientist, I believe they would appear to be *basically* the same thing, with <br>
one state simply allowing for more variation and less critical selection than <br>
the other.<br>
<p>
This type of behaviour is often programmed into computer software which use <br>
genetic algorithms to find optimal solutions to problems.  If the computer <br>
doesn't vary the parameters enough, it runs the risk of finding a solution <br>
which is as good as it can find by making only small variations.  Imagine a <br>
bumpy landscape, with bumps of all sizes.  The computer's job is to find the <br>
highest peak of the highest bump, or at least on a bump *close* in height to <br>
the highest.  If the computer is on a fairly small bump, and it keeps making <br>
small steps up the bump, it will get to the top of that bump and stop, <br>
thinking it had found the best solution.  But if it makes large enough <br>
variations, it will often end up on completely different bumps, which it can <br>
explore with small steps, to find the top.  If it does enough of these big <br>
jumps, followed by little steps, it will likely find the optimal solution, the <br>
highest peak of the highest bump, or at least something close enough to the <br>
best not to matter too much.<br>
<p>
The variations going on in the computer software is a process of creativity, <br>
and the selection going on, of the best solutions, makes it rational <br>
creativity.  Creativity that works.  <br>
<p>
Of course, as you say, someone has to tell the computer what problem to work <br>
on, and once they describe the problem sufficiently to the computer and give <br>
it all the criteria for what type of solution they are looking for, the <br>
computer will be off and searching for a creative solution to that problem.  <br>
Things are done this way because we haven't built computers yet which have <br>
their own sets of goals and create their own problems to solve.  I see no <br>
reason, though, why it is not *possible* for a computer to be made which can <br>
pursue its own goals and make up its own problems to solve.  If there was a <br>
computer doing this, would you say that it was not really creative?  If so, <br>
why is it creative when humans come up with their own goals and pursue them, <br>
finding ingenious solutions to their problems?<br>
<p>
You ask for one creative idea a computer has come up with.  I don't know all <br>
the details of this particular example, but essentially, there was some sort <br>
of game that people played on the computer, a kind of space game with trading <br>
going on and battles between groups and so forth.  The computer was given the <br>
rules of the game and so forth, and played by itself for a while, tyring out <br>
all kinds of different strategies, evolving them as it went, and eventually it <br>
developed a very elegant and clever strategy that blew away every human <br>
player; it was unbeatable.<br>
<p>
Well, of course, *that's* not creative!  We understand exactly *how* the <br>
computer went about finding that strategy.  It was completely rational and <br>
logical, so it must not be creative.  If we understand it, then it must not be <br>
creative!  Creativity is *beyond* understanding!<br>
<p>
I don't really think so.  I think we *can* understand creativity, and I think <br>
we can program software that is creative once we do understand it.  I don't <br>
think it's as mysterious as some *want* it to be.<br>
