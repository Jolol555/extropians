Transhumanists in socialist democracies, like you in your system, work<br>
within the system they have. Jim has the same goals most of us have<br>
regarding the autoevolution of humanity, yet his route to accomplish these<br>
is projected on his political system. What he doesn't see or maybe doesn't<br>
accept, is that his system is changing towards yours, and yours a little<br>
towards his. In the time i was in college my ideas were pretty much the<br>
same as his, when i stepped into the REAL world they changed pretty fast.<br>
Humans are practical and rational, and many will adapt to a situation and<br>
proceed to pursue their goals, in a way that will bring result efficiently,<br>
those that don't, won't see much of their goals realized. Like you found<br>
efficient ways to do it in yours, we find efficient ways to do it in ours,<br>
our logic shaped by that of the system we have to work with.<br>
<p>
Please note that this not only goes for people in social democracies who<br>
refuse to adapt to change to a more free market system, but for people in<br>
the states as well, who refuse to adapt to new political and social trends.<br>
Times are changing, a little of the old, a little of the other, plus a new<br>
element ? <br>
<p>
Any political systems influence is just what the individual makes of it,<br>
opportunities, inventiveness and resourcefullness, are trades that benefit<br>
individuals in ANY political system, allthough i agree in some more than in<br>
others, they are NOT inherent to capitalism exclusively. Whereas these<br>
individual characteristics mean little in a politically/socially stable<br>
society (!), they tend to flourish in one that is subject to rapid<br>
change... ;-) <br>
<p>
Personally i'd go with any political system that allows the best<br>
possibilities for the realization of transhumanist goals, A system that<br>
works, works. Fact is the American capitalist system works best at this<br>
point in our status of development (for most people that is, but again<br>
that's what a democracy is about isn't it ?), but that doesn't mean we can<br>
sit back and relax, until it doesn't work anymore. More efficient ways can<br>
be found, and it would be pretty foolish not to even CONSIDER things that<br>
worked in any other form of political system, because we worship our own<br>
form like a 'sacred cow' (btw, this also goes for you Jim), or because we<br>
even FEAR one particular other form, of which the signals have been very<br>
obvious to identify on this list recently. Very rational and open minded of<br>
you my fellow transhumans. :(<br>
<p>
Socialist influence on society is losing ground everywhere in the world<br>
except in the US, and the increase of it in your country is only logical,<br>
as it no longer needs to set an example against an ennemy powers ideology.<br>
So logical and predictable. The Roman empire fell, the English empire<br>
couldn't hold, and the communists suffered the same fate. I had really<br>
hoped the open mindedness of the scope of time all of you discuss space<br>
exploration and the future in general in, would have reflected a little bit<br>
more on your political/social and historical perspectives. But instead you<br>
all seem to assume a capitalist democracy in its current form (The United<br>
States of Earth ?) ruling the universe for eons to come i guess. <br>
<p>
Has the thousand year empire finally arrived while the rest of the world<br>
was sleeping ? <br>
<p>
Sweet dreams my friends, for as long as they last...  <br>
