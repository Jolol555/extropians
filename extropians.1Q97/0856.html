There is nothing wrong with having women in combat roles.  Some women are<br>
pretty good at it.  When I was in the Army, we did exercises with a couple<br>
foreign combat units (infantry and light engineers) that included women.<br>
These units operated quite well in the mixed gender environment and the<br>
women generally pulled their own weight.<br>
<p>
*However*, there were some fundamental differences between the way the US<br>
military operates and the way these foreign units operated.  The biggest<br>
difference was that the foreign units did not differentiate between the<br>
sexes at all.  There was one set of standards for everyone with *very few*<br>
exceptions (women were allowed to have longer hair, to name one).  The women<br>
and men in the units did *everything* together:  they ate together, shared<br>
the same quarters, shared the same bathroom, shared the same showers, shared<br>
the same physical training requirements, etc.  <br>
Everyone respected everyone else, and they all seemed to get along fine.<br>
What many people would find appalling (and took us a bit to get used to, I<br>
must admit), was that the men would get undressed in front of the women and<br>
vice versa and they shared the same showers at the same time.  Contrary to<br>
popular conjecture, there weren't any overt sexual issues raised by this<br>
scenario.  This environment wasn't hard to get used to for most of us,<br>
although a couple people in our unit had problems.  You will not find this<br>
environment in the US military.<br>
<p>
This said, I would *not* recommend this for the US military any time soon.<br>
The reason is that women in the US Army are very different than the women we<br>
worked with in these foreign units.  US Army women are subject to much lower<br>
standards in many areas, and they often don't pull their own weight.  I<br>
would go on a combat mission with one of the above foreign military units<br>
that had women, but I would definitely *not* do the same with our own<br>
military women.  Most of the women I met in the US military would refuse to<br>
operate in an environment like these foreign units anyway.<br>
<p>
As sad and cliche as it sounds, the women in the foreign units would<br>
volunteer to carry the heavy squad weapons for a 2-hour patrol, but US Army<br>
women would sit back at base camp and worry about breaking a nail.  Pretty<br>
pathetic.  Must be differences in training or something.<br>
<p>
BTW, even though the women in the foreign units were well-qualified and met<br>
the standards for combat operations, they generally had a much more<br>
difficult time meeting combat standards than men, and on average men usually<br>
seemed to outperform the women at many combat related skills.  These<br>
differences were usually physiological problems (e.g. not as strong on<br>
average), and men also usually have a better "tactical sense" (hard to<br>
quantify this one) than women.<br>
