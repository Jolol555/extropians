=09This is rather old news, but there is a new article about it in<br>
this weeks Science News.  The following article is from the Intel web<br>
site, I was unable to get the Science News article, so you will have to<br>
read the hardcopy.<br>

One Trillion-Operations-Per-Second!<br>
<p>
Sandia National Labs/Intel System First to Shatter Computing<br>
High-Performance Mark<br>
<p>
SANTA CLARA, Calif., -- December 17, 1996 =96 The             [Image]<br>
United States Department of Energy's Sandia<br>
National Laboratory and Intel Corporation, the            Paul Work, a<br>
world's largest computer chip company, have built a Computational Scientist<br>
parallel supercomputer that has reached the one        at Intel, inspects<br>

using the industry standard Linpack measurement       used to shatter the<br>
method, the two organizations announced today. The  world's computing speed<br>

the previous performance record of 368.2 gigaflops   resolution photo file.<br>
(billion-operations-per-second) by over 250<br>
percent.<br>
<p>
"Today's accomplishment is computing's equivalent to breaking the sound<br>
barrier," said Dr. Craig R. Barrett, Intel executive vice president and<br>
chief operating officer. "Just a few years ago, a teraflop was an<br>
intellectual barrier that nature dared us to cross. Now that we=92ve surpas=<br>
sed<br>
that barrier, we have the computing horsepower needed to address the Grand<br>
Challenges of Science. We could be at the threshold of robust scientific<br>
discovery, triggered by access to teraflop-level computing performance."<br>

                                      perform at sustained rates of 1.4<br>
teraflops and peak rates of approaching two teraflops. Just 25 years ago,<br>
Intel introduced the world=92s first microprocessor, which delivered 60,000<br>
instructions per second.<br>
<p>
U.S. Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O=92Leary said, "This achievement firmly<br>
re-establishes U.S. computer industry leadership in developing high-end<br>
systems. Four years ago the U.S. government, industry and academia set a<br>
goal. At that time it was not clear how or even if a<br>
trillion-operations-per-second computer could be achieved. Now thanks to<br>
U.S. innovation, it=92s not only possible, it=92s being done."<br>
<p>
"The Intel/Sandia teraflop computer is built from commercial, off-the-shelf<br>
products and technologies including the same Pentium Pro processor in many<br>
of today=92s workstations and servers," said Ed Masi, general manager and v=<br>
ice<br>
president of Intel=92s Server Systems Products Division. "Using commerciall=<br>
y<br>
available technology has enabled the government to utilize the R&amp;D muscle o=<br>
f<br>
the marketplace, focusing tax dollars on combining these standard building<br>
blocks into the world=92s most powerful computer."<br>
<p>
The Linpack measurement method is the most widely recognized single<br>
benchmark for measuring sustained floating-point performance of high-end<br>
computers. It gives an accurate picture of the performance of a given<br>
computer on applications that require the solution of large, dense linear<br>
systems =96 a category that includes a very wide range of technical<br>
applications.<br>

Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading manufacturer of<br>
personal computer, networking, and communications products. Through<br>
innovative technologies, Intel is committed to improving the Internet<br>
experience for PC consumers. Additional information is available at<br>
