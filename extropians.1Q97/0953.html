<i>&gt; I believe that we may be talking about different types of offense here.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; My concern centers around power dynamics and the ways in which </i><br>
<i>&gt; persons are belittled and controlled through intimidation and verbal </i><br>
<i>&gt; bashing.  Language as a primary mechanism of social control.</i><br>
<p>
Language /can/ be used to manipulate instead of to learn.  But from<br>
that fact to deduce that the appropriate response is to ban manipulative<br>
speech is the same old fallacy that gave us prohibition and gun control.<br>
The remedy to that problem is to make ourselves less susceptible to<br>
being manipulated.  Empowerment, not repression.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your statement regarding generalizations is telling.  Most minorities </i><br>
<i>&gt; do NOT consider generalizations to be 'just' generalizations, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; most conflict theorists consider them to be legitimate causes of anger.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; After all, these generalizations were used to hold people back all these </i><br>
<i>&gt; years, and minorities are sick of hearing them.  They certainly have </i><br>
<i>&gt; no place in advanced intelligent discussion.  As I write this, I </i><br>
<i>&gt; wonder why this isn't a completely obvious point to persons like us...</i><br>
<p>
Because it's wrong.  Generalizations /are/ appropriate tools of reason.<br>
When I say "generalization", you hear "stereotype", which is a specific<br>
class of generalization that has additional features: it is usually false,<br>
it serves to denegrate a group or to justify mistreatment of them, and<br>
they are usually held dogmatically rather than rationally.  They should<br>
be fought because they are irrational.  "Blacks are mentally inferior"<br>
is a hateful thing not because it is a generalization, but because it<br>
is clearly at odds with the observed facts, and was used to justify<br>
policies that were plainly unjust and harmful.  "Whites are athletically<br>
inferior" is just a generalization.  It is not offered to justify not<br>
inviting whites to a team tryout, or to justify laws against them, or<br>
to personally denegrate whites; it's just an observation from the plain<br>
facts like membership of the NFL and NBA, and is a proper tool to use<br>
for investigating what might cause this effect.  Is it because many <br>
blacks in the US are descendents of the hardy survivors of the slave<br>
trade?  Is it because black culture encourages athletics more in young<br>
children?  Can we look at the exceptions to the rule (say, the Boston<br>
Celtics) and find any parallels or differences that are suggestive?<br>
<p>
The proper weapon to attack hateful speech is not supression, but<br>
rational argument.<br>
