This research funding point is exactly the problem. The only practical<br>
solution around the gaping hole caused by the mind-control, cult-like,<br>
permission system called economics is to realize it has outlived any<br>
usefulness. Personally, I think cryonics is a status preserving cop-out and<br>
at best can only supply some frozen post-legal clients for clandestine<br>
navigation into cold-booting a dissociated personality (pun intended). <br>
<p>
In other words, "Uploaders should do it while still warm" AND with full<br>
community support. Thus, a political stand surely has to come before<br>
full-scale, open and sanctioned research. When the political will is there<br>
for uploading I'm sure the first brain could be connected to the internet,<br>
at least, before the next qualified volunteer died. Nanotechnology won't<br>
free us from money, intrinsic value systems will do it and be in place in<br>
expectation thereof.<br>
<p>
For example, when powerful enough we'll kick-down the media with education<br>
first, then by randomly declaring 'free days' where no explicit money can<br>
be used, but all regular exchanges are free, implicitly recorded and<br>
enforceable for anyone with an understanding of 'nano', which should be<br>
about everyone on the net (including unlocking your prisoner's doors,<br>
assuming they have a permanent web recording). We'll then polynomially<br>
increase the number of these 'anarchy' days annually until there is but one<br>
day per year when explicit money can be used, a sort of remembrance day,<br>
though I doubt there would be little support for it. The alternative<br>
massive changeover to an uneducated world of excesses once the 'anything<br>
boxes' are freed will be catastrophic and we'll probably have to start<br>
throwing rocks from the moon just to survive. <br>
<p>
Again, I repeat: Funding, and money in general, has to be seen for what it<br>
really is, which is a mind-control, cult-like permission system de-coupled<br>
from any usefulness. Money, like a sail on a pioneer ship, helps cross an<br>
ocean, but when you're ship-wrecked in sight of land you don't bother<br>
trimming the sails. You swim like crazy.<br>
<p>
If I die through society's willful neglect of this issue, wouldn't that be<br>
a crime?<br>
<p>
<p>
Best,<br>
