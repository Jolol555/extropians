<p>
Like the ancient greeks did in Athens ?<br>
<p>
A few suggestions:<br>
<p>
Being able to 'rule'<br>
<p>
For such a (minimal) state to function, one needs a minimal (state)<br>
educational system, teaching basic law, next to the most basic skills<br>
needed to function in society. So everybody knows how to 'rule' instead of<br>
just knowing how to be 'ruled'. I suggest a (one day a week or so)<br>
educational system that runs alongside to the various private education<br>
systems.  <br>
<p>
corruption<br>
<p>
In a smaller state the possibilities for corruption will already be far<br>
less, as well as the 'campaign contributions' you pointed out will be<br>
eleiminated. But still to ensure a corrupt free political system, maybe<br>
supervisors could be randomly assigned to check the representatives,<br>
swicthing between them on a regular basis.  <br>
<p>
funding<br>
<p>
Why not fund the political system on a capitalist basis ?. That is;<br>
offering them a percentage of the benefits to society they bring, instead<br>
of having the taxpayer pay their year income. The 'state' as a whole could<br>
be rewarded by society a percentage of the increase of the economy,<br>
basically paying them if they do well, and not paying them if they fail.<br>
Political representative could become a lucrative (and popular!) job this<br>
way... Ofcourse in an economically bad situation, many will refuse their<br>
political right, and logically in such situations, their jobs will be<br>
filled by relatively more people, who don't have to worry about losing a<br>
years income, (by the process of random 'election' and refusal), &amp; economy<br>
could restore itself that way, as these people would have (generally<br>
speaking) a better economical insight. (to whatever extent that would still<br>
be needed in a minimized state...) <br>
<p>
I'm all for it, as there's one other thing you forgot in your criticism of<br>
democracy not being a correct representation of society: Know any<br>
congressmen of 18 or 21 years old ?<br>
