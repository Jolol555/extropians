<p>
&lt;bold&gt;CATALOGUE VERSION CHOICES&lt;/bold&gt;:<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;1.&lt;/bold&gt;  This version can be read by everyone, no matter what<br>
type of <br>
<p>
     computer you use, or what type of software you use.  It is a<br>
simple<br>
<p>
     format, with just &lt;bold&gt;our entire catalogue pasted into the body<br>
of a <br>
<p>
    single email message, 316K in size.&lt;/bold&gt;  If you use pine or elm<br>
on a unix <br>
<p>
     system or an advanced software version such as Eudora Pro 3.0 or<br>
<p>
     later, you will most likely receive it as a single email message. <br>
 <br>
<p>
     However, if your software limits incoming email messages to a     <br>
<p>
<p>
     certain size, say 32K or so, then your software will split it into<br>
<p>
<p>
     multiple email message parts.   Whether you receive it as a single<br>
<p>
<p>
     email message or multiple part email messages, you can easily <br>
<p>
     paste it into one whole text document with your word processor, in<br>
<p>
<p>
     about 10 minutes or so.<br>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;2.&lt;/bold&gt;  For more advanced computer users:  &lt;bold&gt;attached text<br>
file ~316K&lt;/bold&gt; - you<br>
<p>
     must know how to download an attached text file and then be able<br>
to<br>
<p>
     open it with your word processor.  If in doubt, don't ask for<br>
this<br>
<p>
     version.  This isn't for internet *newbies.* Better to order<br>
option 1<br>
<p>
     and spend a few minutes pasting them into one whole text document<br>
<p>
     with your word processor, than to waste hours trying to figure<br>
how<br>
<p>
     to deal with this option.   This version is great for doing word<br>
<p>
     searches and jumping around within the catalogue with your word <br>
<p>
     processing software, if your normal email reading software doesn't<br>
<p>
<p>
     allow this.<br>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;3. &lt;/bold&gt; For more advanced &lt;bold&gt;Macintosh&lt;/bold&gt; computer<br>
users: compressed attached<br>
<p>
     text file, created with a &lt;bold&gt;Stuffit(tm) self-extracting<br>
archive (.sea),<br>
<p>
    ~140K.&lt;/bold&gt;  Can be decompressed by any Macintosh computer user;<br>
no<br>
<p>
     special expansion software or knowledge of Stuffit (tm) needed. <br>
You<br>
<p>
     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands<br>
<p>
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as<br>
<p>
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will<br>
cut<br>
<p>
     your download time by 55%.   Expands out to the same ~316K file<br>
in<br>
<p>
     option #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to<br>
be<br>
<p>
     able to do.<br>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;4.&lt;/bold&gt;  For expert &lt;bold&gt;mac or pc computer users&lt;/bold&gt;:<br>
compressed attached text file, <br>
<p>
     created with &lt;bold&gt;Stuffit(tm),  ~116K&lt;/bold&gt;.  Can be<br>
decompressed by any <br>
<p>
     computer user who has expansion software to decompress (expand) <br>
<p>
     Stuffit(tm)&lt;bold&gt; (.sit)&lt;/bold&gt; files.  This is for more advanced<br>
computer users only<br>
<p>
      and will cut your download time by 63%.   Expands out to the same<br>
<p>
<p>
     ~316K file in option#2.  See option #2 for more info on what you<br>
will <br>
<p>
     need to be able to do.<br>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;5.&lt;/bold&gt;  For expert pc or mac computer users: &lt;bold&gt;compressed<br>
attached text file, <br>
<p>
    in a .zip file format, ~143K. &lt;/bold&gt;  Can be decompressed by any<br>
computer<br>
<p>
      user who has expansion software to decompress (expand) .zip<br>
files.<br>
<p>
      This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your <br>
<p>
      download time by 54%.   Expands out to the same  ~316K file in <br>
<p>
      option#2.   See option #2 for more info on what you will need to<br>
be<br>
<p>
      able to do.<br>

&lt;bold&gt;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;FFFF,0000,0000&lt;/param&gt;&lt;bigger&gt;&lt;bigger&gt;&lt;bigger&gt;VERY<br>
IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT YOU GET A<br>
REPLY:&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
1.   you must call from an "unblocked number," ie. one that is not<br>
blocked from caller id.  We are very sorry for this requirement, but<br>
our fax software requires this before it allows an incoming fax call to<br>
connect.   If you have a blocked number, you must first unblock it.  In<br>
most cases this means dialing *82 from a touch-tone phone (or 1182 from<br>
a rotary phone) before you dial 1-718-227-9125.     NOTE:  If you are<br>
not sure if your number is blocked, just try dialing our fax #<br>
normally.  If you don't get a recording telling you your number is<br>
blocked, your number has been transmitted and you may press the start<br>
button on your fax when you hear the fax tone from our fax.<br>
<p>
2.   no reply forms can be accepted by email....only via fax or smail. <br>
 <br>
<p>
3.   your form must be typewritten or printed out on your computer<br>
printer before you fax it;  ie. no handwritten forms can be accepted.<br>
<p>
4.   faxes with cover pages will be rejected.  You must send *only* the<br>
reply form.<br>
<p>
5.   forms not *completely* filled in will not be acknowledged.<br>
<p>
6.   you will receive a reply within 1 business day directly from the<br>
company making the offer via email.  Therefore you must have an email<br>
address.  If you read this message, then you must have an email<br>
address, or access to one, at least.   :-)<br>
<p>
7.   your fax must not exceed 1 page in length.   Faxes of 2 or more<br>
pages will be sensed, then auto-terminated and deleted.  Your fax goes<br>
directly onto our 5.0 gigabyte hard drive and we must limit all<br>
incoming faxes to 1 page.<br>
<p>
8.   all faxes must begin with:<br>
<p>
*------------cut<br>
here/begin-------------------------------------------*<br>
<p>
and must end with:<br>
<p>
*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*<br>
<p>
9. Any fax not conforming to this format will be sensed by our<br>
software, then auto-terminated and deleted from the hard drive, before<br>
any human ever gets to see it.<br>
<p>
10.  If this all seems too complicated for faxing, just do it the old<br>
fashioned way via smail!!!<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;WHO WE ARE:&lt;/bold&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
Tempting Tear-Outs is an advertising company that brings potential new<br>
customers to the companies they advertise for.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;MORE ABOUT THE COMPANY MAKING THE FREE OFFER:&lt;/bold&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
The company making the offer is a magazine subscription agency based in<br>
the USA.  They have over 1,500 popular USA titles available to be<br>
shipped to *any* country, including of course, to anywhere in the USA! <br>
  &lt;bold&gt;&lt;underline&gt;They offer a FREE 1 yr. subscription to your choice<br>
of over 270 of the titles in their catalogue to any new customer using<br>
them for the first time.&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;       The  dollar value of<br>
the freebies, based on the subscription prices directly from the<br>
publishers, ranges from $6.97 all the way up to $50.00!<br>
<p>
<p>
For new customers in the USA, there is no charge for FPH (foreign<br>
postage &amp; handling), so the freebie is 100% free!   For new customers<br>
living overseas, the only charge on the freebie would be for the FPH<br>
(foreign postage &amp; handling).<br>
<p>
<p>
Their president has been in the magazine subscription business since<br>
1973 and they are very customer-service oriented.   They will even help<br>
you with address changes on your magazines, even if you move from one<br>
country to another country.   They have thousands of happy customers in<br>
over 59 countries.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;Their price guarantee is very simple:       they guarantee that<br>
their subscription prices are the lowest available and they will BEAT<br>
any legitimate, verifiable offer before you pay them or match it<br>
afterwards, by refunding you the difference in price PLUS the cost of<br>
the postage stamp you would use sending in the special offer to them,<br>
even 6 months after you pay them, as long as it was current at the time<br>
of your offer.    Does that sound fair?       Wouldn't it be great if<br>
everything you bought came with that price guarantee? &lt;/bold&gt; <br>
<p>
<p>
Sometimes they are less than half of the next best deal out there,<br>
sometimes just a little cheaper, but always you get the lowest rates<br>
without having to shop around.     With 1,500 titles on their list,<br>
they would like to think that they have also the best selection<br>
around!<br>
<p>
<p>
Within the USA, for their USA customers, they are cheaper than all<br>
their competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their<br>
price guarantee.         The 1 yr. freebie that you get with your first<br>
order is completely free!   <br>
<p>
<p>
Overseas, (even after you factor in the cost of the FPH (foreign<br>
postage &amp; handling) and the conversion from USA Dollars to your<br>
currency), on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to<br>
one-half of what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA<br>
magazines.  On some titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the<br>
newsstands charge.  They are also the cheapest subscription source for<br>
delivery overseas, including directly from the publishers themselves!  <br>
Some publishers don't even offer subscriptions overseas.........but<br>
overseas subscriptions are this company's specialty!  They feel that<br>
magazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people buy<br>
magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes<br>
or hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would<br>
like to make it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also<br>
cheaper than all their competitors in the USA and overseas, including<br>
the publishers themselves!   It is also *highly unlikely* you will find<br>
any of their USA competitors calling you overseas, in order to offer<br>
that personal touch, just to sell you a couple of magazines!  But that<br>
is what this company specializes in and loves doing!     Around<br>
one-half their business comes from overseas, so they are very patient<br>
with new members who only speak limited English as a 2nd language.   <br>
Subscription prices quoted for overseas consist of the subscription<br>
price, plus the FPH.   You add the two together and that is your total<br>
cost.   The exception is the 1 yr. freebie you get with your first<br>
order.   On that title, you pay *only* the FPH for the 1 yr. term.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;&lt;underline&gt;Their prices are so cheap because when you deal with<br>
them, you cut-out all the middlemen.&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;&lt;bigger&gt;&lt;bigger&gt;HERE IS HOW YOU CAN GET MORE INFO AND GET STARTED<br>
WITH THEM:&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;Simply fax or smail back to us the reply form listed at the top<br>
of this message.&lt;/bold&gt;   We will then forward your form on to the<br>
subscription agency.  They will then email their "big and juicy"<br>
catalogue to you, in whichever of the four formats you chose.   The<br>
catalogue is FREE and makes for hours of fascinating reading, on its<br>
own. It includes the complete list of freebies, a complete list of all<br>
the titles they sell, as well as detailed descriptions on most of the<br>
titles, along with lists of titles by category of interest and their<br>
terms of sale.    <br>
<p>
<p>
They will then give you a friendly, no-pressure, no obligation,<br>
5-minute call to go over how they work and to answer any questions that<br>
you might have, as well as give you up-to-the minute price quotes on<br>
any titles you might be considering.     They will call you in whatever<br>
country you live in, taking the time difference into account.        As<br>
they like to emphasize the personal touch they give to each new<br>
customer, all first-time orders can only be done via phone, so they can<br>
answer all your questions completely and personally.   Once you have<br>
placed your first order via phone, you will be able to place future<br>
orders and make inquiries on your account, get price quotes, etc., all<br>
via email, if that is most convenient for you.<br>
<p>
<p>
Within the USA, they accept payment via check over the phone,<br>
Mastercard, Visa and American Express.      Overseas, they accept<br>
Mastercard, Visa and American Express, even if your credit card is a<br>
local one in local currency!<br>
<p>
<p>
That's our introduction of our client that we represent.   We hope that<br>
we have piqued your interest and that you will take the next step to<br>
get their free catalogue!   Thank you for your time and interest.<br>
