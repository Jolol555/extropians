<i>&gt; &gt; I did read Calvin's "The Throwing Madonna" a few years ago, I have not read</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; his "The Cerebral Code", except for a few pages I thumbed through in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bookstore. The trouble I have with his idea is that throwing an object with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; power and accuracy is the most complex, difficult, motion you can put your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; arm through,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It may not be, but it is likely to be the motion most connected to your</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetic survival.  And, as Calvin points out, it takes a hell of a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; neurons to get the release timing down to the point you can hit targets.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The basic problem is that the timing jitter of nerve cells is way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; high, so high that when Calvin first started thinking about the problem,</i><br>
<i>&gt; he could not figure out how we could hit *anything*.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I will certainly argue that a lot of animals humans hunted were much</i><br>
<i>&gt; larger than the strike zone!  They also hunted in groups, where any one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them getting in a good one was enough.  And while living to 35 was</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely plenty to pass on genes, I very much doubt a hunting group got</i><br>
<i>&gt; that many opportunities to hit something in a day, certainly not as many</i><br>
<i>&gt; throws as a baseball pitcher will make.</i><br>
<p>
The big difference between baseball and rockball, is that your prehuman<br>
only had to throw ONE strike a day to live til tomorrow (maybe a few<br>
more to be fat and happy), rather than a whole nine innnings a day (its<br>
the repetition while strained that causes the most wear and tear on<br>
pitcher's arms).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;it seems that pre humans got along just fine as projectile</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;hunters using hand axes thrown discus style into groups of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;animals at water holes/streams for millions of years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                   &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This might be true but could have nothing to do with the development of &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; bipedalism. Lucy was as bipedal as you or me but it would be a million years</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; later before anybody on earth had a hand ax or a tool.</i><br>
<p>
How old was Lucy? I just read today's paper that announced the discovery<br>
of a cache of tools found in Ethiopia near Olduvai that were between<br>
2.5-2.6 million years old. THis is older by a few hundred thousand years<br>
the first known appearance of the genus Homo, which possibly puts late<br>
australopithecus right in the tool making camp.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So much context has been lost that I am not sure how this ran, but I think my</i><br>
<i>&gt; point was that bipetalism was a prerequisite for throwing.  My point was</i><br>
<i>&gt; how the big expansion grew out of the earlier adaptionsaddaptions to projectile</i><br>
<i>&gt; hunting which a chimp sized brain could support.</i><br>
<p>
I like the scavenger idea, where prehumans were, outside of digging<br>
roots, scavengers that had to compete with predators and other<br>
scavengers for meat. Having to be bipedal to have hands free to tear and<br>
carry flesh quickly away from the killsite, as well as to throw rocks in<br>
defense against other animals seems rather logical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;In such an environment, really good projectile throwing made</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;the difference between a line which left a lot of descendants</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;and one which left none.  Calvin argues (very well I think)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                 &gt;that this is what drove the expansion of the human brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that if Evolution was only interested in solving one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; particular problem, rather than problems in general, it would have developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an elaborate throwing reflex, not intelligence. Then again, Evolution never</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; does things the easy sensible way, so maybe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Calvin argues that the expansion of the brain for throwing hauled along</i><br>
<i>&gt; many, many other things.  The same motion sequencer that is used to throw</i><br>
<i>&gt; rocks he proposes gets used when not throwing for such things as</i><br>
<i>&gt; generating sentences.</i><br>
<p>
As well as multitasking: having to think about selecting the most<br>
usefull flesh quickly while being aware of and prepared to switch jobs<br>
to throw rocks at encroaching animals. Seems like Lucy had a lot to<br>
think about.....<br>
