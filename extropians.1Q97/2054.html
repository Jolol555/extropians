I think you are a bit too harsh here. We can't list for certain *every*<br>
nutrient we need, but we can make a quite good list of those we know of,<br>
and they make up most of the food we eat (the unknown ones are most likely<br>
present in the same food that is rich in the known nutrients). A bit<br>
harder is optimal dosages, there is a big interindividual variability and<br>
experimental uncertainties (the RDA is after all just "recommended"). <br>
<p>
As others have pointed out, the best way of getting the necessary<br>
nutrients right now at a reasonable price is just healthy food, eating a<br>
chemical mixture is bound to be expensive and unpalatable.  See nutrition<br>
and health websites for discussions of a good diet. <br>
<p>

<i>&gt; model short-lived and cheap enough to test.</i><br>
<p>
CR looks promising, but it is most likely very hard to turn directly from <br>
a normal diet to a CR diet; instead it is most likely a good idea to <br>
first starte eating healthy low-calorie food, and once you have made that <br>
a habit move towards CR. A direct jump is bound to lead to hunger and <br>
motivation problems. <br>
