I think the generally accepted explanation for time asymmetry goes to<br>
boundary conditions at the beginning and end of the universe.  For some<br>
reason the early universe had very low entropy, so if you look at it as<br>
a four dimensional object you see a gradient of increasing entropy in the<br>
time direction away from the origin.  This is what we perceive as the<br>
arrow of time.  (I don't know if there is a good theory for why this<br>
asymmetry in the buondary conditions exists.)<br>
<p>
You could imagine a situation where some parts of the universe had low<br>
entropy at one end, and other parts had low entropy at the other end.<br>
Then for this to lead to a consistent solution, the existence of what<br>
we would perceive as causality paradoxes must be prevented somehow; only<br>
universes in which such paradoxes never happen to occur would be legal<br>
solutions to the equations with those boundary conditions.<br>
<p>
These kinds of considerations are often invoked to explain what would happen<br>
in other causality-challenging situations, like the closed timelike lines<br>
which appear in some exotic systems of GR.  You simply postulate that only<br>
the universes in which the local laws of physics are observed can exist.<br>
However this ends up looking like the Hand of God reaching down to stop you<br>
from doing things which would produce a paradox.<br>
<p>
I remember a comic book I read once where Superboy tried to go back<br>
into time and prevent the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  Oops, he<br>
ran into some red Kryptonite which paralyzed him for just long enough<br>
to prevent him from changing history.  This kind of thing would be<br>
happening constantly if time travel were possible or if you had the<br>
kind of bi-directional entropy gradients described above.  The harder<br>
you try to outwit the universe, the harder it would fight back.  It seems<br>
like a pretty implausible way for things to be.<br>
