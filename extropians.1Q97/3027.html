In a message dated 97-02-28 15:03:36 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 And yet I wonder whether people really want to understand the <br>
 creative process, because having a basic knowledge of how it <br>
 functions would remove a lot of excuses for not developing that set <br>
 of skills, and taking the leap into unknown areas of life.  <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
[So they say it's totally subjective, and meaningless...]<br>
<p>
AHA!! Kathryn you have hit on what i consider to be a MAJOR truth, re;<br>
critics and  speculators (routinely on this list, scientists and tech people,<br>
but in the real world, any layperson) not taking responsiblity for<br>
themselves, and the belief that art is a totally subjective field, a<br>
biproduct of man's psyche, rather than a field of infinite posiblities for<br>
(as you have suggested many times in your posts) communication, functionality<br>
and quality.<br>
<p>
Art, creativity, in its many forms- including design, communicates<br>
nonverbally, causes things to form ( by plan or example) , and creativity is<br>
an integral part of improving the quality of life, even as much as, but<br>
certainly in conjunction with, technology. The laziness you speak of is<br>
rarely confronted in this forum, and I thank you for your insight. <br>
<p>
up and out, <br>
Nadia <br>
