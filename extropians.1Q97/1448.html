Omega, your "Free Will vs Group Think" post of 1/27/97 is excellent.  It is<br>
always a pleasure to see reason in play.<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;Since science, by definition, does not deal with the unknowable<br>
(except for defining the boundaries of such) the scientific appraisal of<br>
free will is limited to refuting its presence wherever predictibility can<br>
be found.  This leads to an operative principle which places knowable<br>
limits on where free will may be found as defined in its classical sense:<br>
<p>
*  Where something is predictable, then free will does not exist.&gt;<br>
<p>
A slight refinement to make this more precise, predictable here means "with<br>
certainty."  Prediction with less than 100% statistical confidence is,<br>
after all, just guesswork.  Is an entity forced to make predictions in<br>
order to find out if the entity has free will?  &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;...once we strip out all references to local truth in this new<br>
definition of free will, we are back to one of two possibilities:<br>
<p>
a. Either free will does not exist at all...<br>
<p>
b. Or, through some form of trancendent acausality in keeping with the<br>
first<br>
   meaning, some limited form of free will does exist...<br>
<p>
And now that quantum physics has clearly been shown to be unable to tell us<br>
whether our reality is even a deterministic one or not, the whole subject<br>
is<br>
right back in the realm of philosophy/theology/metaphysics.&gt;<br>
<p>
Since the necessity of indeterministic quantum physics has forced us to go<br>
back to philosophy now, I would like to post a couple quotes on point b<br>
(point a being obviously worthless because I am choosing to respond of my<br>
own free will) from Karl Jaspers' "Way to Wisdom" (Yale Univ. Press, 1951):<br>
<p>
"The highest freedom is experienced in freedom from the world, and this<br>
freedom is a profound bond with transcendence....  [M]astery over one's<br>
ideas remains ambivalent ­ does it mean an arbitrary freedom from ties or<br>
does it imply ties in transcendence?  Because of this ambivalence,<br>
independence, instead of becoming a road to authentic selfhood in historic<br>
fulfilment, can easily be confused with irresponsibility, or the perpetual<br>
availability for something else.  Then selfhood is lost, and all that<br>
remains is different roles played in different situations."<br>
<p>
"Indeed, independence in the world implies a particular attitude toward the<br>
world:  to be in it and yet not in it, to be both inside it and outside it.<br>
 Independence does not derive its content from itself.  It is not any<br>
innate gift, it is not vitality, race, the will to power, it is not<br>
self-creation....  Our independence itself requires help.  We can only do<br>
our best and hope that something within us - invisible to the world ­ will<br>
in some unfathomable way come to our aid and lift us out of our<br>
limitations.  The only independence possible for us is dependence on<br>
transcendence."<br>
<p>
I admit I am aesthetically attracted to a well-turned phrase such as<br>
'dependence on transcendence,' perhaps this influences my rationality, but<br>
I must say I find the argument to be logical that "independence does not<br>
derive its content from itself," that it "requires help."  Overemphasis on<br>
the subjectivity of the humanistic world leads to the irresponsible<br>
role-playing outlined in the first paragraph (and that I see so much of in<br>
the world today), but overemphasis on the objectivity of the scientific<br>
world leads to loss of free will through either iron determinism or<br>
nihilistic randomness, a servility and docility with practical consequences<br>
for extropic ascension as bad as the irresponsible role-playing.  My<br>
subjective consciousness is certainly independent of the objective being<br>
that surrounds me, how can this be when I travel from one to the other and<br>
find no border?  I think the last sentence of the second paragraph must be<br>
true.  <br>
Omega: &lt;If extropians want to be at the forefront of "some extropian<br>
transition", we might consider what is necessary to disengage us from the<br>
natural human tendency to form closed thought systems so that we can<br>
somehow avoid repeating history.&gt;<br>
<p>
Sounds like we need another "Warding Off Dogmatization" panel discussion<br>
such as we had at Extro-1.<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;How can we even think we're going to conquer personal death until<br>
we first conquer the death of social systems.&gt;<br>
<p>
We attempt to preserve what we love.  Too many individuals do not love<br>
social systems because they cannot comprehend how they can maintain their<br>
independence within a system, their behavior defaults to "irresponsible<br>
role-playing."  A rejection of all notion of societal duty and authority,<br>
in order to vapidly assert a pseudo-independence, is the dominant Western<br>
worldview conceptual attractor because it takes less energy to fall into,<br>
than the difficult comprehension of what the serious thinkers of the<br>
Renaissance, Enlightenment and Counter-Reformation were directing us<br>
towards.  The syncretic philosophy of Pico Della Mirandola pointed toward a<br>
conjunction of the philosophies of Voltaire and Joseph de Maistre that we<br>
have yet to realize.  We need to pull ourselves out of the conceptual<br>
doldrums we find ourselves in, regain the trade winds, and spend time and<br>
energy achieving extropic purposes, instead of drifting along day-to-day in<br>
an animal existence.  What's new, huh?<br>
