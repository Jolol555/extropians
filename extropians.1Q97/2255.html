<i>&gt; &gt; (7) Other complex forms will evolve to continue themselves and use</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   resources at my expense if they can.  To ensure the continuation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   my consciousness, therefore, it is in my interest to learn as much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   as I can about the nature of such systems, and to create technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   that successfully defend against them.  Because of (5), this is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   course of action most likely to lead to my goal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Really?  So the logical course of action for a Power would be to stomp</i><br>
<i>&gt; on you before you stomped back.  Similarly, the logical course of action</i><br>
<i>&gt; on my part would be to stomp on you before you stomped out my precious</i><br>
<i>&gt; Singularity.  I prefer to think that cooperation between sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent beings is axiomatic - that is, any two Powers will cooperate</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the Prisoner's Dilemna.  You apparently believe it is axiomatic that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they will both defect.</i><br>
<p>
I used the word "defend".  Why you interpreted that to mean "stomp<br>
on them before they stomp on you" is something you'll have to examine<br>
about your own mind, not mine.  I expect most defense will be against<br>
non-powers, not against other powers.  Since I--a lowly human being--<br>
understand the nature of the prisoner's dilemma and the value of<br>
cooperation, I would assume no less from another power.  But there<br>
will evolve beings without that realization for whom predation is the<br>
method of choice.  Not just non-sentient carnivores, but predators of<br>
the human sort as well.  To deny the possibility of crime and other<br>
irrational behaviors in posthumans is to willfully ignore the facts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Putting the ethical issues aside, seeing as how neither of us is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Power, consider that saying you'll do your best to stamp out all other</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentient entities is not a good idea.  They might stamp first.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Generally speaking, trying to maximize your share of the pie as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative-sum game is a bad strategy, because if everyone follows it, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; pie shrinks...</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, which is why I never said such a horrible thing.  I said<br>
quite precisely that my /only/ goal was to preserve my own consciousness.<br>
Not to destroy or impede others.  Indeed, I can't do it without free<br>
trade and innovation and specialization of others. <br>
<p>
The game changes when technology changes.  Until immortality was a<br>
reasonable possibility, my ethic would not have made sense.  After I<br>
and other powers have expanded into the universe so far that further<br>
progress cannot be made but at the expense of others--if that happens--<br>
then the rules will change again.  But we're not there yet.  Since our<br>
ability to exploit resources is miniscule, technology makes trade and<br>
<i>&gt; So I reject your philosophy on the grounds that it wouldn't work if</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone followed it, and in fact won't even work for you because others</i><br>
<i>&gt; will become aware that you intend to use coercive force to steal their</i><br>
<i>&gt; shares, and will launch a preemptive strike.</i><br>
<p>
I quite explicitly reached laissez-faire capitalism as a consequence<br>
of my ethic, yet you claim otherwise.  Did you just get bored reading<br>
to the end, or did I not explain that clearly enough?  I believe my<br>
exact words were "property rights, free trade, benevolence, and the<br>
rejection of force".  What part of that was unclear?<br>
