What Jim Legg DOES understand is that our current system of production and<br>
the WAY in wich it is valued, is rapidly changing.<br>
<p>
I doubt if the system he proposes would work, as few people would be<br>
inclined to become more productive, as they would know anyway it wasn't<br>
going to do them any good. Viewed in this way, he may be a neo socialist,<br>
leftist etc. But viewed from the RATIONAL point of view that value in<br>
Money, isn't allways the same as the effective or real value, he offers<br>
some interesting points for discussion.<br>
<p>
The Real value of production. <br>
<p>
Occupating oneself with production of goods and services that are not<br>
neseccarily meant to increase ones wealth, are important for society in two<br>
ways.<br>
<p>
1) The enrichment of your personal individual development. (note that this<br>
includes, science, memes, and possibly this list :-) ) <br>
<p>
2) The productions that aren't commercially exploitable straight away, but<br>
that carry the seeds for the possibility to become so. (note that this<br>
includes research etc.)<br>
<p>
Any system that ingnores these, or has a low tollerance and high barrier<br>
levels for personal, and individual initiative, is doomed to halt progress.<br>
Not seeing the benefits of your production does the same in a socialist<br>
society, but not having money to begin with, to start initiatives is a very<br>
severe limiting factor in a capitalist society.<br>
<p>
Being a slave of money, spending all ones effort on gathering resources can<br>
severely limit the individuals personal development,  in other areas than<br>
the area of production he is asking money for, and the chances he has, of<br>
ever commercially exploiting one of the other areas. <br>
<p>
In fact the current system thrives on specialization to a point where it's<br>
influence on the individuals development can become questionable, and<br>
possibly counterproductive to society as a whole.<br>
<p>
Jim is very right in observing that what he calls 'a ruling class' are<br>
people who have the benefit of exploring these other areas better, as their<br>
wealth allows them to do so. Whereas they don't really need to (for reason<br>
2 that is!), as they have already found a succesful way to provide for<br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
Secondly, Jim has observed correctly that the value of goods and services<br>
is shifting from value expressed in money, to more abstract definitions of<br>
that value. The Internet probably serves as the best example, (freeware,<br>
and making information available for free, but also various copyrights<br>
violations.) Many types of businesses will find they cannot compete with<br>
free services offered on the web anymore, as the quality of the free<br>
services offered is often higher than those of the commercial services. <br>
<p>
Whatever happens, our capitalist system is changing, and to ignore that, is<br>
just as 'tradidional or shortsighted' as calling Jim traditional or<br>
shortsighted.  <br>
<p>
Personally i prefer a free market sytem, but i would refrain from   saying<br>
it is the 'perfect' situation, and that problems that exist are not<br>
structural with regards to the system, but incidental. Anyone who does is<br>
ignoring the roots of certain problems in society. Never would i say that<br>
there is no room for improvement, even structural. I think doing so is very<br>
dangerous, as contentment often kills inventiveness...<br>
