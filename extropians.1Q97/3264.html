In a message dated 97-03-05 13:26:52 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; I suspect that the situation is a little more complicated than simply<br>
HIV=AIDs. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Even Gallo said HIV is not the only cause, nobody has said that after a<br>
little peer review. <br>
 <br>
I don't even personally recognize Gallo (et all 13 of them) as the "official"<br>
discoverer of HIV (then called HTLV-3) in 1984.  I would have given HIV's<br>
discovery to the Pasteur Institute in 1983:  <br>
Barre-Sinoussi,  <br>
Nuguyre,  <br>
Dauguet,  <br>
Vilmer,  <br>
Griscelli,  <br>
Bran-Vezinet,  <br>
Rouzioux,  <br>
Gluckman,  <br>
Chermann and Montagnier <br>
 <br>
It looks to me like Gallo got a clue from the French, saw a good thing (HIV<br>
is one of the causes of AIDS) and quickly "office politics 'ed" the US<br>
government to declare the discovery to Americans before the French beat them<br>
to it. <br>
 <br>
The U.S. government was duped.  Far from "inventing" HIV as Louis Farrakhon<br>
had said (in 1989) to drum up support for government hate via conspiracy<br>
theory (another good money making business, the conspiracy business).  <br>
<p>
To say HIV is what the "government" says causes AIDS shows how affective<br>
Gallo has been pushing the Pasteur Institute out of the lime light.   Unless<br>
you mean the FRENCH government!  ;-)<br>
<p>
The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) (is not a government group)<br>
writes a lot on HIV as one cause of AIDS.  The Manual of Clinical<br>
Microbiology had a lot of good information.  I have been a member of ASM<br>
since 1976.  <br>
