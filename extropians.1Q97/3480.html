I must say, I am so busy working that this discourse has continued on<br>
without me. Let me point out, Johnny disagreed with silicon, and for good<br>
reason. <br>
We are not far beyond that. What we are doing now is taking a look at other<br>
possibilities.  The posters will be figurative and photographic because this<br>
is an area I am experienced in.  The posters will also be based on as much<br>
scientific and technological fact as possible because this is how I produce<br>
my work. I wouldn't have it any other way.<br>
