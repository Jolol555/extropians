<i>&gt;Given nanotech, transhuman/posthuman skin may look like anything we please.</i><br>
<i>&gt;See the active tattoos in Snowcrash, or flicker cladding in Rucker's</i><br>
<i>&gt;Software. Our virtual bodies in virtual worlds could easily look however we</i><br>
<i>&gt;want. Whether in VR or not, why shouldn't future skin look like silicon?</i><br>
<p>
Future skin. That's the problem.. I don't object to art for art's sake, but<br>
you can't seriously think that in the future we're going to have silicon<br>
skin. If you do, you're entitled to your opinion, but I think it's<br>
irresponsible to make that the view of a movement. As we've learned from the<br>
past, the future's going to look alot like it looks now. Quite frankly,<br>
silicon skin is a cliche from bad scifi.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All silicon compounds are rigid, huh? I suppose all those women with</i><br>
<i>&gt;silicone breast implants must be really solid upfront then.</i><br>
<p>
Aha! Silicone! Not Silicon. Silicone is a silicon compound. That's like<br>
saying that because Iron (Fe) can't be dissolved in water, neither can any<br>
Iron compounds. I didn't say all silicon COMPOUNDS, that would be incredibly<br>
stupid. But the element Silicon (Si), used as a semiconductor is not a<br>
compound, it is the element.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Drop the rudeness, buddy. You're new to this list and need to learn how to</i><br>
<i>&gt;communicate effectively. If you can't make your points with finenesse, go</i><br>
<i>&gt;somewhere else.</i><br>
<p>
I like being rude, it makes people pay attention. It's not like I called<br>
anyone a poopyhead.<br>
