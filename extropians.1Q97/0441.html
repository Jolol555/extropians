<p>
I would commission a world, perhaps housed in a big block of diamondoid<br>
nanoprocessors or something similar that showed views from it on all<br>
sides. The tricky part is that I would demand that the laws of nature in<br>
the world would give rise to complexity just as high or higher than in our<br>
world; the artwork would evolve and develop on its own, and the viewers<br>
would see how it unfolded. Something like the Autoverse in _Permutation <br>
City_, or the alife simulations mentioned in _The Broken God_.<br>
<p>
Being able to create something like this is one of my highest wishes.<br>
