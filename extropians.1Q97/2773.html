[Sorry for delayed response to messages; I've been distracted<br>
accepting a new position for the next two years (as a health policy<br>
scholar at UC Berkeley).]<br>

I wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; What happened is that people were informed in more vivid detail about</i><br>

<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Oh, come now.  Do you seriously suggest that throughout the centuries</i><br>
<i>&gt;of slavery in every society in the world, that the people were just</i><br>
<i>&gt;/uninformed/ about what it was like?   That argument might explain why</i><br>
<i>&gt;it took US consumers a while to catch on to child labor in the third</i><br>
<i>&gt;world, but you can bet your last greenback that everyone in Guatemala</i><br>
<i>&gt;knows exactly what goes on in a sweatshop, and they approve.  Americans</i><br>
<i>&gt;always knew exactly what slavery was, just as every other enslaver in</i><br>
<i>&gt;history has, they simply chose to approve of it and justify it until</i><br>
<i>&gt;the moral opposition gained enough power to change it.</i><br>
<p>
Guru George similarly responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Sorry, this just doesn't wash.  People knew damn well what was going on</i><br>
<i>&gt;(well enough to know it was wrong), same as in Germany and Poland where</i><br>
<i>&gt;they had concentration camps next door.  They just rationalised/justified</i><br>
<i>&gt;it, same as people rationalise/justify government. What changed things</i><br>
<i>&gt;was people *declaring* that it was wrong, and declaring that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;rationalisations and justifications were excuses for evil.</i><br>
<p>
You're saying that people who exactly what slavery was like, they just<br>
didn't realize it was "immoral"?  I find this hard to fathom.   I<br>
instead see two major changes from the past:<br>
1)  People were getting richer, and richer folks can better afford to<br>
indulge their "moral" feelings. <br>
2)  U.S. slave were unusual in history: the slave population grew locally.<br>
In contrast, most slaves were spoils of war/domination imported from<br>
elsewhere, and who didn't reproduce very well locally.  Its lots<br>
easier to be cruel to foreigners than to locals.  <br>
<p>
Eric Watt Forste writes:<br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps libertarians should set up pen-pal relationships with people who</i><br>
<i>&gt;are in prison for victimless crimes such as tax evasion, drug dealing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc. That would give them something concretely unpleasant to talk about</i><br>
<i>&gt;in vivid detail during their political arguments with their friends.</i><br>
<p>
I think the biggest problem this this re tax evasion is that most<br>
people find it hard to imagine a functioning society with government<br>
taxes.  In contrast, abolitionists could easily imagine socities<br>
without slaves.  To the extent you can point to places that function<br>
without restrictive drug laws, you may have better luck there. <br>
