There is a separate belief needed, as to whether private property is<br>
theft or not.  The term libertarian was first used as a movement by<br>
anarcho-syndicalists or similar types in the 19th century; most of the<br>
first libertarians were socialists, or rather had Left goals, but were<br>
more anarchist in their means than most current day, propertarian<br>
libertarians.  Kropotkin, Bakunin, Proudhon.  Kropotkin at least had<br>
good criticism of much societal ill, especially prisons; I'm not so sure<br>
what sort of economy he did want to see.  I don't think there are very<br>
many Proudhonites active these days; I've seen some on the net; many of<br>
those have had a higher coherence and complexity of thought than those<br>
they were debating with, either usual socialists or modern libertarians.<br>
Again, absent a good and specific vision (that I can see) of how they<br>
would want society to work.  Many of them also still resent the<br>
propertarian co-option of 'libertarian'.<br>
<p>
Of course, if we gave them back libertarian by the same logic we could<br>
go back to being liberal, which term I prefer anyway.<br>
<p>
Weird experience: on the same day reading a Nation article decrying<br>
NAFTA and GATT, and a BusinessWeek article praising the increasing<br>
liberalization of world trade.<br>
