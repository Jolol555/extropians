<i>          &gt;Why do people seem so damn confident of their political </i><br>
<i>          &gt;opinions?</i><br>
          <br>
          There must be many factors that play a part. Here are some <br>
          speculations:<br>
          <br>
          1. People believe that something like Western democracy is a <br>
          good thing, perhaps because they compare it to other <br>
          political systems that have been tried in the past and found <br>
          worse.<br>
          <br>
          2. Western democracy functions by means of a class of <br>
          politicians want to be elected. They are elected if they <br>
          succeede in convincing the populace that their particular <br>
          policy would be good.<br>
          <br>
          3. A politician who appears to be confident about his views <br>
          tend to be more convincing than one who appears hesitant, <br>
          uncertain, and who frequently points out weak spots in his <br>
          own argument.<br>
          <br>
          4. So politicians become confident, through precept as well <br>
          as though voter's selection.<br>
          <br>
          5. When the public sees all the great names in politics <br>
          appearing very confident, it tend to believe that that is <br>
          the proper way to argue politics, and it immitates.<br>
          <br>
          6. Moreover, many people believe that political science is <br>
          much less advanced than physics, say, so that they regard it <br>
          as more legitimate to have stong views about politics <br>
          without having studied political science than to have strong <br>
          views about controversial physical phenomena whithout having <br>
          studied physics. In any case, the academic experts typically <br>
          fail to come forth with an unanimous view on controversial <br>
          political issues.<br>
          <br>
          7. People tend to associate according to political outlook <br>
          (I guess), and so their views become reinforced by an <br>
          external positive feedback loop.<br>
          <br>
          8. Since the top politicians (who in the public's view are <br>
          the political authorities) are usually not selected for <br>
          their outstanding knowledge of political or social science <br>
          etc., but rather for carisma and such, the public tend to <br>
          believe that knowledge of political science is not very <br>
          relevant to politics.<br>
          <br>
          9. People are encouraged to form their own political <br>
          opinions, perhaps because that is regarded as beneficial for <br>
          a democratic system. Non-voters are derided.<br>
          <br>
          10. Many political disagrements are based on fundamental <br>
          value differences, and people tend to know very well what <br>
          they value, so no wonder they speak with conviction about <br>
          such issues. Often these value disagreements come down to a <br>
          bias in favour of solutions that are perceived as <br>
          benefitting the voter (egoism).<br>
          <br>
          11. Political questions are often so big that to take a <br>
          stand on them has consequences for ones whole outlook on the <br>
          world and one's fellow citizens. This makes it difficult for <br>
          many to adopt a detached, objective approach to political <br>
          questions; rather many people's political views are choosen <br>
          so as to harmonise with their personal experiences (and with <br>
          the political views of the peole around them).<br>
          <br>
          12. Politics might appeal to the same instincts as sport: <br>
          the feeling of belonging to a group, of combat, we/them, may <br>
          take priority over a genuine concern to find the right <br>
          answers.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Personally, I think that people with over-confident <br>
          political opinions deserve a good flogging, for intellectual <br>
          irresponsibility is the cause of an incalculable amount of <br>
          suffering and retardation of progress in the world, I <br>
          believe.<br>
