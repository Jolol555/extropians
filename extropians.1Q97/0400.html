<i>&gt;what you have said your world is far too... not certain... *solid*.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;blithely speak of answering the First Cause with the Anthropic Principle</i><br>
<i>&gt;and say life has "many" meanings if asked why you get out of bed in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;morning.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Doubting is only *mere* fun when you doubt only the deep surface issues</i><br>
<i>&gt;like political conflicts and your emotional motivations.  When your</i><br>
<i>&gt;Doubting has reduced your entire goal system to a shambles, so that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot even walk across a room without wondering why, you will take</i><br>
<i>&gt;Doubt a bit more seriously.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps I take Doubt so seriously that I have deep need to maintain a sense<br>
of humor about it in order to prevent it from overwhelming my soul with these<br>
kinds of troubles. Perhaps I think there are far too many people in the world<br>
wandering around torturing each other with their value crises instead of<br>
living their lives and enjoying them, and I don't want to set a bad example<br>
by doing more of the same. I think it's a good idea on mailing lists like<br>
these not to make presumptions about how far we are actually seeing into one<br>
another's heads. (Except when deliberately trying to annoy someone... I do<br>
this occasionally.)<br>
<p>
My world isn't always as solid as I'd like it to be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I want the Final Answers.</i><br>
<p>
Careful what you wish for. You might get it. And what would you do then?<br>
<p>
(I don't actually worry about these things, because my experience all my<br>
life has been that new questions follow hard on the heels of new answers,<br>
and I have no reason to expect that to change. It's right up there with<br>
expecting the sun to rise every day.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The burning search for that takes precedence</i><br>
<i>&gt;over everything else.  What can I do without the Truth?  How can I know</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I'm doing or why I should be doing it without the Truth?</i><br>
<p>
Depends on what you mean by "the Truth". I've been studying<br>
epistemology on and off as something of a hobby for a while, and<br>
by now I can come up with a number of different interpretations of<br>
what people might mean when they say "the Truth". But I'm not going<br>
to bore the list with an exercise in pointless sophistry.<br>
<p>
I don't think you do know what you're doing, entirely, and neither<br>
do I. Just because it's a good idea to constantly develop a better<br>
understanding of what we are actually doing doesn't mean that we can<br>
reasonably aspire to some Final Perfect State in which we will be utterly<br>
transparent to ourselves. Besides, being utterly transparent to myself<br>
doesn't really sound like all that much fun. How could I ever hope to<br>
surprise myself? But I don't worry about it, because *that* level of<br>
self-awareness just doesn't seem possible to me, given my understanding of<br>
how human brains work. If I switched to a new platform, though, this <br>
might become an open question again, but I'll cross that bridge when I<br>
come to it.<br>
<p>
I also think that the burning search for Final Answers does *not*<br>
take precedence over everything else, at least not all the time.<br>
When I have leisure is when I work on such things. At other times,<br>
what takes precedence over everything else is comforting a friend<br>
or finding a better job.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Doubting</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't just a hobby or even just a way of life.  It is an action taken</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a specific and most final goal in mind:  To Know everything that</i><br>
<i>&gt;matters.</i><br>
<p>
If you want to Know everything that matters, then first you need to know<br>
what matters. But I certainly hope you're not saying what you seem to be<br>
saying here: "give me omniscience or give me death". If I ever found myself<br>
in that unpleasant dilemma, I would slip out of it by choosing the third<br>
alternative: life.<br>
<p>
And lately I've grown suspicious of the practice of adorning big phrases<br>
like "way of life" with adverbial diminutives like "mere" or "just". You<br>
wonder why I get out of bed in the morning? I have found that it can be<br>
quite difficult to come up with a reason to get out of bed in the morning if<br>
I phrase the question as a philosophical puzzle, but I don't find it<br>
difficult at all to come up with a reason to get out of bed in the morning<br>
if I just put my mind to coming up with a reason. There are all kinds of<br>
good reasons to get out of bed in the morning. I must have come up with<br>
about ten thousand of them so far, so I don't see much reason to fear that<br>
I'll suddenly lose this ability.<br>
