<i>&gt; As I'm sure most of you have already realized, this technology suggests a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "quick and dirty" approach to transcending the "natural" human lifespan.</i><br>
<p>
I don't see anything of the sort.  In fact, I'm rather dismayed that<br>
the press is treating this cloning success as something interesting,<br>
when it's really nothing special or useful at all.  We already know<br>
exactly what the relationship between two genetically identical beings<br>
is: we've seen identincal twins for centuries.  Clones just happen to<br>
be identical twins of more different ages, so the "identity" issue is<br>
even more irrelevant there.  And a clone of yourself, while it might<br>
be nice to have a child with 100% of your genes instead of 50%, would<br>
probably die young after being infected with germs from you that have<br>
had 100s of generations to adapt to your--and therefore his--immune<br>
system.  That's probably why sexual reproduction is here in the first<br>
place (I find Ridley's arguent compelling).  The genetic mixing helps<br>
a long-generation organism keep ahead of the short-generation bugs.<br>
<p>
Why expend effort on genetic stagnation?<br>
