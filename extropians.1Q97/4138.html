No. <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;you think a brain is not a body?</i><br>
<p>
I am not my brain, that's just 4 LB's of gray goo, I am the information in my <br>
brain. If my brain is destroyed and there is no other copy of the information <br>
in it then I am destroyed too, that is the case  for all of us today. <br>
If however there were another copy of the information  that is me stored <br>
someplace else, then the destruction of my brain would not  be important.<br>

<p>
<i>        &gt;How do you define dead?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Irretrievable loss of information.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I can not.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I certainly can, a point. Maybe other things too, a quark, a photon,  <br>
an electron. Perhaps someday these things will be found to be made of even  <br>
smaller particles, perhaps not, as I said it's debatable.<br>
<p>

<p>
<i>        &gt;In your mind, where doe that exist?</i><br>
            <br>
In the same place arithmetic is located.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If a thing exists it has to exist somewhere.</i><br>
<p>
or everywhere.<br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;How could I destroy arithmetic?</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Do not allow it to be thought.</i><br>
<p>
I will give you $10,000  if you don't think about green giraffes for the  <br>
next 5 minutes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;What is the radius of an electron?</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A=A        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;if it exists in 3-D it has one.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I  do not have good enough eyes or a small enough ruler.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's real nice, but a do have a question,  <br>
What is the radius of an electron? <br>
I have a few more questions too. <br>
What is the sex of an electron?  <br>
What shade of color is an electron?  <br>
What does an electron taste like? <br>
What does an electron smell like?  <br>
Is an electron wet or dry? <br>
Is an electron happy or sad? <br>
What is the political party of an electron? <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Who says you are 100% aware of what you are thinking?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You say so. You're the one who said A=A, I am 100% aware of what I am <br>
100% aware.  Changes that are too small for me to be aware of are, <br>
well, too small for me to be aware of.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Size is relative.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Relative to what?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;if atoms have no individuality, the system would be unchanged. On         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;the other hand if as you say each atom is different then          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;exchanging atoms will  change the system. </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Does it have to noticably change the system?</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Yes. If I was a skillful surgeon I could exchange your right lung with your <br>
left lung and you'd still be OK because both parts are much the same. <br>
If I exchanged your right lung with your left kidney your system would change <br>
dramatically because the parts are very different and you would not be OK.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How many people argued about the shape of the earth?</i><br>
<p>
42.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It is possible to remove an electron from an atom right?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and make an ion, your point being ...<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;No, I am saying the probability of  finding 2 electron, or any         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Fermion, zero distance apart is zero.                   </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;"Same" logic, no two things at 0 distance.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
To repeat myself, that is NOT true. Two photons can be in the same place at <br>
the same time and not effect each other, otherwise everything would be a <br>
jumble, you couldn't see the moon or the stars or even the man sitting next <br>
to you.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Kind of strange to believe in a distance of 0 (even in </i><br>
<i>        &gt;millinanometers).                                        </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
You seem to be saying that someday we will find that in the real world two <br>
points can not be infinitely close together, it could be. If so then a line <br>
is made of a huge but not an infinite number of points, two points can only <br>
be in a finite number of positions. If so then Space-time is not continuous, <br>
it's digital,  and analog's last stand bites the dust.       <br>
