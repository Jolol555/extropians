Dr. Hugo de Garis:<br>
	In your article, you make the interesting note that boys outnumber<br>
girls 14 to 1 at SAT scores 700 and above.<br>
<p>
	Allow me to introduce myself.  I took the SAT at age 11, in seventh<br>
grade.  I scored a 670 Verbal, and 740 Math.  I came in second.  For the<br>
entire eight-state Midwest region.  To be more specific, the 670 was<br>
2nd, the 740 was 3rd, and the 1410 was 2nd.<br>
<p>
I'm a girl.<br>
<p>
Ha ha, just kidding - about the girl part, at least, though the SAT<br>
scores are simple and unvarnished fact.  But anyway:<br>
<p>
	Since apparently you regard SAT scores as measuring "genius", and<br>
speaking as one of your "geniuses" who cannot be matched by any mere<br>
female, let me speak frankly.  Dr. de Garis, you are a raving lunatic<br>
with no more chance of matching my SAT scores than you have of flying,<br>
regardless of how many Y chromosomes you happen to be born with.  For<br>
somebody working in Artificial Intelligence, you seem to be completely<br>
unaquainted with the methodology of cognitive science.  Anecdotes do not<br>
constitute adequate evidence for consigning half the human race to<br>
mental oblivion; you, on the other hand... <br>
<p>
Speaking as one of the very few people who know the sub-module of<br>
intelligence that the SAT *actually* measures, I know of no reason<br>
whatsoever why causal analysis should be a sex-linked trait.  If<br>
anything, females - living more frustrating lives thanks to the likes of<br>
you - should actually do *better* on the SAT.<br>
<p>
Why don't they?  I am reminded of an anecdote:<br>
<p>
Physics teacher:  "Why is this metal plate hottest on the side farthest<br>
from the heat source?"<br>
Student:  "Ehrm, because of the convection and such?"<br>
Teacher:  "No, because I just turned it around."<br>
<p>
In other words, I'd like to see some factual evidence before I start<br>
rationalizing.  Even if the ratios you cite are correct, it seems<br>
perfectly plausible to me that in this still-prejudiced society, 14<br>
times as many exceptional boys as girls are *recognized* and<br>
*encouraged*.<br>
<p>
Madame Curie could eat you for breakfast and so could I.  Don't presume<br>
to compare us, statistically, theoretically, or at all, until you can at<br>
least do it in a methodologically acceptable fashion.  The only remotely<br>
interesting argument on the entire page was your speculation about<br>
greater variance in males due to recessive X genes not being masked by<br>
another X gene.<br>
<p>
I resent being part of the statistics with which you casually dismiss an<br>
estimated 3 x 10^20 neurons that it would take you until Doomsday even<br>
to count.  Your Neanderthal attitude towards the female of the species<br>
is deeply offensive to me.  So is your total lack of self-knowledge in<br>
evolutionary terms.  As a young teenager, you channeled the<br>
rebelliousness designed to overthrow the current ruler of the tribe into<br>
feminism.  As an elder whose best evolutionary strategy lies in<br>
supporting the current ruler, you are a masculinist.  Either way, the<br>
horrid odor of self-righteousness wafts up as you write your smug way to<br>
Nazidom.<br>
<p>
There are others out there, ones who know how to use both apostrophes<br>
and rational arguments, arguing with the controlled experimental studies<br>
that are the language of science.  Some of them have established that<br>
average XXs are better at mentally rotating objects while average XYs<br>
are better at verbal skills.  And that is the *only* gender-based<br>
intelligence result that I have ever even heard of; I defy you to name a<br>
single female scientist - much less a majority - who now "just accept<br>
the idea of an inherent male genetically based superiority" on the basis<br>
of their results.<br>
<p>
I confess that I don't care, and certainly none of this is remotely<br>
relevant to the issue of the genius which obeys its own laws.  Speaking<br>
as a "genius" who knows *exactly* and *precisely*, in neurological and<br>
cognitive terms, what makes me a "genius", I can say that I don't see<br>
any reason why lightning wouldn't strike girls as often as boys.<br>
<p>
You don't often see women at conferences, you say?  (It came as no<br>
surprise whatsoever that you later applied exactly the same argument to<br>
blacks.)  I wonder what the average *age* of the speakers at conferences<br>
are?  I wonder how many XXs try to enter into Ph.D. programs... how many<br>
of them are driven out by people like you... and how many are subtly<br>
weeded out by male-designed tests.<br>
<p>
Let me share a secret with you.  A test designed by *any*<br>
socio-political-economic group, any group whatsoever, will weed out all<br>
those not of that group.  If the poor designed tests, they would weed<br>
out the rich.  It would come as absolutely no surprise whatsoever to<br>
find that the 14:1 SAT ratios you cite are being achieved on an SAT<br>
designed by a committee with 14 male members and 1 female member... or<br>
certainly one with a male committee chairman.<br>
<p>
It's all very well to place oneself at the apex of a hierarchy you<br>
design... until you wind up at the bottom of someone else's hierarchy. <br>
I am a member of an SAT-scoring group which damn well certainly excludes<br>
you, regardless of how many females happen to be in it.  I've decided to<br>
form a club of geniuses.  You, of course, are not invited.  It's not in<br>
your genetic destiny.  You'll never match a *real* genius, because I<br>
don't recall any *real* geniuses (think of exclusionary criteria...)<br>
with a Japanese email address!  Yes, virtually every invention I've ever<br>
heard of was designed by an American, and no genius *I've* ever heard of<br>
was Japanese.  In fact, although I happen to be making this statistic<br>
up, only 1 out of 14 top SAT scorers, in the Midwest, are Japanese.<br>
<p>
And, now that we've established my little ruling class, let's figure out<br>
what to do with you.  Now, when I was young, I used to believe that<br>
"non-geniuses" like you could be rehabilitated to my own cultural<br>
standards, although of course I regarded you with contempt because I<br>
could simulate your complete moral belief systems with 300 lines of<br>
code.<br>
<p>
Now that I'm a grizzled elder I've come to realize that that my own<br>
cultural standard is not merely superior but inherently exclusive;<br>
others don't join not because they're ungrateful or foolish or envious,<br>
they're simply not capable of meeting my standards.  So rather than<br>
being given an opportunity to join me in my self-evident superiority,<br>
you will be allowed to graciously sink to your natural level as a<br>
janitor.<br>
<p>
And of course, it goes without saying that no genius has ever carried<br>
the title of "Hugo de Garis", and only an infinitesimal fraction of the<br>
top SAT scorers.  It's fate.<br>
<p>
So... how do you like it, down on the bottom to which your way of<br>
thinking must inevitably condemn itself?  There's always someone<br>
smarter, faster, stronger.  "Might makes right" sounds fine and true,<br>
with "only my tribe is mighty" even more so, until someone like me<br>
happens along and squishes you like a bug.  You simply happen to be<br>
lucky that at my level of intelligence, the folly of Nazidom is<br>
obvious.  Otherwise, you *would* wind up as a janitor.  Are you willing<br>
to continue in your folly when *you* are at the bottom?<br>
<p>
Scientifically, ethically, and cognitively correct,<br>
Superior to you in every way,<br>
(At least by your standards),<br>
I am,<br>
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.<br>
<p>
Oh, and a postscript:  XXs are better at verbal skills, XYs are better<br>
at mental rotation, and not the opposite as was claimed above.  Out of<br>
curiosity, how far did you get in rationalizing why mental rotation<br>
wasn't important compared to verbal skills?<br>
