Hmm. Can you say "decontextualize"? What the hell, I can play<br>
recombinant memes.<br>
<p>
This is quoted from <a href="http://uhuru.net/tlksrc/9608/sources/teach13.htm">http://uhuru.net/tlksrc/9608/sources/teach13.htm</a>,<br>
which is just the first URL that popped up off of Altavista. I've seen<br>
better translations, but without the context of the Mahayana Buddhist<br>
tradition, none of the translations is going to make sense anyway.<br>
Remember that although in English it sounds like New Age gibberish, in<br>
the language that it's translated from, this stuff is technical jargon.<br>
<p>
1. To take across the numberless living beings<br>
2. To cut off the endless affliction<br>
3. To study the countless Dharma doors<br>
4. To realize the supreme Buddha Way<br>
<p>
I will add a few comments, though it's rather blasphemous of me to<br>
do so since I haven't taken these vows and thereby, by my own<br>
standards, am not a Mahayana Buddhist. "Dharma doors" generally<br>
seems to mean something like "aha" experiences or epiphanies, the<br>
really big "aha" experiences apparently being satori.  My understanding<br>
of these vows is that they represent the declaration of ambitions<br>
that are impossible to fulfill, or that will take eternity to<br>
fulfill. It seems to me that these are the right kinds of ambitions<br>
to have if one is serious about living forever.  Also, "to take<br>
across" is a technical term meaning to bring to full enlightenment;<br>
since the vow specifies the numberless living beings and not just<br>
the numberless sentient or sophontic beings, this could be interpreted<br>
as a Brinesque call for universal Uplift (except Buddhists don't<br>
necessarily oppose cryptography ;) or perhaps a Hansonian<br>
saving-the-world.  In any case, it's obvious that a person taking<br>
the above vows is not in any sense "stepping off" of any Wheels.<br>
<p>
If there are any real Buddhists on the list, and I'm making a hash of<br>
things here, please correct me. Thanks.<br>
<p>
The Buddhists that I like best tend to keep quiet about their religion,<br>
are good at having fun and appreciating stuff, tend to be studious, and<br>
like to party. I think that Joko Beck is my current favorite Buddhist<br>
writer, though the first thing any Zen book should tell you is that you<br>
can't get Zen out of a book.<br>
<p>
Once upon a time, religion was an off-limits topic on this list (because<br>
of the Great Witch War). Perhaps we should invoke this rule on some of<br>
Eliezer's posts.  ;)<br>
