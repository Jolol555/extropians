1) Quantum uploads<br>
<p>
What are the implications for mind uploading if some form of<br>
Q-mind theory is true? (e.g. the Penrose-Hameroff idea that<br>
mental states are the quantum states of entangled sets of<br>
neural microtubule electrons). As far as I can tell,<br>
uploading, copying, and so forth are all still possible,<br>
but there are all sorts of uniquely quantum-mechanical<br>
considerations.<br>
<p>
There is something called the No-Clone Theorem, which says <br>
that there is no device able to make a perfect copy of an <br>
*arbitrary* quantum state. However, there are ways to make <br>
copies of particular states, and there are universal copiers <br>
(only theoretical at this point) which only produce bounded errors.<br>
<p>
When I started thinking about this, I guessed that there would <br>
be two ways to copy a quantum state, a "classical" way and a <br>
"quantum" way. The classical way would be to measure the original, <br>
storing that information in some classical medium, and then<br>
reconstructing the quantum state in some new substrate by <br>
consulting the classical blueprint.  (The original need not be <br>
destroyed by this process, if "protective" or "non-demolition" <br>
measurements are possible.)<br>
<p>
The quantum way would avoid measurement and simply transfer the <br>
information via quantum interactions; an example would be quantum <br>
teleportation.<br>
<p>
Conveniently, Seth Lloyd has just put out a preprint <br>
("Quantum controllers for quantum systems, quant-ph/9703042)<br>
which defines exactly this distinction (he calls it<br>
semiclassical control vs quantum control). A quantum controller<br>
can extract information from one quantum system and pass it<br>
to another without disrupting the first.<br>
<p>
I suspect that all the discoveries being made in quantum <br>
computation, etc, will be very relevant to uploaders.<br>
The quant-ph archive at <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">http://xxx.lanl.gov</a> is the place<br>
where all the new announcements appear.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
2) Fast minds<br>
<p>
Long ago John Clark said that the first uploading would be an<br>
evolutionary divide, for reasons which everyone probably appreciates -<br>
an upload is expected by many to think orders of magnitude faster<br>
than a biological human.<br>
<p>
I've thought about this ever since, and so far I've thought of<br>
three ways in which a fast mind might come about.<br>
<p>
i) Emulation, i.e. uploading. Someone's brain is scanned and<br>
  emulated in a faster computational medium.<br>
<p>
ii) Acceleration. The human brain is made to function at greater<br>
  and greater speeds (for example, through introduction of<br>
  new nanostructures into neurons).<br>
<p>
iii) Invention. A "de novo" mind is created in a new medium,<br>
  rather than simply copied from the biological. This category<br>
  includes "invention" through digital evolution (genetic<br>
  algorithms, etc).<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the third path is the most likely - perhaps<br>
as a matter of market competition, and then natural selection,<br>
amongst Internet agent software. The third path could involve<br>
partial emulation, in the sense that neural architectures<br>
discovered in biological brains might be found useful and<br>
incorporated into software or hardware - but it seems unlikely<br>
to me that all the conditions necessary for human mind uploading<br>
will be met before there are "human-level" agents that have<br>
evolved online.<br>
