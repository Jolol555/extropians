<i> &gt;Haveing now spent several years in pursuit of a Ph.D. in political</i><br>
<i> &gt;economy, the following observation stands out to me as the most</i><br>
<i> &gt;puzzling:   Why do people seem so damn confident of their political</i><br>
<i> &gt;opinions?   </i><br>
<p>
Because the stakes are so high.<br>
<p>
There are only a few individuals out of the mass of society who<br>
are likely to use violence to mess my life up. There are the<br>
criminals, whom I rarely encounter and whom my friends and neighbors<br>
will readily help me oppose, and there are the government, whom I<br>
encounter on a daily basis and whom my friends and neighbors are<br>
afraid to oppose openly because they don't want to go to prison or<br>
get shot any more than I do.<br>
<p>
People are much more willing to use epistemic caution in debates where<br>
they aren't afraid that they have a lot to lose, if they lose. The only<br>
time I ever feel even *close* to the sensation that I am arguing for my<br>
life is when I'm in political arguments. I've worn handcuffs, I've had<br>
my room destroyed in a drug search (this was when I was very young),<br>
I've seen innocent young men and women shipped off to rot in prison.<br>
People do not argue calmly when they are arguing about the rights and<br>
responsibilities of the person who is holding a gun to their head, and<br>
that seems pretty straightforward to me.<br>
<p>
I find this a satisfying explanation of the phenomenon you pointed out,<br>
but now that you've pointed it out to me, I'm going to give some thought<br>
to changing my ways a bit. I don't promise that I'm going to change my<br>
ways, just that I'm going to give it some thought.<br>
