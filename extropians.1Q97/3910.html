In a message dated 97-03-24 00:02:26 EST, you write:<br>

&lt;&lt; <br>
 I tend to think that genius is largely genetic, too many great geniuses have<br>
<p>
 had pedestrian upbringing, but one of the great things about cloning is that<br>
<p>
 now we can know for sure. Clone Hawking, give the clone a good but not <br>
 extraordinary education, nothing better than that millions of people<br>
receive,  <br>
 if when the clone is 17 or 18  he knows more Physics than you do, then the <br>
 age old question will be decisively answered.<br>

Yes, Hawkins would be an interesting choice, after seeing his film ( which<br>
was dissapointing to me because the director chose to make it largely<br>
bigraphical istead of focusing on the theories) it is apparent that he comes<br>
from an eccentric, upper crust, English,  nerdy intellectual and elitist<br>
family. Raise him in the Ozarks on a pig farm and he might not be the same<br>
man at all. But i given a very stable home, good education and nourishment,<br>
the experiment might be qualified. Even if physics was not his study choice,<br>
perhaps he would be extraordinary at something, say an inventor, or an<br>
artist, or an engineer. Would the question be still 'decidely' answered?<br>
