I made the assertion that humans are operating at *far* below our true <br>
potential and that I believe a typical human has the potential to become a far <br>
greater genius than past geniuses, such as Newton.  Robin Hansen asked what <br>
evidence there is that we are operating so far beneath our potential.<br>
<p>
The geniuses themselves are the evidence that most of us are operating beneath <br>
our potential.  The people who excell show us some of what is possible.  I <br>
have no reason to assume that there is anything magically different about the <br>
geniuses that made them excell.  I think we all have the same basic equipment <br>
and that we can all take it to at least the same level of quality that the <br>
geniuses do.  I also believe that they could have taken their abilities much <br>
further than they did, especially if they had been working together with other <br>
geniuses, for that purpose.<br>
<p>
In the past few years, I have been working quite dilligently on creating <br>
genius within myself, with very significant results.  I learn skills and <br>
understand concepts much faster than I ever have; I am much more creative and <br>
inventive than I ever have been; the sheer quality of my thinking is beyond <br>
anything I have ever experienced.  I can trace my significant results directly <br>
to the personal discipline I have been developing within myself.  My genius <br>
was created consciously, by perseverence and a lot of hard work, not because <br>
I'm "gifted" (except maybe for the fact that I'm the type of person who would <br>
have the ambition and the belief that I could transform myself into a genius). <br>
 The point is that I had much more potential than I really imagined a few <br>
years ago, and much more potential than I had any evidence to support my <br>
belief in.<br>
<p>
There are certain types of activities and attitudes which promote the <br>
development of intelligence, activities which challenge the mind and attitudes <br>
which cause minds to always work to improve themselves in whatever ways they <br>
can.  Typical humans rarely engage themselves in highly challenging <br>
activities, and they are not generally encouraged or taught to develop the <br>
attitudes required for continual self-improvement.  Most people aren't really <br>
even *trying* to become smarter, especially since most people have the belief <br>
that their intelligence is set on a certain level.  Typical humans are not <br>
encouraged to think deeply or to regularly solve difficult and complex <br>
problems.  People are simply not doing the excercises required to develop <br>
genius.  This is why I believe they are far below their true potential. <br>
<p>
All the geniuses, such as Newton, DaVinci, Einstein, Feynman, and millions of <br>
others through the years, were not instant geniuses.  They spent many years <br>
excercising their minds, working on difficult problems, constantly refining <br>
their thinking.  It was this constant excercise that made them geniuses, not <br>
some special, magical quality.  Yes, there were some people that got started <br>
early, prodigies like Mozart, and what probably happened is that he became <br>
very fascinated, even obsessed, with certain types of thinking and with music <br>
at a very young age and his obsession caused him to learn very quickly.  This <br>
happens with many people, where they become obsessed with something and learn <br>
very quickly. Genius happens enough that I believe nearly all humans have the <br>
capacity to develop it, given a sufficiently strong determination and focus.  <br>
Getting someone to develop that determination and focus is something I'm not <br>
clear how to do, though.  At least not yet.<br>
