Interested in an open-ended lifespan, we have made a public <br>
announcement on the Cryonet inviting people to a new<br>
 organization called Metamorphosis Society and <br>
started its preliminary activities in Japan.<br>
<p>
The key messages transmitted are as follows:<br>
<p>
" We have to try our best to make our future in a <br>
good state. Those of you who could endeavor to make <br>
it good to the best of your ability come join us <br>
forming a cooperative network for it and take off to<br>
 the future. Our successors will take care of <br>
reanimating us in the way we want."<br>

The followings are subjects we talked about in <br>
February:<br>
<p>
 -The status quo of cryonics in Japan and Germany.<br>
 -Study on the feasibility of initial cool-down and <br>
perfusion in Japan<br>
 (The pre-treatment should be followed by packing <br>
the body in dry ice and<br>
 shipping it for the final cool-down and long-term <br>
storage in the U.S. It<br>
 is not too easy; it is necessary to make a speacial<br>
 effort to make it<br>
 happen.)<br>
 -How best we can spread the concept of the Society <br>
from now on.<br>
