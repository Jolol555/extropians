Interesting. The question is how to 1) make it target the cancer cells <br>
(the common cold virus doesn't care for (say) glial cells, so the carrier <br>
would not look for a glioma), 2) how to get it to infect all of them <br>
(otherwise the survivors would continue dividing, although the immune <br>
system would now be more likely to look for them if the others were <br>
dying) and 3) how to avoid making the changed cold virus spread (I'm not <br>
sure it would be healthy to have such a virus around, mutations happen <br>
all the time). <br>

Develop a way of perceiving the world that makes sense to you; people who<br>
feel connected to the world (be it through religion, marxism,<br>
transhumanism or plain emotion) live longer and healthier than people who<br>
feel disconnected from it. <br>
