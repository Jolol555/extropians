<i>&gt;        Natasha is absolutely correct when she says that "Our ideas are what</i><br>
<i>&gt;make us unique."  I don't think anyone on this list can challenge that</i><br>
<i>&gt;statement.  We all think differently, talk differently, walk differently,</i><br>
<i>&gt;act differently et cetera, and that is something to feel proud of.  </i><br>
<p>
Taking the bait, I responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Of course we can challenge that statement.  Unless "idea" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;broadened so far as to cover all human attributes, there are lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt;(combinations of) attributes that make us each unique.  Taken one by</i><br>
<i>&gt;one, most of the ideas we have are also shared by many other people,</i><br>
<i>&gt;just like our other attributes.  </i><br>
<p>
Shaun replied:<br>
<i>&gt;        Yes, you are correct to an extent.  However, although our</i><br>
<i>&gt;appearances are unique in some way or another, the process of physical</i><br>
<i>&gt;uniquity can be mapped.  The cells will replace themselves fully in X amount</i><br>
<i>&gt;of years.  However, with thoughts and ideas, the stream of consciousness is</i><br>
<i>&gt;totally unpredictable and wholly changable at any instant. </i><br>
<p>
Huh?  We most certainly can not change all our ideas at any instant.<br>
<p>
I also wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;I think the difference for you is that you value your ideas more than</i><br>
<i>&gt;your other attributes, so they define you more in your eyes.  And I</i><br>
<i>&gt;share that trait.  But I have sadly learned that most people simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;aren't like this - they define themselves much more in terms of</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-idea attributes.  So most of them just don't see "me", the me I</i><br>
<i>&gt;care about at least. </i><br>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Discerning persons would.  Why do you care about the opinions of </i><br>
<i>&gt;those who can't see beyond externalities--they're not worth wasting a </i><br>
<i>&gt;short life on.  Think of it as a screening device to find the truly </i><br>
<i>&gt;interesting people.</i><br>
<p>
Consider all the ways people define themselves which aren't in terms<br>
of ideas: physical appearance, health, temperment, personality,<br>
network of friends, hobbies, sports, abilities, status, profession, etc.<br>
Even academics who deal with idea for a living more often define<br>
themselves by their network of collegues, and their research ability. <br>
I discern lots of value in these people, and don't want to write them off.<br>
<p>
Mark Grant replied to Kathryn:<br>
<i>&gt;But eliminating them leaves a relatively small part of the population to</i><br>
<i>&gt;choose my friends from. I might well do better to spend some time giving</i><br>
<i>&gt;clues to the clueless... </i><br>
<p>
To which Kathryn replied:<br>
<i>&gt;I take it fairly seriously.  Friends support each other and provide a </i><br>
<i>&gt;haven from the stresses of the world.  It's not easy to find persons </i><br>
<i>&gt;that will truly accept you for who you are, not for who they want you to </i><br>
<i>&gt;be, and so I don't actively pursue having large numbers of friends, </i><br>
<i>&gt;preferring to enjoy the time spent with the wonderful ones I have found.  </i><br>
<p>
You might as well chide people for taking on jobs that aren't what<br>
they would do if they were independently wealthy.  Most of us aren't<br>
so wealthy in friend-attracting features that we can insist on friends<br>
who share most of their deepest values.  We're happy for you, but<br>
realize we may not all be as rich as you. <br>
<p>
A great deal gets said about inequality in this world, and how we<br>
aught to reduce it, but mostly its about monetary inequalities.  The<br>
largest inequalities I see around me are other: who is attractive, who<br>
is charasmatic, who is likeable, etc.  I'm not very sympathetic to<br>
attractive likeable people who demand that monetary inequalities<br>
be leveled, but who think of their kind of advantages as a natural right.<br>
