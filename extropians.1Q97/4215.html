<i>&gt; ["]with memories), not just regular cloning, then the copy is in fact just as</i><br>
<i>&gt; ["]much the original as was the original at the time of the copy.  Thus, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; ["]would be inaccurate to say it is "a child not yet born".  If you walk into a</i><br>

<i>&gt; ["]comes out of the side marked "the copy", will be no less the person who</i><br>
<i>&gt; ["]originally walked into the duplication chamber than the person who comes out</i><br>
<i>&gt; ["]of the side marked "the original".  It's not like a photo copying machine,</i><br>
<i>&gt; ["]where there is a 15% degradation in quality.  It is 100% the original.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; ["]think the question of "who's who" loses meaning in the debate.  The fact is</i><br>
<i>&gt; ["]you slit into two pieces (seemingly).</i><br>
<i>&gt; ["]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree entirely. If however, you clone a body and not the mind, then the</i><br>
<i>&gt; clone should be treated as a new person, with no accountability at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time of its creation.</i><br>
<p>
We are talking about a technique that is not cloning but production of<br>
human analogs, much like bringing your duplicate here from a parallel<br>
universe. In the case of analogs, property rights as well as personal<br>
responsibility are indeed shared. Imagine someone killing someone then<br>
making 10 duplicates of himself. Pleading guilty gets him 20 years, with<br>
parole at 8 years, yet with shared responsibility, the 8 years are<br>
divided among 10 analogs (plus the original, who may even into hiding)<br>
so they each serve 9.6 months before getting out on good behavior. Since<br>
they would be sentenced at the same time, they would most likely serve<br>
at the same prison, and would hang together, so they wouldn't have to<br>
worry about bending over for the soap.<br>
<p>
IF the individual is sufficiently wealthy, as long as they don't mind<br>
diluting their wealth by the number of analogs produced, and can escape<br>
wrongful death lawsuits, this would be a useful option.<br>
