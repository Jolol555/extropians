Bigger question: how do you tell if any memory is real or not? The best<br>
you can do is to ask someone else who was there, but if it's subjective<br>
then you have no proof at all. 'Deja vu', for example, seems to me to be<br>
just a memory error. <br>

But can't we have both? I know that traditionally smart people aren't<br>
supposed to be particularly attractive and vice-versa, but attraction<br>
seems to be as much of a learned ability as mathematics, so I'm not sure<br>
that we have to give up one for the other. Do the Greek god archetypes<br>
exist because those are the kind of people we can be, or do the kind of<br>
people we are exist because of the archetypes we believe in?<br>
