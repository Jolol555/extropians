The Low Willow and Tony Csoka asked for explanation of the <br>
statement <br>
<p>
: Extropiansism, BTW, amounts to the same thing as secular Judaism.  <br>
<p>
I think I overstated my case.  To say that Extropianism "amounts to the <br>
same thing as" secular Judaism is an oversimplification.  <br>
<p>
To discuss this adequately, I would have to survey the whole memetic <br>
landscape, and show how Extropianism fits into it.  I would have to <br>
explain what Judaism is, in memetic terms; how secular Judaism serves <br>
its parent meme; and how Extropianism budded off as a new mutant <br>
form of the secular Judaism meme.  I started laying the groundwork  <br>
for this in the "memes (propagationsism)" thread on the old list.  <br>
There is more to this than can be even touched on in one post.  I'm just <br>
going to focus on one point.  <br>
<p>
The basic Extropian vision, as I understand it, is that the whole world <br>
will be mechanized, the new transhuman species will emerge, and <br>
transhumankind will expand througout space; and meanwhile the state <br>
will wither away.  <br>
<p>
This is exactly comparable to the founding vision of the Soviet Union.  <br>
Marx and the Bolsheviks weren't trying to establish a totalitarian state <br>
as an end in itself; the state was supposed to be a temporary thing that <br>
would eventually render itself uncessary, and wither away.  Meanwhile <br>
the whole world would be mechanized, and the New Communist Man <br>
would emerge.  Space colonization wasn't part of the original vision, <br>
but it was implicit;  by the 1950s, the Russians were attempting <br>
space colonization as a national project.  I remember the day they <br>
launched their first satellite (Sputnik).  I was eleven.  It caused an <br>
immense sensation, almost like an announcement of contact with aliens.  <br>
In America, space was science fiction.  And then all of a sudden, one <br>
morning the radio announcer said:   the Russians are in space!  <br>
<p>
Of course, they didn't get very far with this.  The Soviet economic <br>
experiment was a collosal failure.  Ironically, the state did wither away, <br>
leaving near-anarchy in its wake.  But the communists did *attempt* to <br>
mechanize the world, transform themselves, and colonize space.   <br>
<p>
The vision of a transhuman condition goes all the way back to Isaiah. <br>
<p>
!   Never again will there be in it [the new Jerusalem] <br>
!   an infant who lives but a few days, <br>
!   or an old man who does not live out his years; <br>
!   he who dies at a hundred <br>
!   will be thought a mere youth; <br>
!   he who fails to reach a hundred <br>
!   will be considered accursed. <br>
<p>
The Bolsheviks were the first who had enough hubris to treat this as a <br>
practicable vision, something that could be made to actually happen.  <br>
(Hubris has always been permitted; it's just that it has consequences.)<br>
<p>
Now, Extropians also want to make it actually, physically happen, but <br>
they want to do it within the capitalist economy.  Instead of Karl Marx, <br>
their mentors are Robert Heinlein, Ayn Rand, Marvin Minsky, Vernor <br>
Vinge, Michael Shermer, etc.  <br>
<p>
I don't know if the connection between secular Judaism and <br>
Bolshevism is self-evident.  I'm curious:  what do they teach you <br>
about the Soviet Union in today's schools?  Is the Russian Revolution <br>
part of the history curriculum?  -- at what level of detail?  Is "Socialist <br>
Realism" a concept you would encounter in an English class, or <br>
any class?  Or do you have to find out about such things on your own?  <br>
