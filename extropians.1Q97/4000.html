In a message dated 97-03-25 06:24:51 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 &lt;&lt; If you ask how many people whose opinions--in the absence of any<br>
  direct experience of mine--I value so highly that I might actually<br>
  re-examine my own ideas in light of their disagreement, then yes,<br>
  there are very few of those indeed.  I see absolutely no reason<br>
  why I should give any creedence at all to J. Random Ph.D. or<br>
  John Q. Bestseller. <br>
<i>   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree with the first half of this - opinions that I value are hard to find,<br>
 indeed!<br>
But as to questioning my own beliefs, I do it often and with each new piece<br>
of information that I find.  ad I not been of that mind I would never have<br>
been able to find Extropian philosophy. <br>
Also, I do not like the emotional tone of sarcasm in reference to Ph.D.'s or<br>
successful authors. I like to support the successes of other people who<br>
excell, not put them down for being rewarded for it, in money or fame.<br>
