<p>
I don't know about you but my computer has long since lost price signals<br>
and its total recall computational information flow has increased 10,000<br>
fold and is lean. Does any one else have this experience? Let's alleviate<br>
our talk so as to NOT perilously expose the dirty laundry, [we all know...]<br>
hidden behind the "ruling class" price system. Remember, this is a family<br>
list and we should both agree there are truths the mundanes' need memetic<br>
conditioning in before learning.<br>

It ain't over till the fat metazoan sings!!!<br>
