<i>&gt; If you want to want something else, then how can it be that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; wanted it in the first place?</i><br>
<p>
I don't see anything odd about wanting to change what you want;<br>
it's a form of wanting to change yourself. You might decide that<br>
you'd be better off without a certain desire (e.g. you want to<br>
smoke, but you also want to live forever); you might want to <br>
experience new things, and find that some of your existing<br>
wants keep you in place; and there are probably other ways this<br>
can happen.<br>
