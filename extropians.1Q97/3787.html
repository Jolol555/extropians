<i>&gt; All civilized societies also recognize common concepts of intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; property, notably concepts like the patent, copyright, and trademarks.</i><br>
<p>
This is manifestly false, unless your definition of "civilization"<br>
includes it, in which case it is tautological.  China, Pakistan, and<br>
several other countries have no such concepts, and no need of them.<br>
The United States had no such laws before the USPTO was created.<br>
The very concept itself is a denial of the individual rights you<br>
seek to protect: an individual who has acquired some knowledge by<br>
legal non-coercive means has the right to use whatever knowledge he<br>
has to further his life's goals without coercive interference from<br>
the state on behalf of some other claimant to a monopoly on that<br>
knowledge.  Patents and Copyrights are coercive monopolies, not<br>
properties (trademarks, in contrast, /are/ properties because their<br>
use by non-owners constitutes making a fraudulent substantive claim).<br>
<p>
The policies you advocate here are no more justified than any other <br>
government interference, and what's worse, they give a justification<br>
that sounds libertarian in principle while stabbing true liberty in<br>
the back.  Those who wish to protect their intellectual discoveries<br>
must do so themselves with contracts, technologies, and other non-<br>
coercive means, not beg the state to do it for them at gunpoint.<br>
