Cool, I'm posting.  I wonder if I should be surprised by the total lack<br>
of discussion (unless I'm forgetting something) of Frank Sulloway's work<br>
on this or the transhuman lists.  I just read a review and interview in<br>
_Skeptic_* last night and it seemed cool all over again.  I'd like to<br>
read the book myself soon.  But one thing in the interview struck me:<br>
<p>
*Volume 4 # 4 1996.  <br>
<p>
Sulloway claimed that based on birth order, class, etc. Darwin would be<br>
94+-6% likely to support a radical idea like evolution by natural<br>
selection.  Assuming his numbers were accurate, that would leave at most<br>
12% influence for genetic *and* uncontrolled environmental factors.<br>
<p>
If his model is at all in the right ball park, the "nature vs. nurture"<br>
debate may just have been resolved, at least for certain personality and<br>
"emotional intelligence" traits.  If you can have that kind of<br>
predictive accuracy based on environmental factors alone, I think<br>
'nurture' trumps 'nature'.  Of course this would hit the "cloning"<br>
brou-ha-ha as well.  (SJ Mercury's forum is going downhill.)  So many<br>
reviews of Sulloway's work, so little mention of the implications, at<br>
least that I've seen.  <br>
<p>
Another point was the idea that France resisted Darwinism for longer<br>
because it had already shifted to smaller families == fewer 'liberal'<br>
laterborns to 'conservative' firstborns.  The rest of the West has<br>
caught up, and may be becoming more conservative as a result.  Oddly<br>
enough, if China keeps up "one child" it may become relatively more<br>
radical, as only children apparently are less constrained.  (Yay!  Guess<br>
what I am.)<br>
<p>
Hmm.  Polygamous societies would be conservative -- lots of firstborns<br>
(one per wife.)  Stable populations of high-tech mortals -- us -- are<br>
conservative, with about one firstborn per laterborn.  Immortal, slowly<br>
growing populations could retain looseness even if the adults themselves<br>
didn't, through the only children.<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>
