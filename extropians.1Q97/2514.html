<p>
A bit like what happens in _Permutation City_, but remember what Durham<br>
did. If I was convinced of the validity of the "Egan gambit" (for example,<br>
by trying out something like Durhams serial experiments during my life as<br>
Trans-Anders) and platonic materialism, I would accept the "No Clone<br>
Theorem" and say that as long as the emulation and I were identical, we<br>
were the *same* (in an ontological sense) being (in addition, I have as<br>
you already know a somewhat fluid view of 'self'), so terminating my<br>
existence as Big Crunch-Anders in favor of an existence as Dyson-Anders<br>
would not be a problem. Essentially this scenario mirrors the various<br>
discussions about uploading and identity, and the answer depends on your<br>
view of the relation between you and your identical copies. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of the various schemes for literal immortality that I've heard of,</i><br>

<i>&gt; a close second, Tipler third, and Moravec/Egan fourth. </i><br>
<p>
IMHO we haven't any support yet for the Linde scenario except for the<br>
black hole sensitivity; I would be more convinced about it if we knew baby<br>
or basement universes did exist. Dyson is reasonable and much in<br>
accordance to known physics, but requires a bit of an update to take<br>
reversible computing into account. Tipler seems to be heading more for<br>
metaphysics than physics, but his scenario may still be saved and<br>
extended. Moravec/Egan is as yet untestable (except through the dynamite<br>
headband method), but might become more reasonable once we are uploaded... <br>
