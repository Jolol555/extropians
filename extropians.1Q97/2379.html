At &lt;URL: <a href="http://jya.com/qshake.htm">http://jya.com/qshake.htm</a> &gt; is a reprint of the article by<br>
cryptographer Giles Brassard from the Jan 31 1997 issue of Science<br>
about Grover's quantum search algorithm we have discussed here recently<br>
and its application to crypto.<br>
<p>
Here is an excerpt, describing how it could be used to find an entry in<br>
a directory of names and phone numbers which matches a given phone number:<br>
<p>
   To solve the database search problem, Grover starts by setting a<br>
   quantum register to a superposition of all possible names in the<br>
   phone directory. A single access to the database (which may involve a<br>
   computation if it is virtual) creates a superposition of all possible<br>
   pairs of matching names and phone numbers. The resulting quantum state<br>
   contains the desired pair, but with vanishingly small amplitude -- the<br>
   measure of how much it contributes to the global state -- compared to<br>
   the multitude of unwanted pairs. If the register were observed at that<br>
   point, the odds of obtaining the relevant answer would be as small as<br>
   if an arbitrary name had been tried at random by a classical computer.<br>
<p>
   Grover's discovery is a clever sequence of simple operations on the<br>
   register's state. This process can be thought of as a sort of "quantum<br>
   shake," which, contrary to a classical shake, brings order rather than<br>
   disorder. Just as crests reinforce each other when ripples meet in water,<br>
   Grover's shake uses quantum interference effects to increase the amplitude<br>
   of the pair that contains the target phone number at the expense of<br>
   all other pairs. This increase is so subtle that the probability of<br>
   obtaining the desired result by observing the quantum register after<br>
   a single shake is almost as small as before. However, the shake can be<br>
   repeated over and over again, gradually boosting the amplitude of the<br>
   correct answer to a detectable level. Provided the solution is unique,<br>
   it is found with near certainty if the quantum register is observed after<br>
   (pi/4)N1/2 shakes, where N is the size of the database.<br>
<p>
   To use an analogy from Kristen Fuchs, Grover's quantum searching<br>
   technique is like cooking a souffle. You put the state obtained by<br>
   quantum parallelism in a "quantum oven" and let the desired answer<br>
   rise slowly. Success is almost guaranteed if you open the oven at<br>
   just the right time. But the souffle is very likely to fall -- the<br>
   amplitude of the correct answer drops to zero -- if you open the oven<br>
   too early. Furthermore, the souffle could burn if you overcook it:<br>
   strangely, the amplitude of the desired state starts shrinking after<br>
   reaching its maximum. After twice the optimal number of shakes,<br>
   you are no more likely to succeed than before the first shake.<br>
<p>
It does not go into more detail about Grover's algorithm than this but<br>
I thought that was a nice bit of imagery.  Who knows what the quantum<br>
theorists will cook up next?<br>
