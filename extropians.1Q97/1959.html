Chris, the project to which you refer is an attempt to recognize<br>
that the speech that many people in Oakland grow up speaking is a<br>
creole with roots mainly in English but also showing some traits<br>
that have been traced to West African languages. The project is<br>
one to teach English teachers these "foreign" linguistic structures,<br>
in order to enable them to better teach *standard* English to their<br>
students. Even the original resolution of the Oakland school board<br>
makes this last point clear, before they reworded it to meet the<br>
public attacks.  Now the point is even clearer, but no one is<br>
bothering to read their actual resolution, preferring to satisfy<br>
themselves with what Rush Limbaugh has to say about the resolution.<br>
<p>
Now, of course it's an open question whether or not the speech of<br>
most black people in Oakland is merely a dialect of English or a<br>
creole containing elements from non-English languages, but it seems<br>
to me that open questions should be worked on both sides, and the<br>
"creole" answer is the one that the Oakland school board decided<br>
to work with. But it is ignorant to claim that the school board has<br>
expressed any desire to teach their students any form of English other<br>
than standard literary English.<br>
<p>
Of course, if we had school choice instead of one-size-fits-all<br>
publicly funded and state monopolized education, this would be no<br>
more a matter of concern than whether or not the local grocery<br>
chain chooses to carry DHEA or not. Separation of school and state<br>
is the real issue here.<br>
<p>
Next time, you might want to try reading the resolution you are<br>
attacking before repeating what you read in the newspaper and see<br>
on TV.<br>
