I get you.  Yes, the types of hardware used are irrelevant - it might<br>
even be found expedient to use some sort of genetically engineered<br>
brain-like substance!  I just wanted to clarify (more for myself than<br>
anyone else) that*some* implementation of R-complex and limbic<br>
*functions* would be necessary for fully human experience as an<br>
uploaded entity.  And I see what you mean in that it would make an ideal<br>
first base camp for AI, being relatively less complex than neocortical<br>
functions, therefore easier to implement.<br>
<p>
Ramble:- That sets me thinking: 'fully human'.  Yes, I suppose one would<br>
have to start off like that, to make it easier to 'get one's bearings',<br>
so to speak.  But later on, the fact that you could turn sub-routines on<br>
and off at will: how would that affect your psychology?  Take pain: it's<br>
a warning sign.  People who don't feel pain die an early death, it seems.<br>
There would be a strong temptation for the uploaded to switch off pain<br>
circuitry quite a lot of the time.  Would that make you more of a risk<br>
taker, or be likely to expose you to more risk?<br>
<p>
e.g., would your self-monitoring then be like in a strategy game like<br>
Command &amp; Conquer, where all you are presented with is information on<br>
the state of battle, and the condition of your forces, but you don't<br>
'feel' anything?<br>
<p>
(Interestingly, some games people are talking about having more<br>
'feedback' in games- resistance from joysticks, mild shocks when <br>
you're hit, etc.)<br>
<p>
Hmm, interesting.<br>
