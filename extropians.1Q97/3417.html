The idea of silicon and your comments regarding its properties have shown<br>
that there are certain specific issues to consider if silicon and silicone<br>
are to be used. You have also suggested on the "Physics" thread an<br>
alternative that I rather like.<br>
<p>
Disagreeing with concepts can only propel new ways of thinking and new<br>
ideas, if the reasons for disagreeing are substantive. The insult was not to<br>
me, but to the opportunity of expanding our creative thinking. This is my<br>
reason for bringing that aspect of the project to this forum. If I present<br>
an idea, I must be open to objections, disagreements, and creative<br>
insightful opinions. The final decision will be my own.<br>
<p>
This thread has only continued my thinking about how the new transhuman<br>
images might look. There is no doubt that they will be at a mid-transhuman<br>
stage. Early transhuman is now and I wouldn't want to spend time trying to<br>
depict the "fight or flight" aspect of our emotions.  Rather, the<br>
mid-transhuman will have certainly expanded to the refined emotional stage<br>
and still have some sort of "body" with which to travel.<br>
