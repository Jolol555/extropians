Anyone who becomes so famous that they are recognized by the populace would<br>
indicate that populace knew what extropy means. If the populace knows what<br>
extropy means, then its authenticity would also be recognized. <br>

Con-artists (no pun intended -:) are masters at what they do in all trades.<br>
It's unfortunate, but, "shit happens."<br>

Sorry, I should have been more specific. Artwork can challenge the<br>
suppositions of group or class of people. I'll give two examples: Robert<br>
Maplethorp challenged basic assumptions about sexuality as well as same-sex<br>
relationships. He challenged the general view of the sexual masculine as<br>
something ugly and horrible and made it beautiful and elegant. Ophra Winfry<br>
in her creative endeavors has become the most powerful woman in Hollywood,<br>
challenging assumptions about being black and how fast one can customarily<br>
rise to the top. The Empire States Building challenged an assumption about<br>
how tall and sturdy a building could be.  VR challenged the assumptions that<br>
we are limited to one reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I give a short</i><br>
<i>&gt;description they assume it's a fringe group of nuts.  I tried that</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiment once.</i><br>
<p>
Try another delivery.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I still doubt the mass viability of Extropianism in a world with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;tenuous grasp of the Enlightenment.</i><br>
<p>
That's one way of looking at things.<br>
