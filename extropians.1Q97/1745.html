Omega:<br>
<i>&gt;In a more general sense, one might say that at present, technological </i><br>
<i>&gt;change drives social change far more than social change drives any</i><br>
<i>&gt;form of technological change.</i><br>
<p>
And yet, to prove such a precise statement, we would have to utilize <br>
historical evidence, and we would probably have to insert an economic <br>
element.  In my earlier list of books, I totally forgot <br>
to mention Peter Drucker's _Age of Discontinuities_.  Drucker makes a <br>
good case for a pattern of technology driving economic change, and <br>
that economic change in turn effecting society.  He published it in <br>
1969 but did predict many of the characteristics of our present-day <br>
economy, which he called the "knowledge economy".<br>
