I would appreciate any thoughts you might have on this.  I would say this<br>
is my best poem yet.  Of course, this indicates two things, I don't write<br>
much poetry and I don't write it very well.  Oh well, I'm working on it.<br>

                                                            Dreams and<br>
Dictators<br>
<p>
<p>
Living a lie from week to week,<br>
Reinforced by those who tell them to be meak,<br>
So that when after they die,<br>
Everything under the sky <br>
Will belong to them.<br>
<p>
A humble dream indeed!<br>
But it does not address my need.<br>
I desire a world I can call my own.<br>
I want knowledge and power beyond what mortals have known.<br>
I want to live forever on earth.<br>
<p>
Then they tell me it is a foolish dream,<br>
But they are not what they seem.<br>
Hypocrites all, they go and pray,<br>
But they are back to living for earth when comes Monday.<br>
I am not of there ilk.<br>
<p>
My dreams are for the future, yes, <br>
But they do not include my death.<br>
For with the perfection of the nanite,<br>
Comes the future in-finite,<br>
Where sharing by none will mean plenty for all.<br>
<p>
For this they would pity me.<br>
I do not want the deluded one's sympathy.<br>
All I would ask is that you not dictate<br>
What you perceive to be the almighty's mandate.<br>
To those that dream without constraint.<br>
