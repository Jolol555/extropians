<p>
I am not sure the lookup table business can be disposed of thus easily. <br>
If we consider the lookup table to define a discrete Hamiltonian over <br>
entire system state space, it obviously describes a physical system <br>
exhaustively, its entire dynamics. Since a human is a physical system, a <br>
lookup table can certainly describe his evolution. The answer lies in the <br>
size of the table -- it is superastronomic (not enough matter in the <br>
universe to construct anything interesting). That a lookup table <br>
intuitively cannot be intelligent is an artefact of our intuition, having <br>
about the same relevance as that against Searle's chinese room gedanken <br>
experiment, imo.<br>
