<i>&gt;&gt;Steve, Soros' comments are totally and utterly self-serving. Don't be</i><br>
fooled!  He is doing what people who get to the top have always done:<br>
trying to stay there by toadying to government.  Exactly the same things<br>
were said by political businessmen towards the end of the 19th century,<br>
and the support they gave to the concept of big government led to the<br>
wonderful results we've had for most of this century.<br>
<p>
This is the voice of mercantilism, not capitalism.  Given that<br>
literature reflects opinion, just look at the very first thing he says,<br>
then go to any bookshop in town and count the number of books, popular<br>
and academic, that support laissez faire, then count the number of books<br>
that support intervention.  Get the picture? <br>
<p>
He is, quite simply, lying through his teeth.  Why?  He wants to make<br>
the state more powerful because, being rich, he is in a position to<br>
influence a powerful state to do things to his advantage, to make him<br>
richer.  It doesn't matter a damn to him what ideology the state upholds<br>
- socialism, fascism, it's all the same, just so long as the state<br>
becomes  a more powerful instrument *in itself*. If the USA were even<br>
more fascist than it is he would be singing a fascist song and<br>
critiquing laissez faire from a fascist (e.g. nationalistic) point of<br>
view and you wouldn't hear a peep about the poor and the disadvantaged.<br>
As it is, the present flavour is towards the left, so he falls in with<br>
that.<br>
<p>
You can bet your bottom dollar there wouldn't be very much re-distribution<br>
of *his* money going on!<br>
<p>
Sorry if this is a bit of a rant, but I was just shocked by the utter<br>
cynical evil of what he was saying, and saddened by how you seemed to be<br>
taken in.<br>

Sorry, George, I just don't buy your rant, if that's what it is.  The<br>
present flavour (British spelling, interesting)  is toward the LEFT???  What<br>
century are you coming from?  The last election saw two Replublicans running<br>
against each other, with Clinton making speeches that could have come from<br>
Ronald Reagan.  <br>
<p>
And, in fact, Soros has redistributed a lot of his own money, mostly in sort<br>
of a one man Marshall plan for Eastern Europe.  For a capitalist, he's not<br>
such a bad guy.<br>
