This is all good and well, ASSUMING, that you are using radar sensing<br>
technology.  However, current state-of-the-art ballistic missile defense<br>
sensors for coast, reentry, and terminal phases *do not* use radar<br>
technology.  The current technology is also extremely capable of<br>
discriminating between dummy warheads and live ones.  The sensor technology<br>
has an effective exoatmospheric (e.g. lunar) sensing range of thousands of<br>
miles.  <br>
<p>
Taking this into consideration, I would say the odds of a viable defense<br>
aren't so slim anymore.  <br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Given our 10 kiloton clean ferrous warhead (weighing one ton), we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; could decimate the world with 110,000 one ton ferrous rocks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But this is the problem. I don't believe your figures, and still haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt;had time to find an official 'J to MT' conversion rate. The two figures I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have handy are that the explosion speed of TNT is about 5500m/s and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;something like 50g of antimatter is equivalent to 1MT. So that would give</i><br>
<i>&gt;figures of 0.5*5500*5500 = 1.5x10^7 or 0.1 * c^2 / 10^9 = 9x10^6 J per kg</i><br>
<i>&gt;of TNT. So let's say 10^7 J/kg. </i><br>
<p>
According to ASTM E-380-82 of Standards for Metric Practice, one ton TNT<br>
nuclear equivalent is 4.184^9 Joules.  This number is not the amount of<br>
energy in a ton of TNT (which, BTW detonates at ~7000m/s in most military<br>
forms), but a standardized unit with a historical name.  In fact, one ton<br>
TNT nuclear equivalent is defined as exactly 10^9 calories.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Freefall velocity from the moon is around 11km/s, so a minimum energy</i><br>
<i>&gt;launch will give you 500 * 11000 * 11000 = 6 * 10^10 J. That's</i><br>
<i>&gt;equivalent to about 6 * 10^3 kg of TNT, or 6 tons. Hence, a thousand times</i><br>
<i>&gt;less than you claim. Sure you haven't got tons and kg confused? </i><br>
<p>
A one ton ferrous rock is pretty small.  In fact, it amounts to a boulder<br>
roughly 0.5-0.7 meters in diameter.  Therefore, it is not surprising that it<br>
only has an energy yield of 6*10^10 Joules.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Even if that's true, you now have to increase the figure to 6,000,000, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;your total to 110,000,000. In my earlier message I showed that you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;launch 18,000 before forces arrive from Earth. Note, of course, that if my</i><br>
<i>&gt;warheads can't target you at 6km/s, then your rocks will certainly not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to target me at 11km/s, and decimating the military will still leave</i><br>
<i>&gt;90% of them just itching to wipe you out. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The fundamental problem is this: launching rocks from the moon gives you</i><br>
<i>&gt;around a factor of four increase in energy from gravity. So you can put</i><br>
<i>&gt;four times as much energy into Earth as you can generate. In order to hit</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Earth with 60 MT worth of rocks you need to generate 15 MT equivalent</i><br>
<i>&gt;of energy. That's 15 * 10^7 * 10^9 J. With a 1GW reactor to power your</i><br>
<i>&gt;100% efficient mass-driver that will take you about five years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;'Decimating the planet' with 1,100 MT will be impossible, because you'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;need a century to launch that many rocks, in which time the population</i><br>
<i>&gt;would have increased by a factor of four. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Your assertion that a 1 ton rock falling from lunar space to earth would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; only impact with 10 tons of force is also completely laughable. You've</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; obviously never taken a physics course.</i><br>
<p>
Check your math and your units.<br>
<p>
Your 10 tons of force figure is even more laughable since "tons" are not a<br>
unit of force.  As for nuclear equivalence, 1-ton falling rock =<br>
0.01-kiloton nuclear yield = 10 tons of TNT nuclear equivalence (which are<br>
units of energy).  To get into energies at the bottom of the nuclear range<br>
you would need a rock the size of a building.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Actually, I have a degree in the subject, which is why your figures looked</i><br>
<i>&gt;dubious and I checked them rather than taking them at face value. My</i><br>
<i>&gt;calculations are publically available above; please either prove me wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;or stop claiming that you're right. The whole problem with your scenario</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that your calculations are out by a factor of 1000, which invalidates</i><br>
<i>&gt;the whole scheme. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Force equals mass times</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; acceleration ( for which (end velocity^2)/2 can be substituted). Using</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; gravity, a 1 ton rock accelerates at an average of .5 G for over 150,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; miles (assuming a negligible velocity near the L1 point where Earth and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; lunar gravity forces are equal). Falling falling falling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And if you do the integration the answer is around 11km/s. As I used in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the calculations above. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Just some quick comments on nuclear effects in the lunar environment:<br>
<p>
I checked all my civil engineering books and others to get real figures and<br>
data.  Assume a nuclear device with a yield of 1-Mt, which is a a few times<br>
higher than the actual average yield of the current arsenal.  An airburst<br>
would have virtually no effect in the lunar environment, so we will assume a<br>
ground burst.  Assuming a theoretically perfect energy yield for a 1Mt<br>
device, we have a total output of ~4*10^15 Joules.  However, the vast<br>
majority of the energy is harmlessly radiated, since an atmosphere and<br>
surface living is required for these effects to have significance.  The only<br>
significant destructive force is the ground shock.  Note that much of the<br>
ground shock energy found in atmospheric environments is airslap induced<br>
ground shock, and is therefore irrelevant.  I assumed a depth of 2-meters,<br>
since soil arching plays a significant role in shock resistance.  After much<br>
nasty calculation based on the above values, you will be disappointed to<br>
learn that the safe distance from ground zero is between 500-1000 meters for<br>
a 1Mt surface burst, depending on soil conditions.  The reason is apparently<br>
that virtually all the blast and cratering effects are consequences of<br>
having an atmosphere, and soil doesn't propagate shock waves very well.  In<br>
fact, structures specifically hardened against nuclear blasts could survive<br>
quite near ground zero, since non-airslap induced ground shock is attenuated<br>
extremely rapidly.<br>
<p>
Note that this is not an exact science, and that there are many factors<br>
involved.  I was simply demonstrating that nuclear weapons lose most of<br>
their effectiveness in subterranean lunar environments.  Nuclear weapons are<br>
hundreds of times more effective on earth.<br>
