<p>
Sorry, not true. Its all how you apply it. There is  minimum, but how<br>
and when you apply it, but, as NASA has learned with their gavity assist<br>
maneuvers, as well as BMDO with Clementine, minimum energy maneuvers are<br>
extremely efficient. They just take a long time.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; &gt; You could even have small mass</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; propell asteroids from the main belt toward earth, and use less than .1%</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
No, its all realitive to the amount of mass you are using in each<br>
pellet, and the final velocity you need. The lunar mass driver designed<br>
by O'Niel was long enough for people to ride comfortably, with maximum<br>
Gs of less than 9. It was over 75 km long. Hell, thats big enough for<br>
use on Earth to cover 40-60% of launch energy.<br>
<p>
Firing small pellets at extremely high velocities (1000G accelerations)<br>
is easy with fairly small drivers. I've built a hand held mass driver<br>
that fired a copper wire slug through an 8" concrete wall. The<br>
capacitors for it took an oxy/acet. cart to lug around. The gauss<br>
evaporated the copper into a plasma and propelled it across the room. As<br>
it passed through the air, the copper cooled into pellets with a LOT of<br>
energy. Major FUN.<br>
<p>
You're<br>
<i>&gt; changing your scenario again; if you'd originally said that an asteroid</i><br>
<i>&gt; belt society (if such a thing is possible) could defend itself against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth this way then I would probably have agreed. They'd be hard to find,</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard to hit, and able to cause a lot of damage to Earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the long-run, planets really are a bad place to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
True in a tactical sense, however there are bad places to be and REALLY<br>
bad places to be. Earth is in the latter category, while luna is not so<br>
bad. Don't forget however the childcare problems with low G<br>
environments. You'll have kids with next to no bone or muscle mass,<br>
probalby anemic cardiac systems, etc. unless you take a decent asteroid,<br>
hollow it out, and spin it like Niven's Belters did.<br>
<p>
Additionally, I was referring to the bodies in earth orbit that James<br>
referred to, as well as near earth orbit that come within cislunar<br>
distance every few years. <br>
