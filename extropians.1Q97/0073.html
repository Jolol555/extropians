 I'm not saying X-nity hasn't hampered science; obviously it has.  But it<br>
 may also have caused it.  Would pagan Germanic tribes have discovered<br>
 science? (snip)<br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;&gt;Hunh.  Actually that's something I've noted in SF: superstitious</i><br>
 anarchists rival 'scientific' ones in representation.  Vinge's Mikin are<br>
 superstitious as hell; Cherryh's atevi (_Foreigner_ series, ruled by<br>
 non-geographical warlords or PPLs, depending on your POV) answer to<br>
 numerology.<br>

  Yes hmmmm, Separating the motive from the madness, so to speak. <br>
 <br>
The history of Western art has this same dichotomy.  At the same time Xtians<br>
were fostering art and nurturing such technical advances as perspective, and<br>
color theory, they were placing huge restrictions on content, style and<br>
mediums. Banning anatomy lessons and so forth. Yet they commisioned music and<br>
art and kept the wheels spinning. I am not sure it was so with science, but I<br>
see your point.<br>
[If you ask me, the devil and hell played a much more important role in good<br>
 art, since the pictures of hellfire and brimstone were ever popular themes.<br>
You have to give the public what they want (sounds like Hollywood).]<br>
<p>
The Egyptians made some amazing medical and architectual advances, due to a<br>
really looney superstion about afterlife - but then, when preserving the body<br>
for the afterlife, they threw away the brain!<br>
<p>
We had a thread re:  Olympics and how "god" got the credit for running the<br>
fastest race on earth, I think it was Max More, who said please let him know<br>
when we were in the 20th Century (which sparked a debate about FAITH and how<br>
it causes people to excell and wasn't that a good thing ? - even if it was<br>
self delusional, it had results _ I disagree).<br>
I think there is very little evidence that religion, dogma or self delusion<br>
is ever the "cause" of rationality, but historicaly highly motivated people<br>
can achieve a modicum of reason even in the most entropic-meme-infested<br>
waters.<br>
<p>
As for comparing destructive stupid-stitions with constructivist beliefs, I<br>
recommend Natasha's new "Exemplar" art series - yet to be published, which<br>
speaks to the issue of creating our own, new, Extropic myth which is based<br>
on, not contradictory to, reality... <br>
<p>
When we look back on things like the Spanish Inquisition and insane shit like<br>
the Nazi "scientists", there may indeed be some advances"caused" by such<br>
evil, but one doesnt deduce that science depends on destructive, illusionary<br>
mass hysteria.<br>
