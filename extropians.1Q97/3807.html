<i>&gt; No doubt Terry Bisson, author of this play, would find it hilarious that</i><br>
<i>&gt; his work is being stolen and disseminated from list to list without</i><br>
<i>&gt; acknowledgement.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, Terry Bisson has given his permission to have that story<br>
(and apparently only that story) freely scattered about the Net, so<br>
long as he gets proper credit for it.<br>
<p>
Some chowderhead appropriated it a long, long time ago.  Easily over a<br>
year ago.  Somewhat more recently, it spread to rec.arts.sf.written,<br>
where it was suddenly Noticed by the senior editor of Tor Books, who<br>
was wroth and displeased-- and rightly so.<br>
<p>
At that point, Terry stepped in and graciously allowed that story to<br>
be distributed freely as long as he got proper credit.  <br>
<p>
Those who do not wish to take my word can use DejaNews to search<br>
rec.arts.written.sf for articles from Patrick Nielsen Hayden with the<br>
words "Terry Bisson" in them.  If I could remember the thread title,<br>
I'd name it here.<br>
<p>
What bothers me is that Terry _still_ isn't getting credit, even in<br>
the face of his good natured generosity.<br>
