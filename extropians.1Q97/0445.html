"A designer who attempts to build a large neural network on a single <br>
chip faces a problems common to all integrated circuits. We list some <br>
of the major problems here. The first is cross talk. Closely spaced <br>
wires tend to act as little antennas and get their signals mixed together<br>
even if they are not physically connected. A second is decreased operating<br>
speed. At the very small separations found in the most densely packed<br>
integrated circuits, inductances and capacitances between the various<br>
circuit elements become so large that they greatly slow the rate of<br>
travel of electrical signals. A third is that the time spent by an<br>
electron in passing through some parts of highly miniaturized circuits<br>
is not long enough for the electron to affect the circuit. A fourth<br>
has to do with the microscopic distribution of the elements placed<br>
into the silicon to give it the desired electrical characteristics.<br>
On a macroscopic scale, these elements are randomly distributed; on a<br>
microscopic scale, however, there is no way to ensure that they will<br>
be distributed evenly enough to guarantee uniform electrical properties<br>
to the silicon.<br>
A fifth problem is electromigration. Electrons passing down the tiny<br>
conductors bump the atoms and cause them to migrate slowly towards<br>
the positive end of the wire. There are so few atoms in the tiny <br>
interconnect wires of these circuits in the first place that even a <br>
small rearrangement sometimes results in a break in the wire. Sixth,<br>
there is the problem of off-chip interconnect delays. For a given<br>
number of neurodes on each chip, the number of interchip connections<br>
required increases directly as the number of the neurodes in the <br>
network being implemented. For instance, a 1-million-neurode<br>
network will require 1000 chips and 1000 sets of interconnecting <br>
wires. The speed of operation of such a system will probably be<br>
slower than if all neurodes were on the same chip because it takes<br>
time for the electrical signals to move the distances between chips.<br>
Finally, there is a serious difficulty arising from the number of the<br>
pins we can physically attach to a chip. This makes it difficult to<br>
get rapid input and output for large masses of data. It also causes<br>
difficulty in building highly interconnected network structures from<br>
multiple chips."<br>
