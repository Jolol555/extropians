John K Clark,<br>
<p>
Interesting review of history we have gotten into here by recounting the <br>
somewhat varying perspectives of different authors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Speaking of blunders, Bell actually wrote his paper in 1964 and sent it off</i><br>
<i>&gt; to Reviews of Modern Physics, they promptly misfiled it someplace in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; vast office. Two years later they finely found it and published it in 1966.</i><br>
<i>&gt; To treat such a vastly important paper in such a way is a scandal, Reviews of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Modern Physics is no longer in operation.</i><br>
<p>
Thanks for the tidbit, this almost gives new meaning to the word scandal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;            &gt;isn't the application of a set average to the individual members</i><br>
<i>&gt;            &gt;of a set flawed on purely mathematical grounds?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No. If for example every member of a set has a value of 10.2 then the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; set certainly has a average value of 10.2. Von Neumann wasn't such a fool</i><br>
<i>&gt; that he didn't realize that there are other ways the average could end up</i><br>
<i>&gt; being that number, but he didn't think they were physically reasonable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He was wrong about that.</i><br>
<p>
Supposedly both Bell and Mermin have used the word silly in describing von<br>
Neumann's proof and the assumptions that went into it.  I will grant that<br>
they may be overly harsh in hind-sight, but I'm not sure we want to start<br>
ascribing the type of infallibility to von Neumann that, ahem, certain other<br>
people ascribe to say someone like Paul.<br>
<p>
I also point out that your counter example is only mathematically correct if<br>
the values of the individual members are actually known.  That this is true <br>
is not at all clear in this quantum mechanics business.  This quite likely<br>
could be related to what Grete Hermann was complaining about.  Since Victor<br>
J Stenger contradicts both Bell and Mermim (and presumably Hermann too) about<br>
the lack of mathematical error in von Neumann's work, getting to the bottom<br>
of this will probably take some digging.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This was only a small part of Von Neumann's 1932 book and it is still</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered a masterpiece. For example, in it he proved that although they</i><br>
<i>&gt; look very different, Schrodinger's and Heisenberg's versions of Quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mechanics are logically equivalent.</i><br>
<p>
This is incongruous too.  I thought that Dirac had proven the equivalence<br>
of these many years earlier.  Perhaps von Neumann simplified it or made <br>
the presentation of Dirac's proof more elegant in some way.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;You say that "There would be nothing illogical about a world that</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;worked that way" (referring to one that followed von Neumann's proof)</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;but such a world is one in which microcausality is hopelessly lost,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;which for me, is about as illogical as we can get.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I know of no law of logic the demands that every event have a cause.</i><br>
<p>
Technically I would agree, BUT such a statement amounts to a sweeping and <br>
profound metaphysical statement.  I might even be inclined to agree, but<br>
I don't feel logic should be dismissed before we've exhausted the pos-<br>
sibilities of using it.  Specifically, I feel it should be applied to the<br>
puzzles of advanced-action now that the "action" seems to be there.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;With the modern understanding that advanced-action can reduce all of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the puzzling phenomena of quantum physics down to one concise</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;deterministic explanation, I would say that it's all water under the</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;bridge</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some say  John Cramer's Transactional interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterministic, but to do so one must stretch the meaning of "deterministic",</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps to the breaking point, it has little to do with our everyday use of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the word. </i><br>
<p>
It's really doesn't stretch the meaning so much as we may first think.  The<br>
reason is that when we talk about:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In everything EXCEPT Quantum Mechanics when we say "A causes B" we</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean that whenever you find A you can be certain to find B further along the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time sequence; this is NOT at all what Cramer means when he talks about</i><br>
<i>&gt; causes and determinism.</i><br>
<p>
we are already in deep shit with just Maxwells equations.  Einstein went a long<br>
way toward fixing this when he developed special relativity, but it introduced<br>
(or perhaps failed to fix) the paradox that when causality manifests itself<br>
through forces that propagate on lightlike vectors such as the EM force (and<br>
presumably gravity also) that it automatically entangles the causal sequence of<br>
reality in conflicting definitions of A causes B unless exactly the amount of<br>
advance action that Cramer talks about is added to the picture.<br>
<p>
With hindsight QM might have been anticipated through timely appreciation of<br>
this paradox, but then again hindsight is always so much clearer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This would certainly have horrified Einstein, he didn't much like a nondeter-</i><br>
<i>&gt; ministic universe but a non-local one bothered him far more.</i><br>
<p>
Actually Cramer's transactional interpretation does not necessarily imply non-<br>
locality so much as the fact that local causal principles propagate (on the<br>
microcausal level) symmetrically bidirectionally through time.  I agree in<br>
advance that Einstein might well be rolling over in his grave, but  philosopher<br>
Huw Price in his book 'Time's Arrow and Archimedes Point' also makes the point<br>
that the temporally symmetrical bidirectional causality on the microcausal <br>
level could also have been anticipated by some of the problems Boltzmann was<br>
having with his work; both arguments are compelling IMO, although Price's <br>
arguments are somewhat dense.<br>
<p>
The big question in my mind, and area of greatest interest, is what the<br>
f... is going on in macrocausality.  As far as I can see, many assumptions<br>
that we have long been comfortable with are lined up like dominoes.<br>
