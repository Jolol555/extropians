        Kudos to Max More for doing a stellar job of conveying the general<br>
extropian view on cloning.  He dispelled the theistic ideas that cloning<br>
is against God's Will, not to mention the nature vs. science meme; in<br>
addition, he defined the individual consciousness that each clone will<br>
acquire.  Throughout the interview, he made numerous allusions to more<br>
effective technologies that, as extropians, we seem to find commonplace.<br>
<p>
        The problem with the program itself was that the interview was<br>
interspersed with primordial footage regarding cloning which, in effect,<br>
took away from the ideas that Max was conveying.  Also, the cinematographer<br>
seemed to find it humorous to section the screen, making it appear that Max<br>
was "cloned" on the television set.  But all in all, the content of the<br>
interview was of a very high quality, and I'm sure that<br>
all who watched the program have found a new way to perceive cloning, if not<br>
technology itself. <br>
<p>

                                        Job Well Done!<br>
