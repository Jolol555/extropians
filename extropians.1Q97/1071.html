<i>&gt; "Joel 'Twisty' Nye" &lt;me@twisty.org&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  The success of the Satan meme is not trivial... notice that even the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  recent "Freddy Kruger" and "Jason" flicks depict their villians as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  being "Straight from Hell."  It's one thing to blame things on "Sin"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  as those obstacles we let stand between ourselves and God... Yet, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a much more powerful suggestion to say that there is a malicious</i><br>
<i>&gt;  intelligence that is stalking us, bent on the goal of our destruction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Extropians usually want to disempower superstition.  I for one </i><br>
<i>&gt;  wouldn't mind seeing the start of a discipline called "Y'shuaism"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  which would be everything Christianity was meant to be, without</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the superstition and judgementality.  (One can be a disciple of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Jesus' teachings, similar to Confucianism, without the need for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the Divine mythos that was later built around it.  Jesus was a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  healer, not a rabbi or soldier, and his only true "diety" is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  he was a "son" of the "God is Love" equation.)</i><br>
<p>
Superstition, myth, aphorisms, dogma, and the like /are/ successful.<br>
Even as an unwavering advocate of reason, I can see their value in a<br>
few contexts: * Teaching children how to behave in terms they can<br>
understand and use while they're in the process of learning why; * To<br>
supply shortcuts, rules of thumb, that can be used to make timely<br>
decisions about newly-encountered situations when there isn't time for<br>
rigorous analysis; * To provide examples (in the form of myths) to<br>
explain principles.<br>
<p>
Of course, I also recommend complete honesty: I do not think the value<br>
of a myth is lost by /knowing/ that it is a myth.  Personifying evil<br>
in the form of a Satan should be just as effective to those who don't<br>
really believe in his physical existence (which, let's admit, is most<br>
of those who use the myth).  Even Rand made her mark with works of<br>
fiction.  I am inspired as often--if not more--by Howard Roark as by<br>
Rand herself.<br>
<p>
So why not create extropian myths, aphorisms, holidays, idioms?  In<br>
fact, the resistance to do so might give us the false impression that<br>
those we create inadvertantly have more meaning than they do.<br>
<p>
I must say, though, that I find not a single thing worthwhile about<br>
Jesus's teachings at all.  He is the classic self-sacrificial altruist,<br>
mindlessly vengeful (e.g., the fig tree), praising "faith" (mysticism<br>
and uncritical acceptance of dogma), "hope" (begging for supernatural<br>
favors instead of working to better yourself), and "charity" (self-<br>
sacrifice and self-loathing).  He was anti-capitalist ("camel through<br>
the needle's eye..."), pro-government ("render unto Caesar...").  To<br>
hell with him, I'll pick my own heroes.  "And yea, Feynmann said unto<br>
his students..."<br>
