In a message dated 97-03-09 01:49:06 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  As we've learned from the <br>
 past, the future's going to look alot like it looks now. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
"That's right, we will all keep living as we now do, in communities on Earth<br>
and plowing our fields with tractors driven by human farmers.  New human<br>
bodies and  designs are totally irrational and can never be improved much as<br>
we have learned from the past 4-5 million years.  More powerful brains and<br>
artistic body systems are "not even" science fiction, they are fantasy; would<br>
cost too much to develop and build, plus can not be made with any existing<br>
technology nor any foreseeable technology."   <br>
 <br>
------------------------------------------------------- <br>
Strategy to overcome new ideas.  Try to foster the following memes: <br>
 <br>
1.  Anything wildly different from what we have now is not just speculation<br>
but totally out of the question and a waste of time even to talk about<br>
because of violations of solid scientifically proven laws of nature.  Since<br>
99 out of 100 new research ideas end in failure, it is not cost effective to<br>
work on any new research projects. <br>
 <br>
2.  If you think you can try this:  "I've been a research scientist<br>
(microbiologist, physicist, etc.) for over 20 years and I should know.  I<br>
have never invented anything and know it's useless.  To better humanity, I<br>
have tried my hardest to point out where new ideas will fail in order to<br>
prevent any time/money wasting projects."   <br>
 <br>
3.  Only ideas that are obvious are worthwhile, only those should be talked<br>
about, no "brainstorming" or modifications of the fantasy ideas.  If an idea<br>
might not work the first time, such as a new kind of human skin,  tell those<br>
people where they will (not just might) go wrong. Do it right now and save<br>
them a lot of trouble.  Even better, slap them down a couple of times and<br>
they will learn to be pessimistic and not be so bold the next time.   <br>
 <br>
For example make sure people don't waste time questioning the TWA crash or<br>
that HIV might not be the only (100%) cause of AIDS or our carbon based skin<br>
is good enough, we don't need silicone.  Come up with enough negative<br>
references and that should change their minds.  I call it: "Dynamic<br>
Pessimism."  <br>
 <br>
4.  The worst thing you can do is try to show those silly "silicone" people<br>
where they might modify their idea and make it work.  That only encourages<br>
fantasy ideas not science and makes fools out of legitimate scientists and<br>
engineers.   <br>
 <br>
5.  Its much better if you "forget" to point out small semantic corrections<br>
until you can pounce on the ideas giver:  For instance if they protest your<br>
negativism, say:  "I didn't say  all ________________, that would be<br>
incredibly stupid.  But, _______________, is used as a ______________ is not<br>
as you said a _____________.  Obviously.   So I think you can now see where<br>
you were wrong and I know the correct nature of  ___________ ", (fill in the<br>
blank with their idea or project.  This implies that the idea giver is stupid<br>
or foolish or is not knowledgeable, or forgetful and will then be unworthy of<br>
consideration. <br>
 <br>
6.  Don't be satisfied letting them think what they want.  Actively try to<br>
change their minds: "Preach."  But don't be too brash or they will catch on<br>
to you.   <br>
 <br>
. . .  You should tell them "You're entitled to your opinion, but I think<br>
it's irresponsible to make that the view based on the scientific evidence and<br>
known reference material.  All good science is based on what we've learned<br>
from the past.  We know the future's going to look a lot like it looks right<br>
now."     <br>
 <br>
Then, make it real for them by filling in their project's or idea like this:<br>
  " ___________ is a cliche from bad sci. fi.."  Or, " ___________ is BEYOND<br>
science fiction and could never be achieved.  It is a _fantasy_ that<br>
encourages bad science and even religious cults.  If I wanted to read bad<br>
science fiction based on nothing, I'd read ____________ ."  (name of any<br>
legitimate creative idea publication nut be careful not to use Extropy or<br>
WIRED, use Mondo 2000 possibly)."   <br>
 <br>
7.  Further Reading:  _How to Loose Friends and Alienate People_.   <br>
 <br>
8.  List of powerful words and phrases to use for squashing fantasy ideas: <br>
abuse of science (scientific data),  <br>
betray, bizarre, bureaucracy, <br>
collapse, crisis, consequences,  cynical as in "I don't want to be cynical,<br>
but. . . "  <br>
destructive, destroy, devour, disgrace science,  (let me be a) devil's<br>
advocate (for one minute.", dreamer, <br>
endanger,  (will be an) enigma for all time, (it's not) ethical, <br>
failure (fail), fantasy, foolish, force, <br>
government (anything the government is in will be instantly negative),<br>
 greed, goofy, <br>
hypocrisy, <br>
insensitive, ideal (when used to mean unrealistic), ideological, impose, <br>
(your idea is) "just" a ______, (pipe dream, fantasy, etc.)  <br>
kill, <br>
lie, (there are) limits, <br>
money, mandate, (it's not moral) <br>
never, not, nothing,  <br>
(only your) opinion,  obsolete, obviously.  <br>
pathetic,  (too) permissive, (I don't want to be) pessimistic, but. . . " <br>
quit, quite (-the opposite"), <br>
red tape,  <br>
sick, shallow (thinking), self-serving,  sensationalists <br>
taxes, they, them,  threaten,  <br>
unrealistic, <br>
violates (science), <br>
waste, whim, wrong,  <br>
x-rays killed the discoverer, zero (denoting no progress),  <br>
you are young (implied "and foolish"), years-and-years (pessimistic<br>
denotation), <br>
zig-zag (implying not well thought out), zany,   <br>
 <br>
9.  Words and phrases _not_ to use on the ExI list when trying to be<br>
"Dynamically Pessimistic" about new ideas: <br>
active, alright, astute observation, <br>
better, because, building,  <br>
change, challenge, courage, children, compete, commitment, care, creative,<br>
choice, <br>
dogmatic, debate,  dream (not "dreamer"),  <br>
evolution, (help the) environment, eliminate (death, sickness, etc.),  <br>
freedom, (to be) fair (then state to opposition's opinion), <br>
glad, great, good, goals, <br>
happy, healthy, honest, <br>
(new, good, creative etc.) idea(s), incentive, initiative,  information, <br>
joy,  <br>
knowledge, kind,  <br>
limits (there are none, or few),  legacy, liberty, listen, learn, leadership,<br>
light,  <br>
movement to future goals, mobilize,  <br>
nanotechnology,  <br>
optimistic,  <br>
prosperity,  provide, principles, premise, (life is) precious, (new) pristine<br>
future, <br>
(advantageous) qualities,    <br>
rights, restore, repaired, <br>
share, success, strength,  <br>
truth, teach,  <br>
utility, use, unencumbered,  <br>
vaccine, valued, verge (of discovering),  <br>
wealth, weather (control),   <br>
 <br>
10.  Other words of special interest to the ExI list: <br>
 <br>
Don't use "big business" ( as in: it's nothing but), that's a tip off phrase<br>
to ExI list members as are the words: Liberal, Socialism, socialist,<br>
Libertarian, and capitalist.  If you want to be Dynamically Pessimistic don't<br>
get involved with the words, there are too many opportunities to be<br>
optimistic. <br>
 <br>
"Control" is a dangerous word, see coercion. <br>
 <br>
"Coercion": Non-coercion is OK but be careful using "coercion."   The<br>
libertarians (like me) will start reading more carefully.  You don't want<br>
that to tip them off to your negative intentions. <br>
 <br>
Use "radical" only when meaning _unrealistic_ when being Dynamically<br>
pessimistic,  otherwise ExI List members might think "radical" is good and<br>
could mean "a creative optimistic technology."  <br>
 <br>
"Sociable" is however very good to use to hide your Dynamic Pessimism, and is<br>
one of the basis of libertarian people getting along with each other in<br>
peace, outside of government forced peace. <br>
 <br>
"Selfish":  Can be used positively/optimistically (e.g., Ayn Rand) or<br>
negatively pessimistically (non-Rand) <br>
 <br>
"Unrealistic"  is very good when being Dynamically Pessimistic.  After all<br>
most people, think "being realistic is good."  Unrealistic is a fast way to<br>
stop idea flow;  a very effective meme.   <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
 <br>
On second thought.  The people on the ExI list are too smart to be lead into<br>
pessimism.  You might just as well get infected by their optimism and<br>
contribute optimism to the list if you can.   <br>
