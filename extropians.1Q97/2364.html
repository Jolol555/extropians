hmmm, could this imply: "no money - no justice" ? People are very likely to<br>
start taking justice in their own hands in such a system...<br>
Which may put us right back into situations we have just overcome. <br>
<p>
Also, you're still stuck with a powerstructure in the form of a 'protection<br>
agency' who could very well start abusing their power,  and start filling<br>
up the powervacuum, causing a city or state to call upon another protection<br>
agency for protection from the first ? what will their price be,<br>
consessions limiting the cities freedom maybe ? <br>
<p>
Problem is that i can't see where this solution is likely to maintain the<br>
powervacuum, or create a system where that power is distributed widely.<br>

<i>&gt;I personally believe that scarcity is a fundamental irreducible attribute</i><br>

<p>
i agree.<br>

This is what i tried to make clear to Eric in a posting a long time ago, i<br>
guess i couldn't find the right words, and i must have been misunderstood,<br>
which is why i reacted reserved this time. I said then the companies were<br>
behind it, whereas i now see where Eric would have placed responsability<br>
for the system on the state. I don't think either of them are willing to<br>
give patents up. (that is the state and companies, not Eric !  :-) )  <br>

<p>
Sure, i just have more than ONE political goal, and am open to cooperation<br>
with people who might disagree with one of the others.<br>
