Of course I don't mean to paint Extropians with the same brush.  Instead <br>
I'll take the other simplified approach and divide us into two <br>
groups.  The "Select" are those of us who will be selected by nature and <br>
each other to make it to  the future: to the Singularity, should that <br>
occur, or otherwise through cryonics, uploading, and the wonderful<br>
future beyond.   The  "Compost" are those who, by neglect, will <br>
find themselves doomed as  all humans before them have been <br>
doomed.   Of course luck will play a big part, but of the <br>
factors under the control of our persons and our  small groups,  <br>
the following are some concrete manifestations of character which <br>
distinguish Select from Compost:<br>
<p>
Select					Compost<br>
--------				------------<br>
Knows the locations of the local	    Can point out all the Apollo <br>
  healthy restaraunts, 24-hour drugstore,	landing sites on the Moon.<br>
  hospital, health food store, and <br>
  technical bookstore<br>
<p>
"Vegan" an important dietary habit	"Vegan" a fascinating creature <br>
					    met while on a trip<br>
<p>
Overcomes addictions			Thinks nicotine's "smart drug <br>
   					   effects" outweigh the risks<br>
<p>
Telecommutes				Joyrides in personal airplanes<br>
<p>
Can on occasion predict particular      Can precisely pinpoint <br>
  market prices using unique 		  the date of the Singularity<br>
    information				<br>
<p>
Can recognize and differentiate between	   Can nitpick all the physics <br>
  good and  bad epidemiological studies        errors in a sci-fi movie<br>
<p>
Knows the names of good doctors,          Knows the names of the <br>
	dentists, and nutritionists	     entire "Deep Space Nine" cast<br>
<p>
<p>
Develops relationships and community	Treats cryonics like an <br>
	towards  mutual assistance        anonymous cash transaction<br>
		in cryonics	<br>
<p>
	And the #1 way to distinguish Select from Compost:<br>
<p>
Evolves via daily survival &amp; growth	Evolves via alien upload to a comet<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Onwards,<br>
Zylof<br>
