<i>&gt;  &gt;Eric Watt Forste asks:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; What is an "intrinsic value system"?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;Pister found a way to put the concept of intrinsic value across</i><br>
clearly. To<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;the question What good is it?, he replied, What good are you? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Okay. You're talking Kantian ethics. I can understand that. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; how will "intrinsic value systems" "free" us from money? We've had</i><br>
<i>&gt; intrinsic value systems since the European Enlightenment at least.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Either that, or you haven't really told me what you mean by "intrinsic</i><br>
<i>&gt; value systems".</i><br>
<p>
Accounting systems use money fields to create a lot of reconciliation<br>
make-work. I've re-used these fields to express a graded value by using<br>
whatever comes to mind concerning the transaction. I hope to feed these<br>
transactions into my fuzzy AI memory banks. Sure, the old records still<br>
have dollars showing in these records, as I haven't the time or inclination<br>
to re-value them, but the record keeping of the event is what is important<br>
for me as a source of inspiration for my uploaded identity. The fact that I<br>
am saved time and effort by not trying to sum these values into a net<br>
balance is a great advantage and does not cause confusion. I can recreate a<br>
transaction list of any of a series of events as proof enough that they<br>
took place and contributed as an alibi to my intrinsic value. I suggest<br>
that if the make-work currently being expended to cure the 2000 bug is<br>
unsuccessful and that balances get corrupted anyway that these values just<br>
be accepted at face value. Let this event put an end to the nightmarish<br>
reconciliation and lets all just continue to pump out goods and services.<br>
Keep the record keeping infrastructure but remove from the bankers their<br>
power to value reputations. Just think about how the most sophisticated<br>
computer system for manufacturing, say, can keep going even if every value<br>
field was unified. Call a spade a spade. How much quality have you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; The discussion of Pister that you quote above also fails to</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguish between valuers, treating "value" as something that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; independent of the valuer, rather than a relation between the valuer</i><br>
<p>
My defense is that:<br>
<p>
1) I will to be an uploader with synthetic patterns of ongoing life. <br>
2) I will to be both the valuer and the systems that are valued. <br>
3) I will face-off with governments as the essence of my strategy. <br>
4) I will to proclaim old extrinsic value systems to the dustbin of<br>
history. <br>
5) I am certainly not confused nor is my exoself only the parasitic<br>
language is.<br>
6) I can never be bankrupted. <br>
7) I can only be killed by confused Scientology-like governments denying my<br>
reality.<br>
8) I will to virtuality.<br>
9) I am protected under conventions for diplomatic agents.<br>
<p>
<p>
Best,<br>
