Thank you, Tony, for your compliments.  I enjoy writing to this list very <br>
much, and I'm glad that others are enjoying my writing too.  I'm wanting to <br>
write several books (and hypertexts, and other such things) eventually, and <br>
writing on this forum is certainly giving me the practice I need to improve my <br>
writing.  It's also helping me develop my ideas more fully and clearly.  Also, <br>
developing my writing skills will help me prepare for college this fall (I've <br>
*finally* decided to go, after being out of high school for the past four and <br>
a half years, studying *lots* of things independently).  I'm going to the Reed <br>
College, in Portland, Oregon, and the students there are required to do *a <br>
lot* of writing.  I figure if I get used to thinking up and writing a good <br>
quality post here almost every day, I will be well prepared for college.  <br>
Probably *far* more prepared than *most* of the students.  I guess it's <br>
difficult for me to settle for any less than impressing the hell out of <br>
everybody.<br>
<p>
All comments and criticisms of my writings and my ideas are welcomed by me.  <br>
I'm always on the lookout for ways to improve what I do, and I'm also pleased <br>
to know when I'm doing something well.<br>
<p>
