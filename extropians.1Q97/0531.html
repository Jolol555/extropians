----------<br>
<i>&gt; From: David Musick </i><br>
<i>&gt; The era of Huge Organizations is nearly over.  I don't see how they can</i><br>
last <br>
<i>&gt; with all the little guys scurrying around, snatching up business</i><br>
opportunities <br>
<i>&gt; all over the place, starving the Big Boys.  Because they are more</i><br>
effiecient, <br>
<i>&gt; small companies will have lower prices than huge ones, and they will</i><br>
attract <br>
<i>&gt; more business</i><br>
<p>
I don't quite agree here. I actually think that smaller corporations are a<br>
bit more inefficient. Let's just say that a typical company in advertising<br>
charges about $150 per hour for work done. That might sound like a lot.<br>
Compared to a one man corp. But these $150 dollars an hour is for actual<br>
production work. What's not included here is saleswork, administration,<br>
Rooms, transportation, equipment, and off course a profit for the owner<br>
(for taking the financial risk) etc. Sales and administration has to be<br>
done by a one man corp too and i don't know any one man corp where the<br>
owner is good at that. But it takes time away from production.<br>
Also you can argue that a one man corp don't have to make money for the<br>
owner. But waht about pensions then and what about loans from the bank etc.<br>
Any technology that will make it easier for a one man corp to do sale and<br>
administration will also make it easier for larger corporation. <br>
<p>
Also price isn't the the most important factor when it comes to selecting<br>
who you hire.<br>
Some employees gets a higher salary because they are better at their work,<br>
and the same goes for companies. Not to mention trust thru redundancy.<br>
Would you put your company's future in the hand of a one man corp where the<br>
owner can loose his ability to work form day to day?<br>
<p>
It is simply not possible to work below a certain hourly price unless you<br>
seriously wants to lower your standard of living. Therefore i don't think<br>
that smaller corporations will be a lot more efficient than larger one.<br>
