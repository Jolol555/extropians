I'm not sure I see the necessity of preventing someone from changing<br>
his posted information.  If he presents a weak argument, and then<br>
withdraws it, haven't those who disagree accomplished their purpose?<br>
How much more is gained by continuing to throw his earlier errors in<br>
his face?  If the goal is to approach the truth, then there should be<br>
nothing wrong with people evolving their publications in the face of<br>
criticism.<br>
<p>
I agree that for some purposes, like official documents, contracts, and<br>
the like, a method is needed to hold them stably.  But for hypertext<br>
publishing and debate, it seems counterproductive to try to keep people<br>
from revising their work.<br>
