You build bigger missiles with more fuel.  Then they go faster.  Of<br>

But energetically much closer.  11 km/sec closer.  Wait, that reminds<br>

Luna is about a light-second away; 3e5 kilometers.  Terrestrial escape<br>
velocity is 11 km/sec.  300,000/11 is 27,000 seconds is 7.5 hours.  So a<br>
missile that could barely escape Earth's surface could, if launched from<br>
our orbit, reach the Moon in 7.5 hours.  What was that about Saturns,<br>

Wow.  Read your science fiction.  Lots of starry-eyed (groan) idealists<br>
would do so.  Well, maybe not lots, but enough to start a colony.<br>

skills have a high value in space, not brute labor.<br>

Leaders change.  All the more so under threat.  Russia and China have<br>
different leaders.  And your "humane" leaders are the same ones who<br>
permanently exiled lots of welfarees.  You're not adding up here.<br>
<p>
Missiles in Earth orbit can ensure MAD with Luna -- no one's advantage.<br>
Military at Luna can make MAD highly unlikely -- advantage, Earth.  A<br>
small, "brain drain", colony may well be sentimental about Earth and<br>
morally unable to wipe out 6 billion people and an ecosystem.  Resentful<br>
rabble won't have much moral weight at home, else they wouldn't have<br>
been shipped there in the first place.  True, they could have been<br>
shipped by heartless leaders while rebelling under wimpy leaders; my<br>
point isn't that Luna can't rebel, but that it isn't guaranteed to.<br>

Belters I don't know about.  And if anyone manages to live on Mercury<br>

you can't find us") ("well, you probably can, but can you hit us?")<br>
they'll be in choice positions.<br>
