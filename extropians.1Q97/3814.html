[Message resent because of list server failure.  Apologies if<br>
it appears twice.]<br>
<p>
I promised last night to do two things: post information about<br>
the actual dates of patent and copyright law, and to recount<br>
my ideas about private non-coercive alternatives.<br>
<p>
First, I discovered that the USPTO was created in 1802, only three<br>
years after the Constitution gave congress the authority to do so,<br>
so I must conclude that the patent concept was generally accepted<br>
at that time, and there was no prolonged period between those<br>
events, so I was mistaken to claim otherwise.  There were, of<br>
course, manufacturing industries and printing industries prior to<br>
the Constitution itself (Franklin's print shop, Revere's Smithy<br>
are obvious examples), and limits to the application of those laws<br>
to foreign works, as Mr. Fallon points out.  The present form of<br>
IP law is largely shaped by international treaties such as the<br>
Berne convention, NAFTA, and GATT.<br>
<p>
Toward my second promise, I already gave a list of means by which<br>
one might profit from a technical invention without the aid of a<br>
patent, so I will concentrate here on making money as an author in<br>
the absence of copyright.  I do not think these lists are by any<br>
means exhaustive, but I am optimistic that businessmen will find<br>
more ways to make money than I can imagine, and anyway, I do not<br>
consider mine or anyone's failure of imagination to be an adequate<br>
justification for keeping the status quo.  My means appear at the<br>
end of this article.<br>
<p>
Finally, I know that some people may be thinking, "OK, even if I<br>
accept that a world without copyrights and patents is possible,<br>
what harm is there?  Who suffers from the present system?"  The<br>
answer is the same as for any other subsidy: everything not thus<br>
subsidized suffers a tiny bit, and the beneficiary gains a great<br>
deal.  That's why subsidies are politically safe: one man gains a<br>
lot, at the expense of millions losing so little that they don't<br>
have much incentive to complain.  But as Friedman and others have<br>
shown with more detailed economic analysis, the net gains are<br>
always less than the net losses, because a subsidy changes the<br>
relative value of the commodity subsidized, leading to inefficient<br>
trades in every business affected by that commodity.  <br>
<p>
Copyrights and Patents artificially increase the value of creativity.<br>
If I had to name one thing most devalued, it would /workmanship/.<br>
When the creative effort involved in the production of a good is<br>
a major cost, it reduces the amount available for other factors<br>
of production.  The price of a good is fixed by what the consumer<br>
will bear, so the more you pay an author/inventor, the less you can<br>
pay the builders.  The imposed monopoly has yet another effect on<br>
workmanship: not only does it cause less money to be available for<br>
it, but it also reduces the demand for it, because the producer<br>
doesn't have to compete with other companies using the same idea.<br>
The publisher of Dawkin's /Selfish Gene/ doesn't have to compete<br>
with anyone else publishing the same work, so he can produce it as<br>
sloppily as he cares to, and if the ideas are sufficient to sell<br>
the book, it doesn't matter that the title rubs off and the cover<br>
falls apart.<br>
<p>
Contrast this to publishers who sell, say, the Bible.  They compete<br>
diectly with others producing the same work, so Bibles tend to<br>
come with nice leather covers, concordances and other appendices,<br>
gold edges, red letters and annotations, and other added value.<br>
<p>
Authoring without Copyrights<br>
<p>
- The most obvious advantage an author has is being first to market<br>
  with his ideas.  The software industry shows how valuable that is.<br>
  One can make millions being the first with a good idea, even for a<br>
  short period after Microsoft tries to take you over :-)<br>
<p>
- You can sell subsidiary properties.  With software, that's things<br>
  like upgrades and support, that copiers can't provide.  With a book,<br>
  you might sell access to additional notes by the author, signed<br>
  copies (your competitors can't sign your name without committing<br>
  fraud), personal appearances, discussion lists, early release of<br>
  new works by the same author, etc.<br>
<p>
- You can use technologies for exclusion.  In software, that's copy<br>
  protection, dongles, etc.  For books, that's selling them over the<br>
  net with contractual agreements not to reproduce (look at Science<br>
  magazine on the net for example).  Also Pay Per View, exclusive<br>
  book clubs, etc.<br>
<p>
- You can sell the author's good name and proven talents in other<br>
  ways.  Personal appearances, reviews of related works, translations<br>
  or explications of other works, selection of works of interest by<br>
  other authors, adaptations of his own or other works to new media<br>
  or to new audiences, ghost-writing celebrity bios, etc.<br>
<p>
- You can write time-critical material.  News, topical commentary,<br>
  live television, periodicals (Who wouldn't rather read Dave Barry's<br>
  latest rather than wait for the books to come out?).<br>
<p>
- You can sell your consumer attention directly, in the form of<br>
  advertising ("This chapter brought to you by...").<br>
<p>
- You can prey on consumer guilt, by selling "authorized" editions<br>
  of your work that some consumers will buy instead of cheaper copies<br>
  because they think they should.  I don't particularly like this<br>
  method, but it will probably work.<br>
<p>
I know there are others, but my hands are getting tired.<br>
