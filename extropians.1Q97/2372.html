The only place where Unix is losing ground to NT is the workstation market.<br>
NT makes a modest workgroup server, and a worthless enterprise server<br>
(despite what Microsoft would tell you).  Unix still has a stranglehold on<br>
the mid- to high-end server market.  The current NT kernel performs well for<br>
workstation apps, but poorly for most server apps due to design limitations.<br>

The problem with the NT kernel is that certain important aspects are<br>
single-threaded through CPU 0, such as I/O.  That means that NT threading is<br>
only applicable to user space computation, such as rendering.  This is also<br>
the reason NT scales poorly for things like database applications.<br>
<p>
Linux has a similar problem in the current SMP release (only one kernel<br>
lock), but is being corrected as we speak.<br>

I am hesitant to agree with this, but in a general sense you may be correct.<br>

Not to mention the proliferation of non-standard Unix "standards".<br>
