(by the way, Jim, looking back for the last &gt; wouldn't work for many<br>
of my posts because I put multiple quote-response blocks in a given message)<br>

&lt;!!!&gt;  Please, no!  Personally, one of the hopes I hold out for extended<br>
lifespan (pre-uploading) is that society can chill out and let people be<br>
"teenagers" till they're, say, 25 and their adolescence is completely<br>
over.  After uploading maybe we can stretch it out to 2500.<br>
<p>
Somehow it seems to me that many people on this list have visions of a<br>
panicked, frenzied future, where everyone has to race along at a breakneck<br>
pace in order to keep from being disenfranchised, enslaved, or<br>
exterminated.  Call me Pollyanna, but I think better of the human race<br>
than that.  Besides, even if you astrophysicists and philosophers will<br>
quibble, I think that for all practical purposes there's plenty of<br>
infinity for everybody.  For that matter, there's plenty of eternity<br>
for everybody, too.<br>
<p>
(Oh -- and for the grammar pot, it's "try to find a cure".)<br>
