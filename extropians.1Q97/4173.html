My version of the thread so far: Guru George claimed that a starfaring<br>
civilization would have to capitalist, and not socialist or fascist. I<br>
claimed that fascists can be capitalists so that distinction is confusing.<br>
Furthermore, it seems to be that any of these three types could develop a<br>
spacefaring civilization.<br>

I also skipped Goddard. But there is no denying the "big advances" part of<br>
my claim regardless. But your Soviet examples help make the point that<br>
spacefarer need not be capitalists, thanks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Interestingly enough, the most efficacious weapons</i><br>
<p>
I was discussing rocketry in the context of space exploration, not weaponry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Also, the Nazis were capitalists (despite the name 'National Socialists').</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; They didn't steal technology from capitalist, they *were* capitalists -- and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; they developed a lot of it themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They were not. Nazis were a grand-scale planned economy</i><br>
<p>
I'm borrowing from Pournelle: I don't deny that they had a planned economy,<br>
but that the capital was privately held (and therefore, capitalist). The<br>
alliance between Hitler and Stalin is not so bizarre when you realize that<br>
they had planned economies in common, even though they were at odds over<br>
whether to have private or public property. Hmm, the American space program<br>
to date has been as a result of central planning.<br>
<p>
[Aside with respect to 'Socialists'. I met a 'liberal' in Vienna a couple of<br>
weeks ago. I was surprised to learn that this is what a North American would<br>
call conservative, or in this fellow's case, libertarian. Must have<br>
something to do with the difference in voltage you use.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The collectivist aspect of the United States has a much better developed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; space program than any private industry initiative.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yet. I think soon dramatically falling LEO launch costs (and privately </i><br>
<i>&gt;funded LEO-autoassembling autoreplicator missions to Luna may desert the </i><br>
<i>&gt;barren realm of scifi) will cause a flurry of activity in low earth orbit </i><br>
<i>&gt;missions, which will render NASA uncapable of action, since entirely broke.</i><br>
<p>
I hope so. The railroad and aircraft industries in the US needed government<br>
support initially, but then were able to cut the apron strings.<br>
