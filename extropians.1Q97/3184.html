    SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 4, 1997--Nanogen Inc. Tuesday<br>
announced that it has completed a private round of financing on its <br>
Series C Preferred Stock, raising $26.2 million.<br>
          "We entered this round of financing expecting to raise about $15 <br>
million," said Howard C. Birndorf, chairman and chief executive <br>
officer of Nanogen.  "The response to the offering greatly exceeded <br>
our expectations."<br>
          The company was represented by Cowen &amp; Company which acted as <br>
exclusive placement agent.<br>
          "We were very pleased to assist Nanogen in connection with this <br>
highly successful offering," said George G. Montgomery, managing <br>
director of investment banking at Cowen.<br>
          This latest round of financing brings the total venture capital <br>
funding raised by the company since its inception in 1993 to $39 <br>
million.<br>
          The investors participating in this round represent a broad range<br>
of interests from the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan.  Major<br>
investors included the existing investors, Birndorf Biotech, <br>
Enterprise Partners, InterWest Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; <br>
Byers and Sprout Group.  New investors include Elan Corporation plc, <br>
Oracle Strategic Partners, AIG, INVESCO, MDS Health Ventures, Vulcan <br>
Ventures, Techno Ventures and Integral Capital Partners, the lead <br>
investor.<br>
          "We were pleased to have had the opportunity to act as the lead <br>
of such a diverse group of sophisticated investors,"  said John <br>
Powell, managing partner of Integral Capital Partners II, LP and <br>
Integral Capital Partners International III, L.P., two Integral <br>
Capital partnerships which specialize in investments in <br>
expansion-stage private companies and growth-stage companies in the <br>
information and life sciences industries.<br>
          "We view the success of the financing and the diversity of <br>
interests represented in this financing as a further validation of <br>
Nanogen's technology," said Tina S. Nova, Ph.D., president and <br>
chief operating officer of Nanogen.  "We have made considerable <br>
technological progress over the past year.  This funding will provide<br>
us with the flexibility to aggressively pursue our research and <br>
product development objectives in 1997 and beyond and to explore <br>
potential corporate partnerships from a position of strength."<br>
          As a consequence of the financing, Nanogen also announced that it<br>
has elected Thomas G. Lynch, executive vice president and chief <br>
financial officer of Elan Corp. plc to its board of directors, <br>
effective immediately.  Elan is a leading drug delivery and <br>
biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Ireland.  Lynch was <br>
elected following Elan's significant investment in the Series C round<br>
of financing.  The addition of Lynch to the Nanogen board increases <br>
the number of directors to eight.<br>
          "I am impressed by Nanogen's technology and have great respect <br>
for the company's management and scientific team,"  said Lynch.  "I <br>
look forward to assisting in shaping the future direction of the <br>
company."<br>
          Since his appointment at Elan in 1993, Lynch has played an <br>
integral role in the evolution and growth of the company where he is <br>
responsible for, among other things, finance, treasury, strategic <br>
planning and corporate and investor relations.  He is also a member <br>
of the executive committee of Elan's board.  Prior to joining Elan, <br>
Lynch was a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick where he specialized in <br>
securities matters and business advisory and accounting services.  <br>
Lynch is a graduate in economics from the Queen's University in <br>
Belfast and a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in <br>
Ireland.  He also serves as a director of Pembroke Capital Limited, <br>
Icon Limited, Axogen Limited and Warner Chilcott plc.<br>
          "I am excited by the addition of Mr. Lynch, who brings a wealth <br>
of international business experience and financial acumen to our <br>
board," said Birndorf.  "His considerable experience in <br>
pharmaceutical management, coupled with his insight and creativity, <br>
will be instrumental in helping to lead Nanogen through critical <br>
stages of our corporate development.  He will also give us an <br>
international perspective which will help us prepare for future <br>
global relationships."<br>
