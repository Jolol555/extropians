This thread started by my mentioning a study showing that in a<br>
*pre-industrial* society, wealthy dads did not have more kids.  <br>

Right.  No doubt in some pre-industrial societies, wealthy dads did not have<br>
more kids.  There's a lot of variety in human societies.  But in most, they<br>
had more, at least according to conventional wisdom.  In Europe, with fairly<br>
good records of births and social standing, it was definitely the case.  I'll<br>
wager it's also the case in any other large society with good records (e.g.<br>
China or the Ottoman Empire) or we'd already have heard about it.<br>
