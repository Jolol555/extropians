Notice that the usual MDMA/amphetamine mix you can buy is usually debased <br>
by all kinds of synthetical impurities/stretching stuff like strychnine &amp; <br>
Co. I think I also heard MDMA was neurotoxic, especially to substantia <br>
nigra? I also seem to recall a horror story on a overheated designer drug <br>
batch, which caused victims to (irreversibly) lock rigid in course of a <br>
single day, &lt;shudder&gt;. Before you ask, that was not an urban legend.<br>
<p>
While I am pretty laissez faire towards (nonopiate &amp; analoga) drugs, you <br>
should really know that you are taking grave risks, especially if you <br>
accept substances, produced in an uncontrolled environment (zero <br>
quality control, and all kinds of ad hoc improvisation). If you're aware <br>
of that, it's o.k., but few young techno kids really are.<br>
