<p>
I'm not sure what you're referring to by "sweeping claims" so it's hard to<br>
address your point. But, yes, you can speak about extropian writing just as<br>
you can talk about Extropic Art. Certainly, as you note, extropian writing<br>
can have several purposes, not just to inform, but to amuse, to refer to<br>
useful resources, and so so. Yet, to clearly be extropian writing it must<br>
embody extropian attitudes. Otherwise "extropian" would be utterly without<br>
content.<br>
<p>
Similarly, Extropic Art is art that embodies extropic ideas and values.<br>
It's very clear what some of those are (intelligence augmentation, life<br>
extension, greater ability to define one's self, etc.). There are other<br>
ideas and attitudes that we might argue about, but most terms (except<br>
logical and mathematical terms) include some fuzzy areas.<br>
<p>
It still makes sense to discuss questions such as whether to embody<br>
extropic ideas and attitudes it matters only that this was the artist's<br>
intention or whether an artwork succeeds in being extropic only in so far<br>
as it induces such an effect in the viewer/reader/listener/participant.<br>
Regardless of views on this, it seems perfectly clear to me that Extropic<br>
Art *does* admit of definition and understanding. Such a definition need to<br>
go into details, but to avoid some kind of definition is obfuscating and<br>
mystifying -- certainly *not* extropic traits!<br>
