You're probably right that some "Type A" personalities who already spend <br>
most of their waking hours working to get ahead would simply extend those <br>
hours to fill the remainder of the day.  Which might cause many of the <br>
rest of us to follow along in an attempt to keep up.  But the big <br>
difference, in my opinion, is that at that point a person's decision to <br>
work longer hours would be voluntary.  Right now, by contrast, I have no <br>
choice but to spend a third of my life in a useless dormant state.<br>
