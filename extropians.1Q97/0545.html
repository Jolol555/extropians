That could be very dangerous, it might make your system too powerful, <br>
so powerful it can prove things that are not true. For example, so far <br>
The Goldbach Conjecture has been shown to be true for every number we test it <br>
on, but we can't test it on every number, and so far nobody has found a way <br>
to prove it from the fundamental axioms of number theory. Suppose we give up<br>
trying to prove it correct or having computers look for a counterexample to <br>
prove it wrong, and just add it as an axiom. Consider the possibilities:   <br>
                <br>
1) The Goldbach conjecture is true and it is possible to find a proof from    <br>
   the current axioms: In this case adding  Goldbach as a Axiom is    <br>
   unnecessary and inelegant.<br>
<p>
2) The Goldbach conjecture is untrue but we add it as an axiom: Bad idea, <br>
   now you've made mathematics inconsistent. Think of the embarrassment when <br>
   some computer finds a number that violates Goldbach, your axiom. Think of <br>
   all the mathematics built on top of this dumb axiom that now must go in <br>
   the garbage can.<br>
<p>
3) The Goldbach conjecture is true but unprovable: In this case it would be    <br>
   a great idea to add Goldbach as an axiom  because then your axiomatic    <br>
   system would be more complete and just as consistent. The only trouble is,    <br>
   Turing showed us that if it's unprovable you'll never know it's unprovable,    <br>
   so it's just too dangerous to take the chance.<br>
                <br>
On the other hand, Godel doesn't say we can't know anything, he says we can't  <br>
know everything.  It's the same with Turing's results, sometimes, but not <br>
always, you can prove that a certain result can not be derived from existing <br>
axioms, so then you can add it as an axiom, IF you have courage, IF you think<br>
it is true.<br>
<p>
For example, if you take it as an axiom and assume that the parallel  <br>
postulate  is true, that is, " through any point in the plane, there is ONE ,  <br>
and only ONE, line parallel to a given line"  then a perfectly consistent <br>
geometry can be made, Euclid did it.  Strangely it's also true that If you <br>
assume "Through any point in the plane, there are TWO lines parallel to any <br>
given line" then a perfectly consistent geometry can be made, Lobachevski and <br>
Bolyai did it.  It's even true that if you assume " Through a point in the <br>
plane, NO line can be drawn parallel to a any given line" then a perfectly <br>
consistent geometry can be made, Riemann  did it.  Consistency is not<br>
everything, which one of these geometrys are true must be determined by <br>
experiment.<br>
<p>
The reason all this was possible was because the parallel postulate has been <br>
shown to be independent of the other axioms. An analogous situation has not <br>
been proven for the Goldbach  Conjecture. An even number can be found that is <br>
not the sum of two prime numbers OR it can not. There is no middle ground.  <br>
I want a system that can prove it is true, but ONLY if it is true.<br>
