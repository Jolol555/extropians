On the ownership (copyright) to your genome:<br>
<p>
Your parents composed your genome (unless you are one of those<br>
newfangled clones, but then you'd be under a year old) from work<br>
originally composed elsewhere.  Thus your parens don't own your genome,<br>
and can't charge you royalties.  You don't own your own genome either.<br>
<p>
In copyright law, it is not possible to own a fact, just the right to<br>
copy a particular (newly created) representation of that fact. <br>
<p>
An you can't own a person copied from you DNA, because you can't own a<br>
person period.<br>
<p>
Besides, you didn't create your genome, so who are you to be claiming<br>
credit for it anyway?<br>
<p>
ON cloning a genius, artist, &amp;c.<br>
<p>
It is apparently possible to clone a good-looking person from a<br>
good-looking person.  Studies indicate that physical appearance is the<br>
prime determinant of success and happiness in human life.  (Height comes<br>
into it for males, but intelligence and creativity are way down on the<br>
list for everyone.)  This is probably the way to go.<br>
<p>
Cloning a smart person, or a creative person will probably not work.  I<br>
am a genius (defined by consistent 1 out of 10 000 or better scores on<br>
intelligence/aptitude tests) and I know several others.  Everyone I know<br>
in this category thinks just like everyone I know outside this category<br>
(mostly 1 or 2 out of 100 intellects, I'll admit) .  Maybe they can hold<br>
three or four more items in short term memory, but I suspect even that<br>
is learned through experience.  The one common factor is personal<br>
interest in and inner determination to study intellectual subjects.  The<br>
environmental factors inspiring this are very consistent from family to<br>
family.  So are the childhood stories we tell each other.<br>
<p>
In conclusion, I think genius level intelligence and creativity are<br>
learned behaviors.  It doesn't take a great genome.  And a great genome<br>
probably doesn't help.<br>

But it's physical attractiveness that's really important anyway!<br>
