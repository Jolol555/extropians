Oh boy!  This will be a must-buy book!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    A home in space need not be the enclosed volume usually described in</i><br>
most movies, <br>
<i>&gt;books and articles. If a strong enough material is used, a rotating</i><br>
cylinder can be so large <br>
<i>&gt;that it holds an entire atmosphere against its inner surface. The only</i><br>
example this author <br>
<i>&gt;knows of is Larry Niven's "Ringworld", a ring the diameter of Earth's</i><br>
orbit, circling a sun, <br>
<i>&gt;and wide enough to contain oceans and continents. It, unfortunately, had to</i><br>
be built of <br>
<i>&gt;"Unobtainium" to perform this mighty feat.</i><br>
<p>
Also, the "Orbitals" appearing in some novels by Iain Banks, "The Player of<br>
Games", "Consider Phlebas", "Use of Weapons" and "Excession".  These are<br>
rings like you describe, but they have a radius chosen so they rotate in one<br>
day and produce one gee on the inside.  This permits a comfy day-night cycle<br>
without the use of mirrors.  My calculations indicate they have a radius of<br>
1.9 million kilometers, and a tangential velocity of 21.8 km/sec.  In the<br>
books, they're built of Unobtanium, but they might not have to be!  Pure<br>
diamond is restricted to a tangential velocity of 17.5 km/sec; buckyfiber<br>
may be capable of 21.8 km/sec (I haven't done that calculation).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     "Carbon Fiber" (also mis-named </i><br>
<i>&gt;"Graphite Fiber") </i><br>
<p>
It's a fiber consisting of pure graphite, i.e. carbon.  How is this a misnomer?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The shell needs to be about three meters thick for structural reasons, </i><br>
<p>
Is that counting the dirt, trees, etc that one will want spread across the<br>
interior?  If not, how thick are you assuming these amenities are?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and another three </i><br>
<i>&gt;meters of slag should be sprayed on the outside, for radiation protection.</i><br>
<p>
Why spin the slag?  Put it in a nonrotating shell well away from the<br>
cylinder, and you save big on structural mass.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As this is an "open-air" design, the ends only have to come up from the</i><br>
cylinder wall <br>
<i>&gt;about 150 kilometers, and can be very thin near the top, as will be the</i><br>
enclosed <br>
<i>&gt;atmosphere. </i><br>
<p>
That gives an atmospheric half-life of only 60,000 years.  Why not make the<br>
wall a little higher?  You get a factor of ten in half-life for every 10 km<br>
of height.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The interior volume of this world can be left open to space, meaning</i><br>
each point on the <br>
<i>&gt;interior living surface has about 150 Km of atmosphere above it, and then</i><br>
700 Km of <br>
<i>&gt;nothing. Looking upward, at an angle, one can still see the stars.</i><br>
<p>
It will be very bright at night, with a 28 degree wide arch of sunlit land<br>
spread across the sky.  The stars will be too dim to be seen.  This is an<br>
argument for a narrower ring, or perhaps some sort of parasol (sleep mask?).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   That was a lot of work, but what is a World worth?</i><br>
<p>
About ten trillion dollars, if you're trying to sell it to present-day<br>
Americans.  If you're trying to sell it in the future, who knows?  Land<br>
might be dirt cheap.<br>
