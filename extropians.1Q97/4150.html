I don't like bad science fiction where the evil computer is intelligent but  <br>
can not feel, even in Star Trek only the humans have proper emotions, <br>
the alien Mr. Spok could never quite figure them out. Considering Evolution's  <br>
experience in building such things, you could make a much stronger case that  <br>
a computer, or any alien form of life, might be able to feel emotions but it  <br>
could never be intelligent.<br>
<p>
Nature found it much easier to come up with feeling than the ability to <br>
reason, it's certainly came up with it first. The most ancient part of the <br>
brain, the spinal cord, the medulla and the pons is similar to the brain of <br>
a fish or amphibian and first made an appearance on the earth about <br>
400 million years ago. According to Paul MacLean of the National Institute of<br>
Mental Health it deals in aggressive behavior, territoriality and social <br>
hierarchies. <br>
<p>
The Limbic System is about 150 million years old and ours is similar to that <br>
found in other mammals. Some think the Limbic system is the source of awe and <br>
exhilaration because it is the active sight of many psychotropic drugs, <br>
there's little doubt that the amygdala, a part of the Limbic system has much <br>
to do with fear. After some animals developed a Limbic system they started to <br>
spend much more time taking care of their young, so it probably has something <br>
to do with love too. <br>
<p>
It is our grossly enlarged neocortex that makes the human brain so unusual <br>
and so recent, it only started to get ridiculously large about 3 million <br>
years ago. It deals in deliberation, spatial perception, speaking, reading, <br>
writing and mathematics, the one new emotion we got was worry, probably <br>
because the neocortex is also the place where we plan for the future.    <br>
If nature came up with feeling first and intelligence much later, I don't see <br>
why the opposite would be true for our computers. It's probably a hell of a <br>
lot easier to make something that feels but doesn't think than something that <br>
thinks but doesn't feel.                      <br>
