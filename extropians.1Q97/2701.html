I just got this from a friend on the pigdog list, who tells me that<br>
AP released it yesterday (96/2/17). It looks legit to me, so I'm<br>
forwarding it without checking the background or source. Just<br>
another bit of scare-story for space activists to use to attract<br>
people's attention (sounds cynical, but I think it's a good thing).<br>

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists who drilled core samples from the ocean bed<br>
said Sunday they have found proof that a huge asteroid smashed into the<br>
Earth 65 million years ago and probably killed off the dinosaurs. <br>
<p>
"We've got the smoking gun," said Richard D. Norris, leader of an<br>
international ocean drilling expedition that probed the Atlantic Ocean<br>
floor in search of asteroid evidence. "It is proof positive of the<br>
impact." <br>
<p>
Norris said the expedition recovered three drill samples that have the<br>
unmistakable signature of an asteroid impact about 65 million years ago.<br>
The drill cores include a thin brownish section that the scientists called<br>
the "fireball layer" because it is thought to contain bits of the asteroid<br>
itself.<br>
<p>
'It is proof positive' "These neat layers of sediment bracketing the<br>
impact have never been found in the sea before," Norris said in a<br>
telephone interview.  "It is proof positive of the impact." <br>
<p>
The scientists, working on the drill ship Joides Resolution, spent five<br>
weeks off the east coast of Florida collecting cores from the ocean floor<br>
in about 8,500 feet of water. The team penetrated up to 300 feet beneath<br>
the sea bed, drilling past sediments laid down at the time of the dinosaur<br>
extinction. <br>
<p>
Norris said the deepest layers contain fossil remains of many animals and<br>
came from a healthy "happy-go-lucky ocean" just before the impact. <br>
<p>
Just above this is a layer with small green glass pebbles, thought to be<br>
ocean bottom material instantly melted by the massive energy release of<br>
the impact. <br>
<p>
Next was a rusty brown layer which Norris said is thought to be from the<br>
"vaporized remains of the asteroid itself." <br>
<p>
The heat of the impact would have been so intense, said Norris, that the<br>
stony asteroid would have instantly been reduced to vapor and thrown high<br>
into the sky, some of it perhaps even reaching outer space. It then snowed<br>
down, like a fine powder, all over the globe. Norris said brown deposits,<br>
like that in the core sample, have been found elsewhere and they have a<br>
high content of iridium, a chemical signature of asteroids. <br>
<p>
Just above the brown layer, is two inches of gray clay with strong<br>
evidence of a nearly dead world. <br>
<p>
"It was not a completely dead ocean, but most of the species that are seen<br>
before (early in the core sample) are gone," said Norris.  "There are just<br>
some very minute fossils. These were the survivors in the ocean." <br>
<p>
This dead zone lasted about 5,000 years, said the scientist, and then the<br>
core samples showed evidence of renewed life. <br>
<p>
"It is amazing how quickly the new species appeared," he said. <br>
<p>
Although the dinosaur-killing impact occurred in the southern Gulf of<br>
Mexico, Norris went to the Atlantic Ocean, near the edge of the<br>
Continental Shelf. He said that the violence of the impact, followed by<br>
huge waves, roiled the Gulf of Mexico so much that it is unlikely clear<br>
core samples would be found there. <br>
<p>
He said he theorized that waves from the impact would have washed<br>
completely across Florida, depositing debris in the Atlantic. And that's<br>
where he found it. <br>
<p>
'The most significant discovery' in 20 years<br>
<p>
Robert W. Corell, assistant director for Geosciences of the National<br>
Science Foundation, said the core samples are the strongest evidence yet<br>
that an asteroid impact caused the extinction. <br>
<p>
"In my view, this is the most significant discovery in geosciences in 20<br>
years," he said, also in a telephone interview. "This gives us the facts<br>
of what happened to life back then. I would certainly call it the smoking<br>
gun." <br>
<p>
Geologist Walter Alvarez of the University of California, Berkeley, first<br>
proposed in 1980 that the dinosaurs disappeared from fossil history<br>
suddenly because of a massive asteroid hit. At first, the theory had few<br>
supporters. <br>
<p>
But in 1989, scientists found evidence of a huge impact crater north of<br>
Chicxulub, on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Later studies found evidence of<br>
debris washed out of the Gulf by waves that went inland as far as what is<br>
now Arkansas. <br>
<p>
It's now widely believed that an asteroid of 6 to 12 miles in diameter<br>
smashed into Earth at thousands of miles per hour. It instantly gouged a<br>
crater 150 to 180 miles wide. <br>
<p>
That energy release was more powerful than if all of the nuclear weapons<br>
ever made were set off at once, said Norris. <br>
<p>
Billions of tons of soil, sulfur and rock vapor were lifted into the<br>
atmosphere, blotting out the sun. Temperatures around the globe plunged. <br>
<p>
Up to 70 percent of all species, including the dinosaurs, perished.  Among<br>
the survivors, scientists believe, were small mammals that, over millions<br>
of years, evolved into many new species, including humans. <br>
