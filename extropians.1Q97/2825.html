This may be assuming genetic factors play a much-much larger role than<br>
environmental factors.  I might suggest that given the opportunity to<br>
develop as freely as possible (given the circumstances), a clone may<br>
develop along a completely different path than its predecessor.  In<br>
fact, it may develop along a completely different path if others try to<br>
mold it;  I.e. it will never have the same experiences as its former.<br>
<p>
Of course, we have now have the key to determining which of these<br>
arguments is correct. . .<br>
