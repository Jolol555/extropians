<i>&gt;geniuses that made them excell.  I think we all have the same basic equipment </i><br>
<i>&gt;and that we can all take it to at least the same level of quality that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;geniuses do.  I also believe that they could have taken their abilities much </i><br>
<i>&gt;further than they did, especially if they had been working together with other </i><br>
<i>&gt;geniuses, for that purpose. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;The point is that I had much more potential than I really imagined a few </i><br>
<i>&gt;years ago, and much more potential than I had any evidence to support my </i><br>
<i>&gt;belief in.  ... Most people aren't really </i><br>
<i>&gt;even *trying* to become smarter, especially since most people have the belief </i><br>
<i>&gt;that their intelligence is set on a certain level.  Typical humans are not </i><br>
<i>&gt;encouraged to think deeply or to regularly solve difficult and complex </i><br>
<i>&gt;problems.  People are simply not doing the excercises required to develop </i><br>
<i>&gt;genius.  This is why I believe they are far below their true potential. </i><br>

Yes, your personal experience indicates that some of the variation in<br>
people's "genius" is explained by their training.  But you just can't<br>
conclude from this that proper training would make the typical human<br>
far greater than Newton.  There doesn't need to be anything<br>
"magically" different about people to make this false - just something<br>
different.  It could be lots of things, including their basic ambition<br>
level, whether they happened to stumble on a fundamental insight, or a<br>
some basic "processing speed".   I wish what you say were true, but<br>
wishing don't make it so.  <br>
