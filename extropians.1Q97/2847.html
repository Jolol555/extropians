If you have access to the _Washington Post_, check out page D5, Style <br>
Section, article entitled 'The Mind Gym'.  It describes a series of <br>
exercises that are being used with young children to increase mental <br>
capabilities, and they also have applications for adults.  The <br>
exercises are organized according to the mental function in need of <br>
strenghtening, such as memory or data processing.  For instance, <br>
rhythm and timing exercises can improve math abilities.  It is also <br>
suggested that drinking sufficient water and moving around throughout <br>
the day can help increase all mental skills.<br>
<p>
I have seen this movement therapy work in amazing fashion for a friend <br>
who deals with severe dyslexia -- that person is in grad school now.<br>
<p>
A book is also mentioned:  _Smart Moves, Why Learning is Not All in <br>
Your Head_ by neuropsychologist Carla Hannaford.<br>
