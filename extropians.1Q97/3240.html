Such schemes have been tried before, although the digital twist is a new<br>
one to me.  The perrenial problem has been the temptation to make lots<br>
of currency, resulting in inflation.  They have to have the ability to<br>
make some currency for each new participant, otherwise stagnation occurs.<br>
So they therefore have the ability to wreck their own economy through<br>
inflation.  Such a misdeed can be very profitable for them since they <br>
are the first to spend the new currency.<br>
<p>
In short, they have means and they have motive.  What guarantees to <br>
they offer on their money supply?<br>
