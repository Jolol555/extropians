Alcoa's dominance of aluminum processing.  Programmers can split up and<br>
freewheel (Microsoft?  Economy of scale in advertising...) and mail<br>

companies.  Billion dollar plant costs bite.  Nanotech might change<br>
that, but it's not too immediate.  <br>

Note that food production is an even more necessary manipulation of<br>
physical realtiy, but much fragmentation and competition is possible and<br>
present there, so farmers don't run the world.<br>

        A priest was walking along the cliffs at Dover when he came<br>
upon two locals pulling another man ashore on the end of a rope.  "That's<br>
what I like to see" said the priest, "A man helping his fellow man."<br>
        As he was walking away, one local remarked to the other, "Well,<br>
he sure doesn't know the first thing about shark fishing."<br>
