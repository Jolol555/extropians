Yes, The National Governements claim to shrink their power, by shifting<br>
responsabilities to the European council, to provincial govt's, and to<br>
cities/communities (and in some cases federal govt to national govts like<br>
in belgium, which has recently become a federal state incorporating two<br>
seperate countries.) Instead it's just more people raising more taxes<br>
(especially local, city taxes). They have even come up with "Euregional"<br>
bodies, (overlapping national borders) i wonder what their infuence will<br>
be. Europe is consolidating it's internal political power, problem is that<br>
many national govt's are struggling not to give theirs up, where some<br>
regional govt's are taking their chance, and are stimulating all kinds of<br>
long forgotten local nationalism (Italy, Belgium etc, ) so for the next 25<br>
years or so, we'll have at least two or three large institutions sucking us<br>
dry...<br>
<p>
In any case there's a real power transformation going on here. A united<br>
Europe will probably realize itself, but a few national govt's may be able<br>
to hang on to their power and cede, whereas some local nationalist<br>
movements might form their own state, either within or outside the European<br>
community...<br>
<p>
My guess is a true European State, is another century or so away, when<br>
everybody has learned to speak English, (or german ?).<br>
<p>
question is, what will happen to those poor remaining monarchs ? ;-)<br>
