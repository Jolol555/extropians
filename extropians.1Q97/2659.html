<i>        &gt;Our government truly does provoke violence. We sold Suddham Hussein         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;many of his weapons. </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
You put me in the very unusual position of defending the government of the  <br>
USA. Suddham's weapons were made in the USSR, France and China, I can't think <br>
of any major weapon system that was made in America.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Our government supplies drugs to inner cities. This has been         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reported in many newspapers lately. </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
You will have to look long and hard to find somebody who has more contempt <br>
for "our" government or any government than me, but that accusation is made <br>
in many of the same newspapers that report on alien UFO abductions and crying <br>
statues, and is just about as reliable. Government commits enough real life <br>
horrors, there is no need to invent them.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>         &gt;We would reduce a great deal of violence by:       </i><br>
<i>         &gt;1. Make drugs of all kinds legal.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Agreed. We should also be able to buy any medicine without a prescription.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;2. Stop selling and/or giving arms to third world countries.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Don't give them away certainly, but if somebody has the money it will be very <br>
difficult to stop them from getting any weapon they want. I worry a lot about <br>
the tens of thousands of H-bombs in the former USSR and the fact that the <br>
people in charge of their security make the equivalent of 50$ a month.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;3. The United States should cease intervening in the affairs of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;other countries entirely.    </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That would be a good start, after that if we could get the government to quit <br>
intervening in domestic affairs too then things would be great.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;4. Add emotive education in our public and private schools.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Just get rid of public schools and let private schools do as they please.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;5. Take 3/4 of the unbelievable sum we spend on the military and use           </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that for personalized criminal reform rather than sending people to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;prisons as they exist today. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I have a better idea, give the money back to the people the government stole  <br>
it from and let the individual decide how best to spend it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Lets stop putting people in an environment which only magnifies         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;their violent urges. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It would be different if we knew how to engineer a personality, then we could <br>
get rid of the violent urges in even the worst criminal, but we don't and <br>
there is no point in pretending that we do. No matter how much money you <br>
throw at the problem, prison will always be a dreadful environment because <br>
we're putting bad people where they don't want to be. We concentrate the most<br>
horrible monsters we can find on this planet into one tiny area, make sure <br>
they can't leave and then expect them to reform. That is not realistic.<br>
<p>
Prisons are only good for two things, to warehouse criminals so they can't <br>
commit violent crimes in the outside world, and as a deterrent. Time works in <br>
our favor, for reasons not well understood people tend to become less violent <br>
when they get older.<br>
