[John K Clark corrects:]<br>
<i>&gt; Actually, Bell's inequality has been experimentally proven to be false, </i><br>
<i>&gt; just as quantum mechanics predicted and contrary to what classical physics </i><br>
<i>&gt; or any local theory predicts.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, yeah, you know what I mean.  I mean that "The conclusion drawn<br>
from the thought experiment known as "Bell's inequality", that there are<br>
no inequalities, has been experimentally confirmed."  Slip of the<br>
keyboard.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Relativity doesn't say that nothing can go faster than light, only that </i><br>
<i>&gt; matter, energy or information can not, and this is none of those things.</i><br>
<p>
You and William Seager.  Quantum collapse is "noncausal but<br>
information-laden", says Seager.  Relativistic constraint only applies<br>
to causality, not information.  Or maybe it's the other way around?  You<br>
should read his "Consciousness, Information, &amp; Panpsychism" sometime. <br>
He also uses reasoning that seems pretty similar to that flowchart of<br>
consciousness you drew once.<br>
<p>
I must say that I find rather attractive the idea that you can exert a<br>
causal influence without transmitting information.  (For various<br>
reasons, I prefer to reverse Seager's conclusion.)  *Even if you can use<br>
it to communicate, you can still argue that you're not really<br>
transmitting information.  You're only influencing probability<br>
amplitudes; the quantum collapse itself disrupts the causal continuity<br>
of the information by interposing a random, fundamentally non-causal<br>
event.*  [Idea in asterisks my own.]  As an explanation, it has the aura<br>
of inexplicable but internally consistent weirdness that often<br>
characterizes the truth about basic physical reality.<br>
