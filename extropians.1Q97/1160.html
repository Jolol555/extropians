Nice ad hominem mockery. Here's one recently posted by James Rogers:<br>
Lockheed engineers are apparently taking the new Zero Point Field<br>
theories of Puthoff and Raisch seriously enough that they think they can<br>
figure out how to use the ZPF in a way to realize Alcubierre's<br>
theoretical Warp Drive that he posited in 1952, as a method of traveling<br>
faster than light without violating relativity, or at least traveling<br>
through space MUCH more cheaply than at present, so cheap that most<br>
people, if they knew about Lockheed's work, would scoff at them for<br>
thinking they can violate the "laws of physics".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it happened with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the Wright Bros., when the head of the Smithsonian Institution had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; previously said that heavier than air flight was impossible, it happened</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with Robert Goddard, when "experts" said that rocket engines would not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; work in a vacuum,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here's another one: 'they' always said that we couldn't travel faster than</i><br>
<i>&gt; sound.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And guess what... all those claims were true in a limited engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense (there were problems that would be hard to solve), but contradicted</i><br>
<i>&gt; the laws of physics as they were known at the time. Rockets could</i><br>
<i>&gt; obviously work in a vacuum if supplied with oxidiser, heavier than air</i><br>
<i>&gt; flight simply required light enough materials, and bullets had been</i><br>
<i>&gt; travelling faster than sound for decades; in fact, the V2 had done so in</i><br>
<i>&gt; WWII, though that was probably classified. As absolute claims they were</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply wrong, and any reasonable physicist could have shown why.</i><br>
<p>
They did not violate the laws of physics as known at the time. They<br>
violated the misconceptions about the laws of physics as known at the<br>
time. A rocket does NOT need oxidizer to work in a vacuum (as the ESA<br>
whether their hydrazine thrusters have oxidizer) the misperception was<br>
that thrust was developed by exhaust gasses pushing against the<br>
atmosphere surrounding the rocket, rather than simply a matter of the<br>
difference in pressure between the front and rear of the device (kind of<br>
like my drive, eh?). Goddard was derided for "violating" the same "laws"<br>
as I am derided now, yet who now has a firm place in history?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Frankly I am surprised than anyone on this list would not have learned</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from such recent history.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is nothing impossible about wiping out life on Earth from the moon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You just build yourself some kind of total conversion generator (you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; do that with a black hole, right?) to convert lunar soil into energy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; use that to launch millions of thousand ton rocks towards the Earth at 50</i><br>
<i>&gt; km/s.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is impossible is doing so in the kind of small-scale scenarios that</i><br>
<i>&gt; we've been talking about, because it contravenes fundamental laws of</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics such as conservation of energy. None of the predictions that</i><br>
<i>&gt; people always bring up to defend such claims contravene these laws.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         Mark</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Like I said Mark, it only contravenes YOUR conceptions of the<br>
"fundamental laws of physics", mainly because, as evidenced by your<br>
scenario building and debunking, you seem to always choose your<br>
assumptions by how they will most benefit your own preconceived opinion.<br>
That is hardly the scientific method.<br>
