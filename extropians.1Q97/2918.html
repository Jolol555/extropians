Genetic replica.  Brain stem development should be suppressable.  No<br>
brain, no person.  Actually letting the body grow under total sensory<br>
deprivation would probably also prevent any mental development --<br>
important experiment -- but people would probably be happier if the<br>
brain was obviously gone.  Actually people won't be happy at all, but<br>
convincing them would be easier with physical removal or suppressing.<br>

Holy Wood!...was that special sort of beautiful area which is only<br>
beautiful if you can leave after briefly admiring its beauty and go<br>
somewhere else where there are hot tubs and cold drinks.  Actually<br>
staying there for any length of time is a penance. -- _Moving Pictures_<br>
