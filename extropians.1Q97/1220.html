Re: MEMES: superstitions<br>
Lee Daniel Crocker (lcrocker@calweb.com) replied:<br>
<i>&gt;Superstition, myth, aphorisms, dogma, and the like /are/ successful.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Even as an unwavering advocate of reason, I can see their value in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;few contexts: </i><br>
<i>&gt;* Teaching children how to behave in terms they can understand </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and use while they're in the process of learning why; </i><br>
<i>&gt;* To supply shortcuts, rules of thumb, that can be used to make timely</i><br>
<i>&gt;  decisions about newly-encountered situations when there isn't time </i><br>
<i>&gt;  for rigorous analysis; </i><br>
<i>&gt;* To provide examples (in the form of myths) to explain principles.</i><br>
<p>
 The focus on effect is good, but a 'deceptive' causal explanation <br>
 could be counter-productive down the road.  It's a gamble that <br>
 sometimes 'pays' and sometimes doesn't.  Such memes have high value of<br>
 effectiveness, but not as high a value of rendering understanding.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So why not create extropian myths, aphorisms, holidays, idioms?  In</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact, the resistance to do so might give us the false impression that</i><br>
<i>&gt;those we create inadvertantly have more meaning than they do.</i><br>
<p>
 On one hand, there is much gained by solidifying vision through symbols<br>
 and abstractions of cause and effect.  On the other hand, the <br>
 'competing gods' syndrome is what creates the greatest faults in<br>
 the Christ legend.  (Jesus/Y'shua himself said 'Why do you call me <br>
 good? None is good but the Father.'  Yet, people EQUATED him to the<br>
 Father, against his intentions.)<br>
<p>
 Perhaps we're already on the right path there... We villify Entropy, <br>
 even though it can have some place outside of Extropy.  We deify<br>
 Spontaneous Order, even though it might allow for harmful complexity<br>
 or stiffling stability.  Singularity sounds remarkably adventist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I must say, though, that I find not a single thing worthwhile about</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jesus's teachings at all.  He is the classic self-sacrificial altruist,</i><br>
<p>
 Altruism is a mixed bag.  It is the ultimate discipline to have the<br>
 self control over one's choices to execute perfect actions while <br>
 overriding mortal fear.  The judgemental Church still doesn't <br>
 understand just how great it is that he didn't 'take personal' his <br>
 own murderous execution. On the other hand, it seems to me that few <br>
 extropians would have respect of a decission to let principle permit <br>
 such a death, if that was ever his intent.  <br>
 (Read on about his so-called 'death.')<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;mindlessly vengeful (e.g., the fig tree), </i><br>
<p>
 ...a 'competing gods' legend borrowed from Hinduism...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;praising "faith" (mysticism and uncritical acceptance of dogma),</i><br>
<p>
 There's another Church-perverted term... The word "Faith" never meant<br>
 "blind belief" but rather "Commitment."  (Faithful to marriage, faithful<br>
 to contracts...)  It was recognized that such faith prerequired a certain<br>
 amount of trust, but when trust was questioned, the Church later <br>
 oversimplified it down to belief.<br>
<p>
 The extropian counterpart would be 'Self-Confidence,' which is just<br>
 as easy to criticize, yet no less valued.  It too can move mountains.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"hope" (begging for supernatural favors instead of working </i><br>
<i>&gt;to better yourself), </i><br>
<p>
 Hope is much better than Hopelessness as long as it's not misplaced.<br>
 Ironically, the only two things that Jesus would pray about were<br>
 natural providence (daily bread), and self-fulfilling matters (forgiveness,<br>
 praise, and workers for the field...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and "charity" (self-sacrifice and self-loathing).  </i><br>
<p>
 True, one of his most misplaced (or misinterperated?) instructions was to <br>
 take up one's cross.  Could it be that people misunderstood the irony with<br>
 which he spoke that?:  In seeking one's life they lose it, but in giving <br>
 one's life they find it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;He was anti-capitalist ("camel through the needle's eye..."), </i><br>
<i>&gt;pro-government ("render unto Caesar..."). </i><br>
<p>
 If he says to pay your dues to Caesar and teaches the value of coins, <br>
 he can hardly be called "anti-capitalist."  Non-capitalist perhaps,<br>
 he indicates that there are many greater values in a human economy.<br>
 He said 'it is *greater* to give than to recieve,' but not 'worthless <br>
 to receive.'<br>
<p>
 As for the Caesar bit, I thought this exhibits genius:<br>
 It's a funny punchline to a bitter issue of taxation.<br>
 It is the most simple and eliquent solution as to the issues of<br>
 justice that divided a people.<br>
 "Give Caesar what is Caesar's, Give God what is God's."<br>
 It is one of history's first documented lessons in Appropriate Scale vs.<br>
 Totalitarianism... a lesson we are only now gaining in firm grasp as<br>
 we move from a bigger-is-better industrial era to the information age.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To hell with him, I'll pick my own heroes.  "And yea, Feynmann </i><br>
<i>&gt;said unto his students..."</i><br>
<p>
 Yes we will all value different role models... It will be difficult<br>
 to find one that would be undebatable until someone *really* comes<br>
 along who can put an end to death.<br>
<p>
 The Church has covered up much evidence that Jesus NEVER REALLY DIED on<br>
 the cross.  This is spoken of in the Quran, that 'he was never killed, <br>
 but the Jews merely *thought* that they had killed him.'  The Shroud <br>
 of Turin, if found authentic, corroberates this as well.  The most damning<br>
 evidence is in the Bible itself: That the spear caused blood and water to<br>
 come pouring out his side.  This would not be the case of a man whose heart <br>
 had supposedly stopped moments before.  (For those who have an interest<br>
 in this, check out the book "The Jesus Conspiracy.")  He may have even gone <br>
 into his fate with the assurance of resuscitation.<br>
<p>
 This is a unique century that will uncover a great number of historic<br>
 discrepancies regarding the Bible.  Just over fifty years ago were the <br>
 Dead Sea Scrolls uncovered, and they don't corroberate everthing they<br>
 were expected to.  Post-King-James revisions omit entire chapters that<br>
 are not true to earlier manuscripts.  'Apocryphal' books and gospels<br>
 show a side to Jesus never seen before.  (I for one love 'The Gospel of<br>
 Thomas,' most likely omitted for its equality of sexes.)<br>
<p>
 I will not worship a Christ legend, but I do find many praiseworthy<br>
 characteristics to the historic Y'shua.  A humorist and healer,<br>
 he was 'deified' without his wishes.  His fellow jews prefered the<br>
 judgemental vigilance of his cousin John the Baptist.  But Jesus<br>
 was a party-loving contrast to John:  <br>
       "For John the Baptist came neither eating bread <br>
        nor drinking wine, and you say, `He has a demon.' <br>
        The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you <br>
        say, `Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a<br>
        friend of tax collectors and "sinners."' <br>
        But wisdom is proved right by all her children." Luke 7:33-35<br>
<p>
 I don't have totalitarian views of forcing the world to worship him.<br>
 (Neither did Jesus... When he said to go baptizing into all the world,<br>
 he was talking about purifying people through bathing, not building<br>
 Synagogs of indoctrination!)  But if Wisdom is proved right by all <br>
 her children, then I will likely share in the admiration of your heroes, <br>
 whether or not you value mine.<br>
<p>
 I for one gotta admire a guy who teaches his fellow Jews to be more <br>
 accepting and tollerant of each other, working to bring humor and healing<br>
 to everyone around him. (Whew! That was some load off my chest!)<br>
