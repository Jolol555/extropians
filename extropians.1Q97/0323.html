<i>&gt;So what sort of motivations did you have in mind for uploading? I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;honestly curious.</i><br>
<p>
As uploaded entertainment I will enjoy satisfying my God ego having legions<br>
of AI peasants kneeling before me, consuming great wealths of inspiring<br>
knowledge, and exploring incredibly detailed worlds beyond my wildest<br>
dreams. It WILL be cool. Basically I want to live in the Sunken Ship level<br>
of Super Mario64. :)<br>
(Just got N64, incredible graphics I might add, I find the environments in<br>
it the ideal example of how art in an uploaded or virtual world will be.)<br>
Start designing your fantasy environments now because anything designed in<br>
virtual reality can be easily ported to uploaded reality. If you jot down<br>
some ideas on paper today and continue to add detail and start designing<br>
them on a PC, when the tools become more user-friendly and processing power<br>
becomes cheaper you will be able to design these dream worlds which you<br>
will someday live in as an uploaded being. I see being in an uploaded world<br>
akin to living the life of Ghen in the book "Myst: The Book of Atrus" which<br>
is a prequel to the game "Myst" and explains in depth the civilization that<br>
created the island of Myst and how they would 'write' things into reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;While many in this "Machine Stops" world are fully satisfactory with</i><br>
<i>&gt;telepresence, I am not, except when unavoidable, for the important</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences. Some would say that having a camera link is the same as</i><br>
<i>&gt;having a link to your own eyes, but I say nay for now. Skiing knee deep</i><br>
<i>&gt;powder at Alta live and in person is nothing like anything telepresence</i><br>
<i>&gt;would offer. IF you think otherwise, prove me wrong. Telepresence and</i><br>
<i>&gt;other remote sensing technologies are great for expanding ones sensory</i><br>
<i>&gt;awareness, but for now cannot replace one's existing awareness. Sure</i><br>
<i>&gt;having remote probes to do advance scouting are great, especially when</i><br>
<i>&gt;exploring space, at least in the sense of reducing risks and maximizing</i><br>
<i>&gt;time utility by culling out negative possibilities (i.e. stars with no</i><br>
<i>&gt;planets, etc), but they will not replace actually setting your own foot</i><br>
<i>&gt;down on an alien beach, meeting alien life forms in person, or skiing</i><br>
<i>&gt;ammonia glaciers on the moons of gas giants....</i><br>
<p>
Thats easy! Build genengineered drones for the particular environment with<br>
brain boxes you can upload into so you can experience it firsthand. Just<br>
because you're an upload doesn't mean you're forced to leave the body. You<br>
can have any body you want. The likelyhood is that we will never leave the<br>
physical world for a very long time because we need macroscopic engineering<br>
still. You could genengineer these biological drones to be or look however<br>
you want and flip between the virtual and physical seamlessly. We will need<br>
to sacrifice nothing! You can keep your old body Mike, alter it in anyway<br>
you wish or keep it as it is, but you will also be able to flip between<br>
reality and virtuality effortlessly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Another variation:- John Varley wrote a short story about someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;vacationing as a lion.  The personality is downloaded into a controller</i><br>
<i>&gt;implant in the lion's brain (I think, or I might have just made that up).</i><br>
<i>&gt; The life of a lion, with the proprioceptive feedback of a lion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; simplifies the thoughts in a meditative kind of way.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly what I'm talking about!<br>
