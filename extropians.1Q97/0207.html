Try to rein in those amazing generalizations, there, Eliezer.<br>
<p>
Some schools, perhaps many schools, take this attitude.  Far too many<br>
schools, particularly at the lower levels, take this attitude for my<br>
personal comfort and I've railed about the public school systems of<br>
Chicago more than you can possibly imagine.<br>
<p>
But not all schools are like this.  <br>
<p>
My high school, a private school, was not like this.  They failed and<br>
expelled people when their standards were not met.  It was for this<br>
reason that I chose to go to that high school, and saddled my parents<br>
with the expense.<br>
<p>
And my university experience was not like that either.  Toward the end<br>
of my graduate career, when I was invovled in teaching people, myself,<br>
I personally acted as the left hand of Father Darwin, and removed a<br>
number of people from the academic gene pool, when they proved incapable<br>
or unwilling to learn the required material for the course.<br>
<p>
So please stop making unqualified generalizations.<br>
