<i>&gt;&gt;The main trouble is that the British can't cook.</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, silly, it's EC farm policy -- less diverse food at higher prices.</i><br>
That's so true. I remember the look on my (socialist) girlfriends face <br>
when I first took her round a good US supermarket. Massive variety, <br>
higher quality, and lower prices. It was even open *when 9-5 people <br>
weren't at work*, which was almost unknown in the UK back then. <br>
Meanwhile, the EU issues directives on how much we should pay farmers for <br>
not farming land, while at the same time setting penalties for letting <br>
non-farmed land become inhabited by meadowflowers and songbirds. And <br>
don't get me started on the Fisheries (or total destruction thereof) <br>
Policy. I'm beginning to despair of this continent. My dynamic optimism <br>
is flagging...<br>
