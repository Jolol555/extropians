Unfortunately (because as a frequent flyer I'd prefer to believe that some<br>
idiot in the Navy shot it down than that 747s sometimes just blow up for<br>
no good reason) I have to agree with Hal. Looking at the images on their<br>
Web site the two circled dots clearly come very close to each other, and if<br>
one were TWA800 I'd probably accept the missile theory. However, the dot<br>
marked as TWA800 never seems to come within a couple of miles of the<br>
supposed missile. Or perhaps that should be "the dot which appears to be <br>
marked as TWA800," since the number is hard to read.<br>
<p>
OTOH, given the FBI's massive over-reaction I wonder if I've missed<br>
something... One question I have is whether a modern traffic control radar<br>
could actually pick up an anti-aircraft missile? I was under the <br>
impression that they now rely more on the aircraft's transponder replying<br>
when painted by the radar than on the returns from the radar itself.<br>
