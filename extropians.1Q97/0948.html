True, but it's just as 'lucky' an accident that other species didn't develop<br>
intelligence. Any omnivorous species with smalll gestation size, and<br>
relatively long gestation time, theoretically could have. It was 'lucky'<br>
that pre-homonids developed it, and not some other species with a similar<br>
function in the ecosystem.  <br>

<p>
<i>&gt;True, but there were plenty of other large fast carnivores, like the ancestor  </i><br>
<i>&gt;of lions and saber tooth tigers.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
which ancestor of lions and sabertooth tiger ? name one big cat who lived 5<br>
million years ago in africa !<br>
<p>
Australopithicus Afarensis 4-5 mln years ago<br>
Various Smilodon (sabertooth species) -&gt; not in africa, only in america !<br>
<p>
Homo Habilis/erectus (who used tools) 2mln years ago<br>
Various Acinonyx species (cheetah like solitary hunter) only distributed<br>
over the world between 3-1 million years ago.  <br>
<p>
Panthera atrox, the direct ancestor of the lion, who hunted in groups, never<br>
developed until the time of homo erectus, and could be fought off with<br>
spears and tools.<br>
<p>
that leaves a very 'grey' area of discussion of about 1 million years (3-2<br>
mln years ago) where a stupid, small and just developed acinonix species<br>
might have preyed on a DESCENDANT of Afarensis who was 2 million years in<br>
development already (2mln years in development BEYOND lucy, 1 mln years away<br>
from Habilis), and probably had aquired more brain volume, use of primitive<br>
tools etc.  <br>
<p>
On this 'grey' period:<br>
<p>
Acinonyx species are generally smaller in body size/weight than panthera<br>
species, and like smilodon, they were nowhere near as intelligent or as<br>
sophisticated hunters as modern big cats (including modern acinonix: the<br>
cheetah). Smilodon and early acinonyx, were stupid cats!<br>
<p>
You were putting up chimps against modern predators, not prehistoric<br>
homonids against prehistoric predators !<br>
<p>
You were giving the ancestors of the modern big cats (panthera species<br>
(tiger, lion) hadn't evolved yet) the qualities of their current<br>
equivalents, and put them up against Afarensis. Allthough i agree that<br>
hominids use their intelligence more than big cats, and the danger acynonix<br>
posed to LATE Afarensis was probably greater than the danger that modern big<br>
cats pose to modern man, i don't think it EQUALS the danger that MODERN big<br>
cats (ie=Panthera genera) would pose to EARLY Afarensis.  <br>
<p>
again 3 million years ago the first succesful big cat: acinonyx just started<br>
spreading, it found itself matched against a species of Australopithecus who<br>
was 2mln years in development since lucy, and allthough he was no homo<br>
habilis yet, he definitly was no chimp, whereas acynonix definitely was no<br>
modern cheetah, let alone tiger or lion !!!<br>
                                     <br>
Again, more dangrous to Afarensis would have been hyenids, ofcourse also<br>
underdeveloped, and not to be compared with todays hyena species, but they<br>
hunt in packs, were not much smaller than acynonix, and in my opinion they<br>
were the predator that 'aided' homonid evolution.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is not a particle of evidence that Australopithecus Afarensis engaged </i><br>
<i>&gt;in hunting of any sort, but yes, it must have had some method of dealing with </i><br>
<i>&gt;predators, because despite being slow and weak and having no tools, Lucy's  </i><br>
<i>&gt;kind not only survived they thrived. The mystery is why.</i><br>
<p>
mystery solved: acinonyx was a kitten and hyenas can't climb trees ;-)<br>
