             <br>
<i>       &gt;It's brain is dripping off the wall and it is not dead?</i><br>
<i>       &gt;Do you want to retract that?</i><br>
<p>
I have been known to retract things from time to time, but only when it is <br>
clear I am wrong and No, I most certainly do not want to retract anything.  <br>
I never said that a brain didn't die, I said nobody died.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;All objects are processes.</i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
That's debatable, Moravec things so, I'm not sure.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;All processes are objects.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
No. Objects have a position and a momentum and can be destroyed. Where is <br>
arithmetic located? What is the momentum of arithmetic? How could I destroy  <br>
arithmetic?<br>
                <br>
<i>        &gt;If I were to copy my self EXACTLY no thing would happen because two         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;things can not occupy the same position in spacetime.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
No, that's only true for fermions. Two identical bosons, like photons of  <br>
light, can occupy the same position in spacetime but not so for fermions, <br>
The Pauli Exclusion Principle tells us that 2 identical electrons can not be <br>
in the same orbit in an atom. If we didn't know that then we couldn't <br>
understand Chemistry, we wouldn't know why matter is rigid and not infinitely<br>
compressible, and if we didn't know that atoms are interchangeable we <br>
wouldn't understand any of that.<br>
<p>
Imagine what the world would be like if what you say is true. When I look at <br>
you the photons of light coming from your face would collide with photons <br>
coming at right angles to us scrambling them. Vision would be a useless way <br>
to obtain information about the world.<br>

<i>        &gt;If I destroy my post and yours survives they are obviously not the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;same post.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then the only reason I have not convinced you that I am correct is that all <br>
you have seen is a copy of my posts, the originals were much more convincing.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I would like you to prove that a thing does not occupy a unique         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;position in spacetime.</i><br>
          <br>
What is the radius of an electron?<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We need not know for a thing to be.</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Not true if you're talking about a change my consciousness, if the change <br>
is so small that I can't detect it then my consciousness has not changed.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The smallest change is change.        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Do you disagree?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
There is a difference between a small change and a large change.<br>
Do you disagree?<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;[Showing a chart of Fermions and Bosons]        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Am I going to have to disprove all that too?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, and that would just be the start of your problems. If you insist that  <br>
atoms have individuality then you must disprove every bit of that chart and  <br>
do far more too, like explaining why matter is rigid, why Chemistry has the <br>
laws it does, why Biology is possible ...<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If you exchange positions they are still the same distance from each         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;other, so why bother?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
No reason to bother at all if atoms have no individuality, the system would <br>
be unchanged. On the other hand if as you say each atom is different then  <br>
exchanging atoms will change the system. This has been tested experimentally  <br>
many, many times. I'm right, you're wrong.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If I do not know what x is x might be even, odd, or neither.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I was not talking about even or odd integers, I was talking about <br>
even functions F(x) = +F(-x) and <br>
odd functions  F(x) = -F(-x)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How about if I scatch an electron off?</i><br>
<p>
Huh?                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You are saying when the distance between two things is 0 there are         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;not two things.</i><br>
                      <br>
No, I am saying the probability of finding 2 electron, or any Fermion, <br>
zero distance apart is zero.                   <br>
