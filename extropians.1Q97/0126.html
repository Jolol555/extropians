<i>&gt; From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; After sleeping on it, doing some intentional dreamCAD, I decided that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; yes the cars, in an absolute sense are following a Hohmann elliptical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; orbit. However relative to the geosynch and ground stations, since we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are dealing with the earth rotating, they will apear to follow a figure</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; eight path, with the crossover point being that point at which the cars</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; angular velocity is equal to the rotation of the earth. So, this will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; require good timing in geosynch traffic control to prevent car</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; collisions in a high capacity Lorrey Loop.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (-: That's an interesting design technique :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think ballistic cars will literally follow a figure eight</i><br>
<i>&gt; trajectory in the earth's rotational frame of reference, although you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are right that the orbit will have a loop in it.  Rather, it will be more</i><br>
<i>&gt; like a Spirograph pattern, because the orbit will not form a closed loop</i><br>
<i>&gt; when it comes back to Earth.  It will be in a different place because</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Earth has rotated away.  So left to itself the car would continue</i><br>
<i>&gt; back on up, loop again, and come back down, repeatedly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the period of the elliptical orbit had some simple relationship to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the 24-hour rotational period of the Earth, then eventually the ground</i><br>
<i>&gt; station would catch up with the cars again.  But it won't happen on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first orbit.  This suggests that your "ground station" maybe would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be better placed in low earth orbit, otherwise you'll have a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fireballs streaking through the equatorial skies all over the planet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another idea would be to put your high station not in geosynch orbit,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but at whatever altitude gives the Hohmann elliptical trajectory exactly</i><br>
<i>&gt; a 24 hour period.  This way the cars all come back to the ground station,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and you do have your nice figure eight relative to the rotating earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only problem is that the high station's orbit would not be geosynch.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You could have several high stations and time your launches so that one</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be overhead when the cars get there, or you could have the high</i><br>
<i>&gt; station be in a non-inertial orbit, actively thrusting to stay geosynch.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe the thrust requirements would be small enough to be satisfied</i><br>
<i>&gt; by mirrors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hal</i><br>
I'm not sure if I follow your reasoning at the moment....Remember, the<br>
ground station is rotating around the planet ina 24 hour period, as is<br>
the geosynch station. AHHH. actually, instead of being on opposite sides<br>
of the planet, the geosynch would be directly above the ground station.<br>
a car would get ahead of the two ( the relative path would be a O<br>
between the two stations, with the launch phase being the left side and<br>
return phase being the right side, looking down from above the north<br>
pole, now that I remember my Smoke Ring Rules of Living).<br>
<p>
Yes the atmosphere is a problem, but I think that using javelin shaped<br>
vehicles, with power systems on them generating high external EM fields<br>
to the point of ionizing the air around them, would decrease<br>
resistance/sonic booms, etc. If you ionize the air passing the car to a<br>
higher degree than whould be achieved by friction, you effectivley<br>
reduce resistance (drag) as well as surface temperature problems. (a<br>
simple matter of magnetohydrodynamics). Sufficient ionization also can<br>
eliminate sonic shock waves (true).<br>
<p>
WHile having the lower station in LEO would be easier on the cars, its<br>
not a launching system then (the prime goal), and you are hampered in<br>
getting material there to build it. If you build the ground station on<br>
earth first, you just shoot up cars with constrution materials, and<br>
thrusters to insert into GEO and then build the GEO station.<br>
<p>
I personally like the Ecuadorian Andes for a ground station. You could<br>
definitely get those people interested, as they would think they were<br>
rebuilding Atlantis. (old memes into new!!!). Additionally, all that<br>
good ionization will be great for producing high altitude ozone to<br>
rebuild the O3-layer. Also, being in this hemisphere, your geosynch<br>
station would be in a prime position to provide greatly expanded comm<br>
services to North and South America, weather and geophysical<br>
observation, etc. Given NA being the prime market, it only follows.<br>
