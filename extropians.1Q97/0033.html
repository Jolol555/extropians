So what? It was a great architecture, killed only by desastrous marketing <br>

Actually, no. The transputer was way too bloated for my taste, the <br>
architecture a far cry from being minimalistic. What I like about the <br>
transputer is that it had on-die RAM and links (but too slow, too few, <br>
and no crossbar, so + + + ).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Effectively yes, but it is slower, and the machinery is still there -- </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True... but your processor is presumably going to have its own on-chip</i><br>

<p>
Nope, no cache. Few kByte SRAM to fit the essentials, and 128 kByte DRAM, <br>
but no cache. NO cache. No FPU. No nothing. Rank wie Windhunde.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; have separate SRAM you're still going to need extra hardware for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; address decoding. The speed should be identical to on-chip SRAM; that's</i><br>
<p>
Cache logic vs. address decoding? Another weight league entirely. Cache <br>
(in this particular supercalifragiminimalistic architecture) has bad <br>
price/performance ratio.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; why the T9000 design had this capability. The earlier chips had on-chip</i><br>
<p>
Another reason why it never quite got off ground. Admit it, it IS mythical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SRAM for performance reasons (instant access rather than six cycles to get</i><br>

<p>
On-die DRAM is a lot faster, since no signal upscaling is required.<br>

<i>&gt; Well, I went to the official launch about five years ago and it wasn't</i><br>

<p>
Alas, that the one big minus of them transputers: they botched the launch <br>
and never updated the family. Intel had it really easy back then. <br>
Speaking of that, Intel has it still easy as $\pi$.<br>
