<p>
not at all, it simply proves my thesis that people will beleive anything<br>
in order to ignore a threat.<br>
<p>
in the case of high altitude explosions, the consensus is that such<br>
explosions are a result of carbonacious chrondrite and or cometary ice<br>
fragments (they are made of quite volatile stuff). normal ferrous rocks<br>
(which would be the rock of choice for lunar rail guns) would be able to<br>
penetrate the atmosphere. A one ton ferrous rock launched from the moon<br>
will impact on Earth with the equivalent of approximately 10 kilotons of<br>
explosive energy. <br>
<p>
Additionally, being on the moon gives one a first strike advantage. you<br>
can see the other guy coming 239,000 miles away, and have plenty of time<br>
(two to three days) to get enough rocks in flight to pulverize the<br>
entire planet before your own launcher gets taken out. Additionally,<br>
remember, terran nations would need Saturn V like launching capability<br>
to do anything feasible in a lunar attack, and if the corporation<br>
developing the moon controls the best launch capability, terran nations<br>
would be in a serious conundrum. It seems that the US is bowing out of<br>
the launch business, as a government operation. Unless we start seeing<br>
serious development in the next 5-10 years by NASA or the Air Force on<br>
serious interplanetary capability, the US government will be bowing out<br>
of the Super Power business within 50 years.<br>
<p>
Lunar construction also lends itself to bomb proofing. As a lunar<br>
habitat would need to be protected from the hardest radiation, it would<br>
neccessarily be at least 6 feet under the lunar soil or rock surface.<br>
Any inhabitable space would be an automatic bomb shelter. So even if the<br>
Earth takes out your gun, you still have the rest of your infrastructure<br>
and population. The Earth population, living in a society ignorant of<br>
the concept of civil defense, would suffer great losses. In this<br>
scenario, Mutual Assured Destruction would not be a viable strategem of<br>
political gamesmanship.<br>
