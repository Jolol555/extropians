<i>&gt; My Usenet idea could do everything this could, and it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; easier to implement on a wide scale...  Just implementing that</i><br>
<i>&gt; comparably miniscule change in the "<a href="news:">news:</a>" URL would be enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; bring hypertext to every Usenet reader in the world.  Yet both ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; neglect the issue of a permanent database, and without a permanent</i><br>
<i>&gt; database, hypertext loses most of its utility.</i><br>

Let me approach this question from a different angle.  This is pretty <br>
much off the top of my head, and not a refined article.  However, <br>
this is an attempt share some of the questions that are going through <br>
my mind on this same issue, applied to audio/video.<br>
<p>
DVD has hit the streets.  At lunch today, I went to Fry's Electronics <br>
in Palo Alto, and saw a DVD player showing a motion picture on a big <br>
screen Mitsubishi television.<br>
<p>
The beauty of DVD is time-coding.  If you tell me to check out a <br>
segment of a movie (or song), you need only provide the byte range <br>
(sample range, time code range), and what *you* are referring to is <br>
what *I* will see, given that I have access to the content.<br>
<p>
The next step is to make the physical medium completely transparent, <br>
so I don't care if the content is being delivered from DVD, video <br>
server, or thumbnail sized nano-archive of *ALL* pre-recorded media.  <br>
<p>
The point is, the media content should have some kind of unique <br>
identifier, and the *medium* should be of no concern. <br>
<p>
If the content is educational, then the segments become <br>
"points-of-departure" for virtual classroom discussions, Q&amp;A threads, <br>
translations to alternative vernaculars, languages, learning <br>
modalities, etc.<br>
<p>
Because the storage and bandwidth requirements for this type of media <br>
are so much greater than for text alone, I think it's reasonable to <br>
assume that if we can develop a hypertext system that will work for <br>
these, then that same system will also work for the more "text" <br>
oriented verbal discussions.<br>
<p>
So, I suggest skipping all the R&amp;D of *text-based* systems, and <br>
jumping straight into designing systems that will work for <br>
entertainment and education.<br>
<p>
Who will PROFIT from building this type of system?  Those who own <br>
content.  The publishing companies, music companies, film studios.  <br>
Why?  Because they will be able to "repurpose" their archives.<br>
<p>
You may want your hypertext for better, faster, more accurate <br>
scientific discussion.  I may want mine for better, faster, more <br>
stimulating education and entertainment.<br>
<p>
Do Ted Turner, Gerald Levin, Michael Ovitz, etc. understand the <br>
technical requirements for these types of systems?  I would guess <br>
that they don't.  Do ADVERTISERS appreciate the benefits of these <br>
systems.  I'd guess that they do.  FINE-GRAINED PSYCHOGRAPHICS.  Such <br>
systems would enable the tracking of information preferences to the <br>
most subtle levels.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, ORIGINAL CONTENT may not hold it's value, since it <br>
will be particularly easy to imitate (paraphrase, whatever).  This <br>
may or may not be true.  However, the usage-tracking would seem to be <br>
something that will always have value, since it is so completely <br>
useful from a commercial standpoint.<br>
