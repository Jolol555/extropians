 Suppose there was a widespread preference for candidates who promise<br>
randomness, and that such promises were often enforceable. Would that<br>
give candidates an incentive to make such promises? It isn't obvious<br>
that the benefits of winning an election after making such a promise<br>
exceed the costs of getting elected.<br>
<p>
 Given the frequency with which candidates break promises ("Read my<br>
lips ...", "I won't seek a second term", etc.), why would voters<br>
expect they could enforce a promise of randomness?<br>

 The rational agents in their minds could be aware that the information<br>
value is negligible, but unable to prevent the advertisers from<br>
exploiting evolutionary quirks in other parts of the mind.<br>
