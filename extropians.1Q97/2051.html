Very true.  Its only value is as a conceptual tool that can point out to us<br>
where we are limited, and only then, if we haven't blinded our ontological<br>
perception with the use of tautologies.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In the "Free Will" post between John C. &amp; Omega,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Omega wrote 1/30/97: &lt;...at this time because I feel that no ontological</i><br>
<i>&gt; basis has yet been defined for the concept of self-referencing.  I am not</i><br>
<i>&gt; nit-picking this issue just for the fun of it, but because I believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; establishing the ontological basis for self-referencing requires us to</i><br>
<i>&gt; penetrate into an area of the ontologically unknown that we currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; perceive as acausal behind which we may find both a truer form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; acausality, and the ontological basis for self-referencing.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Leibniz's monads were a stab in this direction, a very fruitful stab</i><br>
<i>&gt; considering that little or no metaphysical work worth the name has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; done since him.  I have been pondering the nature of the link between the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypothesis that life evolves in the direction of "the edge of chaos"</i><br>
<i>&gt; (actually defined more rigorously in the biophysics work coming out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Santa Fe Institue), and the acausal (or transcendental) realm that provides</i><br>
<i>&gt; the coherency to matter-energy structural systems, the source of existence,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you will.  You have stated the matter well.</i><br>
<p>
I'll have to check out Santa Fe again.  They definitely seem to have some <br>
interesting projects going on.  With regard to the metaphysics which has<br>
been long out of favor in our culture, it seems like the curse of the human<br>
race is that every flowering of culture seems to think that its current per-<br>
ception of reality is in some way a knowledge of absolute truth thus blinding<br>
themselves to what could only be called the meta-reality behind the "curtain"<br>
we aren't supposed to look behind.<br>
<p>
Even things as intractable as this business of a priori and a posteriori<br>
logic that you mentioned above might suddenly appear in a new light when<br>
viewed from the atemporal.  I don't know if knowledge of the atemporal <br>
will lead us to an absolute truth, but I would certainly expect it to be<br>
a good step closer.<br>
<p>
This business of chaos also relates to that other can of worms that we call<br>
the "technological singularity".  While I certainly agree that we can't <br>
expect to coast through this, I have an ever growing sense that what we call<br>
the "technological singularity" is in fact a "fractal event-horizon" in a<br>
very literal sense.  When we look at the full set of symmetries we find in<br>
reality, a "fractal event-horizon" is a well definable concept that almost<br>
demands an accompanying "technological singularity".  It would be, if <br>
attained, a point of irreversibility of extropian germination.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Bravo!  It's unfortunate that your best fencing thrusts are taking place in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a completely different Fourier space than your target is inhabiting, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are hitting shadows.</i><br>
<p>
It sure seems like the discussion John and I were having (along with Lyle's<br>
Venus thread) were setting the stage for this idea.  All I know is that it<br>
dawned on me while responding to Lyle's post that Fourier spaces define a<br>
form of incompleteness of knowledge as fundamental as Godel's.  I'm some-<br>
what shocked that nobody seems to have generalized this principle before.<br>
