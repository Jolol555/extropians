<i>&gt; ...if anarchists were forced to acknowledge the necessity (one way</i><br>
<i>&gt; or another) of some government...</i><br>
<p>
I think the terms "anarchy" and "anarchocapitalism" do a disservice<br>
to the cause by emphasizing what isn't really the point.  No A-C wants<br>
the complete lack of those things we now call government; indeed, an<br>
A-C society would operate day-to-day pretty much as a young republic<br>
would.  The point is monopoly by force: we don't oppose government<br>
per se, just forcible monopoly government.  We want government to be<br>
competitive and voluntary.<br>
<p>
How about a better term: "agoriarchy"?  Rule by the free market.  This<br>
emphasizes not the absence of rules, but the moral justification for<br>
those rules--voluntary agreement.  It's interesting that your sentence<br>
above explicitly uses the word "forced"; necessity is its own argument,<br>
and needs no advocates.  If something is truly necessary, belief or<br>
disbelief won't change that.  What I find particularly puzzling is the<br>
firmly-held mystical belief that there is something magical--some inner<br>
"governmentness"--that makes a forced monopoly better at providing<br>
certain services than the marketplace.  What is a government but an<br>
organization that provides a product (defense of rights), and why<br>
should that organization not operate like any other in the marketplace?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So a fair midpoint might be to pass an amendment with</i><br>
<i>&gt; language like "one year from today, all laws enacted prior to today will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be null and void."  (The overlap is to allow continuity between</i><br>
<i>&gt; re-enactments, although testing the effects of a gap in the law could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting.)  It would also provide for the re-occurence of this sweep</i><br>
<i>&gt; on some 10, 20, or 30 year cycle.  It should also include term limits</i><br>
<i>&gt; for legislators, now easily justifiable as it makes no sense to get rid</i><br>
<i>&gt; of laws if the exact same people who passed them originally are still in</i><br>
<i>&gt; office.  A bumper sticker could be "Term limits for laws, not just</i><br>
<i>&gt; Congressmen!".</i><br>
<p>
I like the flavor of that idea as a step in the right direction.  You<br>
might even be able to pass a more limited version.  Say, "all laws<br>
expire 30 years after they are first passed, and must be explicitly<br>
renewed to continue".  That's less like a forest fire and more like<br>
thinning the old from the population.<br>
