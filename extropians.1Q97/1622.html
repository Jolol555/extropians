One of the things that lead to my vegetarianism was an article about<br>
Koko in National Geographic a long time ago.  (I believe there was an<br>
earlier TV special, perhaps a Nova, about her and about the chimp<br>
"Washo" who was taught to communicate by pressing buttons with<br>
ideograms).  Koko speaks sign language (I don't know if it's standard<br>
ASL). <br>
<p>
Koko was given a kitten as a pet.  She had the kitten for a year or<br>
so, and then one day the kitten escaped from the site, and was hit by<br>
a car.<br>
<p>
When the kitten wasn't around, Koko asked where it was.<br>
<p>
<p>
When told, Koko cried.<br>
