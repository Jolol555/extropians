Two quick points:<br>
<p>
Recently I've started using a program called Cornix.  It totes itself as<br>
Machine Assisted Reading Software.  Basically, the idea is to display<br>
each word in large print, one at a time.  This allows the reader to read<br>
much faster than she/he could normally, as it eliminates the need to<br>
move your eyes to find the next word, simultaneously training your eyes<br>
and your mind to read faster.  After only a few days I was reading 1000<br>
wpm, and I'm considering buying Vortex, the commercial version.  (Cornix<br>
is free, but Vortex is $80.  Ouch.)<br>
<p>
Anyway, with this software, I can regularly get through the whole list,<br>
without skipping any articles, in half an hour or less.  I'd reccomend<br>
it for anybody who reads a lot on their computer.  Plus, it's free.<br>
Take a look at:  <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/chigh/cornix.html">http://www.halcyon.com/chigh/cornix.html</a><br>
<p>
(I know, I sound like an ad.  I'm not affiliated, I just really like the<br>
software.)<br>
<p>
In regards to spreading the memes, I've been dreaming about possible<br>
ways for us to improve our tactics.  Political groups and television<br>
advertisers figured out long ago that by using sample test groups and<br>
trying out various advertising techniques, they could figure out exactly<br>
which message worked best, and which didn't.  This information allows<br>
democrats and corporations alike to deliver an optimally effective<br>
message to the nation.<br>
<p>
We need to do this if we want to spread powerful extropian memes to the<br>
public.  We can't just work from experience and secondhand guesses. <br>
We've got to try out our slogans, fine-tune our images, become<br>
hypersensitive to the public's technological desires and fears.  As that<br>
happens, we can use our information to spread our memes further, recruit<br>
more people, spread memes further, recruit more people...  It's a<br>
positive feedback cycle which we need to tap if we expect to be a<br>
significant memetic force.<br>
<p>
I realize that all this takes funding which is in obviously short<br>
supply...  But if we start out with volunteers, we could eventually<br>
receive a regular stream of donations to support the project.  Who'd be<br>
willing to volunteer time to help fine-tune the extropian memes?<br>
