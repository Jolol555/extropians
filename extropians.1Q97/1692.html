1. VENUS AND GENIUS:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; QueeneMUSE writes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; My answer would be, you perceive a kind of power she holds,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which is at least as influential as math, or any of the traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; male domains.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Almost true. Venus (maybe we should say Frigga, in view of J's nordic</i><br>
<i>&gt; background) has as much power as Hermes, Vulcan (her husband), etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; She yields to Jove, however, and how she stacks up against YHWH is</i><br>
<i>&gt; another matter entirely.</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; To be a mathematician, you have to form the habit of cutting through</i><br>
<i>&gt; the bullshit and getting to the point.  I use the word "cut" advisedly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's a masculine idea.  Cut.  You do it with a sword.  Even the gentlest</i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematician (most of them are much nicer than Newton) always has</i><br>
<i>&gt; that sword, and at any moment his eyes may flash and cut right through</i><br>
<i>&gt; you.  Jennifer could have learned to do that, but she couldn't do that</i><br>
<i>&gt; and still be the magical creature that she was.  Lady MacBeth is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; Venus.</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; If you think about something all the time, it changes your personality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It even changes you physically.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One thing I'm trying to do with the Jennifer story is to get away from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the idea that this is an argument about chromosomes.  It's an argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the mind, and the relation between mind and body.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If all little girls were brought up that way, then what would the cost be?</i><br>
<i>&gt; The assumption seems to be that when girls are brought up as girls,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it somehow deprives them of the "right" to be mathematicians or</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineers or truck drivers.  But if girls are taught to deny their</i><br>
<i>&gt; femininity, if they are forced to be androgynous, this deprives Jennifer</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the right to be Jennifer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you may ask yourself, why this story? why this issue....</i><br>
<p>
What you are describing here is the feminine from an archetypal perspective.<br>
I somewhat agree with the point you are trying to make with this Venus thread.<br>
In principle, female sexuality, like any viewpoint and/or manifestation in<br>
life, will be highly incompatible with various other viewpoints and/or mani-<br>
festations.  Whether it is incompatable specifically with mathematical genius,<br>
I simply don't know.  The problem is that unless other people recognize and <br>
value the archetypal viewpoint you are speaking about, you're hitting your<br>
head up against a wall in any case.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is ultimately about politics.  </i><br>
<p>
You're right about the politics, and underneath the politics, I would <br>
add religion too.  The problem with archetypes is that they can not be<br>
approached rationally, because each system of archetypes will define <br>
its own mutually incompatible logic, thus we have what we call dogma,<br>
political correctness, ideological purity, holy wars, witch hunts, <br>
and all those other warm and cozy things that litter our history.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's about what kind of world</i><br>
<i>&gt; we want to live in.  I want to live in a world with Venus in it.  I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to live in a Socialist Realist world, in which we are all machines,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Jennifers are extinct.  In the modern corporate world, there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; no place for Venus, except as a commodity.  I don't like that.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to understand how we got into this situation, and trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; imagine a viable alternative.</i><br>
<p>
This goes right back to William Blake's point about not wanting to have<br>
only one way to view reality.  Ultimately we are dealing with the:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the mind, and the relation between mind and body.</i><br>
<p>
as a far deeper and more intractable problem than than the simplistic<br>
"rationalist" and "epiphenomenalist" memes would have us believe.<br>
Fortunately the escape from the sterile future you envision is available<br>
to us, because the form of rationality we use is developed enough to <br>
highlight its own essential incompleteness even if it can not comment<br>
on the alternative forms our "rationality" may take.<br>
<p>
2. FOURIER SPACES:<br>
<p>
While Godel defined one form of incompleteness, there is another form that<br>
is equally significant, and that is the incompleteness of one coordinate<br>
space for defining in a simple form all possible localizations and cor-<br>
relations that can exist within mathematical reality.  In math these are<br>
the spaces that are defined by the myriad Fourier waveform families.<br>
<p>
For those into music, this leads into the distinctions between the relative<br>
ease or difficulty that analog and digital synthesizers have in reproducing<br>
certain forms of music.  For those in physics, this is the mathematical basis<br>
for Heisenberg uncertainty.  But in both cases, we are looking at a basic<br>
mathematical principle manifesting itself in our reality.<br>
<p>
This is also the reason why computers are such idiot savants, the are hard-<br>
wired to the Fourier space defined by their RAM's linear address space.  <br>
Software can work around this to some extent, but without special hardware,<br>
no computer is ever going to operate as efficiently in other Fourier spaces<br>
as the default one defined by its hardware.<br>
<p>
The human brain is so flexible because it contains the ability to look at<br>
things from radically different viewpoints.  The genius of Feynman was often<br>
attributed to the fact that in the middle of a difficult problem, he would<br>
stop what he was doing and suddenly shift to a different viewpoint.  Con-<br>
sidering that it is a well established fact that the human brain does Fourier<br>
transforms during its operation, the source of both Feynman's genius as well<br>
as ordinary human cognitive flexibility is obvious, we are jumping from<br>
Fourier space to Fourier space until we find a space in which the problem is<br>
suitably localized.<br>
<p>
Now in the amplitude modulated system of orthodox neuroscience, accounting <br>
for all these zillions of real time fourier transforms is a real problem, and<br>
yet the brain is well known to be loaded with data patterns that have been <br>
through Fourier transforms (leading to the periodic talk about "holographic"<br>
memory/processing).  However when we add in the intracellular microtubules <br>
which operate in the low GHz range, everything falls into place now as we now<br>
find integrated together in the wetware of the brain, the necessary structures<br>
for working in two conjugate waveform spaces; exactly what we would suspect <br>
would be needed for a cognitive device that operates within a generalized set<br>
of Fourier spaces.<br>
<p>
This spells doom for current approaches to AI.  Nanopoulos estimated that<br>
brain's information processing capacity will be larger by a factor of at<br>
least 10^11 when the contribution of the intracellular microtubules is taken<br>
into account, but I believe that this whole way of looking at this is mis-<br>
leading.  The real problem is that until AI researchers manage to integrate<br>
hardware processing ability from two conjugate waveform spaces into the same <br>
system, then no machine intelligence will ever amount to anything other more<br>
than an idiot savant.<br>
<p>
3. FOURIER SPACES &amp; CULTURE:<br>
<p>
This is next leads us into the problem of "archetypal rationality".  For <br>
small problems, holding a few dozen Fourier spaces in ones head simultan-<br>
eously, and picking an answer from some suitably localized one is no big<br>
deal, but as the problems get larger and larger, our ability to hold simul-<br>
taneous viewpoints decreases accordingly.  Now when we jump to a truly big<br>
problem like: <br>
<p>
   The nature of the feminine and role of woman in society  -OR-<br>
   The nature of time, reality, and the cosmos.<br>
<p>
Gulp, we get problems that are so complex that very few Fourier spaces will<br>
localize it well in the first place, and worse yet, it requires all of our<br>
brain power to just to deal with them one at a time.  This is why dogma,<br>
ideology, and political correctness is such an intractable problem in the<br>
human race.  Unless a person is both able and willing to switch to a dif-<br>
ferent Fourier space, they literally can not understand what the other person<br>
is talking about.<br>
<p>
In fact they not only will not be able to answer the questions that are<br>
defined in that Fourier space, there's no guarantee that they will be able<br>
to even grasp the question.  Worse yet, the definitions of the words that<br>
frame the question might seem circular (actually may well be circular) or<br>
the space might be so alien that few words even exist for it yet.<br>
<p>
Fourier spaces combined with evolutionary psychology explains concisely not <br>
only why dogma binds itself so tightly to the human mind, but how.  Thus <br>
explaining how we can get true believers who bind so tightly to, and see<br>
such obvious truths in, belief systems as far apart as:<br>
<p>
   1. Judeo-Christian vs Neo-Pagan.<br>
   2. Rationionalist/Athiest vs Mystic.<br>
   3. Socialist VS Capitalist.<br>
<p>
The mathematics of evolutionary psychology tells us that memes have to bind <br>
themselves to the human brain, or there would be no memetic evolution.  This <br>
would show up as the brain's tendency to lock onto Fourier spaces that match<br>
those produced during one's upbringing, or which have proven effective at<br>
solving various problems in life.  Along this line, brain plasticity may well<br>
function by simply reinforcing certain Fourier spaces at the expense of the<br>
general set.<br>
<p>
Fourier spaces, however, give us our viewpoints on things, so when they get <br>
bound during childhood, or at other critical moments in life, the result is<br>
that our very viewpoints become bound.  Worse yet, fear of the unknown, is<br>
tied into this, as no entity is going to survive for long in a Darwinain<br>
process if their thoughts surf overly much into unknown Fourier spaces (or<br>
take their physical bodies to places that require this), thus we would be<br>
expected to have built in discouragement to prevent overly large amounts of<br>
cognitive flexibility (although the relative amount of flexibility vs. <br>
rigidity would be expected to vary from person to person).<br>
<p>
With this more or less fixed pattern of viewpoints, plus at least some amount<br>
of built in reluctance to surf though the myriad alternative viewpoints, <br>
together with an evolutionary requirement that our viewpoints harden as we<br>
age so as to selectively propagate the memes that got one to parenthood (and<br>
later on to the status of "wise elder") we find that we have defined, in a <br>
very natural way, the very basis for ego-identity along with its normally<br>
decreasing flexibility with age.<br>
<p>
The intractability of dogma now becomes obvious:  The dogma that people <br>
espouse, IS to a large extent, their ego-identity as defined by hardened<br>
Fourier spaces within the human brain.  Not only does the pattern of spaces<br>
resist change, but unless you frame your words to fit in their spaces, they<br>
will never even hear your message in the first place no matter how many<br>
words go back and forth in the conversation.<br>
<p>
4. META-MEMETICS:<br>
<p>
In an earlier post your said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Going beyond group-think is almost impossible.  But we have to keep trying.</i><br>
<p>
But we may yet be suprised at what we can do in this area.  By consciously<br>
understanding the principles of Fourier spaces, we may be able to work some<br>
miracles here.  Earlier David Musick mentioned his technique for talking to<br>
devout Christians about extropian ideas.  To me, what he did was pay <br>
attention to, and match the Fourier spaces of the listeners.  By doing so he<br>
was able to presented patterns of words that they could understand.<br>
<p>
I feel that this is the key to what I would call meta-memetics.  If we can <br>
frame our ideas in a space that the listener is already familiar with, their<br>
brains will naturally draw the conclusions we are trying to present.  By this<br>
we gain a handle by which we can slowly lead them through a set of Fourier<br>
spaces until we can get them to other spaces wherein we can present some<br>
really extropian ideas.  Logic by itself won't do, because if it's aimed at<br>
a Fourier space they are not familiar with, not only will the words not be<br>
understood, but they won't even know how to get to the place where they can<br>
understand the words.  Each Fourier space has, quite simply, its own logic.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, considering that a person's familiar set of Fourier spaces<br>
IS their ego-identity, taking oneself, or another person into a really alien<br>
set of Fourier spaces will amount to at least a serious stretching of one's<br>
ego identity; if not a breaking and reforming.  For good or bad, we have an<br>
approach to dealing with memetics that has the potential to be both as power-<br>
ful and as dangerous as a chain-saw.  When you were commenting on the thread<br>
"Who is David, REALLY?", you said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You are probably right about the multiple personality bit.  I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; we all have multiple personalities, it comes with the territory, you are </i><br>
<i>&gt; just more aware of it than most people.  </i><br>
<p>
This is the flip side of ego-rigidity.  When someone like David, or yourself<br>
Lyle, get really good at surfing around different Fourier spaces, one's per-<br>
sonality tends to get a bit fluid (whereas in a classic case of multiple <br>
personality disorder, we would have clusters of familiar Fourier spaces<br>
without well developed connecting paths).  This scheme would also explain <br>
neatly the massive physiological changes that a multiple can go though when<br>
shifting from personality to personality, a phenomena almost impossible to<br>
explain otherwise, but easily explained by the fact that the frequency com-<br>
ponent of this generalized Fourier processor is not limited to the brain, but<br>
exists in all eukaryotic cells, thus easily spilling over into the rest of <br>
the body (and possibly beyond the body).<br>
<p>
Likewise state dependent memory and a whole host of other puzzling issues <br>
just fall right into place.  The flip side, of course, is how many zillion<br>
new questions have just been raised, and how many Fourier spaces of reasonable<br>
importance are we (as extropians) not generally familiar with?!<br>
<p>
5. UPLOADS &amp; THE FLESH:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; One of the Extropian presuppositions is that the mind is just a</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer, and that its connection with its physical substrate is</i><br>
<i>&gt; inessential.  We can reprogram ourselves, and detach ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; from our bodies, with impunity.  I don't think so.  Hubris is always</i><br>
<i>&gt; permitted, but it always has consequences.</i><br>
<p>
One thing I'm pretty sure of, is that I'm not in the market for any uploading<br>
until our techies have learned to build a generalized Fourier processor.  I<br>
have absolutely no desire to spend eternity as an idiot savant.  On the other<br>
hand, since nature has been tweeking our cellular microtubules for a billion<br>
years now, I have a feeling we won't surpass this "technology" for a while.<br>
We may yet find that building efficient AI and upload capable devices still<br>
requires the use of at least some "wetware" as this meat in our bodies is <br>
called.<br>
