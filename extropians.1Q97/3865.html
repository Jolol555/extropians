A Week of Pain<br>
<p>
I wander the city, looking, watching.<br>
So many people, so many lives.<br>
Do they all feel like I do?<br>
Do they know my pain?<br>
<p>
I look inside and feel it,<br>
the pain of my life,<br>
it burns within me,<br>
and I protect the flame.<br>
<p>
Why do I torture myself?<br>
<p>
I look again inside myself,<br>
the same familiar place,<br>
and I see my goals, my dreams, my ambitions,<br>
and there I see the pain,<br>
eating it all away.<br>
<p>
What is pain, <br>
and why does it haunt me so?<br>
Why am I so scared of it?<br>
Why can’t I just let it live;<br>
Why can’t I be a friend to pain?<br>
<p>
What is pain,<br>
Does it deserve to exist?<br>
Sometimes I just want to get rid of pain,<br>
But I am too attached to it;<br>
It is my enemy, but I love it.<br>
<p>
Can I have a peace with pain?<br>
Can I let it live without allowing it to dominate?<br>
<p>
What do I really want?<br>
I think I want peace;<br>
no more fighting, no more conflict,<br>
just a calm acceptance of how things are right now.<br>
<p>
Pain exists;<br>
Suffering exists.<br>
I acknowledge that fact,<br>
and am unsure what to do about it.<br>
<p>
What do you think?<br>
