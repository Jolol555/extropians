<i>&gt; My statement regarding "good" and "bad" memes has been somewhat</i><br>
<i>&gt; misinterpreted on this list, and possibly mistated by me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are a number of ways to look at this.  First, you can define</i><br>
<i>&gt; "goodness" in either an absolute or relative sense.  I chose absolute.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Second, you can observe a meme either from the perspective of that meme or</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the perspective of the memetic host.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now for a more detailed explanation of my theories on memetics:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The difference between a bad meme and a good meme is the difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt; a parasite and a symbiote.  In a relative sense, a bad meme may APPEAR to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a "good" meme to the sentient host (i.e. human), but a bad meme is *always*</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad in an absolute sense.  Much of the RELATIVE "goodness" in an ABSOLUTELY</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad but relatively "good" meme is superficial at best.  In fact, much of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "goodness" is also not absolute in any sense.  Example:  If you are a poor,</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorant, unhappy redneck, you are very likely go to church.  Why?  Because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it makes you feel better about being poor, ignorant, and unhappy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nonetheless, you are *still* poor, ignorant, unhappy.  An absolutely good</i><br>
<i>&gt; meme would be for the poor, ignorant, unhappy redneck to put forth the</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort to become educated and pursue higher ambitions, or whatever would</i><br>
<i>&gt; reverse his pathetic condition.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; KEY POINT HERE:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Notice some fundamental differences between good and bad memes (absolute</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense).  Good memes attack the cause, bad memes attack the symptoms.  People</i><br>
<i>&gt; are more likely to propagate RELATIVELY good memes because they can more</i><br>
<i>&gt; closely identify with symptoms than causes.  The feedback loop is *much*</i><br>
<i>&gt; tighter for relatively good memes.  An absolutely good meme is only likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; to propagate if it *also* fixes the short-term symptoms as well (i.e. is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; relatively good meme).  Therefore, the *key* to memetic propagation is</i><br>
<i>&gt; relative goodness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A meme is a non-moral agent.  It's attempts to propagate are morally</i><br>
<i>&gt; neutral.    Moral value should only be attached to the ideas encapsulated</i><br>
<i>&gt; within the meme.  Therefore, the "good"ness of a meme should only be</i><br>
<i>&gt; evaluated from the perspective of the sentient host.  Analogy:  It is like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mosquito (which is neither good or bad) which may propagate malaria</i><br>
<i>&gt; (obviously bad).  There is nothing absolutely bad about a mosquito following</i><br>
<i>&gt; its nature, and the same applies to a meme.  We don't view a mosquito as bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it is a mosquito, we only view a mosquito as bad because it contains</i><br>
<i>&gt; malaria.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
THis is understood, however, a meme's "capsule" is not separate from the<br>
content, they are homogenous. THus the subjectively moral "goodness" of<br>
a meme will have the greatest influence on its success as a meme.<br>
<p>
While a meme of the greatest level of broadly based perceived purity of<br>
subjective goodness will take a relatively longer time to propagate<br>
widely, due to its relatively greater level of purity than the existing<br>
memetic mean, due to its advanced state, it will perpetuate itself for<br>
the longest amount of time, as it will continue to be perceived as<br>
advanced, worthy of adherence, etc for a greater amount of time than<br>
morally weaker memes that are quickly outmoded and seen as primitive or<br>
barbaric.<br>
<p>
In this we can look at the Christianity meme as a model. Granted that it<br>
is seen as outmoded or corrupted at this point in time, however in its<br>
days of origin, and through most of its history, it has been seen as TOO<br>
HIGH of a moral standard for mortal men to achieve. IMHO it is due to<br>
this unreachable expectation that has ensured its longevity, and bodes<br>
ill for extropy if our goals are achieved too quickly.<br>
