<i>&gt; From: Eliezer Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [Elizer is quoting Anders Sandberg without attribution:]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; The way to test it is of course to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; bring up a child in a virtual reality with different laws... </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What a concept.  WHAT a concept.  Alert Greg Egan.  "Bring up a child in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; a virtual reality with different laws!"  Do you really think that if one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; plus one always equalled three in the virtual environment, the child</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would begin thinking in new laws of mathematics that were based on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; basic assumption?  Wouldn't he notice that in his own mind, one thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and one thought equalled two thoughts?</i><br>
<p>
How would you build a world where 1+1=3? It would be rather inconsistent, <br>
and thus unlikely to work (although the experiment could work just as <br>
well with a child in a inconsistent VR, of course). A better example <br>
would be a world with hyperbolic geometry or objects that are not persistent.<br>
<p>
BTW, David Brin has had this idea before. He wrote a short story about how<br>
the Japanese used genetic engineering and cognition enhancing techniques<br>
to make genius children in the womb. They were trained in topology,<br>
differential geometry and other branches of math, and solved problems for<br>
the government. Of course, one of the mothers realizes something nasty is<br>
going on... <br>
<p>
Another idea on this theme was a story in the Shadowrun sourcebook about<br>
Cyberspace, where the Nasty Megacorp (TM) brought up babies in cyberspace<br>
to act as super-hackers (to get from their virtual playroom to their<br>
virtual bedroom they had to "solve a puzzle", i.e. hack a security<br>
program). <br>
<p>
My guess is that this in principle is possible if you start early enough<br>
an manage to create a world still compatible with our basic brain wiring. <br>
What this wiring exactly is, well, that was the question which started<br>
this debate. :-)<br>
