On the topic of MEMETICS AND HUMOR.<br>
<p>
I have recieved this annoying memo several times ovber the past week.<br>
Seems these WILDFIRE humor things, unlike the old FAX office ones, spread<br>
infectiously, incredibly quickly; now they are even showing up on the lists -<br>
and in response to the thread earlier- can we spread positive memes thru<br>
humor, perhaps if a transhuman one was funny enough it could be read by<br>
millions, anyone here funny enough to put together a Extropian chain-humor<br>
post?<br>
The meatbody one was really funny but it was too genre specific. Too sci fi<br>
channel.<br>
<p>
Would have to sneak in Extropic memes into a mainstream or trendy topic.<br>
