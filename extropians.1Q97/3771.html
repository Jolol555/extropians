I agree with you on all counts. I was only attempting to illustrate the<br>
validity of a scientificly objective use of art. I believe I have done<br>
that. In the process we ran off on a tangent debating what objectivity<br>
is. And I agree with you that it is relative to an era. However I do not<br>
believe that fairy tales, and mythology are objective today, atleast not<br>
in modern society. In the past perhaps, but today, no. Thats not to say<br>
that fairy tales and mythology have no use to us today. I haven't really<br>
given that much thought. It only means that they are not useful in<br>
helping me understand how the universe was created and how it works. The<br>
fact that fairy tales and mythology are no longer objective does not<br>
make them subjective. It makes them ill informed. I believe you accused<br>
me of calling fairy tales and mythology subjective, but I do not recall<br>
making any such statement. Perhaps it would have been better to have<br>
said they are less objective than what is objective today so that their<br>
would be no confusion of me implying subjectivity.<br>
<p>
I define subjective statements as value judgements, and objective<br>
statements as unbiased observations. By these definitions of<br>
subjectivity and objectivity did I initially make my definitions of<br>
subjective and objective uses of art.     <br>
