"Dan Hook" &lt;guldann@ix.netcom.com&gt; quests for the holy antigrail:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Of course, to get that kind of resolution, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;being would need the entire universe as a storage device.  Since adding any</i><br>
<i>&gt;thought to this being would result in more information in the universe we</i><br>
<i>&gt;are left with the problem of infinite simulations within simulations.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt;leads to paradox and a paradox is the conclusion of a negative proof.</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, funny.  Recent stray metaphysical ponder was that maybe the universe<br>
is a big compression algorithm running on itself.  That maybe, in fact, the<br>
difference between past and future is how far the compression has progressed.<br>
Puts a funny spin on the phenomenon of memory.  &amp; it means it's freeing up<br>
space all the time.  Kinda like RAM Doubler.  Also has tie-ins to Teilhard<br>
du Chardin, Paolo Soleri and, er, sorry, is it Tippler who screwed the<br>
light bulb into Big Socket at the end of time?<br>
<p>
But more directly, is there necessarily a paradox with infinity?<br>
<p>
Btw, you're familiar with St. Anselm's "ontological proof of the<br>
existence of God"?  The synopsis I remember (a verse from "Thus Spake<br>
Saint Anselm") is sung to the tune of "Walzing Matilda":<br>
	If that than which nothing greater can be conceived<br>
	can be conceiv-ed not to exist,<br>
	Then t'is not than which nothing greater can be conceived--<br>
	This is irrefutable (?), I insist.<br>
(The supposed upshot here, logically, is that it's impossible to conceive<br>
of there not being a God.  So if you think there isn't one, you must be<br>
wrong!)<br>
	Thus spake St. Anselm,<br>
	Thus spake St. Anselm,<br>
	Thus spake St. Anselm with weighty intent.<br>
	And we're awed as we read his proof so ontological.<br>
	Would that we could understand what he meant.<br>
The "greater than can be conceived" bit combined with the paradox sounds<br>
a lot like your proof!  Find the right theologian and you might be in for<br>
some real rhetorical adventures.  Armed with a versatile proof/disproof,<br>
you could go on to discover the switch that makes reality appear and<br>
disappear.  If you do can I be the first one to try it?<br>
