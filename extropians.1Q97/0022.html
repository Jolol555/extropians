Ok, Kraftwerk may have been somewhat in the middle, allthough i still think<br>
they were leaning towards the Anti-side... (computerworld). But there are<br>
many more examples of electronic bands that were more obviously against:<br>
Nucleus computer age, Fad gadget's back to nature etc etc, todays techno or<br>
electronic music has lost the anti technology meme, and there are many<br>
examples of pro, some also expressing it in ironic forms, but with the<br>

<i>&gt;From: J de Lyser &lt;gd33463@glo.be&gt;:</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;[...] i think Max meant here that the character of that music didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;change until the mid to late 70's. (i always keep 1978 as a personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;guideline) where it was being produced electronically before, it still had</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;exerimental or less innovating, it just became 'different', less 'emotional'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(or maybe more, depending on your point of view ;-) ), and more 'technical'</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in sound.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is very different from the way I've seen it.  The early electronic</i><br>
<i>&gt;guys (up to the early '70's) were doing weird stuff, avant garde, exploring</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they thought were the frontiers of sound and musical structure.  Sure,</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the same time there were people incorporating electronics into more</i><br>
<i>&gt;traditional and popular music, but electronics still had a raw, new sound,</i><br>
<i>&gt;a sound of pure possibility.  In some ways it seemed more organic than</i><br>
<i>&gt;"natural" sound.  Same for the equipment and methods--an ad hock collection</i><br>
<i>&gt;of unreliable machines connected by a spaghetti of patch cords seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have more natural anarchy in it than a midi rig.</i><br>
<p>
If you're talking purely about the 'sound', i agree with you. That WAS new,<br>
as the instruments were new. New and revolutionary ways of generating sounds<br>
were born with those machines becoming affordable, but even the experimental<br>
music of those days had much in common with the accoustic experimental music<br>
of the same period. The way i see it, musical innovation (note: not the<br>
'sound' innovation) came in the mid to late seventies with electronic dance<br>
music and again in the mid eighties with house music (again taking some of<br>
what was left of 'traditional' music out.) Also note that the definition of<br>
an innovative music style is, if it's picked up and followed. Many people<br>
have done similar things before certain dates, but the time wasn't right<br>
then...  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Somehow it all seemed to fall apart around 1978--just when sampled keyboards</i><br>
<i>&gt;and FM synthesis came out, making the old analog methods obsolete.  Musicians</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't want to explore ur-sound or frontier sound, they wanted to push</i><br>
<i>&gt;buttons to make sounds they already knew about, whether "acoustic" (bank A)</i><br>
<i>&gt;or "electronic" (bank B--for instance my keyboard has a sound called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Kraftwerk").</i><br>
<p>
I don't know about this one, there's an underground in every music style,<br>
they come up with the new sounds, that the mainstream copies. It was like<br>
that before 1978, and after 1978, and it will probably always be like that.<br>
Note that in underground techno, analogue machines are mostly prefered (as<br>
they were cheap once, they domitated the early house and techno sound, so<br>
now everybody wants that sound), and since 5 years there is a new market for<br>
new analogue synths. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But techno seemed, to me, to adopt the "electronic" sound as a fetish,</i><br>
<i>&gt;affectation, attitude or nostalgia thing. </i><br>
<p>
If this was the case, then what is negative about that ? Techno is very<br>
nostalgic, but has innovative elements (far less melodic for one), it's just<br>
that you won't hear much of that truly innovative music in the mainstream.<br>
It usually takes between 4-6 years for elements of that innovation to be<br>
picked up by the mainstream.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And, it all seems 120 beats per</i><br>
<i>&gt;minute, 4/4, one or two chords to me, no matter how much filter "eer-</i><br>
<i>&gt;err-oor-oop" and strange sampled vocals are going on.</i><br>
<p>
you've coined it exactly, (allthough there is more to it) but this exactly,<br>
is what people are looking for in house and techno. Minimalism, the contrast<br>
between a completely 'cold' machine generated atmosphere, with just one<br>
little minimal human or 'emotional' element left, on which they focus<br>
completely. Instead of the electronic music from before the mid eighties,<br>
which was still made from a 'human controlling the machine' point of view,<br>
techno is being made more and more from a 'machine and human working<br>
together' point of view. Techno is concentrated on the 'strenght' of one<br>
particular sound or 'groove', no other sounds are added, that diminish that<br>
'strength' or effect of that one sound or groove, whereas more traditional<br>
music was all about harmony and complexity. Complexity in techno is added<br>
very by very subtly adding sounds that work together or encourage the one<br>
thing that 'works' in the particular track.    <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm being too hard of course, but my point is that the best early</i><br>
<i>&gt;electronics weren't about technology but about raw sound and its</i><br>
<i>&gt;intersection with acoustic and musical perception.  I find music with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;techno attitude to be like 50's retro: tailfins, chrome, neon, The Jetsons</i><br>
<i>&gt;and such.  It holds technology at a distance instead of being *in* it.</i><br>
<p>
please explain why.<br>
<p>
I don't agree with techno being a 'retro' movement, but if it is, then: <br>
What's so bad about looking back to a time when space exploration reached it<br>
peak ? When new technology amazed everybody ? Most people involved in techno<br>
music, are ofcourse no scientists pushing the boundries of technology. But<br>
most of them have more machines than furniture to put them on, not just<br>
musical instruments. Techno musicians are the perfect example of the 'home<br>
factory', the machines being more an extension of their 'humanity' than most<br>
other people in other professions. Instead of just using one machine, they<br>
use multiple machines to provide their income. <br>
<p>
Just to give you an example of my companies 'home factory':  <br>
I have a home studio in my living room, where the tracks are mastered, i run<br>
my record labels from my living room, using fax/phone, and email, to<br>
communicate with my pressing plants and distributors, artists, and other<br>
record labels i deal with. The graphical design is done on my PC, also in my<br>
living room. Publicity is handled by my computer and zerox copier. Records<br>
in stock are stored in my kitchen, living room and bedroom. New records from<br>
my 'competition', i get sent, as i also run a promotional magazine and<br>
website. Additional income is being made from DJ performances, for which i<br>
currently still have to leave my 'shell', but even that could change with<br>
ISDN lines.<br>
<p>
A new club 'cyber theatre' is opening here in brussels, (focussed on<br>
technology) and i'll be DJing there saturdays. One of the first things i'll<br>
be doing when i get my ISDN line, is linking with the club, and occasionally<br>
performing from my homestudio.<br>
<p>
This is just me, but i'd say that more than 1/3rd of the people involved in<br>
techno, live like this. A lot of the other people i know, doing techno<br>
profesionally or semi-professionally, are software developers, maintain<br>
servers, or are at least in some way involved in other aspects of technology<br>
other than musical.   <br>
<p>
So tell me again, how many other professions, are this involved *in*<br>
technology? ? People who just like the music, come to these clubs, are<br>
confronted with seeing technology on many levels. And usually, many want to<br>
imitate it, in order to participate/ contribute to this music or maybe even<br>
'life style', which is getting easier as the technology is getting cheaper.<br>
Techno is the music of the hackers, the young software developers, the<br>
computer graphics artists. Maybe not in the US yet, but it's growing there<br>
as well, techno in europe is mainstream, big bussiness, and hype. It's the<br>
music for the future in all aspects, if some new musical style developes and<br>
takes over, it will come from techno.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Obviously this is mostly an autobiographical piece about the plasticity</i><br>
<i>&gt;of my mind in different decades.  But still, current techno is not so much</i><br>
<i>&gt;technological as "technological" with quotes around it, a reification of</i><br>
<i>&gt;certain ideas of what technology sounds like.  In that sense earlier</i><br>
<i>&gt;electronic music was more enthusiastically, honestly, unabashedly</i><br>
<i>&gt;or unselfconsciously, technological (in the tool-making sense).  Now I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have insulted a whole genre that I know next to nothing about.</i><br>
<p>
I was just about to ask what music you based your views on techno on... <br>

Another thing about techno is the anonimity of the 'bands' or 'producers',<br>
(also supporting the idea that the human element is fading) driving the<br>
mainstream record industry to despair. Allthough no bands are really known,<br>
the style in general is having tremendous impact on the mainstream.    <br>
