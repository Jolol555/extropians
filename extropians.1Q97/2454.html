Oops, did I say Greg Bear? I meant Gregory Benford...<br>
<p>
(Some spoilers ahead): The galactic center is the focus of a huge<br>
conflict/competition between several phylums of beings, most notably the<br>
Mechs (a metacivilization of robots and AI), the Organics (mainly<br>
involving the Myriapodia (bionic insectoids) and humans (thinly spread<br>
scavengers hiding from the Mechs)) and electromagnetic beings based on the<br>
fields near the Eater, the central black hole. The reason everyone is<br>
there seems to be the immense energies that can be gathered using<br>
megaengineering from the Eater. In the surrounding interstellar clouds and<br>
star clusters there is a rich interstellar ecology, involving statite<br>
autotrops hovering above the central accretion disk, metallovores eating<br>
the autotrops, odd creatures in the interstellar clouds and living<br>
beanstalks. There is a lot of megaengineering going on, ranging from<br>
orbital cities over dyson spheres to dismantling planets using cosmic<br>
strings and space-time engineering. In the last book, it even turns out<br>
that there are even more immense forces involved (a *very* odd form of<br>
intelligence!) and there are mentions of engineering on the cosmic scale. <br>
<p>
The relevant books are _Great Sky River_, _Tides of Light_, _Furious Gulf_<br>
and _Sailing Bright Eternity_ (there are apparently two or three books<br>
before these, set 30,000 years before the galactic center saga). I <br>
recommend them, especially for the beautiful descriptions of the odd <br>
alien life and physics.<br>
