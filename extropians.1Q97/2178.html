&lt;&lt; CyberEd:<br>
I just wonder if...Blade Runner type landscape is what we can realistically<br>
expect or will new technologies change the present resource consumption<br>
patterns...&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Sorry, Ed.  Improved technology doesn't make people smarter ( unless it is<br>
implants ), it just enables them to do stupid - or smart - things with <br>
greater effect.<br>
<p>
The majority of mankind's history has been under economic systems that<br>
encourage stupid wasteful use of resources.  It has only become obvious in <br>
the past few decades because of technological leverage.<br>
<p>
The solution is really quite simple IMHO; rearrange your economic system<br>
so that economic values match ecological values.  Reward people for<br>
doing things that are ecologically desirable.<br>
<p>
  A positive example: cows are economically profitable, so some people<br>
  have a strong motivation to raise them.  We thus end up with more<br>
  cattle in this country than in India where they are deified.<br>
<p>
  A negative example: some migratory birds ( sorry, I forget the species )<br>
  are on the endangered species list.  If that bird settles on my property,<br>
  then I am prevented by law from altering my land.  Thus the bird has<br>
  become a *negative* economic value.  I then have an economic incentive<br>
  to shoot the bird, bury it, and deny that it ever was there.  People<br>
  do this, and the species becomes even more endangered.  Negative feedback<br>
  doesn't work.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; How does a posthuman view a grizzly bear? [ ...and his habitat... ] &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
As an oportunity to make a profit... *if* you set up your economy right...<br>
I'll bury you in grizzly bears.  I'll raise so many bears that bear farts<br>
will become a contributor to global warming.<br>
