(I have not read Gould's book, just basing this on what has been posted<br>
here.)<br>
<p>
It sounds like Gould is arguing that natural selection has not been as<br>
important as often thought, but that simple genetic drift and variation<br>
can account for what we see as evolution.  Over time we would expect<br>
a wider range of life forms because the random changes to the genome<br>
introduce more possibilities.<br>
<p>
At the extremes in any given parameter, we would expect a gradual widening<br>
of the curve, so the effect is that the extreme gradually increases.<br>
This would be true of every parameter: body size, brain size, brain<br>
convolution, visual acuity, jumping height, temperature tolerance,<br>
speed, etc.  If the model is a random walk, then the rate of increase<br>
should be inversely proportional to the square root of the elapsed time.<br>
However it is not clear what the right way is to measure the parameter<br>
in order to observe this.<br>
<p>
It is true that some parameters, like the mass of land animals, have<br>
not exactly followed this model.  There are no land animals as big as<br>
the largest dinosaurs.  However it is possible that this is merely a<br>
random fluctuation.  Given that we are on the extremes, the population<br>
size is relatively small.  It is not too unexpected that there should be<br>
occasional backwards steps even though the trend is towards increasing<br>
size.  The model would predict that eventually there would be dinosaur<br>
sized animals again, and even bigger ones.<br>
<p>
The problem with this model that I see is that it is hard to know how<br>
to factor in the limitations imposed by the universe.  It could be that<br>
there is an upper limit to body size beyond which life forms based on<br>
the kind of genetics used today just won't work.  So the engine of<br>
variation has to work harder and harder as it pushes up against this<br>
limit.  Variation is still occuring, and marginally larger life forms<br>
are being produced, but the rate of progress in pounds per year seems<br>
to have slowed.<br>
<p>
The same complication arises in considering how the phenomenon works<br>
in a competitive universe where natural selection is occuring.  We<br>
can still choose to focus on the random nature of the changes.  But<br>
the rate at which externally visible change happens will depend on how<br>
easy it is for changes to work in that direction.  If the change is one<br>
which causes the animal to get eaten more easily, the change engine has<br>
to work very hard to move that way.<br>
<p>
So ultimately I don't see this point of view as really providing any<br>
insight into the causes of evolution, since it just pushes the effects<br>
of natural selection off into another part of the model, where they<br>
serve to limit the rate at which changes of certain types can occur.<br>
It doesn't mean that selection isn't important; it is just a matter of<br>
what you are paying attention to.<br>
