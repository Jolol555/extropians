<p>
You could replace yourself with a jury of twelve voters instead.<br>
<p>
Anyway, you've got statistics even in this case.  You're looking at a<br>
legisture of N people composed of two random populations: N-M people<br>
picked the usual way and M people picked this new way.  I don't see why<br>
you'd expect a nonmonotonic effect, so that you'd prefer M = N to M =<br>
0, but prefer M = 0 to M = 1.<br>
