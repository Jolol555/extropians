["]&gt;Furthermore, I think that the resources of the original should<br>
["]&gt;be divided equally with the clone, as the clone was just as responsible<br>
["]&gt;for achiveing the wealth as the original.<br>
["]<br>
["]&gt;Cloning is giving birth to a life form.<br>
["]&gt;Must I give up half of what I own to a child not yet born?<br>
["]<br>
["]I would say that, in the case of complete and perfect replication (intact<br>
["]with memories), not just regular cloning, then the copy is in fact just as<br>
["]much the original as was the original at the time of the copy.  Thus, it<br>
["]would be inaccurate to say it is "a child not yet born".  If you walk into a<br>
["]duplication chamber of some type, and knowingly copy yourself, the "you" that<br>
["]comes out of the side marked "the copy", will be no less the person who<br>
["]originally walked into the duplication chamber than the person who comes out<br>
["]of the side marked "the original".  It's not like a photo copying machine,<br>
["]where there is a 15% degradation in quality.  It is 100% the original.  I<br>
["]think the question of "who's who" loses meaning in the debate.  The fact is<br>
["]you slit into two pieces (seemingly).<br>
["]<br>
<p>
I agree entirely. If however, you clone a body and not the mind, then the<br>
clone should be treated as a new person, with no accountability at the<br>
time of its creation.<br>
<p>
["]I would like to furthur one of my original comments which few people have<br>
["]picked up upon.  The question of "punishment".  The only form of punishment I<br>
["]think to be valid is to have the "criminal" make restitution to the best of<br>
["]his/her/its ability, then to work on changing the original "flaw" which<br>
["]caused the crime.  Remember, I speak only of real crimes, not socially<br>
["]imagined ones (rampant in the imaginations of many).  To simply "punish"<br>
["]someone causes no net benefit to anyone, but is rather a form of revenge.  I<br>
["]see no purpose in prisons at all.  Either do as I suggest, or impliment a<br>
["]death penalty.  I opt for the prior.  If someone is truely "beyond help", if<br>
["]there is such a thing, then either hold them in a special labor camp until we<br>
["]can neurally restructure them, or put them into cryo-stasis until that time.<br>
["] This would be the most logical and "humane" thing to do.  If anyone has<br>
["]anything to add, please do so.<br>
["]<br>
<p>
The purpose of prisons should not be to "punish" anyone. The purpose of<br>
prisons is to protect people from dangerous criminals. I do not advocate<br>
the death penalty either, however if they want to die, the option for<br>
assisted suicide should be there. Labor in prison could be used as a way<br>
to work off the debt to the victimized party, if possible. Voluntary<br>
neural restructuring would not be objectionable.<br>
<p>
["]In response to another statement:<br>
["]&gt;As for neural modifications, I would doubt that<br>
["]&gt;they would be effective, without destroying the victims personality.<br>
["]<br>
["]&gt;That's the point, to give them a new personality through brain-washing.<br>
["]&gt;It is being done.<br>
["]<br>
["]I don't think neural restructuring would destroy the original person.  I'm<br>
["]only speaking of eliminating the particular characteristic which is harmful<br>
["](pleasure in killing, raping, stealing, etc.).  It would be the best thing<br>
["]anyone could do for the person.  It involves less force than would killing<br>
["]the person.  Force is not to be used EXCEPT in self defense or preventing an<br>
["]"insane" person from doing furthur harm.  'Til next time, Shawn Johnson.<br>
