<i>&gt; &gt; If inventors produced intellectual property at the same rate as a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; comparison. Unfortunately, inventions are rare beasts, coming few and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; far between, after much research, thought, and study. The writer has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; obviously never invented a thing, or he would realize that while the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; breakthrough "Eureka" may be momentary, there is a long series of hours,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; days, and weeks spent preparing the mind to make such acheivements.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the treatise I am writing on the subject, this is what I call "The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Myth of the Lone Inventor", a cultural image that tends to mystify the</i><br>
<i>&gt; work of creation and justify our subsides of it. </i><br>
<p>
Subsidy, what subsidy? I've never gotten one red cent from the<br>
government. Where oh where wise master may I find these riches????<br>
<p>
 Existing IP monopolies<br>
<i>&gt; contribute to the myth, because they prevent all the minor tweaks and</i><br>
<i>&gt; improvements that would be the natural evolution of any design from</i><br>
<i>&gt; coming to market.  It is only when a particular tweak is recognizable</i><br>
<i>&gt; and distinct enough to make calling it an "invention" plausible that</i><br>
<i>&gt; we grant it the monopoly, thereby discouraging futher development. </i><br>
<p>
Another falsehood. By granting the creator a monopoly on use of that<br>
particular invention, a technological leapfrog effect is encouraged,<br>
where other companies and individuals, in order to compete, must invent<br>
the next greater refinement. Not having this system would stultify<br>
technological advancement as everyone would produce the same technology,<br>
and competition would be quashed, productivity would stagnate, and the<br>
economy would be swamped by overpopulation operating on restricted<br>
resources.<br>
<p>
<p>
 In<br>
<i>&gt; a free economy of ideas, 99% of inventions would be minor tweaks on</i><br>
<i>&gt; existing things, and the research itself would be cheap, and entry to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the market would be cheap, and everyone--inventors included--would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; too busy getting rich to bother filing for patents.</i><br>
<p>
If research is cheap, research labor costs would be very low, meaning<br>
researcher pay would be low. Thus you would create a disincentive to<br>
pursue careers in research, and only the incompetent morons would enter<br>
the field, much like primary education today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The occurence of a truly new and spectacular idea from nothing is a rare</i><br>
<i>&gt; and wonderful event--Newton's gravity, Darwin's evolution, and Einstein's</i><br>
<i>&gt; general relativity are the only ones I can think of,</i><br>
<p>
none are inventions. They were scientific discoveries.<br>
<p>
 but practical<br>
<i>&gt; inventions are a dime a dozen.</i><br>
<p>
They are so now only because there is an IP system in place which<br>
encourages and has encouraged their proliferation. Its interesting that<br>
you had no comment on my analysis showing that the average "dime a<br>
dozen" invention was worth 4.55 million man hours in terms of relative<br>
scarcity. if that is your opinion of the value of invention, I hesistate<br>
to ask what your opinion is of the work of the common man. (Nuff cotton<br>
deah, boss?)<br>
<p>
<p>
  Each of us has several ideas a day for an<br>
<i>&gt; improvement to an existing product.  The reason they don't get developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that entry to the market is made difficult by regulation, including</i><br>
<i>&gt; patents.  That copyrights and patents are not needed to stimulate creative</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention is evidenced by the fact that the three gentlemen above didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; need it.  Gutenberg's press was a nifty idea, building upon a foundation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of countless other inventions that came before.  He needed no patents to</i><br>
<i>&gt; become a wealthy man, and to instigate flourishing publishing businesses</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the late 1500s through the 1700s without copyrights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mr. Lorrey dismisses his opponent as "obviously not an inventor", which</i><br>
<i>&gt; conveniently ignores the fact that he is in fact a writer, and we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking about copyrights and patents.  And I /am/ an inventor.  Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't found a way around conservation of momentum yet,</i><br>
<p>
its interesting that a man who dislikes ad hominem attacks against<br>
himself takes such glee in inciting them against others. Additionally,<br>
that you still haven't paid enough attention or havent the intelligence<br>
to figure out that my drive system does not violate conservation of<br>
momentum shows that you are only interested in what you have to say and<br>
not anyone else. I suggest you check your ego at the door.<br>
<p>
 but I have<br>
<i>&gt; written software for 15 years, much of which would certainly be patentable</i><br>
<i>&gt; if I cared to (PNG's adaptive pre-filtering compression algorithm, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example) and most of which is copyrihted by my employers.  But I cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; in clear conscience name a single measurable benefit either I or my</i><br>
<i>&gt; employers gained from a copyright or patent that is not outweighed</i><br>
<i>&gt; tenfold by the crippling effects on research, gradual development, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; wasted litigation cause by IP law.</i><br>
<p>
That software cannot be patented you seem to have conveniently<br>
forgotten.<br>
