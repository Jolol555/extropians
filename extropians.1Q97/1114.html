<i>&gt; &lt;snip&gt; And suddenly, again we have a nice warm bonfire, complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; with 'politically correct' flames.  So, I'll give $5.00 to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; genius who can tell me *why*.  I'm serious.</i><br>
<p>
It's because talking/arguing/flaming over politics is such an <br>
essential survival factor for talking apes that it's deeply ingrained<br>
in us.  You can send the $5.00 to your favorite extropian charity.<br>
<p>
Someone else mentioned this recently in regard to the fact that<br>
memes that arouse political passions seem to be much more effective<br>
in propagating themselves.  Going out on a limb a bit, this is why<br>
I believe that politically passionate subjects are the most likely<br>
to be divorced from "objective knowledge" whatever that is.<br>

<i>&gt; The gender specialization _will_ become obsolete after we shed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; protein/DNA matrix, but this is still many decades/centuries off.</i><br>
<p>
Decades/centuries?  Peter Russel in his fairly recent book<br>
'The Global Brain Awakens' makes a fairly strong case that we<br>
humans repeatedly underestimate the rate of change when <br>
exponential growth curves are involved.  I tend to agree with<br>
him.  Decades I would agree with (if the number of them were low)<br>
but, IMO, not centuries.<br>
<p>
There is also the possibility that technological development may<br>
end up being hyper-exponential (with time) when "qualitative" and<br>
"non-continuous" breakthroughs (e.g. as in that often mentioned<br>
"hardware vaporware" that will suddenly boost computer/communication<br>
speeds by factors of thousands that I keep hearing is right around<br>
the corner) not to mention unexpected cross-fertilizations between<br>
different disciplines.<br>
<p>
Maybe it won't in fact be hyper-exponential, but I feel that your<br>
conclusion still falls under what I would call the default way<br>
of estimating the future that Russel describes as flawed.  What<br>
do you think, do I have the beginnings of a compelling case?<br>
<p>
Regarding your second to last paragraph:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I do not care whether this stuff is genetically determined, or a product </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the environment. All I see is the result that there are fewer women in </i><br>
<i>&gt; hard sciences (lots of them in molbio, though). Instead of an </i><br>
<i>&gt; equilibration, the trend goes in an opposite direction (at least in </i><br>
<i>&gt; Krautland). Ignoring this for whatever reasons, PCish or otherwise is </i><br>
<i>&gt; not prudent, nor is it constructive. Developing a selective blindness for </i><br>
<i>&gt; a problem does not make it go away.</i><br>
<p>
I couldn't agree more.  Selective blindness is IMO perhaps one the <br>
better hidden and more dangerous hazards facing the human race, and<br>
unfortunately is something that I believe is genetically hardwired<br>
as a response to subjects that arouse political passions.<br>
<p>
I know it's a broad sweeping statement, but can we contemplate the<br>
history of the human race for even a moment without coming to this<br>
conclusion.  I personally don't believe that the linkage between<br>
"selective blindness" and "political passion" will be severed with<br>
anything less than "strong medication" on a fairly universal basis;<br>
it may not require nano, but what it will require should be a basis<br>
for some very penetrating discussion.  <br>
<p>
I'm not convinved that rationality can overcome this "selective<br>
blindness" with regard to politically charged issues.  Blind <br>
evolution that selects for ever stronger rationality, yes that<br>
should do it, but that's an awfully bloody process which is the<br>
reason why blindess with regard to political issues has evolved<br>
in the first place (remember, politics is by definition at <br>
gunpoint).<br>
<p>
Howard Bloom talks about this general subject in his book<br>
'The Lucifer Principle' a book which interprets human history<br>
in terms of genetic and memetic evolutionary principles and<br>
goes a bit into the inter-relation between the two principles.<br>
<p>
All the above said, I don't consider this an automatic cause<br>
for pessimism, but going into this is a real can of worms, so<br>
I will wait to see if people even agree that genetically <br>
selected political blindness is a problem in the first place.<br>
