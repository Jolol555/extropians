On Tuesday, March 04, 1997 5:23 PM, Robert Schrader wrote, in response <br>
to quibbles with his earlier statement that "Creativity is an <br>
artifact, not a neccesity":<br>
&lt;... an artifact is something that appears from a system, but is not <br>
essential to its functioning.&gt;<br>
<p>
and added:<br>
&lt;The whole point of this post was to try and get a grip on the <br>
mechanism of creativity, not to offend artists.&gt;<br>
<p>
You were trying to describe human minds via neural net models, which <br>
is a very useful approach.  But, that doesn't mean you can assume that <br>
because creativity appears to be an artifact in neural nets that it <br>
might be an artifact in human minds.  Human minds are not *merely* <br>
neural nets, even though neural nets may be an appropriate model for <br>
portions of the human mind.<br>

On Thursday, March 06, 1997 4:09 AM, Tony Csoka noted:<br>
&lt;I don't think emotions are an artifact. Rather, I think they are an <br>
evolving aspect of (trans)human intelligence.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes. What I am trying to say is that properties that may have been <br>
artifacts during a system's early evolution may no longer be merely <br>
artifacts and may, in fact, as DoBono noted (in Natasha's original <br>
post), become necessities for the advanced system in its present <br>
environment.<br>
<p>
In other words, while there *are* mechanisms to human creativity, and <br>
it is useful to get a grip on them, it is not valid to reduce human <br>
creativity to these mechanisms.<br>
