Primitive == subsistence farmers or primitive == hunter-gatherers?<br>
Jared Diamond feels the latter are likely to be more intelligent by<br>
culture if not by marginal evolution than humans living in more<br>
artificial, hence nicer, environments.  Specifically that many of them<br>
are more generally exploratory and playful than modern humans, though<br>
outhinking a couch potato or McTourist is not difficult.<br>

I'd suggest H-G problems stem more from massive technological<br>
inferiority and more deadly, massive immunological inferiority leading<br>
to societal wipeout, with which few people will deal well.  Amerinds<br>
adapted to horses, guns, and applicable Eurasian agriculture quite<br>
well.  Cherokee successfully adapted to US legal system, which was<br>
ignored by Andrew "fuck the Court" Jackson.  Hard to adapt to being<br>
outnumbered and outgunned by people willing to destroy, not conquer,<br>
you.<br>

(Might Superpowers could conquer neither Vietnam or Afghanistan, despite<br>
clear ability to redundantly destroy biosphere.  Suspect US success in<br>
Iraq related more to tendency of Iraqis to run away.)<br>
