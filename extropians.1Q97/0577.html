<p>
Most Chromosomal DNA does not code for Proteins or RNA<br>
<p>
The genomes of higher organisms seem to contain a large excess of DNA.<br>
Long before it was possible to examine the nucleotide sequences of<br>
chromosomal DNA in the haploid genome of an organism, it was evident that<br>
the amount of DNA in the haploid genome of an organism has no systematic<br>
relationship to the complexity of the organism. Human cells, for example,<br>
contain about 700 times more DNA than the bacterium E. coli, but some<br>
amphibian and plant cells contain 30 times more DNA than human cells<br>
(Figure 8-6). Moreover, the genomes of different species of amphibians<br>
can vary 100-fold in their DNA content. [...]<br>
<p>
The most important implication of this estimate is that although the<br>
mammalian genome contains enough DNA, in principle, to code for nearly 3<br>
million average-sized proteins (3x10^9 nucleotides), the limited fidelity<br>
with which DNA sequences can be maintained means that no mammal (or any<br>
other organism) is likely to be constructed from more than perhaps 60000<br>
essential proteins.<br>
