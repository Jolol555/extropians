<i>&gt;[...]I remember the last time I saw a Rainbow.....It was a triple...awesome.</i><br>
<i>&gt;And though I understand why they occur, I really didn't want to think about</i><br>
<i>&gt;that when I saw them, I just wanted to enjoy them.</i><br>
<p>
I've found a techie-sounding way to talk about this.<br>
<p>
A "magical" perception and an explanation are two ways of<br>
looking at something that are mutually exclusive like the two views<br>
of a Necker cube.  If you can see both at the same time, then it's not<br>
this particular kind of "magic."  There are other sorts of wonder,<br>
beauty, interest that are compatible with normal modes--in fact I<br>
think magical experiences often settle into these tamer (yet valuable)<br>
forms.  But if you don't know this fragile wild kind of magic I think<br>
you...er...have something to look forward to.<br>
