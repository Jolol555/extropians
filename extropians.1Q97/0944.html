<i>&gt; The Extropy Institute has a philosophy which strives towards spontaneous</i><br>

<i>&gt; healthy criticism.  It's a far more open system than any religion or</i><br>
<i>&gt; fundamentalist philosophy.  I like that.  However, it's been painfully</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious to me, throughout my life, how far people can get when they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; dogmatically committed towards a particular idea.  Ideas like bigotry,</i><br>
<i>&gt; fascism and censorship are incredibly rampant because they develop a</i><br>
<i>&gt; devoted and unquestioning following.  The masses flock to their</i><br>
<i>&gt; shepherd.  They're insanely bad memes, but problematically trong:</i><br>
<i>&gt; if people are more powerful when they are fundamentally committed</i><br>
<i>&gt; and when surrounded by people who agree with them, then they'll adapt</i><br>
<i>&gt; as is most advantageous to them:  conform, centralize, dogmatize.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I don't like any of this.  But this has been a problem that I've been</i><br>
<i>&gt; fighting with for most of my life.  I'm not here to argue that religion</i><br>
<i>&gt; is better than healthy criticism and spontaneous order.  I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that.  But in the face of what's out there, how can I, and others like</i><br>
<i>&gt; me, fight a meme of centralization which may be fundamentally more</i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful than the one I'm trying to spread, simply by virtue of the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the meme I'm spreading can never be a dogma?  Can this meme ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; surpass authoritarianism?</i><br>

"The times, they are a' changing"  I suggest you drop in on on the news<br>
group alt.religion.scientology or the IRC chat #scientology.  The internet<br>
may well be the end of this particular nasty parasitic meme.  And if there<br>
*ever* has been an example of spontaneous order, you will find it in the<br>
net.  Keith Henson<br>

PS, if you want to join the frey, there is plenty of glory to be had.  I<br>
found this battle to be more interesting than playing Doom.<br>
