<p>
What's wrong with creamy desserts?  What am I supposed to do, <br>
eat turnips?   or some kind of virtual silicon dessert?  <br>
<p>
The rest of the story is that Jen was a believer.  She believed in <br>
macrobiotics, among other things.  I didn't.  I was, as always, a <br>
creedal minimalist.  An odd thought:  in the hippie communes of the <br>
southwest, early 70s, macrobiotics was the equivalent of extropianism.  <br>
The word "macrobiotics" means the science of longevity, which <br>
they conceived of as being primarily a matter of diet.  I didn't <br>
believe in that any more than I belive in AI --&gt; Strong Nanotech --&gt; <br>
resurrection of frozen bodies.  <br>
<p>
Maybe it's time to bring creedal minimalism to an end.  <br>
