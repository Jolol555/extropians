     I've lurked on this list for some time, and unfortunately havent even <br>
     been able to read the digests for about 2 months. (Being responsible <br>
     for install of 5800 copies of netscape in 74 different branches about <br>
     country by a slew of people who dont want to help you can sap your <br>
     free time just a bit. :)<br>
     <br>
     I read with great interest the story on ccn.com yesterday about the <br>
     scientists that have cloned a sheep.<br>
     <br>
     Have we had a philosophical/ethical debate on Human cloning? (If we <br>
     have, I apologize, I've missed it)<br>
     <br>
     The first thing that came to mind was "The Cat Who Walks Through <br>
     Walls" where your clones are held in stasis to provide 'spare-parts'. <br>
     Imagine cloning a baby at birth. Imagine cloning from a cell in one of <br>
     those heads frozen at alcor.<br>
     <br>
     But what 'rights' do the clones have? Are they just more humans with <br>
     individual rights? Does the prime being have dominion over the clones, <br>
     and that perhaps a clone could have it's brain function <br>
     limited/clipped during it's gestation in order to keep the organism <br>
     purely a cell factory?<br>
     <br>
     An interesting debate surely.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     An interesting aside, although I rarely read comics anymore, I've been <br>
     unable to totally sever my ties to the IRON MAN comic book. In a <br>
     recent issue Tony Stark, Iron Man Himself, is trapped without his <br>
     armor by an armored super assassin. He tells the guy "If you dont <br>
     leave, I'm going to kill you. Look deep into my eyes and you'll know <br>
     it's true." And when the assassin looks at him a bright flash blinds <br>
     and dazes him. As Stark runs away he thinks to himself, "It's called a <br>
     magnesium flare, nanoteched onto contact lenses, I originally <br>
     developed them for riot control police."<br>
     <br>
     It's interesting to see where Extropic Ideas like nanotech end up in <br>
     mainstream media. Although I must admit, Iron Man tends to be rather <br>
     Extropic. He wears the armor chest plate to keep his heart beating <br>
     after it is damaged by shrapnel, he makes a list of books his <br>
     employees to read and it includes Toffler and Dawkins.<br>
