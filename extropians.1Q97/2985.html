          By ASHLEY DUNN <br>
<p>
          The Cyborg as Warp-Speed Evolution<br>
<p>
              Thirty-six years ago, Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline,<br>
two medical researchers at<br>
               Rockland State Hospital in Orangeburg, N.Y., published a<br>
paper in the journal Astronautics<br>
          that proposed a fascinating and strange solution to some<br>
difficult problems of long space flights. <br>
<p>
          Clynes and Kline believed that trying to maintain a perfect<br>
Earth<br>
          environment in a space ship was both difficult and dangerous<br>
          because of the fragility of a capsule and the enormous demands<br>
          of the body for oxygen, food and water. <br>
<p>
          Millions of years of evolution created human bodies that are<br>
          well adapted to Earth. But space posed a whole new<br>
          environment to which humans were poorly suited. In space,<br>
          people were fish out of water. <br>
<p>
          As a solution, they suggested slightly changing the human body<br>
          so that it would be better suited to the rigors of space. They<br>
          believed it was time to tinker with evolution. <br>
<p>
          "Space travel challenges mankind not only technologically but<br>
          also spiritually, in that it invites man to take an active part<br>
in his<br>
          own biological evolution," the two researchers wrote. <br>
<p>
          Clynes, the chief research scientist at Rockland, and Kline, the<br>
          director of research at the hospital, wrote in their 1960 paper<br>
          that devices embedded in the body could automatically alter<br>
          certain body functions and regulate them in the same way that<br>
          the body does now. Through the use of drugs and other means,<br>
          these devices could lower body temperature, heighten radiation<br>
          resistance and even prevent future astronauts from feeling<br>
          bored, depressed or sexually deprived on long flights. <br>
<p>
          With these devices there was the possibility of human beings<br>
          living in space qua natura -- a native of the cosmos. To<br>
describe this new being, they coined the<br>
          term "cyborg," that is, a cybernetic organism. Included with<br>
their paper was a picture of a white<br>
          mouse with an osmotic pump over its tail -- the first cyborg. <br>
<p>
          Ever since the publication of "Cyborgs and Space" in 1960, the<br>
concept of the human-machine<br>
          being has entranced scientists and laymen alike. NASA even<br>
published several reports on possible<br>
          cyborg research, although it quickly abandoned the term in favor<br>
of the more scientific sounding<br>
          terms like "teleoperator" or "human augmentation." <br>
<p>
          Some people argue that a simple type of cyborg now makes up<br>
about 10 percent of the<br>
          population, a figure arrived at by adding up everybody with a<br>
pacemaker, prosthetic device or<br>
          other electrical or mechanical body component. Some have even<br>
stretched the definition to include<br>
          all those who work at computer terminals or some other form of<br>
close linkage between humans<br>
          and machines. <br>
<p>
          But the advanced cyborg envisioned by Clynes, Kline and others<br>
-- one that enhances human<br>
          abilities and totally merges with the body -- has largely<br>
remained a denizen of science fiction,<br>
          known to the public through characters like The Terminator or<br>
RoboCop. <br>
<p>
          In the past decade, however, the cyborg has begun to emerge from<br>
the world of fiction and<br>
          assume a position of significance in the minds of sociologists,<br>
historians and others as a symbol of<br>
          the dissolving boundaries between humans and machines. <br>
<p>
          For millennia, human beings have protected the sanctity and<br>
unity of the body. It was the filter<br>
          through which our world was perceived and understood. It was the<br>
element that defined our role<br>
          and place in society. It defined our evolved position as the<br>
masters of this planet. <br>
<p>
                             But the technological cataclysms of the past<br>
century have gradually jarred<br>
                             that view. We are no longer masters but<br>
rather ants once again. Space<br>
                             exploration has certainly placed human<br>
existence in a new context. You<br>
                             can feel the sense of smallness now. We no<br>
longer perceive ourselves as<br>
                             the center of the cosmos but as mere dust in<br>
a vast universe. <br>
<p>
          Even here on Earth, the development of powerful technologies<br>
like nuclear weapons and the<br>
          computer have pointed out the inadequacies of homo sapiens. We<br>
still excel in many areas, yet<br>
          cannot compete against some of our own creations. The pace of<br>
our body's evolution is too slow<br>
          to adapt to the environment we have created. <br>
<p>
          In the past, humans have used tools and machinery (self-powered<br>
tools) to overcome certain<br>
          physical and mental weaknesses. But virtually all of them<br>
required conscious action to manipulate. <br>
<p>
          Kline and Clynes believed that the solution lay in forging an<br>
intimate connection between machines<br>
          and the human mind below the conscious level. They proposed<br>
automatic devices that required<br>
          little monitoring by their human hosts. For example, an embedded<br>
osmotic pump could be used to<br>
          sense high radiation levels and then provide drugs that could<br>
increase resistance. They also<br>
          suggested using automatically administered drugs to lower body<br>
temperature and thus to reduce<br>
          the need for food and fluid. <br>
<p>
          One of my favorite examples is the use of an implanted drug pump<br>
to combat psychotic episodes.<br>
          The pump could be triggered remotely from earth or by the poor<br>
fellow's crew mate in case of<br>
          trouble. <br>
<p>
          In many ways, the key concept behind Clynes and Kline's cyborg<br>
was the linking to subconscious<br>
          functions. Only then did humans and machines operate as one --<br>
just as the words cybernetic and<br>
          organism had been collapsed into a single term. Clynes was far<br>
more expansive in his definition of<br>
          a cyborg, saying that even a person riding a bicycle could be<br>
considered one because of the close<br>
          link in operation between machine and rider. <br>
<p>
          In the years to follow, Clynes continued to develop the concept<br>
of the cyborg, coming up with a<br>
          Cyborg II, III, IV and V. <br>
<p>
          Cyborg II involved the manipulation of human emotions through a<br>
series of mental exercises. III<br>
          involved genetic alterations to enhance the human emotional<br>
range, while IV involved deeper<br>
          genetic changes and V brought the separation of mind from body. <br>
<p>
          What is fascinating about Clynes and his cyborgs is that he<br>
believed that even with these extreme<br>
          modifications to homo sapiens, there would be no change to the<br>
fundamental essence of humans. <br>
<p>
          Clynes said in an interview published in 1995 in the "The Cyborg<br>
Handbook" that these emotional<br>
          and physical changes had in no way altered the ability of these<br>
beings to experience emotions --<br>
          "no more than riding a bicycle does, and even more importantly,<br>
it hasn't altered their essential<br>
          identity." <br>
<p>
          It seems strange to think that even minor modifications to the<br>
body and mind -- the filters through<br>
          which we perceive reality -- would not result in fundamental<br>
changes. What if the blind could see<br>
          or the weak become strong? <br>
<p>
          Perhaps there is some protected essence that can never be<br>
changed. But what relevance does that<br>
          have when something as radical as gender, mental capacity,<br>
strength, emotional range and other<br>
          aspects of life have been altered? Marshall McLuhan, who<br>
insisted that electronic media were<br>
          extensions of human senses, made a career out of dissecting how<br>
just television and mass media<br>
          brought about fundamental changes in how we perceive reality. <br>
<p>
          In the past few decades, the science of cyborgs has moved<br>
slowly, but the imagery of the modern<br>
          Frankenstein has captured the interest of sociologists,<br>
historians and philosophers. For them, the<br>
          image of a changeable, hybrid body and mind has come to stand<br>
for a transformation of all the<br>
          structures of the past, including race and gender dynamics, that<br>
have grown out of the particular<br>
          form of our bodies. <br>
<p>
          The cyborg is beginning to destroy the hard boundaries not only<br>
between humans and machines<br>
          but also between humans themselves. It is, as the science<br>
historian Danna J. Haraway wrote, a<br>
          reinvention of nature. <br>
