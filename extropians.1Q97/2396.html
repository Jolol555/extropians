The beautiful snow cascading over the city has put me in a football <br>
kinda mood, so listen up:<br>
<p>
There are no cheerleaders here!  (although anyone who wants to wear a <br>
short skirt may do so...)  If you are reading this list, you have a <br>
position on the team.  We need people to scrimmage with opponents to <br>
expansion.  We need people to draw charts and diagrams that the rest of <br>
us can use.  We need people to write the game books.  We need coaches to <br>
provide vision and guidance, to boost morale, to train the speciality <br>
teams.   We need the people who invented the game to show us how far we <br>
have progressed.  We need people to produce the equipment, design the <br>
uniforms, and sell the advertising space in the big stadiums.  <br>
<p>
In short, we need everyone's abilities.  Who cares whether you are a <br>
genius or not, whether you have ever tackled writing a book or <br>
designing a program--there are plenty of us out there to back you up. <br>
Not everyone gets to run into the end zone, but someone has to pass the <br>
ball to the one who can!  <br>
