It depends on what diseases we are talking about. Genetic diseases are<br>
obviously a problem, but if it is just a case for genetic predisposition<br>
towards some diseases then a replacement part might be helpful. And<br>
diseases that are due to external factors such as bacteria, viruses and<br>
the environment (like excessive drinking) could be treated by fresh<br>
organs. Of course, they are more likely to develop these diseases and<br>
there are some immunological complications if antibodies have been<br>
developed against the sick organ, but I think they might be a viable way<br>
to extend life a bit more. <br>

I have only been in surgery once, and it was a relatively minor hernia<br>
operation. Still, the fact that it hurt afterwards and it took me several<br>
weeks to get back to my old activity level made me realize that we<br>
sometimes speak a bit too casually about transplanting orgams, inserting<br>
bionics and changing our bodies - even with good medical technology (and<br>
care) it will be painful, expensive and take time. Sorry, no "heart<br>
transplants while you wait" shops. <br>
