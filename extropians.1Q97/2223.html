<i>&gt;I just finished reading about the doomslayer Julian Simon in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;February 1997 edition of Wired magazine.  The article is chock full of</i><br>
<i>&gt;non sequiturs.  </i><br>
<p>
Your claims are that things must be getting worse overall because they are<br>
getting worse in one particular place.  That's the non sequitur, not Simon's<br>
claims.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One labeled</i><br>
<i>&gt;a Perception:  Air Pollution is getting worse is not only a perception</i><br>
<i>&gt;but a reality in areas such as Phoenix Arizona.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes, it's getting worse in some areas.  But it's getting better in others (LA<br>
air has improved tremendously in the 10 years I've been here.  Smog is now<br>
exceptional where I live in Orange County).  Overall, it's getting better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sprawl is paving over</i><br>
<i>&gt;cropland as I have witnessed in the surrounding area of Philadelphia and</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially in Bucks County , were New Yorkers are settling.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but new cropland is being irrigated/terraced to replace it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Third World food problems are a reality, take a trip to India.  </i><br>
<p>
Very much so, but less of a reality than at any time in the past.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Forests are vanishing and being replaced by monoculture tree farms.  </i><br>
<p>
In the first world, both wild forest and tree farms are increasing.<br>
 Deforestation is still a problem in the third world (but see below)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Fish are being</i><br>
<i>&gt;fished out, I just think of what happened in Perce, Gaspe Peninsula were</i><br>
<i>&gt;a few years back it was a thriving fishing village.  </i><br>
<p>
Deep sea fishing has become a classic 'tragedy of the commons" situation.<br>
 Our fish will come from farms in the near future, just as our vegetables do.<br>
 There will be plenty of fish.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How does Julian</i><br>
<i>&gt;Simon suddenly qualify as an expert on species extinctions?  What are</i><br>
<i>&gt;his credentials for asserting that only one species is going extinct</i><br>
<i>&gt;each year?      </i><br>
<p>
He's not the one saying it.  It's just that nobody can find many species<br>
going extinct.<br>
<p>
One thing you have to remember.  Simon does not claim that the non-human<br>
biosphere will do well.  His claim is that our increasing population will<br>
leave us a world where virtually all humans are well-fed, well-housed,<br>
comfortable, entertained, and long-lived.  Humans will be able to preserve<br>
natural habitat if they want to, but whether we have mountain lion habitat,<br>
ski resorts, or some of both will be our choice.<br>
