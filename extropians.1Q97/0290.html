In a message dated 97-01-06 14:04:05 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 So what sort of motivations did you have in mind for uploading? I'm<br>
 honestly curious.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I was actually asking, what just out of curiosity,honestly wanting to see how<br>
this question would be answered, and in fact I have gotten so many<br>
interesting responses that I am really glad I posted that query.<br>
<p>
I am not locked into one mind set about uploading. i am not sure it had merit<br>
to me, unless as a backup. I see longevity as the first motivation. After<br>
that, self improvement. Then in different orders, scarcity (environmental and<br>
poplation type concerns), curiosity ( of the type you mention, being able to<br>
explore say space, or physics unknown as yet etc), augmentation and<br>
redesigning ( more freedom of form), a general dislike of things physical (<br>
in some peoples case), and more...<br>
Mostly it is to avoid entropy and obsolescence.<br>
<p>
Still, motivation is different from profit, which is again a different<br>
concept than "value"... Making  "profit'  an interesting concept for an<br>
upload, and am still pondering the question, and have enjoyed your response,<br>
thanks.<br>
