<i>&gt; English is the greatest language the planet has ever seen because it's not</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficent! English constantly evolves a such a rapid pace that if you time</i><br>
<i>&gt; traveled 100 years from now, you wouldn't understand a word of it and</i><br>
<i>&gt; though it is one of the hardest languages to learn, it allows for the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; flexibility and creativity. Fuck the rules! I say... Forget Ebonics. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hail English!</i><br>
<p>
(1) The sample set of human languages is so small, and the evaluation<br>
period so short, that I don't think one can draw any conclusions from<br>
its present dominance.  It just happened to be the language that was<br>
used my the world's major imperial power, and later by the world's<br>
leader in technology.  To evaluate language as a technology itself, I<br>
think it makes more sense to look at earlier cultures where it had more<br>
obvious influence.  Chinese comes out the winner there, and for some<br>
good reasons, especially the writing system.  It is far more efficient<br>
than alphabetic systems: more words per page, fewer penstrokes per word,<br>
faster to read and comprehend.<br>
<p>
(2) Evolution of the language has been rapid, but is clearly slowing.<br>
Today's students may have difficulty with Shakespeare and downright<br>
consternation with Chaucer, but in 2030--even 2130--a 1930 recording of<br>
a Rudee Valee tune will sound as ordinary as it does today.  Spelling<br>
and vocabulary stabilized shortly after the printing press; phonology<br>
is stabilizing now, after the advent of sound recording, radio, and<br>
television.  Sure, there will always be some growth, but not as rapid.<br>
<p>
(3) The vast, detailed, expressive vocabulary of English is indeed a<br>
good thing, and works well for expressing fine distinctions that would<br>
be difficult in other languages (only French and German come close),<br>
but it also encourages ambiguity: words created or borrowed to express<br>
some narrow, specific idea are often diluted into more general meanings.<br>
"Replica", for example, once meant "a reproduction of an artifact by<br>
the original artisan".  Now it swims in the same soup as "copy" and<br>
"duplicate"--it has even migrated into the territory of "model".<br>
<p>
English has served us adequately, but we can do much better.  In<br>
particular, we can try to fix the well-known identifiable problems<br>
like sexism, unintentional ambiguity, poor adaptability to new<br>
concepts, cultural dependencies, and others.  Whatever we create<br>
will no doubt evolve other problems--but we'll never find our way<br>
<p>
