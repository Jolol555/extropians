Yes. Not only should we explain why people now disagree with us, but<br>
also why people in the past have disagreed.  We especially need to<br>
explain the events that they used as an empirical basis for their<br>
claims.  Hence my post on the feudal to state transition.<br>

<p>
Hard to tell.<br>

<i>&gt;} This highlights another core issue: to what degree does social pressure</i><br>
<i>&gt;} function to stabilize our social order?  Economists like me, who tend</i><br>
<i>&gt;} to ignore social pressure in our models, tend to think that the effect</i><br>
<i>&gt;} is minor.  But others see social pressure which keeps people acting</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This still bothers me.  Religion is bloody real; how do economists</i><br>
<i>&gt;account for it?  That it's a veneer under which people pursue their</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational goals anyway?  I'm willing to grant that this may true to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;larger extent than I'd easily imagine on my own.  Still, when I read in</i><br>
<i>&gt;_Hidden Order_ the note that economics assumes rational behavior coupled</i><br>
<i>&gt;with relatively simple goals, I wondered whether some 'social' goal like</i><br>
<i>&gt;"seeking status" or "being 'with' other humans" or something shouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;be factored into more speculative models.</i><br>
<p>
There are lots of interesting models of participation in religion and<br>
status seeking.  But we tend to not add these effects when we are<br>
modeling other phenomena.  We tend to think that these systems are<br>
robust enough that we do not need to model everything in great detail<br>
to see the dominant processes.  But if could be that social systems<br>
are not as modular as this, and we really have to understand<br>
everything at once to understand anything.  If so, it may be pretty<br>
hopeless. <br>
