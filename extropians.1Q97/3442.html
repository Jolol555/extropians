} It's certainly not rude to do so, but it's not necessarily a good thing.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, some people have high enough volume, and few enough<br>
worthwhile ideas, that I have found it worth filtering them out.  Deleting<br>
lots and lots of messages takes some time, and more annoyance.  Actually<br>
I have four levels of filtering, manifested as four mailboxes:<br>
<p>
/dev/null, for the few, the proud, the worthless.<br>
<p>
junk, for those whom I normally don't read, but who occasionally say<br>
something interesting.  I figure if they do, someone will followup to<br>
them and I'll be notified by the included text, and I might be able to<br>
go back and read the original.  If there's any need.<br>
<p>
extro, for the bulk of the list.<br>
<p>
select, a recent addition.  The idea was that I might prefer to read<br>
only a few guaranteed people when I was really busy, and ignore the bulk<br>
list unless they flagged something interesting.  I've actually generally<br>
been able to follow the main list as well.  <br>
<p>
But, at Robin's suggestion I'll make that filter available to anyone who<br>
asks.  Send mail to <br>
<p>
select@ugcs.caltech.edu <br>
<p>
and about once a day I'll send you my select mailbox, probably with the<br>
advantage of having been thread-sorted.  Usefully replying to it won't be<br>
possible; you'll have to go through the main extropians list to respond<br>
in public.<br>
<p>
Current selectees, in no order:<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg<br>
Carl Feynman<br>
Damien Broderick<br>
Damien Sullivan (me)<br>
Greg Burch<br>
Tom Morrow<br>
Max More<br>
Robin Hanson<br>
John Clark<br>
Hara Ra<br>
Hal Finney<br>
Eric Watt Forste<br>
Eugene Leitl<br>
Alexander Chislenko<br>
Jay Reynolds Freeman<br>
<p>
I can think of other people who might be on the list, but they're either<br>
gone or they've been very quiet.<br>
<p>
ObDisclaimer: non-selectees are not considered worthless by any means.<br>
They just haven't written what I've found to be consistently provocative<br>
or amusing enough posts.  I don't know if I meet my own standards, but<br>
I've gotten some praise at least, and it's my filter.<br>
<p>
Merry part,<br>
