But knowing the basic Answers doesn't mean knowing everything; we know the<br>
rules of Game of Life and might even consider them simple, almost banal,<br>
but I think most of us are surprised and delighted by the ever more<br>
complex patterns that are invented or discovered (like prime-generating<br>
patterns or bizarre flotillas). Reality seems to be chaotic/self-organizing <br>
in some deep sense, we cannot predict the higher levels from the lower <br>
levels. The traditional view of the TOE and Answers seems to have been <br>
quite linear: if you know them, you know everything that is to be known. <br>
I don't think so. <br>
<p>
And then there is the possibility of creation. I think this is the most<br>
interesting field, and it will certainly help me avoid boredom: the<br>
creation of new systems, new worlds. OK, we know the Meaning of Life, but<br>
what if it was different? What is the simplest universe that can generate<br>
systems equally complex to ours? <br>

<p>
Boredom is in some sense a defense against getting trapped in a loop. If<br>
we were never bored we would continue with our tasks ad infinitum or<br>
circumstances forced us away from them (a clear disadvantage). As a SI I<br>
woul probably want a way to regulate the "boredom threshold" of my<br>
subminds; sometimes it is a good idea to have a system that can<br>
enthusiastically go on with a task (Could you catalogue the stars of the<br>
galaxy for me, submind 348843?), sometimes it is a good idea to quickly<br>
move on to more rewarding fields (Submind 438733, take a look at the<br>
civilizations in sector 43 and tell me if anyone of them looks<br>
interesting). <br>
