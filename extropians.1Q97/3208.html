I peeked at this book at the bookstore last weekend.  I skipped ahead to<br>
the end, where they get down to the nitty gritty about what kinds of<br>
changes we might see in the next 10 or 15 years.  They predict some<br>
kind of significant social crisis shaking the country, leading to many<br>
difficult years, eventually forging a stronger social consensus (to<br>
greatly oversimplify).  The analogous point in the previous cycle was<br>
WWII, a time of trouble and testing, followed by the Pax America years<br>
of the late 40's through early 60's, with the introduction of TV, the<br>
move to the suburbs, Father Knows Best, and all the other manifestations<br>
of that confident period.<br>
<p>
Some of their advise for weathering this storm did not fit well into<br>
my own individualistic tendencies.  They advised becoming part of the<br>
community, getting a reputation as someone who is good to know, someone<br>
who helps out with local groups, etc.  Think of the people who got to<br>
be in charge of the ration coupons during WWII.<br>
<p>
This would not be an easy role for me to play!  I barely know my neighbors.<br>
I hope that a more detailed look at the book will suggest some alternative<br>
strategies.<br>
