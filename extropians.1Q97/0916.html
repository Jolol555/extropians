Pleased to meet you!<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Extropy Institute has a philosophy which strives towards spontaneous</i><br>

<i>&gt;healthy criticism.  It's a far more open system than any religion or</i><br>
<i>&gt;fundamentalist philosophy.  I like that.  However, it's been painfully</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious to me, throughout my life, how far people can get when they're</i><br>
<i>&gt;dogmatically committed towards a particular idea.  Ideas like bigotry,</i><br>
<i>&gt;fascism and censorship are incredibly rampant because they develop a</i><br>
<i>&gt;devoted and unquestioning following.  The masses flock to their</i><br>
<i>&gt;shepherd.  They're insanely bad memes, but problematically trong:</i><br>
<i>&gt;if people are more powerful when they are fundamentally committed</i><br>
<i>&gt;and when surrounded by people who agree with them, then they'll adapt</i><br>
<i>&gt;as is most advantageous to them:  conform, centralize, dogmatize.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't like any of this.  But this has been a problem that I've been</i><br>
<i>&gt;fighting with for most of my life.  I'm not here to argue that religion</i><br>
<i>&gt;is better than healthy criticism and spontaneous order.  I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt;that.  But in the face of what's out there, how can I, and others like</i><br>
<i>&gt;me, fight a meme of centralization which may be fundamentally more</i><br>
<i>&gt;powerful than the one I'm trying to spread, simply by virtue of the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the meme I'm spreading can never be a dogma?  Can this meme ever</i><br>
<i>&gt;surpass authoritarianism?</i><br>
<p>
The strength of these bad memes is more apparent than actual.  By<br>
definition, a "bad" meme is one that at some fundamental level is incorrect,<br>
inadequate, or counterproductive.  No matter how apparently strong a meme, a<br>
truly bad meme will *always* contain a weakness which can be exploited.<br>
<p>
The key to stopping the propagation of bad memes is to give the people the<br>
ability to recognize bad memes.  The problem is that many of the people who<br>
get caught up in traditionally virulent memes have neither the cognitive nor<br>
emotional fortitude to step outside the meme before becoming caught in it.<br>
Propagation of most of the worst memes goes hand in hand with ignorance.<br>
Most "Bible belt" fundamentalists I met when I was in the South were poorly<br>
educated and sadly ignorant.  Consider the "white supremecist" movement.<br>
Most of the members of that "master race" can barely read, let alone engage<br>
in rational, intelligent thought.<br>
<p>
Even the toughest bad memes fall in the face of an educated populace.  I<br>
believe the bad memes are slowly being weeded out.  The extremist backlash<br>
you may see or hear about is really the death throes of broken memes.  Many<br>
traditional virulent social memes are losing ground to "good" memes.  A<br>
truly "good" meme is always defensible and rarely cedes what it has taken.<br>
The same cannot be said of bad memes.<br>
<p>
Of course, this is just MY theory on this issue.<br>
