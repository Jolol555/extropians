<i>&gt;I think you misrepresent the "cybergnostic" position; even the most </i><br>
<i>&gt;die-hard cybergnosticist will acknowledge that the information has to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;processed somewhere (although the Moravecian platonic materialists </i><br>
<i>&gt;suggest that the processing is central, and the implementations(s) are </i><br>
<i>&gt;contingent). </i><br>
<p>
It's more the cybergnostic tone that I object to than the cybergnostic<br>
position. Or perhaps what I'm objecting to is some of the value-judgements<br>
that are often subtly embedded in presentations of the cybergnostic<br>
position? One of the things that I dislike about many forms of Christianity<br>
is their denigration of the body and sensual experience, and the sort of<br>
quietism that discourages people from working for change in the real world.<br>
It's when I see these elements popping up among cybergnostics and VR<br>
enthusiasts that I start getting suspicious. I've never seen this stuff pop<br>
up in your own discussions, but I've seen it in the work of others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; It's distressing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; see silly dualistic metaphors pervading so much talk of uploading.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes. But it may be easy to slip into it.</i><br>
<p>
One more reason why I adopt the cybergnostic perspective experimentally<br>
and not enthusiastically.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I sometimes support the cybergnostic position; I often feel my body as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;real limitation since it distracts me from my work with physical demands</i><br>
<i>&gt;and limitations, singular location, risk for damage or disease and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;subtle effects of (say) a tired muscle on my cognition. I would be very</i><br>
<i>&gt;happy to spend much of my time without it, only to use the body for what</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is truly good for: sensual exploration of the physical world. </i><br>
<p>
Okay, but what can we do that does not constitute sensual exploration<br>
of the physical world? Introspection of one kind or another seems<br>
to be it, and Buddhists consider the recursive backflow of stimuli<br>
within the brain to be the sixth sense, so even introspection can<br>
be regarded as a sensual exploration of your physical brain. I know<br>
what you're talking about: the experience of looking *through* a<br>
computer terminal instead of looking *at* a computer terminal. But<br>
the introspective ethereality of that experience does not change<br>
the fact that even the use of a terminal is a sensual exploration<br>
of the physical world.<br>
<p>
It's my opinion that I will always "have" a body, and that there<br>
will always be room for improvement in the design of my body. There<br>
will always be some kinds of petty niggling annoyances in the<br>
low-level function of my body; either I'll have to update to catch<br>
up with some arms-race somewhere (and I don't mean that to be as<br>
sinister-sounding as it is), or something will break unexpectedly<br>
and need repairing, etc. Stuff always needs to be fixed or improved.<br>
That's life. I like it that way. It's this preprogrammed willy-nilly<br>
death thing that I don't care for at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; But I can't even form a coherent notion of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; what it would be like to exist without a body. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Have you gone into a "hacker trance" or "email trance"? It sometimes</i><br>
<i>&gt;happens to me as I use a computer: everything that is outside the virtual</i><br>
<i>&gt;desktop fades away, and the world becomes information. I don't think about</i><br>
<i>&gt;my chair, how I write on the keyboard or move the mouse, I just exist as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;disembodied consciousness influencing the digital world by will alone.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is the kind of existence I would like to use in my "working mode". </i><br>
<p>
It is an appealing kind of existence for a "working mode", but I think it's<br>
really a bit of an illusion that requires a great deal of security to<br>
sustain, and that people who think they will be able to live in this state<br>
of focused, undistracted attention *all* the time are not going to be paying<br>
enough attention to their physical environment to *have* the kind of<br>
security that would permit constant immersion in this state of focused<br>
attention. But I could be wrong... I haven't thought about this particular<br>
challenge much before.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Utility fog might </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; work nicely, if it can be built.  ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A bit light, isn't it? What to do when there is a strong wind? :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would opt for a more solid mesoscale structure.</i><br>
<p>
I usually imagine the solid mesoscale bits to be relatively inanimate<br>
bits that are manipulated by (or flowed among) the masses of foglets.<br>
Also, I was thinking of this primarily as a platform for offplanet<br>
use... perhaps mostly filling up a hollowed-out asteroid (with<br>
engines, of course) for starters? I like the bush robot paradigm<br>
also, but JoSH's utility fog seems like the next step beyond that.<br>
