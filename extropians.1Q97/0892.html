<p>
come to think of it, cheetas weren't around at the time of Australopithecus<br>
either. In fact i think most big cats only developed during the last two<br>
million years, the only other big cat who might have just been around near<br>
the end of 'Lucy's' period was saber tooth tiger (smilodon). All the others<br>
had to deal with homo habilis, well capable of defending himself with spears<br>
and tools. Add to that that the later varieties of Australopithecus probably<br>
had some primitive tools already. I think early Australopithecus had to deal<br>
with far fewer predators. I'm going to look it up, but i'm almost sure that<br>
the big cats didn't develop, until the homonids were well on their way. <br>
