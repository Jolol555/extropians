<i>&gt; I really think you need to understand something at at least a basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; level before you can reject it this strongly.  Strauss &amp; Howe do give</i><br>
<i>&gt; a plausible causal influence story, they don't try to explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything, they do address geographic variation, and whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; something depresses you is no indication of whether it is true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Please either learn the basics here or say you don't know.</i><br>
<p>
This is really too much.  You described the book as "resonating" with<br>
your own feelings, offering no epistemology by which it should be<br>
properly judged, and then you criticize someone else for dismissing it<br>
based on his feelings.<br>
<p>
A few days ago, I spent about an hour reading their web stuff to<br>
determine whther or not I should read the book, and I couldn't find<br>
a single word that actually said anything.  Every paragraph looked<br>
exactly like astrological descriptions: vague, uncommitted, hedged,<br>
inspecific--a cold read.  There's not one single claim made to which<br>
specific dates and specific results--even statisical ones--are tied.<br>
There's just the right mix of disasterbation and hopefulness to make<br>
it a bestseller and no real content to make it disprovable.<br>
<p>
In short, I decided early on it would be pointless to waste valuable<br>
time, money, and brain cells on it.  This was not a matter of evaluating<br>
its merits based on depression; it was not the case that I judged it by<br>
its emotional effect; it was that I judged it by its flawed reasoning,<br>
and my emotional reaction to that evaluation followed.<br>
