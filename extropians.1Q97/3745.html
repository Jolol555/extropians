E. Shaun, you are very clearly missing the gist of this argument. This<br>
is not an argument about how someone should appreciate a work of art. We<br>
all agree that this should be left to the individual. This is not an<br>
argument about right or wrong aesthetic interpretation of art.  I<br>
believe we all agree, though an artist may have a specific intent for an<br>
opus, the artwork may be freely interpreted by the individual. This is<br>
what you so have so fondly called objective subjectivity. Call it what<br>
you will, this is the laymens approach to encountering art. <br>
<p>
This argument is about the fact that their is yet another use of art<br>
that has nothing to do with the appreciation, enjoyment, or judgement of<br>
art. It amazes me at how difficult it is for people to realize or<br>
recognize this use, even after I have explicitly stated it several<br>
times. This is the objectively scientific, or the psycho-archeological<br>
use of art. It is the non-judgemental interpretation of art, the<br>
objective observation and recording of what is explicitly present in the<br>
art. It is the corrolation of that data with the data of previously<br>
conducted scientific experiments, in order to ascertain a scientific<br>
prediction of that individual's psychological condition. The same can be<br>
done with collectives of art, e.g., the art of an organization, a<br>
society, a nation, or even a world. Archeologists very commonly use art<br>
in this fashion when studying ancient cultures. <br>
<p>
<p>
On an aside E. Shuan, I hope that you are not implying that art can only<br>
be appreciated as either good or bad. This would be an extremely shallow<br>
appreciation of art. In the same way that a person who only percieves<br>
things in life as either strong or weak, a person who only percieves a<br>
piece of artwork as either good or bad is shallow. We attain degrees of<br>
depth in perception and appreciation by being able to evaluate things<br>
from different vantages. The easiest way to do this is to increase the<br>
number of dichotomies and continuums we shift between when appreciating<br>
or analyzing something. An extremely shallow person, Joe, might only use<br>
one dichtomy, whereas a normal person, Bob, might generally shift<br>
between 2-5 dichotomies when percieving something of general interst;<br>
another person, Tim, might shift between 5-10 dichtomies, and then yet<br>
another person, a genius perhaps, Albert, might shift between 10 to even<br>
30, 40, or more dichotomies when evaluating something. This factor is<br>
one which differentiates the cognitive intelligence of people greatly.<br>
This same factor also differentiates the emotive intelligence of people<br>
greatly.<br>
<p>
Where Tom defined art as something to be created, shared, and enjoyed,<br>
you have defined art as something which either makes us feel good or<br>
bad. In your refusals to directly define art, you have simply defined it<br>
inadequately. Definitions DO NOT LIMIT things. Definitions make it<br>
possible to question the limits of things. A refusal to define something<br>
is a refusal to understand that thing deeply.  <br>
