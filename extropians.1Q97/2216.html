Well, I just arrived here from a neuroscience symposium where I heard<br>
Tulving and other Big Names discuss memory, and I'm going to do some<br>
actual *serious* (!) research in this subject, so I simply can't resist<br>
jumping into it: <br>

It didn't light up much on the scans we were shown. But I know why: this<br>
was a symposium on dyslexia, and everyone was interested in semantic<br>
memory. While there is definitely some arguments about excatly what is<br>
involved in LTM (or even if there is any clear distinction between STM and<br>
LTM) the "consensus" seems to be like this: <br>
<p>
Hippocampus and maybe parts of thalamus do the encoding of STM into LTM<br>
for *declarative memory* (i.e. the kind of memory you can tell me about,<br>
like semantic ("Kyzyl is the capital of Tuva"), episodic ("At 13.00<br>
yesterday I was watching a movie") or metamemory ("Yes, I know most of the<br>
periodic system")). Nondeclarative memory is handled by other systems,<br>
procedural memory is most likely the basal ganglia and cerebellum. It<br>
should be noted that the memories seem to be encoded in cortex, especially<br>
inferotemporal cortex (perceptual memory) and the prefrontal cortex. <br>
<p>
I have seen several scans suggesting that when you are encoding a<br>
declarative memory the left prefrontal cortex shines up (not the<br>
hippocampus, which is surprising), while during retrieval the right<br>
prefrontal cortex lit up. There are several other parts of the brain that<br>
light up, including the cerebellum, but they seem to be rather transient<br>
and variable. Most people I have talked with agree that the cerebellum is<br>
involved in a lot of things beside movement control; in fact the lateral<br>
cerebellum seems to be quite involved in verbalization (it lit up in some<br>
scans of people reading or listening). <br>
<p>
Of course, one should be a bit critical of PET and fMRI scans - they just<br>
show that something happens, not what. After all, it could be inhibiting<br>
activity or just the "shadow" of signals sent from (say) hippocampus. But<br>
they are suggestive. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And if anybody can even *begin* to explain this, I haven't heard about</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  </i><br>
<p>
Just check the literature. Things like this tend to produce amazing <br>
amounts of models...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My own guess is that the cerebellum does constraint propagation or</i><br>
<i>&gt; some other kind of constraint-to-visualization assembly, and that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; what motor skills, LTM retrieval, and (another guess) spatiotemporal</i><br>
<i>&gt; visualization have in common.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting. I personally think it does error correction, a bit like a<br>
general system for keeping neural signals on track if some kind of error<br>
can be defined. We should also remember that some of its nuclei are<br>
involved in motivation. <br>
