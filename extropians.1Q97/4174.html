Generally only an issue when a crisis occurs (famine, drought, etc.)  Even<br>
then the best options may well be recorded from the last time that happened,<br>
300 years ago.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Especially in competition with braver bands who have</i><br>

<p>
Over hundreds of years of trial, error, accident, and emergency, most bands<br>
know most of what's edible around them.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;} their members are typically very conservative as well.  This is part of</i><br>
the<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Primitive == subsistence farmers or primitive == hunter-gatherers?</i><br>
<p>
Both, really, but I was thinking of hunter-gatherers (HG), as agriculture is<br>
very recent in our evolution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Jared Diamond feels the latter are likely to be more intelligent by</i><br>
<i>&gt;culture if not by marginal evolution than humans living in more</i><br>
<i>&gt;artificial, hence nicer, environments.  Specifically that many of them</i><br>
<i>&gt;are more generally exploratory and playful than modern humans, though</i><br>
<i>&gt;outhinking a couch potato or McTourist is not difficult.</i><br>
<p>
That's an interesting speculation, but factually HG groups don't do well,<br>
even though theoretically their knowledge should give them a tremendous<br>
advantage wrt nature films, plant botany, cult leadership, nature retreats<br>
and no doubt many other things as well.  There aren't many HG, for biological<br>
reasons; I think there should be enough room in our enormous society for all<br>
of them to do well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'd suggest H-G problems stem more from massive technological</i><br>
<i>&gt;inferiority and more deadly, massive immunological inferiority leading</i><br>
<i>&gt;to societal wipeout, with which few people will deal well.  Amerinds</i><br>
<i>&gt;adapted to horses, guns, and applicable Eurasian agriculture quite</i><br>
<i>&gt;well.  Cherokee successfully adapted to US legal system, which was</i><br>
<i>&gt;ignored by Andrew "fuck the Court" Jackson.  Hard to adapt to being</i><br>
<i>&gt;outnumbered and outgunned by people willing to destroy, not conquer,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you.</i><br>
<p>
Can't argue with any of that.  The Cherokees learned everything they could<br>
from the Europeans, but their numerical inferiority was so great they hadn't<br>
a chance even against a distinct minority of US society.<br>
