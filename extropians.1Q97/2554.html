<i>        &gt;An idea which is very common in science fiction is being able</i><br>
<i>        &gt;to directly experience another person's consciousness.  This may</i><br>
<i>        &gt;be done through telepathy, through mechanically assisted mind</i><br>
<i>        &gt;reading, through some kind of upload/download process; a hundred</i><br>
<i>        &gt;different methods have probably been described.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Do you think it would ever be possible to do this, or does this</i><br>
<i>        &gt;seem like something which is fundamentally impossible?  If it</i><br>
<i>        &gt;could be done, then this could provide some insight into the</i><br>
<i>        &gt;nature of other beings' consciousness.</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
I don't see how the subjective could ever be made objective. Suppose a mind <br>
reading machine told me that when you see the color red you have same <br>
subjective experience that I do, red looks the same to you as it does for me. <br>
How could I ever know if the machine was giving me correct information? <br>
The operating principles of the machine would have to be based on some theory<br>
of consciousness, but I'd have no way of knowing if that theory was correct. <br>
      <br>
There is an even more fundamental problem. My brain is different than yours, <br>
so If I want to know what it's like to be you I'd need something that could <br>
translate the states of your brain into states that my brain could understand. <br>
If I did that then I'd know what it's like for John Clark to be Hal Finney.<br>
Unfortunately that's not what I want, and the only way for me to know what <br>
it's like for Hal Finney to be Hal Finney is to turn my brain into an exact <br>
copy of yours. Even then "I" wouldn't know what it's like to be you, because <br>
"I" wouldn't be John Clark anymore, I'd be Hal Finney.<br>
