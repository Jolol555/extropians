<i>&gt; I would disagree with your concept of property.  Inventions, techniques,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc. are patented b/c the represent the the intensive work product of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual.  To steal this workproduct without the permission of the one</i><br>
<i>&gt; who truly created it would be tantamount to taking credit for something</i><br>
<i>&gt; you did not create (plagirism or using a trademark).</i><br>
<p>
Yes, stealing work without permission is a crime; fraudulently claiming<br>
authorship or invetion is a crime; but copyrights and patents aren't<br>
aimed at those actions: they are aimed specifically at preventing, by<br>
force, the use of information legally obtained.  If I invent something,<br>
I will keep the idea under wraps with non-disclosure agreements while<br>
it is being developed, and you bet I'd prosecute anyone who broke his<br>
contract or stole from my safe.  But if I freely choose to sell the <br>
thing on the open market where anyone can see how it works, I have no<br>
right to have the government use its guns to prevent those folks from<br>
going into business against me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Not having a system of protections for these future oriented people</i><br>
<i>&gt; would give the lazy and oportunistic the right to benefit from the work</i><br>
<i>&gt; of others - not a very libertarian concept.  Besides, patents expire</i><br>
<i>&gt; (voila IBM clones) giving others the right to benefit from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; advancement, but also giving the individual(s) their just rewards.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that "a system" should do that.  I just disagree that it should<br>
be government force.  Private contracts and private technologies work.<br>
