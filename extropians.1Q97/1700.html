It can be argued that Extropianism per se doesn't make any claims about <br>
divinity, although it is clear that there is a bias against most religions <br>
due to the empirical and pancritical philosophy it encourages (personally <br>
I think that a religion that can't stand being investigated with a <br>
critical eye is suspect; it it really was true, it wouldn't have any <br>
problems with it). Your view of a pantheistic evolution fits in quite <br>
well, it is just a less common view among Extropians.<br>
<p>
The same goes for immortality. Immortality is no transhuman dogma; there <br>
are transhumanists who argue that it is impossible and/or undesirable, <br>
although they are a minority too. <br>
<p>
Is immortality possible? The question cannot be answered if one refers to <br>
immortality in the strongest sense of the word (not dying, ever) since <br>
that would require an infinite time to determine. A more reasonable <br>
versuin would ask if indefinite life is possible. But this is merely <br>
semantic gymnastics. <br>
<p>
As I see it, immortality is possible *and* impossible at the same time. <br>
There doesn't appear to exist any real limits to the lifespan of a being <br>
at a sufficiently high level of advancement (using backups etc). But <br>
living an extremely long life would by necessity lead to the accumulation <br>
of experience and changes; in order to avoid getting trapped in the <br>
Eternal Return the being would have to grow and develop. And herein lies <br>
the rub: it will grow beyond its old nature, becoming something more and <br>
different. The old self will gradually vanish, only to be continually <br>
replaced by new selves. This is a form of death that is unavoidable in <br>
order to reach true immortality. <br>
