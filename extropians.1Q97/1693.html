<p>
Beware of the word 'must', it is easy to write but does it have any <br>
backing in reality?<br>
<p>
To me it seems possible (and very undesirable) that humans could do away<br>
with most of the Earths ecology and still survive in a suitably balanced<br>
and impoverished biosphere, with a few species providing food (and some<br>
pests). See _A Torrent of Faces_ for such a dystopian scenario. <br>
<p>
Another possibility would be to move away from our current biology <br>
altogether, and becoming nanotech solar-powered autotrophs in space; the <br>
ecology of Earth would be irrelevant (and increasingly alien to the <br>
space-life). <br>
<p>
So while living in a biological community is optional, I think most <br>
people on this list agree that it is desirable to preserve biological <br>
diversity for its own sake (and other reasons). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; INFO-PSYCHOLOGY Dr. Timothy Leary wrote that "Ecology is the seductive</i><br>
<i>&gt; dinosaur science that will lead most of the post-human species to</i><br>
<i>&gt; conform to terrestrial conditions, become reasonably comfortable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; passive, robot-conditioned cyborg innsectoids directed by centralized</i><br>
<i>&gt; broadcasting systems. "  He goes on talking about adapting to a cyborg</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence. </i><br>
<p>
The problem is that Leary didn't think far enough. Why become *reasonaly*<br>
comfortable? Why does total comfort have to exclude a great ecosystem? <br>
And why would the insect-cyborgs be desirable or even efficient? I think<br>
most extropians agree that it is quite possible not only to tear down all<br>
limits to human growth and achievement, but also to the spread and<br>
diversity of life in the universe. The world isn't just the Earth, after<br>
all. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Daniel Quinn views this outmigration</i><br>
<i>&gt; of humans as sorcery, thinking that humans cannot exist outside of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological community.</i><br>
<p>
What about many city dwellers? They do not live in the biological <br>
community (at least not in the sense Quinn seems to refer to it), but <br>
still thrive (Personally I have not felt the need to leave the city for a <br>
long time; I appreciate the beauty of life in the form of the small <br>
ecosystems that exist in the city instead). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Extropians seem to me to be like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; futuristic intellectual province envisioned in Hermann Hesse's GLASS</i><br>
<i>&gt; BEAD GAME of the 24th century.   </i><br>
<p>
:-) Perhaps an apt analogy. An occasional dose of reality is always<br>
important. <br>
