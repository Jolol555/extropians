   Norwescon is an annual science fiction convention held in Seattle,<br>
March 27-30, 1997. Apparently 2 or 3 thousand people show up for this<br>
over the course of the four days.<br>
This year's 'Guests of Honor' include Robert Forward, Larry Niven,<br>
and A. E. Van Vogt.<br>
I am an invited speaker for several panels, readings and so forth, mostly<br>
on 'nanotech in space', but also on whatever else I want to talk about.<br>
One of the panels I'm on is "Realistic Interstellar Travel", along with <br>
Robert Forward  and Dana Andrews. Another is "Nanotech and the new<br>
 look in SF", which may include some of my artwork from an upcoming<br>
 video/book.<br>
<p>
There is a fairly extensive  art show at this con; if you would like to<br>
 submit art for this I can either give you the contact numbers, or contact<br>
 them for you. I see a thread on &gt;H/Extro art, but haven't been following it.<br>
