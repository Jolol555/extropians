<i>&gt;  &gt; It seems to me that people most adept at computers have generally only</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; most superficial awareness of their (and others') emotions.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
I intended to reply (and still will) to John Clark's provocative post about<br>
AI and Emotions, for I think there is a great gap in cognitive science when<br>
it comes to understanding emotional thinking. Evolutionarily ( when building<br>
a mind) it makes sense to understand it first. A feeling machine being *easy*<br>
to make, intrigues the hell out of me, and I want to know more!<br>
But wanted to point out that the above seems to ME, like a purely emotional<br>
response. [ I hope I am adept at handling emotions and computers, and get<br>
better at each as I learn more about both.]<br>
 <br>
Anders Sandberg:<br>
<i>&gt;  I disagree strongly with this. This is a pernicious myth, and has no </i><br>
<i>&gt;  basis in reality. There are just as many teachers, politicians or </i><br>
<i>&gt;  janitors with superficial awareness of emotion as computer people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
Pernicious! What a great word!<br>
Yes, I agree, it is a common ailment, thick skin, being shut down,  low EQ,<br>
whatever you want to call it! Construction workers,baseball players, cops,<br>
any field dominated by men, we could point a finger at all of them in turn<br>
and probably find evidence to support a low Emotional IQ theory.*Workaholism<br>
probably plays a much larger role in arrested developement than the type of<br>
skills being utilized.*<br>
Generalizing like this based on (?) personal experience does little good -<br>
and IMO - can harm.<br>
<p>
It is the stereotyping that I object to, a reverse of a common prejudice<br>
towards artists and women, saying  they are ALL feeling.. these false<br>
dichotomies ( as Steve's post said, will read that computer lib) only serve<br>
to create false dichotomies in people's already prejudiced minds.  A lot of<br>
this kind of Myth comes from technophobic meme spreading  &lt;IMHO&gt; where human<br>
emotion is held up as some kind of sacred cow - as if technology and emotion<br>
are incompatible. I find this entropic.<br>
