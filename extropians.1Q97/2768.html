enough has been said about emotions, creativity and development already so<br>
i'll stick to the ethical/political part.<br>

or the fun. My posting was a very general reply to some of the threads of<br>
the last few days, as well as a sort of continuation of some of the things<br>
brought up by Jim legg. <br>
<p>
Lim Legg had a serious point to make, but maybe his approach was too<br>
fundametalist socialist, and the true meaning of his words didn't come<br>
through: once you have reached a point where your income (production for<br>
profit reasons) is steadily growing, and you can control your spending<br>
pattern, then what is the use of making more money just for the sake of<br>
spending more. True freedom and happiness can be found in more things than<br>
just being able to BUY whjatever you like. It also has to do with being<br>
able to DO everything you like, sure money buys you time, but i get the<br>
feeling that some people here view spending time on non profit intended<br>
production or consumption as a waste of resources. <br>

What about problems where no market solution fits ? And still if a majority<br>
views something as a problem, and a minority views it as a good thing, the<br>
free market will rule against it ? A characteristic we oppose in the<br>
current forms of democracy. Except that in this case a minority with more<br>
money can decide for a majority with fewer money... <br>

<p>
I don't believe in zero sum, i do believe in a free market system, and in<br>
added value through production, and i'd go even further than that by saying<br>
that my life philosophy is that an increase in population will bring an<br>
increase in value to society, seeing that human resources are the greatest<br>
possible resource this planet has to offer.<br>
<p>
I however see where some 'problems' can be too big for a free market,<br>
individually based system. I see a need for a big institution (not<br>
necessarily a state) to supply education, maybe even invest in individuals,<br>
for profit reasons. I  believe in the power of a totally free market<br>
system, i just see problems in the human element of implementing it. The<br>
most important one being that humans don't see things long term (due to<br>
their limited life span)   <br>
<p>
Investing for Profit principle &amp; long term future planning.  <br>
<p>
Wether people organise in companies or social states, they create an<br>
institution that has a goal the long term increase in productivity and<br>
benefit (profit) of the company/society. problem is that in a democracy the<br>
individuals who decide over the destiny of the rest, have as main goal<br>
their own re-election. Just as the director of a company, who decides over<br>
the destiny of everybody in that company has as main goal his own personal<br>
position, he also runs the risk of being fired by the share holders. This<br>
puts great emphasis on temporary measures and policies, focussed on short<br>
term interest. the more powerful such an institution becomes the more long<br>
term focussed it's policies will become. Kind of conflicts with the anarchy<br>
part of it all doesn't it ?  <br>
    <br>
I can't help but notice a great many conflicting views coming from the same<br>
individuals on this list. Especially when it comes to long term future<br>
planning. I think it was Eric who pointed out a protection system against<br>
asteroids, how do you see a free market system taking care of problems of<br>
this scope ? No company in its right mind will invest in such a system, as<br>
it is impossible to give protection from asteroid collisions to only those<br>
who pay for that protection. Its the school book example of how the ducth<br>
state is justified: who else would build a dike to protect us from the sea ?  <br>
<p>
It might work in the Roman way of bread and circusses, as a gift from some<br>
ultra rich individual or company to placate the angry mobs. But its hyper<br>
irrational to depend on chance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I see nothing more fundamentally moral, responsible,</i><br>
life-&gt;affirming--indeed beautiful-- than the act of trade. <br>
<p>
True. The act of trade is beautiful as it makes all involved parties happy<br>
and brings them benefit.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;No motive more noble than profit.</i><br>
<p>
untrue. <br>
<p>
purely rational explanation: <br>
<p>
1) when that profit is not re-inserted into society by spending/consuming. <br>
<p>
2) profit can be made by ways that undermine the free market system.<br>
monopoly positions, patents, etc...<br>
<p>
therefore: free market system highest value: yes<br>
profit highest value: no<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You still seem to have some emotional attachment to selfless</i><br>
<i>&gt;altruism.  </i><br>
<p>
no, you mistake my ethical and rational views for emotional ones.<br>
<p>
If an individual dies of poverty, all that he could have contributed to<br>
society (and therefore to me personally) will have been lost. Given some<br>
investment this person could have been thought and given the means to<br>
provide for himself, society and the institution (company or state) reaping<br>
the benefits of that investment. problem is no current company is big<br>
enough to be interested in investtemst of such a scope. And if one ever<br>
exists, then will we not be subject to it in similar ways as we are to a<br>
state today ?<br>
<p>
I'm still in doubt wether to support a completely free society, as i see<br>
the benefits to economy and individual freedom of a smaller state or no<br>
state. But i'm also convinced of the increased benefits and possibilities<br>
of the largest possible scale of coordinated efforts of individuals. My<br>
quest is to merge those into a workable system, as i feel that without such<br>
a coordination of efforts, the economy and humanity are headed for a<br>
repetition of the dark ages. <br>
<p>
The anthill example with regards to the free market system is therefore<br>
based completely on the ancient humanist and liberal assumption that<br>
everyone will know exactly what to do an will instinctively do what is best<br>
for him/herself. I think you'll find that every ant follows orders to an<br>
extent, just like computers are told what to do by their program, a<br>
compromise between individual decisions and 'orders'. I'm now (very<br>
cautiously) toying with the idea of a system like this, which could be<br>
translated and justified to a human level by giving individuals the level<br>
of self-ownership they have proven to be capable of by acting responsably.<br>
Question remains who or what should decide in these matters ?<br>
<p>
Think about it, what place do mentally disordered people have in an anarcho<br>
capitalist society ? They can't provide for themselves, and i don't believe<br>
in peoples altruism (at least not anymore). Viewed purely rationally, a<br>
coordinated system could turn even their limited capablilties into a<br>
productive and profitable resource, making them too able to provide for<br>
themselves. An uncoordinated society is throwing away resources by the<br>
truckloads. Again the emotional side of things left completely aside.      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If there's ever anything I /can/ do for you, just offer me a fair &gt;price.</i><br>
<p>
Here's where ethics come in. Would you do everything given the price is<br>
high enough ? Would you kill a person if i offered you enough ? Would you<br>
prostitute yourself ? (not that i'm interested ;-) ) Would you willingly<br>
hurt other people for a price ?<br>
<p>
Everybody has different ethical values on what they would do for a price. A<br>
hitman, a thief, a child porn distributor, are all supplying to a demand.<br>
They value profit over their ethical views on the subject. Something which<br>
this society has condemned as being criminal, would you brand people who<br>
oppose these acts as fundamentalists ?. There are people who want to die,<br>
there are people who want to get their things stolen (to claim from<br>
insurance companies) and there are kids who will gladly prostitute<br>
themselves for money. All these acts are therefore not *by definition*<br>
violating other individuals freedom. Yet in most cases they are.   <br>
<p>
Most people value something higher than profit, im truly sorry for you if<br>
you don't.<br>
