<i>&gt; What happened is that people were informed in more vivid detail about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the conditions of life of real slaves, which convinced them that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't want to live in a state/nation/etc where those sort of things</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen to people.  Concrete facts were more persuasive that abstract</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments about what is or is not "evil" in principle.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, come now.  Do you seriously suggest that throughout the centuries<br>
of slavery in every society in the world, that the people were just<br>
/uninformed/ about what it was like?   That argument might explain why<br>
it took US consumers a while to catch on to child labor in the third<br>
world, but you can bet your last greenback that everyone in Guatemala<br>
knows exactly what goes on in a sweatshop, and they approve.  Americans<br>
always knew exactly what slavery was, just as every other enslaver in<br>
history has, they simply chose to approve of it and justify it until<br>
the moral opposition gained enough power to change it.<br>
