<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What lunar gov't?  I thought we were talking about a rebellion.  LunaCorp</i><br>
<i>&gt; starts shooting at US ships, LunaCorp is toast.</i><br>

<i>&gt; } &gt; 6 feet isn't much protection in the kind of warfare we're talking about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; } Sure it is. Read your 50's era directions on bomb shelter construction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1950's hell.  What are the depths of nuclear or meteor craters?  Can we</i><br>
<i>&gt; design earth-penetrating missiles to direct their blast downward?  Etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } Any lunar settlers would contain a high percentage of people who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; } disposessed, alienated, exiled, as who would give up living on earth if</i><br>
<i>&gt; } they didn't HAVE to? THink of this: a lunar settling corporation puts</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wow.  Read your science fiction.  Lots of starry-eyed (groan) idealists</i><br>
<i>&gt; would do so.  Well, maybe not lots, but enough to start a colony.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Heinlein's penal colony is not the only way to go.  And education and</i><br>
<i>&gt; skills have a high value in space, not brute labor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } together a deal with earth governments strapped with overpopulated</i><br>
<i>&gt; } welfare rolls to take welfarees off their hands for a set fee. The corp</i><br>
<i>&gt; } ships em to the moon and puts them to work shoveling dirt and growing</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } Sure, but you've got a population of highly  "humane" leaders who dodge</i><br>
<i>&gt; } drafts, hug trees, and avoid conflict when ever they can as decisive is</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Leaders change.  All the more so under threat.  Russia and China have</i><br>
<i>&gt; different leaders.  And your "humane" leaders are the same ones who</i><br>
<i>&gt; permanently exiled lots of welfarees.  You're not adding up here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Missiles in Earth orbit can ensure MAD with Luna -- no one's advantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Military at Luna can make MAD highly unlikely -- advantage, Earth.  </i><br>
<p>
Missiles in earth orbit also violate a number of current treaties with a<br>
number of countries. You'd have a major problem uniting everyone enough<br>
to ignore the mistrust symbolized by those treaties.<br>
<p>
A<br>
<i>&gt; small, "brain drain", colony may well be sentimental about Earth and</i><br>
<i>&gt; morally unable to wipe out 6 billion people and an ecosystem. </i><br>
<p>
You are still under the assumption that an ecosystem would be wiped out.<br>
As meteor strikes on industrial, military, and possibly population<br>
centers would not have ANY radiation (you are still making the same<br>
mistake the grounders did in Heinlein's book) there would be no toxic<br>
fallout, and no ecosystem loss. If you target a first or retaliatory<br>
strike at industry and military only, while bombarding the earth with<br>
propaganda differentiating the people from their government (you have<br>
the highest transmitter site around, being on the moon).<br>
<p>
 Resentful<br>
<i>&gt; rabble won't have much moral weight at home, else they wouldn't have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been shipped there in the first place.  True, they could have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; shipped by heartless leaders while rebelling under wimpy leaders; my</i><br>
<i>&gt; point isn't that Luna can't rebel, but that it isn't guaranteed to.</i><br>
<p>
Sure it isnt guarranteed to, however this brings to mind Carl Sagan's<br>
book Cosmos. In it is an analysis of possible evolution of power centers<br>
in the solar system in the future. This used the same game theory used<br>
to prove the unwinnable nature of nuclear war on earth. The analysis<br>
said that in any Earth/Moon power contest, the moon will win in the end.<br>
So maybe it is highly probable at worst.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Belters I don't know about.  And if anyone manages to live on Mercury</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Power Capital) or Venus ("we all live in a yellow refrigerator... and</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can't find us") ("well, you probably can, but can you hit us?")</i><br>
<i>&gt; they'll be in choice positions.</i><br>
<p>
Mercury will be like the Middle East: In a strategically poor position,<br>
but if they become the dominant energy source for the solar system, via<br>
laser and microwave transmissions, all they have to do is turn out the<br>
lights.<br>
<p>
Venus is impossible.<br>
<p>
Mars would within 100-200 years become more powerfull than Earth and the<br>
Moon, as it is higher still, terraformable( i.e. high population<br>
capacity), and within decent range of the asteroid belt, while far<br>
enough from Terra/Luna to make warfare difficult (Four weeks at 1 G<br>
acceleration/decelleration, three at constant acceleration for<br>
missiles). How Mars will jive with Belters I have no idea, but it may be<br>
rather anarchic.<br>
<p>
Jupiter and Saturn: if you stellate them via Von Neumann machine<br>
overload, their moons would be great mini systems. Ganymede and or Titan<br>
would become power centers.<br>
<p>
Neptune, Uranus, Pluto: Too small and far away. Uranus or Neptune would<br>
be good long term sources of He3 and Deuterium.<br>
