Tell Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper competitors that.  I've forgotten<br>
the details, but there was recently a trade war in which his vast slush fund<br>
subsidised what were effectively give-aways for months on end (I believe),<br>
which not only starved the other papers and drove them to the wall but had<br>
the effect (or was so intended; I don't know how effective it was) of<br>
shifting consumer loyalty/habit-of-purchase to his product.<br>
