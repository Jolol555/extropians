I would like to make a claim on the Foresight Exchange online prediction<br>
game (which based on Robin Hanson's Idea Futures) about the HIV/AIDS<br>
controversy.  Here is the proposal I made there a few days ago:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is a maverick view in the immunology community that AIDS is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; caused by the HIV virus.  This idea is most prominently associated with</i><br>
<i>&gt; virologist Peter Duesberg.  He had a book out last year, "Inventing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the AIDS Virus", which lays out his arguments.  Duesberg was a well</i><br>
<i>&gt; respected scientist until he began advocating this position, which has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been strongly rejected by most workers in the field.  (Duesberg has his</i><br>
<i>&gt; own web site at <a href="http://www.duesberg.com">http://www.duesberg.com</a>.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've had trouble framing a claim on this because of the possibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; of unexpected outcomes.  Maybe it will turn out that what we know as</i><br>
<i>&gt; AIDS is a collection of different diseases, some of which are caused by</i><br>
<i>&gt; HIV and some not.  I don't know the science well enough to make a very</i><br>
<i>&gt; technical claim.  Judging could become a matter of opinion as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So what I am thinking of is basing the claim on the idea that Duesberg</i><br>
<i>&gt; is presented in a major media story as gaining ground, his "crackpot"</i><br>
<i>&gt; views beginning to be accepted.  This could be caused by new evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; that questions the AIDS-HIV link.  I think "establishment" science would</i><br>
<i>&gt; state that the chances of this happening are very small (especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; given the recent clinical successes with anti-HIV drugs).  It is a low</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough threshold though that the claim would hopefully not be totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; pinned at 0.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe something like:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "A story will appear in Science, Nature, or the New York Times, stating</i><br>
<i>&gt; that biologist Peter Duesberg is receiving increased respect in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific community for his view that AIDS is not caused by HIV."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To keep it interesting I'd like to make the cutoff date around 2000 or 2001.</i><br>
<p>
I'd be curious for the people arguing about HIV and AIDS here to say what<br>
they think about the proposed claim.  Ideally I'd like it to be something<br>
which would make proponents and opponents of the AIDS/HIV link strongly<br>
disagree about its likelihood of coming true, while still allowing for<br>
an unambiguous judgement within about a five year period.  (We have had<br>
a lot of problems on FX with claims which turned out to be hard to judge.)<br>
<p>
What do you think?  Could you give an (informal, off the cuff) estimate of<br>
how likely you think the proposed claim is?  Suggestions for improvements<br>
would be gratefully appreciated as well.  Thanks -<br>
<p>
Hal<br>
