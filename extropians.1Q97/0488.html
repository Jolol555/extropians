 Damien said...<br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
no correlation between complexity and species longevity.   The argument seems<br>
solid.  It has little bearing, of course, on purely cultural change, which<br>
is why the Spike will be the product of memes - the `Lamarckian' units of<br>
human minds and passions - rather than the raw contest of genes.<br>
<p>
Stuart Kauffman, who represents the alternative point of view, insists that<br>
self-organisation is a hallmark of life in our universe. <br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
I say:<br>
And this conflation is close to the root of my problem with the <br>
working definition for Extropy recently floated by Romana here and on <br>
her Web site.<br>
<p>
I wrote a little essay on something I called the "Bacterium <br>
Coefficient" that I think is relevant--I'll try to find time to post <br>
it here soon. In a nutshell, I'd phrase it in this context as: <br>
"1. Is a successful monoculture a 'living system'? <br>
 2. If so, what is its level of Quality (value) compared to other 'living systems'?"<br>
<p>
It turns out to have consequences in the "art vs. survival" war.<br>
<p>
Anybody here read Pirsig's _Lila_? He posits four regimes of Quality, <br>
enough different from each other that "strong" reductionism misses 3/4 of what <br>
is going on...<br>
