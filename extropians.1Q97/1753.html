<i>&gt; My parents saw I was getting mail from Lucifer.com </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and now they think I'm in league with the devil!</i><br>
<i>&gt; A God-talking preacher friend of thiers outraged me to the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt; obscenity   with a conversation whose sole purpose seemed to be to get me</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt; do what my  parents wanted. </i><br>
<p>
Mike and everyone,<br>
<p>
I think this would be a good time to practice using the value of prayer, or<br>
quantum synchronicity if you like, to put out some hope that the family can<br>
adjust. If not then we should all feel shamed by this pending disaster. <br>
<p>
I for one hope to upload and still have a link to the quantum magic of<br>
interpersonal feelings.<br>
<p>
<p>
Best,<br>
