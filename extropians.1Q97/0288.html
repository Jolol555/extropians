<i>&gt;&gt;While exploring Hugo de Garis's web site on brain building I came</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;in an undeniably male trait. I would be interested if anyone has</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a reasonable argument against his views:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The general reasoned response to this type of statement is that it </i><br>
<i>&gt;does not take into account historical realities and is probably </i><br>
<i>&gt;heavily biased in Western Christian history.  You could bring up </i><br>
<i>&gt;examples such as (i) that Socrates and Plato were originally the </i><br>
<i>&gt;protoges of prominent female scholars (ii) that entire libraries were </i><br>
<i>&gt;burned during Christian attacks on advanced 'pagan' civilizations so </i><br>
<i>&gt;we don't have an accurate record of who their prominent thinkers </i><br>
<i>&gt;were, (iii) that one of the greatest known ancient mathematicians of </i><br>
<i>&gt;all time, Hypatia, was murdered by monks and her library burned </i><br>
<i>&gt;simply because she was a woman, and (iv) what about Marie Curie, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Countess of Lovelace, Sappho?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You could also point out that until very recently most women were </i><br>
<i>&gt;prohibited by law from attending school or even reading books, and that </i><br>
<i>&gt;these prohibitions were often enforced through beatings or commitment to </i><br>
<i>&gt;asylums.  It is believed that many women who exhibited signs of early </i><br>
<i>&gt;genius were treated as socially rebellious or mentally anamolous.   </i><br>

Excellent post!  Do you have a selection of good history sources you<br>
could share with us?<br>
