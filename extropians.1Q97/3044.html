In that it is considered to be a mystical happening ususally experienced by<br>
artists while in some stream of consciousness state, I think that there is a<br>
general trend towards admiring it from a distance. This the fallacy that I<br>
am trying to address in this thread.  In order for us to expand our thinking<br>
in multiple directions, adapting thinking patterns to develop more ceative<br>
lateral thinking patterns would prove to be an excellent tool.<br>
<p>
Let's talk "ideas."  Our ideas are what makes us unique.  Our transhuman<br>
ideas are establishing a paradigm for others.  These ideas are necessary and<br>
important, for they will become points on the compass into the future,<br>
rather than going into the future pell mell.  There is value in seeing -<br>
paying attention to - the creative act.  There is value in ideas.  There is<br>
also value in putting ideas into action.<br>
<p>
The skill of creative thinking just doesn't happen.  Although, one might<br>
have an innate inclination towards being orginally creative, most people<br>
have to work at it. <br>
