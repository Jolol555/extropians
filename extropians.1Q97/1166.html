David Musick was speculating about how a computer would have, or could<br>
have emotions.  I recommend a book by Yale CS prof David Gelernter<br>
called "The Muse in the Machine: Computerizing the Poetry of Human<br>
Thought", FreePress, 1994, in print @$22.95.  He suggest a model for giving <br>
AIs emotions, religion, and even hallucinations.<br>
<p>
Gelernter's basic argument is that types of human thinking can be laid <br>
out in a continuous spectrum, from what he calls 'high focus' at one end to<br>
'low focus' at the other.  He says that at the high focus end thought is<br>
logical and penetrating, that the mind might move from one thought to <br>
another according to logical connections, and at the lower end the mind<br>
move from one thought to another according to emotional connections.<br>
<p>
While I doubt that this is really how the human mind works ( it seems<br>
odd for a fuzzy neural net to function along a linear scale ), it does<br>
describe a relatively simple way of emulating emotions in an AI.<br>
<p>
BTW, I wouldn't reccomend buying the book; Gelernter goes off on a<br>
religious tangent many times which spoils it as a whole work.  But <br>
the first 3 chapters contain the gist of the idea - a mere 64 pages<br>
which can be read while browsing in a bookstore or library.<br>
