Why do people look try to define "life", as though it was some simple <br>
property?  I think it is ridiculous to try to divide the movements and <br>
interactions in this vast universe into "living" and "non-living" systems.  <br>
Each system that is studied should be studied for the particular properties it <br>
exhibits.  For example, when studying mules, their lack of reproductive <br>
ability should be noted, as well as their metabolizing ability, as well as <br>
their parentage, as well as their cells, as well as many many other details, <br>
classifying the system as either "living" or "non-living" adds nothing to our <br>
understanding of the system.  We can study viruses and analyze their molecular <br>
structure and the way they interact with other systems and how certain types <br>
of interactions result in more of the same type of system, but whether we call <br>
it "living" or "non-living" is irrelevant to the virus' actual properties.  We <br>
can notice similarities among systems, such as having cells and DNA or being <br>
mobile, or using ATP to store energy, but I think it is useless to try to put <br>
all these systems into one, single category which they, and only they, belong <br>
in.  Doing so does not really help us understand any particular systems in the <br>
universe.<br>
<p>
Sometimes categorizing things is useful, sometimes it's not.  Categorizing <br>
systems into "living" or "non-living" is utterly useless.  It adds no useful <br>
information or generalizations to systems.  Besides, the whole idea that there <br>
is a singular quality that marks a system as lving or non-living is bogus; it <br>
is a relic from the days when people beleived there was a mystical <br>
"life-force" in living things. (Which, apparantly, is still today.  Oh, well.)<br>
<p>
By the way, "conscious being", "sentient" and "mind" are other examples of <br>
useless categories, for pretty much the same reason.<br>
