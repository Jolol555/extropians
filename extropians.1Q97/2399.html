In a message dated 97-02-08 13:47:04 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 You want socialized medicine and you call yourself an extropian? The FAQ<br>
 says something about that. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
- I think this question is a misrepresentaion of the FAQ. <br>
<p>
This is about personal freedom and self responsibility. One of the more<br>
appealing things to me about anarcho capitalism, is that it will allow for<br>
people to set up non mandatory socialist/communal situations as long as they<br>
do not force anyone else to do so.<br>
To say "you call you yourself an Extropian , but you don't want (pick a meme:<br>
going into outer space, uploading, libertariansm, atheism, smart drugs,<br>
longevity, whatever)"  it reminds one  of a "party line", and exclusionary,<br>
closed circle thinking. Some pople may agree on some principles and not<br>
others, this is a phiosophy- not a set of doctrines, a religion or written in<br>
stone dogma.<br>
I agree that free market is proper for developing technology - seems pretty<br>
obvious to me,  but I rahter _strongly_disagree with telling other people<br>
what "Extropians" can think or not.<br>
<p>
ON WITH THE AUTOMORPH!!!<br>
