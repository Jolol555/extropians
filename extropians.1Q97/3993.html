I'm already thinking about countermeasures, and am wondering if this<br>
isn't just a little bit hyped here. This idea works provided the disk is<br>
spinning at a constant speed, but aren't most HD motor servo controlled,<br>
so the velocity is always wandering back and forth??<br>
<p>
Not that it matters very much. I realized long ago that the only secure<br>
storage is in my head, and I don't have much that needs that kind of<br>
security. Moderately sensitive stuff goes on floppies or gets<br>
encrypted....<br>
