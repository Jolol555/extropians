<i>&gt; As an expert of widget manufacturing  I can form 3 conclusions. 1)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Widgets are expensive to make, if you're giving them away you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; lousing   </i><br>
<i>&gt;    a ton of money.</i><br>
<p>
In the scenario I presented, I did not propose that I *would* give<br>
them away for free, but merely that my available resources were such<br>
that I COULD do so without going broke.  What I proposed was<br>
lowering the price to a level that would not allow you to compete<br>
and still remain profitable.  I would lose money, but would not <br>
willingly incur any greater losses than were necessary.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Widgets will not be free forever. </i><br>
<p>
That's the point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) I hope you are very stubborn and I hope you're corporation has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; LOT of   </i><br>
<i>&gt;    money.</i><br>
<p>
That is two of the preconditions for the thought experiment.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I buy (not the right word really, they're free) widgets by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; warehouse full from you, if you can make them I will buy them and</i><br>
<i>&gt; then ask for more. Now that demand is so huge you MUST build more</i><br>
<i>&gt; widget factories if they are to remain free or even just cheap, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; after you finished that factory you must build another one and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; another. When the day comes when you regain your sanity or just go</i><br>
<i>&gt; broke I will have a huge supply of widgets that cost  me nothing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; obtain that I can sell for many years at an enormous profit.</i><br>
<p>
This presupposes starting conditions that are significantly different<br>
from my proposed scenario.  For this to work you would have to have<br>
enough reserve resources, or a large enough alternative source of<br>
revenue to go without profit while continuing to spend money for an<br>
extended period of time, and I would have to have to be limited<br>
enough in my resources that the losses on widgets would threaten my<br>
economic survival.  In the proposed scenario, I am the one with the<br>
vast resources.  You also assume that you could buy my widgets for<br>
less than what it would cost you to make your own.  This isn't<br>
necessarily the case.  All that is required to drive you out of<br>
business is for me to sell them below your total cost including<br>
marketing and distribution, they do not have to be priced below your<br>
manufacturing cost.  Even if you buy them from me you still have to<br>
market and distribute them.  Not a good situation for a company with <br>
little reserve capital and no other source of income.<br>
<p>
My point in all of this was not to suggest that this kind of thing <br>
would happen at every possible opportunity, but merely that it can <br>
happen and does represent a flaw in pure free market economies.  A <br>
flaw that would be better addressed than ignored.<br>
<p>
                                        Peace,<br>
                                        William Kitchen<br>
