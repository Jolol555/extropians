<p>
I wonder if that relationship between internal philosophy and external <br>
expression is easier to achieve in the visual arts.  In the realm of <br>
verbal expression, achieving continuity and plot coherence can lead <br>
to conflict over personal ideals versus remaining true to the central <br>
vision of the piece.  The dilemma becomes more intense if the story <br>
itself leads in a previously unseen direction that reveals something <br>
negative about a cherished idea.  <br>
<p>
Allow me to illustrate by using as an example the story I am writing.  <br>
In it there are three characters, two human and one transhuman.  As a <br>
group they encounter a particular danger, and frankly, things don't go <br>
well for them.  The temptation for me would be to spare the transhuman <br>
character through his utilizing a special ability.  In order to maintain <br>
the coherence and value of the story, however, it is required that he <br>
use that special ability to cope with the experience rather than to <br>
escape it.  The very act of moving forward in time with the storyline <br>
compels me to face the consequences of the plot and to maintain its <br>
veracity, regardless of my personal feelings regarding it.<br>
<p>
