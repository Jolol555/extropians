Those of you who want to explore further the relationship between<br>
environmentalism and Extropianism might find useful a very early<br>
consideration of that topic, in "Wisdomism:  A Moral Theory for the Age of<br>
Information" 2 EXTROPY 22 (Winter 1988-89).  Here's a quote:<br>
<p>
     First of all, let me note that most of Wisdomism's tenets will<br>
correspond quite nicely to the moral intuitions that most of us already<br>
possess. This was demonstrated above, in the discussion of Wisdomism's rules<br>
of thumb. Wisdomism will never ask us to sacrifice our planet to alien<br>
civilian engineers, for example, because it recognizes the disposition for<br>
egoistim [sic] as a wonderful means of advancing wisdom. Note secondly that<br>
moral intuitions don't always  favor the interests of our bodies and brains,<br>
as is evident in many current moral debates. The environmentalist movement,<br>
for example, has been initated by people who feel a deep empathy for vastly<br>
complex, efficient and information rich ecosystems. It shows particular<br>
concern for the wisest of non-human animals: dolphins and whales. We might<br>
say that environmentalists value the wisdom of Nature, a wisdom they feel<br>
they share. Animal rights activists and vegetarians likewise object to what<br>
they see as the needless destruction of their kin. All of these parties feel<br>
moral obligations to consider the interests of other information processing<br>
systems with which they share certain traits. It should not prove too<br>
suprising if Wisdomism asks us to do the same.<br>

I'm not sure that I would say the same thing today; I would at a minimum<br>
rephrase it.  I'm thus revising the article for republication.  Keep an eye<br>
on the T0Mpage.<br>
