CLUELESS IN SEATTLE<br>
<p>
A helicopter was flying around above Seattle yesterday when an <br>
electrical<br>
malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic navigation and<br>
communications equipment. Due to the clouds and haze, the pilot could <br>
not<br>
determine the helicopter's position and course to steer to the airport.<br>
The pilot saw a tall building sticking out above the clouds, flew <br>
toward<br>
it, circled, drew a handwritten sign, and held it in the helicopter's<br>
window. The pilot's sign said "WHERE AM I?" in large letters.<br>
People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a <br>
large<br>
sign, and held it in a building window. Their sign said "YOU ARE IN A<br>
HELICOPTER."<br>
The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his map, determined the course to <br>
steer<br>
to SEATAC airport, and landed safely. After they were on the ground, <br>
the<br>
copilot asked the pilot how the "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER" sign helped<br>
determine their position.<br>
The pilot responded "I knew that had to be the MICROSOFT building <br>
because,<br>
similar to their help-lines, they gave me a technically correct, but<br>
completely useless answer."<br>
