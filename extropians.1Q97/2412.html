I wasn't attempting to deliberately misrepresent your position.  I was<br>
just attempting to make the point that, in your version of the Universe,<br>
people assign value for completely traceable causal reasons.  The only<br>
question is whether the reasons are traceable to reason or evolution. <br>
You say that if traceable to reason, they are "imposed"; if to<br>
evolution, they are "free".  I say exactly the reverse.<br>
<p>
I have chosen to identify with my reason, rather than my<br>
evolution-imposed emotions.  What I decide to do, is me.  A "chain" of<br>
reason, no matter how inexorable, simply makes me inexorably correct; it<br>
imposes *nothing* on me that I do not believe to be right.  Evolution<br>
isn't as polite.<br>
<p>
You appear to have chosen to identify with your heart.  What you want to<br>
do, is you.  An emotion, no matter how overpowering, simply makes you<br>
overpowering; it imposes *nothing* on you that you do not want.  Reason<br>
isn't as polite.<br>
<p>
I take it back.  This isn't a dispute over semantics or circular belief<br>
systems; we are genuinely living in different strata of the Universe,<br>
and neither of us is missing the obvious.  We identify with different<br>
parts of our selves.<br>
<p>
I hope that I, my reason, will eventually assign non-subjunctive<br>
positive value to something.  I don't want my emotions assigning<br>
positive value to things that aren't really worth anything.<br>
<p>
You, your emotions, already assign positive value to anything you want. <br>
You just don't want reason to get in your way.<br>
<p>
Who says all is computation, and all else is superstition?<br>
Who says Church-Turing is simply too restrictive?<br>
Who is an atheist?<br>
Who respects faith?<br>
Who thinks consciousness is just information?<br>
Who thinks qualia just don't compute?<br>
<p>
Lord, thy name is irony.<br>
