 It's possible to find some deeper evolutionary reasons.<br>
Irwin Silverman and Marion Eals, in a paper in _The Adapted Mind_ (ed.<br>
by Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby), assumed that the differences in cognitive<br>
abilities between the sexes were a result of specializations for hunting<br>
in men and foraging in women. They were able to use this hypothesis to<br>
construct a test of cognitive spatial abilities on which women scored<br>
significantly higher than men (it emphasized memorizing the locations<br>
of a large number of different objects).<br>
 So it appears that we can create a definition of genius for which a<br>
majority of geniuses are female. But it isn't obvious that what such a<br>
definition captures is as valuable as what the standard definition<br>
captures.<br>
