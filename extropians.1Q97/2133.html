From: Eliezer Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Ah.  Then given 64 qb, you could search every 1000 consecutive digits of</i><br>
<i>&gt; pi for hidden messages for the first sixteen billion billion digits of</i><br>
<i>&gt; pi, in (of course) the same time it would take to search any 1000</i><br>
<i>&gt; digits.</i><br>
<p>
I need to learn more about how quantum computers would work, but I don't<br>
think it is quite this easy.<br>
<p>
I understand that there have been some algorithms proposed which speed<br>
up search operations on a quantum computer.  The main reference which<br>
I have seen mentioned is Grover, "A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for<br>
database search", Proceedings of STOC96.  I haven't read this paper,<br>
but I've seen it summarized as follows:<br>
<p>
You want to search a database of N items for one of S items which<br>
satisfies some criterion.  Normal search would require about N/S checks.<br>
(For example, there are 100 items, and 4 of them are good; you'll<br>
have to check about 25 items before finding a good one.)  Grover's<br>
quantum algorithm does it with the square root of this many checks.<br>
(Your computer would only have to check about 5 items using quantum<br>
parallelism in this example.)<br>
<p>
This is a considerable speedup but is not fully parallelized in<br>
the naive sense.  We might think of a quantum computer as one which<br>
simultaneously checks every possibility.  In that latter case it should<br>
take just one fully-parallel check.  We don't get that, but we do get<br>
a speedup.<br>
<p>
It's not clear a priori that the problem of searching for patterns in that<br>
huge chunk of pi matches Grover's formulation, but even if it does then<br>
it would take 2^32 checks (compared to 2^64 on a conventional computer)<br>
or four billion times longer than is stated above.  That's still a lot<br>
faster than doing it without quantum parallelism, of course, but it's<br>
not as dramatic as what was described.<br>
<p>
Also, I think you will need a lot more than a single 64 qubit register<br>
to execute the calculation.  This register, as I understand the proposal,<br>
is an index which specifies which block of 1000 digits in pi's expansion<br>
to test.  But the test itself is undoubtedly a complicated mathematical<br>
program.  I would expect that considerably more storage space will be<br>
needed to represent all the intermediate values needed for the algorithm.<br>
<p>
So, while quantum computers will be remarkable things if they can be<br>
built, we should try to keep a sense of realism in terms of what they<br>
will be able to do.  They don't give us full access to the Everett<br>
multiplex.  Tricky algorithms can give us some speedups, but there are<br>
many limitations at present.<br>
