You sound like a Buddhist to me.  The exercises and disciplines <br>
you have been describing amount to the same thing as Buddhism.  <br>
But you are also a Mormon, even if you don't "believe" it anymore;  <br>
and also a secular Jew, like everybody who grows up watching TV.  <br>
Extropianism, BTW, amounts to the same thing as secular Judaism.  <br>
<p>
You are probably right about the multiple personality bit.  I think <br>
we all have multiple personalities, it comes with the territory, you are <br>
just more aware of it than most people.  <br>
