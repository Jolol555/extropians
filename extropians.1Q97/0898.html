Analysis of the structure of fitness landscapes and its implications<br>
occupies Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 4 considers adaptive evolution in the<br>
space of possible proteins. Here we find that it is possible to to<br>
construct statistical models of molecular fitness landscapes which apply<br>
to the rapid protein evolution seen in maturation in of the immune<br>
response. But protein evolution to carry out progressively different<br>
catalytic functions drives us to conceive of an abstract catalytic _task<br>
space_. Among the surprising implications of this view is the possibility<br>
that a finite number of enzymes can carry out all enzymatic tasks: An<br>
universal enzyme toolbox is possible. Remarkably, about 100 000 000<br>
protoenzymes may well constitute such a universal toolbox, and the immune<br>
repertoire of about 100 000 000 variant antibody molecules is probably<br>
also a universal toolbox. These possibilities lead me, in Chapter 4, to<br>
discuss what might become a vastly important new arena of biotechnology:<br>
applied molecular evolution. I believe we are now crossing the threshold<br>
into an era where it shall become possible to evolve biopolymers that act<br>
as vaccines, drugs, enzymes, biosensors, and so forth, serving a wide<br>
range of practical medical and other functions.<br>
<p>
Chapter 5 and 6 present evidence for adaptation to the edge of chaos both<br>
_within_ single complex systems and _between_ the linked members of a<br>
coevolving system. Chapter 5 investigates the emergence of spontaneously<br>
ordered behaviour in parallel-processing systems and elucidates the three<br>
broad regimes which occur in such systems: ordered, complex, and chaotic.<br>
Here we encounter our first powerful example of spontaneous order.<br>
Contrary to intuition, even randomly constructed networks of elements<br>
which turn one another on and off according to complex rules can exhibit<br>
extremely ordered behaviour. This _ordered_ regime is characterized by<br>
the formation of a large connected set of elements of the system that<br>
freeze into fixed activity states. This frozen component percolates<br>
(spans) across the system and leaves behind isolated unfrozen islands<br>
free to vary activities in complex ways. The _chaotic_ regime corresponds<br>
to the case where the frozen component does not percolate across the<br>
system. Rather, the unfrozen component spans the system, leaving behind<br>
isolated frozen islands embedded in the fluctuating sea. Transition bakc<br>
and forth between these two regimes corresponds to a phase transition at<br>
which the frozen component begins to melt and the fluctuating sea<br>
[quiddity? -- 'gene] begins to coalesce; this phase-transition region is<br>
the _complex_ regime. The most complex but controllable behaviour arises<br>
in parallel-processing systems poised in this complex regime on the<br>
boundary between order and chaos [now this sounds like elric m. -- 'gene].<br>
<p>
I hold that the exorbitant order of the ordered regime underlies the<br>
evolutionary emergence of order in ontogeny -- that spontaneous order<br>
lies to hand, free, as it were, for selection's further molding. In<br>
particular, asking what form such molding may take and what laws might<br>
govern it leads us to to the hypothesis that the target which selection<br>
achieves is complex systems poised in the complex regime on the boundary<br>
between order and chaos. Such systems, it begins to appear, harbor<br>
behaviour which is the most flexible, complex, and adaptable. If so, we<br>
may have uncovered an universal in biology relating the mutual<br>
implications and interpretations, the true marriage, of self-organisation<br>
and selection: Selection, in attaining complex systems, may build toward<br>
and sustain a characteristic poised order, an entire ensemble coursing<br>
back and forth along a high-dimensional boundary between order and<br>
disorder. Then further selection would be unable to avoid the typical<br>
features of this poised ensemble, which generic features would emerge as<br>
additional potential biologic universals.<br>
<p>
Chapter 6 examines coevolution. Here we find evidence of a selective<br>
metadynamics which may lead coevolving systems to the edge of chaos. I<br>
ask in this chapter what the implications for coevolution may be of the<br>
ruggedness of the fitness landscapes of each of the partners, and of how<br>
much an adaptive move by one partner deforms the landscapes of others. We<br>
are led to provocative results. If landscapes are too smooth compared<br>
with the landscape deformation caused by partners, then each partner can<br>
hardly respond by increasing fitness as other partners move. The entire<br>
system is chaotic. Sustained fitness is low because the landscape of each<br>
partner is drastically altered, typically casting the partner to low<br>
fitness, by the moves of its coevolving partners. If landscapes are too<br>
rugged compared with the deformation caused by others, then all partners<br>
rapidly freeze into fixed but poor compromise phenotypes. Again,<br>
sustained fitness is low. Just at the boundary between frozen order and<br>
chaotic wandering, just at the edge of chaos when some, but not all,<br>
partners cease changing and form a percolating frozen component, leaving<br>
isolated islands of partners that continue to coevolve and change, the<br>
coevolving system attains a structure where all partners attain the<br>
highest expected sustained fitness. Adaptation, through a selective<br>
metadynamics altering landscape structure and landscape deformation,<br>
again attains the edge of chaos.<br>
<p>
In summary, Part I investigates the mutual implications of<br>
self-organization and selection for adaptive evolution. We ask what the<br>
conditions are within and between evolving entities which permit adaptive<br>
evolution, and whether the attainment of those conditions is itself a<br>
lawful consequence of selection's operation. The tentative answer, to be<br>
held as working hypothesis at this stage, is that at levels within<br>
organisms which must coordinate complex tasks, within evolving<br>
populations, and within coevolving systems, selection attains a<br>
near-universal poised state hovering between unexpected, profound<br>
spontaneous order and the incoherence of chaos. Borrowing a culminating<br>
phrase from my colleagues N. Packard and C. Langton, life exists at the<br>
edge of chaos.<br>
