<p>
Here's how I did it.  My trusty chart of the 1958 ICAO Standard Atmosphere<br>
says that about 10^-10 of the mass of the atmosphere is above 150 km.  I<br>
assumed that all the air above that height was expanding freely horizontally<br>
into vacuum, which would give it a velocity equal to the speed of sound, or<br>
282 m/s at that altitude.  Thus, 10^-10 of the atmosphere disappears in a<br>
time equal to the time required for sound to cross the width of the ring.<br>
The rest is multiplication.  (hmmm... missed a factor of two there; should<br>
be half the width of the ring, because it's spilling off both sides.) <br>
<p>
Obviously the dynamics of the gas is a little more complex than this.  But I<br>
don't think I'm off by more than a small factor.<br>
