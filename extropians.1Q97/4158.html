Oh, I have considered it, and I've come up with a negative.  I think<br>
that the memes of several property, rule of law, and trade, quaint<br>
though they may sound to your ears, are 'forced moves' in cultural design<br>
space,*especially* if we are talking about the possibility of  bringing<br>
about a technologically advanced culture.  Analogous to the way, say,<br>
that having bilateral symmetry and sexual reproduction are 'forced moves'<br>
in biological design space. <br>
<p>
Anything beyond that is beyond the concept of society and civilisation altogether, <br>
and so advanced even Marx couldn't have conceived it.<br>
<p>
You see, for me, most of the problems in society arise from lack of<br>
observation of those principles, and to me social progress consists in a<br>
gradual refinement, extension and improving realisation of those memes. <br>
We have *hardly even begun* to do this, and look at the curve of<br>
progress in that short time, despite enormous ideological resistance<br>
these past two centuries!<br>
<p>
I think Vernor Vinge is a more accurate prediction than Ian Banks (much<br>
as I enjoy Ian Banks!)<br>
