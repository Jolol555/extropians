That's certainly what it tries to achieve, but I fear that Lojban's<br>
goal, a cultureless language, are logically impossible.  It takes a<br>
particular cultural point of view to banish all cultural points of view.<br>
It takes a huge cultural assumption to assume that Lojban is even<br>
"logical," from a philosophical point of view.  (That's one of the<br>
points I find appealing about pancritical rationalism.)  Ultimately, as<br>
long as logic is under debate, rationalism itself must heave under its<br>
own cultural baggage.<br>

<i>&gt; The fact that its grammar and phonology are unambiguous (though</i><br>

<i>&gt; Not only by voice but for things like searching hypertexts where</i><br>

<i>&gt; is always parseable.</i><br>
<p>
While this is interesting, I'm not sure it's enough to make the language<br>
useful.  We can teach a computer the rules of English almost as easily<br>
as we can teach the rules of Lojban, but that's not quite enough to get<br>
the full meaning across.<br>
