Most people in general are not. Mathemeticians are NOT inherently<br>
unattractive. YOU seem to find them so. Maybe some other people do too. I'd<br>
like to mention that when I posted that some people are primarily attracted<br>
to mathemeticians, I wasn't just pulling your chain. For at least ten years<br>
I was only attracted to dark-haired midwesterners who had at some point<br>
been professors of mathematics. I'm not that weird, either; the ones I met<br>
were good-looking, all but one had all their hair, they were smart, patient<br>
and funny. It's ok with me if you aren't attracted to mathemeticians, I'd<br>
just like you to know that your assumption that your tastes are general<br>
could be reworked.<br>
