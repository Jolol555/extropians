   The latest and most exciting development in ATR's CAM-Brain Project is<br>
   the very recent (September 96) brainstorming work with an American<br>
   based hardware designer on the so-called "CAM-Brain Machine (CBM)",<br>
   which should be implemented by summer of 97, to evolve neural net<br>
   modules in less than a second (with a genetic algorithm population of<br>
   100 and with 100 generations or so). If this project is approved by<br>
   ATR management, this section will be updated in greater detail. The<br>
   excitement comes from the realisation that a CBM will make brain<br>
   building (i.e. evolving a million neural net modules and putting them<br>
   together into artificial brains) practical and realistic. For the past<br>
   few years, the general reaction to the CAM-Brain Project has been one<br>
   of "wait and see, tinged with a bit of scepticism, due to the large<br>
   numbers of neurons mentioned (i.e. a billion)". CBMs will change all<br>
   this. Personally, I believe that CBMs will give birth to a new<br>
   industry - artificial brains, brain-like computers. I am very excited.<br>
<p>
UPDATE 24 December 1996<br>
<p>
   A contract between ATR and Dr. Mikhail KORKIN was signed Xmas Eve,<br>
   1996. A prototype version of CBM will be delivered by April 1997, and<br>
   if it passes appropriate feasibility tests, the full machine should be<br>
   delivered to ATR by the end of 1997. This machine will be based on<br>
   Xilinx's XC6264 chips, and will evolve a neural net module in a<br>
   fraction of a second, thus making brain building practical.<br>
