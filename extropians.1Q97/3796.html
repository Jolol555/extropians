<i>&gt; Nor are their records on respect for any sort of human rights at all</i><br>
<i>&gt; what an individualist would call "civilized".</i><br>
<p>
True enough.  They aren't good examples, but the insidious meme of<br>
IP is so pervasive that there aren't any good examples.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The United States had no such laws before the USPTO was created.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wrong. Read your US Constitution. </i><br>
<p>
Go back to civics 101.  The constitution authorized congress to<br>
create such laws.  It did not in fact do so until many years later<br>
with the creation of the USPTO.  Until then, there were thriving<br>
publishing and manufacturing industries without the subsidies of<br>
copyrights and patents.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sounds like an intellectual property version of the old rule </i><br>
<i>&gt; that stated that blacks were 2/3 human. Sorry it doesn't wash. </i><br>
<p>
Huh?  I don't understand what the hell you're talking about here,<br>
soI can't even hope to reply.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Patents and copyrights are merely government recognition of original</i><br>
<i>&gt; work and an agreement to enforce protection of the inventors creation</i><br>
<i>&gt; from license violations, much as trademarks are protected from</i><br>
<i>&gt; fraudulent claims.</i><br>
<p>
The fact that you confuse trademarks and licensing with copyrights and<br>
patents is a symptom of the problem.  Look at the objective realities,<br>
not the propaganda: If I use your name, I commit fraud.  That's a<br>
trademark.  If I break a contract with you, that's an enforceable tort.<br>
If I reprint a chapter from a book you wrote--and which you freely<br>
chose to publish on the open market with no disclaimers or licenses<br>
or physical protection of any sort--and not claiming that it's mine,<br>
I have not committed fraud, I have breached no contract that I signed,<br>
I have merely used information that I got through non-coercive means<br>
for my own benefit, and the government will come in--at my expense<br>
as well as yours--and prosecute me for it.  That's a copyright (and<br>
similarly for patents).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your argument is irrational and typical of the hacker ethic that whats</i><br>
<i>&gt; mine is mine and whatever I can crack, pry up, steal, or defraud from</i><br>
<i>&gt; people is mine.</i><br>
<p>
Tie that slander to reality.  I make no claim to anything that is not<br>
mine and never have.  In fact, I have made my honest living for 15 years<br>
as a computer programmer and writer--a producer of intellectual property.<br>
I respect that my employers believe in those laws, but I still refuse<br>
to participate in my own name, because I can see beyond the justifications<br>
and the propaganda.  I don't want to steal or defraud--I simply refuse<br>
to be an accessory to the government's denying people the right to use<br>
what I have freely given them.  If I want to keep my inventions, I will<br>
protect them myself, and pay for the technologies and contracts to do it.<br>
I cannot in good conscience demand the government get out of my life in<br>
one respect, and then come to my benefit in another.  it is dishonest,<br>
and hypocritical, and I will have none of it.  <br>
<p>
I choose not to violate the copyrights or patents of others, because<br>
they have chosen to release works into a system that makes those<br>
assumptions.  But that doesn't mean I won't speak out for a free-market<br>
non-coercive means of doing business in information, just as I speak<br>
out for free-market means of doing everything else big brother want<br>
to do for me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When the state derives its authority from that granted by its citizens,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as ours is by the constitution, then it is not begging, it is a mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt; aid compact.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, yeah, the social contract, blah, blah.  Funny how libertarians<br>
reject such arguments for protecting real property, but are willing to<br>
allow it for IP.  It's inconsistent.   If you want to open a set of<br>
bookstores where everyone who buys agrees to respect authors' monopoly,<br>
and you don't sell to anyone who doesn't agree, then I'll be happy for<br>
you.  That might well encourage authors to publish works only in that<br>
set of stores, giving them a market advantage.  I'd be all for it.<br>
