I guess Europe is integrating towards a european standard, and i was<br>
looking at it from countries that were more socialist than yours before ?<br>
The socialist ones  decreasing their socialism, the more capitalist ones<br>
increasing their socialist politics.<br>
<p>
Education is a very difficult subject. I quit my studies to be a history<br>
teacher partly for this reason (history in schools is used for many things<br>
it shouldn't be used for, it keeps many outdated  social processes alive)  <br>
<p>
I'm sure a system of private education can tremendously increase<br>
productivity, as such a system would increase innovation times. <br>
<p>
I see one problem: Social Mobility is one of the greatest productive forces<br>
in our society. It is how the most suitable people get to fullfill the<br>
right place in society. Take this away completely and i'm sure any society<br>
will see the ECONOMIC consequences. <br>
<p>
I'n The Netherlands they have one famous (expensive) Private school, Many<br>
of the top functions in bussiness require graduation from this school. I<br>
estimate about 10% of the people who graduate from these schools get these<br>
functions (and hold them). The other 90% was subject to this expression: <br>
<p>
'too stupid to study, yet too rich not to study...' <br>
<p>
&lt;irony&gt;<br>
Maybe social mobility could be guaranteed by having the six year old from a<br>
poor family who wants an education, sign a contract with the school, where<br>
he will work 20 years to pay off his debts to them. That would surely<br>
increase individual freedom would it ? As you would have a CHOICE between<br>
staying stupid, or becoming a contract labourer.  <br>
&lt;irony&gt;<br>
<p>
Problem is that six year old could very well be the next einstein, but we<br>
will never know in a system you advocate. I agree with you that our current<br>
state education doesn't work, and indeed is indoctrinated, by all posible<br>
ideas the state advocates, not just stimulating socialism, but nationalism,<br>
far beyond what is needed for national identity. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As to health care, public spending on it has not declined in Norway, but some</i><br>
<i>&gt;more private clinics have come into being. But those few who can afford to</i><br>
pay<br>
<i>&gt;instead of waiting for years in the public system, are being looked down</i><br>
on and<br>
<i>&gt;considered unsolidaric. One newspaper compared private clinics to</i><br>
prostitution;<br>
<p>
My personal ethics on this:<br>
<p>
If you worked for your (loads of) money yourself, you have all rights to<br>
enjoy its benefits, as you have proven to be an invaluable exponent of your<br>
society. <br>
<p>
If however you are a stupid f*ck, who has never worked one day in his life,<br>
but has rich parents, or fell onto some money some other way than by<br>
his/her own ingenuity. Please get in line with the rest and run the same<br>
risk of dying in the process of doing so. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The national budget has a surplus of many billions because of the oil, and</i><br>
these are being saved to ensure pensions in the future. <br>
<p>
That's what you think, they'll increasingly go to Europe, unless your state<br>
wants to get completely isolated economically that is. If your state is to<br>
save any of that money for its people: Distribute it now over all your<br>
citizens... Or better still: INVEST it in infrascructure, less you become<br>
the perifery of Europe. (tunnel ?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; when a commercial national TV station finally was allowed, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;public broadcasting created a second channel and is going to raise the TV</i><br>
<i>&gt;tax (a tax for *owning* a TV set). Until 1992 there was only one TV channel</i><br>
<i>&gt;available to everyone, and it has been controlled by the Labor Party and has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been instrumental in normalizing the population as social democrats.</i><br>
<p>
Yep same thing happened in most of europe, also what happened eventually<br>
was even with the increased govt support, the national tv channels couldn't<br>
compete. The only thing that still the most watched program is the national<br>
channels NEWS. <br>
<p>
Germany has interesting anti monopoly laws on this: I think one tv channel<br>
cannot own a similar second channel. Very interesting to avoid populist<br>
situations like those that happened in Italy of late...  <br>
<p>
I wonder how many US companies contribute to both presidential canditates<br>
campaign, in exhange for state contracts ?<br>
<p>
I think free trade is the best way to go, but i also think taking only half<br>
steps towards a political system (ie in this case: capitalism, without the<br>
anarchist element) is going to be detrimental to overall productivity. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyway, the "revolutionary elements" from the '60s and '70s are now &gt;the</i><br>
ones in power, and their ideals have IMO been implemented, democratically.<br>
<p>
They are also the ones driving Mercedes' now and make enough to seriously<br>
start doubting their own beliefs... ;-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If we had had a revolution, and a real communist system for a while, the</i><br>
future might now have looked brighter. People do get dissatisfied under<br>
communism, and then we could overturn it and introduce anarcho-capitalism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I will emigrate to the US ASAP. </i><br>
<p>
Why ? Looks to me you'd be far happier in any ex-communist country. <br>
