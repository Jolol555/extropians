Eric Watt Forste:<br>
<i>&gt;And finally, it's my opinion that the current crop of French</i><br>
<i>&gt;poststructuralists are neither very original nor very interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The best of them are just riffing off of Nietzsche, so you might</i><br>
<i>&gt;as well blame him.</i><br>
<p>
Best remove Foucalt from the title, then.  He isn't current <br>
(deceased), and he spent part of his career trying to get past Nietzche, <br>
which was difficult to accomplish given the politics of his period.<br>
