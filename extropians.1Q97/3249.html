Robin Hanson:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You would clearly be a very unhappy person had you not found friends</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;who share your values as closely as you think your friends do.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;don't begrudge those of us with very ususual values the benefits of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;diversity of associatations gained from a tolerance of different values.</i><br>
<p>
The degree of intimacy a friend can attain with you is very much<br>
dependent upon their similarity to you. People who do not share my<br>
obsession with psychedelics cannot relate to or appreciate what I am<br>
talking about when I am refering to instances where I have consumed<br>
"heroic" doses of an entheogen. A person who doesn't have a comparable<br>
understanding of similar cognitive fields as I do will be wholly<br>
incapable of sustaining a relevant [non-superficial] conversation with<br>
me. Similarity is necessary for a relationship to have any true depth in<br>
a broad spectrum. Its about empathy and depths of understanding. <br>
<p>
However, on the internet, I am not particularly looking for friends. I<br>
make acquaintances who can satisfy specific highly focused interests,<br>
and these people can be extremely diverse. I have no desire to be<br>
cognitively intimate with them on a broad spectrum. It does not matter<br>
if my internet aquaintances particularly share a similar moral,<br>
aesthetic, or political interest/understanding. I generally seek them<br>
for their specific knowledge, ability, or some other specific attribute.<br>
This Elist is an example of a network of acquaintances for me. I<br>
appreciate the people here for their knowledge on science, and for their<br>
ability to rigoruosly debate my own ideas on the same. Unlike my handful<br>
of close friends, I have not been attracted to you for your physical<br>
beauty, your musical skills, your psychedelic obsession, your taste in<br>
literature, food, and movies, etcettera. You might all be overweight,<br>
scarred, tone deaf, and scared witless of psychedelics, but that hardly<br>
matters. Its alright if our relationship is fairly superficial,<br>
detached, non-sensual, non-emotional, but where my friends are<br>
concerned, that is not tolerable. <br>
<p>
My friends and I must be similar, if not, if we grow in entirely<br>
different directions [or if my friends refuse to grow], then we become<br>
acquaintances, and we move on to find new friends. And that is fine. <br>

<p>
How could your friends differ widely in lifestyle from you. If you are<br>
not doing the same things, appreciating similar things, then what are<br>
you doing together? Lets say you cannot tolerating watching television,<br>
but this is your "friends" favorite past time. Do you just hang out and<br>
suffer the television with that person for the sake of diversity or do<br>
you go out and find real friends who want to explore and play in similar<br>
ways as you do? <br>
<p>
I must have more in common with a friend than an interest in tomorrows<br>
weather. Diversity is great socially, it gives us options, choices,<br>
alternatives, but a friendship based on diversity is doomed to surface<br>
superficialty. There's a reason why we have cultures, and subcultures,<br>
and subcultures of subcultures. We want friends who can relate to our<br>
experiences.  <br>
<p>
A person who refuses to have similar friends is a person afraid of an<br>
intimate relationship. Whereas a person who is afraid to make<br>
acquaintances outside their own sphere is afraid to have their ideals<br>
challenged and augmented. Friends and acquaintances serve different<br>
purposes. I have a hell of a lot more acquaintances than I have true<br>
friends, and I believe that will be true of any strongly individualistic<br>
person. I have no desire to be friends with anyone and everyone. No<br>
egalaterian here.<br>

Cheers,<br>
