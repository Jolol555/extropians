[Saith Lee Daniel Crocker:]<br>
<i>&gt; But I don't think it applies here.  Two facts get in the way: first,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in order for two automatic translators to communicate effectively,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they will need to share /some/ common protocol for representing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts they plan to exchange.  The more universal this internal</i><br>
<i>&gt; protocol is, the more useful the machines will be, so there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; drive for stability.</i><br>
Why should the universal internal protocol be *English*?  The simple act<br>
of translation would seem to require some sort of semantic encoding.  If<br>
the semantic encoding is common - and this, note, is not a language at<br>
all - then all an individual language needs is translation to and from<br>
the semantic content.  In other words, translating from English to<br>
thought to Chinese to thought to Vietnamese is a wasted step; just<br>
translate from English to thought to Vietnamese...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Second, since much of the information content</i><br>
<i>&gt; of something like a movie or television show is not expressed in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the mere language used, such recordings will have to be archived in</i><br>
<i>&gt; their original, complete form, so that transhumans who study these</i><br>
<i>&gt; fossils will be able to see the tones, facial inflections, music,</i><br>
<i>&gt; lighting--and cultural idiom--contained in them.  To deliberately</i><br>
<i>&gt; abandon English rather than keeping it alive along with whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; native transhuman communication we develop would be to smash the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rosetta stone, limiting our ability to learn from the past.</i><br>
<p>
Whoa!  We aren't talking transhumans here; transhumans would simply<br>
communicate *thought* directly without need for language.  Telepathy, in<br>
a word.  After all, (your) thought to English to (your friend's)<br>
thought... there's a wasted step here.<br>
<p>
Similarly, of course a television show contains information other than<br>
direct semantic content... the synchronization of that language, rhyming<br>
poetry, and so on.  So you have one transhuman who understands English,<br>
and then you transmit his thought and poetic admiration and whatever to<br>
the French-speaking transhumans.  (Assuming we haven't abandoned<br>
language.  And, as always, assuming enhanced humans but no Singularity.)<br>
<p>
While if we're dealing with fallible mortals, they might perfectly well<br>
choose to abandon the Rosetta stone in favor of automatic translators. <br>
Why go to all the work of maintaining a language not suited to your<br>
personality, simply so that you can read Shakespeare in the original,<br>
when a mechanical translator can effortlessly make it all so clear?<br>
