<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; [SNIP]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Though it is difficult to see out of context, the quote above was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rhetorical question, but I appreciate your response none the less.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's OK, it was a rhetorical reply ;-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; However, since we can't step outside ourselves to check words against</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; reality, when we call something true that means we *conjecture* it to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;So we are saying one thing, but we means something *slightly* different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is one of my difficulties with the term truth, by definition it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;does not include this element of conjecture or skepticism. By definition</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it is absolute, and not particularly questionable. Do you not imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that we might come up with a better term for what we are talking about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;One which is a bit more accurate or *true* [to use the term loosely].</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The dictionary definition of truth is not entirely consistent with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;manner in which it is being used by science. Would it not make more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sense to create a more accurate word ... and then while doing so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;questioning all the priorities which truth and the new word both entail.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the confusion lies in thinking that the definition of truth</i><br>
<i>&gt; gives us some understanding of how to test for truth.  As I said above,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it does nothing of the kind.  We test for truth by more or less</i><br>
<i>&gt; pragmatic or Popperian methods.</i><br>
<p>
We use pragmatic methods because we are not really testing for truth but<br>
rather for *practical* functionality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The definition of truth stipulates an</i><br>
<i>&gt; *ideal* scenario.  It defines what we *want*.  It doesn't help us to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; there.  (That much of the hullaballoo against truth this century is</i><br>
<i>&gt; correct. But to ditch truth as a concept, an ideal, is to throw the baby</i><br>
<i>&gt; out with the bathwater.)</i><br>
<p>
I want to make an atom bomb. What matters is that it functions to<br>
annihilate a large number of people while making there land useless.<br>
While I am making my atom bomb, all that matters is that each part of it<br>
is functional. Each part must do what I intend it to. I can create my<br>
atom bomb without every worrying about the concept of truth. If<br>
something does not function then I must figure out where the cause of<br>
the dysfuntion lies and fix it so that it does function. I can throw the<br>
immaculate child out with the bathwater and still create my bomb and<br>
annhilate a great number of people. It still functions. Something works,<br>
partially works, or it doesn't work. I don't have to invoke any such<br>
concept as truth to deal with these matters.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Conjecture and truth are not in competition: everything that we have</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we *call* truth we *conjecture* to be truth in the ideal sense.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; really don't see what's so difficult or problematic about this.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, I understand the concept quite clearly. I am only saying that the<br>
concept is unnecessary and only serves to create particular bias', which<br>
I have detailed exhaustively, which hinder the evolution of science as a<br>
tool itself.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; [interesting discussion of 'conjecture' and new coinage of 'conjection'</i><br>
<i>&gt; snipped]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I believe these terms or terms created with similar meaning, would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more suitable to PCR.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't: it seems needlessly complicated.</i><br>
<p>
But sometimes we must complexify our theories in order to make them more<br>
useful. We certainly want the fewest terms possible to serve our<br>
purposes, but I believe that some of us are beginning to want more from<br>
science than it is now capable. In order for it to become so, its<br>
underlying concepts must evolve. Can you imagine something beyond<br>
science as we know it today, or do you believe that we have attained the<br>
ultimate tool. I'm fairly certain something lies beyond it. In order to<br>
get there I am going to criticize science as it is today, while<br>
attempting to find alternatives.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; What you are talking about, with your waves example (and such things as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the the traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt; Eskimo's snow example, which was recently and amusingly discussed here)</i><br>
<i>&gt; is, I believe, this: there are many different ways of being interested</i><br>
<i>&gt; in things, and these different ways of being interested in things will</i><br>
<i>&gt; prompt us to ask different questions, with different levels of focus on</i><br>
<i>&gt; reality.  But if I, with my meager knowledge of waves ask "is that an x</i><br>
<i>&gt; wave or a y wave?" that question can be answered truly or falsely; and</i><br>
<i>&gt; if a wave-expert asks "is that an x1, y, alpha, gamma or epsilon wave?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; that question can be answered truly or falsely.</i><br>
<p>
When we say that is an x1, y, or alpha wave, we are refering to an<br>
arbitrary type. Part of the confusion is in believing that our arbitrary<br>
deliniations are real. It would be more appropriate to say that this<br>
wave FUNCTIONS as an x1 wave rather than this wave IS an x1 wave. For it<br>
cannot BE an x1 wave. It can only functionally represent an the ideal of<br>
an x1 wave. Do you see how truth confuses the issue, where functionality<br>
is much more useful and rational? When we say this wave is an x1 wave we<br>
are saying one thing yet meaning something *slightly* different, but if<br>
I say that this wave functions as an x1 wave, then I am being much more<br>
clear about what I mean.     <br>
<p>
Are you familiar with the concepts of the signifier and signified, of<br>
the difference between indexes, icons, and symbols? The concept of truth<br>
confuses the distinction between these things. In the case above it<br>
confuses the signifier symbol of x1 with the signified wave. They are<br>
not the same. <br>
<p>
