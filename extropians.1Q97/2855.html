In a message dated 97-02-24 02:21:44 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt;And how about the brain cells?  Don't they age, with toxic byproducts<br>
<i> &gt;building up, DNA damage, etc.?  I don't have the impression that brain</i><br>
<i> &gt;tissue is particularly immortal.  If not, then even if transplanting</i><br>
<i> &gt;worked it may not help much for extending maximum life span because the</i><br>
<i> &gt;brain will die in a few years anyway.</i><br>
 <br>
 At least we can use these clones as a human chop-shop so that we have spare<br>
 parts available in the event of an organ failure.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Cloning parts of humans, or organs, is one thing, but to grow to maturity a<br>
human being, and then chop it  up - eeeegads, man where's that coming from?<br>
<p>
You going to be able to watch an exact replica of yourself sold into slavery<br>
or parceled out for body parts? Even if it is YOUR slave , or your donor.. it<br>
is still YOU. ( well not YOu, but close...) even the LEAST compassionate of<br>
humans <br>
would balk at that<br>
