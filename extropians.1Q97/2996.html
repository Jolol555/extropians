Max More:<br>
<i>&gt;I will also suggest that the implications of cloning (even humans) is </i><br>
<i>&gt;not particularly dramatic (though it is a sign of accelerated progress) </i><br>
<i>&gt;since genetic engineering and other bio-modifications will be more radical.</i><br>
<p>
And yet your basic person out there will be quite threatened by the <br>
potential of altering that which s/he has always been taught not to <br>
alter, either for religious or cultural reasons.  Not to mention <br>
resentful of the added personal responsibility.   Body-mod will seem very <br>
extremely radical to them.  <br>
<p>
I was out by the White House the other afternoon, saw a <br>
large group of religious fundies protesting, and they were <br>
chanting something about 'no more cyborgs'.  I wanted to ask them <br>
what they were talking about (pacemakers?) but the Secret Service guy <br>
begged me not to start anything, so I didn't.  I wonder if religious <br>
leaders are taking steps to cast body modification into a satanic <br>
mold.  Has anyone heard more on this?<br>
