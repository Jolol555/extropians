Max writes (of Popper)-<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Doing away with verifiability hardly means science can't make progress.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Popper is not Kuhn.</i><br>
<p>
Does Kuhn doubt progress??  After all, Kuhn is just a different kind of<br>
evolutionary epistemologist.  His theory could be read to say that science<br>
is rational (accomplishing a kind of criticism by attrition) *even when*<br>
scientists themselves are not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...Perhaps a better account of scientific progress</i><br>
<i>&gt;needs to be developed on a Popperian basis. (It would be a stimulating</i><br>
<i>&gt;project to combine Churchland's account of scientific progress with</i><br>
<i>&gt;Popper's account of the nature of science.)</i><br>
<p>
Stove seems to say (in Reilly's quote) that Popper is flawed by<br>
taking "observation" as a special category.  I thought Bartley treated<br>
that issue more uniformly, taking "observations" (&amp; observational methods)<br>
as just more ideas to hold-provisionally.  More uniformly "irrational,"<br>
meaning non-justificationist, of course.<br>
