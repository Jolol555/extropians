        That is definately true, but it is not nearly an impasse.  There are<br>
extropian-based programs that are doing a good job of dealing with this.<br>
For starters, the Extropic Art Movement (EAM) is currently gaining a fair<br>
amount of publicity.  Art in general is a good way of conveying complex<br>
ideas in an unobtrusive and unthreatening manner.  The EAM, as the name<br>
implies, is a movement based on art with extropianesque connotations.<br>
When many people see this art, some will form a question into their minds<br>
such as "I wonder what the purpose of *that* is?" or "I wonder what the<br>
artist means?"  Once the question is there, people are generally open to<br>
hear answers...and the idea is passed to friends.<br>
<p>
        As well as this, there are quite a few seminars going on worldwide.<br>
When you read some of Eugene Leitl's FYIs, you'll see that there are many<br>
things happening throughout Europe etc.  Online magazines like Homo<br>
Excelsior and Breakthrough! are getting hundreds per day.  In addition,<br>
newsstand magazines such as Rage, Discovery, Time, Popular Science and Wired<br>
have all at least touched upon some very extropian subjects...and that is<br>
just extropy in general.  Libertarianism is also making a name for itself,<br>
paralleling the more ethical and individual facets of extropy.<br>
<p>
        So generally, a lot is happening, though it may be quite obscure.<br>
More will be done to spread the ideals of extropy, but the steps must always<br>
be precautionary: any badly done publicity could very well result in a<br>
societal blacklisting for the philosophy...and that would be regress.<br>
