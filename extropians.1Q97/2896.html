<i>&gt; The question is what prevents someone from starting a new PPL which</i><br>
<i>&gt; protects you from local crime, and makes the appropriate agreements</i><br>
<i>&gt; with other PPLs, but doesn't contribute to this defense "pool".  </i><br>
<p>
The other protection agencies.  If some agency doesn't pull its own<br>
weight on national defense, the other agencies refuse to sign contracts<br>
of cooperation with it, refuse to arbitrate disputes with it, and it<br>
loses its ability to protect, and therefore its market.  Why belong to<br>
a protection agency that is at war with your neighbors'?  You want to<br>
hire the one that has a history of peaceful resolutions.<br>
<p>
In the end, it all comes down to force.  You, and I, and every other<br>
individual are personally responsible for our own lives and our own<br>
safety.  Nothing magical will ever change that.  The best we can do is<br>
to create systems that minimize the cost of that defense in terms of<br>
money and in terms of lives.  But we can never ignore it, or pretend<br>
that some "system" will make it go away.  Force of arms is necessary<br>
for self-protection.  The question is, do we grant that force to a<br>
single monopoly organization, or do we decentralize control of it, and<br>
foster competition? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Predation is a more expensive strategy than cooperation.  It makes more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sense for agencies to contract with each other for arbitration than to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;risk going to war.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I describe a concrete scenario, and you respond with a slogan.   Sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; predation is expensive, but the threat of predation can be cheap.  </i><br>
<p>
I repeat: Predation is a more expensive strategy than cooperation.  This<br>
is a direct assertion of meaningful content, and I continue to believe<br>
that it is true, and that is has real concrete consequences.  If the<br>
fact that it "sounds like a slogan" in your ears (whatever that means)<br>
makes you disbelieve it, that's not my problem.<br>
<p>
Your concrete scenario is this: why couldn't a protection agency try to<br>
manipulate the others into providing their services to it at no cost?<br>
I repeat my answer: because theft has costs that trade does not.  It has<br>
a direct cost in lack of ability to trade with others because of lack of<br>
trust.  It has a direct cost in the willingness of others to use force<br>
against you.   In short-run, low-risk situations like robbing a strange<br>
house while the owner is away, it may be profitable; you'll never see<br>
the owner again, you might not get caught, and you might successfully<br>
fence the goods.  But in a public protection agency?  There's no way a<br>
public entity can get away with dishonest trade for long without an<br>
unaccountable monopoly government backing it up.<br>
