<p>
I think you mean "new true ideas" here as opposed to "new false ideas."  I<br>
think you are getting at this when you then say:<br>
<p>
&lt;If you can assign an absolute (non-probabilistic) positive value to<br>
anything, without deluding yourself or being motivated by externally<br>
imposed goals, that is the Meaning of Life.&gt;<br>
<p>
Avoiding delusion is avoiding "new false ideas."  You do not need to rule<br>
out being motivated by externally imposed goals in order to have meaning,<br>
as long as you exercise free will in choosing to be so motivated.  For<br>
example, if we have a homeostatic genetic regulatory system designed to<br>
promote our survival until we reproduce, we do not *have* to be motivated<br>
by this externally imposed goal.  We can always off ourselves by free will.<br>
<p>
Seeking "new true ideas" sounds like the perennial favorite, the desire for<br>
knowledge of self, others and the environment.  The next question is,<br>
knowledge to do what and why?  If "new true ideas" or knowledge is the<br>
object you are purposefully seeking, what is the source of the object and<br>
why not seek it?<br>
