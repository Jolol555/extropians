<p>
Having worked for both large and small companies I'd say precisely the<br>
opposite. The larger the company the slower the response, the less work<br>
was done and the greater the number of unneccesary managers. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But these $150 dollars an hour is for actual</i><br>

<i>&gt; Rooms, transportation, equipment,</i><br>
<p>
A small company probably doesn't need saleswork because they don't have a<br>
massive production line to keep operational; in most of the small<br>
companies I worked for the majority of the work was repeat business from<br>
old customers and we usually had more work than we could deal with. <br>
Administration is easier because there's no massive management bureaucracy<br>
to get in the way, the company probably works out of cheap offices to<br>
reduce rent and only buys equipment when it has to. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any technology that will make it easier for a one man corp to do sale and</i><br>
<i>&gt; administration will also make it easier for larger corporation. </i><br>
<p>
Like sacking all the managers? I've found they're almost always the last <br>
people to go when a large company is in trouble. After all, they decide <br>
who gets sacked.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also price isn't the the most important factor when it comes to selecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; who you hire.</i><br>
<p>
True. But small companies also respond much faster. In one of my jobs the<br>
company grew from small to large in the time I worked there. When we were<br>
small a customer would report a bug in the software and I'd often fix it<br>
and mail out a new version the same working day. By the time I left we had<br>
to submit any new software version for extensive testing, which took days<br>
to weeks. Sure, we occasionally introduced new bugs but customers were<br>
happier to get a version with a new bug that was fixed the next day than<br>
to wait a week for us to test it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would you put your company's future in the hand of a one man corp where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; owner can loose his ability to work form day to day?</i><br>
<p>
The same could happen with a large company that only puts one person to<br>
work on your project. For another person to take over a complicated<br>
software project could take days. <br>
