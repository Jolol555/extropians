As the entire universe so far seems to be arbitrary, I don't have much<br>

And this applies to survival.  If I stop valuing my survival, that goal<br>
may not come up again.  In which case, I won't be around much longer<br>
either.  Of course, one could have other goals, which justify valuing<br>
survival because otherwise those won't get accomplished.<br>
<p>
But yes, I can easily see us as machines set to fulfill some purpose.<br>
We hold those values because that is what we are; our values are part of<br>
our definition.  We're evolutionarily supposed to value our<br>
reproduction; in fact, we're so complex that a fraction of us have<br>
wandered off and developed new goals, like suriving no matter what, or<br>
having fun, or exploring lots of place, or trying to learn all<br>
knowledge, or realize some concept of a Singularity.  Take away those<br>
goals, and you have a different machine, or a broken one which falls<br>
apart[1].<br>
<p>
I'm not sure what "meaningful" means for this conversation.  Is wanting<br>
to be a polymath meaningful?  It's what I am.  I could try to justify it<br>
practically -- "knowledge is power, this is good for survival" -- but<br>
that begs the question of survival, and isn't really accurate.  I like<br>
to learn for its own sake.  I think I also value my survival, out of<br>
stubboness.  So I have at least two independent goals, which happen to<br>
support each other somewhat.  I can't a priori justify either.  It's not<br>
that I haven't thought about it; I have, a fair bit.  I haven't gotten<br>
anywhere, and neither has anyone else.  This doesn't bother me.  Those<br>
it does bother can die of apathy, and leave the rest of us here.<br>

Why not?  Actually, your definition of circular systems seems off.  Circular<br>
systems are like Escher's waterfall and staircase, where one thing leads<br>
to another over and over.  I think what we're talking about here _is_<br>
Euclid arbitrariness.  Certain values are imposed by evolution and<br>
upbringing.  They aren't justified by their conclusions; they're just<br>
there.  Not circular.<br>
<p>

 <br>
If that's what you want, you'll have to work for it.  I don't think the<br>
postulate is wrong.  Actually, I'm not sure it's terribly well defined<br>
to be either right or wrong.<br>
<p>
} How do I reason to it without accepting it as given?<br>
<p>
I dunno.  I take some things as given.  Can you give any systems, of any<br>
complexity, that don't either rely on something else or that aren't<br>
'given'?  Something which is self-contained and self-justifying?  You<br>
believe the entire universe must be such a thing, but so far that's just<br>
been your affirmation.<br>
