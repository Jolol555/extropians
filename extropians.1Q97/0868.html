I don't want to be appearing to nag, being a newbie on a voluntarily<br>
maintained list (BIG thanks go to the sorely tried list/site admin) of<br>
seasoned extropians. However, I am really looking forward to the planned<br>
reformed structure of the mailing list, as Max More has hinted at some<br>
time ago. Cart, horse, and all.<br>
<p>
Some symptoms of the dread disease: a noticeable fraction of technically<br>
minded people have unsubscribed from the list (no name naming needed,<br>
nay, but I do miss them), their informal reasons being mostly too low<br>
signal/noise ratio. A kmail a day keeps the disk doctor away. Maybe, but<br>
my eyeballs are sore, my delete finger has a case of RSI from hitting<br>
rubout and my telecom fees (use an offline mailer, stupid! or consider<br>
relocating to a less telecomically challenged part of the geoide...) seem<br>
to hint at a novel kind of Singularity, a potentially financially<br>
ruinous one. Ack.<br>
<p>
We need is a number of channels, where each individual can select a set<br>
of them optimally tailored to his gusto -- mine happens to be tech<br>
discussions/planning/coordination of projects -- doubtlessly other<br>
distinguished participants have their own private set of preferences<br>
(META:ART:PHIL:MEMETICS:AQUAPE:WHAFU^H^HTEVER). We already have the<br>
transhuman list I perfidously flood with technical FYIs (congratulations<br>
to the brilliant scheme of bringing strayed transhumanists heim ins<br>
reich, btw, it was _sneaky_) -- admin's consent granted feel free to do<br>
likewise. Thanks muchly. Otherwise, kindly point me towards a<br>
transhumanist-flavoured tech forward/discussion list... does such a<br>
beast exist? Or does the modest wish to strive towards becoming a meek<br>
immortal god render one automatically a wild-eyed-chaplinesque-mimic-<br>
spittle-fly-widely-shunned-lunatic, to be pitied at best, shot on sight<br>
at worst? Unbidden, the image of the archetypal cryonicist caricature<br>
comes to mind...<br>
<p>
Anyway, a list server script suite is sure a resource hog (entiam non<br>
sunt...), (un)subscribing a chore, so a different solution is needed.<br>
Frankly, forced use of keywords (periodically reposted updated keyword<br>
list?) in subject lines and a preference list (list of keyword tokens in<br>
body of message? ALL keyword for the whole hog? ~topic exclusion?) for<br>
each participant is the only thing I can think of readily. Ye perl/python<br>
wizards (those with a lot of free time on your hands) please step forth.<br>
Comments welcome.<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
