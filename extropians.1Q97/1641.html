<i>&gt; Oh please Lee, comparing the present comprehensibility of 400-700+ year</i><br>
<i>&gt; old works of literature to a 100 or less year future's possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; comprehension of present literature (though I would hardly call Rudee</i><br>
<i>&gt; Valee literature) is stacking the deck and not a good comparison. Try</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead Thoreau's _Walden_ in an ordinary high school class 50 years</i><br>
<i>&gt; from now (or even try it right now, you will find blank stares of</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomprehension from 99% of them). Bringing up this point proves you</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong...</i><br>
<p>
The comment to which I replied was something along the lines of "in<br>
100 years, you wouldn't recognize English", and I disagree.  The<br>
factors that lead to the changes from Chaucer to Shakespeare to <br>
modern English just aren't there anymore: today we travel more, we<br>
interact with more people, we all watch the same television shows<br>
and movies.  400 years from now, there will be lots of new vocabulary<br>
for the new technologies and new social forms, but today's English<br>
will be understandable to those children without effort--including<br>
its present sounds, which have changed more over the years than<br>
writing simply because writing has been around longer than sound<br>
recording.  In fact, it is interesting to note that speakers of<br>
different dialects of Chinese today understand each other only with<br>
considerable effort, but they both can read Lao-Tsu with ease.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And these sort of "reforms" will further evolve the language. I do think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the cyber elites that start uploading will evolve english and code</i><br>
<i>&gt; into an ideographic language that will allow for greater efficiency as</i><br>
<i>&gt; people's mental capacities are enhanced by technologies, because we will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to compete will a Chinese superpower in the 21st century with  a</i><br>
<i>&gt; billion people who can already think that way....</i><br>
<p>
But why even bother starting with English?  Why patch a sinking ship<br>
when we could build an airplane?  Leave the old ships in museums and<br>
old artworks, where they belong.  Drastically changing English despite<br>
years of books and recordings instead of starting over is the worst of<br>
both worlds: we lose contact with the past, and cripple our future.<br>
