More problems: when you shoot rocks at Earth, how long will it take them<br>
to get there?  If you rely on Earth's gravity to supply most of the<br>
energy, but are launching from very far away, I'd think it will take a<br>
while, as most of the acceleration happens close to Earth.  More time<br>
for Earth to defend (against big rocks... the bigger it is, the slower<br>
and easier the target) or to launch a crushing counterattack.<br>
<p>
Whereas if Earth wanted to attack first, I've already argued that they<br>
could hit Luna in 8 hours, by putting missiles and their fuel in Earth<br>
orbit first.  Actually I was wrong; using a better mean distance (384400<br>
km) the time is more like 9.7 hours.<br>

No chain was ever forged to bind the wind.<br>
And when I think upon all the scars he left on me,<br>
The cruelest are the ones I bear within.<br>
