Abstract<br>
Between the proposals for particle beam and pellet stream spacecraft <br>
propulsion lies an immense, largely unexplored regime. Pushing a <br>
spacecraft using a collimated beam of mesoscopic particles, very <br>
roughly on the order o<br>
f a nanogram mass each (plus or minus several orders of magnitude), <br>
presents new opportunities for high speed interplanetary manned <br>
transportation. This kind of beam can be tailored in velocity, mass <br>
flow, and beam profil<br>
e parameters to fit the mission requirements. The first example of a <br>
mesoparticle accelerator the author is aware of is his <br>
"Starseed/Launcher" accelerator. By ganging many thousands of these <br>
devices together, several gra<br>
ms per second can be fired in a nearly continuous, collimated matter <br>
beam, at speeds from a few meters per second, to a few percent of <br>
lightspeed. The receiver onboard the spacecraft may be as simple as a <br>
pusher plate. Tw<br>
o novel mesoparticle accelerator designs are presented.<br>

1.  Introduction<br>
   Between the the mighty powerplants of the laser sailors and the <br>
gigantic accelerators for pellet stream propulsion lies an immense, <br>
largely unexplored, spaceflight regime. By using very many dust or <br>
smoke sized particl<br>
es a high speed accelerator can be built that is quite a reasonable <br>
size, with a moderately proportioned electric powerplant. The problem <br>
of being able to maintain the collimation of this kind of force beam <br>
over large dist<br>
ances is a difficult one, but probably solvable, especially if <br>
molecular nanotechnolgy is brought to bear. For high accelerations over <br>
short distances, picoradian beam collimation may not even be desirable.<br>
