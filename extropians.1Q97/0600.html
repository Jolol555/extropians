In a message dated 97-01-13 17:22:15 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Genius n. (pl. geniuses or genii)<br>
 <br>
 1 (pl. geniuses)<br>
 a. an exceptional intellectual or creative power or other natural<br>
 ability or tendency.<br>
 b. a person having this.<br>
 <br>
 2 the tutelary spirit of a person, place, institution etc.<br>
 <br>
 3 a person or spirit regarded as powerfully influencing a person for<br>
 good or evil.<br>
 <br>
 4 the prevalent feeling or associations etc. of a nation, age, etc.<br>
 <br>
 This is not a "my dictionary is better than yours" post, just an<br>
 observation that what order definitions appear in is largely irrelevant.<br>
 What is important is what is intended by the usage of a word and I think<br>
 it was quite clear from the original post what the author was trying to<br>
 say.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I apolgize for any miscommunication, I was not implying that the dictionary<br>
NUMBERS had any relevence... in fact I left them out for that reason..<br>
The order in which they appear in my dictionary surprised me, in fact. <br>
I had never heard of the Roman spirit guardian definition.<br>
<p>
What I meant to show was that the word implies Arts, Sciences ( the very same<br>
areas the Greeks applied for Muses) and the innate meaning is "one who has an<br>
affinity for" something since birth. Now since I dont believe in spirits, but<br>
I do believe in evolution and human persereverence, i think it is intersting<br>
to look into that concept of Genuis, but not from a feminist *or* mysogenist<br>
view.<br>
<p>
As Extropian, to exemplify ourselves, to become smarter- is our goal, is it<br>
not? Ovecomeing limits, regardless of sex, genetic prevalences ( I am<br>
predisposed towards perfect rendering, it comes "naturally" - but I also want<br>
to master the sciences and math) .<br>
So again, I must have really botched up my attempt at opening up this thread<br>
on GENIUS.<br>
<p>
<p>
But it is an interesting thing that the word GENIUS, has origins based on<br>
genere, which means produce.. and a "tutorial spirit" given at birth.<br>
<p>
In other words, altough the dictionary has "spirit" as an early defintion I<br>
did not mean to imply I believe in the concept. <br>
I am an avid rationalist, and believe th old saw about inspiration and<br>
persperation.<br>
