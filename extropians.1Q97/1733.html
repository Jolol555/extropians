It is truly possible. I've done it myself at a freinds workshop in<br>
Seattle. The reason why it is not done is because it is impossible to<br>
keep ANYONE from tapping into your power if they build the reciever, so<br>
you don't know who is taking your power, so you can't bill them for the<br>
service. (It is illegal, for example to steal power from the big power<br>
lines with a similar sort of induction circuit, one guy got caught with<br>
a 30,000 foot length of copper cable wrapped around his garage, near a<br>
power line, from which he was taking power via the coil that was not<br>
attached to the line in anyway except by induction.)<br>
<p>
In order to make this feasible, the whole worlds power companies would<br>
need to merge into one huge cooperative monopoly. People would have to<br>
buy power recievers that are metered, or they would have to pay a head<br>
tax based on the average power consumption for their area. This sort of<br>
scheme was experimented with by Tesla at a huge mushroom shaped antennae<br>
he had built with the help of Morgan, next to a power station on Long<br>
Island.<br>
<p>
This is different from the beamed microwave scheme stated previously by<br>
another list member, as microwaves can be narrow cast as coherent beams<br>
of energy, while the lower frequency power Tesla was working on<br>
harmonized with the earth's magnetic field.<br>
