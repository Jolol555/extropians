<i>&gt; What would you call a world where differnt people make different</i><br>
<i>&gt; voluntary arrangements?  In some areas, people agree to respect</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizations which enforce property rights, and in some other areas</i><br>
<i>&gt; people agree to not respect such capital ownership.  Treaties between</i><br>
<i>&gt; the areas determine what happens when a person from one area enters</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other area.  The sort of anarchism I'm interested in is one where</i><br>
<i>&gt; all arrangements are based on voluntary agreements, regardless of</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether those argeements respect capital, corporations, or whatever.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is there a name for this?</i><br>
<p>
Anarcho-capitalism would not prevent this.  If a group of luddites<br>
or modern socialists wanted to buy a large tract of land, and allow<br>
others on it only on condition that they agree to its socialist<br>
contract, outsiders would have no right or reason to interfere, so<br>
long as they didn't take any of our property.  We would be morally<br>
obliged to leave them alone in their squalor while we prospered in<br>
our rational capitalism. :)<br>
