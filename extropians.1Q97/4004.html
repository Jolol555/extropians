Lee Daniel Crocker responded to my response:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; If someone is a reasonable person, then the fact that they have come</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to some opinion is information to you.  It is an important clue. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, that's what I thought I said.  It's a clue; one among many.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But since I'm the one affected most by my decisions, and I'm the one</i><br>
<i>&gt;who has to take responsibility for them, I'm the only one I allow</i><br>
<i>&gt;to make the final decision as to which clues have better proof.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;give a very high weight to my own observations and experiences over</i><br>
<i>&gt;the opinions of others. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you ask how many people whose opinions--in the absence of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;direct experience of mine--I value so highly that I might actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;re-examine my own ideas in light of their disagreement, then yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are very few of those indeed. </i><br>
<p>
I think you are making a serious cognitive error here.  Briefly: the<br>
fact that you make final decisions is irrelevant to the weight you<br>
should give to the opinions of others.  This weight can be objectively<br>
calculated in principle, and is typically large, as Damien S. said.<br>
<p>
Since your post was endorsed by Michael Lorrey, ShawnJ99@aol.com, and<br>
GeoffCobb@aol.com, I'll try to explain in some detail.<br>
<p>
Imagine we have some set of alternative theories of how the world is,<br>
and also have some set of relevant evidence.  Now consider asking:<br>
does this evidence lend support to one of these theories relative to<br>
the others?  If so, how much support?<br>
<p>
There is relatively widespread agreement that the answers to these<br>
questions are not a matter of personal taste.  Roughly: each<br>
theory can be used to generate expectations regarding the sorts of<br>
possible evidence one is likely to observe, and theories which suggest<br>
a higher likelihood for observing the actual evidence are better<br>
supported.  Bayesian decision theory is an exact framework for making<br>
such calculations, but there are many other approaches which roughly<br>
agree in the standard cases.<br>
<p>
Regarding what weight to give to the opinions of others, the key point<br>
is:  opinions are just another kind of evidence.  To decide how much<br>
support any one person's opinion gives to any one theory, you ask:<br>
it this theory were true, how likely would it be for this person to<br>
come to this opinion.  If this likelihood is relatively high, this<br>
opinion supports this theory.  This degree of support is not a matter<br>
of personal taste, nor does it depend on your level of "responsibility".<br>
<p>
Of course people are complicated, so there are a lot of details to<br>
consider in estimating such chances.  You should in principle consider<br>
whether this person just likes to be a contrarian or a conformist,<br>
whether you expect them to make many or few cognitive mistakes in this<br>
area, how much weight they give to other people's opinions, what other<br>
evidence they may have seen, whether they might want to deceive you<br>
and others regarding their opinions, and whether they know of your<br>
opinion.  Of course you may well want to use heuristic approximations<br>
here in place of detailed exact calculations.<br>
<p>
There are lots of explicit models of situations like these, most but<br>
not all using Bayesian inference, and the robust result is that other<br>
people's opinions should be given a lot of weight, typically much more<br>
than the weight given to your personal experience.  In fact, it turns<br>
out to be difficult to explain persistent divergence in opinions. <br>
<p>
For example: should your first vehicle purchase be a car, pickup, or<br>
motorcycle?  Well you might rent/borrow one of each for a week to try<br>
out, but even then there's a lot you wouldn't know about how<br>
comfortable they'd feel after a year of driving, how much trouble they<br>
are to keep up, how dangerous they are, etc.  You are well advised to<br>
take the vehicle choices of more experienced people around you as a<br>
strong clue regarding these uncertainties.<br>
<p>
Or consider the winner's curse in common value auctions (such as for<br>
oil tracts or art for resale).  You're a fool not to consider the fact<br>
that winning the auction tells you that everyone else made a lower bid<br>
than you, and likely has a lower estimate of the item's value.<br>
<p>
Similarly, while you might abstractly reason that "paternalism",<br>
forcing people to do things good for them, vs. just advising them, is<br>
a bad idea, the experience of billions of parents, teachers,<br>
employers, and local governments of thousands of years contains much<br>
relevant information.  Why do they continue in this practice if it is<br>
worse than an obvious and widely tried alternative?  ("For their own<br>
benefit, not for those they `help'", is not a good answer.  I have a<br>
paper on a better answer.)<br>
