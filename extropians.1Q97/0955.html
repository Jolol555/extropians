<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;   When I see someone upset by a statement, it is usually</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a simple, straightforward statement of fact or opinion.  A talk</i><br>
<i>&gt;  show host in SF recently said on the air "I believe the ethics of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Jesus to be morally superior to the ethics of Judaism."  Jews</i><br>
<i>&gt;  everywhere were indignant, and demanded apologies or reprimands.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Why?  They had no cause to take offense.  He believed that, he</i><br>
<i>&gt;  stated why he believed it.  I as an atheist took no offense, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  merely disagree.  He behaved entirely appropriately as a talk show</i><br>
<i>&gt;  host by expressi &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IMO this illustrates David's point most eloquently, rather than negating it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I also mayhave "no respect for those who complained" - but that is not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; point. They do not get your respect, so what? They probably are too angry</i><br>
<i>&gt; to care by the time you are to that point. A rational debate is pointless.</i><br>
<p>
The statement above is a plain, honest, unadorned, statement.  How could<br>
it possibly be expressed in any "softer" way without distorting it to<br>
the point of vacuousness or outright lying?  If it had been a deliberately<br>
hateful statement like "What would you expect from those evil heathens" I<br>
would join the complaints, but because his statement is irrational and<br>
dogmatic, not because of any particular emotional attachment I or other<br>
listeners may or may not have.<br>
<p>
Since the original statement is not like that, the fact that the plain<br>
truth of an honestly expressed opinion provoked such a reaction is prima<br>
facie evidence of an intellectual pathology in those listeners.  The fact<br>
that we might have predicted it ahead of time is evidence that we as a<br>
society tolerate, even welcome, this intellectual weakness.  Evading it,<br>
dancing around it, or denying it won't cure the problem.  Dealing with it<br>
honestly and openly will.<br>
<p>
Call me a button-pusher if you will; I hold the title proudly.  Consider<br>
me the QA department for the mind.  There's a bug here: if you push this<br>
button, it malfunctions.  Your response is "well, don't push that button".<br>
Mine is let's /remove/ the button.  Let's fix the bug.  Maybe I've spent<br>
too much time in software QA, but sometimes you have to deliberately<br>
push those buttons and look for failures to get things fixed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To blatantly push these buttons and then act indignant when others react -</i><br>
<p>
I'm not indignant--I'm just pointing out that it's a bug.<br>
