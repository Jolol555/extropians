Seeing this, I felt compelled to respond to Wendy and Phil as follows:<br>
<p>
Having just read your manifesto hoping to ban human cloning, I felt I<br>
must respond, in the name of human rights. What you are proposing to do<br>
is to deny humans everywhere the ability to express in the purest way<br>
that characteristic which is most notable about our species: our ability<br>
to create, to reproduce, even when accidents of nature stand in the way. <br>
I am a libertarian, and as such hold that all that is right and good in<br>
this world derives from respect for the concept that all power is<br>
derived from the individual, that all rights originate from the<br>
individual. To support any law, policy, regulation, or ideal which<br>
opposes the rights of the individual is to denigrate the dignitiy of the<br>
individual human in the most profound way.<br>
<p>
For this reason, rather than acting in fear as you have apparently done,<br>
I ask you to explore the possibility of proposing public policies which<br>
will achieve the apparent goals of your "ban" while at the same time<br>
maximizing individual human rights.<br>
<p>
That every human has the right to freely procreate is recognised in all<br>
civilized societies (which inferrs attendant responsibilities as well).<br>
All civilized societies also recognize common concepts of intellectual<br>
property, notably concepts like the patent, copyright, and trademarks.<br>
Many people around the world have debated for several decades on the<br>
subject of genetic information and intellectual property, especially in<br>
the area of patents.<br>
<p>
Your organization seems to be opposed to the potential for corporate<br>
abuse of cloning technology to enslave humans by the patenting of DNA<br>
sequences. In this I applaud you. How you wish to go about it though,<br>
frankly scares me even more. At least in the marketplace, the public can<br>
vote with its money on the business practices of corporations. In too<br>
many countries, no such competition is allowed in the area of politics<br>
and government. I fear even greater the possibility of government<br>
monopolies of power abusing this technology in secret than I do in<br>
corporations which must compete in the marketplace for public approval.<br>
<p>
Due to this, I propose that your organization pursue a policy that<br>
recognizes that 1) only human individuals can make claims of<br>
intellectual property involving DNA, 2) each individual posesses primary<br>
and majority ownership of his or her genetic intellectual property<br>
present in his or her own DNA, which cannot be assigned, waived, leased<br>
or sold. 2) each individual posesses secondary and guardian ownership of<br>
all other individuals posessing copies, in whole (clone) or in part<br>
(natural fertilization) until those individuals attain adult legal<br>
status, or if the state intervenes in the interest of the derived<br>
individual, as is now done in juvinile court, or by various departments<br>
of education, health and human services, etc. Each derived generation,<br>
in whole or in part is to be regarded in the same manner as "next of<br>
kin" are legally today in natural born families. 3) These intellectual<br>
property rights infer responsibilities of stewardship, which if<br>
neglected or abused shall constitute severe human rights violations<br>
punishable under expansions of current law.<br>
<p>
By becoming proponents of this sort of policy, we establish primary<br>
political ownership of ANY sort of reproduction or creation of ANY sort<br>
of intellectual property in the hands of the individual, who is free to<br>
choose as is his or her right how and when and where to exercise those<br>
rights, without violating those of others. THus no government, nor any<br>
corporation can ever commit such abuse without the expressed approval of<br>
each and every individual involved. We reinforce the concept that<br>
political power flows from the individual, and governments and<br>
corporations weild power only as delegated by free individuals. By tying<br>
these rights together, an assault on one aspect is an assault on the<br>
whole.<br>
