Lee Daniel Crocker responded:<br>
<i>&gt;Both of those seem plausible, but I still think the most fundamental</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps part of what changed was beliefs about "racial inferiority,<br>
economic necessity, right of conquest", but I don't see these at<br>
beliefs about what is moral.  If I believe it is moral to enslave<br>
inferior races, and turn against slavery because I learn this race is<br>
not in fact inferior, my moral beliefs have not changed.<br>
