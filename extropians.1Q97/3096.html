In a message dated 97-03-02 08:48:59 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Discerning persons would.  Why do you care about the opinions of <br>
<i> &gt; those who can't see beyond externalities--they're not worth wasting a </i><br>
<i> &gt; short life on.  Think of it as a screening device to find the truly </i><br>
<i> &gt; interesting people.</i><br>
 <br>
 But eliminating them leaves a relatively small part of the population to<br>
 choose my friends from. I might well do better to spend some time giving<br>
 clues to the clueless... <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
Tell me about it! But I find that the best way to argue for Extropic memes,<br>
is my Automorph :  to live a great example of Extropy... rather than debate<br>
things, people have these set ideas, they spew the deathist mentality and<br>
stick to it firmly. ...<br>
and often I just listen to them, sort of gently push the buttons of optimism,<br>
Extropic Art, Individual Freedom, and so on.. and if they are interested<br>
*then* I will talk.. but otherwise I just like to let them watch and see the<br>
results. Cluelessness is usually a self imposed condition, and one that<br>
people do not give up lightly( like religions).<br>
