It has been a long time since I read a book which had as much meat to it <br>
as Minsky's Society of Mind.  Calvin's latest, which I have been reading <br>
on the web--even though I ordered a paper copy, is of that class.<br>
<p>
Calvin has gotten down there among the active elements, and while he may <br>
have some or even many details wrong, his work on this subject is deeper <br>
than anyone else's I know about.  He has done nothing less than provide <br>
a cogent theory of how thinking comes about.  I suspect that his work <br>
could be directly translated into hardware and a mind would emerge.<br>
<p>
If you have not read this, do so.  If the concepts are too deep, try some <br>
of his earlier works first.<br>
<p>
This is *major* extropian source material folks.  It is the kind of work <br>
which could lead quickly to strong AI.<br>
