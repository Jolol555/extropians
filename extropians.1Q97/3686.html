IAN: You raise some good points. I've not reviewed the radar tapes,<br>
in fact, the first time saw them was on the Paris-Match web site.<br>
That's why the  FBI did not raid my property to seize the tapes<br>
that "show nothing." "Nothing, do you hear me NOTHING, NOTHING...."<br>
<p>
I believe that the seized tape was a genuine copy. It seems that<br>
the Match has two other images with hits of the object that they <br>
did not print.  I don't know why; but it stands to reason that <br>
minus these images we cannot get a good picture. <br>
<p>
In an inquiry into the validity of the tapes, apart from the cite <br>
I posted yesterday where the official investigators are cited as <br>
having conceded the tape is real but that it only shows a passing <br>
"aircraft," it is also important to consider that what Russell's <br>
tape shows is exactly what was described by the Associated Press, <br>
just two days after the accident, as being shown on the original <br>
FAA radar tape. As the AP [*] reports:<br>
<p>
       Radar detected a blip merging with the <br>
       jet shortly before the explosion, some-<br>
       thing that could indicate a missile hit. <br>
<p>
The process of the blip "merging" with TWA 800 shown in the <br>
official radar data inherently implies the process of motion, <br>
which dictates that the blip was hit on several radar sweeps,<br>
exactly as Richard Russell's radar tape showed.  The evidence<br>
strongly indicates that Russell's tape was the genuine goods,<br>
which further explains why the FBI was so quick to seize it.<br>
