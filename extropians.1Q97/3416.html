Yes!  Peter, you are absolutely correct. It's not that I didn't put his name<br>
down because I thought it wasn't important, I was making leaps. Actually,<br>
the perspective you are looking at, leaving gravity, is far more forward<br>
thinking than emphasizing dropping to gravity. <br>
<p>
I'm sure the leaders of the<br>

<p>
The question is, should I?  From what I understand (i.e., Eric Watt Forste's<br>
posts), that the Planetary Society is part of the JPL mind set of only<br>
robotics to space, not transhumans. On the other hand they were supportive<br>
of SETI. So, clue me in.  Is the World Space Society far more advanced than<br>
the Planetary Society? I've tried expanding perspectives in the wrong venue<br>
before, and can be a lot of effort for little or no gain.<br>
