<i>&gt; That's a good way to recast the argument: let's assume that the (C) is</i><br>

<i>&gt; Is it in the best interest of authors in general to put the mark on their</i><br>
<i>&gt; books?  This is a much harder question, and if the answer is "yes", then</i><br>
<i>&gt; much of my argument against IP weakens, because I will then have to draw</i><br>
<i>&gt; in enforcement costs and moral arguments and such.  I still believe that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the answer is "no", but it forces me to clarify the benefit more.  A work</i><br>
<i>&gt; to which the (C) is attached will probably increase the /relative, short-</i><br>
<i>&gt; term/ wealth of the author.  That is, he will likely be wealthier as</i><br>
<i>&gt; compared to his neighbor in the year of his book's publication than he</i><br>
<i>&gt; might have been without the (C).  But the /absolute, long-term/ wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the author I believe would still benefit more from leaving the (C) off.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is because the ability of everyone else in the economy to exploit</i><br>
<i>&gt; the work without restraint in ways he might not even have thought of, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; ways he might not understand or approve of and so would fail to license,</i><br>
<i>&gt; would improve the whole economy the  well beyond what relative gain he might</i><br>
<i>&gt; have enjoyed from protection, by lowering the price and raising the</i><br>
<i>&gt; quality of everything he buys, and speeding the discovery of new things.</i><br>
<p>
Although I haven't participated, I have enjoyed the IP discussion.<br>
<p>
Lee's argument for leaving the (C) off could work in some cases, but<br>
probably not in many others.  It has to be the case that the extra<br>
distribution which the works would receive by being unrestricted would<br>
have considerable benefit.  This benefit has to be great enough that,<br>
even though it is probably spread out through the whole society, that<br>
portion which applies to the original author of the works will be greater<br>
than what he would have received had he controlled the distribution.<br>
<p>
An example of this might be some of the Gnu software.  Perhaps the<br>
authors of the Gnu C compiler receive more direct benefit from the existence<br>
of programs built using that compiler than they would have received had<br>
they charged for it.<br>
<p>
(Even in this case, I am doubtful.  Professional programmers make $50K<br>
and up, and there are many, many man-years of work in that software.<br>
The software available only because gcc is free would have to be worth<br>
perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars to each of the main creators<br>
of gcc.)<br>
<p>
But this is an extreme case, a very widely used utility.  Most IP is<br>
simply not that useful.  Works of fiction and art are not going to feed<br>
back much tangible benefit to their creators.  Even most patents aren't<br>
going to change the world to the extent that the creator will have a<br>
noticeably easier life once everyone can use his patent for free.  For<br>
them, it would seem that the best course is to restrict distribution<br>
so that they can charge more for their works.<br>
