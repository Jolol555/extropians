Do you want reasons for a rational person to be confident when excited,<br>
or evolutionary reasons why people would act that way?  If you seem<br>
confident your opponent may decide you know what you're talking about<br>
and back down, to avoid explicitly losing and showing their ignorance.[1]<br>
The more important something is the more you want to feel confident to<br>
win.  The more important something is, the more excited and worried you<br>
will be about winning it.  <br>
<p>
So when arguing over the rights of gov't we get excited because the<br>
issue affects our lives so greatly, and confident to make the other<br>
person back down.<br>
<p>
Cars and planes aren't so pervasive as gov't.<br>

Maybe you'll like this one better: the existence of expertise in social<br>
issues is harder to see.  Or: people are so ignorant about these issues<br>
they don't know how ignorant they are, and don't perceive any obvious<br>
effects of alleged expertise in these areas (an auto mechanic obviously<br>
fixes your car, but what unambiguous results have economists publicly<br>
produced?)<br>
<p>
As for the specific field of amateur libertarian philosophers, perhaps intro<br>
economics courses present free market theory as a simple and tidy<br>
whole, with some mention of complications (axioms, monopolistic<br>
competition) but too weak emphasis.  So people come away feeling they<br>
know The Answers.  At the moment I'm learning more about law and<br>
economics and becoming less confident.  I only learned of the Coase<br>
theorem a few days ago (and have seen it mentioned twice since, ack) and<br>
blight me if I know what the full implications of it are.<br>
<p>
What's fun is trying to argue the possibility of anarchy with opponents<br>
who don't know anything more than intro econ themselves, and thing that<br>
is what I'm arguing from.  Actually those arguments really depend on<br>
intuition -- theirs says anarchy is a silly idea, which is a natural<br>
feeling to have from existing in society; mine is influenced by the<br>
iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, natural selection, simulated annealing,<br>
neural networks, anthills, and market theory, after all of which I find<br>
it more possible to believe there might be some stable human anarchy.<br>
They don't have this intuition.  Progress is difficult.<br>
<p>
[1] If economists have to convinced that people don't like losing face,<br>
I quit.  I think that's a basic observation.<br>

Merry part,<br>
