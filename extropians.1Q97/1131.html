A couple of points on throwing things:<br>
<p>
    Some of the stuff about trajectory computation, release timing,<br>
and so on, was possibly well developed long before Lucy and her kin.<br>
They likely stemmed from arboreal predecessors, who had occasion to<br>
leap around in the treetops, in the manner of modern monkeys: Missing<br>
the branch you jump for has low survival value.  A variety of<br>
present-day arboreal animals with much smaller brains than Lucy handle<br>
projectile-hurling over distances of several meters tolerably well --<br>
they themselves being the projectiles.  The common local example is<br>
(*ahem*) squirrels.<br>
<p>
    There is a subtle point on using weaponry to drive off predators<br>
that may not have come up yet.  To defend against a predator does not<br>
require that one kill or injure the predator, or even that one have a<br>
particularly high probability of doing so.  It merely requires that<br>
one make the risk to the predator, of pressing home an attack,<br>
unacceptable.<br>
    Consider an hypothetical predator that takes one large animal-prey<br>
per week, that starts doing so at age six months, and that attains<br>
sexual maturity some time between two and three years of age.  That's<br>
100 prey encounters before the animal gets a chance to pass on its<br>
genes.  Even an encounter with prey whose only immediate effect is to<br>
injure the predator, may result in its subsequent death, either from<br>
starvation because of reduced ability to hunt, or from being preyed<br>
upon.  Thus if the average risk of even moderate injury, per prey<br>
encounter, is as high as one percent, it is more than likely that the<br>
predator will be out of the gene pool before reproducing.  <br>
    Hence, as long as there are alternate prey animals, it doesn't<br>
take a highly lethal defense to deter predators.  We have the<br>
situation, paradoxical at first sight, that even a prey species that<br>
would be very likely to lose in a fight to the death with a predator,<br>
may be able to deter that predator by virtue of the small chance of a<br>
different outcome.  After all, the predators aren't out for fights to<br>
the death as such, all they want is lunch.<br>
