<i>&gt; I think you are making a serious cognitive error here.  Briefly: the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that you make final decisions is irrelevant to the weight you</i><br>
<i>&gt; should give to the opinions of others.  This weight can be objectively</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculated in principle, and is typically large, as Damien S. said.</i><br>
<p>
That is indeed an error, but not a serious one.  Let me correct: I have<br>
the final responsibility for my decisions, so I am obligated to use the<br>
best methods I can to choose a course of action.  Independently of that,<br>
I also happen to give little weight to the opionions of others, which<br>
may or may not be a mistake on my part. <br>
<p>
I will also admit that it is quite possible that the number of<br>
decisions I make using conscious reasoning is numerically overwhelmed<br>
by those I make sub-consciously by simply following whatever memes<br>
happen to floating in the soup.  I do not stop to reason the way I<br>
walk, or the way I open a door, or the way I reach for something on<br>
a shelf.  I suppose if I cared about such things I could study the<br>
orthopedics involved and find effective ways, but I don't.  I just<br>
do it the way I do it.  In that sense, it is possible that I /do/<br>
in fact "listen" to the opinions of others in the way I hold a phone<br>
to my ear, because I subconsciously do it the way I see it done.<br>
But in the subset of decisions I make consciously, I do not.<br>
<p>
That imples some method of determining which decisions call for my<br>
attention and which do not.  I don't think I have any clear view<br>
of that, so that decision seems to be in the automatic set.  I'll<br>
have to think about that.  I can certainly imagine heuristics: how<br>
large an effect will this decision have on my future?  How likely<br>
do I think it is that the majority opinion might be wrong?  It may<br>
be that the questions I have chosen to examine closely in my life are<br>
precisely those for which following the majority has failed me, so<br>
my selective memory tends to devalue majority opinion as a result.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Imagine we have some set of alternative theories of how the world is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and also have some set of relevant evidence.  Now consider asking:</i><br>
<i>&gt; does this evidence lend support to one of these theories relative to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the others?  If so, how much support?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is relatively widespread agreement that the answers to these</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions are not a matter of personal taste.  Roughly: each</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory can be used to generate expectations regarding the sorts of</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible evidence one is likely to observe, and theories which suggest</i><br>
<i>&gt; a higher likelihood for observing the actual evidence are better</i><br>
<i>&gt; supported.  Bayesian decision theory is an exact framework for making</i><br>
<i>&gt; such calculations, but there are many other approaches which roughly</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree in the standard cases.</i><br>
<p>
There are many complications here as well.  What is the likelihood<br>
that /any/ theory of the set is correct?  All of human knowledge<br>
from all of history doesn't amount to a hill of beans compared to<br>
what there is to know.  Also, how likely is it that human perception<br>
is wired to make evaluating a particular piece of evidence difficult<br>
(e.g., our motion-detection circuitry fooling us into believing that<br>
the images we see on the movie screen are actually moving).  And how<br>
likely is it that human psychology will predispose us to believe<br>
things in spite of evidence (a widespread phenomenon which I can't<br>
possibly justify discounting).  You mention others as well, such as<br>
the possibility of deliberate deception.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There are lots of explicit models of situations like these, most but</i><br>
<i>&gt; not all using Bayesian inference, and the robust result is that other</i><br>
<i>&gt; people's opinions should be given a lot of weight, typically much more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the weight given to your personal experience.  In fact, it turns</i><br>
<i>&gt; out to be difficult to explain persistent divergence in opinions. </i><br>
<p>
Doesn't this treat "evidence" as if it were a continuous quantity?<br>
As if it just piles up in front of each theory to give it weight (in<br>
fact, the very phrase "weight of evidence" assumes this).  But history<br>
and experience show us that not all evidence is created equal: one<br>
measurement outweighs 1000 expert opinions.  If your mathematical<br>
model shows that generally taking seriously the opinions of others <br>
tends to reliably steer you toward theories supported by the most<br>
evidence, that is no use if the theory with centuries of history comes<br>
against a single experiment that not everyone has seen yet, but that<br>
inescapably discredits the majority.  Centuries of the practical use<br>
of Newtonian mechanics were no match for a single Michelson-Morley.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For example: should your first vehicle purchase be a car, pickup, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; motorcycle?  Well you might rent/borrow one of each for a week to try</i><br>
<i>&gt; out, but even then there's a lot you wouldn't know about how</i><br>
<i>&gt; comfortable they'd feel after a year of driving, how much trouble they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are to keep up, how dangerous they are, etc.  You are well advised to</i><br>
<i>&gt; take the vehicle choices of more experienced people around you as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; strong clue regarding these uncertainties.</i><br>
<p>
A fair strategy, given the inability to observe directly which is<br>
built into that scenario.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Or consider the winner's curse in common value auctions (such as for</i><br>
<i>&gt; oil tracts or art for resale).  You're a fool not to consider the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that winning the auction tells you that everyone else made a lower bid</i><br>
<i>&gt; than you, and likely has a lower estimate of the item's value.</i><br>
<p>
In the marketplace, opinions /are/ value, because that's what is being<br>
measured.  That says nothing at all about the strength of opinions of<br>
other issues.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Similarly, while you might abstractly reason that "paternalism",</i><br>
<i>&gt; forcing people to do things good for them, vs. just advising them, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a bad idea, the experience of billions of parents, teachers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; employers, and local governments of thousands of years contains much</i><br>
<i>&gt; relevant information.  Why do they continue in this practice if it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; worse than an obvious and widely tried alternative?  ("For their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit, not for those they `help'", is not a good answer.  I have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; paper on a better answer.)</i><br>
<p>
(1) All the alternatives have /not/ been tried.  (2) Existing practice<br>
is a demonstrable failure in many cases.  (3) They may keep practicing<br>
it out of fear, psychological predisposition, insufficient knowledge<br>
of available alternatives, incomplete understanding of the "evidence",<br>
predisposition to favor the status quo and ignore or deny its failures,<br>
and other reasons.  (4) By your reasoning, nothing new and innovative<br>
would ever happen, because that /requires/ imagining that every other<br>
opinion on the planet might be wrong.  Human progress depends on such<br>
precious arrogance.<br>
