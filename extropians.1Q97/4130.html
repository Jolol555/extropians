This cult business might be a tad of evidence for the "how rational are<br>
people" debate between Robin and others.<br>
<p>
No, not the cult, silly.  We can assume probabilistically that _some_<br>
people will be a tad broken and will do weird things.  Robin's problem<br>
is to deal with all the 'normal' people who aren't seeming much saner in<br>
response.<br>

Part of Eugene's article, with a bit of editing on my part:<br>
<p>
} The deaths apparently end the odyssey of the little-known group that <br>
} started as a desert commune in the 1970s and evolved<br>
} into a literate cult whose bodies were found near shelves of books in <br>
} a posh mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. <br>
} <br>
} It is this evolution that troubles cult watchers. <br>
} <br>
} The group used the printing press for both its business, called Higher <br>
} Source, and its magazine, Heaven's Gate, which<br>
} was used to snag new recruits. It used buzzwords designed to catch <br>
} browsers whose interest ranged from UFOs and<br>
} conspiracies to the spiritual and religious. <br>
} <br>
} The Rancho Santa Fe group is not the only cult to publish books and<br>
magazines.<br>
} <br>
} "Cults are using the printing press for a number of different purposes - to <br>
} recruit, to support themselves, and as apologists," says<br>
} John Knapp, executive director of Cult Awareness Network, Burke, N.Y. group that <br>
} follows exploitative psychological techniques that<br>
} appear in books and meetings.<br>
} <br>
} Steve Hassan, a Boston-based cult expert who has counseled former members <br>
} and their families for 20 years, says that<br>
} New Age bookstores is a simmering cauldron of cult activity. <br>
} <br>
} "There are books about different cults, there are magazines put up by <br>
} different cults. Aum Shinrikyo (the Japanese cult<br>
} that attacked the Tokyo subway with poison gas in 1995) r<br>
 <br>
I didn't edit these bits:<br>
<p>
} Arnold Chanon Bloch, a Los Angeles psychotherapist who has worked with <br>
} scores of cult members and their families, says,<br>
} "If the theology is carefully laid out in print, it's going to have an <br>
} appeal to people who are experiencing a spiritual void or<br>
} unresolved psychological pain." <br>
 <br>
} According to information garnered from the group's own leaflets, <br>
} newspaper ads and its Heaven's Gate Web site, the cult<br>
<p>
} On May 27, 1993, the group, calling itself Total Overcomers Anonymous, <br>
} took out a $29,911 three-quarter-page ad on the<br>
} op-ed page of USA TODAY titled, "UFO CULT RESURFACES WITH FINAL OFFER." <br>
 <br>
} "I think people in general are willing and eager to accept what they see <br>
} on the World Wide Web," says Larry Rosen, a<br>
<p>
Gee, how does the National Enquirer possibly sell all those copies?<br>
<p>
} David Greenfield, a West Hartford, Conn. psychologist who works with <br>
} computer addicts, says part of the Internet's power is<br>
} that groups can present bizarre messages in a mainstream way. <br>
 <br>
Books get published too.  Nice, sober, totally insane books.<br>
<p>
} Recruiting followers on the Internet is more efficient because the cults <br>
} "will reach a lot of disenfranchised people with it."<br>
<p>
Cuts both ways, silly.  Know how many web sites about, but not by,<br>
Scientology there are?<br>
<p>
} "I'm not saying that everybody that hangs out on the Net all day long is <br>
} a loser, but I am saying that if you hang out on the<br>
} Internet all day long, you will be a loser." <br>
 <br>
Uh...<br>
<p>
} "It saddens me that people are out there looking for something to fufill <br>
} their lives and instead of finding that fufillment they find<br>
} something that leads to their deaths," says Waldrep. <br>

"I've stood in sunlight on one side of the street watching the rain fill<br>
rushing gutters on the other.  When the forecasters say there's a 30% chance<br>
of rain in Tucson, it generally means that 30% of the city will get rained<br>
on."<br>
