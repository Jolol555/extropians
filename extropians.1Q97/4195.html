<p>
If you read Hermann Oberth's works, you will see that he concedes that<br>
all of the Nazi rocket technologies were cribbed from the publicly<br>
available patents of Dr. Robert Goddard of Massachusetts. He developed<br>
his 35+ patents on all aspects of rocket technology using private funds.<br>
The only public funding he ever got was a one time $5,000 grant from the<br>
Smithsonian Institution, which does not go very far with rocket<br>
technology.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The collectivist aspect of the United States has a much better developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; space program than any private industry initiative.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your future is optimistic, but not based on historical fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
While large capital programs for space exploration up to the present<br>
have typically been only nationally fundable, if you look at the<br>
receding size and scope of national programs since the early 70's, you<br>
can see that the bureaucracy has run up against the one thing it is<br>
inherently incapable of overcoming: the economic obstacles to<br>
commonplace, everyday use of space, which is mostly embodied in what is<br>
known as the mass fraction.<br>
<p>
That NASA has publicly announced its intention to exit from overseeing<br>
launch operations within  the next decade shows that communal operations<br>
that are funded by taxes on a capitalist system are unfeasible.<br>
Lockheeds VentureStar launch vehicle, along with projects by Pioneer<br>
Rocketplane, Kistler Aerospace, Lunar Resources Company, LunaCorp,<br>
SpaceHab, Bill Gates' and Bruce McCaw's Teledesic Corporation, and<br>
Boeing's SeaLaunch project are examples that the future of space travel<br>
beyond nationalistic bravado belongs to free enterprise.<br>
