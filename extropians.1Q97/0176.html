<i>&gt; This proposal sounded logical, yet it brought up a philosophical question for</i><br>
<i>&gt; me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What exactly is "profit" to an upload, (if you mean the kind of transhuman</i><br>
<i>&gt; upload I am thinking)?.</i><br>
<p>
While uploads will trade in nontangibles (and for us mehums, even <br>
unimaginables) they will certainly have a hunger for more, and better <br>
virtual space (they are extropians, you see), which in our physical <br>
world is equivalent to turning nonanimated, drab matter into a substrate <br>
supporting thought/computation (putting the metaphorical name of God into <br>
Golem's clay). <br>
<p>
Energy is ubiquitous, but only in space. Solar orbits knows no clouds nor <br>
day/night, and is a great location for physical experiments. Care to set <br>
up a particle accelerator around LSO? Go ahead, who needs that useless <br>
Mercury, anyway.<br>
<p>
Why do experiments? Because even our paltry physics hints at things <br>
like strange matter and spacetime engineering. With these vistas explored, <br>
constraints of our spacetime/available matter/energy lose their sting. <br>
Limitless growth? Impossible here (apage apage, vade retro, Omega), but <br>
not Elsewhere. So if it's not there, let's build it, using tools of <br>
this_space(). (If impossible, let's exploit given resources optimally <br>
(extropian misers?)).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Why would an upload feel the need to colonize and explore outerspace? Or any</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical space for that matter?  Or am I missing some major facet of this....</i><br>
<p>
Because artifical reality cannot be detached from the material carrier, <br>
at least initially. And matter is a scarce commodity in relation to the <br>
available energy flux, at least in our backyard of spacetime.<br>
