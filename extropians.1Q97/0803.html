I don't believe you, Daniel. I agree that emotion does not necessarily cloud<br>
reason. The old Star Trek style opposition of reason and emotion is a poor<br>
picture of reality. However, emotional responses *can* make it extremely<br>
difficult to think rationally, while under their influence. When "wallowing"<br>
in an emotion, I think for humans it's hard not to let it interfere with<br>
reason. In some situations, the best thing is to realize that your ability<br>
to think clearly and from various perspectives is currently impaired, and to<br>
put off making decisions and judgments if possible. I think this is more<br>
rational than convincing yourself that you can completely set aside<br>
currently raging feelings to think perfectly rationally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Emotions are valuable guides in decision making, and if carefuly examined can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; help us to make subconscious evalutaions and correctly place our values. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This I reject completely.  Reason is man's only reliable guide to action.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Having emotions is a good thing, just like having teeth, but they are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;a means for discovering truth or making choices.</i><br>
<p>
While I agree with some of the other points you make, and sympathize with<br>
your general approach, I think you've missed QueenMUSE's point. She did not<br>
say that emotions are *reliable* guides to action, only that there are<br>
valuable guides. She's right. Emotions involve subsconsious judgments.<br>
*Sometimes* these can tell us things that we have not consciously realized.<br>
Denying this in favor of a view that only fully conscious reasoning provides<br>
useful information flies in the face of evolution and psychology.<br>
<p>
Nathaniel Branden explores these ideas in detail in his books. He started<br>
with the simpler Randian model that you seem to advocate, but developed a<br>
view that grants emotions more of a role, while still strongly advocating<br>
conscious reason as the final arbiter.<br>
