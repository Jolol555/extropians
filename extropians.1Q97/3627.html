<i>&gt;Ahh but can you customize precisely the programming you'd like to recieve</i><br>
<i>&gt;on your television or choose from many unofficial sources of programming?</i><br>
<i>&gt;How about create a user profile like firefly or my-yahoo to use collective</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligence so that the profile learns what you like and fits the</i><br>
<i>&gt;information specifically to your liking and enjoyment. This sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology could inspire quite a number of people. </i><br>
<p>
What push media also creates is an end to serendipity. We won't be able just<br>
to happen upon something. Furthermore, just learning for the sake of<br>
learning cannot exist in a push based system. I think you're confusing<br>
intelligent agents, which are a tool, with push media, which is a medium.<br>
It's like saying that your remote control is the same as tv programming. TV<br>
is the medium, your remote is the tool.<br>
