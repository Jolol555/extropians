<p>
I do keep seeing that "general dislike of things physical" one<br>
popping up over and over again, and I don't understand it at all.<br>
Some people seem to somehow think that it is possible to have a<br>
computational process without an identical corresponding physical<br>
process. Uploading is not about leaving the body, it's about swapping<br>
an old body for a new *physical* body, or about gradually transforming<br>
one's body into a different *physical* body. It's distressing to<br>
see silly dualistic metaphors pervading so much talk of uploading.<br>
<p>
I am quite fond of my body. I find it wanting, primarily, in only<br>
two areas: the planned obsolescence (accumulated delayed-action<br>
death genes... our evolutionary conditions did nothing to weed out<br>
fatal mutations that don't express until after 30 or so) and<br>
inability to function under the conditions that obtain in most of<br>
the physical universe. But I can't even form a coherent notion of<br>
what it would be like to exist without a body. I just want a body<br>
that isn't engaged in low-level self-destruction and that is more<br>
comfortable to wear while traveling off-planet. Utility fog might <br>
work nicely, if it can be built.  ;)<br>
