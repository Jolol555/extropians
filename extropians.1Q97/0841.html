<p>
There is nothing fast about bipedalism. Humans have good endurance, because <br>
they have no hair and are good at getting rid of waste heat, but as for speed, <br>
with the possible exception of the ground sloth humans are the slowest mammal <br>
on earth.             <br>

                   <br>
<p>
Lots of animals can stand on their hind legs, you don't need to develop <br>
bipedalism for that.<br>

Scavenging was probably much more important than hunting at this stage.<br>

<i>                &gt;the earlier you get a warning of predators. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
If you can see a predator better by standing up high, it also means that the <br>
predator can see you better too, and because you're bipedal, the predator is <br>
a lot faster than you are. If you can't run away from danger a better  <br>
strategy would be to hide and keep low.<br>

<i>                &gt;high stance with a hip structure that also is conducive to                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;bipedalism over quadupedalism. This is a fine example of       </i><br>
<i>                &gt;technology effecting evolution. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
But there were no spears, or tools of any sort at that time, ancestors like  <br>
Lucy (Australopithecus Afarensis) with their tiny, chimp sized brains were  <br>
too dumb to make them. The first very primitive tools were made by  <br>
Homo Erectus, an animal with a much larger brain than Lucy, although much  <br>
smaller than modern brains. These very early tools do not show up in the <br>
fossil record until well over a million years after bipedalism was fully  <br>
developed.         <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                &gt;Due to the computational demands of intuitive trajectory                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;calculation, and the  communication demands of hunting in                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;teams or packs, lager brain cases were seen as an                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;evolutionary  advantage. </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
It's hard to believe that a pea brain like Lucy could do something that <br>
sophisticated, throwing something accurately is very difficult, it takes a <br>
lot of brain power. Even modern humans would have a hard time making a living <br>
by throwing baseballs at swiftly moving animals, much less irregular shaped <br>
shaped rocks.<br>
