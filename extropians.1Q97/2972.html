                <br>
<p>
Unlike you I am not a cynic, but I am a skeptic, and I know that in the USA  <br>
those on welfare are more likely to be grossly obese than malnourished. <br>
I am even more skeptical that your mysterious "study" has have the source of  <br>
this phenomena, but for the sake of argument let's assume it's 100% correct. <br>
<p>
Can we conclude from this that it's a terrible situation to have 2 million <br>
hungry children? <br>
Yes! Very definitely.<br>
<p>
Can we conclude from this that government is good?<br>
Obviously not, we have government and 2 million hungry children too.<br>
<p>
Why aren't these hungry children being helped?<br>
Because nobody really wants to help them.<br>
<p>
Will ANYTHING, government, the church, the market, men from Mars, give <br>
charity to these children if nobody wants to help them?<br>
No.               <br>
<p>

          <br>
<p>
I know you're trying to be sarcastic, but I thing that would be a very good <br>
idea, provided that two questionable ideas you imply in your post are true. <br>
1) 2 million children in Briton are near death due to starvation. <br>
2) Nobody will give them charity.<br>
<p>
Child labor is not evil, grinding poverty that makes it necessary is what's <br>
evil.                                                  <br>
