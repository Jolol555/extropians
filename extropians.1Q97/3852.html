In a message dated 97-03-22 10:36:27 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  Most of the people to whom I <br>
 explain transhumanism and extropianism have negative reactions.&gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
According to some 80% of the world is depressed at any one time.  It is the<br>
most common illness mental OR physical.  See Martin Seligman's _Learned<br>
Optimism_ for references to this statistic. <br>
  <br>
 &lt;&lt;But there are antidotes to these negative thoughts.  First, I've learned<br>
to <br>
 read less of the list.  Once a thread wanders into an area in which I'm not <br>
 interested (or if it starts that way), I just delete the messages.  Some <br>
 times I have pangs of guilt, especially if I delete a message by an author <br>
 whose writing I've liked in the past, but keeping up with things takes some <br>
 ruthlessness these days.&gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Exactly.  Delete, Delete, Delete.  With out even reading one word.  I don't<br>
want to brainwash myself into depression, so, it's the most effective<br>
antidote.  Immunization from such negativity also comes from internal<br>
refutation of the negative memes and by realizing that the person is in a<br>
state of depression all be it an intelligent person and even well laid out<br>
argument or "reason" to be pessimistic.  Nevertheless, a good argument for<br>
pessimism does not sway me very much since there are so many ways to refute<br>
it. <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; More importantly, Eugene and Velociman both point to the same problem, but<br>
in <br>
 different ways.  Eugene despairs of actually bringing our goals to fruition <br>
 and Velociman fears we will be stopped by those who oppose us.  Work toward <br>
 one can help avoid the other, but it needs to be done right. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
But "right" does not mean only _one_ way.  There are thousands (millions for<br>
the creative mind) of ways to work towards the future I want.  <br>
  <br>
 &lt;&lt;Post-humanity will happen in a thousand laboratories and businesses.  This<br>
is <br>
 where the real forefront of transhumanism and extropianism lies.  Our <br>
 important work is there.  If you're a researcher or entrepreneur, go to it. <br>
  As the ad campaign says, "Just do it." &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
I would suggest the book _First Things First_ and _The Seven Habits of Highly<br>
Effective People_ both by Stephen Covey. <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; While science thrives on SCIENTIFIC controversy, it withers in the <br>
 face of social and political controversy.  While business enterprise thrives<br>
<p>
 on ECONOMIC competition, it avoids ideological competition.  Most working <br>
 scientists and technologists are rightly afraid of becoming publicly<br>
involved <br>
 in social controversy, for fear of losing funding for their research. <br>
  Businessmen fear explicit or implicit boycott.  Overcoming this problem is <br>
 one of the key challenges facing us. <br>
  <br>
 Dynamically optimistic, &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>

Dynamically Optimistic,<br>
