I got a message from an EXI list member who saw 60 Minutes smear <br>
my TWA 800 web page: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm</a><br>
so I thought I should post this to the list. 60 Minutes focused<br>
largely on a popular conspiracy writer on a segment on Internet <br>
conspiracy theory, but they briefly showed and trashed my page.<br>
<p>
While I've yet to see it, I've had multiple detailed accounts. <br>
Lesley Stahl held up my TWA 800 web page, careful to display my <br>
name prominently, as an example of why the Internet needs policing. <br>
She implied without any reference to fact that my page was an example <br>
of claims made on the internet that are "poorly researched," <br>
"unverifialbe," and "disinformation."<br>
<p>
This is an absolute lie.  Virtually every claim I make is based <br>
on a verifiable media reference cited with the claim. In fact, the <br>
"claims" ARE the media references. The page is PURE research, where <br>
"research" is defined as exhaustive reading and referenced compilation <br>
of the available literature on a given subject to establish a cohesive <br>
picture of what the truth most likely is. Of all the conspiracy oriented<br>
pages that could rightfully be said to make claims that are not verified,<br>
my page is most verifiably NOT a member of that set. Anyone can verify<br>
every citation/claim I present, which is why I give such references.<br>
<p>
It is outrageous that 60 Minutes would label citations from the <br>
major media as "disinformation" only when through them a picture<br>
that 60 Minutes has repeatedly trashed comes through. Clearly, the<br>
60 Minutes coverage of my page was false, misleading, and libelous.<br>
But most outrageous, by not citing the web URL so that people could<br>
verify Ms. Stahl's claims, 60 Minutes made defamatory claims about <br>
my work that are proven by fact to be unverifiable, poorly researched, <br>
and that therefore constitute pure disinformation -- all the features <br>
they sought to dump on me. <br>
<p>
Considering that I'm pointing a finger at the military and that <br>
CBS is owned by a major military contractor...  ahem. Also, it's<br>
all too clear to all who have seen the segment that 60 Minutes<br>
is terrified of the competition that the Internet represents,<br>
and that I was targeted with malice of intent.<br>
