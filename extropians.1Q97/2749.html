<p>
For the same reason we were talking about a few weeks ago; authoritarian<br>
forms of government allow for no opposing views, while libertarian forms<br>
of government allow objectors to set up their own local government of any<br>
kind as long as it's voluntary (or under AC if they have enough power to<br>
coerce people into joining them). So if we set up a Friedman-like society<br>
and it doesn't work we can always try something else.<br>
<p>
I like Friedman's conception of anarcho-capitalist institutions, but I'm<br>
primarily interested in reducing the power of governments to give people<br>
the freedom to run their own lives in any voluntary fashion they choose. <br>
Whether the result is a minimal government such as the US constitution was<br>
intended to provide, a libertarian society or anarcho-capitalism is far<br>
less important. <br>
<p>
This is basically an engineering decision; authoritarian societies give<br>
you many single points of failure which libertarian societies can eliminate. <br>
If one PPL goes bad, that only affects a small group of people and the <br>
majority can act to bring it back under control. If a small government <br>
goes bad then we still have more power than them and can probably defeat <br>
it. If the massive governments we see today go bad then we're all screwed. <br>
<p>
BTW, can someone help me with an anarcho-capitalism question? I don't<br>
entirely understand how PPL/PPAs operate; I can see that for conflicts<br>
between different PPLs the protection agencies have to go to some kind<br>
of independent court for arbitration, but what happens for disputes<br>
purely between customers of one protection agency? I always assumed that<br>
the agency would settle it themselves, but from rereading 'Machinery of<br>
Freedom' over Christmas Friedman seems to imply that they would still<br>
go to an external court.<br>
<p>
Finally, how are PPAs supposed to recognize their customers? Do we all<br>
have to wear big luminous jackets with their logos on or something? I<br>
can see how to do it in a more advanced society (e.g. everyone has<br>
implanted computers and radio-networking), but I'm not sure how we could<br>
do it with current technology.<br>
