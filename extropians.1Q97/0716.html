[Not sure I have the rights toforward this, but it's really interesting...]<br>
<p>
<p>
A step closer to the marriage of nature and technology ...<br>

TOKYO (AP) -- A big brown cockroach crawls across the table in the<br>
laboratory of Japan's most prestigious university. The researcher eyes it<br>
nervously, but he doesn't go for the bug spray. He grabs the remote.<br>
<p>
This is no ordinary under-the-refrigerator-type bug. This roach has been<br>
surgically implanted with a micro-robotic backpack that allows researchers<br>
to control its movements.<br>
<p>
This is Robo-roach.<br>
<p>
``Insects can do many things that people can't,'' said Assistant Professor<br>
Isao Shimoyama, head of the bio-robot research team at Tokyo University.<br>
``The potential applications of this work for mankind could be immense.''<br>
<p>
Within a few years, Shimoyama says, electronically controlled insects<br>
carrying mini-cameras or other sensory devices could be used for a variety<br>
of sensitive missions -- like crawling through earthquake rubble to search<br>
for victims, or slipping under doors on espionage surveillance.<br>
<p>
Farfetched as that might seem, the Japanese government has deemed the<br>
research credible enough to award $5 million to Shimoyama's micro-robotics<br>
team and biologists at Tsukuba University, a leading science center in<br>
central Japan.<br>
<p>
Money from the five-year grant started coming in this month, and young<br>
researchers are lining up for a slot on Shimoyama's team.<br>
<p>
The team breeds its own supply of several hundred cockroaches in plastic<br>
bins. Not just any roach will do. Researchers use only the American<br>
cockroach (Perplaneta americana) because it is bigger and hardier than most<br>
other species.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From that supply, they select roaches to equip with hi-tech ``backpacks''</i><br>
 -- tiny microprocessor and electrode sets.<br>
<p>
Before surgery, researchers gas the roach with carbon dioxide. Wings and<br>
antennae are removed. Where the antennae used to be, researchers fit<br>
pulse-emitting electrodes.<br>
<p>
With a remote, researchers send signals to the backpacks, which stimulate<br>
the electrodes. The pulsing electrodes make the roach to turn left, turn<br>
right, scamper forward or spring backward.<br>
<p>
Over the past three years, researchers have reduced the weight of the<br>
backpacks to one-tenth of an ounce, or about twice the weight of the<br>
roaches themselves.<br>
<p>
``Cockroaches are very strong,'' said Swiss researcher Raphael Holzer, part<br>
of the Tokyo University team. ``They can lift 20 times their own weight.''<br>
<p>
The controls, however, still have a few serious bugs of their own.<br>
<p>
Holzer jolts a roach with an electric pulse to make it move slightly to the<br>
right and keep to an inch-wide path. Instead, the roach races off the edge<br>
of a table into Holzer's outstretched hands.<br>
<p>
``The placement of the electrodes is still very inexact,'' he admits,<br>
setting the bug back on track.<br>
<p>
While a backpack-fitted roach can survive for several months, it becomes<br>
less sensitive to the electronic pulses over time -- a big problem if the<br>
bugs are to be used on longer missions.<br>
<p>
Holzer is optimistic. ``The technology isn't so difficult,'' he said.<br>
``The difficulty is to really understand what is happening in the nervous<br>
system.''<br>
<p>
And technology aside, Robo-roach is still, after all, a roach.<br>
<p>
``They are not very nice insects,'' Holzer confesses. ``They are a little<br>
bit smelly, and there's something about the way they move their antennae.<br>
But they look nicer when you put a little circuit on their backs and remove<br>
their wings.''<br>
