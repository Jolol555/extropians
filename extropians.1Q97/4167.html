<i>&gt; GG, your email address is in the UK, so it is odd that you need reminding</i><br>

<p>
You forget the Ziolkovsky/GIRD/Katjusha/Andrjusha product line, which, <br>
while certainly less spectacular, and distinctly more low-tech than <br>
Vergeltungswaffen (propantrioltrinitrate-gellied nitrocellulose rather than <br>
ethanol/LOX), were great for target saturation, both psycho &amp; <br>
physiological target. First  crude "fire arrow" rocketry has been <br>
invented in China, and used in India against the British occupation, <br>
albeit in minor skirmishes, and to little effect. <br>
 <br>
Interestingly enough, the most efficacious weapons, whether ICBMs, or <br>
bazooka-like fired recoilles antitank/fighter rocketry, are all <br>
intelligently guided actio=reactio rockets nowadays. While skull guns and <br>
cookie cutters is bullshit, g-amounts of lead azide detonating within the <br>
body makes great hydrostatic shockwaves, which trigger all affected neurons <br>
simultaneously, the next thing after the high-velocity cartridgeless <br>
ammo gun. Of course Vernor "Mr. Future" Vinge knew it right from the start.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, the Nazis were capitalists (despite the name 'National Socialists').</i><br>
<i>&gt; They didn't steal technology from capitalist, they *were* capitalists -- and</i><br>
<i>&gt; they developed a lot of it themselves.</i><br>
<p>
They were not. Nazis were a grand-scale planned economy, Schickelgruber &amp; <br>
consorts would have gone broke, if they hadn't started a JIT war. <br>
Assimilation of Swedish iron ore, and Romania's oil fields were <br>
choreographed right from the start. However, Adolf fell prey to Bill's <br>
assumption of being a generalist. While Bill backed out just in time, <br>
Adolf was demented enough to enforce it right to the showdown. According <br>
to Solshenytzin's "V kruge pervom" (dunno whether this is pure fiction, <br>
or actually authentic information), Voshd Narodov Dshugashvili (terminal <br>
syphilis and massive paranoia both kinda make a pattern), planned a <br>
counterstrike. Good things psychotics of any colour, whether "keine <br>
j"udische Physik", or "ich will keinen Kinntop im Kockpit" have been <br>
notoriously wary of technology.<br>
<p>
Let's hope their successors won't notice a pattern, and act constructively.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The collectivist aspect of the United States has a much better developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; space program than any private industry initiative.</i><br>
<p>
Yet. I think soon dramatically falling LEO launch costs (and privately <br>
funded LEO-autoassembling autoreplicator missions to Luna may desert the <br>
barren realm of scifi) will cause a flurry of activity in low earth orbit <br>
missions, which will render NASA uncapable of action, since entirely broke.<br>
