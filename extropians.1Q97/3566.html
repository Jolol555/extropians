K.Aegis writes<br>
: Also, according to three recent books on women inventors, it seems<br>
: that the Countess of Lovelace (1812-1852) is more authoritatively being<br>
: credited with inventing the first binary computer programming language.<br>
: Because she wrote it for a computer invented by her husband Charles<br>
: Babbage, and because of the laws of that time, all of her work would<br>
: have been owned by her husband, and this led to some confusion as to<br>
: the extent of her role.<br>
<p>
I don't think Babbage ever married. Ada married the 8th baron King,<br>
later created Earl of Lovelace.  (No doubt his neighbors were relieved<br>
not to have to call him Lord King anymore.)<br>
