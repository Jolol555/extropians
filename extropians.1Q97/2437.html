Of _The Probability Broach_, I griped, and Michael Hohensee responded:<br>
<p>
: &gt; - All female characters are Heinlein heroines.<br>
:<br>
: If you mean that they're all tough, independent, and good shots.  Sure.<br>
<p>
I don't mind that some women in the cast fit that description.  (I know<br>
a few like that myself. Yum.)  I mind that they *all* do (there are no<br>
bad or neutral women), and that they *talk* like Heinlein.<br>
<p>
(As for good shots - Clarissa says she never misses with a plasma gun,<br>
and in the sequel, plasma guns are said to be notoriously inaccurate.<br>
I've got no sense of humor.)<br>
<p>
: &gt; - The goodguys survive because the badguys never use their guns.<br>
:<br>
: Well, the bad guys don't want to die in a firefight any more than the<br>
: good guys.  There is plenty of shooting in the next few novels, if thats<br>
: what you go in for.<br>
<p>
That's not quite the point.  Everyone has a gun, but when the goodguys<br>
are captured, the badguys don't *shoot* them, but lock them in a freezer<br>
so they can inevitably escape.  (When Blofeld [or was it Goldfinger?]<br>
said "No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die," he was alone in his<br>
expectation. ;) )<br>
<p>
: &gt; - Unable to stop the badguys' evil plan preemptively (because that<br>
: &gt; 	would be coercive), our heroes blow them up accidentally.<br>
: &gt; 	This is described as a triumph of free will.<br>
:<br>
: Sure, the bad guys got it in the end. :)  This leaves the good guys<br>
: triumphant.<br>
<p>
But where is the moral lesson that is supposed to be the whole point?<br>
I prefer the deus-ex-machina to be a bit less obvious, don't you?<br>
<p>
: &gt; - As is Bear's double existence, as if gametes were chosen consciously.<br>
:<br>
: Well, they're parallel universes, guess the Bear family-trees were<br>
: identical.  [...]<br>
<p>
Exactly.  And Bear initially accepted that, with the elaboration that<br>
because he was of Western Indian descent, the ripples of the divergence<br>
that began in Philadelphia hadn't reached his family tree.  But in the<br>
final chapter he says, no, my parents had a son because they chose to!<br>
<p>
: &gt; - Griswold's chilling reputation is presented but never justified.<br>
:<br>
: They aren't at the center of the story, so why should they be focused on?<br>
<p>
If the chronicler can't mention Griswold's without going "brr",<br>
I'd like to know why.  It's admittedly a small thing.<br>
