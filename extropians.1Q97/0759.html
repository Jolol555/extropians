<i>&gt; This is why refined emotion, i.e.: enhanced reason - enhanced emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt; response ( a balance) can be a much better goal than a rational, non emotive</i><br>
<i>&gt; state.</i><br>
<p>
This is a false dichotomy; emotion does not in itself cloud reason, but<br>
the false idea that it does is so pervasive in our culture that we allow<br>
it to.  I have never advocated, and would not advocate, supressing one's<br>
emotional responses.  I enjoy wallowing in lust or grief or anger or joy<br>
as much as anyone, if not more.  But when I do, I don't let that interfere<br>
with my faculty of reason.  Emotions are just another aspect of my reality<br>
like my legs or my hair--and I don't let them make choices for me either.<br>
I just take them for what they are, enjoy them, use them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Emotions are valuable guides in decision making, and if carefuly examined can</i><br>
<i>&gt; help us to make subconscious evalutaions and correctly place our values. </i><br>
<p>
This I reject completely.  Reason is man's only reliable guide to action.<br>
Having emotions is a good thing, just like having teeth, but they are not<br>
a means for discovering truth or making choices.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For example:</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you anger me, it is usually not without reason. Reasonably there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; things which one cannot abide. If I recognize that, I can deal with you and</i><br>
<i>&gt; not let it pass by.... If I say " I have no feelings", I may ignore you or</i><br>
<i>&gt; not address it...IMHO Thick skin only hides a tender heart.</i><br>
<p>
I cannot anger you.  You cannot anger me.  That is not denying anger, it's<br>
just putting the blame where it belongs.  If I say something, and you<br>
become angry, it is the nature of /your/ mind that has created that anger,<br>
not the nature of my words.  Words are just sounds--a different mind, say<br>
a man who speaks a different language, or is just less inclined to anger,<br>
would not have the same reaction as you.  That reaction is /yours/, and is<br>
a fact of reality you have to deal with as it is.  Reacting to my words<br>
instead is an evasion of reality, based on a fallacy of reason, in this<br>
case the classic post hoc ergo propter hoc: I spoke, then you became angry,<br>
therefore my words caused your anger.  Once you realize the simple error<br>
of reason, you can deal with reality--including anger--more rationally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If a balance of thoughtfulness and detachment is sought, then you have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow for them, even if your know you cannot be ruled by tehm</i><br>
<p>
I don't seek "balance" or whatever other new-age mystical nonsense you<br>
would have me seek.  I seek reality.  And I am not ruled by anything<br>
but the laws of physics.<br>
