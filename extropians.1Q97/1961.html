ENGINEERS EXPLAINED<br>
     <br>
 People who work in the fields of science and technology are not like<br>
other people.  This can be frustrating to the nontechnical people who <br>
have to deal with them.  The secret to coping with  technology-oriented <br>
people is to understand their motivations.  This  chapter will teach you <br>
everything you need to know.  I learned their customs and mannerisms by <br>
observing them, much the way Jane Goodall learned about the great apes, <br>
but without the hassle of grooming.<br>
     <br>
Engineering is so trendy these days that everybody wants to be one.<br>
The word "engineer" is greatly overused.  If there's somebody in your <br>
life who you think is trying to pass as an engineer, give them this test <br>
to discern the truth.<br>
     <br>
 ENGINEER IDENTIFICATION TEST<br>
     <br>
 You walk into a room and notice that a picture is hanging crooked. <br>
 You...<br>
     <br>
 A. Straighten it.<br>
 B. Ignore it.<br>
 C. Buy a CAD system and spend the next six months designing a solar-<br>
     powered, self-adjusting picture frame while often stating aloud <br>
     your belief that the inventor of the nail was a total moron.<br>
     <br>
 The correct answer is "C" but partial credit can be given to anybody<br>
who writes "It depends" in the margin of the test or simply blames the <br>
whole stupid thing on "Marketing."<br>
     <br>
 SOCIAL SKILLS<br>
     <br>
 Engineers have different objectives when it comes to social<br>
interaction.<br>
     <br>
 "Normal" people expect to accomplish several unrealistic things from<br>
social interaction:<br>
     <br>
    *Stimulating and thought-provoking conversation <br>
    *Important social contacts<br>
    *A feeling of connectedness with other humans<br>
     <br>
 In contrast to "normal" people, engineers have rational objectives for<br>
social interactions:<br>
     <br>
   *Get it over with as soon as possible.<br>
   *Avoid getting invited to something unpleasant.<br>
   *Demonstrate mental superiority and mastery of all subjects.<br>
     <br>
 FASCINATION WITH GADGETS<br>
     <br>
 To the engineer, all matter in the universe can be placed into one of<br>
two categories:<br>
    (1) things that need to be fixed, and<br>
    (2) things that will need to be fixed after you've had a few minutes<br>
        to play with them.<br>
Engineers like to solve problems.  If there are no problems<br>
handily available, they will create their own problems.  Normal people <br>
don't understand this concept; they believe that if it ain't broke, <br>
don't fix it. Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have <br>
enough features yet.<br>
     <br>
 No engineer looks at a television remote control without wondering what<br>
it would take to turn it into a stun gun.  No engineer can take a shower <br>
without wondering if some sort of Teflon coating would make showering <br>
unnecessary. To the engineer, the world is a toy box full of <br>
sub-optimized and feature-poor toys.<br>
     <br>
FASHION AND APPEARANCE<br>
     <br>
 Clothes are the lowest priority for an engineer, assuming the basic<br>
thresholds for temperature and decency have been satisfied.  If no <br>
appendages are freezing or sticking together, and if no genitalia or <br>
mammary glands are swinging around in plain view, then the objective of <br>
clothing has been met. Anything else is a waste.<br>
     <br>
LOVE OF "STAR TREK"<br>
     <br>
 Engineers love all of the "Star Trek" television shows and movies. It's<br>
small wonder, since the engineers on the starship Enterprise are <br>
portrayed as heroes, occasionally even having sex with aliens.<br>
     <br>
 This is much more glamorous than the real life of an engineer, which<br>
consists of hiding from the universe and having sex without the <br>
participation of other life forms.<br>
     <br>
DATING AND SOCIAL LIFE<br>
     <br>
 Dating is never easy for engineers.  A normal person will employ<br>
various indirect and duplicitous methods to create a false impression of <br>
attractiveness. Engineers are incapable of placing appearance above <br>
function.<br>
     <br>
 Fortunately, engineers have an ace in the hole.  They are widely<br>
recognized as superior marriage material: intelligent, dependable, <br>
employed, honest, and handy around the house.  While it's true that most <br>
normal people would prefer not to date an engineer, many normal people <br>
harbor an intense desire to mate with them, thus producing engineerlike <br>
children who will have high-paying jobs long before losing their <br>
virginity.<br>
     <br>
 Male engineers reach their peak of sexual attractiveness later than<br>
normal men, becoming irresistible erotic dynamos in their mid thirties <br>
to late forties. Just look at these examples of sexually irresistible <br>
men in technical professions:<br>
     <br>
      *  Bill Gates.<br>
      *  MacGyver.<br>
      *  Etcetera.<br>
     <br>
 Female engineers become irresistible at the age of consent and remain<br>
that way until about thirty minutes after their clinical death. Longer <br>
if it's a warm day.<br>
     <br>
 HONESTY<br>
     <br>
 Engineers are always honest in matters of technology and human<br>
relationships. That's why it's a good idea to keep engineers away from <br>
customers, romantic interests, and other people who can't handle the <br>
truth.<br>
     <br>
 Engineers sometimes bend the truth to avoid work.  They say things that<br>
sound like lies but technically are not because nobody could be expected <br>
to believe them. The complete list of engineer lies is listed below.<br>
     <br>
      "I won't change anything without asking you first." <br>
      "I'll return your hard-to-find cable tomorrow."<br>
      "I have to have new equipment to do my job." <br>
      "I'm not jealous of your new computer."<br>
     <br>
 FRUGALITY<br>
     <br>
 Engineers are notoriously frugal.  This is not because of cheapness or<br>
mean spirit; it is simply because every spending situation is simply a <br>
problem in optimization, that is, "How can I escape this situation while <br>
retaining the greatest amount of cash?"<br>
     <br>
 POWERS OF CONCENTRATION<br>
     <br>
 If there is one trait that best defines an engineer it is the ability<br>
to concentrate on one subject to the complete exclusion of everything <br>
else in the environment.  This sometimes causes engineers to be <br>
pronounced dead prematurely.  Some funeral homes in high-tech areas have <br>
started checking resumes before processing the bodies.  Anybody with a <br>
degree in electrical engineering or experience in computer programming <br>
is propped up in the lounge for a few days just to see if he or she <br>
snaps out of it.<br>
 RISK<br>
     <br>
 Engineers hate risk.  They try to eliminate it whenever they can. This<br>
is understandable, given that when an engineer makes one little mistake, <br>
the media will treat it like it's a big deal or something.<br>
     <br>
 EXAMPLES OF BAD PRESS FOR ENGINEERS<br>
     <br>
  *   Hindenberg.<br>
  *   Space Shuttle Challenger.<br>
  *   Hubble space telescope.<br>
  *   Apollo 13.<br>
  *   Westgate Bridge<br>
  *   P76<br>
  *   Ford Capri<br>
     <br>
  The risk/reward calculation for engineers looks something like this:<br>
     <br>
 RISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people. <br>
 REWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame.<br>
     <br>
 Being practical people, engineers evaluate this balance of risks and<br>
rewards and decide that risk is not a good thing.  The best way to avoid <br>
risk is by advising that any activity is technically impossible for <br>
reasons that are far too complicated to explain.<br>
     <br>
 If that approach is not sufficient to halt a project, then the engineer<br>
will fall back to a second line of defense: "It's technically possible <br>
but it will cost too much."<br>
     <br>
EGO<br>
     <br>
 Ego-wise, two things are important to engineers:<br>
      *   How smart they are.<br>
      *   How many cool devices they own.<br>
     <br>
 The fastest way to get an engineer to solve a problem is to declare<br>
that the problem is unsolvable.  No engineer can walk away from an <br>
unsolvable problem until it's solved.  No illness or distraction is <br>
sufficient to get the engineer off the case.  These types of challenges <br>
quickly become personal -- a battle between the engineer and the laws of <br>
nature.<br>
     <br>
 Engineers will go without food and hygiene for days to solve a problem.<br>
(Other times just because they forgot.)  And when they succeed in <br>
solving the problem they will experience an ego rush that is better than <br>
sex--and that includes the kind of sex where other people are involved.<br>
     <br>
 Nothing is more threatening to the engineer than the suggestion that<br>
somebody has more technical skill.  Normal people sometimes use that <br>
knowledge as a lever to extract more work from the engineer.  When an <br>
engineer says that something can't be done (a code phrase that means<br>
it's <br>
not fun to do), some clever normal people have learned to glance at the <br>
engineer with a look of compassion and pity and say something<br>
along these lines: "I'll ask Bob to figure it out.  He knows how to <br>
solve difficult technical problems."<br>
     <br>
 At that point it is a good idea for the normal person to not stand<br>
between the engineer and the problem.  The engineer will set upon the <br>
problem like a starved Chihuahua on a pork chop.<br>
