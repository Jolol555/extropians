The best exploration of the evolutionary trajectory from something chimp-like<br>
to something human-like has been done by William Calvin. (Try that name and<br>
Ascent of Mind in any search engine to get to his web site.) Chimps lack the<br>
release timing accuracy to throw rocks and hit small targets, they simply<br>
don't have the number of neurons in parallel to reduce the scatter.  But <br>
brains large enough to hit small targets are much more recent than proto <br>
humans hunting.  How did they do it?  Perhaps the most common tool in the <br>
old stone age took kit was a thing called a hand ax.  How these things were <br>
used was the subject for a lot of unsatisfactory discussion until Calvin <br>
suggested they were thrown like a discus into groups of animals at a <br>
water holes.<br>
<p>
Of course, proto humans hunted with hand axes for millions of years <br>
before the big brain expansion during the ice ages.  Calvin connects how <br>
ice ages and brain expansion may be causally related. <br>
<p>
Calvin may not have the last word on this subject, but I would strongly <br>
suggest that anyone who wants to speculate on the origins of human <br>
hunting skills and larger brains absorb Calvin's thoughts on the subject.<br>
