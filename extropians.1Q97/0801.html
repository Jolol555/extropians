For any extropian interested in environmental issues, the "environmentalist<br>
movement" and generally our relationship to nature, I HIGHLY recommend a book<br>
called "No Turning Back" by Wallace Kaufman (1994 Basic Books; ISBN<br>
0-465-05118-9).<br>
<p>
Kaufman is a self-confessed "recovering environmentalist", conservationist<br>
and science journalist.  A listing of chapter titles reveals the scope and<br>
subject matter of the book:<br>
<p>
  Confessions of an Environmentalist<br>
  The Search for Authority<br>
  An Opposition Movement is Born<br>
  The Roots of Environmental Thinking in America<br>
  Searching for a New Sense of the Sacred<br>
  Winning the Public Away from Science<br>
  Nature as We Want It: Can the Environmental Movement Adapt to the New<br>
Ecology?<br>
  Who Owns Nature?<br>
  Technology to the Rescue<br>
  This is Not the End, But the Beginning<br>
<p>
Kaufman, who has been an "insider" in leading environmentalist groups, traces<br>
the anti-scientific development of the American environmental movement from<br>
its roots in late 18th century romanticism through it's modern<br>
anti-capitalist political activism.  He makes a compelling case for privatist<br>
approaches to conservation and the employment of advanced, intelligent<br>
technology to natural resource management issues.  Kaufman explores<br>
scientifically reasonable definitions of "nature" in light of the special<br>
place of humans and current insight into the chaotic nature of complex<br>
systems.  His scientifically critical, but ultimately optimistic, approach to<br>
environmental questions such as global warming, deforestation, wetlands and<br>
wilderness preservation, species extinction, land and other resource use and<br>
human population growth are clear and encouraging expressions of extropian<br>
values.<br>
