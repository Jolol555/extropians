I agree that we need a new calendar. However, for purely technical <br>
reasons. I'd like to be able to specify an event in spacetime, <br>
anywhen, anywhere, with the highest prossible precision, period.<br>
<p>
When the atomic clocks became avalable, events in their vicinity could be <br>
measured very accurately. With the avalability of GPS now both atomic <br>
precision time (well, about one us) and measurements in dm range are <br>
available with relatively inexpensive receivers.<br>
<p>
So why not take a well specified reference point (at the avalability of <br>
sufficiently precise atomic clocks) and counting seconds (using the <br>
SI metric system, which is quite reasonable) from then? I'd like to use <br>
binary clustering, but the decadic number system is also quite adequate, <br>
at least for us mehums. A time stamp made from heterogenous components <br>
like seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months, seasons, years? Switching <br>
seconds? Sweet Jesus.<br>
<p>
The GPS coordinate system is less than fortunate, being geocentric. As our <br>
machines are likely to expand into space in the next decades, using a <br>
heliocentric coordinate system makes more sense. Relativistic corrections <br>
are also much more important then, even though current GPS already must <br>
use them to avoid large errors in position fixes.<br>
