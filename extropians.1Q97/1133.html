I wrote, <br>
<p>
: They say women are discouraged from studying mathematics.  Well, <br>
: I'm sorry.  No doubt, the poor dears are discouraged.  When I see them <br>
: eating one meal a day and spitting blood, then I'll know they are <br>
: serious.  <br>
<p>
To which QueeneMUSE replied:  <br>
<p>
-&gt; Ouch, how come so much hatred?<br>
-&gt; <br>
-&gt; (feeling ill) <br>
<p>
Good.  Now you know what real art is.  (I can hear the reply already:  <br>
"Oh, so that's what real art is.  It makes you sick!"  No, dear...  but <br>
it has an intense effect, for better or worse.  It gets things in focus <br>
so you can't help responding.)<br>
<p>
The point I am making is the same point made by Eugene Leitl, which <br>
you agreed with -- <br>
<p>
-&gt; But I also think that ignoring this brutal truth about willingness <br>
-&gt; and hard work would be a big mistake. The same thing holds true <br>
-&gt; for every one of our "sanctioned victim" beliefs.  <br>
<p>
Brutal truths require brutal prose.  <br>
<p>
Women may be discouraged from being great mathematicians, but then <br>
*everybody* is discouraged.  The obstacles women find in their path <br>
are no worse than the obstacles Abel had to overcome.   The fact that <br>
women are discouraged is not an explanation for the lack of female <br>
mathematicians.  In fact, women do overcome obstacles.  It's just that <br>
they don't do it on the way to becoming mathematicians.  <br>
<p>
This should be too obvious to require explicit argument.  Why isn't it <br>
obvious?  Why do we have to waste our time debating this point?   <br>
 *Because history, like art, has become a memetic billboard.*  <br>
The phenomenon of "political correctness" makes us blind to the <br>
way things are.  Anyone who cares about the truth, or the Truth, <br>
has to fight his way through a maze of illusions.  <br>
<p>
Why the hatred?  I hate lies.  I hate whatever or whoever it is that <br>
makes it impossible for us to see ourselves as we are.   <br>
<p>
