Nation-states tended to come sooner, and took up more of the <br>
totalitarian Justinian code, on the Continent than in Britain.<br>
Remote outposts like Iceland were able to hold out for several<br>
more centuries.  I judge this to be due to the public goods nature<br>
of defense technologies and strategies, favoring centralization more <br>
on the Continent where there is greater exposure to invasion,<br>
and more dependence on fixed agriculture.<br>
<p>
But this trend is not inevitable.  Totalitarian centralization had <br>
earlier reached such stifling proportions in the late Roman Empire that <br>
tribes with Germanic, anarchic codes similar to Iceland's were able <br>
to overrun it.  But in converting from mobile to fixed land <br>
production, the public goods problem among the conquerers came<br>
to resemble those of the Empire, and empires (e.g., Caliphates, <br>
Caroligians) re-emerged, and later still nation-states.<br>
<p>
Our modern U.S. tax code stresses dependence on locale, especially<br>
in the form of mortgage deductions.  This serves to keep subjects<br>
vulnerably fixed, dependent on geographical jurisdictions to solve<br>
their defense problems.  With our transportation and communications<br>
technologies, our mode of production of itself no longer stands in<br>
the way of returnining to non-state law; indeed in the case of the<br>
Internet the application of geographical law is increasingly seen<br>
as ludicrous.  The fixed vulnerability of industrial plant and rail is<br>
giving way to mobile capital, with political  institutions adapting at <br>
their typical excruciatingly slow pace.<br>
<p>
Onwards,<br>
