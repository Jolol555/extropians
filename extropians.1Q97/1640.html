Eric Watt Forste asks:<br>
<i>&gt; What is an "intrinsic value system"?</i><br>
<p>
Pister found a way to put the concept of intrinsic value across clearly. To<br>
the question What good is it?, he replied, What good are you? <br>
<p>
"That answer forces the questioner to confront the fact that he or she<br>
regards his or her own total value to exceed his or her instrumental value.<br>
Many people hope to be instrumentally valuable -- to be useful to family,<br>
friends, and society. But if we prove to be good for nothing, we believe,<br>
nevertheless, that we are still entitled to life, to liberty, to the<br>
pursuit of happiness. (If only instrumentally valuable people enjoyed a<br>
claim to live, the world might not be afflicted with human overpopulation<br>
and overconsumption; certainly we would have no need for expensive<br>
hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and the like.) Human dignity and the<br>
respect it commands -- human ethical entitlement -- is grounded ultimately<br>
in our claim to possess intrinsic value. "<br>
