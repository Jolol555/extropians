I'm saying that I do not know enough about the details of these<br>
disputes to evaluate the degree to which they are counter-examples to<br>
the theory in question.   I gave a long list of the details I wanted.<br>
Sorry - academic theory evaluation really does put a high premium on<br>
paying attention to details.  I'll understand if you don't have the<br>
time for such details.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;What evidence is there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;that *any* people, never mind ordinary ones, act like good Bayesian agents,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;apart from in science?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;With "like" being the key word, lots of evidence.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;it is a standard first approximation.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Can you provide me some references?  I'm always open to evidence :-) but I've</i><br>

<i>&gt;be - good Bayesian agents.</i><br>
<p>
How about the entire literatures in experimental game theory and<br>
decision theory over the last few decades?  Standard journals where<br>
such articles (sporatically) appear include Games and Economic<br>
Behavior, Theory and Decision, American Economic Review, Econometrica,<br>
&amp; lots more with "Game Theory" in the title.  <br>
