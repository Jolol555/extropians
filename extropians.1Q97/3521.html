Tony, then you REALLY MUST see Future Fantastic! They show experiments<br>
where they allowed a guy to see lines and colors by putting a chip on the<br>
optic nerve. I'm very sure you will get your vision back. The optic nerve<br>
doesn't atrophy with that disease correct? I sure hope not.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The problem with Retinal Degenerative Diseases like Retinitis Pigmentosa<br>
and Age Related Macular Degeneration (of which most people will develop<br>
unless aging is slowed)  is that the retinal cells die. How will these<br>
chips work with inactive cells?<br>
<p>
The optic nerve remains intact but there are claims it is too difficult<br>
to attach to. This amazes me since my sisters cochlear implant and newest<br>
speach processor have returned almost all her hearing. How is the optic<br>
nerve so much different from the auditory nerve that we can successful<br>
interface with the auditory nerve but not with the optic nerve?<br>
<p>
There is a Cuban doctor that claims he has developed a way to bring these<br>
cells back to life using a combination of ozone therapy and electric<br>
shock. Despite claims from his patients  that ithe procedure returned<br>
some of their vision, the international medical community have not<br>
verified the results, nor been able to monitor the Cuban implementation.<br>
<p>
Other research on retina's I'm aware of include: <br>
<p>
Nutrition: a 7 year study concluded in '92-93' by the RP Foundation,<br>
Fighting Blindness determined 15,000 IUs of vitamin A palmitate could<br>
reduce retinal degeneration in RP patients by as much as 7 years while<br>
400 IU supplements of vitamin E seemed to accelerate retinal<br>
deteriouration. Bilberry extract has also been used to enhance night<br>
vision. <br>
<p>
Cell transplant: experiments have been done in rabbits that demonstrate<br>
that transplanting healthy epithelial cells into a diseased retina may<br>
halt further deterioration (rescue) but not rejuvenate dead cells<br>
(recovery)<br>
<p>
What I've read so farindicates that  whole retinal transplants are<br>
impractical due to the delicate, thin nature of the retina, and that<br>
whole eye transplants are impractical due to inability of connecting to<br>
the optic nerve.<br>
<p>
Corning makes an amber colored photo-sensitive glasses lens that is used<br>
to enhance depth perception and reduce glare. I wonder if this kind of<br>
thing could lead to some sort of cornea cover for  normal sighted people<br>
or, fearing decline in sale of sun glasses, would the Optics industry<br>
thwart it.<br>
<p>
 If we can incorporate CCTV  magnification technology, OCR (Optical<br>
Charachter Recognition), and light filtering mechanisms,  with<br>
biological/artificial eyes,  subcutaneous computer chips, and the optic<br>
nerve, we'd be in a good position to cure many forms of blindness. We'd<br>
also greatly enhance human ability to use our sense of sight in far<br>
greater ways.<br>
<p>
 Can you imagine not needing pigeons in U.S. Coast Guard Search &amp; Rescue<br>
helicoptors to search for shipreck victims because the human eye is even<br>
more acute? Can you imagine periodically going into the shop to recieve<br>
new eyes as our old ones deteriorate? Far range vision, macro-micro, UV,<br>
IR, thermal imaging, photo sensitive shading, downloading everything you<br>
saw that day to computer backup, - endless possibilities.  The ultimate<br>
would be interfacing computer  output directly into your optic nerve<br>
without needing a monitor to give new meanings to the terms  VR and<br>
portability .<br>
<p>
peace, love, and understanding<br>
