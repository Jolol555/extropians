It would take a few generations at least for cloning to become this<br>
widespread.  After all, most people would want to wait and see how the<br>
first generation grew up, and there'd be lots to learn about how to<br>
deal with the situations cloning creates.  I think that by the time<br>
this could have a big effect, upload clones will be possible. <br>
