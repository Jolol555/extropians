Now you're mixing analogies.  Seems to me that the advantage of argument<br>
from analogy is the use of one, more thuroughly understood process to<br>
elucidate another based on apparent similarities; it certainly *proves*<br>
nothing.  Now you've got gravity *and* propulsion; i can't follow.  I would<br>
like to point out that the analogy in its original state does not break down<br>
as you seem to imply here:<br>

Neither is a star a point mass; it too has internal forces.  The analogy can<br>
be maitained, could it be that you just didn't like where it was going?<br>

P.S.  To the extropians; i saw on Big Life last night that your purpose is<br>
to accelerate human evolution.  How do you feel about communal cognition?<br>
It's based on the assumption that whatever works between neurons to make us<br>
can work between us to make something orders of magnitude more intelligent.<br>
All that's required is that a particular functionality be imparted to social<br>
interactions.  Any thoughts?<br>
