<i>&gt;The author of this site has pulled together many different</i><br>
<i>&gt;arguments to prove his point. So take a look. I was amazed at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;number of misunderstandings and misconceptions. At least in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;astronomy portion that I looked at. It's like the author heard a fact,</i><br>
<i>&gt;took it out of context, and wove a logical theory around it. (This</i><br>
<i>&gt;sort of twisting of facts reminds me quite a bit of the Communist</i><br>
<i>&gt;propaganda that I have seen and read, in the past.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To give you an idea, I am posting below some of the astronomy "arguments"</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I saw there. FYI, only. (I don't have the time to discuss astronomy</i><br>
<i>&gt;with these people, although it is really tempting.)</i><br>

That creationist drivel demonstrated an appalling amount of ignorance in the<br>
most fundamental areas of science.  Makes me shiver just thinking that these<br>
types of people exist in our society.  The worst part is that they are<br>
comfortable in their ignorance.  You could do an immaculate dissection of<br>
that post and they still would hold to their original beliefs.<br>
