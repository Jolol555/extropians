<i>&gt; a crossword puzzle. The bits forming this sentence both participate in it</i><br>

<i>&gt; be extended, a bit like the scenario in _Permutation City_. </i><br>
<p>
But how do you escape from the universe where you are now, into another?<br>
According to the scenario you describe, other universes already exist,<br>
you don't create them by starting to simulate them. So suppose you're<br>
Trans-Anders, stuck in a collapsing universe where a Tiplerian Omega Point<br>
won't happen, and you simulate a few timeslices from a Dyson universe in <br>
which Trans-Anders gets to expand boundlessly. At the end of the simulation,<br>
you remain where you were; and your Other Self exists regardless of<br>
whether you conduct your simulation or not.<br>
<p>
Of the various schemes for literal immortality that I've heard of,<br>
I'd rank the Linde scenario as the likeliest sounding, with Dyson<br>
a close second, Tipler third, and Moravec/Egan fourth. <br>
