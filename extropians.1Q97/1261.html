<i>&gt; &gt;Superstition, myth, aphorisms, dogma, and the like /are/ successful.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Even as an unwavering advocate of reason, I can see their value in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;few contexts:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;* Teaching children how to behave in terms they can understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  and use while they're in the process of learning why;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;* To supply shortcuts, rules of thumb, that can be used to make timely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  decisions about newly-encountered situations when there isn't time</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  for rigorous analysis;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;* To provide examples (in the form of myths) to explain principles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The focus on effect is good, but a 'deceptive' causal explanation</i><br>
<i>&gt;  could be counter-productive down the road.  It's a gamble that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  sometimes 'pays' and sometimes doesn't.  Such memes have high value of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  effectiveness, but not as high a value of rendering understanding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;So why not create extropian myths, aphorisms, holidays, idioms?  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fact, the resistance to do so might give us the false impression that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;those we create inadvertantly have more meaning than they do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  On one hand, there is much gained by solidifying vision through symbols</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and abstractions of cause and effect.  On the other hand, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  'competing gods' syndrome is what creates the greatest faults in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the Christ legend.  (Jesus/Y'shua himself said 'Why do you call me</i><br>
<i>&gt;  good? None is good but the Father.'  Yet, people EQUATED him to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Father, against his intentions.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Perhaps we're already on the right path there... We villify Entropy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  even though it can have some place outside of Extropy.  We deify</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Spontaneous Order, even though it might allow for harmful complexity</i><br>
<i>&gt;  or stiffling stability.  Singularity sounds remarkably adventist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I must say, though, that I find not a single thing worthwhile about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Jesus's teachings at all.  He is the classic self-sacrificial altruist,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Altruism is a mixed bag.  It is the ultimate discipline to have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  self control over one's choices to execute perfect actions while</i><br>
<i>&gt;  overriding mortal fear.  The judgemental Church still doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;  understand just how great it is that he didn't 'take personal' his</i><br>
<i>&gt;  own murderous execution. On the other hand, it seems to me that few</i><br>
<i>&gt;  extropians would have respect of a decission to let principle permit</i><br>
<i>&gt;  such a death, if that was ever his intent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (Read on about his so-called 'death.')</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mindlessly vengeful (e.g., the fig tree),</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  ...a 'competing gods' legend borrowed from Hinduism...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;praising "faith" (mysticism and uncritical acceptance of dogma),</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  There's another Church-perverted term... The word "Faith" never meant</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "blind belief" but rather "Commitment."  (Faithful to marriage, faithful</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to contracts...)  It was recognized that such faith prerequired a certain</i><br>
<i>&gt;  amount of trust, but when trust was questioned, the Church later</i><br>
<i>&gt;  oversimplified it down to belief.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The extropian counterpart would be 'Self-Confidence,' which is just</i><br>
<i>&gt;  as easy to criticize, yet no less valued.  It too can move mountains.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"hope" (begging for supernatural favors instead of working</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to better yourself),</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Hope is much better than Hopelessness as long as it's not misplaced.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Ironically, the only two things that Jesus would pray about were</i><br>
<i>&gt;  natural providence (daily bread), and self-fulfilling matters (forgiveness,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  praise, and workers for the field...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and "charity" (self-sacrifice and self-loathing).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  True, one of his most misplaced (or misinterperated?) instructions was to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  take up one's cross.  Could it be that people misunderstood the irony with</i><br>
<i>&gt;  which he spoke that?:  In seeking one's life they lose it, but in giving</i><br>
<i>&gt;  one's life they find it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;He was anti-capitalist ("camel through the needle's eye..."),</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;pro-government ("render unto Caesar...").</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  If he says to pay your dues to Caesar and teaches the value of coins,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  he can hardly be called "anti-capitalist."  Non-capitalist perhaps,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  he indicates that there are many greater values in a human economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  He said 'it is *greater* to give than to recieve,' but not 'worthless</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to receive.'</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  As for the Caesar bit, I thought this exhibits genius:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It's a funny punchline to a bitter issue of taxation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It is the most simple and eliquent solution as to the issues of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  justice that divided a people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Give Caesar what is Caesar's, Give God what is God's."</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It is one of history's first documented lessons in Appropriate Scale vs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Totalitarianism... a lesson we are only now gaining in firm grasp as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  we move from a bigger-is-better industrial era to the information age.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;To hell with him, I'll pick my own heroes.  "And yea, Feynmann</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;said unto his students..."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Yes we will all value different role models... It will be difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to find one that would be undebatable until someone *really* comes</i><br>
<i>&gt;  along who can put an end to death.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The Church has covered up much evidence that Jesus NEVER REALLY DIED on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the cross.  This is spoken of in the Quran, that 'he was never killed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  but the Jews merely *thought* that they had killed him.'  The Shroud</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of Turin, if found authentic, corroberates this as well.  The most damning</i><br>
<i>&gt;  evidence is in the Bible itself: That the spear caused blood and water to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  come pouring out his side.  This would not be the case of a man whose heart</i><br>
<i>&gt;  had supposedly stopped moments before.  (For those who have an interest</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in this, check out the book "The Jesus Conspiracy.")  He may have even gone</i><br>
<i>&gt;  into his fate with the assurance of resuscitation.</i><br>
<p>
While the Shroud of Turin has been determined to be not of Y'shua's era,<br>
there is significant info that contradicts the catholic/orthodox<br>
"Bible", or presents info in it in the proper context. For example: at<br>
the time, to be called rabbi meant that you WERE a Rabbi, and Rabbis of<br>
the time HAD to be married, so who was Y'shua's wife? Its obvious that<br>
since he was the master of the cermony at Cannae whome the servats<br>
deferred to when wine came up short, and again referring to actual<br>
Hebrew culture, he was the guy getting married at Cannae. Also, since<br>
Mary Magdalene was brought to him over her adultery, as well as her<br>
familial heritage being from the house of King Saul (and Y'shua's<br>
heritage being from the two houses of David), as well as some other<br>
stuff, including his close relations with Mary's sister and brother<br>
Lazarus, that Mary Magdalene was his wife. This brings us to the point<br>
of what was really going on. SOme people have concluded from this sort<br>
of analysis that Y'shua was simply part of a Hebrew Royal scheme to<br>
depose the Herod's and oust the Romans. Seeing how much support he got<br>
from the populace at Passover indicates  the level to which people saw<br>
the Hebrew Royals as not only having secular authority, but spiritual<br>
authority, which would explain why he was able to attain such a<br>
following as well as arouse the hatred of both political and spiritual<br>
leaders in power.<br>
<p>
Now, seeing as how his wife was of the House of Saul, it would follow<br>
that it wasn't Y'shua that was seen as the savior, but his Son who would<br>
unite all the Houses of Isreal.<br>
<p>
Here's additional tricky theory: Golgotha was not the site of the<br>
crucifixtion, as he was strung up in the garden of John of Aramathea (a<br>
relative and local politician), in whose tomb Y'shua was "buried" to<br>
recover from his possible drug induced state in peace, to be<br>
"resurrected" three days later.<br>
<p>
Biblical contradiction: If Christ was convicted of religious violations,<br>
why was he not stoned, as was the prescribed punishment, rather than<br>
crucified, which was specifically reserved for leaders of rebellions<br>
against the City and People of Rome (which would be expected if he were<br>
a political aspirant)? The whole last scenes always seemed too damn<br>
contrived to me, very uncharacteristic of the characters involved.<br>
<p>
I recommend the book "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" to anyone interested in<br>
this line of reasoning. I can't remember the authors, but it looks at<br>
all these contradictions, plus info from the Gospels of Thomas and Mary,<br>
as well as info about the Merovingian Kings of Gaul (descended from the<br>
Fisher King of Marseilles of the 2nd century) who have been linked to<br>
the whole Arthurian/Masonic Mythos....<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  This is a unique century that will uncover a great number of historic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  discrepancies regarding the Bible.  Just over fifty years ago were the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Dead Sea Scrolls uncovered, and they don't corroberate everthing they</i><br>
<i>&gt;  were expected to.  Post-King-James revisions omit entire chapters that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  are not true to earlier manuscripts.  'Apocryphal' books and gospels</i><br>
<i>&gt;  show a side to Jesus never seen before.  (I for one love 'The Gospel of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Thomas,' most likely omitted for its equality of sexes.)</i><br>
<p>
As well as the Gospel of Mary!!!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I will not worship a Christ legend, but I do find many praiseworthy</i><br>
<i>&gt;  characteristics to the historic Y'shua.  A humorist and healer,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  he was 'deified' without his wishes.  His fellow jews prefered the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  judgemental vigilance of his cousin John the Baptist.  But Jesus</i><br>
<i>&gt;  was a party-loving contrast to John:</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "For John the Baptist came neither eating bread</i><br>
<i>&gt;         nor drinking wine, and you say, `He has a demon.'</i><br>
<i>&gt;         The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you</i><br>
<i>&gt;         say, `Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         friend of tax collectors and "sinners."'</i><br>
<i>&gt;         But wisdom is proved right by all her children." Luke 7:33-35</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I don't have totalitarian views of forcing the world to worship him.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (Neither did Jesus... When he said to go baptizing into all the world,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  he was talking about purifying people through bathing, not building</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Synagogs of indoctrination!)  But if Wisdom is proved right by all</i><br>
<i>&gt;  her children, then I will likely share in the admiration of your heroes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  whether or not you value mine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I for one gotta admire a guy who teaches his fellow Jews to be more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  accepting and tollerant of each other, working to bring humor and healing</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to everyone around him. (Whew! That was some load off my chest!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
And to create a meme that would survive the longest history of mutation<br>
and parasitism yet retaining its essential, central truth far longer<br>
than any other.<br>
