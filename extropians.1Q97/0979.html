<i>&gt; While exploring Hugo de Garis's web site on brain building </i><br>
<i>&gt; I came across this rant on political correctness. He claims that </i><br>
<i>&gt; genius is an undeniably male trait. I would be interested </i><br>
<i>&gt; if anyone has a reasonable argument against his views  </i><br>
<p>
Here are two samples of the reasonable arguments that appeared on the <br>
list:  <br>
<p>
1.  From Eliezer Yudkowsky:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Dr. de Garis, you are a raving lunatic with no more chance of </i><br>
<i>&gt; matching my SAT scores than you have of flying, regardless of </i><br>
<i>&gt; how many Y chromosomes you happen to be born with.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let me share a secret with you.  A test designed by *any*</i><br>
<i>&gt; socio-political-economic group, any group whatsoever, will </i><br>
<i>&gt; weed out all those not of that group.  If the poor designed tests, </i><br>
<i>&gt; they would weed out the rich.  It would come as absolutely </i><br>
<i>&gt; no surprise whatsoever to find that the 14:1 SAT ratios you cite </i><br>
<i>&gt; are being achieved on an SAT designed by a committee with </i><br>
<i>&gt; 14 male members and 1 female member... or certainly one with a </i><br>
<i>&gt; male committee chairman.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's all very well to place oneself at the apex of a hierarchy you</i><br>
<i>&gt; design... until you wind up at the bottom of someone else's hierarchy. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am a member of an SAT-scoring group which damn well certainly </i><br>
<i>&gt; excludes you, regardless of how many females happen to be in it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've decided to form a club of geniuses.  You, of course, are not </i><br>
<i>&gt; invited.  It's not in your genetic destiny.  You'll never match a </i><br>
<i>&gt; *real*  genius, because I don't recall any *real* geniuses </i><br>
<i>&gt; (think of exclusionary criteria...) with a Japanese email address!  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, virtually every invention I've ever heard of was designed by an </i><br>
<i>&gt; American, and no genius *I've* ever heard of was Japanese.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact, although I happen to be making this statistic up, only 1 out of </i><br>
<i>&gt; 14 top SAT scorers, in the Midwest, are Japanese.</i><br>
<p>
2.  From E Shaun Russell: <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 'Genius' can (obviously, IMO) be either male or female.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If one person says that this fact is otherwise, I don't understand how </i><br>
<i>&gt; the majority of the listeners don't just brush it off as foolhardy.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is mainly the reason why I wished the "Political Correctness" </i><br>
<i>&gt; thread to be quelled...it is insulting to our intelligence (again, IMO). </i><br>
<p>
That's pretty much what I would expect from Shaun Russell.  I would <br>
expect better from Eliezer, but when the dogma of equality is challenged,  <br>
apparently even he is eager to reduce himself to the same level as Shaun.  <br>
What happened to those fine proclamations about Truth? -- "I think that <br>
the truth takes precedence over anyone's feelings, including my own."  <br>
Never mind.  <br>
<p>
Now David Musick asks:  Is there any reason to be optimistic that <br>
Reason will finally prevail?  <br>
<p>
David answers in the affirmative.  I disagree.  I don't think reason will <br>
finally prevail.  I think what will happen is, the word "Reason" will be <br>
increasingly invoked as a code-word, but reason itself will not prevail <br>
on the internet any more than anywhere else.  On the contrary:  <br>
the very people who go on and on about "Reason" will be the first to <br>
*quell* inquiries into matters that they don't want to see discussed.  <br>
