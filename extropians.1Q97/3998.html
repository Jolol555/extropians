In a message dated 97-03-24 21:25:34 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Bottom line is: transhumanists *are* close to Nazis in the sense of<br>
 wanting to create better people.  They differ from Nazis in not trying<br>
 to achieve this goal by killing off "inferior" people.  But Nazis are<br>
 such a reviled prototype that simple heuristic case-based inference<br>
 (anything too much reminiscint of Nazis must be bad) *does* make many<br>
 people reject the whole enterprize.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
You are correct that this is an emotional heuristic, quite a knee jerker too.<br>
I understand the connection here, and agree that there is a connection "in<br>
mind"<br>
between transhumanism and eugenics. However, the Nazi comparison is one that<br>
we might want to handle delicately and swiftly. Facism and (conquering)<br>
imperialism both have no place in future politics and do not support economic<br>
freedom nor individual freedom, two very fundamental stepping stones to any<br>
sort of "Politi-Extropica" . Making people better is only *one* very<br>
fundamental aspect of Extropy, and to take what you say one step further, not<br>
only do we oppose 'killing off inferior people', we oppose force of any sort,<br>
even for inferiors, and even "for thier own good".<br>
