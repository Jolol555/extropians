not that case with much wealth that is inherited, and &gt;thus, not earned.<br>
<p>
What is the difference between: inheriting money, that money being given to<br>
the children just before death, and having parents spend their money to<br>
raise their child ? How can a new born child pay for his mothers milk ?<br>
<p>
You're using partly survivalist theory here to justify your view. In that<br>
light:<br>
<p>
The money was earned by the parents, who (also upon their death) spend that<br>
money investing in the future wellbeing of their genetic codes.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Here's a proposal that links in with the clone thread: ANy individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;has a right to the sanctity of his or her own genetic coding, but is</i><br>
<i>&gt;also legally and financially responsible for any liabilities incurred &gt;in</i><br>
the dissemination of said genetic coding. THis brings in a concept &gt;that<br>
one must be able to afford the reproduction of one's coding, &gt;from not only<br>
birth, but to adulthood. Reproduction becomes a long &gt;term investment<br>
(30-40 years to maturity) that one can not collect &gt;on.<br>
<p>
Why 30-40 years ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;of course, this is a politically impossible scenario, as the vast</i><br>
<i>&gt;majority of people having kids cannot rationally afford to have them</i><br>
<i>&gt;when they do, adn would go on the warpath against anyone trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;interfere with their right to reproduce. </i><br>
<p>
In many european countries wages are based on age, either by law or by the<br>
influence governement (the largest employer) has on wages. Many examples<br>
are known of starting wages 3 times smaller than wages near the end of<br>
careers (for doing the same work). IMO setting those free, would already<br>
solve part of this problem, which is actual, not hypothetical, since many<br>
people here already ethically feel what you are saying here: <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just as one must demonstrate financial responsibility to drive a car &gt;in</i><br>
most states (insurance), people should have to demostrate &gt;financial<br>
responsibility to have kids. <br>
<p>
Nature gave no individual (1 that is, not 2) the right to reproduce.<br>
We changed that by allowing sperm to be sold commercially, allowing half of<br>
our population that individual right. We also gave ourselves the right NOT<br>
to reproduce. <br>
<p>
Weighing the childs individual rights in such matters is difficult. Today<br>
the situation exists (where abortion is legal), where a child is the<br>
property of an individual with 50% (or 51% ;-)) until a few moths before it<br>
is born.<br>
<p>
These problems are very difficult ones, and maybe a system should be<br>
developed where kids become 'universal' on different levels. Adding<br>
responsabilities and taking away priviliges once it has proven to be<br>
capable of taking them / doing without them ?<br>
