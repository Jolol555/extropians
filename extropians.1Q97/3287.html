Wrong. If government works correctly, you don't work for the state but the state <br>
works for you. <br>
<p>
I *do* agree that this is often not the case today. That's what I want to improve. <br>
The problem is that government is too corrupt and influenced (usually even set up) <br>
by economy. For government does not have a general interest in acting "evil", but big <br>
biz has, in order to<br>
  <br>
	- sell more<br>
	- get rid of competitors<br>
	- get state subventions<br>
	- pay fewer taxes<br>
<p>
they would do anything they can. In non-anarchies this is a bit limited (they can't <br>
simply burn down their weaker enemies' factories), but as anarchies are not workable <br>
this is the only possibility they see.<br>
<p>
And don't forget that all large companies are practically owned by investment banks <br>
like Morgan Stanley or Brown Brothers Harriman. There is no free market or real <br>
competition, just a search for the highes profit rates.<br>
<p>
In addition, those who do the hardest physical work (workers in factories, farmers <br>
etc.) usually get the fewest money in capitalist systems and have to pay (relatively) <br>
the most. For one who gets a million each month could pay 995,000 and still live <br>
quite good. But one who gets 400 $ each month will have problems with paying 100 $ of <br>
taxes.<br>

<i>&gt; get by, and leaves me lots of time for individual development. Don't call</i><br>
<i>&gt; it lazyness, call it rational behaviour in states that have maximum income</i><br>

<p>
Wrong. I will only argue for Germany. We have a maximum income tax scale of 53 % <br>
(which is supposed to be shortened to 40 % this year), but nobody pays that much. It <br>
isn't different in the USA or anywhere else. Those who "work" more and make more <br>
money (mainly by being unscrupulous and corrupt) often don't pay any taxes as all, as <br>
they can afford the best tax advisors available.<br>
<p>
That's why the share of wealth in Germany is so unjust. With 4,7 million people <br>
unemployed, 150,000 millionaires and about 50 billionaires it is obvious that the <br>
problem is not government, but economy.<br>
<p>
Ah, and they have about 60 % MITS in Japan. <br>
<p>
Freedom is an illusion. Free markets cannot exist, because money accumulates and <br>
companies get more powerful the more money they have. They don't spend this money in <br>
developing better products, but in advertising their existing ones and getting rid of <br>
their competitors. If companies invest, they do not invest in employees but in what <br>
promises the highest profit. <br>
<p>
Capitalism is the true pyramid system. Lots of people pay and few get the money. In <br>
the end, there's mass poverty, hunger and a few very, very rich (but usually not very <br>
clever) guys.<br>
<p>
I only see one motivation that drives all Libertarians. It's not the desire for <br>
freedom or the desire for justics. It's pure greed. Oh yeah, and in some cases it's <br>
stupidity.<br>
<p>
