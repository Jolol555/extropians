In a message dated 97-03-22 19:59:41 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;  For even mentioning that someday we might move beyond race, I  <br>
 was called a racist.  For stating that I don't worship anything, I  <br>
 was reviled as heartless and cold.  For wishing that people could  <br>
 learn to relate beyond gender roles, I was considered anti-woman.   <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt; </i><br>
 <br>
Those ideas are expected from the politically correct do-nothings of our<br>
society.  They have trapped themselves.  You did not let them trap you.<br>
 Nothing in history has been unanimously accepted. Even the best ideas had<br>
opposition.  My advice is:  Don't pay any attention to your critics, don't<br>
even ignore them. <br>
