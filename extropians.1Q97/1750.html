Thanks for forwarding Ian's post.  I can see much more clearly where you are<br>
coming from now.  The vision he describes is what I see as a viewpoint into<br>
something we might call the vortex of transformation.  Many people would be<br>
horrified by much of what he says, but I feel that there are other factors<br>
involved that would make it a very enjoyable future -- that is once we <br>
finally get out of the birth canal.<br>
<p>
Ah yes, we are back to the old bootstrap problems which is why I didn't<br>
catch your drift earlier.  Seems like the big questions are what we <br>
should do or not to to bring it about, and how much patience we need<br>
to have while going about this?<br>
