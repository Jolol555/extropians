It seems that if you can even recognize that another being ( or another<br>
universe? ) is reversed in time to yourself, you have enough information<br>
transfer to be able to communicate sufficiently to trigger the above<br>
paradox.<br>
Therefore, either 1) we can't even know of their existence, or 2) we have<br>
a paradox.  Separate universes?<br>
<p>
Hmm...maybe a third possibility is one-way communication, but that <br>
argues against symmetry...I'm in over my head here.<br>
