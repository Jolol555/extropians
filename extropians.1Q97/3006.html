I'm just reading Kauffman's book now. Version 3.0 of the Extropian<br>
Principles won't be completed for a while since I have other urgent writing<br>
priorities. When I get back to it I'll certainly consider whether<br>
"Self-Organization" should replace "Spontaneous Order" as the name of that<br>
principle. Note, thout, that this principle will most likely be in<br>
*addition* to Self-Ownership rather than the latter replacing the former<br>
(as I originally thought).<br>
