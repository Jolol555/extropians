I would highly recommend east Asia as a place to reside, especially the<br>
developing countries.  I have several friends (as well as myself) who have<br>
property interests in various developing Asian countries.  Many are slowly<br>
moving their assets overseas.  Most of the developing Asian countries are<br>
friendly to Americans and Europeans.  Often the government in these<br>
countries is effectively non-existant, and generally won't bother you.<br>
<p>
Probably the two best (IMO) east Asian countries to reside are <br>
1) Thailand: Anarchy for all intents and purposes.  However, a little<br>
underdeveloped technologically and economically for my tastes.  I know<br>
people who love the place though.  Probably the closest thing to usable<br>
freedom you'll find. <br>
and,<br>
2) The Philippines: A cleaner, better run country than Thailand, with a more<br>
developed economy and technology base (e.g. they have a decent Internet<br>
backbone).  The government is a little more prevalent than in Thailand, but<br>
is generally minimalist and non-intrusive.  Most government presence is in<br>
the resource monopolies (energy, water, etc.), which are being privatized as<br>
I write this.<br>
<p>
I have actively investigated many Asian countries for moving my residence<br>
eventually, and my personal choice has been with the Philippines.  I just<br>
acquired 3 nice houses on the island of Cebu for minimal cash (which I am<br>
renting out currently).  I am actively pursuing the purchase of an entire<br>
island that I intend to develop from the ground up per my design (the<br>
Philippines has 7000 islands, the majority of which are uninhabited).<br>
Prices are cheap.  You can purchase a large, gorgeous estate with an<br>
enormous house on a private beach for less than USD $100k.  A very nice<br>
house in the cities shouldn't cost you more than USD $50k.  I plan to start<br>
actively developing that country sometime in the next 5 years.  In 5 years<br>
or so, I may permanently move my residence overseas.<br>
