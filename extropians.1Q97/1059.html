[Lyle:]<br>
<i>&gt; In other words, *speed* of thought has very little to do with it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you speed up somebody's thought processes but leave his ontology </i><br>
<i>&gt; the same, he will just miss the point a hundred times faster.  </i><br>
<p>
Two points:  First, my own specialty, Algernon's Law, does not speed up<br>
thinking, but indeed alters the ontology.  Second, computer uploading<br>
would simply give you several million objective years in which to alter<br>
yourself and upgrade your ontology.  Third, I am not aware of any human<br>
philosopher who has spent a million years thinking about *anything*;<br>
maybe we would miss the point the first time around, or even the first<br>
ten times around, but given enough time we *would* eventually get the<br>
point.  Even a normal human who lived for a few trillion years could<br>
probably figure out most of the Secrets of The Universe.<br>
