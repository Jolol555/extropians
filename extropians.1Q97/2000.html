Omega, your "Free Will vs Group Think" post of 1/27/97 is excellent.  It is<br>
always a pleasure to see reason in play.<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;Since science, by definition, does not deal with the unknowable<br>
(except for defining the boundaries of such) the scientific appraisal of<br>
free will is limited to refuting its presence wherever predictibility can<br>
be found.  This leads to an operative principle which places knowable<br>
limits on where free will may be found as defined in its classical sense:<br>
<p>
*  Where something is predictable, then free will does not exist.&gt;<br>
<p>
A slight refinement to make this more precise, predictable here means "with<br>
certainty."  Prediction with less than 100% statistical confidence is,<br>
after all, just guesswork.  Is an entity forced to make predictions in<br>
order to find out if the entity has free will?  &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;...once we strip out all references to local truth in this new<br>
definition of free will, we are back to one of two possibilities:<br>
<p>
a. Either free will does not exist at all...<br>
<p>
b. Or, through some form of trancendent acausality in keeping with the<br>
first<br>
   meaning, some limited form of free will does exist...<br>
<p>
And now that quantum physics has clearly been shown to be unable to tell us<br>
whether our reality is even a deterministic one or not, the whole subject<br>
is<br>
right back in the realm of philosophy/theology/metaphysics.&gt;<br>
<p>
Since the necessity of indeterministic quantum physics has forced us to go<br>
back to philosophy now, I would like to post a couple quotes on point b<br>
(point a being obviously worthless because I am choosing to respond of my<br>
own free will) from Karl Jaspers' "Way to Wisdom" (Yale Univ. Press, 1951):<br>
<p>
"The highest freedom is experienced in freedom from the world, and this<br>
freedom is a profound bond with transcendence....  [M]astery over one's<br>
ideas remains ambivalent ­ does it mean an arbitrary freedom from ties or<br>
does it imply ties in transcendence?  Because of this ambivalence,<br>
independence, instead of becoming a road to authentic selfhood in historic<br>
fulfilment, can easily be confused with irresponsibility, or the perpetual<br>
availability for something else.  Then selfhood is lost, and all that<br>
remains is different roles played in different situations."<br>
