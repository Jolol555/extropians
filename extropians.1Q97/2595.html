"Providing access to content is not sufficient to guarentee effective<br>
message passing. A message delivered but ignored, or a message ingested<br>
but not digested, is not useful. In order to inform, the "recipient"<br>
must find the message content engaging and relevant. It is the<br>
contention of the News in the Future group at MIT Media Labatory that<br>
effective communication requires distribution of messages that are rich<br>
in description. These descriptions, when taken with consideration of the<br>
context of both the individiduals and the communities recieving them,<br>
can result in messages that are both engaging and useful." [W. Bender,<br>
opening to his article, "Community and Personalization", from the IBM<br>
Systems Journal, Vol35, Nos.3&amp;4, 1996] <br>
<p>
There has been some recent debate on this Elist concerning cookies. One<br>
extreme is to turn them off [for the sake privacy] so your browser does<br>
not accept them. However, I'd like to propose the *choice* or *option*<br>
to take something of the opposite extreme, a meta-cookie.<br>
<p>
I would like the internet and specifically the content of the internet,<br>
to attempt to adapt to me. In order for it to do this, I must have a<br>
standard though revisable description of myself available to any server<br>
I browse to. I would call this a meta-cookie. The meta-cookie would<br>
enable content providers to make the content I recieve more "engaging<br>
and useful". I want the Internet to adapt, at least in a temporal<br>
fashion, to my presence.  <br>
<p>
The meta-cookie could have general information such as name, preferred<br>
alias, age, sex, race, locality, interests, favorite colour,<br>
myers-briggs result, education, fixations and perversions, etcetera,<br>
etcetera. As we begin to understand the science of personalization<br>
better, future versions of the meta-cookie could have more useful<br>
variables.<br>
<p>
I don't particularly care what people know about me. As far as I'm<br>
concerned the more the better. The only illegal thing I do is use<br>
lysergic acid diethylamide-25. And since I do not consider my use of it<br>
a criminal activity [though the governement and many individuals do],<br>
I'm not about to hide the fact. If some one can use this information to<br>
incremenate me, good. That gives me the opportunity to stand up for my<br>
belief in Freedom of Consciousness. Often the legalization of something<br>
requires that first people be arrrested for doing it, and then<br>
attempting to show how the law is unconstitutional. Now I do not want to<br>
suggest that I know a great deal about the legal system, but my main<br>
point is that I'm not concerned with people knowing what I do or say, be<br>
it taboo, perverse, illegal, revolutionary, or otherwise.<br>
<p>
I think this over concern for encryption and privacy only hinders ideas<br>
such as personalization. Perhaps I share the hacker ethic [see the<br>
hacker manifesto], that all information should be available in the open.<br>
I'm not too pleased with the idea that my governement hides information<br>
from me in the name of "national security* while it continues to play<br>
primitive war games with other nations.<br>
<p>
I believe the use of encryption is like trying to cure a symptom rather<br>
than the problem. It seems superficially western within a medical<br>
analogy. Perhaps we should attempt to reform government and society so<br>
that we do not feel such a need for encryption and information privacy.  <br>
Fantasizing for a moment, I think it would be nice if one day we created<br>
the technology that allowed us to read each other's minds. I don't care<br>
if someone knows what I'm thinking. It would certainly make games like<br>
poker fairly obsolete, but it would improve communication considerably.<br>
<p>
On the topic of the meta-cookie. Such information would certainly make<br>
it possible for prejudice and selected information withholding. Fine,<br>
thats what I want. Thats part of personalization. If I go to a site, and<br>
it doesn't offer me information on such and such because my favortie<br>
song is, "The Purple People Eater", then thats fine. If I really want<br>
the information, I can turn off my meta-cookie and return to the site,<br>
or I could even rewrite my meta-cookie so that it would be found<br>
appealing to the site I'm browsing to.<br>
<p>
I like the meta-cookie idea better than having to time and time again<br>
type my personal info in for sites. The meta-cookie would facillitate<br>
filling out forms, the site already has access to your general<br>
information, while facillitating also the creation of more site-specific<br>
cookies. <br>
<p>
In general I believe cookies are going to facillitate a major evolution<br>
in education. Education is going to become more and more so<br>
personalized, less authoritarian. <br>
<p>
I think I will go make my suggestion to Netscape and Microsoft now.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
