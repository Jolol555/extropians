Omega, this is tying up loose ends, just in case you're peering in from the<br>
disengaged ethereal limbo all lurkers inhabit.<br>
<p>
First, we were exploring the curious coordination dynamics between the<br>
physiological *way* in which Feynman thought, and *what* he thought of in<br>
mathematically semantic terms.  *How* he thought was *why* he described how<br>
reality works.  A section of this follows:<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;The genius of Feynman was often attributed to the fact that in the<br>
middle of a difficult problem, he would stop what he was doing and suddenly<br>
shift to a different viewpoint.&gt;<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Voila!  Sum-over-the-perspectives/sum-over-the-histories describes<br>
reality.  Russell (the positivists) and independently Edmund Husserl, were<br>
working on this line at about the same time roughly a full generation<br>
before Feynman's breakthroughs, but Sartre picked it up and spread it<br>
around more contemporaneously.&gt;<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;Strange that the very process that was responsible for the genius<br>
inside of Feynman's head was what led him to confirm in physical reality<br>
what these philosophers had been saying a generation before.&gt;<br>
<p>
Secondly, and very closely related to this, we broached the timeless topic<br>
of the correlation between objective reality (physical spaces) and<br>
subjective reality (mental spaces of mathematical semantics).  A sample<br>
follows:<br>
<p>
Omega wrote 2/1/97 in "Von Neumann's Mistake": &lt;Of course, this just begs<br>
the question of the priority of, and relation between, mental spaces and<br>
physical spaces.  One of the biggest unanswered questions in the philosophy<br>
of science is the uncanny correlation physical reality and the totally<br>
arcane branches of mathematics that sometimes get discovered centuries<br>
before they are shown to have any relationship to physical reality.&gt;<br>
<p>
The very short answer to these links, is that the universe is<br>
self-consistent.  As Kant put it in the chapter 'Analytic of Concepts' of<br>
"Critique of Pure Reason":  "The conditions *a priori* of any possible<br>
experience in general are at the same time conditions of the possibility of<br>
any objects of our experience."<br>
<p>
The longer answer begins with what must be true for self-consistency to be<br>
a property of the universe we know.  We are purposeful, meaningful beings;<br>
purpose and meaning cannot sneak into the universe, they precede us.  No<br>
existent region is not imbued with purpose, the universe is whole and<br>
open-ended.  If any speck of the universe is physically random, then it all<br>
is, and no intelligibility can arise.<br>
<p>
Those who believe the universe is random activity, purposeless and<br>
meaningless, are in a Fourier space (in your terms) turned away from truth.<br>
 They have nothing meaningful to say in a meaningless universe.  They are<br>
not serious, only wastefully playful, in a purposeless universe.  They are<br>
barbaric, in that only might can ever be right in such a universe.  I agree<br>
with Boethius in "The Consolation of Philosophy" where he concludes that<br>
they "not only cease to be powerful, but cease to be at all.... cease to<br>
exist themselves."  Those who deify chance do not have absolute, complete,<br>
unqualified existence.<br>
<p>
I am saying that the concepts of randomness and probability are virtually<br>
synonymous with ignorance.  They are of an epistemological order, not an<br>
ontological order.  The evolutionary growth of intelligence is measured by<br>
a steady decline in aimless behavior, and a steady increase in coherently<br>
purposeful behavior.  Individuals drifting through life, or harboring<br>
unresolved conflicting purposes, are not as intelligent as those who<br>
doggedly pursue the truth, whether narrowly or broadly.  Intentionality is<br>
how we tap into the purpose that imbues the universe and gives rise to our<br>
semantically meaningful concepts, such as mathematics.  The intentional<br>
movements of our bodies in relation to ourselves, our environment, and to<br>
others taps into the design inherent in the universe.  Semantically<br>
meaningful information arises from the functional couplings with others,<br>
produced by mutual intentions within a co-evolving environment.<br>
<p>
We try very hard to statistically fit our mathematical symbols to reality,<br>
but we cannot logically infer a fit, induction must be used not deduction. <br>
The centrality of metaphors (and metonymy) to our semantically meaningful<br>
exchanges is because we must use them when our symbols don't match a<br>
reality which is simply too rich and fine-grained for our symbols to<br>
closely approach.<br>
<p>
Symmetrical translations of spacetime arising from our bodily behavior lie<br>
at the foundation of our semantics; the priority of relations consists in a<br>
metaphorical mapping from physical space to mental space.  Whatever<br>
statistical fit our mathematics has with physical reality is traced back to<br>
this.  Giambattista Vico in "New Science" (1744), put forth as an axiom the<br>
"universal principle of etymology in all languages:  words are carried over<br>
from bodies and from the properties of bodies to signify the institutions<br>
of the mind and spirit."  This is now the foundation of modern cognitive<br>
psychology (see George Lakoff, Ruth Millikan, Gerald Edelman, etc.).<br>
<p>
Since our bodies move according to our intentions, which are formed within<br>
our evolutionarily preferred value patterns, the linkages between<br>
mathematical concepts, emotions, meaning, design, and aesthetics are<br>
strong. Information specifying our coordinative relations amongst our<br>
constituent parts and between ourselves and our environment is of high<br>
order meaning to us.  Such meaning is entirely contextual, specific to the<br>
task before us.  The movements of the body are inseparable from the<br>
thoughts of the mind.  The formation of our language itself depends on our<br>
behavior.  As we behave in specialized ways, our language and knowledge,<br>
our thinking itself, branches away from each other; we think in different<br>
Fourier spaces because we behave in different Fourier spaces.  Mathematical<br>
semantic technology and tautologies are in mental space alone; mathematics<br>
is essentially the study of stable relations among stable or invariant<br>
mental objects.  That mathematics correlates at all to physical space is<br>
because the universe is self-consistent, we pick up valuable concepts from<br>
physical space and intentionally reapply them to it.<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;And the pathways between the varying [Fourier] spaces could well<br>
have varying degrees of constriction/resistance.  Strange, how in the<br>
purely abstract realm of memetics and cognitive process, that this gives us<br>
such a remarkably strong basis for applying the metaphors of fluid dynamics<br>
in such a meaningful way.&gt;<br>
<p>
It is very productive to think of patterns of thought in terms of river<br>
channels, with "constriction/resistance" reflected in their curves, falls,<br>
shallows, currents, floods, etc.  The physiology of<br>
"constriction/resistance" is what I was describing in my examples of<br>
preferred evolutionary branches of ontogeny, preferred protein folding<br>
spaces, preferred protein design spaces, preferred mental activity<br>
patterns, etc.  Virtually everywhere you turn in the biological sciences,<br>
preferred physical structures and preferred dynamic patterns turn up; not<br>
randomness, but design.  The most highly adaptive dynamic structures, such<br>
as our brains and immune systems, are most aptly described with liquid<br>
realm metaphors, because the biophysical "constriction/resistance"<br>
parameters force them to "flow" in between chaotic and ordered dynamic<br>
patterns.<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;I find it amazing that so few of those interested in uploads are<br>
paying any attention to this lack of analog in proposed upload schemes.  <br>
Digital is nice, but this business of waveform families and their associate<br>
spaces is not in any way insignificant.&gt;<br>
<p>
This "learned ignorance" touches on the "free will vs. group-think" thread.<br>
 The unexamined metaphysical presuppositions of the age are greatly<br>
inhibitory to creative breakthroughs in scientific knowledge or humanistic<br>
wisdom.  The pervasive digital/computer metaphor has made many otherwise<br>
intelligent individuals appear to be "bit-drunk."  I believe progress would<br>
gain the fast track again when excitement over the latest "toy" wanes,<br>
computers are taken for granted, and the search for novelty leads back to<br>
the ever-fertile fields of analog devices.  I weary of the "Digital Age"<br>
media-hype already, I'll announce (perhaps prematurely) the dawn of, what<br>
else, the "Post-Digital Age."<br>
<p>
We also must keep in mind, that meaning arises from the movements of the<br>
body as it functionally couples with others against the background of the<br>
external environment.  What forms of bodies uploads will inhabit, will<br>
determine what meanings will arise within them.  Certainly human meanings<br>
will not arise or be sustained in non-human bodies.<br>
<p>
Omega wrote 2/1/97 in "Von Neumann's Mistake": &lt;With this comes an<br>
understanding that a generalized math capable of reconciling all the<br>
Fourier spaces within reality is going to require a system that combines<br>
continuous differential equations with fractals and other forms of discrete<br>
math into a seamless whole.&gt;<br>
<p>
Such a system would include difference equations, among other forms of<br>
discrete math, and would require quite novel philosophical underpinnings to<br>
seamlessly conjoin them all.  Metaphysically, we would do well to jettison<br>
the assumption that the universe is isotropic, assume that the Planck and<br>
gravitational constants are only locally constant (if not downright<br>
variable), and develop a physical explanation that would shore up the<br>
legitimacy of Einstein's assumption of a constant light speed.  Scientific<br>
statements we make about reality should be radically local in their scope,<br>
not universal, in keeping with the metaphysical presupposition of discrete<br>
Fourier spaces with analog connections across boundaries.<br>
