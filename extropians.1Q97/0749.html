An advantage to 900,000 ton rocks. You're not going to be launching them<br>
from the moon in the near future. <br>
<p>
However, the supposed advantage is rather dubious. As you keep pointing<br>
out, most Earth targets are on the surface, so you really want to put the<br>
energy of the incoming rock into as large an area as possible on the<br>
surface, not waste it digging up the ground. <br>
<p>

Yeah, if you could make it more aerodynamic then it would presumably do<br>
better than his figures (I'd be interested to know just how effective this<br>
might be, if anyone can do the calculations). But you're increasing your<br>
cost again. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; in higher</i><br>

<p>
But this is the basic problem. You can't launch them in large enough<br>
quantities to make a difference. You'd need several weeks to launch<br>
900,000 tons of rocks. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Apparently its not, as a rock makes a deeper hole, and since earth</i><br>

<p>
Aren't you contradicting yourself here?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the atmospheric shock</i><br>
<i>&gt; waves on earth are the kicker, so the damage radius is greater on earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; than on the moon.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but that's not a big concern when the amount of destructive energy<br>
that the Earth forces can put into your colony is hundreds or thousands of<br>
times larger than you can put into the Earth. We can afford to waste a lot<br>
because the targets are smaller and we have much more to begin with. <br>
