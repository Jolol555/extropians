<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "A few people, a very few people, now know that there is an absolute</i><br>

<i>&gt; demand creativity and also provocation."</i><br>
<p>
I'd quibble over words here, though I basically agree.  Learning neural <br>
nets demand _feedback_.  Creativity is an artifact, not a neccesity.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; and, more:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "... These systems are patterning systems.  They make and use patterns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From an analysis of the behavior and potential behavior in such system we</i><br>
<i>&gt; can get a very clear idea of the nature of creativity.  All at once the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mystique of creativity falls away. We can see how creativity works. We can</i><br>
<i>&gt; also see how we might devise techniques to increase the possibility of new</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas. In a sense we come to look at the "logic" of creativity. ... No leap</i><br>
<i>&gt; of faith or mystical acceptance is required. There is no mysterious black</i><br>
<i>&gt; box labeled, 'in here it all happens.'"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Learning how to be creative requires an ability to train thought patterns to</i><br>
<i>&gt; take new routes. {snip}</i><br>
<p>
That's part of it.  Letting one's train of thought jump the tracks is merely<br>
daydreaming or smoking dope.  Anyone can do that.  The essential part of <br>
creativity is doing something with that meandering thought; getting it to<br>
alight on another - perhaps new - track.<br>
<p>
The extreme of letting one's thoughts take new routes is insanity. ( Many<br>
notable artists and musicians are known to strayed over the edge. )  The<br>
trick is to let the thoughts loose, but not too loose.<br>
<p>
I digress for a moment...<br>
<p>
Chris Langton did a paper on cellular automata, in which he describes<br>
the measurement of information flow in a CA, which he measured with what<br>
he called the Lambda parameter.  When Lambda was zero or close to it,<br>
the CAs were static.  At a higher level - about .2 - the CAs were periodic.<br>
Anything over about .3 resulted in chaos.  But just on the edge between <br>
the two, at about .270, there was a region of complexity that was stable<br>
but not periodic. ( J.H.Conway's Life was .273 )<br>
<p>
...end of digression.<br>
<p>
Both human thought and CAs seem to have regions of periodicity and excess<br>
activity with a 'sweet spot' somewhere between.<br>
<p>
I suggest that human creativity might be describable in a similar space<br>
and measurable by a similar parameter.  Any thoughts on this?<br>
