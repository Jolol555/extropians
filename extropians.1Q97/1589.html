Joy Williams asks, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are you implying that an interest in mathematics leads to a </i><br>
<i>&gt; destruction of sexual identity if you are female?  </i><br>
<p>
Not at all.  It's not a question of "being interested".  Jennifer was <br>
interested in many things, particularly philosophy, which is why she <br>
was attracted to me.  If she had also been interested in math, fine.  <br>
No problem.  <br>
<p>
Let me try to explain what is involved in this.  Quoting from a <br>
biographical sketch of Newton by George F. Simmons, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When asked how he made his discoveries, he said, "I keep </i><br>
<i>&gt; the subject constantly before me and wait till the first dawnings </i><br>
<i>&gt; open little by little into the full light."   This sounds simple enough, </i><br>
<i>&gt; but everyone with experience in science or mathematics knows </i><br>
<i>&gt; how very difficult it is to hold a problem continuously in mind </i><br>
<i>&gt; for more than a few seconds or a few minutes.  One's attention </i><br>
<i>&gt; flags; the problem repeatedly slips away and repeatedly has to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; dragged back by an effort of will.  From the accounts of witnesses, </i><br>
<i>&gt; Newton seems to have been capable of almost effortless sustained </i><br>
<i>&gt; concentration on his problems for hours and days and weeks, </i><br>
<i>&gt; with even the need for occasional food and sleep scarcely </i><br>
<i>&gt; interrupting the steady squeezing grip of his mind.  </i><br>
<p>
"Dragged back by an effort of will":  I'm not sure anyone who has  <br>
never attempted such things can understand what kind of "effort of will" <br>
is meant here.  Have you ever tried to run a marathon in two hours?  <br>
(or tried to run a marathon at all?)  Have you ever done anything that <br>
required you to make a supreme effort, to call on every last bit of your <br>
strength, to push yourself beyond all limits?  <br>
<p>
Imagine running three marathons every day for thirty years, and you <br>
will have some idea what it takes to be a mathematician at the level of <br>
Newton.  <br>
<p>
And it's not just the effort.  Concentrating on math requires one to use <br>
one's imagination in a peculiar way.  It requires a certain inner stillness; <br>
sex disturbs this stillness.  It requires one to order one's thoughts, <br>
to establish certain relations between visual, auditory, and kinesthetic <br>
thoughts.  <br>
<p>
Now, let me rephrase my original claim:  What if she were as obsessed <br>
with math as Newton was?  She would have to reorganize her mind <br>
at a very fundamental level, and it would change her feminine psyche <br>
into something else.  <br>
<p>
Coming back to Joy's post, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it your opinion somehow that being interested in mathematics turns </i><br>
<i>&gt; you into something non-sexed, or drains you of your attractiveness?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or interferes with your sexuality?  What an odd thing if you do. What </i><br>
<i>&gt; does one thing have to do with another?  </i><br>
<p>
Again, it's not a question of "being interested".  If Jennifer had had an <br>
absolute commitment to mathematics, to the exclusion of everything <br>
else, that would have changed her.  There is an inevitable trade-off.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And er, just what would have her "female Psyche" have been turned </i><br>
<i>&gt; *into*?  A male Psyche?  A non-sexual Psyche?  </i><br>
<p>
For all practical purposes, a non-sexual Psyche.  Newton was celibate.  <br>
He was an alchemist who transmuted his sexuality into something else.  <br>
<p>
Joy, I thought you, if anyone, would understand what I'm getting at <br>
here.  Earlier today you wrote:  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; we are ultimately responsible for what we manifest...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wouldn't minimalize all that you are to just your brain.  You are</i><br>
<i>&gt; comprised of many organs, your body has intelligence, your heart </i><br>
<i>&gt; has intelligence, your cells throughout your body communicate </i><br>
<i>&gt; with each other.  I think the brain is the pinnacle of the intelligence </i><br>
<i>&gt; of your body,  but it is not the only source.  Did you know your heart </i><br>
<i>&gt; has it's own nervous system that interacts with the central nervous </i><br>
<i>&gt; system?  </i><br>
<p>
When I say that concentrating on math for years on end changes <br>
your psyche, and this in turn changes you physically, how can you <br>
of all people disagree?  Our bodies are the manifestations of our minds <br>
and our spirits.  <br>
<p>
