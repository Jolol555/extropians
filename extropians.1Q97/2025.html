<i>&gt; My parents saw I was getting mail from Lucifer.com </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and now they think I'm in league with the devil!</i><br>
<i>&gt; A God-talking preacher friend of thiers outraged me to the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt; obscenity   with a conversation whose sole purpose seemed to be to get me</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt; do what my  parents wanted. </i><br>
<i>&gt; They are threatening to cut off the computer (this computer)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from the internet because they think it is Satanic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I AM NOT JOKING!</i><br>
<i>&gt; The internet is my main source of communication.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Losing it would EXTREMELY limit my Transhuman/Extropian efforts </i><br>
<i>&gt;  which would lessen the length and quality of my life and happiness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been raised to be dependant upon them </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and would have a difficult time claiming my independance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been denied access to and control of my assets.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been threatened with homelessness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I fear for my health and safety.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am sovereign and have declared that publicly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (not that many people would believe me)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and any legal action would be under international jurisdiction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; My life is a mess.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; WHAT CAN I DO?!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

It is unfortunate that your parents feel that they need to control your<br>
life in what philosophy and religion you choose to adopt.  I would suggest<br>
you talk to them, and perhaps try to make them understand that you no<br>
longer see things their way and probably will never again.  Fortunately,<br>
although my parents are fundamentalist and I live with them, they accept<br>
that I have chosen a different way of seeing things then they have.  <br>
<p>
As for the privileges of using the internet being taken away from you and<br>
limiting your growth and efforts, I would suggest that you do not let that<br>
stop you.  I can tell you I was a transhuman before I even heard of them. <br>
I always found my local library useful for increasing my knowledge, and<br>
there is always practical ways of enhancing yourself I would suppose.  It<br>
would be a shame if they did take away your right to be on here, but I<br>
would not let that stop you at all.<br>
<p>
Just a couple of thoughts and suggestions, the other more experienced<br>
members of this list will probably have better suggestions.  <br>
<p>
You should print out the Extropian Princples if you agree with them and<br>
also look at their booklist, some of the ones that introduced me to<br>
Transhumanism in a way were Robotics edited by Marvin Minsky and Mind<br>
Children by Hans Moravec, which btw, I think theres a sequel coming out but<br>
I'm not sure.    <br>
