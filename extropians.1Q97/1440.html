Philosophical nonsense!  You are seeing and experiencing the physical<br>
world.  Just this ordinary everyday experience of the physical world is<br>
what the words 'seeing' and 'experiencing'  refer to; they do *not*<br>
refer to the experience itself, but to what that experience is *of*. (<br>
This is analogous to Eddington's 'two tables' mistake.)<br>
<p>
The old distinction between 'mediate' and 'immediate' serves quite well,<br>
I think.  <br>
<p>
The immediate *substance* of your experience is your visual cortex:<br>
that's what your experience of the physical world is 'made of'.  The<br>
mediate ('intentional')  *object* of your experience is the physical<br>
world (including, of course, the visual cortex experienced as 'lump of<br>
gray stuff'!)<br>
<p>
Actually this business has always intrigued me.  It's very close to<br>
mysticism (in the good sense, in the sense of profound experiences). <br>
There is really nothing particularly mysterious about mysticism in this<br>
sense at all: we are very *obviously* 'all one', the universe is a Great<br>
Big Thing, and we are simply parts of it, which share in its Great Big<br>
Thingness in the same way that a leaf shares in Tree-ness.  And this<br>
part of It that I am just happens to be a part that mirrors, models (or<br>
is a microcosm) of, the whole.<br>
<p>
To put all this another way: my brain (or rather, my brain and nervous<br>
system plus adjuncts) only *looks like* a gray lump, what it *really* is,<br>
is just this very experience I am having right now! (Shades of<br>
Schopenhauer here?)  This isn't 'experience' in the normal everyday<br>
sense, but precisely *mystical* experience, in which there is no<br>
distinction between subject and object.<br>
