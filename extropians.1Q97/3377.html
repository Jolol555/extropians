Why sadness?  You took a post with an intention to locate a printing press<br>
and singled out a visual idea and made it into a scientific debate.  Then<br>
you began attacking values and accusing intent without fully comprehending<br>
the concept. Your blatant comments were based on an area of interest that<br>
you consider yourself to be adept at, but you missed all else.  Rather than<br>
ask questions, your made assumptions and claimed them as facts.<br>

across differently.<br>

<p>
Yes, I can see. I don't believe that anyone was intentionally trying to make<br>
science or you look foolish.<br>
