Hey there,<br>
  found something that might be of interest to anyone that has an<br>
interest in promoting a digital cash "underground".  There's a page<br>
called Nella, and the "Global Village Bank" which work together.  It's<br>
an idea whose time has come, I believe.  Here's the deal.  <br>
<p>
Say I like to design web pages.  Now, I'd like to have someone hmm...<br>
Make a midi file for me or something.  Well, I list myself as a business<br>
in the listing the company has on their page.  Then, someone can hire me<br>
for my services of designing a web page for them.  They'll pay me with<br>
"nella", a virtual currency which is not related to anything in the real<br>
world.  This nella goes into my GVB account.  Then, when I have enough<br>
nella, I can go to someone who can do midi, and hire them for their<br>
services.  Anything that can be transported digitally through the net is<br>
sellable with Nella.  no physical property can be sold.  The page isn't<br>
going to get started until 1000 "businesses" have registered.  I really<br>
want to see a day a real virtual cash system happens, without being<br>
bogged down in the economics of the real world.(I don't know if that's<br>
truly feasible, but hey, one can dream, eh?)  Check it out, and see what<br>
you think...  Maybe we can even do projects as a team or something? <br>
Whatever works.  Anyways, here's the URL...<br>
