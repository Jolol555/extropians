<i>&gt; [SNIP]</i><br>
<p>
Though it is difficult to see out of context, the quote above was a<br>
rhetorical question, but I appreciate your response none the less.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, since we can't step outside ourselves to check words against</i><br>
<i>&gt; reality, when we call something true that means we *conjecture* it to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; true.</i><br>
<p>
So we are saying one thing, but we means something *slightly* different.<br>
This is one of my difficulties with the term truth, by definition it<br>
does not include this element of conjecture or skepticism. By definition<br>
it is absolute, and not particularly questionable. Do you not imagine<br>
that we might come up with a better term for what we are talking about.<br>
One which is a bit more accurate or *true* [to use the term loosely].<br>
The dictionary definition of truth is not entirely consistent with the<br>
manner in which it is being used by science. Would it not make more<br>
sense to create a more accurate word ... and then while doing so,<br>
questioning all the priorities which truth and the new word both entail.<br>
<p>
I like the word conjecture. It is derived from "com" which means<br>
"together", and "jacere" which means "to throw"; to throw together. The<br>
term conjecture seems much more dynamic than that of truth, which seems<br>
extremely static. Perhaps the word "conjection" would be more suitable.<br>
<p>
con-jec-tion n. something thrown together or conjectured in an attempt<br>
to contextually accord with reality.     <br>
<p>
con-jec-tive n. the degree to which a conjection accords with reality<br>
compared to, or relative to, another conjection. adj. when stating that<br>
one conjection is more or less so than another.<br>
<p>
See now, where it sounds silly to talk about arriving at a more true<br>
truth, it is very natural to speak of a more useful or conjective<br>
conjection, e.g., ... <br>
<p>
Newton's truth is not as accurate or useful as Einstein's truth", versus<br>
Newton's conjection is not as accurate or useful as Einstein's<br>
conjection.<br>
<p>
Instead of seeking truth or ultimate truth, we seek metaconjection, a<br>
better conjection than the one we have now.<br>
<p>
Unlike the term true, conjective does not have an opposite, it is<br>
specifically a continuum of degrees. Something can be said to have 0<br>
degrees of or very little conjective, but cannot be said to be<br>
nonconjective, for it is conjective, it is just 0 degrees conjective.<br>
This keeps the emphasis on the greyscale rather on something simply<br>
black or white.<br>
<p>
Conjection is a synthesis and refinement of the terms "truth" and<br>
"theory". Conjective is a response to the true-false dichotomy. Thus<br>
instead of saying that a theory is either true or false, we could say<br>
that a conjection is more or less conjective.<br>
<p>
Where truth is a statement of relation to reality alone, conjective is a<br>
statement of relation to both reality and to other conjections. Thus<br>
conjectively, a conjection is intrinsically open to criticism. Its<br>
degree of conjection will be lessoned if a better conjection is "thrown<br>
together."<br>
<p>
I believe these terms or terms created with similar meaning, would be<br>
more suitable to PCR. <br>
<p>
I don't expect anyone to take this whole conjection/conjective thing too<br>
seriously, but it illustrates a problem and the beginnings of a<br>
solution. For several reasons, some mentioned above, the term "truth" is<br>
not wholly appropriate to our use of it. I believe the term is<br>
inhibitory in one sense due to its bias on a specific modality of<br>
consciousness, and inhibitory in another sense due to its static nature,<br>
and its reference to reality without relation to anything else. <br>
Reality changes, there is no absolute reality, so how could there be an<br>
absolute truth. How can we seek absolute truth, something that is<br>
suppose to accord with reality, when reality itself is not absolute and<br>
unchanging. I believe this problem can be solved by more refined, more<br>
appropriate and thus *useful* terminology.<br>
<p>
Our theoris progress, shouldn't our terminology also?  <br>
<p>
Perhaps the term truth is not yet archaic or obsolete, but I imagine it<br>
will one day be so. It merely requires that enough people find it<br>
neccessary for more *useful* terminology. <br>
<p>
I'm not sure how exactly this relates, call it an intuitive addition.<br>
But I recall someone mentioning once how a surfer can recognize between<br>
twenty or more different kinds of waves, whereas when I look out at the<br>
ocean, I just see big or small waves [I live in the midwest so I don't<br>
see the ocean or waves often]. I guess I'm proposing in a sense that we<br>
begin to differentiate truth by creating more accurate and less loaded<br>
terms for it. Perhaps that wasn't a good metaphor, but heres another one<br>
along the same lines. In the orient [and elsewhere] many people<br>
generally recognize seven different chakras [some esoteric groups<br>
differentiate between many more]. These chakras are intended to<br>
represent states of consciousnes or modalities of consciousness. Compare<br>
this to the three or so that we tend to focus on, rational [cognitive],<br>
irrational [emotive], and non-rational [intuitive]. I think there is a<br>
great deal of room here for some sophistication and greater sensibility.<br>
Hitherto I have only been pushing for more balance between the three we<br>
recognize, enhancing the emotive and intuitive, but then there are still<br>
other modalities yet. They could all "prove" to be useful in some<br>
fashion where science is concerned.   <br>
<p>
If we do not have language for something, we might not even recognize<br>
it. There is a great deal of literature on how our language shapes our<br>
perception of reality. I do not believe arguments of semantics and<br>
semiotics are wasted time. Isn't this one of the key elements of<br>
memetics? <br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
