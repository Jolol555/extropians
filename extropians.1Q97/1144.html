In a message dated 97-01-23 02:06:32 EST, some guy writes<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;  to re-kindle the not-quite- extinguished<br>
 embers of the genius threads.  And suddenly, again we have a nice warm<br>
 bonfire, complete with 'politically correct' flames.  So, I'll give $5.00 to<br>
 the genius who can tell me *why*.  I'm serious. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Because, for one, the words politically correct, at first, were not a jab, a<br>
joke or a poke at people who are trying to whine about their condition, or<br>
get their way, but meant some one who had first done their homework and tried<br>
to make an educated political decision. Which then became a kind of position,<br>
and instead of being thinking, became unthinking.<br>
<p>
Now, for certain individuals, calling someone PC has become a DODGE out of<br>
any tricky corner that someone finds themselves in, without having to explain<br>
or educate your listener as to why you have your theories. You can call them<br>
PC and that should cover it.<br>
<p>
Politically correct as Eli said NOW does apply to certain things, but does<br>
not include searching for reasons or solutions to tricky problems [ the<br>
battle of the sexes being a very tricky problem even more so since everyone<br>
got so damned PC ] it certainly does not refer to Extropians casting about<br>
for solutions, or for intellectual or radical attempts to threaten the status<br>
quo or break tradition.<br>
<p>
Be careful,.  BEING PC used to brand you as unthinking... now it's  using the<br>
PC word as a DEFENSE that may brand you as unthinking.<br>
