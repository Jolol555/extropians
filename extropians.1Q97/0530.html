It's a more accessible book, especially to people educated since the <br>
early '70s, as it uses computing analogies throughout. However, it states <br>
little new, and I have some real problems with some of it's logical <br>
arguments. Not that I think the conclusions are wrong, just that he <br>
trusts too much in the programmers not building assumptions into the <br>
models. The same sort of error (although on a far smaller scale) that <br>
Paul Erlich and the Club of Rome made with their economic models. He's so <br>
sure he's right, he isn't looking to see if the models are subtly biased. <br>
The web-spinning programs are a good example.<br>

Blind Watchmaker still says it better, and is more convincing IMO.<br>
