This reason for emigrating to the US also applies to those of us who stay<br>
here.  The point bears emphasis.  I often encounter tired attempts to justify<br>
statism based on the consent I supposedly imply by not leaving.  In fact, I<br>
stay in the US for many benefits, few of which I attribute to statists.  I<br>
like many aspects of the local culture, appreciate the climate and terrain,<br>
find my friends and family nearby, and speak American fluently.  By staying I<br>
most emphatically do *not* waive my right to resist statist coercion.<br>
<p>
Implied consent, in contrast to express consent,  relies on presumptions<br>
derived from actions, in contrast to speech.  It implies, above all, that you<br>
have not expressly objected to what others would imply you mean.<br>
