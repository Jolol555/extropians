By your reasoning, to get rid of slavery one would have had to convince<br>
people that they would have liked their circumstances substantially<br>
better without owning slaves.  Well, maybe you could have convinced them<br>
of this, maybe not.  But isn't this missing something? Surely the claim<br>
that slavery is evil stands on its own, and likewise re. govt.?<br>
<p>
It just makes no sense at all to argue about how to make something evil<br>
more efficient, whether we've got it at present or not.<br>
