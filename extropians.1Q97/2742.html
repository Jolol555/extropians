Robin Hanson asks:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why do people seem so damn confident of their political</i><br>
<i>&gt;opinions? </i><br>
<p>
He contrasts this confidence with the self-doubt freely expressed in the<br>
"harder" sciences.<br>
<p>
Assuming Robin's observation holds true, I'd posit two causes:<br>
<p>
1) Relative indeterminancy.  The sciences have widely-accepted and effective<br>
means to root out error.  Due to the difficulties of creating double-blind,<br>
replicable experiments, and the profusion of variables, political scientists<br>
have a comparatively harder time defending their claims.  Political thinkers<br>
(especially, in contrast to Robin, amateurs) fall back on force of opinion as<br>
a signal of veracity.<br>
<p>
2) Relative risks of error.  If physicists err in matters of phlogiston or<br>
caloric, they at worst merely slow technical advances.  If politicians err in<br>
matters of public or foreign policy, they put my life, and the lives of my<br>
loved ones, at grave risk.  People thus perhaps hew to strong political<br>
beliefs because the risk of suffering others' errors seems so grave.  Few<br>
people regard the risks of their *own* political error with equal horror,<br>
since they pick their beliefs with an eye to self-interest.  In other words,<br>
if you err in your political beliefs, I could suffer horribly.  If I err,<br>
*you* might suffer horribly but *I* would probably still end up better off<br>
than I would under your erroneous schemes.<br>
<p>
