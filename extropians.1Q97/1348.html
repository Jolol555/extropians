John K Clark,<br>

<i>&gt; First of all I want to make it clear that I'm not defending Von Neumann's</i><br>
<i>&gt; proof, I'll grant you that it's wrong, I'll even grant you it's silly, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; only because the axioms he used were silly. I quote from "The Cosmic Code"</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the late great Heinz R Pagels page 166:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Von Neumann's proof was logically flawless, but as Bell first pointed out,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  one of the assumptions that went into Von Neumann's proof did not apply to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  quantum theory and therefore the proof was irrelevant."</i><br>
<p>
Your depth of historical knowledge in this seems greater than mine so I'll <br>
defer to your analysis of the historical context that lead to von Neumann's<br>
flawed proof; his work, after all, did happen within the context of a subject<br>
that seems to defy reasonableness.   Still I have a couple of lingering <br>
doubts in this area:<br>
<p>
1. Supposedly the proof was shown to be flawed in 1935 by Grete Hermann on<br>
   purely mathematical grounds.  After all, isn't the application of a set<br>
   average to the individual members of a set flawed on purely mathematical<br>
   grounds?  This is my understanding of math, am I mistaken here?<br>
<p>
2. You say that "There would be nothing illogical about a world that worked<br>
   that way" (referring to one that followed von Neumann's proof) but such<br>
   a world is one in which microcausality is hopelessly lost, which for me,<br>
   is about as illogical as we can get.<br>
<p>
With the modern understanding that advanced-action can reduce all of the <br>
puzzling phenomena of quantum physics down to one concise deterministic <br>
explanation, I would say that it's all water under the bridge, except for<br>
the fact that the Copenhagen interpretation (produced by Bohr and cast <br>
in concrete ever since von Neumann produced his "proof") has spawned <br>
immense quantities of reckless quantum mysticism within our culture;<br>
something I see as a real and growing problem.  <br>

P.S. I'll get back to the free-will subject tomorrow, as our definitions
     are definitely in conflict.  My mention of political correctness in
     this case is nothing personal.  On the contrary, I posit it as a
     further example of how endemic and hidden political correctness is
     within the human condition.
