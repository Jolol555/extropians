With all this talk about augmenting our bodies and selves through technology, <br>
let's not forget to use the resources that our brains and bodies already have <br>
built in, as features, which we can expand upon through discipline and <br>
practice.  <br>
<p>
Our muscles can become stronger and more versatile through intelligent use (I <br>
can provide details of some of the work I'm doing with my muscles later.<br>
<p>
All of our senses can become several times stronger simply through paying more <br>
focused attention to sensory information.  I also like to turn my music and <br>
the television way down to the level where I can still hear it well enough to <br>
enjoy it, and as I listen to it on that level for a few minutes, it starts <br>
seeming very loud indeed, so I turn it down a little until it is not so loud, <br>
and I keep doing this until the signal is very faint, but I'm still picking it <br>
up loud and clear.  <br>
<p>
I also like to improve my senses by walking or running around outside, <br>
wandering around the park and hiking in the mountains.  I have disciplined <br>
myself to maintain a sharp awareness of my environment, and I am becoming more <br>
able to consciously process a tremendous amount of sensory information and <br>
link it to my memories and knowledge.  When I get really intense, a minute can <br>
seem like several hours and I can learn a year's worth of material in a day.<br>
<p>
All of this with just my biological body and mind.  The systems we already <br>
have can do far more than we've realized yet.  Good martial artists and yogis <br>
have known this for thousands of years.<br>
<p>
My advice is to use *everything* you have available to you, including the <br>
resources of your bodymind and the technological creations of other bodyminds, <br>
including the plants and animals in life -- evolution has come up with some <br>
pretty ingenious solutions to difficult problems (look at the elaborate and <br>
technologically advanced termite Civilizations).  We can learn from all the <br>
world around us and extract lessons to apply to our lives.<br>
<p>
Find usefulness in everything.<br>
