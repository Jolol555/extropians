Hi, it seems there is a little confusion going on over the exact definition<br>
of "meaning" here (a broad term, as with most high-level concept words in<br>
English).  "Meaning" can refer to information content (the "meaning" of the<br>
book) or it can refer to purpose (the "meaning" of a religion).  <br>
<p>
Obviously soap operas have meaning in the sense of information content, but<br>
to most of the members of this list, little or no meaning in the sense of<br>
purpose.  The sense of meaning in this discussion (the Meaning of Life)<br>
obviously is the purpose one and "meaning is value" should be pretty<br>
accurate.<br>
