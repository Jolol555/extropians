It seems we're close to agreement. I don't know that I can talk for<br>
everyone, but my sense is that in general it's easier to learn "Don't do<br>
that while you're upset." than it is "Don't let it bother you". However, I'm<br>
with you on the deeper point: Although I think the latter may be more<br>
difficult, certainly it's more rewarding. Once you've achieved a high level<br>
of control over your thinking and the feeling it produces, you don't have to<br>
battle with yourself everytime someone says something potentially upsetting.<br>
