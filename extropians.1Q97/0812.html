<i>&gt; I used to play the "I'm  right and you're wrong!" game quite vigorously, </i><br>
<i>&gt; having long drawn-out arguments with people.  These exchanges were lots</i><br>
<i>&gt; of fun for me, but it was upsetting to lots of other people, who didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; enjoy talking to me very much because I would always draw them into an</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument.  I also realized that the person I was arguing with was trying</i><br>
<i>&gt; to establish their point just as hard as I was trying to establish mine.</i><br>
<p>
There are lots of dangerous, evil, counterproductive memes floating<br>
around in our society, and the fact that even Extropians can fall prey<br>
to them is a testament to their tenacity.  Let me try to find some:<br>
<p>
- "Argument is a zero-sum contest"<br>
<p>
  This meme is present in your paragraph above.  The purpose of<br>
  argument isn't "to prove yourself right and the other guy wrong";<br>
  such a pursuit is bound to result in hostility.  The purpose is<br>
  to find the truth.  One way to do that is to have each participant<br>
  take a position and argue for it, and see whose argument best<br>
  stands up to criticism.  But if you interpret that result as a<br>
  "win" for the person who happened to take that position and a<br>
  "loss" for the others, you'll naturally come to resent the game<br>
  because you often lose.  Sometimes all points hold up well;<br>
  sometimes none do; sometimes one stands out.  But whatever the<br>
  result, everyone wins if their purpose is to find the truth.<br>
  I consider it a great (albeit rare:) joy when I am proved wrong.<br>
<p>
- "You shouldn't offend people"<br>
<p>
  This is the dangerous meme I've been trying to fight in this<br>
  thread.  It's dangerous because it supresses open discussion and<br>
  free argument, and because it reinforces another bad meme:<br>
<p>
- "People can be hurt by words"<br>
<p>
  The most dangerous one of all.  This is the very denial of<br>
  reason.  It is the insulting idea that minds are not capable of<br>
  rational judgment about emotionally charged ideas.  It is a<br>
  typical instance of Hofstaedter's "opressor/victim" type meme,<br>
  and is as tenacious as others of that type.  I, for one, refuse<br>
  to be a victim of words, and I will not insult others by<br>
  paternalistically "protecting" them from my words or others.<br>
