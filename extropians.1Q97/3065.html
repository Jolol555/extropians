From: "J. de Lyser" &lt;gd33463@glo.be&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; Wouldn't it be possible (theoretically) and maybe ethically more acceptable</i><br>
<i>&gt; to: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A) Make sure a clone doesn't develop a brain BEFORE fertilization, by</i><br>
<i>&gt; taking out certain genes ?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think we know enough about the human genome to do this.  As was<br>
mentioned, you don't want to remove the whole brain, just the "higher level"<br>
parts that (we hope) are necessary for consciousness.  The fear that we<br>
may somehow be creating a person who experiences terrible suffering from<br>
our manipulations may be enough to retard experiments along these lines.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; B) Grow just an arm or body part from specialized tissue cells ?</i><br>
<p>
Cloning technology by itself will not accomplish this.  Conceivably we<br>
could eventually learn to rip a proto-arm off a cloned embryo, hook it<br>
up to a tiny little blood supply, and grow an arm, without growing the<br>
rest of the body.  It's not clear that this would work, though.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ofcourse growing a clone without a brain, cutting off his leg and then</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaving it? alive for future spare parts would also seem very unethical.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even brainless clones should have some rights (animal rights?)</i><br>
<p>
The issue of the rights of animals, brainless humans, and small children<br>
is a difficult one.  At one extreme we can say that they are owned<br>
creatures, and their masters can do whatever they wish with them.<br>
That is the more pragmatic view as well, because of the difficulty of<br>
observing mistreatment without having a surveillance state in place.<br>
At the other extreme is the view that people have the right and duty<br>
to prevent mistreatment of helpless creatures even on other people's<br>
property.  A moderate position would provide some kind of partial rights<br>
in these cases, with enforcement limited to when infractions become<br>
externally visible.  That is basically what we have today, although the<br>
details will not be to everyone's taste.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and about using animals for donor organs:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Shouldn't i be the one left to decide what i do with my genes to my animals</i><br>
<i>&gt; ? (as long as i don't cause that animal to suffer) In the Netherlands a</i><br>
<i>&gt; court ruled a bull had to be 'terminated' last year, because it was given a</i><br>
<i>&gt; human gene (which would increase milk production i believe). In the end</i><br>
<i>&gt; they just sterilized it and let it live. </i><br>
<p>
The fear about mixing animal and human cells is the possibility of<br>
introducing new diseases, encouraging germs to cross species lines.<br>
This is one of those cases where a pure property-rights view may not<br>
be adequate to prevent massive epidemics.  It is similar to the case of<br>
quarantining someone who has an infectious disease, one of the classic<br>
"hard cases" of libertarianism.<br>
