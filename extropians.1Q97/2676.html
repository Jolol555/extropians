I agree it is unrealistic in our present context to remove the concept<br>
of "THE TRUTH". I'm not particulary convinced this would be so for more<br>
highly developed entities. But in any case, by attempting to justify the<br>
extreme stance I have been taking, I hope I have illustrated some points<br>
where science is currently lacking, where some shifts in focus and<br>
priority might prove of monumental benefit. I just ran across the<br>
following quote in this months issue of WIRED. Though WIRED appears to<br>
me to be a trendy corporate oriented magazine, the following quote<br>
seemed serendipitously relevant:    <br>
<p>
"If you watch the curve of science and everything we know, it shoots up<br>
like a rocket. We're on this rocket and we're going perfectly vertical<br>
into the stars. But the emotional intelligence of humankind is equally<br>
if not more important than our intellectual intelligence. We're just as<br>
emotionally illiterate as we were 5,000 years ago; so emotionally our<br>
line is completely horizontal. The problem is the horizontal and the<br>
vertical are getting farther and farther apart. And as these things grow<br>
apart, there's going to be some kind of consequence of that." <br>
<p>
--George Lucas, from interview in Febuary 1997 issue of WIRED magazine<br>
<p>
With that said, I'm going to take a break, digest some criticism,<br>
consume more information, and incubate some ideas. Thank you for your<br>
discourse.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
