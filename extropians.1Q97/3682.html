Sarah made three statements; which isn't accurate?  I know very few<br>
people who have even heard of Extropianism.  If I give a short<br>
description they assume it's a fringe group of nuts.  I tried that<br>
experiment once.<br>

I still doubt the mass viability of Extropianism in a world with a<br>
tenuous grasp of the Enlightenment.<br>
