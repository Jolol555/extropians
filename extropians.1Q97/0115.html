By Bruce N. Ames<br>
<p>
In which the author, Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry,<br>
University of California, Berkeley, examines science as a<br>
spontaneously ordered system, not a centrally planned one. Professor<br>
Ames discusses the market as another spontaneous order which has<br>
evolved from a framework of individual freedom, non-coercion,<br>
voluntary exchange between people and private property.<br>
