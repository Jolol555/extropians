I had just given up on finding the missing afarensis predator, when someone<br>
reminded me of an Australopithicene skull with holes in it, which suggested<br>
a cat like ancestor. It gave me new motivation to find this 'Acinonyx<br>
Anonymous' :-) As i think it's important to know what the capabilities of<br>
this predator were, as it was being compared to Lions Cheetahs and other<br>
modern maneaters. Where Afarensis was being portrayed as a defenseless 'chimp'. <br>
<p>
I've finished a night of searching data on the possibility of this species<br>
of Acinonyx which might have been this 'missing predator'. Everywhere i<br>
looked for the big cats, (the zoologist) data showed that they only<br>
developed 3mln years ago. A paleontologist suggested a Leopard !(a panthera<br>
species which could have impossibly been there around lucys time !) All<br>
other primate data resources mentioned predators, but the serious ones<br>
without identifying those predators, the less serious ones mistook the early<br>
(civet)hyeanids for modern hyeanas or (like John and michael) suggested<br>
lions, cheetah etc. <br>
<p>
I've been told that the problem seems to be the fossil record. The same<br>
little gap in the record that is blurring the origin of man, seems to be<br>
blurring that of a lot of ancestors of other species. Their must have been a<br>
civet like large cat around that could have hunted Australopitheces, but the<br>
data on what it's characteristics were runs pretty scarce. (i'm sure the<br>
beast has a name, but if i couldn't even find the name of it, i'm sure other<br>
details about it will be even harder to find,... if such data exists.) What<br>
concerned me most though is that the paleontologist data i read (+ the one i<br>
communicated with!) didn't even know the name of the creature, i was<br>
dumbfounded about the ease with which they desribed it as a 'leopard' or a<br>
'lion', assuming it had the characteristics of a modern big cat, being not<br>
one or two million years off, but two or three !<br>
<p>
The zoology data on the other hand refers to the early cats and other<br>
predators as being in a transitional phase. It shows a possible ancestor to<br>
Acinonyx (older than 3 million years ago) as being more alike to the civet<br>
(hyeana/cat) ancestor than to a modern lion.<br>
<p>
In any case, there probably was a large predator, who knows, maybe even one<br>
with the physical capabilities that come close to those of a modern lion or<br>
leopard. It is feasible as some pre-fatalis Smilodon may have come close to<br>
those capabilities as well. Point is that there is no real data, so<br>
basically there is:<br>
<p>
-a small chance this african big proto-cat was just as big (bigger seems to<br>
be unrealistic), but just as stupid as the smilodon species (more stupid<br>
seems also unrealistic)    <br>
<p>
-a slightly bigger chance this cat was just as big, but slightly smarter.<br>
<p>
-a fairly big chance this cat was slightly smaller, but also slightly smarter<br>
<p>
So what we have is a transitional (civet to cat) big predator, about the<br>
size of a cheetah, with the brains slightly larger than that of smilodon<br>
(the most stupid cat to ever roam the earth) When John Clarke compares<br>
Afarensis to a chimp, he is forgetting that Afarensis was very likely to be<br>
the most intelligent species that existed at its time. <br>
<p>
At least i have tried to establish somewhat of a profile on this possible<br>
predator, i hope that it's appreciated compared to the generalizations made<br>
between prehistoric predators and modern maneaters on one hand, and<br>
Afarensis and chimps on the other.  <br>
<p>
What kind of risk could this predator have posed to afarensis ? (this is<br>
where i'm going to use some comparison, but not like John and Michael did,<br>
placing modern cheetahs and afarensis in the same example!) <br>

<i>&gt; Vacationers kill mountain lion</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   DOS RIOS, Calif., Aug. 16 (UPI) -- Two couples vacationing in a remote cabin</i><br>
<i>&gt;in northern California told Fish and Game wardens Tuesday they had killed a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mountain lion that attacked their dog and then one of the women.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Fish and Game Department spokesman Brian Hunter said the four people were</i><br>
<i>&gt;awakened about 4:30 a.m. by a commotion outside the cabin. They went</i><br>
outside and<br>
<i>&gt;found their large collie fighting with a lion. The lion ran under the cabin and</i><br>
<i>&gt;the dog ran off.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The people told Fish and Game they picked up a shovel, a hatchet and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;kitchen knife and tried to scare the animal out from under the cabin. While the</i><br>
<i>&gt;lion stayed put, the couples started a fire and were standing near it when the</i><br>
<i>&gt;lion ran out from beneath the cabin and attacked one of the women. The rest of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the people jumped on the cat and when the battle was over, the lion lay</i><br>
dead and<br>
<i>&gt;one of the men had had a thumb bitten off.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The couples had to hike a mile, cross a river and use a four-wheel drive</i><br>
<i>&gt;vehicle to get to the nearest hospital at Willits. They were treated for mostly</i><br>
<i>&gt;minor injuries, but the amputated thumb could not be reattached.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The body of the lion, a 50-60 pound female, was taken to Sacramento for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;necropsy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The incident happened in Mendocino County, which has one of the highest</i><br>
<i>&gt;densities of mountain lions in California because of the abundance of deer and</i><br>
<i>&gt;other prey.</i><br>

<p>
This example shows two human couples against a young female lion. although<br>
it may not have ended similar in the case of an adult male lion against four<br>
humans, it's a perfect example of group protection, and shows that our<br>
species is agressive. Given the proper human numbers an adult male lion<br>
would think twice about attacking this group of humans. Lions by the way<br>
(correction to my earlier posts) do NOT hunt in packs, they live in packs,<br>
but hunt alone. (Lions are also not called a 'pack', i think)<br>

<i>&gt;***** How chimpanzees react to predators *******************************</i><br>
In fact, predation is not much of a problem overall for chimps, which might<br>
seem odd until you look at what you face when you face a chimp.What you face<br>
is not. just a chimp, but a group of chimps. A group of strong, howling,<br>
stick and/or rock throwing gang of vicious little hominoids. They kill<br>
baboons and leopard cubs (with leopard-mommy present) with no more armament<br>
or natural ability than australopithecines had. In fact, even lone chimps<br>
have been seen sleeping overnight on the ground in areas frequented by<br>
leopards, which further suggests that they don't have much trouble with such<br>
predators. What we see when we look at predation on chimpanzees, those<br>
animals so similar in size and intelligence to our early ancestors, is that<br>
they have more severe problems (ie. they get killed) with leopards in more<br>
heavily forested areas. In more open wooded savannah they show little<br>
concern with leopards. Perhaps Adrian Kortlandt's experiments during the<br>
1960s would give us a clue as to why this is: During the 1960s Dr.<br>
Kortlandt, a Dutch researcher, did a number of experiments with wild<br>
chimpanzees in natural populations in Africa. One of these was to see how<br>
different populations of chimps react to predators. To do this, he used a<br>
stuffed leopard dummy with electrically moveable head and tail. A baby<br>
chimpanzee doll was placed in the leopard's front paws and the dummy was<br>
placed where it would been countered by mixed groups of chimpanzees,<br>
including females with young, in all the experiments. Several populations of<br>
chimpanzees were sotested several times, including groups in two different<br>
jungle areas,and a group of savannah woodland chimpanzees. All the chimp<br>
groups reacted by picking up sticks as clubs, breaking small trees and<br>
treelimbs to use as clubs, and throwing these at the leopard dummy. An<br>
interesting difference emerged between the jungle chimps and thesavannah<br>
chimps. The jungle chimps, while aggressive toward theleopard, were<br>
uncoordinated in their attacks and when throwing objects,never actually hit<br>
the leopard. Dr. Kortlandt observed:"The results with savannah chimpanzees,<br>
however, were quite different. They grabbed the largest of the available<br>
clubs, which was 2.10 m long,and they tore down small trees of about the<br>
same length; they slashed viciously at the leopard with these. With the aid<br>
of the film we made, we could measure impact velocities of approximately 90<br>
km/h, which would have been sufficient to break the back of a live leopard.<br>
In addition, there was teamwork in evidence during these attacks, again in<br>
contrast to what we observed in the jungle chimpanzees. During the final<br>
attack the dummy was encircled by five chimpanzees, while two others stood<br>
in readiness at some distance, in case they should be needed. Then the<br>
leader grabbed the tail of the leopard and ran away, tossing the predator so<br>
that the head flew from the body."With that, the enemy was considered 'dead'.<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;"A side effect of the experiment was the observation that the savannah</i><br>
chimpanzees more often walked erect than do the jungle chimpanzees.<br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
--&gt; then there's some examples of chimps boasting (screaming) at lions and<br>
more stick throwing at leopards. &lt;--<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then there was that leopard den. A band of chimps went over to aleopard den</i><br>
(sounds like "a gorilla walked into a bar..."), well, they really did (if I<br>
remember the time and place correctly it was at Mahalein 1982) and started<br>
screaming up a storm outside the den. This chimpgroup included not only<br>
adult males, but also females and young. From the sounds inside, the<br>
researchers observing this determined the mother leopard was inside at the<br>
time (but they didn't crawl in and check forsome reason ;-). A couple of<br>
male chimps did, however, and dragged out one of the leopard's babies and<br>
beat it to death. Chimpanzees are not so afraid of large cats as we might<br>
reasonably suppose them to be. (That's understatement, in case you<br>
don'trecognize it.)<br>
-    -      -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -    -    -     -<br>
<p>
I think this example takes care of the 'defenseless' chimp myth ?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
If chimps can handle modern big cats, it seems very logical that afarensis<br>
and other hominids were able to handle more primitive versions of those cats<br>
in quite similar, maybe even more effective ways. Even if afarensis was LESS<br>
intelligent than modern chimps. (which i don't assume 48-46 chromosomes<br>
etc.., but nothing is impossible..)<br>
<p>
If a chimp can do this to a leopard, Imagine what afarensis could do to<br>
Acinonyx or a fox sized proto hyeanid ! <br>
<p>
<p>
to summon up:<br>
<p>
Afarensis lived 3.7 - 2.8 million years ago, (data varies, from 5-2 million yrs)<br>
Acinonyx started to appear 3 mln years ago.<br>
<p>
Proto hyenids (desc from civet) in this period were fox sized and very<br>
probably still solitary hunters.<br>
Smilodon and dog-bear species didn't live in africa.<br>
<p>
That's 200.000 yrs of possible conflict between an afarensis who is not the<br>
helpless chimp he is portrayed to be, and who at this time had the<br>
intellignce large enough to become homo habilis in 200.000 yrs, mathed with<br>
a species of Acinonyx, a most likely cheetah sized cat, who very probably<br>
didn't match ANY of our modern big cats in intelligence. <br>
<p>
Only AFTER homo habilis started to appear (who used tools, spears, hand axes<br>
etc) came the genera of Panthera: Atrox (pre-lions), Leopards and Tigers. <br>
<p>
Hope this organized/cleared things up a little, at least it was my first<br>
real posting of volume :-)<br>
