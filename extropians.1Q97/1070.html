Uh... that must be one hell of a fast jet. The velocity is less <br>
important (unless you use photonic jets). The height is. A high building <br>
(100 m?) is sufficent already. Hvor mange ar klokka? Matterenergy imposes <br>
curvature on spacetime. Vatch de Keplerelementen to obtejn se curvattsher. <br>
If you can _feel_ the gradient tugging, you're in trouble. (Ready, are you <br>
ready, for roasted  spaghetti?)<br>

<p>
What's wrong with that? A point is a point is a point. Quoth Archimedes.<br>
Give me a reference point, and I'll synch all clocks globally.<br>
 <br>

<p>
No matter where. The one spot requiring less coordinate tranformations <br>
(over gadget population). Currently, we are geocentric. In a few decades, we <br>
better turn heliocentric. In a few hundred years? Use the galactic core, <br>
pulsars for anchor points. And then? Ask me a few MYrs later. Provided, <br>
we don't turn spacetime designer aesthetes first.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; sun, the sun is whirling off into space; and I don't even want to</i><br>

<p>
The space per se does nothing. No matter, no timespace. No timespace? Doesn't<br>
matter.<br>
 <br>

Life's not a constant. What's true today ain't necessarily true tomorrow. <br>
Why did the HAM buy the GPS receiver? He synched her, and she cropp'd.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; acceptable for keeping schedules and business meetings in New York while</i><br>

<i>&gt; precision of atomic clocks, it starts to matter.</i><br>
<p>
The clock is just a tool. A demand was there, so they were invented. For <br>
some tasks a kitchen timer will do. For some, it won't.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Really, I don't see a purpose for a new calendar or timing system.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean, sure, you can call the measuring system outdated, but you're</i><br>

<p>
That's not logical, Jim. What do you use now? Your quartz oscillator. I <br>
use my quartz clock, periodically resynched via the atomic clock in <br>
Mainflingen. Does it compensate for signal propagation delay? Nope. Does it <br>
compensate for spacetime curvature? Nope. (GPS does) So if I need ultimative <br>
precision, I use my Garmin 25 XL OEM board (better use Sirf's  <br>
board/chipset now), which gives me atomic clock precision (well, almost.  <br>
A +- 1us output), for a pocket money equivalent. Thinks about your future <br>
appetites. You'll need that precision, and more. Unique object time stamps. <br>
Distribution of the global clock. You spouse's birthday. Whatever.<br>
