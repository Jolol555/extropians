The aquatic ape evolutionary theory may be one among many to explain <br>
bipedalism, but its significance goes beyond that.  It is the first <br>
attempt at a rational hypothesis to explain why women's reproductive <br>
anatomy underwent the change to a full dorsal vagina.  Many <br>
evolutionary biologists have stated that the reproductive change was <br>
hitherto ignored or considered irrelevant, but such a drastic change <br>
would have probably been brought about by a significant change in the <br>
circumstances under which the sex act was conducted.  They point to <br>
the physical similarities of the female genitals of other aquatic <br>
mammals, certain characteristics of which are not paralleled in <br>
land-based primates.  The modern woman's body seems to have evolved <br>
into a combination of the characteristics of land and aquatic mammal. <br>
There would have been little need for the man's genitals to have <br>
changed position regardless of living environment, so biologists look to <br>
the woman's body for clues, just as they would with any mammal.  <br>
<p>
Interestingly enough, Freud's work has been cited in connection with <br>
this theory, because he discovered during his study of dreams that <br>
water figures prominently in the dreams of persons who are <br>
experiencing periods of great stress.  Cognitive theories state that <br>
our emotional systems are wired to be triggered by stimuli that may <br>
have been encountered by primitive human, therefore it would not be <br>
unreasonable to consider that water may have played a significant <br>
role in our early history.  <br>
