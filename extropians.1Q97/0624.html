<i>&gt; &gt;Even if De Garis's interpretations are hideous, his facts are still</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;facts--"things of substance".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         Bullshit.  I have yet to see a single 'fact' on de Garis' part.  As</i><br>
<i>&gt; I said about a week ago, de Garis has made a number of estimations based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; heresy and irrational testing.  A fact is something that *is*.  If someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; says that there are 14 male geniuses to every 1 female genius, I'm not going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to accept it as fact unless it is *proven* beyond a doubt.  Show me all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; SAT scores so I can see for myself if he is right.  The question is this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; did he see *all* the SAT scores before he made his conclusion?  I very much</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt it.</i><br>
<p>
That's one question, but not the one most worthy of spending energy on.<br>
The point is this: if there is a 14-to-1 ratio of men to women at a certain<br>
level of the SAT--assuming he didn't just make it up, which I grant you is<br>
possible though I think unlikely--then that's just a number.  Facts aren't<br>
good or bad, they just are.  The job is to determine if it means anything.<br>
<p>
I suspect that there are many reasons for it: (1) de Garis probably chose<br>
some arbitrary cutoff value specifically chosen to exaggerate the effect;<br>
(2) more males take the SAT, because our culture encourages males more<br>
than females, and de Garis probably didn't adjust for that either; (3)<br>
the tests are written by men, and are designed to test the kinds of<br>
intelligence that men find important; (4) other influences in our culture<br>
encourage traits in boys that lead them to perform well on this one test.<br>
<p>
Sure, it can't hurt to check his basic numbers either, but I suspect the<br>
numbers are correct and the explanations are interesting and worthy of<br>
study.  Just shouting "bigot" because you don't like his result plays<br>
right into his hands, because it shows a refusal to deal with the issue.<br>
