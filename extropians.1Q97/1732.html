<i>&gt; Lately, in the last year or two, I have been practicing the trick</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, one of the things that happened to me as a result of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; practice is that where I used to find people who talked about God</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomprehensible 90% of the time, now I only find them incomprehensible</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10% of the time (the low rate is because I successfully avoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; communicative contact with the most obnoxious of the God-talkers).</i><br>

This subject of adjusting comprehensibility by shifting internal<br>
perspective precisely describes the kind of phenomena that would be <br>
expected from a cognitive process that operates by shifting through<br>
Fourier spaces in search of localized representations as I described <br>
in my response to Lyle last night.  I find it an amazing synchroni-<br>
city that you would post something now that exemplifies this so well.<br>
Check out my post if you haven't yet!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        And my previous (limited) understanding of some of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the stuff emanating from Taoism and Zen Buddhism fits in pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt; well with my more recent understanding of traditional Western</i><br>
<i>&gt; mysticism. I suppose that mysticism could be defined as "the wisdom</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you have to figure out for yourself"</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps the one thing we most have to teach ourselves is the<br>
meta-memetic skill of how to shift through Fourier spaces in<br>
search of the comprehensibility needed for any given moment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, anti-God-talk such as Nietzsche's THE ANTICHRIST still</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes just as much sense to me as it used to also. I guess I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; advancing *from* my philosophical commitments, as Bartley might</i><br>
<i>&gt; say. The less I am seduced away from the-reality-that's-in-front-of-my-nose</i><br>
<i>&gt; by teasing, tempting abstractions, the better my life seems to get.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think abstractions make good tools but poor masters.</i><br>
<p>
That opposites like this can both be comprehensible is a no-brainer<br>
for a brain that operates by shifting though Fourier spaces.  What<br>
is intuitively obvious in one space, would in a sufficiently dif-<br>
ferent space not simply be wrong, but complete nonsense.  But by<br>
doing this in a general way, we none the less have at least some<br>
ability to bounce back and forth between these spaces.<br>
