<i>&gt; certainly.  Not the same.</i><br>
<p>
A reasonable immune system would consist of "bone marrow units" that<br>
produce immune nanites ("blue goo") and distributes them, and "lymph<br>
units" that integrate their information. The "bone marrow" would mutate<br>
and evolve new kinds of immune nanites as needed (controlled by<br>
information from the "lymph units"; &lt;Nanite species 67267247 only 3%<br>
effective against antigen 47902444, Nanite species 67267448 78% effective;<br>
increase production of 67267448 and try mutating it&gt;). <br>
<p>

<i>&gt; intelligent.)</i><br>
<p>
What worries me is that it is not unreasonable to build a nanite that<br>
converts organic compounds into diamondoid, but normal life cannot convert<br>
diamondoid into organics (I think; there might be some bacterium who does<br>
this). This means that over time unchecked nanite spread *could* lock<br>
Earth into a diamondoid ecology instead. Waves of grey goo eating the<br>
Earth are unlikely, but a "golden goo" disaster where some nanite<br>
accidentally upsets biology on a large scale is possible (like a cell<br>
medical nanite that starts hunting *all* bacteria and replicates in<br>
nature).  That is why we need to have immune systems that are flexible and<br>
general *before* the nanites get loose in the biosphere (eventually, they<br>
will). Its main use might not be to defend against attacks from enemies <br>
but to remove nonfunctional nanites (&lt;Remove species 3476347&gt;).<br>

<i>&gt; } into the design software for nanotech. Perhaps make shure that the software</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not exist in oxygen?  That probably isn't hard.  Tiny, energetic, carbon</i><br>
<i>&gt; particles.  Yumm.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, making a nanite that could thrive in nature would be tricky. <br>
UV, oxygen, a very non-standard environment and possibly competition from <br>
bacteria. <br>
