&lt;&lt; <br>
 In 1987 Chet Fleming self-published a book called "If We Can Keep A<br>
 Severed Head Alive".  When I last talked to him in the early nineties<br>
 he was doing business as Polinym Press at PO Box 22140, St Louis, <br>
 Missouri, 63116.  His 1994 listing was 10028 Manchester, St Louis,<br>
 Missouri, 63122, (314) 968-0986. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
...yeah - GREAT TITLE!!! but a friend of mine has that book and I read a bit<br>
of it, didn't he warn of the horrors or dangers of this technology? and ask<br>
that no one ever use it? And wasn't he religious to boot?<br>
