Regarding the contribution of Christianity (what I prefer to call<br>
'Christism') to science and progress.<br>
<p>
This is a difficult thing to talk about because (I believe) historians<br>
have not yet seen through to the bottom of events circa the beginning of<br>
the common era.<br>
<p>
Here's my potted version:  Round about 600 b.c.e. onwards, as a result<br>
of the culture clash caused by the Alexandrian empire and improved<br>
communications, the old religious forms, based as they were on tribal<br>
certainties, began to be doubted, and people started to roll their own<br>
religions.  These were largely of a Gnostic/Theurgic/Mysteries form, in<br>
which each individual for him or herself faces the mystery of the<br>
universe alone and nekkid (without the doubtful tribal intercessors and<br>
cultural filters). This (along with the usual Greek and Roman philosophical<br>
sources) is the true origin of the individualistic/libertarian meme.<br>
<p>
By the time of Constantine, these forms of Gnosis had so burgeoned and<br>
infected the Roman Empire (supplanting the old Roman state religion)  that<br>
some Romans feared it was in danger of dissolution from within. (Of<br>
course the real reason for the dissolution of the Roman Empire was the<br>
decay of Republicanism, but that's another story!)  So Constantine<br>
either co-opted or created an eclectic form of Gnosticism/Theurgy as the<br>
new Roman State religion.<br>
<p>
If he co-opted, he must have found an already eclectic and pretty<br>
corrupt form of Gnosticism/Theurgy, and simply promised its leaders<br>
sweets ("We will help you destroy your ideological enemies if you allow<br>
us to make your religion, suitably altered, a state religion").<br>
<p>
If he created, he must have gotten some sort of council of corrupt and<br>
dissatisfied power-lusting leaders of various sects together, and paid<br>
them to create an eclectic form.<br>
<p>
Hence, there *are* minute amounts of truth to be found in Christist<br>
doctrine, but these are pretty subtle, and are only  teaseable-out by<br>
intelligent, charitable interpretation, and are more than outweighed by<br>
those aspects that make Christism such a suitable religion for dominators.<br>
<p>
(Note: I follow prof. G.A.Wells' notion that 'Christ' never existed, and<br>
is a mythical figure who became historical, somewhat in the manner of<br>
William Tell.  This would tend to support the 'co-opted sect' version of<br>
the above history.)<br>
<p>
It is also of interest to note that 'Christian' may have been a sort of<br>
general term denoting the burgeoning Gnostic/Theurgic sects.  'Chrestoi'<br>
(meaning 'anointed', as in anointing a king) was a common appelation<br>
found on the tombs of members of various Gnostic/Theurgic/ Mysteries<br>
sects round about the period  in question, IN SOME CASES ON TOMBS B.C.E..<br>
It meant something like 'justified', as in 'soul weighed and not found<br>
wanting' (compare the Egyptian Book of the Dead).<br>
<p>
I think it will take a good many years of non-Christist research, and<br>
not a few more lucky discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls and Nag<br>
Hammadi, before we even begin to understand what happened then, and the<br>
terrible darkness that fell over the earth with the rise of Christism as<br>
a result of what happened then.<br>
