<i>&gt; &gt;   Transhumanism by non-technical means is a common religious goal;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Again, though there are exceptions, I think it is more often that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; find transpersonalism rather than transhumanism to be a religious goal.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Where transhumanism tends to be directed towards the individuation and</i><br>
<i>&gt; autonomy of self, transpersonalism is directed towards the mystical</i><br>
<i>&gt; diffusion [or at the least, subservience] of self. </i><br>
<p>
  Perhaps in the common European and American traditions, but there<br>
are notable instances of what might properly be called transhumanism<br>
in other widespread religions.  In Hindu tradition, for example, if<br>
one does well in this lifetime, one reincarnates as a more advanced<br>
person, perhaps even as a deity -- or if a simpler animal does well,<br>
it may reincarnate as a more complicated one, or as a human.  Or, one<br>
may reincarnate in a form particularly well suited to learning<br>
whatever it is that one needs to know in order to progress on the path<br>
of advancement.  And in one Chinese religious tradition, the current<br>
Queen of Heaven -- a major deity -- is an indentifiable historical<br>
human being, a rather ordinary woman (at the time of her life) who<br>
died many generations ago.  In this tradition, deceased persons are<br>
venerated, and this particular woman became popular and got<br>
"promoted", so to speak.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ... religion and science ...  One evolved from the other and we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; say this without being ashamed.</i><br>
<p>
  Agreed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;   What is uncommon here most notably includes the attempt to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; non-technical transhumanism by ritual mass suicide.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Here and in the first sentence of your post you seem to refer to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; technological aspect of transhumanism as that which separates it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone else refered to as the "Nuts of the Millenium".</i><br>
<p>
  Often the perceived distinction between Nuts of the Millenium and<br>
Bold, Visionary Pioneers, is the judgement call of the perceiver on<br>
whether the persons in question have any chance of getting where they<br>
are trying to go.  I agree with your (subsequent, unquoted) remarks<br>
about the part of us that feels being important; nonetheless, if I did<br>
not believe that transhumanism by technology was possible, then the<br>
emphasis that Extropian debate places upon it would be sufficient, in<br>
my own mind, to place Extropians well into the "nuts" category.  (For<br>
clarity, I should add that I *do* believe that transhumanism by<br>
technology is possible, and I also believe that many other aspects of<br>
Extropian philosophy are non-nutty.)  Probably not "Nuts of the<br>
Millenium", though -- there is a lot of competition for that title,<br>
and there are still several years to go.  Enter early and often...<br>
