We already have a model for an Anarcho-Capitalist defense system for petty<br>
crime, property theft, and murder.  That system is the master-planned<br>
community with an elected city government.  It protects the community well,<br>
keeps the police responsible to the protectees, and benefits from full<br>
economies of scale as everybody on the street is a protectee.<br>
<p>
Democracy has a lot of problems for determining nationwide retirement systems<br>
and drug regulation.  But remember modern American democracy evolved from<br>
town governance systems and it's just fine for that.  Police takeovers aren't<br>
too much of a problem with that system, and there are defenses against that<br>
with resident police and an armed citizenry.  In an anarchic system no doubt<br>
there would be insurance for renegade police as well; but that's a backup<br>
defense, just as the main line of defense against fire is a fireproof roof,<br>
fire extinguishers, and a sprinkler system, not the fire insurance company.<br>
<p>
Shopping malls and office centers will provide protection acceptably too, of<br>
course, as safety is an essential part of what they sell.  No safety, no<br>
sales; mafioso protection, no sales either.  No need for democratic controls<br>
there.<br>
