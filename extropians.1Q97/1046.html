Yes, although it seems somewhat pointless to me - 1+1=3 isn't a worthy <br>
goal, it is just a random goal. A more interesting series of worlds would <br>
be higher and higher dimensional. <br>
<p>

<p>
Others have answered this, but you point out an interesting question: how <br>
far can we adapt our basic mind-template? Are there narrow limits to what <br>
human brains can think about or perceive in some "conceptual directions"? <br>
Let's ignore obvious limits of complexity (like concepts that require you <br>
to hold 100 sub-concepts in mind at the same time or structures that are <br>
larger than human memory storage). <br>
<p>
Of course, if you are a Strong AI adherent like me, then you have to admit<br>
that Gödel in principle applies to the human mind, and we have Gödel<br>
strings... <br>
