<i>&gt; From:          Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;lcrocker@calweb.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; He claims precisely that; he just doesn't have the balls to say it</i><br>
<i>&gt; in plain English, but leaves it as the implication of evasive</i><br>
<i>&gt; rhetoric that would make a spin doctor proud.  If he means something</i><br>
<i>&gt; different, I can't fathom it.  Perhaps I am seeing meanings that</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't there, or I am over-reaching because of the insidiously evil</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas he then spouts, but I think not.  I think he really means to</i><br>
<i>&gt; imply exactly what I think he implies, and his words are meant to</i><br>
<i>&gt; attack that implication because he can't attack the facts.</i><br>
<p>
Ok.  I think I can understand that.  I don't agree with your<br>
argument but at least I can gather that your argument was not a<br>
deliberate misrepresentation, but rather based on what you percieve<br>
his intended meaning to be (as opposed to the literal words).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, I do get emotional about this particular subject, because this</i><br>
<i>&gt; man, others like him, and his ideas are the most serious danger to</i><br>
<i>&gt; my life and liberty imaginable.  He is a liar, a coward, a rich</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypocrite who wants to keep others from having the success he has</i><br>
<i>&gt; achieved by manipulating the collectivist government to use its guns</i><br>
<i>&gt; to keep them down now that he's got his.  I would not allow this man</i><br>
<i>&gt; into my house, or sit at a table with him.  Reading his words fills</i><br>
<i>&gt; me with moral revulsion.  Is that emotional enough?</i><br>
<p>
Plenty.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I try to maintain some semblance of reason under these conditions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I'm not perfect.</i><br>
<p>
Define "semblance" and "perfect".  (just kidding)<br>
<p>
                                        Peace,<br>
                                        William Kitchen<br>
