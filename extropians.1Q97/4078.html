Recently there was a thread on possible revisions to the Extropian<br>
Principles. I don't know if its worth serious consideration or not,<br>
[this is more of a refinement than a revision] but thought I would put<br>
my own two cents in and offer a small criticism on the principle of<br>
Self-Transformation.<br>
<p>
I think there is an element of dynamic mutability lacking in the<br>
Extropic definition of self-transformation. The definition seems to be<br>
oriented towards progressive change, while overlooking the issue of<br>
dynamic contextual change, change for the impending moment, rather than<br>
merely change in anticipation for the future. <br>
<p>
As "perpetual self-improvement", The way we look at self-transformation<br>
now, we are going to become something better in the future, and then<br>
something still better, and then something still better, ad infinitum.<br>
But imagine that we developed our technological augmentation with<br>
mutability in mind. Then we might each individually possess an<br>
archetypal arsenal of physical embodiments at our disposal in any given<br>
moment. From this archetypal arsenal we could then choose the physical<br>
embodiment which best suited our anticipation of the impending moments<br>
ahead. And of course, each archetypal embodiment could then me modified<br>
realtime in sort of a feedback between the individual and the<br>
individual's contextual circumstances. This is probably sounding like<br>
something in the realm of science fiction, and has been developed in<br>
that genre before [shape shifters, etcetera], but there is atleast one<br>
aspect of our lives that this idea of dynamic mutability can be applied<br>
today, and thats in our states of mind. In something of a "yogic"<br>
fashion we can develop our own personal archetypal arsenal of states of<br>
mind, and then as our circumstances change we can dynamically shift<br>
between these modalities of consciousness to best suit our immiediate<br>
goals. We already do this of course, we are in a different modality of<br>
consciousness when we are driving a car than when we are reading a book,<br>
but when we actually start focusing on it we can make the process all<br>
the more effective. <br>
<p>
Just as one day it may become as easy for us to alter our state of mind<br>
as it is for us now to "change our minds" [to change what we are<br>
thinking about], it may also one day become as easy for us to modify or<br>
change our physical embodiments as it is for us now to "change our<br>
minds".<br>
<p>
IMHO, I think the addition of this concept of dynamic protean mutability<br>
might be useful to the Extropic principle of self-transformation. Just a<br>
thought ...<br>
<p>
Explore and play!<br>
