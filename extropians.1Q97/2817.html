I'm not sure how beneficial this will be to us as individuals.<br>
The ability to make clones in itself will not allow individuals to<br>
improve their own genetics.  No doubt the technique will allow new<br>
research directions which will shed useful light on various diseases<br>
and genetic problems, but if we focus on human cloning itself I don't<br>
see many direct benefits.<br>
<p>
There are serious problems raised as well.  Let us suppose that it<br>
becomes relatively common for people to choose to give birth to a<br>
clone of an existing person rather than a new individual with randomly<br>
chosen genetics.  You can get a sure thing rather than a crap shoot.<br>
Of course the sure thing may lack any of the parents' genes, but the<br>
experience of people who adopt children suggests that this may not be<br>
much of a barrier.  You can have a child who is virtually guaranteed to<br>
be a genius, or have marvelous atheletic or musical talent, or to be a<br>
physical beauty, simply by cloning an adult with these characteristics.<br>
<p>
Or people may choose to clone themselves, Mommy's little girl and Daddy's<br>
little boy.  Everyone who ever secretly wanted a twin sibling can now<br>
get their wish, albeit gratification delayed.  You can raise your clone<br>
just the way you would have wanted to be raised.<br>
<p>
These are new ideas and it is easy to have a knee-jerk negative reaction,<br>
but maybe they aren't that bad.  We could actually see a tremendous<br>
improvement in productivity and creativity, especially if we believe that<br>
progress is largely caused by the most talented people.  There could<br>
be a whole generation of scientific geniuses, composers, entertainers.<br>
It could be a new renaissance as the human race ascends to a higher level,<br>
a big step towards the Singularity.<br>
<p>
At the same time there are obvious problems with such a society.  A<br>
child who grows up as a clone is going to be facing an unusual set of<br>
expectations.  Hopefully his innate talents will be in close accordance<br>
with his pre-programmed career goals, so that the Michael Jordan clones<br>
will take to basketball as soon as they can walk.  And these would not<br>
be the first people to find they were born to greatness; think of the<br>
industrial or royal heirs of the past.  Many people have thrived in such<br>
an environment.  After some trial and error, clones can be identified<br>
who do so as well.  But the casualties along the way could be very ugly.<br>
And I doubt that the mommy-clones will do well very often.<br>
<p>
The loss of diversity could be a long term problem, as we fix on the<br>
best people in the current gene pool without doing the continual search<br>
needed to find better people to clone.  This is like a simulated annealing<br>
optimization program where you cool it too fast.  It would be better to<br>
have a lot of the Einsteins marry the lady geniuses, hoping to get some<br>
even-better kids out of the mix to serve as future clone sources.  Social<br>
problems could arise as well as more people fell into just a few clonal<br>
families; without the broad range of human characteristics we have today<br>
people might feel alienated from others who were too different from them.<br>
<p>
Ownership of genetic code is an interesting problem with a lot of<br>
similarities to today's debate about intellectual property.  Copying<br>
someone's genetic code (which might in theory be possible simply by<br>
stealing a few flaked-off skin cells) doesn't hurt him any; he hasn't<br>
lost anything by it.  Should a person be able to control how and when<br>
new clones of himself are made?  If so, how about second-generation copies?<br>
Can the Van Cliburn clones make money by cloning themselves, or do they<br>
have to pay royalties to their "upline"?<br>
<p>
Overall, this is a very mixed bag.  I suppose one important fact is that<br>
by the time humans are cloned and grown, enough other changes will have<br>
occured that this will be just one of many ways that people will be able<br>
to control their biology.  But hopefully the newer technologies will<br>
give people control over their own bodies rather than their children's.<br>
