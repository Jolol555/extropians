<i>&gt; Consider these 3 reasons why someone might take an extreme view:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  They like to be extreme so they can shock people and feel special.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.  They have to reason through everything for themselves from basics,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     and refuse to rely in any way on the opinions of others.  A small </i><br>
<i>&gt;     fraction of these people will inevitably take an extreme view.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.  They take the opinions of others seriously as an important source</i><br>
<i>&gt;     of information, and only take an extreme position when they think</i><br>
<i>&gt;     they have a particularly unique source of info on the subject, or </i><br>
<i>&gt;     when they think an especially strong but apparently overlooked</i><br>
<i>&gt;     case can be made from publicly available information.</i><br>
<p>
An interesting taxonomy, and worth thinking about, but I see myself<br>
as all three.  I do not discount the value of shock, I have particular<br>
disdain for unjustified authority, and I am thoroughly convinced by<br>
a few overlooked, unpopular, but brilliant arguments.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So if you want your extreme views to be taken seriously by other</i><br>
<i>&gt; people, you aught to try to look like a type 3 extremist.  And if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to make good decisions over all, you aught to try and be a type</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3 person.  This means making a good effort to find reasons why smart</i><br>
<i>&gt; thoughtful people might disagree with you.</i><br>
<p>
This is two different contentions, and I see no connection between<br>
them.  If the majority of those I am trying to convince are swayed by<br>
their impression of how you fit into that grouping, then it might make<br>
sense for me to give the appropriate impression.  But why must I let<br>
their judgements affect me?  Why must I personally give in to their<br>
intellectual pathology that judges ideas by their holders rather than<br>
by their actual merits?<br>
<p>
I do not wholly discount the value of other opinions: indeed, there<br>
are many whose opinions have earned my considerable respect, which<br>
causes me to think much harder about disagreeing with them.  It has<br>
taken me years, for example, to convince myself that my position on<br>
copyrights and patents is the only sound and rational one, because<br>
the fact that Rand and Friedman do not hold that opinion spurred me<br>
to extra effort to try to understand why they were mistaken.  But the<br>
value of any opinion--whether the majority, or a authority who got<br>
there by accomplishment, or an authority who got there by fiat--is<br>
to serve as a check-and-balance to one's own reason, not a substitute<br>
for it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, others tend to think of our social systems as fragile and</i><br>
<i>&gt; interdependent, and so think more global oversight and control is</i><br>
<i>&gt; needed to prevent contagion from local experiments from threatening</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything else.  It bothers me that I don't have good arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt; against this view.</i><br>
<p>
Your existence is the argument against that view.  Your ancestors<br>
made it through ice ages, famines, wars, and technological changes<br>
no less dramatic in their time than our ideas are in ours.  They<br>
survived, and flourished.  Their "social systems" may not have, but<br>
good riddance.  We found better ones.  We will find better still.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This highlights another core issue: to what degree does social pressure</i><br>
<i>&gt; function to stabilize our social order?  Economists like me, who tend</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ignore social pressure in our models, tend to think that the effect</i><br>
<i>&gt; is minor.  But others see social pressure which keeps people acting</i><br>
<i>&gt; "nice" and punishes very "selfish" behavior as central.  And so they</i><br>
<i>&gt; fear the consequences if this pressure is relaxed.  It bothers me</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I don't have better arguments to say why they are mistaken.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure they're mistaken either.  But the existence of social<br>
pressure, and its possible efficacy or even necessity, begs the<br>
question of what it is pressure toward.  One cannot judge raw ability,<br>
one judges how it is used.  If the existing social pressure is<br>
toward demonstrably ineffective policies, then one should not ask<br>
how to eliminate the pressure, but how to alter it to be pressure<br>
toward more effective policies.  That is, one should concentrate on<br>
results, not motives.<br>
