Since there was some discussion about this not too long ago, I thought <br>
I'd forward the following Reuters story:<br>
<p>
         TORONTO (Reuter) - The end of the universe as humans know it  <br>
will occur in about 10 trillion years, but certain physical <br>
processes will continue as far into the future as astronomers <br>
can imagine, scientists reported Wednesday. <br>
         For all practical purposes, what we think of as the universe  <br>
will end when all the big stars like our Sun stop shining, said <br>
astrophysicist Fred Adams of the University of Michigan: ``At <br>
that time, a human eye on Earth would observe the universe to be <br>
dark and black.'' <br>
         But there would be no human eyes to observe it, Adams and  <br>
his colleague Greg Laughlin said at a news conference, because <br>
by that point Earth's oceans would have boiled away in the Sun's <br>
dying flameout, reducing the planet to an uninhabitable cinder. <br>
         However, Adams stressed that these predictions have no  <br>
effect on the details of current earthly life: ``As we approach <br>
the end of this millenium, I'd like to make the point that the <br>
end is not that near.'' <br>
         ``The universe will never end,'' Laughlin said. ``... The  <br>
universe will always be here and interesting things will <br>
continue to occur.'' <br>
         Unlike many astronomers, whose studies have focused on the  <br>
history of the universe, Adams and Laughlin peered into the <br>
distant future by applying ``fundamental physical laws,'' they <br>
told reporters at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society <br>
in Toronto. <br>
         To put their research into context, it is useful to remember  <br>
that current estimates set the age of the universe at perhaps 10 <br>
billion to 15 billion years. To even discuss the far-off future <br>
they envisioned, the researchers had to make up a new <br>
measurement of time: the cosmological decade. <br>
         By this measurement, 10 trillion years would be described as  <br>
13 cosmological decades -- or a 1 with 13 zeroes in front of it. <br>
         In 14 cosmological decades -- 100 trillion years -- the very  <br>
last stars, including smaller ones that will live longer than <br>
our Sun, will be dead, the scientists said. <br>
         After that will be a so-called Degenerate Era populated by  <br>
burned-out stars and mysterious matter-sucking black holes. <br>
Galaxies like our Milky Way will ``relax'' with some star <br>
remnants moving toward the edge of the galaxy and others falling <br>
into the center of it. <br>
         By about cosmological decade 37, the decay of sub-atomic  <br>
particles called protons will begin, ringing ``the death knell <br>
for carbon-based life as we know it,'' Laughlin said. <br>
         In subsequent decades, dubbed the Black Hole Era, black  <br>
holes will radiate away their mass and disappear. <br>
         By about the 100th cosmological decade the aptly-named Dark  <br>
Era will begin, and about this era little is known. The universe <br>
will consist of a ``diffuse sea of electrons, positrons, <br>
neutrinos and radiation,'' Adams said. <br>
         Also presented at the astronomy meeting was the first  <br>
three-dimensional map of the Milky Way galaxy. The map, put <br>
together using 20 years worth of data, was constructed by the <br>
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.<br>
