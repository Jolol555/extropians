<i>&gt;&gt; Would you "put your money where your mouth is" and actually move to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; libertarian colony?</i><br>
<p>
Greg:<br>
<i>&gt; This question has been discussed before, with some acute insights from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Robin Hanson, if memory serves.  The problem is one of relative benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; and cost.  Immigration to a "new society" will have costs associated</i><br>
<i>&gt; with it for specific individuals.  The more economically and socially</i><br>
<i>&gt; established and successful an individual is in the "old world", the</i><br>
<i>&gt; less favorable an immigration decision will be.  Likewise, the more</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic opportunity and liberty is available in an "old world"</i><br>
<i>&gt; society, the less favorable an immigration decision will be.  A review</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the character of phases of immigration to North America reflects</i><br>
<i>&gt; these factors starkly.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In practical terms, these factors mean that the new "libertarian colony"</i><br>
<i>&gt; has to offer significant relative advantages to entice immigrants from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "old world".  They also mean that the immigration decision will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; evaluated differently for differently-situated inhabitants of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; specific "old world" society.  The paradox is that some of the people</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a "brave new (libertarian) world" will want most to attract are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ones with the highest threshhold to overcome in this equation.</i><br>
<p>
On the other hand, the new libertarian colony can use the proven <br>
and immensely successful "academic" strategy.  Not many people would<br>
just emigrate to a place where they have no ties of any kind.  A free<br>
education will create those ties, and the mentioned barrier becomes<br>
negligible---who wouldn't spend a semester or two in an exotic place?<br>
In other words, create a place one wants to return to, not escape to.<br>
<p>
