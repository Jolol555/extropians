I'd like a high income, too. High enough to allow me to pay my phone bills, finance <br>
my computer activities, realize myself. But is it still self-interest to accumulate <br>
millions or even billions? Is it need? If this wealth was shared, nobody would have <br>
to starve. There would be no poverty. Everything would be great, fantastic, perfect.<br>

The problem you ignore is accumulation.<br>
