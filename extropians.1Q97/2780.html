People should be able to educate their kids, or decide if their kids are<br>

The cost of losing a poor person, or insane one, is primarily to<br>
themself, or those who would have been immediately around them.  Yes<br>
some benefit of their profitable existence would trickle out to you, but<br>
the gain is primarily local -- themself and those they would have traded<br>
with; such locality is how the system works in the first place.  So you<br>
could redeem people with local effort; educate them thoroughly, and then<br>
repay yourself out of their profits until you're repaid.  Student loans.<br>
If it's not profitable for you to do this, it won't be much more<br>
profitable for society, and the lost margin is probably small enough as<br>
to not be worth the risks of having a global coordinator.<br>
