<i>&gt; You're saying that people [knew] exactly what slavery was like, they just</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't realize it was "immoral"?  I find this hard to fathom.   I</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead see two major changes from the past:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  People were getting richer, and richer folks can better afford to</i><br>
<i>&gt; indulge their "moral" feelings. </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)  U.S. slave were unusual in history: the slave population grew locally.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In contrast, most slaves were spoils of war/domination imported from</i><br>
<i>&gt; elsewhere, and who didn't reproduce very well locally.  Its lots</i><br>
<i>&gt; easier to be cruel to foreigners than to locals.  </i><br>
<p>
Both of those seem plausible, but I still think the most fundamental<br>
underlying change is moral belief itself.  People believe all kinds of<br>
crazy things; why is it so hard to accept that they believed any of a<br>
number of justifications for the common practice of slavery: racial<br>
inferiority, economic necessity, right of conquest.  It is part of our<br>
mental machinery to de-sensitize ourselves to everyday things.<br>
<p>
Let's take an example from modern times: circumcision.  Objectively,<br>
it is absolutely no different from female genital mutilation as<br>
practiced in Muslim nations.  It has no medical basis (though you<br>
will hear many doctors give post-hoc justifications for it that have<br>
more evasive maneuvers than a submarine), it is provably painful to<br>
the infant (and many still ignore that fact and claim otherwise).<br>
In short, it is useless, barbaric, cruel, ... and commonplace.  I'm<br>
not saying that moels and OBs are heartless machines; most are likely<br>
very compassionate people.  But they were brought up with certain<br>
mystical beliefs, and never challenged them with proper reasoning.<br>
But the moel knows what is involved--he sees the blood, he hears the<br>
cries, he has just used belief to immunize his mind from the facts.<br>
He simply does not "know" that it is immoral, because he has failed<br>
to ask the question and rationally pursue the answer.<br>
