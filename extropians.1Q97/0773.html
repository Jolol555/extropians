QM&gt; If a balance of thoughtfulness and detachment is sought, then you have<br>
QM&gt; to allow for [emotions], even if you know you cannot be ruled by them<br>
<p>
LC&gt; I don't seek "balance" or whatever other new-age mystical nonsense you<br>
LC&gt; would have me seek.  I seek reality.  And I am not ruled by anything<br>
LC&gt; but the laws of physics.<br>
<p>
QM&gt; That is really insulting, I am not suggesting  you see  new age ,<br>
QM&gt; nonsense, or anything of the sort....<br>
<p>
I merely expressed my evaluation of the sentence above; you are free<br>
to feel insulted by my beliefs if you like, none was intended.  I don't<br>
know anything about you personally.  I believe that words have meaning.<br>
To what specific referent do the words "balance of thoughfulness and<br>
detachment" refer?  Upon what scale, by what unit of measure, am I to<br>
seek this "balance"?  What do you mean by "allow for" emotions?  Do you<br>
mean to recognize that they exist?  If so, what have I said contrary<br>
to that?  If I have said something to imply that I don't "allow for"<br>
emotions, please point it out so I can understand what you mean. <br>
<p>
I cannot find enough meaning in that sentence to apply reason to it,<br>
so I evaluate it as mystical rambling.  I cannot apply any other<br>
evaluation to it by my standards, and I cannot know what reaction<br>
others may have to my evaluations.  If you think I have been dishonest,<br>
or unclear, or made a mistake of reason, or employ improper standards<br>
of reason, then you are welcome to point them out to me, and I will<br>
listen.  I won't promise to agree, or even to understand, if I cannot.<br>
