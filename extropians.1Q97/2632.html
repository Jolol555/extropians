I don't think people would work non-stop, simply because (as you point <br>
out) they would become non-productive. My guess is that the work would <br>
become divided into a loose schedule broken up by other activities. It <br>
would certainly change the way we look at free time and work. <br>
<p>

<p>
Ah, that explains a lot... :-)<br>

Exactly! I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people decided against <br>
removing sleep, which would limit the use of not sleeping for many of the <br>
sleepless (except for us solitary scientists and writers, of course). <br>
<p>
However, I doubt it will be easy to remove sleep. My current belief is<br>
that it is used by the brain to encode the memories of the day from<br>
hippocampal storage; this process cannot be easily speeded up without<br>
wholesale neurological redesign, and without it we would not learn or<br>
remember well (might be useful for some politicians, though). But maybe we<br>
could use lucid dreaming techniques to remain aware and effective anyway? <br>
Just because we are physically immobile doesn't mean we have to remain in <br>
our heads...<br>
