Nonetheless, Chinese is a poor language for coding new concepts that are too<br>
far outside their existing concept set.  One of the big problems faced by<br>
many Asian countries (especially less developed ones) is that most written<br>
language is translated *through* Chinese, even if neither the original nor<br>
the end translation were in Chinese.  <br>
<p>
An example:  When books are translated from English into Vietnamese, they<br>
are first translated into Chinese (even the Vietnamese-Americans do this!).<br>
The problem is that Chinese translations force every English concept and<br>
word into their symbol set, even if it has no equivalent.  The Chinese<br>
language does poor distinction, especially when nouns are involved IMO.  The<br>
translation from Chinese into Vietnamese is easy, but the result is very<br>
poor even though the languages map onto each other pretty well.  Proper<br>
nouns are demolished.  New conceptual containers are destroyed.  "Software"<br>
becomes translated as "a soft thing" (like a pillow!) and "Frame Relay"<br>
makes no sense at all.  "Frame" and "Relay" are broken apart and translated<br>
into their more mundane definitions which apparently must make sense in<br>
Chinese.  Yet direct English-Vietnamese translations do not suffer this type<br>
of problem.  Apparently the "translate through Chinese" thing is a really<br>
big issue in Asia right now because it is putting a lot of countries at a<br>
disadvantage in technology fields.  Even most American book publishers<br>
translate through Chinese first.  I understand there is a historical reason<br>
why this is, but I don't know what it is.<br>
<p>
English may not be very efficient, organized, or pretty, but it is a superb<br>
conceptual container, mostly for the same reasons.  English descriptive<br>
