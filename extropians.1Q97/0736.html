Ha.  I've been working for years now on this, trying to position myself to<br>
the point where I would have enough resources and capital to pursue this.<br>
Eventually, I want to start the company that I actually intend to "go all<br>
the way".  This will be the biggest case of bootstrapping you ever saw,<br>
seeing as how I started out 5 years ago with nothing.  I am currently in the<br>
planning stages of starting a software company that I intend to use to<br>
generate my initial capital towards this goal.  I have thus far been very<br>
successful in the software industry and believe I can milk it for 10s of<br>
millions of dollars.<br>
At some point I will start pumping money directly into R&amp;D for an attempt at<br>
doing a "corporate takeover" of profitable space assets.<br>
<p>
Most companies are simply too short-sighted.  A company with serious space<br>
assets could be turning profits in the $trillion$ within a few years.  Bill<br>
Gates will look like a beggar in contrast to the wealth this would create.<br>
<p>
My estimated cost for building a decent space industry: USD 50-100 billion.<br>
It is within the range of some of the very large multi-national<br>
conglomerates.  Since I don't have access to any multi-national<br>
conglomerates, I am going to build my own.<br>
<p>
I intend to be there in 20-30 years.  You can bank on it.<br>
