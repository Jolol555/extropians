<i>&gt;What is to be done?</i><br>
<p>
Take a look at the masses following Wired magazine into the future proudly<br>
proclaiming transhumanism. Get ready to add that list of quotes to that<br>
"What the experts say..." list. Every major breakthrough has been fought at<br>
the start just as they fought against vaccines when they first came out for<br>
smallpox telling wild stories of how people were going to turn into cows<br>
and other nonsense because they used fluid from the sores of a similar cow<br>
disease. And then the classic "If people were meant to fly, God would've<br>
given them wings." Today these both are entirely stupid and those quotes<br>
you meantioned before will be also. Naturally any radical ideas will be<br>
rejected by an established peer-based scientific social order system. The<br>
best ideas *NEVER* come from official, established sources. Everyone is<br>
afraid of the unknown but we rush out to greet it. We're on the cutting<br>
edge of evolution. The pioneers. We are the dreamers and creators of the<br>
future. Once society gets over future shock and all the media attention,<br>
ideas will no longer sound alien and will become absorbed by society. I've<br>
just seen a recent news story on TV about a woman who had identical<br>
quadruplets and the media referred to the phenomenon as GET THIS: "Natures<br>
version of cloning". The media appears to be already done with the initial<br>
"shock value" mode and may now even  creating acceptance for it through<br>
subtle memes. Another aspect of the whole "negative outlook on the future"<br>
meme is directly related to the approaching millenium. Get ready for all<br>
the "hell, fire, and brimstone" people to come out en masse and proclaim<br>
the end is near! This creates a uneasy memetic environment and puts a bad<br>
taste in everyone's mouth by tainting their visions of a positive future<br>
being constantly bombarded by negative outlooks.<br>

 to lose sight of the shore."<br>
