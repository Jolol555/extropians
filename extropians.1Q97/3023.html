<i>&gt;I've picked up a copy of "At Home In the Universe" some weeks ago, and I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;sorry to say I found it to be quite weak. [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Where's the beef?! one might be tempted to exclaim.</i><br>
<p>
(I love the combination of crude and proper language there.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A heavily watered down version of TOOO, nothing else. [...]</i><br>
<p>
Well, I got something interesting out of it: after reading TOOO, there<br>
were a couple questions I was really confused about (what exactly is the<br>
"error catastrophe" and why is it important? and what does he mean saying<br>
SO is opposed to selection?) and I dreaded rereading TOOO (huge) to try to<br>
figure these things out (no guarantee).<br>
<p>
So At Home functioned as a sort of fast-forward, for-dummies version of<br>
stuff I remembered the details of.  Got the answers to the questions and<br>
a little more.  Basically:<br>
   1) The error catastrophe is a problem that exists in a stupid<br>
      oversimplified model of evolution, a non-problem, straw-man.<br>
   2) Kaufmann defines SO in such a way that it's the mirror-image of the<br>
      "problem" he's trying to solve: "complexity."  (He defines them both<br>
      as hierarchical structure, basically.)<br>
   3) He surprises himself by "solving" the "problem" with the "solution".<br>
   4) In At Home he sort of backs down and says SO is _complementary to_<br>
      selection, which is correct.  It's an important (but hard to avoid)<br>
      aspect of living things and how genes code that makes it possible<br>
      for them to keep evolving to more complex forms.<br>
<p>
I have to say, his work with "NK" networks and especially with the auto-<br>
catalytic set model of early evolution is way way cool.  Kaufmann is God.<br>
But not a writer.<br>
<p>
In TOOO, he both overhypes the main ideas and buries them in detail.<br>
<p>
In At Home he dilutes and sugars them unbelievably.  They guy is either<br>
condescending or a lune in the philosophy lobes.  But I got what I needed<br>
out of it and gave it back to the guy I borrowed it from.  TOOO stays on<br>
my shelf.<br>
