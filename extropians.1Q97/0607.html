<i>&gt;"Extropian" refers to a bunch of people, more rocket scientists than</i><br>
<i>&gt;cognitive scientists, who want to take over the Universe, improve their</i><br>
<i>&gt;bodies, and *occasionally* you will run into an Extropian who wants to</i><br>
<i>&gt;improve their minds.</i><br>
<p>
Well, that sure attracted comment!  Not so much by so many people, as by<br>
so many (2) Extropian heavyweights.  Which in itself is cause for<br>
comment; why did only the Extropian elite notice this statement?  But<br>
forget that.<br>
<p>
Grabbing my handy reference copy of "Great Mambo Chicken", we see that<br>
the ration of "rocket science" to "cognitive science" is, approximately,<br>
9 chapters to 0.<br>
<p>
Not that Ed Regis is your elite Extropian type; in fact, at the end of<br>
"Nano", he goes:  "So we master the world.  Then what?" without ever<br>
mentioning the Singularity, nor any of the people he interviewed<br>
mentioning it, and in fact going "I dunno."<br>
<p>
The point being, oh James Rogers, oh Max More, that you two are, as I<br>
said, the few Extropians who think about IA.  The rest are talking about<br>
rockets, cryonics, nanotechnology, thinking faster (but not better), and<br>
uploading... only to download into a physically omnipotent body and<br>
explore the Universe.  The Extropians as a group still retain that<br>
old-fashioned worldview that says that the Universe is out there, that<br>
we must go and subdue it, and that we do this with lightsails and Von<br>
Neumann machines and the accouterments of physical power.<br>
<p>
The most powerful humans on the planet, right now, are the computer<br>
programmers... the ones who accidentally stay up for 36 hours working in<br>
their private Universes.  No mortal command was ever so absolute.  And<br>
the most complex object, anywhere, is the human brain.  I would not<br>
hesitate to suggest that a single human brain contains more *complexity*<br>
than the entire Universe outside those lumps of grey matter.<br>
<p>
More:  Why not try sending out an official ExI poll to registered<br>
Extropian email addresses, asking them to:<br>
<p>
Rank these tenets of extropianism in order of personal<br>
time-spent-thinking-about:<br>
<p>
A) Nanotechnology        B) Singularity                C) Libertarianism<br>
D) Space travel          E) Intelligence amplification F) Internet<br>
G) Cryonics              H) Artificial intelligence<br>
I) Postbiological bodies J) Uploading   O) _____________________________<br>
<p>
Note that you do not rank the items in each column separately, and the<br>
ranking consists of a simple prioritization.  Leave off any items you<br>
never think about, or think are unnecessary.<br>
<p>
My results are EBAHJFC, or IA-SI-Nano-AI-Upload-Net-Libertarian<br>
