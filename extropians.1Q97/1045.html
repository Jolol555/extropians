Lyle wrote, regarding Eliezer's rant against Hugo de Garis:<br>
&lt; What fascinates me about this is that I wrote exactly the same thing <br>
when I was your age.  I was anti-racist and anti-sexist; I was every <br>
bit as strident, every bit as self-righteous, as you.  This behaviour <br>
has puzzled me ever since.&gt;<br>
<p>
Uh, WAS? Does this imply that you have seen the light in your wise old <br>
age and are now racist and sexist?<br>
<p>
I'm over 40 now but have yet to be enlightened as to why my gender, <br>
and especially my race, has anything to do with most of the things I'm <br>
concerned about.  The only thing I was self-righteous about as a young <br>
rebel was the desire to overthrow the establishment.  I still don't <br>
care much for 'the establishment' but no longer care about <br>
overthrowing it, simply because I've found my own niche and think the <br>
establishment will evolve as new technologies and concerns develop; <br>
or, at least, as the dead wood falls and new growth takes its <br>
place...<br>
<p>
However, if immortality is achieved, this cycle might be broken and <br>
there might be no natural churning of generations, less chance for <br>
cultural evolution as the Old Ones, set in their ways, maintain a grip <br>
on existing assets and culture.  Perhaps, then, the only way for new <br>
generations to establish themselves WOULD be by morphing into some new <br>
'race' or 'gender', some new clade, that would have to strike off into <br>
the cosmos to create its own niche.  In this case, they would be <br>
'cladist' by definition; but, that's certainly not the situation in <br>
our current world.<br>
