<i>&gt; &gt;You then form an infinite sum, adding each estimated future dividend</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;multiplied by the discount rate appropriate for that distance in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;future.  This gives you the total discounted future return for the stock,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and that, according to this model, would be the stock's value for you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Average this over all market participants and you get the stock price.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Now consider how this model works as we approach an era where industrial</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;production grows explosively, due to nanotech, or AI, or self-reproducing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cheap robots, or some other breakthrough. This can cause returns from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stock to begin increasing at a rapid rate, even faster than the discount</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;factor reduces them.  The result could be that the infinite sum above</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;diverges!  The stock will in fact, today, have an infinite value to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  This assumes the discount rate is unaffected by the explosive economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; growth. But what sane person would use a discount rate that is significantly</i><br>
<i>&gt; lower than the economic growth rate?</i><br>
<p>
I was using a different model of the discount rate, where it is a<br>
psychological measure of the pain inherent in postponing present<br>
gratification for future reward.  A dollar today is more fun than a<br>
dollar next year, and the degree to which this is true for you will<br>
determine your own personal discount rate.  People whose discount rates<br>
are higher than average (who hate waiting) will tend to be borrowers,<br>
and those with lower than average rates will tend to be lenders.<br>
<p>
It is true that this model does not obviously explain why discount rates<br>
tend to equal long term growth rates, so it might be more plausible to<br>
assume that they track each other.  But it is not clear to me how the<br>
existence of rapid growth will affect people's willingness to forego<br>
pleasures until tomorrow.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  It makes no sense to pay more for a stock than it would cost to</i><br>
<i>&gt; create a similar new company. While there some assets that can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; be quickly duplicated (Bill Gates' brain, Nabisco's reputation, etc),</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see how they can explain why people would pay orders of</i><br>
<i>&gt; magnitude more for stock shares than it would cost to start a</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar company.</i><br>
<p>
Good point.  By my reasoning this would suggest that people would expend<br>
resources to start new companies as well, until some limiting resource<br>
raised the cost of doing so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;This would not be a conventional speculative bubble, where people invest</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;just to get temporary gains from the ongoing price rises, but rather a</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The majority of people who buy near the peak of a bubble think they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are long term investors buying at the start of a new era (usually with</i><br>
<i>&gt; rationalizations like those in Lyle's parody).</i><br>
<p>
That may be true, but what I meant was that those people were wrong all<br>
those other times, and this time they would be right.  So it really is<br>
fundamentally different from a speculative bubble in actuality, even if<br>
it may appear superficially similar.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I would expect the financial explosion to occur a few years to perhaps a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;few decades before the productivity explosion, depending on how farsighted</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  What would cause the value of labor to decline relative to capital</i><br>
<i>&gt; years before the cost of duplicating human-level intelligence is</i><br>
<i>&gt; reduced?</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand what you are getting at here.  I argued that the<br>
value of productive investments is more than commonly recognized, and<br>
that eventually the value would therefore increase.  This would imply<br>
that the value of labor will decline relative to capital, not because<br>
labor is less valuable, but because capital would be more so.  To take<br>
an exaggerated example, spending your money on a robot which will build<br>
a million more for free would be better than spending it on a hairdresser.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  What would cause the value of cash and cash-like assets to decline?</i><br>
<i>&gt; One of the reasons that these assets have value is the ability they</i><br>
<i>&gt; provide to quickly move one's assets into new (unanticapted) investments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since my intuition is that the period you are talking about will</i><br>
<i>&gt; produce enormous uncertainties about which companies will produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; or benefit from breakthroughs in nanotech or AI, I expect I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; value cash fairly highly.</i><br>
<p>
Cash is not a productive asset, so to the extend you hold it you<br>
are foregoing the income that you could have made by investing it.<br>
If investments are growing much faster than today, then holding cash<br>
will be more costly.<br>
<p>
However you may be right that being able to move deftly into various<br>
investments will be important for some people.  Others will prefer to<br>
adopt a diversified position.  It's hard to say now how evenly the<br>
benefits from the new technologies will be spread.  However surely<br>
in the present day the argument implies that the best strategy is to<br>
invest productively so that you benefit from the future "catastrophe"<br>
(as in catastrophe theory, a sudden change to a new set of stable points).<br>
<p>
Thanks for your comments.  I am not really adhering to this theory, but I<br>
am interested in its plausibility.<br>
