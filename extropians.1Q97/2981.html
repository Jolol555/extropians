<i>&gt; feel a bit of this kind of altruism and protective instinct, seeing your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; DNA, born ( I assume a clone must have surrogate mothering- imagine if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; were it's mother, or your mate had carried it to term) and raised?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Would we take pride, watching it growing up and thriving? </i><br>
<p>
Sure its a copy but a bad one.. <br>
<p>
or<br>
<p>
It look like me but it NOT....<br>
<p>
If I had cancer and I wasn't sure ALcor et al will work.. it might<br>
want to "buy" a clone and leave him a piece of my estate...<br>
<p>
but if I wanted to leave a legacy I, PERSONALLY, speaking would rather<br>
leave money to soeone with the same MEME's rather than the same<br>
GENE's.<br>
<p>
e.g., rather leave money to a young and like minded Extropian than a<br>
newborn clone (or even adult clone) who might not see eye to eye,<br>
might be highly competitive w/ me or resentful of me, etc.<br>
