It is a common intellectual fallacy to take limited, specific, results<br>
in some field and extrapolate from them as if they were some fundamental<br>
law of nature.  Much the way new-age mystics leaped on Quantum mechanics<br>
to justify their ideas about consciousness creating reality.<br>
<p>
What Godel proved--yes, proved as in final answer--is that in a system<br>
of symbolic mathematics sufficiently powerful to express assertions of<br>
basic number theory, there must exist assertions which are true, but for<br>
which no proof exists in the system.  That is, the set "provable"  is a<br>
proper subset of the set "true".<br>
<p>
This result applies only to symbolic mathematics, not to reality.  To<br>
claim from it that "truth" is therefore unattainable is like saying<br>
"my car won't start, therefore travel is impossible".<br>
