Hmm. If Anders says that, then there must be something to it. Being a <br>
nit-picker: what are the prerequisites for QC? Hyperprecise structures<br>
(molecular manufacturing)? Ultradeep temperatures (nanokelvins and below)?<br>
Weird states of matter (like EBC &amp;c)? Appropriate timing (full moon)?<br>

Well, if we have solved the iPFP, the molecular CAM is basically done.<br>
The circuitry components are already there, all we need it to tailor the<br>
proteins and to debug the autoassembly.<br>

<p>
QAI, by ANN, by QC? I dunno.<br>
 <br>

<p>
I think the "can't" sounds more plausible. If it was (has been) possible, <br>
we're living in a mockup. Newway's noncooperation assuming, the Cellticks <br>
are doomed to a Life sentence.<br>
 <br>

Insider knowledge? Beware, Anders' evil experiment has transcended!<br>
