4A. "Systems and States": In _Life Itself_, Robert Rosen notes: "There<br>
is indeed a profound parallel between Newtonian particle mechanics and<br>
the pure syntax of formalizations; in each case, everything is supposed<br>
to be generated from structureless, meaningless elements ... pushed<br>
around according to definite rules ... In each case, all that ultimately<br>
matters is the spatial disposition of these elements, their<br>
configuration... The sequence of state transitions of a system of<br>
particles, governed by Newton's laws of motion, starting from some given<br>
initial configuration, is then the analog of a theorem in a formalism."<br>
<p>
"And just as formalization in mathematics believed that everything could<br>
be formalized /without loss/, so that all truth could be recaptured in<br>
terms of syntax alone, so particle mechanics came to believe that every<br>
material behavior could be ... reduced to purely syntactical sequences<br>
of configurations in an underlying system of particles.... the form<br>
taken by mechanical description ... has become the universal currency<br>
for describing systems of any kind."<br>
<p>
4B. "Chronicles." Rosen says: "I will begin by stepping back a bit, by<br>
supposing that we do not yet have a notion of state at our disposal....<br>
All the self can see is a sequence of percepts, ordered by its<br>
subjective sense of time.... Thus, the result of the self looking at its<br>
ambience is only a tabulation; a list of what is seen, indexed by when<br>
it is seen. Such a list we shall call a /chronicle/." <br>
<p>
"But the self is not merely an observer.... So, along with any time<br>
series ... comes the urge to extend it into the future and into the<br>
past, to extrapolate it, to predict and postdict ... we seek to extract<br>
from the structure of the list itself something that will already entail<br>
those entries that are yet to come or those that have come before." But,<br>
Rosen notes, "all it can find this way are properties of the list, and<br>
not in general of what the list represents." Such context-free samples<br>
are doomed to "lose information precisely because they are samples, and<br>
they also add irrelevant information (noise), which pertains to the<br>
sampling process itself." (p70)<br>
<p>
4C. "Recursive Chronicles." Showing that "there are an infinite number<br>
of different formulas that will all produce the given chronicle", Rosen<br>
concludes that "a list thus /can never entail a formula/. The reason<br>
being that "in the present case, the independent variable (instants) is<br>
simply a set of labels, unconnected causally or in any other way with<br>
the values of f(n) that they label.... What we do want is ... entailment<br>
between the /values/ f(n), and in fact, we want entailment that does not<br>
involve the independent variable n at all ... what we earlier called<br>
/contagion/."<br>
<p>
4D. "Recursion: Some General Features". Rosen looks at a few examples of<br>
recursive chronicles and the mapping, T, and its iterates that generate<br>
them, mentioning groups, trajectories and orbits. Rosen notes that these<br>
functions have many nice properties as long as they are invertible. Then<br>
he concludes: "causality manifests itself /only/ through a sequence of<br>
state transitions ... this is the basic picture that permeates all of<br>
contemporary science. If there is something wrong with the picture, or<br>
especially if there is something missing from it, then the root of the<br>
trouble lies already here."<br>
<p>
01/26/97. 4E. "On Taylor's Theorem", 4F. "Recursion and Constraints",<br>
and 4G. "Coping With Nonrecursiveness: Recursion and Constraint in Sets<br>
of Chronicles" covers 12 pages of mathematical technicalities that<br>
basically describe how Taylor's theorem [ f(t0 + h) = f(t0) + hf'(t0) +<br>
(h^2/2!)f"(t0) + .... ] "provides a glimpse at how we can make a<br>
chronicle, which is itself not recursive, act as if it were by embedding<br>
it in a larger set of chronicles." These are the successive velocity,<br>
acceleration, etc. derivatives used in differential equations "to<br>
convert synchronic information ... into diachronic information."<br>
<p>
4H. "Newton's Laws". Rosen declares: "As I shall now show, Newton's laws<br>
are at heart nothing but Taylor's theorem, raised now to a universal<br>
principle via tacit but extremely restrictive limitations on encoding<br>
and decoding of events in the ambience."<br>
<p>
"It cannot be stressed too strongly that the Newtonian particle is a<br>
/formal object/.... Aside from the parameters with which it is endowed<br>
(e.g., its mass) ... its /only/ attribute at any instant is its position<br>
in space. Thus, there is only one question to ask about it: namely,<br>
where is it? The answers constitute a chronicle, consisting of positions<br>
in space, labeled by corresponding instants of time.... The upshot is<br>
that, although indeed a (differentiable) function entails its own<br>
derivative /as a function/, its /value/ at any instant entails nothing<br>
about the value of the derivatives at that instant."<br>
<p>
"So far we have been looking at the single particle that constitutes our<br>
(natural) system. Let us now notice that the same act that singled out<br>
that particle from the ambience also /simultaneously/ specifies the<br>
system environment.... But if the state of an individual particle is at<br>
this point already an infinite object, to try to characterize a 'state'<br>
of this environment is literally unthinkable. Newton did not even<br>
attempt this. Instead, he took a completely different approach, embodied<br>
in the concept of /force/. The environment was to be characterized ...<br>
entirely through its effects on the system. Specifically, we<br>
characterize the environment of a particle through its effect on change<br>
of state."<br>
<p>
"Newton chose an ingenious device ... he noted that /at the purely<br>
formal level/, and /only/ at that level, we are free to make the<br>
environment of a Newtonian particle anything we want.... The substance<br>
of Newton's First Law is to specify what a particle does in such an<br>
empty environment. He mandated that such a particle cannot<br>
accelerate.... In a formal environment that is not empty, and is thus<br>
the seat of /forces/ impinging on the particle, the effects of these<br>
forces on the motion of the particle is thus tied to its acceleration. <br>
<p>
The way in which force and acceleration are explicitly tied together<br>
constitutes Newton's Second Law, which consists of two separate parts.<br>
In the first part ... Newton mandates that the effect of any environment<br>
forces on a particle, at any instant, are proportional to the particle's<br>
acceleration at that instant ... The second part of Newton's Second Law<br>
says essentially [that] from the particle's point of view, any forces F<br>
it experiences from its environment /are already functions of its own<br>
states/ ... The upshot of Newton's Second Law is to effectively collapse<br>
the state of the particle, which is an infinite set of variables, /down<br>
to only two/ of them, down to position and velocity alone."<br>
<p>
"Newton's Laws thus serve to transmute the initial dualism between<br>
system and environment into a new dualism, that between /phase (states<br>
and forces/, or between /states and dynamical laws.... in the Newtonian<br>
picture, a particle is shoved from one state to another through the<br>
external agencies to which it must react. But when we go to systems of<br>
several formal particles, the situation is different. Each particle<br>
forms part of the environments of all the others." "This", Rosen says,<br>
"requires a new ingredient ... Hence, the separate stipulation of, for<br>
example, the Law of Universal Gravitation..." Rosen concludes: "just as<br>
in the single-particle case, the system-environment dualism becomes<br>
transmuted into a dualism between phases and forces. It is a little more<br>
complicated now ... the recursion rules governing change of states or<br>
phases of the system become /relative/ ... additional chronicles must be<br>
stipulated which pertain to the environment."<br>
<p>
02/08/97. 4I. "On Entailment in Physics: Cause &amp; Effect". Rosen seeks to<br>
show that "Newtonian mechanics as a formalism manifests a surprisingly<br>
weak inferential structure" that also restricts any causal entailments<br>
that may be derived from it. He examines how Newton's Second Law says<br>
that "the way in which acceleration depends on phase is a measure of the<br>
force impressed on the particles of a system by its environment" and,<br>
thus, "the relations themselves constitute an encoding of environment<br>
and not system. Thus, in the Newtonian picture, systems get states;<br>
environments do not (and cannot); environments rather become identified<br>
with dynamical laws."<br>
<p>
"This is a fateful situation ... we have automatically placed beyond the<br>
province of causality anything that does not encode directly into a<br>
state-transition sequence. Such things have become /acausal/, out of the<br>
reach of entailment in the formalism, and hence /in principle<br>
undecodable/ from the formalism." (p102) From this, Rosen declares: "I<br>
shall define a natural system N to be a mechanism if it possesses the<br>
properties I have just articulated: namely, (1) it has a largest model,<br>
consisting of a set of states, and a recursion rule entailing subsequent<br>
state from present state; and (2) every other model of it can be<br>
obtained from the largest one by formal means."<br>
<p>
4J. "Quantum Mechanics, Open Systems, and Related Matters", Rosen claims<br>
that "until the advent of quantum ideas, physicists did not in fact<br>
think much about causality." He even quotes Bertrand Russell as stating:<br>
"The reason why physics has ceased to look for causes is that, in fact,<br>
there are no such things." The problem, Rosen says, is that "the<br>
Heisenberg commutation relations said that classical phase could no<br>
longer even be defined at the quantum level, let alone be recursive.<br>
But, as was quickly realized, giving up the notion of phase did not mean<br>
giving up the notion of state. It merely required an encoding of that<br>
notion into a more complicated mathematical or formal object (wave<br>
function) ... governed now by Schrodinger's equation (or its<br>
equivalents) rather than by Newton's Second Law." <br>
<p>
The key point for Rosen here is that "the new encoding ... of wave<br>
functions ... could be related only in a statistical way to the old,<br>
classical encoding". Rosen then notes that Newtonian mechanics does not<br>
deal well with open systems, those where there is "turnover" in the<br>
'particles' inhabiting a "distinguished region of space". In open<br>
systems, as in quantum systems, he continues, "the 'state' was now to be<br>
a density of some kind, and the 'velocity', or rate of change of state,<br>
was now specified, not in terms of force, but solely by bookkeeping ...<br>
the difficulty is precisely in assigning to such a situation a notion of<br>
state that is recursive.... In every case, the strategy is then to<br>
regard the 'open system' as an underlying closed system /plus<br>
something/." Rosen concludes this section (p 107) by warning that "it is<br>
precisely in recoding the concept of state that the transition from<br>
classical to quantum mechanics manifests itself."<br>

Rosen is leading up to a discussion of  relational biology in ch.5 and<br>
Analytic and Synthetic Models in ch.6)<br>
