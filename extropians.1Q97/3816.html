Lee makes a lot of good suggestions regarding alternatives to intellectual<br>
property laws.  In the last issue of Scientific American, there was an<br>
article on "trusted computers".  Contrary to what you might expect, these<br>
aren't computers that you trust - they are computers which you own but which<br>
are trusted by other people!  The computer works for somebody else, not for<br>
you.<br>
<p>
The idea is that you load some software (or a book, video, etc.) into the<br>
computer and it lets you run it, but it won't let you copy it to anybody<br>
else.  Or, you can loan it out but when you do you don't have it any more.<br>
<p>
I don't really find this a very appealing idea, but of course if people<br>
want to try it and see if it works in the market, that's fine.<br>
<p>
The thing that struck me though was that the article was focusing on the<br>
problems with protecting intellectual property in the computer age.  Books,<br>
videos, music, etc., all could be shared for free.  The implication was<br>
that without these mini-big-brothers (little brothers?) to keep people<br>
honest, the whole publishing industry would disappear.<br>
<p>
The glaring omission from the discussion was the software business.  They<br>
have been dealing with this problem on a large scale for almost 20 years.<br>
They don't have trusted computers; most software these days doesn't even<br>
have copy protection (although of course the advent of CD-ROMs has made<br>
it harder to make lots of copies).  By the reasoning of the article, the<br>
software business should be an endangered species.<br>
<p>
I think that's why they didn't mention it - it is such an obvious<br>
exception to their reasoning that it would have undercut a lot of what<br>
they were trying to say.  So they hoped people wouldn't notice.<br>
<p>
Even with IP laws widely ignored, and even with the ease of copying<br>
software, we still have a thriving software business.  Shelves groan<br>
under the weight of new titles.  Of course there are losses due to<br>
unauthorized copying.  But that hasn't stopped the business as a whole<br>
from being fantastically successful.  There's no reason the same thing<br>
shouldn't happen with other digital media.<br>
