<i>&gt; The venus post is interesting because it measures women's sexuality </i><br>
<i>&gt; against men's math abilities.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I wasn't thinking in terms of "measuring against"... <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My answer would be, you perceive a kind of power she holds, </i><br>
<i>&gt; which is at least as influential as math, or any of the traditional </i><br>
<i>&gt; male domains.  </i><br>
<p>
Almost true. Venus (maybe we should say Frigga, in view of J's nordic <br>
background) has as much power as Hermes, Vulcan (her husband), etc.  <br>
She yields to Jove, however, and how she stacks up against YHWH is <br>
another matter entirely.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If she did math well, she would still have that power...  </i><br>
<p>
She already did math well, on an elementary level.  But that's not <br>
what it means to be a mathematician.  What if she were as obsessed <br>
with math as you are with art?  She would have to reorganize her mind <br>
at a very fundamental level, and it would change her feminine psyche <br>
into something else.  <br>
<p>
You have seen the Newtonian side of my personality come out a few <br>
times.  You're right, I can be abusive.  You don't know the half of it...  <br>
Can you imagine a woman with a Newtonian personality?  She might <br>
be beautiful, in a way, but she would be Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS.  <br>
She might have power, but not the same power Jennifer had.  <br>
<p>
To be a mathematician, you have to form the habit of cutting through <br>
the bullshit and getting to the point.  I use the word "cut" advisedly.  <br>
It's a masculine idea.  Cut.  You do it with a sword.  Even the gentlest <br>
mathematician (most of them are much nicer than Newton) always has <br>
that sword, and at any moment his eyes may flash and cut right through <br>
you.  Jennifer could have learned to do that, but she couldn't do that <br>
and still be the magical creature that she was.  Lady MacBeth is not <br>
Venus.  <br>
<p>
David Viscott wrote a book about his experience as a medical student.  <br>
I gave the book away years ago, and can't even remember the title, but <br>
I remember an incident that illustrates what I'm trying to say:  He went <br>
