The Washington Post reported today (March 2, 1997) that Don Wolf of the <br>
Oregon Regional Primate Center has cloned monkeys from embryo cells using  <br>
techniques similar to the ones that resulted in a cloning sheep, the animals   <br>
were born last August. Dr. Wolf said that is as far as he intends to go, <br>
he did not try to make a clone from an adult monkey, nor does he intend to, <br>
it's not too hard to figure out why, in the next sentence the article says <br>
that his work is federally funded. <br>
<p>
The Journal "Nature" said they were under considerable pressure not to  <br>
publish the historic article on cloning, right up to the moment the presses <br>
rolled attempts were made to suppress it. Fortunately Nature has guts and did  <br>
not cave in, they even put the entire article on the Web, you can read it at <br>
<a href="http://www.nature.com./">http://www.nature.com./</a><br>
<p>
Our old friend Jeremy Rifkin said there should be an immediate worldwide ban <br>
on cloning and that the penalty for violation should "be on a par with murder". <br>
A poll taken by ABC news says that 87% of Americans think cloning should be <br>
banned, 6% would like to be cloned.<br>
<p>
I'm not too worried because I think it's politicians not Scientists who are  <br>
guilty of hubris if they think they can stop this technology. For the first <br>
time I found something that an "ethicist", the lowest form of human life,  <br>
said that I could agree with; to quote Ronald Munson, "The technology is not,  <br>
in principle policeable [...] These are relatively standard labs. That's the <br>
amazing thing about biotechnology. It's fundamentally quite feasible". <br>
Unlike Munson I am not appalled by this, I am  delighted.<br>
