<i>&gt; Like sacking all the managers? I've found they're almost always the last</i><br>

<p>
Remember the Dilbert Principle: incompetent employees are routinely<br>
promoted to a position where they can do the least damage: management.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Also price isn't the the most important factor when it comes to selecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; who you hire.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True. But small companies also respond much faster. In one of my jobs the</i><br>
<i>&gt; company grew from small to large in the time I worked there. When we were</i><br>
<i>&gt; small a customer would report a bug in the software and I'd often fix it</i><br>
<i>&gt; and mail out a new version the same working day. By the time I left we had</i><br>
<i>&gt; to submit any new software version for extensive testing, which took days</i><br>
<i>&gt; to weeks. Sure, we occasionally introduced new bugs but customers were</i><br>
<i>&gt; happier to get a version with a new bug that was fixed the next day than</i><br>
<i>&gt; to wait a week for us to test it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Would you put your company's future in the hand of a one man corp where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; owner can loose his ability to work form day to day?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The same could happen with a large company that only puts one person to</i><br>
<i>&gt; work on your project. For another person to take over a complicated</i><br>
<i>&gt; software project could take days.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Would you put your company in the hands of a group of unaccountable<br>
people who are not dependent on doing a real days work in order to get a<br>
paycheck? A small businessperson works hard because they know they are<br>
the only ones capable of creating their success.<br>
