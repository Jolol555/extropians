There's something I don't understand about all the excitement over push.<br>
It seems to me that the push concept conflates two relatively independent<br>
ideas: content filtering, and when-available delivery.<br>
<p>
Content filtering is what lets you select what you are going to see.<br>
That's what we have now when you do a web search on a topic, or when you<br>
bookmark a web page which serves as an index or entry into a subject of<br>
interest.  This is definately a good thing, but existing technologies leave<br>
a lot to be desired.  I have a hard time finding all the information I want<br>
on the web (but the web is still orders of magnitude better than any other<br>
alternative I have used, primarily libraries).<br>
<p>
When-available delivery provides you information as it happens.  This sounds<br>
great for sports scores or the latest business news.  Lots of stuff happening<br>
there.  But it's not clear to me that it applies that well to topics beyond<br>
the most superficial popular subjects.  Most areas that I am interested in<br>
don't have that much progress.  Maybe a new paper gets published every few<br>
weeks or months that is really interesting or important.<br>
<p>
What worries me is that it is just going to be TV all over again -<br>
the lowest common denominator.  Those areas which work best with push<br>
are going to be the ones where information dribbles out all the time -<br>
corporate press releases, soap operas, headline news, the stock market<br>
ticker, the same old garbage.  That's not what I go to the web for.<br>
The web is an infinite library, holding all kinds of information.<br>
<p>
The real problem is not in getting the information delivered, it is in<br>
finding it.  Once I've found a web page that provides a reasonably complete<br>
overview of a field, with lots of other links to relevant pages, then I<br>
have a good source.  Yes, it would be useful to be notified when the links<br>
change or some new information is provided.  Push does have a place there.<br>
But it's not going to revolutionize my usage of the web, unless the web is<br>
just going to turn into TV.<br>
