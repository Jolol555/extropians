Gregory Houston wrote 2/14/97: &lt;One day, one of the entities might just<br>
develop its offenseive technology faster than the other entity develops its<br>
defensive technology. At this point the *stronger* offensive country has<br>
control to either manipulate or destroy the other country.&gt;<br>
<p>
It's called adapting in a co-evolutionary environment, survival of the<br>
fittest.  Are you wishing away the physical laws of evolution?  Wow, I'm<br>
impressed with what you can do once you've chucked truth out the window.<br>
<p>
&lt;Violence is perpetuated by an appreciation or desire for violence.&gt;<br>
<p>
You move through life, from conception to death, appropriating space and<br>
time, energy and matter from the living entities in your environment.  You<br>
are violently appropriating these all the time, whether or not you have the<br>
capacity to appreciate or desire such violent appropriation.  This is the<br>
truth.  If you jettison truth, I guess you can usefully delude yourself<br>
that you have not been committing acts of violence all your life against<br>
other living entities, whether you knew you were or not.  Your violent<br>
appropriations from other humans may be from unintended consequences, from<br>
indirect "externalities," from studied ignorance, but they are very real. <br>
You can try to define this aspect of life away, but you will not change the<br>
reality of it.  What right do you have to exist at all, where did it come<br>
from?<br>
<p>
Again, I see here a utopian dream to revoke evolutionary laws.  One of the<br>
best descriptions of evolution I have seen, is a famous passage by Joseph<br>
de Maistre from his book "Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg":<br>
<p>
  "In the whole vast dome of living nature there reigns an open violence, a<br>
kind a prescriptive fury which arms all the creatures to their common doom:<br>
 as soon as you leave the inanimate kingdom you find the decree of violent<br>
death inscribed on the very frontiers of life.  Over all these numerous<br>
races of animals man is placed, and his destructive hand spares nothing<br>
that lives.  He kills to obtain food and he kills to clothe himself; he<br>
kills to adorn himself; he kills in order to attack and he kills to defend<br>
himself; he kills to instruct himself and he kills to amuse himself; he<br>
kills to kill.  Proud and terrible king, he wants everything and nothing<br>
resists him  his table is covered with corpses   And who [in the general<br>
carnage] will exterminate him who exterminates all the others?  Himself. <br>
It is man who is charged with the slaughter of man   So is accomplished <br>
the great law of the violent destruction of living creatures.  The whole<br>
earth, perpetually steeped in blood, is nothing but a vast altar upon which<br>
all that is living must be sacrificed without end, without measure, without<br>
pause, until the consummation of things, until evil is extinct, until the<br>
death of death."<br>
<p>
I suspect this view of evolution is uncomfortable for you.  It is far<br>
easier to indulge in psycho-babble to divert attention from how things<br>
really work.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Gregory has whined utopically about how bad it is to develop violent<br>
technology:&gt;<br>
<p>
Gregory: &lt;The above sounds more like a personal and verbally *violent*<br>
attack than it does a rational argument.&gt;<br>
<p>
If you view the truth to be committing violence, and you dislike violence,<br>
no wonder you dislike truth.<br>
<p>
&lt;...that person may not be able to keep that resolution do to the force of<br>
underlying, unquestioned, subconscious emotions.&gt;<br>
<p>
Modern neuroscience, particularly in the nineties, has pretty much done<br>
away with the last disreputable vestiges of this Freudian propaganda.<br>
<p>
&lt;If we ignore [emotions] then they control us without our being aware of<br>
it. Deny it and you remain naive and determined.&gt;<br>
<p>
Our emotions don't make us robots, they make us human.  Your distaste for<br>
truth again shows itself by inverting reality.  Trust your emotions, give<br>
yourself a break.  Just because people have claimed that eating Twinkies<br>
caused them to commit heinous criminal acts doesn't mean they can escape<br>
responsibility for their actions.<br>
<p>
&lt;This need to show others that we are stronger is caused by excess dopamine<br>
in the central nervous system.  It is primitive.&gt;<br>
<p>
Sheesh, what do I know, huh?  Here I thought it was a fiendishly complex<br>
adaptive evolutionary strategy to survive.  The world is so much simpler<br>
when that pesky truth isn't hanging around being such a wet blanket.<br>
<p>
&lt;Look at our entertainment industry. It is fueled by our appreciation of<br>
violence.&gt;<br>
<p>
It is fueled by dumping truth in favor of utility.  Violence has great<br>
utility for the barbarians of today who have grown up spoon-fed a steady<br>
diet of your brand of relativism.<br>
<p>
&lt;Well, perhaps you should check where some of your violent urges come<br>
from.&gt;<br>
<p>
Physician, heal thyself.<br>
<p>
&lt;I believe the desire to do violence is a projection upon others one's<br>
desire to have violence done to him/herself.&gt;<br>
<p>
Get a refund from your Psych 101 class.<br>
<p>
&lt;People have violent urges when they feel insecure.&gt;<br>
<p>
There are a lot of elderly individuals who feel insecure in their own<br>
neighborhoods because of the roving barbaric thugs, steeped in relativism<br>
and chock full of self-esteem, outside their doors.  Do the insecure<br>
elderly in this situation have violent urges?  Is it these raging grannies<br>
we need to slip an emotive education to?<br>
<p>
&lt;It comes from within when a person is unappreciative of themself, when<br>
they feel inadequate, unable to consciously bare the feeling that they want<br>
to die, they will often express this in violent thought, or the<br>
appreciation of violence in entertainment, and when taken to the extreme<br>
they will commit actual acts of violence.&gt;<br>
<p>
Are you getting this from "Psychology Today"?  Barney the Dinosaur?  The<br>
Ricki Lake Show?<br>
<p>
&lt;From without it comes when one is threatened by the other, but if one<br>
breaks down emotively and thus rationally and chooses to persist in playing<br>
the violent game with the other, then that fear and paranoia will be<br>
cultivated. If we did not always react to insecure feelings with immidiate<br>
violent feelings, then we might just be able to use that same reactive<br>
mental energy to focus on creating *progressive* non-violent alternatives.&gt;<br>
<p>
Do you mean like "Love your neighbor" and "Turn the other cheek"?  How<br>
novel.<br>
