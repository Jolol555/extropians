<i>&gt; &lt; What fascinates me about this is that I wrote exactly the same thing </i><br>
<i>&gt; when I was your age.  I was anti-racist and anti-sexist; I was every </i><br>
<i>&gt; bit as strident, every bit as self-righteous, as you.  This behaviour </i><br>
<i>&gt; has puzzled me ever since.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Uh, WAS? Does this imply that you have seen the light in your wise old </i><br>
<i>&gt; age and are now racist and sexist?</i><br>
<p>
My guess is that he is now non-sexist and non-racist rather than anti-<br>
sexist and anti-racist.  Indeed, the latter are contradictory: to be<br>
anti-racist, it is necessary to group people by race, evaluate the<br>
conditions of each group /as a group/, and attempt to equalize those<br>
conditions /as a group/.  A non-racist on the other hand simply treats<br>
individuals as individuals.  He may of course notice correlations<br>
between certain attributes of individuals and attitudes towards them,<br>
and work to dispel those irrational attitudes, but he does not buy<br>
into their premise himself in order to oppose it.<br>
