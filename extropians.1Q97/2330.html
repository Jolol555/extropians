Your ideas are much clearer to me than they were before, and this time i<br>
actually agreed with 90% of what you had to argument, the remaining 10%, i<br>
don't value high enough to keep argueing them for arguments sake.<br>
<p>
Sometimes ideas only make a system work, when combined with other ideas. I<br>
wasn't sure about which other ideas, you intended to combine with the ones<br>
you already mentioned. Even if i had read Friedman and Hayek, i'm sure i<br>
would have asked some of the same questions, in a less naive way probably,<br>
but still political 'basics' leave a lot of room for individual differences.<br>
<p>
I will start reading 'the basics'.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry my reaction is so short, but i have the flu, and a fever that is<br>
frying my brain. I will catch up with the rest of list as soon as my<br>
temperature is down...<br>
