This is great. I have a suggestion. Imagine a ticker tape cgi program<br>
that the user can customize at some particular webpage by entering<br>
fields of interests, people of interest, business's and organizations of<br>
interest, etcetera. The ticker tape would then be constantly updated<br>
with information regarding late breaking news on these subjects.<br>
Clicking on the subject in the ticker tape would take you to that<br>
information. Once the ticker tape has been defined, the person can put<br>
it at the top of their home page so that every time they log on its<br>
immiediately accessed. Putting the ticker tape on the home page would be<br>
done in the same way many people put counters on their homepages by<br>
accessing the cgi program on other servers, in this case the server<br>
running the ticker tape. Then specialized sites could use this ticker<br>
tape on their web pages also by defining the subjects of interest for<br>
that site specifically. A nanotechnology site for instance would have a<br>
ticker tape at the top [or elsewhere] with late breaking news dealing<br>
with nanotechnology and related science. New news would knock off old<br>
news so that even if there hasn't been anything new, there will still be<br>
a set number of ticker tape items scrolling across this small and<br>
unobtrusive html embedded cgi object. <br>
<p>
I would suggest a hyperlinked table of contents on your essay for ease<br>
of reference.<br>
<p>
I am particularly intrested in microcosmic automated collaborative<br>
filtering (ATF). How can I apply this emerging technology within my<br>
website as well as beyond it? <br>
<p>
In the essay, located in the URL of your sig text, it said,<br>
"Explanations of the workings of the technology and<br>
analysis of the current market are not my purpose here [...]". I would<br>
be interested in an article that did delve into the technology a bit.<br>
I'd like to know how this is to be implemented. Will it be in the<br>
browser, or will it be cgi, or something else. Again, I would like to<br>
see how I could use perhaps stripped down, stream-lined, less complex<br>
ATFs on my own site. Something easily implented using JavaScript, CGI,<br>
or ActiveX.<br>
<p>
"The problem here is that while machines store and pass messages, they<br>
do not know what to store and where to pass it. So,<br>
they process everything." [ATF article]<br>
<p>
This topic is covered a great deal in the IBM Systems Journal Vol. 35,<br>
Nos 3&amp;4, 1996. This particular issue of the journal is focused on the<br>
MIT Media Lab. A highly recommended read. <br>
<p>
<p>
"Some caveats exist here as well. If a people's expertise and tastes in<br>
some area are underdeveloped, a straightforward ACF system might provide<br>
them with the advice of their "laggard" affinity group that may give<br>
them support but not help in developing beyond their current level."<br>
[ATF article]<br>
<p>
Wonderful. This would be particularly useful for personalized online<br>
education [which one day might usurp traditional public education], and<br>
for Elists such as this which cover such varied topics. You mention<br>
"support but not help" here, but I think such a system could be<br>
assimilated into a personalized school curriculum so that the individual<br>
could attain degrees of both. In such a system the human teachers role<br>
becomes referential rather than authoritarian. Student phone call or<br>
email to teacher: "I have studied such and such information that my ATF<br>
has recommended yet I still am unable to understand this concept. Could<br>
you please help me." The ATF might even recommend someone to else to<br>
contact within the instituition, perhaps beyond it, who is more<br>
knowlegeable in this topic than the teacher/advisor.<br>
<p>
<p>
"The applications mentioned above move beyond mere information<br>
filtering." [ATF article]<br>
<p>
I tend to bring up issues involving the emotions and the subconscious as<br>
often as I can. In this case I think it might be interesting if<br>
personalized real-time memetic engineered subliminals might be added to<br>
a person's content based on their preferences, restrictions, habits, and<br>
aspirations. This would broaden the relevant effectual/affectual range<br>
of particular ATFs. ATFs already nudge us towards information at the<br>
conscious level, why not take it a step further so that they nudge and<br>
even help motivate us towards information and particular modalities of<br>
consciousness. <br>
