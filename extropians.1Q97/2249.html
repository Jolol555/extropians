           <br>
<p>
All definitions, IF that's the only information you had, would be circular. <br>
A dictionary would just say that one squiggle is equal to another squiggle <br>
and that squiggle is equal to yet another squiggle in the same book. <br>
You would not learn one thing about our world or the humans who inhabit it. <br>
In the real Physical world dictionaries are useful because Lexicographers<br>
know there is a lot of information that all their readers have in common that <br>
is not in any book. <br>
<p>
If I am frowning and have tears in my eyes and say "I am sad" then you don't <br>
need any book to have some idea of what I am feeling. If you then read that<br>
"happy is the opposite of sad" then you understand in a deep way what "happy" <br>
means, it is no longer just a squiggle, it is a symbol with meaning.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;how is my definition of "definition"  circular, as opposed to our         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;discussion of it? </i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
"Definition of definition" has a circularity in addition to the one I <br>
discussed above. If you asked me for the definition of something I know <br>
about, I may not be able to give an answer that would satisfy a rigorous <br>
Philosopher, but the man on the street would probably say it was OK. If you <br>
said "Give me a definition of frizbaum" I'd  say "I can't" I'd know what you <br>
wanted me to do I'd just be unable to do it.  If I didn't know what a<br>
definition was and you said "Give me a definition of definition" I'd say <br>
nothing because your vocalization  would be as meaningless as a burp, <br>
just a noise you made with your mouth.<br>
<p>
