Eugene is correct.  High purity is rare in street amphetamines and MDMA.<br>
The types and quanitities of impurities vary widely depending on the source<br>
of the base chemicals and synthesis process.  The output on a chromatograph<br>
is usually quite noisy.  The primary culprits are 1) Poor temperature<br>
regulation during synthesis, and 2) low quality base materials.  I have<br>
heard stories of people using things like formaldehyde that has been<br>
previously used to preserve biological specimens, and fingernail polish<br>
remover as a source of acetone.  Neither of these sources is pure base<br>
chemical, nor are the base chemicals they contain particularly pure to begin<br>
with anyway.<br>
<p>
Many of the impurities found in the MDMA/amphetamine class of drugs are<br>
neuroactive/neurotoxic in some manner and almost invariably can result in<br>
cumulative neurological damage.  In the long run, use of "street"<br>
amphetamines results in non-trivial damage to the central nervous system and<br>
liver.<br>

<p>
The only biological damage I am aware of for pure MDMA is to the liver<br>
(which is  common for many types of drugs).<br>
