I can see that you'd want to take issue with the notion that one<br>
can "engineer" one's values. But I think that if a brainwasher can,<br>
given appropriate control over another person's environment, change<br>
that person's values, then each of us can make deliberate changes<br>
in our own values through self-conditioning. Wanting to have no<br>
desire to smoke tobacco and having no desire to smoke tobacco are<br>
two different things, and I think someone in the first state can,<br>
through deliberate action, transform emself into the second state.<br>
I think this would qualify as a small but deliberate transformation<br>
of one's values. I think larger scale transformations are also<br>
possible.<br>

<p>
I'm sure they're not so crudely organized, and given the actual<br>
complexity of human minds, it's not hard for me to see how I could<br>
have a value which actually shapes my immediate actions now (i. e.<br>
"has much influence"), and yet manage to dump that value through<br>
longer-term changes in my own environment and my own behavior.<br>

<p>
One of my points is that it's not just one level, nor even just<br>
two levels. There are meta-meta-values above the meta-values. And<br>
even here there's an implicit assumption that the system is<br>
hierarchical, whereas the little bit we know about the brain might<br>
