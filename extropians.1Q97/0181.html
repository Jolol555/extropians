In a message dated 97-01-04 12:16:29 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 (Oh and puh-leeze don't give me any of that "But what sort of music is<br>
 it if you need to take drugs to get into it?" shit.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, that's exactly what I was thinking! Why would I pollute my mind for<br>
something as dumb as that? What a waste of time....<br>
IMO, if one get into any music without drugs as a prereq - it can only be<br>
doomed to failure in the long run,since using drugs ( specially E and Acid)<br>
usually have nasty effects on the brain over time. Especially if I had to<br>
take it every time i got into music!!!<br>
I dont take a single drug that will damage this precious brain of mine and<br>
maybe thats why repetitious music is only good for a short time thing for me,<br>
for background. For enjoying optimally,  i like more thoughtful music.<br>
You are limiting techno in a totally superficial way. <br>
I love to paint to techno beats, it's not drugs, it's rhythm.<br>
