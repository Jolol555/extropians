Could this be more in-line with my thesis that the elite,<br>
of which Clinton (CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg)<br>
is a servant, would move to prohibit open access to cloning<br>
technologies? They'll probably allow private research into<br>
animal cloning, as the CIA allowed and even funded private<br>
research on LSD, so as to accelerate the discovery process,<br>
but as soon as they've got it nailed down, they'll slam the<br>
door on freedom of self-replication and cloning technologies, <br>
reserving such only for the elite and their objectives:<br>

        Clinton limits study of cloning While backing animal <br>
        research, he banned federal dollars for study on<br>
        humans. He urged private firms to agree. <br>
<p>
        WASHINGTON -- Warning against the temptation ``to play God,'' <br>
        President Clinton yesterday banned federal funding of human-<br>
        cloning research and asked privately funded scientists to <br>
        halt such work until a national bioethics commission reviews <br>
        what he called ``troubling'' legal and ethical implications.  <br>
<p>
        ``Each human life is unique, born of a miracle that reaches <br>
        beyond laboratory science,'' Clinton said during a brief <br>
        ceremony in the Oval Office, where he announced his executive <br>
        directive. ``I believe we must respect this profound gift and <br>
        resist the temptation to replicate ourselves.''<br>
<p>
        The President's order, effective immediately, comes 10 days <br>
        after Scottish scientists reported they had cloned a sheep <br>
        named Dolly from adult cells and two days after researchers <br>
        in Oregon revealed they had bred a pair of rhesus monkeys <br>
        from cloned embryo cells. ...<br>
