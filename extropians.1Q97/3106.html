<i>&gt;HIV is always present and highly active in the lymph nodes of infected</i><br>
<i>&gt;patients for the entire course of the disease.  </i><br>
<p>
There are two papers most often cited supporting the contention that HIV <br>
'lurks' in the lymph nodes (by others, you do not cite any). The first was <br>
written by Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Health and appeared <br>
in the March 25, 1993 issue of Nature.  <br>
<p>
Fauci reported on his results in using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<br>
to count the number of HIV-infected T cells, as well as checking directly for<br>
cell-free virus particles. He compared the results from lymph node tissues<br>
against the those from circulating blood.  What did he find?<br>
<p>
Fauci gets down to brass tacks: "...a burst of viremia...a prolonged period...<br>
little, if any...very low...may be related...high levels...<br>
active and progressive..."but where are the numbers?  Although implying that <br>
he found large amounts of the virus, Fauci hid his only relevant statistics <br>
in the caption to figure 1, showing that HIV infected only about 1/100 to <br>
1/10,000 CD4+ T cells, EVEN IN THE LYMPH NODES.  And this assay DID NOT <br>
DISTINGUISH between cells containing active or dormant HIV.<br>
<p>
Fauci's went on to confirm existing textbook knowledge on the workings <br>
of the immune system.  He recalled that "an initially adequate immune <br>
response itself also contributes substantially to the clearance of virus <br>
from the circulation.  In the late stages of disease [AIDS], these mechanical <br>
mechanisms are altered and an effective immune response against HIV is lost, <br>
leading to an increase in viral burden in [blood cells]."  Viremia initiated<br>
from a previously suppressed virus and observed years after infection is a<br>
classical CONSEQUENCE, rather than a CAUSE of immunodeficiency.<br>
Many normally latent parasites become activated in immunodeficient<br>
persons, as for example Candida, Pneumocystis, herpes, cytomegalovirus<br>
and even retroviruses like HIV.  But HIV is just one of many<br>
opportunistic viruses unleashed AFTER the immune system has<br>
been suppressed. <br>
<p>
To eliminate any invading virus, the immune system coats it with<br>
antibodies, thereby immobilizing the offending germs. The neutralized<br>
germs are then filtered out in the lymph nodes. Fauci acknowledged<br>
this "virus-traping capability of the node," and his paper notes that<br>
the ONLY virus particles he could find in lymph tissues were<br>
"coated with proteins" [antibodies]. These were viruses caught while<br>
being destroyed. Furthermore, he does not report the actual number<br>
of such neutralized particles, which presumably means he found few.<br>
<p>
Fauci then interprets all this by concluding that HIV was being<br>
produced in the lymph nodes and released to the blood, ignoring his<br>
own outline of how the immune system works by trapping and<br>
transporting neutralized virus to the lymph nodes; and his inability to<br>
find any HIV that were not already coated with antibody. <br>
<p>
A much more competent paper by Genelabs Technologies of <br>
California and the University of Alabama, which appeared in Science<br>
on March 19, 1993, is the other paper I have heard proponents of<br>
the argument that HIV lurks in the lymph nodes cite.  In contrast to<br>
Fauci's paper, it provided hard numbers in an attempt to refute<br>
Duesberg.<br>
<p>
This study used quantitative PCR to measure levels of actual HIV<br>
expression in the blood, also examining amounts of p24 antigen<br>
[a protein contained in HIV particles] and even infectious virus<br>
itself. It purported to show high levels of HIV shortly after infection,<br>
followed by suppression during the latent period and subsequent<br>
reactivation when the patient reaches terminal AIDS. Was HIV<br>
the cause or a harmless opportunist?<br>
<p>
"First of all, the PCR and p24 data showed at best a poor correlation<br>
with the actual number of virus particles. Patients registering high<br>
on these molecular assays often had very little HIV, and vice versa.<br>
Thus only direct measurement of the virus are useful, a point well<br>
worth remembering for many other papers that have used such<br>
artifact-prone methods to claim high levels of HIV in the body."<br>
<p>
"Second, this new study revealed a complete absence of HIV while<br>
the patients T cell counts drop.  Of the 32 HIV-infected subjects<br>
with no symptoms of early stages of AIDS, having CD4+ T cell<br>
counts ranging from 231 to 1080, 28 had no virus whatsoever, while in the<br>
remaining 4 it was barely detectable. The virus is simply not around while<br>
the immune system undergoes most of its destruction."<br>
<p>
"Third, the virus was inconsistently reactivated in patients with full-blown<br>
clinical AIDS or T cell counts below 200.  Of these 28 cases, 6 had no<br>
virus at all. Only 6 others had greater than 1 thousand virus particles<br>
per milliliter of blood, and only 2 of those reached a high of 100,000<br>
particles per milliliter. This was an incredible spread of values, meaning<br>
that the virus could return from latency only in a percentage of patients<br>
whose immune systems had already been destroyed. Had HIV done the<br>
damage, it would have been found all along, in all individuals, in extremely<br>
large amounts. Only the 2 patients with the highest levels of the virus<br>
might have qualified; the other 26 did not. The verdict: HIV is merely a<br>
sporadic opportunistic infection."<br>
<p>
"The fact that these authors were able to find several patients with <br>
detectable HIV, which contradicts most other studies showing only a<br>
---tiny fraction of infected people with infectious particles, strongly implies<br>
that this group of patients had been carefully selected at the start.  The<br>
report failed to describe what risk group they fall into, nor how they were<br>
chosen.  In any case, the established scientific literature shows that the<br>
great majority of AIDS patients have no active virus at all."<br>

J. Ellison, Rethinking AIDS, v 1, #4, April 1993]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Antibodies do indeed clear it</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the blood and that's why it's not found in the blood for a variable</i><br>
<i>&gt;period of several years between initial development of antibodies and</i><br>
<i>&gt;late-stage disease.  </i><br>
<p>
Agreed. This is true for HIV and many other "passenger" and opportunistic<br>
viruses.  But the fact that they aren't around when the immune system is<br>
being damaged makes them poor candidates for causal agents. They are<br>
reactivated after the immune system collapses. Reactivation of previously<br>
suppressed latent viruses is a classical result, not a cause, of immune system<br>
collapse. For a virus to be reactivated, the immune system must first be<br>
destroyed by something else-the real cause of a disease.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, antibodies just aren't fast enough to provide</i><br>
<i>&gt;100% protection from transmissions in the lymph nodes.  </i><br>
<p>
Not "fast" enough?  Care to cite this reference?  Fauci couldn't find any<br>
HIV virus that wasn't "coated with proteins" [antibody] in the lymph <br>
nodes. They sound pretty "fast" to me. Textbooks, and Fauci [see above] <br>
recall that the lymph nodes are where neutralized virus are transported, <br>
filtered out and consumed by antibody. Fauci confirmed as much. <br>
If HIV was too "fast" for antibodies "in the lymph nodes", then<br>
Fauci would have found antibody-free virus in the lymph<br>
nodes. And if HIV was too "fast" for antibodies in the<br>
lymph nodes, why wouldn't it be too "fast" for antibody<br>
while circulating in the blood. Where is this reference to <br>
"fast" HIV in the lymph nodes, so I can read what would make<br>
HIV "fast" there, but only 'half-fast' elsewhere? I guess you<br>
are arguing that HIV is a "slow" virus in that disease occurs<br>
only after a latent period that averages 10 years in adults; AND<br>
that it is too "fast" for antibodies in the lymph nodes. So I guess<br>
it's a "fast" slow virus! <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;HIV can also jump directly from cell to cell in such a way </i><br>
<i>&gt;that antibodies aren't very effective.</i><br>
<p>
I'd like to read more about how HIV can "jump directly from cell<br>
to cell" in a manner that renders antibodies ineffective.  Especially,<br>
since you yourself mention:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Antibodies do indeed clear it from the blood </i><br>
<i>&gt;and that's why it's not found in the blood</i><br>
<p>
Since you mention that the antibodies do indeed clear it <br>
from the blood, does HIV only "jump" in the lymph nodes? So<br>
"fast" HIV lurks in the lymph nodes where it "jumps" from<br>
cell to cell. Facinating. I await your citations with bated breath.<br>
<p>
On the subject of citing sources, you mentioned:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;you might not be making elementary errors if you had</i><br>
<i>&gt;any references less that 6 years old...</i><br>
<p>
I notice you did not cite ANY references.  I suppose that entitles<br>
you to criticize my "6 years old" references with impunity? And,<br>
by the way, I cited Duesbergs book, copyrighted 1996, and<br>
A Lancet article from 1992.  So get a calculator.  And some<br>
manners. I expected better from a contributor to the<br>
Extropian list than the sentence quoted above.  <br>
<p>
