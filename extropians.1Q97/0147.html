<i>&gt;And today's quackery is often tomorrows allopathy. How many shamans</i><br>

<p>
The vast majority of shaman's drugs which are tested fail miserably under<br>
scientific scrutiny.  You are on a slippery slope.  In most societies there<br>
are remedies which have cultural significance but no real medicinal<br>
significance.  The list of "cultural" remedies is long and distinguished and<br>
includes famous ones such as powdered rhino horn for virility (Africa), and<br>
powdered sea corral among the Pacific Islanders (which is supposed to cure a<br>
wide range of ailments).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The nature of most alternative medicines is mysticism.  Authorities</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are revered over results--the older the authority, the better.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe thats because they have centuries of anecdotal evidence that in</i><br>
<i>&gt;sum adds up to a statistical analysis.</i><br>
<p>
Anecdotal evidence does not add up to statistical analysis.  Cultural<br>
remedies, like mentioned above, will provide all the anecdotal evidence you<br>
want, but not a shred of scientifically valid evidence.  If long-term<br>
anecdotal evidence is equivalent to a scientific statistical analysis, then<br>
Extropianism as a whole will have to seriously modify its position on a<br>
great many issues.  <br>
<p>
This is basically saying that a meme that survives must be true.  If I am<br>
not mistaken, this list has discussed the longevity and propagation of false<br>
or destructive memes at length.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;how many drugs are indtroduced which have more harmful side effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here's some shocking statistics for you: Over 10,000 people die each</i><br>
<i>&gt;year due to prescribed drugs conflicting, inducing allergic reactions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or being switched. Guess how many people died from nutritional</i><br>
<i>&gt;supplements, herbs, marijuana use, and natural hormonal supplements: 2</i><br>
<i>&gt;and they were both from Ma Huang taken in overdose.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;WHich is more harmful?</i><br>
<p>
You seriously misrepresent the statistics.<br>
<p>
1)  Most of those 10,000 people died taking drugs for which there is no<br>
equivalent "nutritional supplement, herbs, marijuana use, and natural<br>
hormone supplement".  Apples and oranges.<br>
<p>
2)  More than two people have died from Ephedrine (Ma Huang).  There have<br>
been many deaths and hospitalizations caused by the mixing of Ephedrine with<br>
other drugs.  I personally know of a death where Ephedrine was implicated. <br>
<p>
3)  You don't represent the number of people who died because they *only*<br>
took "nutritional supplements, herbs, marijuana use, and natural hormone<br>
supplements" when they should have been taking one of the above<br>
criminalized-but-effective pharmaceuticals.<br>
<p>
4)  Herbs in natural form contain far more allergens, toxins, and otherwise<br>
potentially damaging long-term components than pharmaceutically pure drugs.<br>
<p>
5)  Many popular herbs contain identical bioactive components to<br>
pharmaceuticals (pharmaceuticals having the advantage of eliminating (4) ).<br>
