<p>
For the most part I also found Greg's post accurate. However, I do take<br>
exception to his statement about observers analysing a work of art, that<br>
"some are more qualified than others". With such subjective desciplines<br>
as art, "expertise" is a chimera, and quite susceptible to corruption by<br>
the so called expert's subjective feelings, which can be quite damaging<br>
to progress if too much weight is given to the opinions of "experts". I<br>
give as an example the ongoing literary scandals in AUstralia, where<br>
anglo-saxon writers write under pseudonyms that are of aborigninal or<br>
other ethic descent in order to get published, as well as the scandal<br>
that destroyed the _Angry Penguins_, a modernist poetry rag down under.<br>
<p>
Too much "expert" opinion is merely pretension.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also, some of Sarah's questions are answered, briefly yet cogently, in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Transhumanist and Extropic Art FAQ which can be read at my URL. Here I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; stated by degrees how art can be considered extropic by the creative author</i><br>
<i>&gt; as well as the audience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Further, (and just a brief backtrack) Johnny had a problem with silicon and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that has been dealt with quite efficiently. We learned that there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a difference between silicon and silicone, etc-;  I wouldn't say the</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggestion was inept: it was not appropriate for flexible skin, but was</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate for a stiff armour.</i><br>
<p>
After seeing the whole debate, I'd like to throw another bomb on the<br>
fire by stating that I have a freind up here in NH who owns a company<br>
that produces flexible circuit boards. While they are not chips, when I<br>
visualized Natasha's first description, I imagined a black body suit<br>
with metallic circuitry embedded in the suit, to help with augmentation<br>
devices.<br>
