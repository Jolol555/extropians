Look, I'm just trying to establish a distinction between form and<br>
content here.  Everything you objected to is simply packaging for your<br>
convenience and the convenience of our hapless readers.  If I take away<br>
the packaging, which is all that you're objecting to, what's left still<br>
makes perfect non-circular sense.<br>
<p>
And, in another note, I'd like to point out that your defense has now<br>
completely wandered away from its earlier position that my definition of<br>
"definition" - as opposed to "my definition of "definition"" - is<br>
circular, and is now reduced to claiming that all definitions must rely<br>
on pre-existing ideas.  Again, how is my definition of "definition"<br>
circular, as opposed to our discussion of it?  Please do not object to<br>
this paragraph on the grounds that _it_ is circular.  I know this<br>
paragraph is circular, but this is not my definition of "definition".<br>
