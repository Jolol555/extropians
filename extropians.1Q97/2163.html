From: Lyle Burkhead &lt;LYBRHED@delphi.com&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; As long as macroscopic events are the result of atomic motions, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it doesn't matter whether atomic motions are deterministic or not.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; (b) Suppose they are not:  atoms (sometimes) move discontinuously </i><br>
<i>&gt; and unpredictably, and the result of all such motions is the world </i><br>
<i>&gt; we experience.  </i><br>
<p>
I am still trying to understand Omega's notion of "acausal" actions, which<br>
he seems to distinguish from both randomness and determinism.  An acausal<br>
event is one which has no cause, yet is not (simply) random.  Does this<br>
make sense?  Can we really distinguish acausality from randomness?<br>
<p>
It also seems true that, since the brain is composed of atoms and its<br>
activities can be looked at as the activities of its atoms, if the brain<br>
can be acausal then presumably at least some of the activities of its<br>
atoms are acausal.  So this cannot be a concept which applies only to<br>
conscious actors, but it must apply at the microscopic scale as well.<br>
<p>
An acausal event is not determined by other events, but it is not random,<br>
either.  What could this mean?  Well, when we think of randomness, we<br>
think of probability.  In principle with a random event we can specify<br>
a probability distribution over its possible outcomes.  Then we can<br>
imagine executing the event multiple times and observing the outcomes<br>
to see what the probabilities are.<br>
<p>
This requires a counterfactual perspective.  We have to imagine what might<br>
have happened if we had turned back the clock and redone the random event.<br>
(Alternatively, we could imagine preparing an ensemble of systems in<br>
identical states and observing the probability distribution over the<br>
outcomes of the many systems.)<br>
<p>
Perhaps one way to distinguish an acausal event from a merely random one,<br>
then, would be to deny this counterfactual possibility.  We would have to<br>
stipulate that acausal events, by their very nature, cannot be re-done in<br>
the manner that would be needed to establish a probability distribution.<br>
Since in fact we cannot turn back the clock, this is not in itself a<br>
very great leap.<br>
<p>
For the case of the ensemble of identical systems, we would have<br>
to specify that this is impossible in the case of acausal systems.<br>
Perhaps there is something about their state which makes it impossible<br>
to (ever) have multiple systems in the same state (obviously I am going<br>
beyond conventional physics here; this is philosophy).  Any acausal<br>
system occupies a given state only once in the history of the universe.<br>
It acts, undetermined by events, and goes on.  There is no possibility<br>
for a statistical evaluation of its random probability distribution<br>
because there is only one event, hence no statistics, hence no probability<br>
distribution and arguably no randomness.<br>
<p>
This can provide a counter to the argument that acausality is not a<br>
comforting source of free will because it is "just random", like tosses<br>
of a coin.  Coin tosses and other familiar sources of randomness can<br>
be repeatedly executed and a probability distribution established.<br>
Any given execution involves choosing an outcome blindly based on<br>
the probabilities.  But acausality is different because there are no<br>
probabilities.  The outcome is chosen as part of an irreproducable event.<br>
In effect, acausality is by definition outside of scientific analysis<br>
because there is no possibility of replication and testing.  This is<br>
very different from our conventional notion of randomness and so our<br>
intuitive abhorence of such effects as the source of our actions should<br>
not apply in this case.<br>
<p>
Well, that's the best I can do to try to understand what acausality<br>
might be.  It is difficult to find this tiny crack in the conceptual<br>
boundary between determinism and randomness, but I am not sure we can<br>
deny its existence.<br>
