In a message dated 97-03-09 23:00:47 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 The reason I have not already replied to your messages is due to the false<br>
 hope you would stop sending them. I have never seen a series of messages so<br>
 totally self-righteous and off base. You have no idea who I am, and there's<br>
 no way you could, yet you analyse me.<br>
 &lt;&lt;I would appreciate if you kept your<br>
 immature, uniformed, and insulting pop psychobable to yourself. You have no<br>
 right to judge me, only my ideas.&gt;&gt;<br>

Smile.... I am immature, uninformed and a pop psychobabbler, haha ...and so<br>
on... <br>
and in tthe same breeth youre telling *me* I am judegmental, what a silly<br>
guy...<br>
<p>
Listen to yourself!<br>
Hey, in anycase...<br>
I am not judging you, but rather your posts. However, saying I have no right<br>
to judge you is bizarre, how can you remove that right from me?<br>
<p>
 IMO, ( judge that I am) The best thing that has happened is that you have<br>
 decided to begin a constructive dialogue with the artist you slandered,  and<br>
that, I judge, is better than your original tone (condescending and<br>
insulting). <br>
<p>
The most offensive part of your original post, in judgement,  Pop Raven says,<br>
was *insenstivity8, is that she was honoring her father, the artwork was a<br>
memorial, if you had read clearly, and it was a tender gesture of love... <br>
