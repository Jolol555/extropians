<p>
The fact that two organizations both tout to seek a transition to "The<br>
Level Above Human" does not mean they have the same goals. The two<br>
organizations may have an entirely different conception of what exactly<br>
is meant by "The Level Above Human".<br>
<p>
I don't know if its the case here, but transpersonalism and<br>
transhumanism are often mistaken for each other. Where in grossly<br>
oversimplified terms transpersonalism is about the transcendance and<br>
annhilation of the ego or self, transhumanism is about the development<br>
and augmentation of the ego or self. transpersonalists tend to seek some<br>
form of finality or completion, e.g., bliss, heaven, utopia, a return to<br>
oneness with everything, etcetera, whereas transhumanists tend to favor<br>
evolution and development with no forseeable finality or completion. <br>
<p>
In other words, transpersonalists believe the transition to the "The<br>
Level Above Human" to be becoming one with God, Atman, The Ultimate One,<br>
The Aliens(?), whereas transhumanists tend to believe the transition to<br>
the "The Level Above Human" to be in a sense becoming a discrete and<br>
uniquelly individual "god" or uberman(sp?) ... per say. For the former<br>
the transition is and ends in itself, whereas for the latter the<br>
transition is a means for something always greater.<br>
<p>
The similarity in names is unfortunate. Personally I find<br>
transpersonalism repulsive.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>
