I'll give you some of my favorite quotes:<br>
<p>
"Fortunately, somewhere between chance and mystery lies imagination, the<br>
only thing that protects our freedom, despite the fact that people keep<br>
trying to reduce it or kill it off altogether." Luis Bu=F1uel (1900=9683),<br>
Spanish filmmaker.<br>
<p>
"Imagination is the voice of daring. If there is anything Godlike about God<br>
it is that. He dared to imagine everything." Henry Miller (1891=961980)<br>
<p>
"The imagination is the spur of delights . . . all depends upon it, it is<br>
the mainspring of everything; now, is it not by means of the imagination one<br>
knows joy?  Is it not of the imagination that the sharpest pleasures arise?<br>
Marquis de Sade (1740=961814)<br>
<p>
"The signs of a species preparing to mutate to a higher stage of<br>
intelligence." Timothy Leary (1979)<br>
<p>
"That's it!" Timothy Leary (1996)  (And it was.)<br>
<p>
"You must be able to do something before you can be rewarded for doing it!"<br>
Marvin Minsky (20th Century)<br>
<p>
"I have a dream: in my dream . . . Aretha Franklin, in her fabulous<br>
black-lipstick =93Jumpin=92 Jack Flash=94 outfit, leaps from her seat at=<br>
 Maxim=92s<br>
and, shouting =93Think!,=94 blasts Lacan, Derrida and Foucault like dishrags<br>
against the wall, then leads thousands of freed academic white slaves in a<br>
victory parade down the Champs-Elys=E9es." Camille Paglia (b. 1947)<br>
