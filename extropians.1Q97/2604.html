<i>&gt; Now to continue where i left off in the socialist/capitalist discussion, i</i><br>
<i>&gt; do see where ethics like that of self-sacrifice (understood that it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; voluntary, and based on individual decisions), and that of 'the good of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; many' etc, cannot be ignored in any rational system, nor should such ethics</i><br>
<i>&gt; become valued as 'inferior' or 'obsolete'. Something to which i still have</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions after the reactions on the last discussion.</i><br>
<p>
As much as I am tempted to simply give up and tell you to read<br>
Friedman (you don't even have to buy a book--just go browse around<br>
<a href="http://www.best.com/~ddfr/">http://www.best.com/~ddfr/</a>), I simply must call your bluff here.<br>
<p>
Why do you and other collectivists in one breath praise the value<br>
of others, and in the next breath claim that seeking your selfish<br>
interest would harm others?  That's a plain contradiction.  Other<br>
people are valuable to me; I cannot achieve my selfish goals without<br>
the cooperation and interaction of others.  Why do you refuse to<br>
listen to your own words?<br>
<p>
The morally bankrupt ideas of self-sacrifice are an intellectual<br>
pathology, a mystical belief that life is a zero-sum game, and that<br>
seeking your own interest necessarily harms others.  Give it up.<br>
Look at the facts in front of you: other people are a positive<br>
benefit to me /as a selfish individual/, and I will therefore act<br>
in my selfish interest to maximize their benefit to me.  The best<br>
way to do that is to encourage specialization, so that each can do<br>
what he does best, and free trade, so that each of us (not all,<br>
each) can most benefit from it.<br>
<p>
Not only /can/ "the good of the many" be ignored in a rational<br>
system, it /must/ be.  It, like democracy, is a pretty idea that<br>
can only produce misery in the long run, by mechanisms well known<br>
and clearly evidenced over the ages.  There are only two ways for<br>
all human interaction to take place: by unanimous consent, or by<br>
force.  Any attempt to place value on "society" or "the many" or<br>
"the majority" or anything else but individual self-interest will<br>
inevitably require the use of force, and is doomed to failure.<br>
