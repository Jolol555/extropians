Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;I don't doubt your perception, but I must say that mine is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;opposite.  When I see someone upset by a statement, it is usually</i><br>
<i>&gt;a simple, straightforward statement of fact or opinion.  </i><br>
<p>
I believe that we may be talking about different types of offense here.  <br>
My concern centers around power dynamics and the ways in which <br>
persons are belittled and controlled through intimidation and verbal <br>
bashing.  Language as a primary mechanism of social control.<br>
<p>
Your statement regarding generalizations is telling.  Most minorities <br>
do NOT consider generalizations to be 'just' generalizations, and <br>
most conflict theorists consider them to be legitimate causes of anger.  <br>
After all, these generalizations were used to hold people back all these <br>
years, and minorities are sick of hearing them.  They certainly have <br>
no place in advanced intelligent discussion.  As I write this, I <br>
wonder why this isn't a completely obvious point to persons like us <br>
who hope or claim to be advanced humans.  I certainly wouldn't want <br>
anyone I deal with to think that I believe dimwitted garbage about <br>
their particular identity.  And I certainly wouldn't want to inflict <br>
any emotional pain on them in that manner.  But that's just me, I <br>
guess.<br>
