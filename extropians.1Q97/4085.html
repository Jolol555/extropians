I asked for examples of the following:<br>
<i>&gt;1. There are (at least) two communities, each aware of the other's views.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. These views are relatively stable and substantial different.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. These views reflect actual beliefs, not just verbal posturing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. The dispute has lasted long enough so both sides know that </i><br>
<i>&gt;   both sides know that both sides know (etc.) ... that they disagree.</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. Both sides see the issue as a dispute over fact, not values, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;   believe that the other side does as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;6. We can't easily dismiss one group as small and primarily composed of </i><br>
<i>&gt;   people who are much more "cognitively broken" than most.</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. We can't easily dismiss the type of issue as exceptional in </i><br>
<i>&gt;   inducing "broken cognition" even in ordinary people.  </i><br>
<p>
Curt Adams said thought "everybody here" was "passably familiar with<br>
these issues enough so to say" that most of Michael Lorrey's list<br>
satisfied all of these conditions.  Specifically, he included:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;the Big Bang</i><br>
<p>
which I'm not aware has substantial disagreement. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;COmmunism</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Socialism</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;SDI</i><br>
<p>
which I'm not convinced here that most people do see as disputes over<br>
facts rather than values.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;JFK assasination</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Roswell Incident</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;MLK assasination</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The Philadelphia Experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the Rosenberg Trial</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the Alger Hiss trial</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Contragate (esp. Ollie North)</i><br>
<p>
where I know lots of people suspect foul play, but I'm sure most people<br>
really disagree on estimating the chances of such.<br>
<p>
I really think these three word titles are not a sufficient<br>
description of each dispute to evaluate their status regarding this<br>
issue.  More details please.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All the literature on human reasoning I'm aware of indicates the people have</i><br>
<i>&gt;many blatant errors in their reasoning, especially with respect to</i><br>
<i>&gt;probabilities (particularly important to Bayesian inference, which is based</i><br>
<i>&gt;on modifying probabilities of conflicting theories.)  What evidence is there</i><br>
<i>&gt;that *any* people, never mind ordinary ones, act like good Bayesian agents,</i><br>
<i>&gt;apart from in science?</i><br>
<p>
With "like" being the key word, lots of evidence.  Of course there is<br>
also evidence suggesting various sorts of anomolies &amp; deviations.  But<br>
it is a stnadard first approximation.  The question is: how good an<br>
approximation is it in different contexts?<br>
