Are you sure of that? A stealthy warhead launched from the far side of the<br>
Earth would be almost impossible to detect without surveillance<br>
sattelites. You certainly wouldn't be able to find it easily after the<br>
launch. With a big investment you might be able to spot the warheads with<br>
a radar cross-section the size of a marble that the Earthers put in lunar<br>
orbit as a precaution, but could do little about them if they put a<br>
hundred thousand real marbles up there as camouflage. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and have plenty of time</i><br>
<i>&gt; (two to three days) to get enough rocks in flight</i><br>
<p>
What if the humans have a smaller mass-driver in orbit and use that,<br>
rather than rockets, to shoot back at you? Also, how much power do you<br>
intend to have available? AFAIR you need five or six km/s to get from the<br>
lunar surface to Earth, so launching a one-ton rock will take about 14 GJ<br>
if your launcher is 100% efficient (hitting you with a fusion bomb from<br>
Earth orbit in one day would probably take more like 100 GJ, but they<br>
wouldn't need many of them). <br>
<p>
Hmm, so with a 1GW nuclear reactor you'd be able to launch four per<br>
minute, or about 18000 before you're nuked to rubble. At 10kt per rock<br>
you're only talking 180 megatons total, and I'd like to see the<br>
calculations that show a 10kt yield per rock. I don't have the conversion<br>
ratio from joules to tons of TNT handy, but my rough guess based on what I<br>
remember of the conversion efficiency in atomic bombs is more like 10<br>
tons. I might be wrong. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; to pulverize the</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire planet before your own launcher gets taken out.</i><br>
<p>
Let's see... even if you're right, the serious destruction area of a 10kt<br>
explosion is around 4 km^2. So you can destroy or severely damage about<br>
70,000 km^2 of Earth, or about 0.00001% of the surface or 0.00004% of the<br>
land area. Bad, but not as bad as WWII, particularly as most cities will<br>
be empty by the time your rocks hit them; if you can see missiles coming<br>
from Earth then they can see your rocks a day before they land. In<br>
comparison, the entire inhabited area of the moon will be nuked until<br>
they're just making the glowing rubble bounce and any survivors will be<br>
ruthlessly hunted down and executed. <br>
<p>
Feel free to prove my calculations wrong, but I'd have to be wrong by<br>
several orders of magnitude for your position to be realistic. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Additionally,</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember, terran nations would need Saturn V like launching capability</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do anything feasible in a lunar attack,</i><br>
<p>
The Saturn V was so large because it had to get several tons to the moon<br>
and back. What was Ranger launched on; an Atlas-Centaur? You could<br>
probably fit a large fission bomb or small fusion bomb into the mass of a<br>
Ranger probe. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; and if the corporation</i><br>
<i>&gt; developing the moon controls the best launch capability, terran nations</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be in a serious conundrum.</i><br>
<p>
That seems like a highly unrealistic "if" to me. If any corporation can <br>
build a launch vehicle that would make a lunar colony realistic then many <br>
others will be queueing up to buy them or build their own. Governments <br>
are likely to be among the first customers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Lunar construction also lends itself to bomb proofing. As a lunar</i><br>
<i>&gt; habitat would need to be protected from the hardest radiation, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; neccessarily be at least 6 feet under the lunar soil or rock surface.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the RAF built bombs in WWII that would penetrate a couple of hundred<br>
feet underground before exploding, and the USAF planned to use the<br>
original 'gun' atomic bomb to destroy Soviet submarine pens because it was<br>
so tough it could punch through a huge amount of concrete before<br>
exploding. <br>
<p>
Basically, if you can see it you can probably destroy it; why do you think<br>
that in WWIII the US president would be in a 747 and not an underground<br>
bunker? The mass-driver, of course, will be km long and easy to destroy;<br>
even a kamikaze attack with a lunar transport would knock it out for days.<br>
I did mention that the CIA had agents in your colony just in case you<br>
thought of this, didn't I? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Any inhabitable space would be an automatic bomb shelter. So even if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth takes out your gun, you still have the rest of your infrastructure</i><br>
<i>&gt; and population.</i><br>
 <br>
Even if they did survive they would be just sitting there waiting for the<br>
Earthers to arrive and hang them for war crimes... Hmm, wonder if you can<br>
hang people in lunar gravity? <br>
<p>
Seriously, your scenario seems to rely on a complete lack of opposition<br>
from Earth, in which case it would work. But that's not going to happen. <br>
<p>
Here's my scenario: You threaten to attack Earth. I say 'Make my day...'<br>
My agents who are working on mass-driver maintenance reverse the control<br>
inputs in the second half of the tube. You fire your first rock, and it<br>
slams into the side of the tube at 2500 m/s. If your calculations are<br>
correct, then that's equivalent to an explosion of more than 250 tons of<br>
TNT two-thirds of the way along the mass-driver. If I'm correct then it's<br>
still bad news. You can't launch anything until it's fixed.<br>
<p>
You refuse to surrender and rush around trying to fix it. My agents<br>
working on your nuclear reactor blow up the cooling system with survey<br>
charges provided by the industrial espionage agents working in your survey<br>
teams. My navy arrives three days later and nukes the mass-driver. You<br>
launch a missile at my flagship and I nuke all your surface installations.<br>
You surrender. Your colony is taken over and most of the survivors go to<br>
jail. <br>
