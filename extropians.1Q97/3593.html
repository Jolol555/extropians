On Thursday, March 13, 1997 12:06 PM, Kathryn Aegis cited Gregory <br>
Houston's quote from the Rational Emotive Based Training (REBT) <br>
essay:<br>
&lt;3. "REBT is based on the assumption that what we label our <br>
"emotional" reactions are largely caused by our conscious and <br>
unconscious evaluations, interpretations, and philosophies."&gt;<br>
<p>
Then she asked:<br>
&lt;Is this definition in keeping with the new neurobiological <br>
discoveries of hard-wired emotional systems (recently discussed on <br>
this list)?  I'm all for learning to control these systems more <br>
effectively, but I sense an underlying assumption here that they don't <br>
even exist.&gt;<br>
<p>
I sense that too, or at least the idea that if they do exist we can <br>
learn to consciously control them.<br>
<p>
For example, in Re: SOCIO: Friends, on Saturday, March 08, 1997 6:23 <br>
AM, Gregory wrote:<br>
&lt;What is better, the psychiatrist that "cures" a persons depression by <br>
giving them a drug, or the psychologist who cures a persons depression <br>
by teaching them to think in a new way and thus to change their CNS <br>
chemical content directly themselves.&gt;<br>
<p>
And David Musick more recently claimed:<br>
&lt;I'd just find a way to manufacture the same kind of chemicals the <br>
plants do in my own body; the body can make all kinds of chemicals, <br>
especially the brain... make your own dope, right inside your own <br>
body, custom-made, just how you want it!  What a deal!) &gt;<br>
<p>
It seems to me that we start off with these "hard-wired emotional <br>
systems" that roil our lives in many ways under various circumstances <br>
and, lacking the time or insight to analyze the responses at the time, <br>
particularly as children, the emotions become subconsciously <br>
associated with certain circumstances, and eventually build up into <br>
neurotic reflexes, reinforced by cultural taboos and stereotypes. <br>
 Even if we can learn to free ourselves from these associations by <br>
self-evaluation, that still doesn't free us from the underlying <br>
reflexes, things like "fight or flight" reactions, or sudden anger if <br>
we find ourselves in untenable positions.<br>
<p>
While yogis and others have supposedly demonstrated amazing feats of <br>
physiological self-control, and biofeedback can be useful for things <br>
like controling blood pressure and pulse, we're still along way from <br>
even understanding all the hormonal and neurotransmitter interactions <br>
that go on in our bodies and brains, let alone being able to control <br>
all of these via our rational faculties and select our feelings as if <br>
from a menu.<br>
<p>
Yes, it's important to abolish neurotic _ideas_ and understand the <br>
bases of our subconscious imagery, but that alone won't provide <br>
control over the underlying, hardwired emotional mechanisms.  I <br>
suspect that, in many cases, it is a genetic chemical imbalance that <br>
creates depression rather than some kind of 'improper' way of thinking <br>
that can be corrected through self re-evaluation.<br>
<p>
We need BOTH a curriculum for rational thinking AND chemical <br>
'switches' or 'enhancers' when there's either a genetic imbalance in <br>
our neurochemistry, or a set of undesirable neurochemical interactions <br>
that are too tangled to be resolved by biofeedback.  As long as we <br>
still live in a world of material scarcity, most people simply won't <br>
have the time to practice the type of disciplines that David and <br>
Gregory espouse.<br>
