David Musick meditated on mechanising creatitivity.  Here's a little something:<br>
<p>
Perhaps we too easily assume that people are utterly different from<br>
machines, even neural networks.  Can't we do something no machine ever<br>
displays - break free of set patterns, act creatively?  In THE CREATIVE MIND<br>
(1990), Margaret Boden, professor of psychology and philosophy at the<br>
University of Sussex, denies this.  As deft with musicology, romantic poetry<br>
and the history of science as with computational psychology, she gives such<br>
complacent prejudice short shrift.  Creativity, she notes, implies a<br>
capacity to jump free from a set of constraints into a surprising<br>
`impossible' solution.  To a modest extent, computer programs have already<br>
done this.  They've rediscovered laws of physics using the rude data and<br>
heuristics available to scientists in centuries past, written passable jazz<br>
(though not poetry), found unexpected solutions to mathematical puzzles.<br>
<p>
A simple example (too smug, too hasty, I got it wrong): if ABC changes to<br>
ABD, what will MRRJJJ become?  What does XYZ turn into?  A smart program<br>
named Copycat has provided a range of solutions.  Answers: since ABC maps to<br>
123, ABD equals 124; hence JJJ becomes JJJJ, yielding MRRJJJJ (not, say,<br>
MRRJJD or MRRKKK, let alone MRRKKKK).  And XYZ: XYZZ?  XYY?  XYA?  Maybe.<br>
But clever Copycat saw that A maps onto Z.  Running backwards, we get WYZ.<br>
Elegant.  Is that artificial mind creative, or what?<br>
