James Rogers:<br>
<i>&gt;2)  More than two people have died from Ephedrine (Ma Huang).  There have</i><br>
<i>&gt;been many deaths and hospitalizations caused by the mixing of Ephedrine with</i><br>
<i>&gt;other drugs.  I personally know of a death where Ephedrine was implicated.</i><br>
<p>
While I appreciate the thought you put into providing examples, you <br>
have neglected two elements relevant to this discussion:<br>
<p>
(i)  most of our basic pharmaceuticals (aspirin, penecillin, etc.) are <br>
based on plant extracts, which have been synthetically replicated and <br>
controlled.  This does not mean that the original substances are no <br>
less potent.  Ephedrine, or Ma Huang, can be found in half of the cold <br>
and allergy medications now on the shelf at any drugstore, and the <br>
label on decongestants clearly indicates that ephedrine is <br>
contradindicated for individuals who have emphysema, heart disease, <br>
bronchitis, high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid or prostate problems.<br>
<p>
(ii) death or other harm by overdose or combining is not the fault of <br>
any drug, herb or vitamin supplement.  It is usually the result of an <br>
individual either taking substances haphazardly or the doctor not <br>
having enough information to realize what reactions will occur.  For <br>
this reason pharmacists utilize computer programs to track their <br>
customers prescriptions.  My own doctor always asks what supplements I <br>
am taking and notes them in my file to prevent such problems.  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
