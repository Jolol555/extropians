[David Musick:]<br>
<i>&gt; keep everyone in line?  And as the Internet becomes more pervasive and </i><br>
<i>&gt; bandwidth increases, the meme exchange will be higher than it's ever been </i><br>
<i>&gt; before.  People will be surrounded with ideas contrary to their own.  This </i><br>
<i>&gt; will make creating a powerfully dogmatic belief system extremely difficult.  </i><br>
<p>
Can you say "Firefly"?  Why shouldn't the Internet allow people to<br>
surround themselves with others who think *exactly* like them, if they<br>
want to?  Now that they can find them and communicate with them?  What<br>
do you think we're doing *here*?  What do you think computer-targeted<br>
marketing is all about?<br>
<p>
I've always thought that there's probably a sizable amount of<br>
personality duplication going on; maybe no more than a million or two<br>
unique belief systems.  Firefly and its ilk will make that apparent,<br>
perhaps causing a thousand people who all think alike to collapse into a<br>
single super-person, with a thousand distinct levels of attention, with<br>
each person being able to take advantage of the decisions of all<br>
others.  Even if there are two many dimensions for points to coincide, a<br>
hundred thousand people who all think exactly the same way about laundry<br>
could collapse into a super-laundry-decider that could spend/distribute<br>
several days a week keeping track of all the various detergent<br>
companies, their pricing, their ethical behavior...<br>
<p>
*That's* when government will become unnecessary:  When people or<br>
e-people have enough attentional power to think *everything* through,<br>
and enforce - economically - their ethical standards, by being *aware*<br>
of what all the companies are doing.<br>
