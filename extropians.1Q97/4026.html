This question is irrelevant to the question I posed.<br>

<p>
Yes.  Relative weight of evidence = log likelihood ratio, which adds.<br>
<p>
These comments suggest to me that you are simply ignorant of the vast<br>
literature on the relations between theory and evidence.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and experience show us that not all evidence is created equal: one</i><br>
<i>&gt;measurement outweighs 1000 expert opinions.  If your mathematical</i><br>
<i>&gt;model shows that generally taking seriously the opinions of others </i><br>
<i>&gt;tends to reliably steer you toward theories supported by the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence, that is no use if the theory with centuries of history comes</i><br>
<i>&gt;against a single experiment that not everyone has seen yet, but that</i><br>
<i>&gt;inescapably discredits the majority. </i><br>
<p>
Of course evidence varies in strength.  If you happen to have<br>
available a particularly strong peice of evidence which no one else<br>
has yet seen, then of course this may outweigh all else.  But what if <br>
all those experts have seen this new experiment and their opinions<br>
have not much changed.  The question then is:  how sure are you that<br>
you have not missed or misunderstood some aspect of the experiment<br>
that seems to you to offer such strong support?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;... "paternalism" ... the experience of billions of parents, teachers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; employers, and local governments of thousands of years contains much</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; relevant information.  Why do they continue in this practice if it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; worse than an obvious and widely tried alternative? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They may keep practicing it out of fear, psychological predisposition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;insufficient knowledge of available alternatives, incomplete</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding of the "evidence", predisposition to favor the status</i><br>
<i>&gt;quo and ignore or deny its failures, and other reasons.  </i><br>
<p>
But you are just as likely to object to this common practice out of<br>
fear, predispositions, etc.  If anyone anywhere is actually looking at<br>
relevant evidence with some understanding, why is it so much more<br>
likely to be just you, rather than some influential fraction of these<br>
billions?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By your reasoning, nothing new and innovative would ever happen,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because that /requires/ imagining that every other opinion on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;planet might be wrong.  Human progress depends on such precious</i><br>
<i>&gt;arrogance.</i><br>
<p>
This is simply not true.  Majority opinion can favor experimentation<br>
and investigation into alternatives.  <br>
