[Saith Lee Daniel Crocker:]<br>
<i>&gt; (7) Other complex forms will evolve to continue themselves and use</i><br>
<i>&gt;   resources at my expense if they can.  To ensure the continuation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;   my consciousness, therefore, it is in my interest to learn as much</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as I can about the nature of such systems, and to create technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt;   that successfully defend against them.  Because of (5), this is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;   course of action most likely to lead to my goal.</i><br>
<p>
Really?  So the logical course of action for a Power would be to stomp<br>
on you before you stomped back.  Similarly, the logical course of action<br>
on my part would be to stomp on you before you stomped out my precious<br>
Singularity.  I prefer to think that cooperation between sufficiently<br>
intelligent beings is axiomatic - that is, any two Powers will cooperate<br>
on the Prisoner's Dilemna.  You apparently believe it is axiomatic that<br>
they will both defect.<br>
<p>
Putting the ethical issues aside, seeing as how neither of us is a<br>
Power, consider that saying you'll do your best to stamp out all other<br>
sentient entities is not a good idea.  They might stamp first.<br>
<p>
Generally speaking, trying to maximize your share of the pie as a<br>
negative-sum game is a bad strategy, because if everyone follows it, the<br>
pie shrinks.  I have no trouble with working to increase individual<br>
shares, as long as the game being played is always positive-sum.  That<br>
is, if you increase your share from 1% to 2%, you need only increase the<br>
size of the pie by 1.1% in doing so.  The best way to ensure this is to<br>
declare that all interactions between players will be positive-sum; this<br>
can be done simply by outlawing the use of coercive force that could<br>
force any individual to make a trade not beneficial to himself.  In<br>
other words, capitalist Libertarianism.<br>
<p>
So I reject your philosophy on the grounds that it wouldn't work if<br>
everyone followed it, and in fact won't even work for you because others<br>
will become aware that you intend to use coercive force to steal their<br>
shares, and will launch a preemptive strike.<br>
