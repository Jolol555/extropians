<i>&gt;By your reasoning, to get rid of slavery one would have had to convince</i><br>

<p>
What happened is that people were informed in more vivid detail about<br>
the conditions of life of real slaves, which convinced them that they<br>
didn't want to live in a state/nation/etc where those sort of things<br>
happen to people.  Concrete facts were more persuasive that abstract<br>
arguments about what is or is not "evil" in principle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It just makes no sense at all to argue about how to make something evil</i><br>
<i>&gt;more efficient, whether we've got it at present or not.</i><br>
<p>
Here's a news flash: it may not be possible to eliminate all evils in<br>
the world anytime soon.  Even if war is evil, for example, it makes<br>
sense to seek ways so wars kill fewer people when the happen.<br>
