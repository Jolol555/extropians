<i>&gt;&gt;  I am aware that I do not have a chance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;changing their views.  Right now my current goal is having someone say,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"That's a good argument, but I still believe."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; God's existence or non existence is a matter of faith. There's no</i><br>
evidence<br>
<i>&gt; that will make a very pious individual become an atheist. In any case,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's nothing about religion that is for or against nanotechnology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Judaism has always adapted to changes in society, and the Dalai Lama said</i><br>
<i>&gt; the physics would not change for Buddhism, Buddhism would change for</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics. You'll never conclusively prove God doesn't exist, simply</i><br>
because<br>
<i>&gt; no one who believes will accept it. Similarily, it's nearly (but less)</i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible to prove that God does exist. </i><br>
<p>
Just wondering, what did I leave out of my original post that showed an<br>
ignorance of this?  I cut down the quote and it seems to have the same<br>
message of your response.  I am just doing this as a hobby.  I know I<br>
cannot change anyone.  They must find the true path within themselves<br>
(religious terminology used loosely, and not at all seriously).<br>
