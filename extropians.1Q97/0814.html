<i>&gt; If people cannot be hurt by words or ideas, then how could it possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; make sense to assert that these are "dangerous memes"? If they cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; hurt people, then how can they be dangerous?</i><br>
<p>
I used "dangerous" to mean "destructive of reason, and counter to the<br>
goal of human progress".  Perhaps "destructive" would have been a<br>
better word.<br>
<p>
To clarify what I mean by the "people can be hurt by words" meme, I<br>
mean to say that when a listener suffers emotional pain, anger, or<br>
other distress upon hearing certain ideas, this meme assigns "blame",<br>
or moral culpability, to the speaker, rather than investigating what<br>
mental process of the listener actually caused the reaction.<br>
<p>
One of the most interesting studies of emotional response I have<br>
seen shows that infants often look to their parents to determine how<br>
they should react to certain stimuli.  They become upset because they<br>
see their parents upset.  I have a good friend with a very accident-<br>
prone son.  Whenever he falls, my friend bends over, spreads his arms<br>
like an umpire, and calls "safe" with a grin.  I've seen this kid<br>
with scrapes and bruises that would cause other parents to recoil in<br>
horror, and most kids to scream their heads off, and he just laughs<br>
while you clean and bandage him.<br>
<p>
In this particular case, it might do the kid some good to be a bit<br>
more concerned about his safety, but the point is that even so basic<br>
a reaction as crying at physical pain can be /learned/.  To react to<br>
words and ideas that way is certainly /more/ volitional than one's<br>
reaction to physical pain, so why do we assign culpability to the<br>
source of the words instead of the source of the reaction?<br>
<p>
Please don't misinterpret me--I'm not say such reactions are bad,<br>
or that they should be supressed.  I've reacted negatively to certain<br>
ideas myself (I remember the words "I'm moving in with Kevin" with<br>
particular attachment).  I merely suggest that we give credit where<br>
it is due.  My emotions are mine, dammit.  You don't cause them, and<br>
I don't cause yours.<br>
