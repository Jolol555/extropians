Lately, in the last year or two, I have been practicing the trick<br>
of shifting internal perspective in order to be able better to<br>
understand whatever words I happen to be reading or listening to<br>
at that moment. I have found that this trick, when worked at<br>
deliberately, seems to rather dramatically increase my learning<br>
rate. I'm sure others on the list have long ago mastered this<br>
technique of "flexible thinking/listening/reading", but I recommend<br>
it to those who haven't. One does need to have a lot of confidence<br>
in one's personal memetic immune system before deliberately developing<br>
this sort of skill.<br>
<p>
Anyway, one of the things that happened to me as a result of this<br>
practice is that where I used to find people who talked about God<br>
incomprehensible 90% of the time, now I only find them incomprehensible<br>
10% of the time (the low rate is because I successfully avoid<br>
communicative contact with the most obnoxious of the God-talkers).<br>
Usually, if I adopt a Thou-art-God solipsistic pantheist point of<br>
view, only identifying with the speaker/writer rather than with<br>
myself, the stuff they say about God and wisdom usually makes quite<br>
a bit of sense. I have found the Old Testament much more readable,<br>
although I haven't allowed it to eat my brain the way Lyle seems<br>
to have done.  And my previous (limited) understanding of some of<br>
the stuff emanating from Taoism and Zen Buddhism fits in pretty<br>
well with my more recent understanding of traditional Western<br>
mysticism. I suppose that mysticism could be defined as "the wisdom<br>
that you have to figure out for yourself"; it's not stuff that can<br>
be taught very well in the sorts of schools that don't take over<br>
your whole life, and I never cared for having my whole life taken<br>
over. The thoughts toward the end of this paragraph touch on<br>
Bartley's monograph "Morality and Religion" that I referred to<br>
earlier.<br>
<p>
I don't have much urge to become a God-talker myself though. As<br>
Tori Amos says, "God, sometimes You just don't come through." But<br>
the Gaia types and the CAW people make perfect sense to me in most<br>
of their discussions of these subjects. The solipsistic pantheist<br>
perspective is very worthwhile on some occasions though; I'm thinking<br>
about suspending myself in it full-time the next time I have a long<br>
relaxed vacation. If I get lost in it and accidentally start a<br>
cult, somebody slap me, okay?<br>
<p>
Of course, anti-God-talk such as Nietzsche's THE ANTICHRIST still<br>
makes just as much sense to me as it used to also. I guess I'm<br>
advancing *from* my philosophical commitments, as Bartley might<br>
say. The less I am seduced away from the-reality-that's-in-front-of-my-nose<br>
by teasing, tempting abstractions, the better my life seems to get.<br>
I think abstractions make good tools but poor masters.<br>
<p>
Abstractions? Heck: *memes* make good tools but poor masters.<br>
Including this post.  Just call me Arkuat Epimenides.<br>
