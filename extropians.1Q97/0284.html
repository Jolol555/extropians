John, don't you think, that once in a long while a honest researcher should <br>
use realistic, not ever worst-case (ask perfidous Penrose for these) <br>
numbers? We have seen a decade-long gallery of countless earlier <br>
estimates, by the most distinguished researchers, proven wrong, haven't <br>
we? What is the purpose of a discrete, modular, pretty precise structure <br>
if all it is good for is storing just .001 bits. Evolution doesn't <br>
produce complex circuitry for no good reason, if a simpler one would <br>
have been sufficient, no way.<br>
<p>
Ok, it has been in Science. I am not convinced, as a number of wet <br>
neuroscientists as well. While my estimate may be too high yours is <br>
certainly drastically too low. Future will tell.<br>

I wish you were right. Unfortunately, I think this is orders of magnitude <br>
too low. Reminiscient of earlier estimates "1 transistor=1 neuron". Ask <br>
Joe Strout, he burns any number of MFlops for hours to simulate just _one_ <br>
biologically realistic neuron, and far from running in realtime.<br>

Wrong. Life is a feasibility proof of a wet, folded linear biopolymer <br>
complementary autoassembly/autoreplication nanotech, _not_ of Drexlerian <br>
dry mechanosynthesis-based nanotech, a wholly different kettle of fish.<br>
We don't know whether mechanosynthesis-based autoreplicators are feasible.<br>

<p>
We don't know whether it violates the laws of physics. It may, it may not.<br>
We can't apply the laws of physics we know to say whether a certain <br>
complex structure is consistent with its advertised novel modus operandi. QM <br>
numerical runs of mechanosynthetic reactions are hazy at best. Whoever <br>
says the simulations have been validated is not telling the truth. They are <br>
not. Movies do not lie, lyers render movies.<br>

<p>
Wrong. Science works differently. _You_ have to prove it, not vice versa. <br>
It this attitude which allows science mainstream to go on ignoring <br>
Drexler's ideas, even if they do not deserve it. The Moon is made from <br>
green cheese. Prove it. A case of speculative engineering needs extremely <br>
convincing evidence for the other guys to listen at all. (And without the <br>
other guys nanotech will be impossible to do).<br>

<p>
No, but man-made things already fly. No man-made mechanosynthesis works. A <br>
STM demonstration of basic set of mechanosynthesis reactions, validating <br>
computer runs is sufficient for _me_. We don't have such evidence, that's <br>
why I rage against radiating smug certainty. We have just hints, no <br>
certainty. Don't give wrong signals.<br>

<i>&gt; Nanotechnology would work I wouldn't waste my time with it.</i><br>
<p>
I don't know whether Drexlerian nanotech will work. Fortunately, it's not <br>
necessary. I know that a certain brand of nanotech can work (because it <br>
is based on virtually unmodified live-derived machinery), which is not <br>
sufficiently strong to repair damage yet is sufficiently strong to grow <br>
molecular circuitry fit for running uploads. While destructive scan of <br>
vitrified cerebral tissue_is_ simpler with strong nanotech, it is not <br>
absolutely necessary. It won't be quick, it won't be pretty, but it will <br>
probably work.<br>
