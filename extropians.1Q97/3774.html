Mark Crosby wrote 3/17/97: &lt;certainty is a subjective feeling, not an<br>
objective truth.  I'm also certain that we can never be completely certain<br>
about most *things*, as opposed to *feelings*.... I agree that the most<br>
important thing is, as you [Jeff Dee] say, to be always questioning, trying<br>
to reduce uncertainty.&gt;<br>
<p>
I wrote in "Extropy" #15: "We achieve internal certainty through awareness<br>
that our subjective thoughts are objective truth to others.  We embody<br>
truth, we alone can be certain of our purposes because we can decide them<br>
instant by instant....  Coherency of purposes and values coupled with<br>
certainty is the desired condition prior to action.  This is the biggest<br>
enhancement of consciousness we can achieve immediately."  What you, Mark,<br>
are thinking (not "feeling" because we don't want to sound like flaky<br>
emotivists) right now, the certainty you have in deciding your purposes<br>
instant by instant, is objective truth to me.<br>
<p>
I cannot quite get inside your head and access your exact thoughts (the<br>
qualia problem), but I can approach it using various methods of reducing<br>
uncertainty.  I wrote in the history paper: "It's the reduction of<br>
uncertainty in the incoming stream of continuous reality that tells us<br>
somewhat of the precursors to this stream.  The evolution of consciousness<br>
is accelerated as we get better at this.  We increase our ability to choose<br>
more adaptive paths of action as we anticipate future dangers that would<br>
threaten our purposes."  So I am in agreement with you and Jeff here<br>
regarding the importance of reducing uncertainty, this is science's primary<br>
role.  I am uncertain that "we can never be completely certain about most<br>
things," if you qualify the statement to read "most *important* things." <br>
Our ability to be certain about things and thoughts is tied very intimately<br>
to their importance to us.  Importance fluctuates over time and within<br>
contexts, our certainty therefore blips in and out.<br>
<p>
Certainty is a liquid realm concept, it is the conjunction of consciousness<br>
(chaotic realm) and being (ordered realm).  Another way to look at the<br>
central position certainty has in our lives, is to picture consciousness as<br>
a coherent dynamic energy pattern operating in the past formulating<br>
purposes - Cramer's backwards-in-time microcausality Omega was posting<br>
about (transactional interpretation of QM); aimed at and stabilizing in the<br>
now - being or the particulate substance of the universe; then springing<br>
forth from this ordered foundation into the chosen future, existence itself<br>
- Cramer's forwards-in-time microcausality.  We may choose entropic<br>
purposes that lead to loss of pattern coherency, we may miss our footing<br>
springing from being, our chosen future may go awry in conflict with other<br>
entities or brute necessity, but certainty lifts us above inanimate matter<br>
and low-level life forms.<br>
<p>
The compost-modern worship of the will-to-power that replaced waning<br>
interest in truth, had nowhere to go except, as Deleuze &amp; Guattari said,<br>
"turning to destruction, abolition pure and simple, the passion of<br>
abolition."  The strenuous efforts by the cultural elites (both humanists &amp;<br>
technicists share the same culture regarding this) to abolish certainty in<br>
favor of radical skepticism (nihilism) have one objective:  the denial of a<br>
future for humanity.  The passion of abolition that sets in, once the truth<br>
has been jettisoned, doesn't abate until we sink back to the animal's level<br>
or lower.  A culture with an impoverished epistemology of<br>
'criticism-unto-destruction' will result in destruction all right, the<br>
destruction of the critic.  This is what the Unamuno quote was getting at.<br>
<p>
Mark: &lt;Am I to conclude from [the Unamuno quote] that reason is inimicable<br>
to life? I think not - that would be a dualistic copout. Rather, BOTH will<br>
AND reason, empirical induction and conceptual deduction, will compete to<br>
make the extropic transformation. Which we *emphasize* does not depend on<br>
truth, but on perspective or, dare I say it, utility.&gt;<br>
<p>
Indeed it would be a cop-out, Unamuno achieved penetrating philosophical<br>
insights by his conceptualizing of life and reason competing, very<br>
fruitful.  I largely agree with what you say, I would not give a privileged<br>
position to either truth or utility, but perspective is closely related to<br>
meaning, and I would give that which increases meaning in our lives, a<br>
privileged position when it comes to which we emphasize.<br>
<p>
Mark: &lt;Don't misinterpret me: Baudrillard seeks dissolution because he<br>
thinks <br>
this is an awful world, while I, as an Extropian, would seek coherence <br>
- drawing out the truth and beauty from amidst the overwhelming noise <br>
and decay.  But, is this not also a seduction of reality?&gt;<br>
<p>
Are all seductions bad?<br>
<p>
Mark: &lt;I see these "creative interpretations" as deductions - I want it to<br>
be <br>
so, even though it is not yet so (or my interpretation is incomplete), <br>
so I will do my best to make it so!&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree with you here.  The only danger is that pure deduction can lead<br>
completely away from truth, or objective reality; and land you in a<br>
solipsistic backwater of subjective reality leaving you vulnerable to<br>
unpleasant surprises in real life.  Pure deduction loses all meaning unless<br>
it is correlated to ontological particulars.  I guess the method of<br>
correlating would be the extropic transformation referred to above.<br>
<p>
Mark: &lt;Now, I have not read Popper.  About all I knew about Popper prior to<br>
<p>
this was his notions of Worlds 1-3.  Until now I had associated these <br>
with Reilly's more elegant notions of ordered, chaotic and liquid <br>
realms.&gt;<br>
<p>
Popper's worlds were essentially epistemological divisions, similar to<br>
Edmund Husserl's earlier divisions.  My epistemological divisions, or<br>
boundaries in aspectual reality space, I posted some time ago on the<br>
E-list: subjective reality ("I"), consensual reality ("We"), and objective<br>
reality ("They/It") - a three-in-one unity, three unbridgeable<br>
epistemological aspects of one underlying reality.  The notions of chaotic,<br>
liquid and ordered realms are ontological, not epistemological.<br>
<p>
Mark: &lt;I too prefer truth / verity rather doubt, problems and refutations; <br>
but, as Reilly has said in his "Extropic Thought" essay, "dualism is <br>
philosophy's perennial cop-out". And, a few paragraphs later in that <br>
same essay Reilly says: "Concepts are pruned to our desire for truth <br>
through methods of falsifiability or verifiability." I notice he says <br>
"or", not "and".&gt;<br>
<p>
The portion of the history paper you are quoting from was a discussion of<br>
why some concepts last and others don't.  In describing different<br>
scientific methods, I used 'or' rather than 'and' because most scientists<br>
today do not attempt to simultaneously satisfy both principles,<br>
philosophical "dualism" doesn't come into play.  I don't concentrate on the<br>
pros and cons of the methods, although I do emphasize the peripheral nature<br>
of falsifiability vs. the centrality of verifiability regarding the<br>
longevity of concepts.<br>
<p>
"Following (to some degree) W.V. Quine's formulation of how scientific<br>
choices are made as to which concepts to keep and which to discard, there<br>
exists a coherent web of peripheral concepts surrounding a central core of<br>
interdefined concepts.  When observations are at variance with what we<br>
predicted, we generally rearrange the exterior web of concepts far more<br>
readily than we discard the central core of concepts.  Thus, falsifiability<br>
tends to function peripherally, and is identified with coherency theories<br>
of truth, with closed-system definitions, axioms and logical deductions. <br>
The central core of concepts generally have been verified through the<br>
physical mediation of technology between value-laden concepts and objective<br>
physical reality.  That is to say, these central concepts either work or<br>
they don't work; as technology develops, the central concepts develop. <br>
Thus, verifiability tends to function centrally, and is identified with<br>
correspondence theories of truth, within open systems."<br>
<p>
George Gilder talked about the centrality of verifiability in "Forbes ASAP"<br>
(Dec. 2,1996): "The cumulative facts of science manifest themselves in<br>
technology, powerful and practical machines that cumulatively and<br>
empirically validate the new paradigms and generate new science in the<br>
process."<br>
<p>
Mark: &lt;Reilly contends that the farther we go, the *more* we know.  While<br>
this is true, it is also true that the more we know, the more we realize<br>
how much more there is still to be learned. Acknowledging this does not<br>
mean one has sunk into irrationalism!&gt;<br>
<p>
Nor was this either Stove's, Kimball's or my suggestion.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;We acquire knowledge by directing our internal searchlight at the <br>
metaphysical unknown in search of something we can call a problem to <br>
work on. As our searchlight sweeps the metaphysical night sky, we map <br>
what reveals itself in the beam and interpret the map according to our <br>
utility of the moment.&gt;<br>
<p>
Mark: &lt;Is this not similar to the functionalism (or was it utilitarianism) <br>
that you were criticizing Gregory Houston for a month ago? Is this <br>
"inventing purposes" or "pursuing truth", and how can you so certainly <br>
draw this fine line for someone other than yourself?&gt;<br>
<p>
It is pursuing truth.  I am not describing looking for lies, I am<br>
describing looking at objective reality on the other side of the<br>
epistemological boundary between it and our subjective reality ("I").  The<br>
boundary itself is where metaphysics opens up.  When Gregory Houston wrote<br>
"I have no desire to attain truth," he announced he was looking elsewhere<br>
than at objective reality, that he wasn't going to bother with the maps. <br>
This is not a fine line, but a rather wide flourescent yellow line. <br>
Utilitarianism is all purpose, no truth; all meaning rapidly bleeds away.<br>
<p>
Guru George wrote 3/17/97: &lt;...unless you believe in some queer magical<br>
connection between what we say and the way the world is such that there is<br>
some logically necessary link between them (which denies the very principle<br>
of objectivity, which says that there is *no* such logically necessary<br>
connection, that the world exists the way it does independently of our<br>
whims, our thoughts and theories) you*must* (logically!) be a Popperian.&gt;<br>
<p>
Logically, you can't find anywhere where "you" end, and some "world," not<br>
containing "you," begins to independently exist.  Logically, no notion of<br>
"indepedence" can possibly have any meaning unless it is ultimately in<br>
relation to transcendence.  Independent from what?  You can't draw any<br>
lines, separate out any entities or objects, anywhere in a continuous<br>
space.  The category boundaries are arbitrary, based on our whims.  This is<br>
the unity of the underlying ontology.<br>
<p>
Certainly, there are epistemological boundaries to be drawn, between you<br>
and the world, between you and others, between others and the world. <br>
Criticism-unto-destruction may be one methodology (or at least an<br>
interesting spectator sport from a safe distance) between others and the<br>
world, but it is not necessarily a very healthy attitude between you and<br>
others (certainly it is very destructive regarding intimacy and trust), and<br>
it is utterly inapplicable between you and the world (you're on your own<br>
there).<br>
