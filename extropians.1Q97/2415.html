<p>
The world you *think* you're seeing, which is really just a data<br>
structure. A good demonstration of this comes from experiments where<br>
computers are programmed to change the displayed text when your eyes are<br>
jumping from one place to another in a saccade. We seem to build up this<br>
data structure inside our brains and only update it when we see movement,<br>
but deactivate the movement-detectors when we move our eyes. Hence if the<br>
text changes when your eyes are in motion we still 'see' the same text on<br>
the screen until we examine it closely and suddenly realise that it's<br>
changed. I found this a real shock the first time, but it's happened to me <br>
so often now that I just find it annoying. <br>
<p>
Another demonstration comes from the experiences of psychedelic users, who<br>
(AFAIR) report that the objects they see are far more likely to move<br>
around or change into something different than, say, for the perceived<br>
world to split up into squares and zoom around their field of view as we<br>
might expect if we were just seeing a pixel image from the retina. <br>
Changing a pixel-image of a plant-pot into a pixel-image of an elephant<br>
would be hard work, but simply changing the object description in our data<br>
structure from 'plant-pot' to 'elephant' or changing the coordinates in<br>
space is easy. <br>
