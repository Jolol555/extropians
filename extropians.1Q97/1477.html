There was a fascinating demonstration on the last _Scientific American<br>
Frontiers_ (like the magazine, the show is more concerned with liberal<br>
politics and entertainment than scientific integrity, but an occasional<br>
gem slips though the fog).  They read lists of words to the subjects,<br>
then had then read back the list from memory while being PET scanned.<br>
Each word list had a theme, and each one left out some words obviously<br>
belonging to that theme, so naturally some people "remembered" those<br>
words.  The PET scans, though, were clearly distinguishable--especially<br>
by activity in the auditory region--between those words actually heard<br>
and those "remembered" falsely.  Something like this is bound to show<br>
up in a courtroom before long.<br>
