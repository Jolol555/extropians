<i>&gt;I won't back down quite that far: it's not just what works for /me/,</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is my experience of what has worked for humankind throughout</i><br>
<i>&gt;history, and what I believe will work to get us to the kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;future I want to live in.  If I have "attacked" anyone (which is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;characterization I disagree with, but I'll let it stand for now), it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is for using methods that I indentify from history as those that have</i><br>
<i>&gt;failed to serve the purposes they apparently seek.  If they can</i><br>
<i>&gt;convince me otherwise, I'm here listening (despite that you may think</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am not).</i><br>
<p>
Let me just say that I prefer the style of argument that uses reason in<br>
finding particular fallacies, particular false premises, particular<br>
mistakes, and particular irrelevancies to the style of argument that<br>
makes sweeping judgements of "irrationality" and "mystical nonsense". I<br>
think the former style of argumentation is far more rational than the<br>
latter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; This is sheer sanctimony, Lee.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes.  So, what's your point?  That is is wrong to express ethical</i><br>
<i>&gt;judgment?  Isn't that itself an expression of ethical judgment?  </i><br>
<p>
Of course it is. I must admit, it's the self-reference involved in<br>
accusing other people of sanctimony that delights me so that I do this<br>
more often than I probably should.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If the boorish lout has some ideas worth examining, even if only to</i><br>
<i>&gt;refute them, isn't choosing not listen dangerous?  Should I burn all</i><br>
<i>&gt;the copies of Mein Kampf?  Supress the Communist Manifesto?</i><br>
<p>
This is insufferable. All I'm doing is pointing out that you might be<br>
more effective in attaining your own goals if you were to argue in<br>
a way that actually stands a chance of getting some useful information<br>
across to other minds, and you act as if I'm asking you to censor<br>
yourself. I am not asking you to supress your ideas or practice<br>
dishonesty, and I have never suggested anything of the kind. What I have<br>
asked for is an active awareness that the emotional state of your<br>
audience has direct effects on how *able* they are to understand the<br>
ideas that you are presenting to them, and that you are shooting<br>
yourself in the foot (and damaging my cause as well, since I suspect<br>
that I agree with you on most substantial issues) by deliberately<br>
destroying the receptiveness of your audience.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't remember ever telling anyone what to do; I merely expressed</i><br>
<i>&gt;my own evaluation of the ideas they presented.</i><br>
<p>
With what end in mind? *That* is what I am asking you to bear in mind.<br>
Are you engaging in discourse for mere amusement, or do you want to<br>
accomplish something in the world by means of your discourse? At this<br>
point I can only conclude that you must be in it for sheer amusement, so<br>
there is no point in my attempting to continue this particular argument.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If that evaluation is</i><br>
<i>&gt;"mystical nonsense", then sobeit.  That's what I'll say.  Seems to me</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you're the one telling people what to do: keep your judgments to</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself, be more considerate of other ideas, be polite at the expense</i><br>
<i>&gt;of being honest.  Sorry, but I don't buy it.</i><br>
<p>
This is a slanderous accusation. At no point have I asked you to<br>
sacrifice your honesty. I have asked you to be considerate of the<br>
emotions of others in order to *enable* them to profit from *your* ideas<br>
that *you* have to offer them. (One can also learn from argumentation,<br>
but whether or not you choose to do so is strictly up to you: this is<br>
not the point which I am currently arguing.) I have not asked you to be<br>
considerate of the *ideas* of others; only their emotions, because if<br>
you destroy the emotional ground of cooperativeness in an audience who<br>
prefers cooperative conversation to aggressive argumentation, then you<br>
are simply defeating yourself at the outset. Nor have I asked you to<br>
keep your judgments to yourself, although I have suggested the simple<br>
truth that judgements of particular flawed arguments and particular<br>
concrete mistaken beliefs are usually more effective than dismissive<br>
judgements of a person's intellectual style and philosophy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That may be a fair observation.  I don't really encounter that</i><br>
<i>&gt;reaction much except on the net, because the only people with whom I</i><br>
<i>&gt;discuss libertarian ideas are those that know me well, and know that</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am personally kind, generous, tolerant . . . and opinionated.  I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;not really bothered at all by even the most "sanctimonious" Randroids</i><br>
<i>&gt;(to use your term) so long as they are just expressing ideas.  I know</i><br>
<i>&gt;some are, but the raw numbers show that the ideas are spreading well</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyway.</i><br>
<p>
They are spreading, but they aren't spreading fast enough for *my*<br>
taste. What sort of complacency is this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't want to live in the kind of world where I can't be</i><br>
<i>&gt;straightforward and honest, and I'm not convinced yet that lying (or</i><br>
<i>&gt;"softening" my prose, or whatever euphemism you like) will help me</i><br>
<i>&gt;get to the kind of world I want.  Maybe I will be, but I just don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;see it yet.</i><br>
<p>
More slander. Acting as if the emotions of your audience are worthy of<br>
concern does not entail dishonesty. The way I tend to conduct my<br>
argumentative affairs, if I have no concern for a particular person's<br>
feelings, neither do I have any interest in arguing with them (unless I<br>
am forced to, e. g. in a court of law.) I am no longer interested in<br>
continuing this particular discussion. My best wishes to you, sir.<br>
