I wrote, <br>
 <br>
: Good.  Now you know what real art is.  (I can hear the reply already:  <br>
: "Oh, so that's what real art is.  It makes you sick!"  No, dear...  but <br>
: it has an intense effect, for better or worse.  It gets things in focus <br>
: so you can't help responding.)<br>
<p>
to which QueeneMUSE replied: <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unless you think I am dear to you, you're condescending , </i><br>
<i>&gt; I feel ill again  </i><br>
<p>
Hmm.  Maybe you are dear to me, sort of...  there was an element of <br>
affectionate playfulness in that "No, dear."   But I was also being <br>
condescending.  Both.  The thing is, Nadia, you presented yourself to <br>
the list, and to me, as a woman.  Not an austere philosopher like <br>
Elizabeth Anscombe, but a bubbly female, kind of an artist/airhead <br>
type.  That's the role you have established for yourself, and you are <br>
going to get some condescension.  Not only that -- here's another <br>
brutal truth -- when you say that the concept of real art is <br>
too silly to respond to, you are going to get hostility and contempt <br>
from people who care deeply about real art.  <br>
<p>
But my intention was never to make you ill.  Making women ill <br>
was my dad's trip, not mine.  If that's what's happening here, then <br>
I do need to change my ways.  Point taken.  <br>
<p>
