No. The UN has historically been a tool of the US government (or at least<br>
it usually votes the way that the US government votes). <br>

Strawman. You're postulating a device against which we have no defence,<br>
when in real life there is some defences against everything. Even if you<br>
come up with a weapon that can destroy all life on Earth (e.g. the huge<br>
asteroids with mass-drivers that we've been talking about in other<br>
threads) that would simply imply that we should get off of it. <br>
<p>
Show me a weapon that we have no defence against and I'll take this more<br>
seriously. But I might well prefer the risk of death to living in the kind<br>
of police state that controlling the technology would require. <br>
