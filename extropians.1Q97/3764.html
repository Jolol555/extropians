<p>
Art is an abstract, a fuzzy concept both for the author as well as the<br>
observer, and putting concrete definitions on "art" can be rather difficult. <br>
<p>
Defining a specific artistic concept is more approachable because it is less<br>
difficult to explain an idea, per se.  It seems quite appropriate that the<br>
author of an art piece (artefact or non-form) would want to explain what it<br>
is he is doing.<br>
<p>
Defining art genres, art forms, art movements, art styles, etc., is not such<br>
a problem and people make a career out of it.  Art historians and theorists<br>
are much in demand for not only educational reasons but for observers of art<br>
as well. Defining art has been done for centuries and will continue to be<br>
done as long as new ideas are generated, or old idea rehashed.<br>
<p>
Cubism is defined.  Abstract Expressionism is defined. Op Art is defined.<br>
Baroque music is defined. Techno music is defined.Modern dance is<br>
defined.The Tango is defined.  Method acting is defined, performance art is<br>
defined. A play, novel and prose are defined.<br>
<p>
These examples meet certain criteria.  There is also art that does not meet<br>
specific criteria, and many artists who enjoy exploring the fuzzy realms.<br>
This in itself can be very creative, and adventuresome.  An artist can also<br>
explain an idea of work by writing about it theoretically, or express it<br>
through a feeling. Another example is an artist who is adept at psychology<br>
and/or symbolism using an archetypical language to get the meaning across<br>
subliminally.<br>
<p>
I appreciate anyone who does not want to boundaries, signs and labels on the<br>
general concept of "art."  For me, art is such a great experience, both<br>
feeling and producing, that I want it to be what it is for me.  Yet art is<br>
also objective and definable.<br>
<p>
I don't think anyone who has participated in this debate is wrong.  Let each<br>
pursue and experience life as he will.  But when art as a term, as a<br>
profession, as a means of living is pigeonholed incorrectly, it draws my<br>
attention quite profoundly. <br>
<p>
My suggestion is that if anyone wants to debate art, let's take it to a new<br>
level.  Let's discuss major issues about creativity and art. Sarah had<br>
initiated a thread that I did not place the focus I could have on it because<br>
of time constraints. Shall we return to that?<br>
