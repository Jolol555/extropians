Damien Broderick wrote 2/28/97: &lt;An interesting source that I've belatedly<br>
discovered on these topics, blending cognitive science and informed<br>
literary theory, is Mark Turner.&gt;<br>
<p>
A very good article by Turner, "Design for a Theory of Meaning", appeared<br>
in the book "The Nature and Ontogenesis of Meaning", W. Overton and D.<br>
Palermo, eds., (Erlbaum, 1994), pages 91-107.  Turner productively draws on<br>
the work of neuroscientist Gerald Edelman and cognitive scientist George<br>
Lakoff to examine the imaginative mind in the light of genetics,<br>
experience, biology and culture.<br>
<p>
It is unfortunate that Mr. Lakoff, in publishing his latest book "Moral<br>
Politics:  What Conservatives Know that Liberals Don't" (1996) has revealed<br>
himself to be yet another politically correct utopian pinko scientist, an<br>
irredeemably "learned ignoramus."  He should stick to his narrow field,<br>
like most scientists should, and do something useful in it, expanding on<br>
Vico's foundational axioms in cognitive science.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;A convenient summary of such errors, documented by Luc Ferry and<br>
Alain Renaut, Andrew Scull, Erik Midelfort, Leon Radzinowicz, Michael<br>
Ignatieff, Douglas Hay, and David Garland, is sketched in Keith<br>
Windschuttle, The Killing of History (1994), pp. 145-54.&gt;<br>
<p>
"The Killing of History:  How a Discipline is Being Murdered By Literary<br>
Critics and Social Theorists", by Keith Windschuttle (2nd Ed. 1996) is a<br>
highly recommended antidote to all the filthy compost-modern revisionist<br>
history, nihilistic literary criticism, etc. of today (note I'm not<br>
singling out just the French like Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard, et al this<br>
time; but I'm not going soft, honest).<br>
<p>
My stylistic soulmate Roger Kimball, writing in the Sept. 96 issue of "The<br>
New Criterion" regarded this book as the most important work of cultural<br>
criticism to appear in many years.  Kimball wrote: "at a time when what Mr.<br>
Windschuttle calls 'the return of tribalism' threatens many parts of the<br>
world with a descent into barbarism, to embrace cultural relativism is also<br>
to embrace the 'charnal house politics' that have brought such misery and<br>
destruction to Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Central Africa, the Balkans, and<br>
elsewhere.  This indeed is where the arcane theories of Derrida, Foucault,<br>
and their epigoni collide with the real world.  They abandon the<br>
constraints of empirical truth in the name of liberation.  But what they<br>
wind up with is not freedom but a new and more terrible servitude."  And<br>
that is the truth, I'm certain of it.  Gregory Houston, you might pick up<br>
and peruse a copy of it.<br>
