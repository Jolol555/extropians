I would agree that counting these things is better than not counting.<br>
This doesn't help that much though. I'll try to give two examples.<br>
<p>
1.   Let's try to compute inflation.<br>
Suppose the following goods were sold in the following years:<br>
<p>
<p>
                 1980		      1997<br>
<p>
           Quantity  price,      Quantity   price,<br>
             sold     each         sold      each<br>
<p>
Bicycles      1       $100        1         $200<br>
Megs          1       $100        1000      $0.20<br>
Bauds         -         -         56K       $0.001<br>
<p>
<p>
Suppose the quality doesn't change (ha-ha).<br>
<p>
Inflation on bicycles: about 4% a year<br>
Inflation on Megs:     about -40% a year.<br>
Inflation on Bauds:    ?<br>
<p>
Now, more interesting:<br>
<p>
Inflation on bicycles AND Megs.<br>
<p>
Method 1.<br>
<p>
 A 1980 typical basket of 1 bike +1 meg costs $200 in 1980<br>
and $200.2 in 1996.   Inflation = 0.<br>
<p>
 On the other hand, a typical 1997 basket of 1 bike and 1000 megs<br>
in 1997 cost $400, and would have cost $100,000 in 1980.<br>
Inflation about -40% a year.<br>
<p>
So which basket should we count?<br>
<p>
- and this all for the same goods of the same quality.<br>
<p>
Now add bauds to the picture. And Netscape. And 60 million web pages<br>
you can look through. And ideas on architectures of complex systems that<br>
appeared while people were building all of these.  Still, these things<br>
are just resources - and you can do use them to produce results that<br>
were not even in anybody's imagination in 1980.  And those *results*<br>
are the things you want to count.<br>
<p>
<p>
2.  Another economic problem: a breast cancer patient had to pay $5000<br>
for painful treatment and a coffin in 1980, and $20,000 in 1997 - for a<br>
(painless) treatment only. The coffin doubled in price, but it is no<br>
longer needed, as the patient now survives.<br>
 What is the inflation rate here?<br>
<p>
