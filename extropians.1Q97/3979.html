<i>&gt; Mr. Lorrey properly pointed out that I had ignored one of his earlier</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments, and I misinterpreted his later reference to it.  I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; attempt to remedy this.  First, his point:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; For example: There have been approximately 5.5 million inventions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; patented in the US in it entire history (mostly during periods when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; patent rights are vigorously enforced, hint hint) while laborers have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; worked approximately 25 x 10^13 hours in US history. This means that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in fair market value, the average invention is equal to 4.55 million</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; man hours of physical labor in relative scarcity. If we value the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; average man hour at as little as $1.00 per hour (which was typical</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for the turn of the century, never mind that 2/3 of all workers have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lived since that time) we see that the fair market value for an average</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; invention is $4.55 million dollars.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Any responses to this quoting communist rhetoric and I will puke.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ignoring the parenthetical hint which is clearly circular (defining</i><br>
<i>&gt; inventions as patented things, then claiming most inventions happened</i><br>
<i>&gt; under patent laws)</i><br>
<p>
Only that having vigorously enforced patents creates a greater incentive<br>
on the part of inventors to pursue the patent process. By patenting, the<br>
invention specs are publicly available for study, so companies or<br>
indviduals needing a solution to a particular problem can find it if it<br>
is already invented. By paying royalties on use of the patent, they save<br>
money versus re-inventing the wheel, thus R&amp;D costs are saved. If the<br>
invention were not patented, and kept secret, such exchanges would not<br>
be possible, and R&amp;D would comprise a much larger percentage of<br>
production costs. Also, by having exisitng patents publicly available<br>
for study, the competetive frog-jumping effects I spoke of can take<br>
place, where companies can see how brand X does it, so they say, how can<br>
we do it better to be more competetive than they? THus R&amp;D moeny is<br>
spent on NEW research, rather than rehashing things already developed<br>
but kept secret.<br>
<p>
, Mr. Lorrey then calculates that the "relative<br>
<i>&gt; scarcity" of an invention is 4.55 million man-hours of labor.  By this</i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe he means to imply that this is an appropriate measure of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; value of an inventor's work, and further that he means to imply that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this income would not be obtained without patents.</i><br>
<p>
No, it is only to debunk your arguments that inventors get overpaid in a<br>
patent system due to the monopoly they can command for their device,<br>
that the work of inventors/creators needs to be more in line with that<br>
of other labor functions, which I am trying, by illustration of relative<br>
scarcity to show that since one patented invention is worth so many man<br>
hours of labor in terms of relative scarcity, not even to mention that<br>
man hours of labor are generic commodities, while every invention is<br>
unique, that even being stingy, an average invention is worth so many<br>
man hours. While we can say that not all inventions are worth anything,<br>
or are marketable, by filtering out "useless" inventions (while keeping<br>
all the useless work that occurs every day) this merely makes each<br>
useful invention MORE VALUABLE relativly speaking.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That is at least three independent claims.  The first (the value he</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculates) incorrectly assumes that patent=invention, thereby ignoring</i><br>
<i>&gt; the thousands of inventions that are never patented either because</i><br>
<i>&gt; their creators had no use for patents (high-tech and trendy things</i><br>
<i>&gt; often become obsolete so fast that waiting for and paying for a patent</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a waste of time and resources better spent on getting the thing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; market quickly), or because they couldn't find a sufficient market or</i><br>
<i>&gt; sufficient startup capital, or because they were invented by foreigners</i><br>
<i>&gt; for whom there was no US patent protection until the Paris convention</i><br>
<i>&gt; of 1884.  As a guess, I'd put the number of "inventions", not including</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the little things people build for themselves with no intention of</i><br>
<i>&gt; marketing, at least an order of magnitude higher.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The second claim, that the relative scarcity of a commodity is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; direct corrolation to its value, just ignores the demand side of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; equation.  It doesn't matter how rare your talents are if nobody has</i><br>
<i>&gt; any use for them.  An inventor, then, must use judgment and take some</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk in deciding how to invest his time so that his creations will</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a better chance at being valuable.  The best way to do that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably for him to do research under a capitalist patron, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalists live on their ability to judge investments.  An alternative</i><br>
<i>&gt; "strategy" (in a loose sense) is blind luck.  To happen upon a</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovery by accident--like the vulcanization of rubber--eliminates</i><br>
<i>&gt; the risk, and is a time-honored tradition, primarily because some</i><br>
<i>&gt; things were just to farfetched to have been discovered otherwise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, many chance discoveries resulted from basic research aimed</i><br>
<i>&gt; at other goals, so there was still speculation involved.  Because</i><br>
<i>&gt; that speculation takes capital, and its success is a major factor in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the success of the enterprise, it is the /speculation/, not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention, whose scarcity we most prize, and that should benefit the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most from the product.  When the inventor himself does it, he does</i><br>
<i>&gt; indeed reap the benefits, but usually it's a capitalist, and quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; rightly so.  He is, after all, paying the inventor's bills.  So the</i><br>
<i>&gt; relative scarcity of inventions to labor is no measure of value.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lastly, it is (presumably, but not explicitly) claimed that without</i><br>
<i>&gt; patents, the inventor would have insufficient incentive to create,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because he would be less likely to be rewarded commensurately with</i><br>
<i>&gt; his "value".  That invention happened before patents is still there</i><br>
<i>&gt; to challenge that idea,</i><br>
<p>
I never denied that people invented things prior to the USPTO, and am<br>
even acknowledging that prior to the USPTO and the American Revolution,<br>
patents and other intellectual property were handled by the Royal Office<br>
of Patents in Britain, though I am not particularly familiar with that<br>
system. What i am saying is that in an system where individual patent<br>
rights are rigorously enforced by government, irrespective of the<br>
relative wealth of the patent holder, that the quantity of patents<br>
pursued by individuals and companies goes up, which, due to the openly<br>
available patent information, helps accelerate technological advancement<br>
as described above. R&amp;D money is not wasted on replicated research.<br>
<p>
 but so too are all the other arguments I have<br>
<i>&gt; made before about other ways for an inventor (or patron) to profit</i><br>
<i>&gt; from his creations.  Mr. Lorrey elsewhere claims that his experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; of individual contracts being imperfectly honored in courts hampers</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of those methods.  But two wrongs don't make a right: if contract</i><br>
<i>&gt; law is broken, using the patent laws here in question to avoid that</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem rather than tackling the problem directly makes little sense.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And even if individual contracts are hard to enforce, most inventions</i><br>
<i>&gt; are made under the employ of large corporations who /do/ have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources to enforce their contracts with each other, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; sufficient for several of the methods proposed.  This is also moot</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the cases where an lone inventor, without contracts, can manage</i><br>
<i>&gt; to demonstrate an invention without giving away its secret, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; can then sell it to the highest bidder, and in the case where he</i><br>
<i>&gt; can choose never to release specs to the public at all, by making</i><br>
<i>&gt; money with the technology privately.</i><br>
<p>
And what is the possibility of making money with either method? I would<br>
say that the indvidual inventor can make much more money under a public<br>
patent system like ours than in private secrecy system, and is much less<br>
likely to be taken advantage of (with the exception of one, which I<br>
shall describe below.)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because there are many patentless methods to profit from technology,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and because a patentless system cuts research and developments costs</i><br>
<i>&gt; drastically, I simply don't see that a patentless world automatically</i><br>
<i>&gt; resigns inventors to poverty.  This is not a socialist argument that</i><br>
<i>&gt; inventors must sacrifice profits for the common good, or even a</i><br>
<i>&gt; left-libertarian argument that an inventor only "deserves" what he</i><br>
<i>&gt; can get without resort to force; it is a purely uncompromising</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalist profit-driven argument that the inventor himself, his</i><br>
<i>&gt; investors, and everyone else benefits more from a system that does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not restrict the unfettered exchange of ideas to whomever can most</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiently exploit them.</i><br>
<p>
In this case I would like to hear details of these sort of systems.<br>
Personally, I have had one invention seized by a defense agency and<br>
classified, so I cannot get a patent on it till it is declassified<br>
(meanwhile they and their contractors are using it to their glee). THis<br>
is my one caveat with the present system, and have been seeking methods<br>
to be able to keep the central secrets of my drive system secure without<br>
risking having the drive technology seized by Agent John Q.<br>
Stormtrooper, and still being able to produce products using the<br>
technology.<br>
