I just saw a tv show on the Discovery Channel on twins, where they<br>
showed that introversion and extroversion, at least in twins, was<br>
closely related to the relative rate of development between the fetuses<br>
in the womb. The faster developing one tended to be extroverted, while<br>
the slower one interoverted. There seems to always be such an imbalance,<br>
which starts when the embryo splits, as one of the new embryo's always<br>
has more cells in it than the other. Given this, I would say that such<br>
behavior is environmental rather than genetic, even though it may just<br>
be due to pre birth environmental factors.<br>

i was also quite introverted growing up, and did not begin to be<br>
sociable till Junior year of high school, and had a big stage fright<br>
problem up until I started my lighting business in Seattle in 1991.<br>
Doing presentations repeatedly got me out of it.<br>
