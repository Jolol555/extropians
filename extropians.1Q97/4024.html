I agree that in the real world applying Bayesian methods is hideously<br>
complex, with so many variable to consider (observational weighting,<br>
observers bias, publication bias, experimental error, non-quantifiable<br>
information, etc.)  But look at it this way: We have to use some kind of<br>
inference system.  What's the alternative?<br>
<p>
Also, the case against non-Bayesian methods is a bit stronger than you put<br>
it.  If somebody is using non-Bayesian methods it is always possible to cook<br>
up a set of bets such that the agent will accept each one but when you add<br>
all the bets together the risks cancel each other out and the non-Bayesian<br>
agent is guaranteed a loss.  This is called "Dutch book".  It can be applied<br>
to any system where the bets are quantifiable, which includes basically<br>
anything where money is involved (insurance, futures, stocks) and not just<br>
simple probablistic situations.  It's not that a Bayesian outcompetes a<br>
non-Bayesian in simple probability problems; it's that a Bayesian can take a<br>
non-Bayesian to the cleaners whenever money must be staked on an unclear<br>
outcome.<br>
<p>
The real-world defense against Dutch book is that in order to lure somebody<br>
into Dutch book you must be able to predict their inference process.  <br>
