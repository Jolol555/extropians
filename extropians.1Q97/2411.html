Well, I think the time has come to take my leave of this list.  The<br>
damage done by the Prozac has finally been repaired through a program of<br>
low self-esteem.  That means I have work to do, and this list has been<br>
taking up all my working time.<br>
<p>
I'd like to thank my friends on this list:<br>
The ones who kept me up to date on upcoming events;<br>
The ones who made moral accusations that I learned to counter;<br>
The ones who suggested alterations to my personality;<br>
The ones who forced me to speak clearly and slowly;<br>
The ones who told me things I didn't already know;<br>
The ones who crystallized my understanding;<br>
And above all, first and foremost:<br>
The ones who wrote arguments I hadn't already heard.<br>
<p>
Special awards to:<br>
Lee Daniel Crocker, "Most Reasonable, Coherent, and Clear";<br>
John K. Clark, "Most Interesting Disagreements";<br>
Anders Sandberg, "Most Saved Posts";<br>
Eugene Leitl, "Most Educational Person";<br>
Eric Watt Forste, "Most Unwavering Opposition";<br>
Damien Broderick, "Best Advice";<br>
And also:<br>
______________, "I'm Sure I've Forgotten Someone".<br>
______________, "And Probably Two Of Them".<br>
<p>
And to all the others, who were not strictly *necessary*, but still<br>
useful and fun to be with - thanks.<br>
<p>
I've written over 100 pages - not K, pages - of explanatory posts to<br>
this mailing list.  They'll make a fine set of Web pages someday.  I<br>
want you to know that, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have anything<br>
but nontechnical appeals to intuition when somebody asked me why the<br>
Powers wouldn't squish us like bugs, or what good the Singularity was.<br>
<p>
I hope that I've given more to this Extropian List than the total amount<br>
of effort put into it divided by the number of posting listmembers, or<br>
P.  I hope that for any given individual R, I have enlightened R by an<br>
amount greater than the amount that R has enlightened me (*).  I hope<br>
very strongly that I have repaid in equal measure any efforts directed<br>
specifically at me.<br>
<p>
[(*)  This is not, of course, possible for every person to do, and<br>
therefore more of an ideal than a serious (and seriously arrogant)<br>
goal.  Also, this does not mean that I have to enlighten the list as a<br>
whole to the same extent that the list enlightened me, which would<br>
require that I match the total creative output of everyone on the list. <br>
Duplicate enlightenments count, so that the same enlightenment among P<br>
listmembers is valued at E * P.]<br>
<p>
In short, I hope I put more in than I took out, and that in retrospect,<br>
every member of the list would have asked me to join.  Extropy, and<br>
capitalism, are supposed to work that way.<br>
<p>
I'm the fifth person to bail out.  I hope this doesn't start a<br>
stampede.  If it does start a stampede, I'm already stampeding and it<br>
was Lyle's fault.<br>
<p>
I intend to unsubscribe from the Extropian Mailing List completely after<br>
a few days, not just stop posting.  Messages sent here will not reach<br>
me.<br>
