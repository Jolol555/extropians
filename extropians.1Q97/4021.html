<p>
The new A thinks it is the new A.<br>
The new B thinks it is the new B.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Both are now faced with major problems.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Which one of us is married?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who goes to work on Monday,</i><br>
<p>
In my case the original probably does.<br>
Of course neither are the same person that existed in that past,<br>
but if I were the copy I would let the copied assume responsiblity <br>
for the past, unless it was not so inclined to do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;and who pays the income tax on it?</i><br>
<p>
Neither.<br>
My nationality does not require taxation.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;A is now so different from what A was before that it would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be as much of a change as becoming person C with no duplicate.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed, any change is as much change as needed to be a different person.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seems best to attempt to negotiate an </i><br>
<i>&gt;immediate non-competition agreement with your duplicate</i><br>
<p>
I have already agreed to that with my self.<br>
A copy would agree as well, at least momentarily.<br>
I would hope it would treat me with the same respect I treat my self.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If seems also useful</i><br>
<i>&gt;( if one's conscience permits ) to conspire to commit some profitable</i><br>
<i>&gt;crimes, because of the new alibi possibilities.</i><br>
<p>
What do you think actors are for? ;-)<br>
Actually I do not commit crimes.<br>
All I do is lawful, <br>
as I have jurisdiction over my self <br>
and legislate and execute laws freely.<br>
It is impossible for me to break my law.<br>
My law is the law of nature.<br>
