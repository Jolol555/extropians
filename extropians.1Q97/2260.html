<i>        &gt;Is there hope for the Meaning of Life?  And my conclusion: Yes [...]        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;My general conclusion is that engineering an ontologically objective        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;self-justifying goal requires solving both the First Cause and the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;hard problem of conscious experience. First, why engineering as     </i><br>
<i>        &gt;opposed to discovering? Because unlike the Universe and qualia, I         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;have nothing to point to for my "hard problem  of ethics."</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
In other words ethics are what we say they are. Even more that fire, ethics <br>
is the most important human invention, without it no other invention would <br>
be possible because we could not work together.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Second, why the First Cause? So that we can make objectively real         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;self-justifying things.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
One is a ridiculous number, so the idea that everything has a cause except <br>
for one thing seems very ugly and unsatisfying to me. That doesn't prove <br>
it's untrue of course, but I think it would be much more beautiful if lots of <br>
things had no cause, or even if cause and effect were in some sort of closed <br>
loop. I find it interesting that John Cramer's transactional interpretation <br>
of Quantum Mechanics does indeed blur the distinction between cause and <br>
effect.       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Third, why conscious experience? Goal requires purpose. Purpose         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;requires agent. Agent requires subjectivity. Therefore conscious         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;experiences or, more likely, an engineered variant thereof.</i><br>
                                         <br>
<p>
It doesn't bother me that in an absolute sense the world has no purpose,  <br>
because I don't think the question is even coherent, it's like asking  <br>
"How long is a piece of string?". When talking about meaning and purpose you  <br>
have to ask " purpose for who?". What is the purpose of a violin? To the <br>
manufacturer the purpose is to get a paycheck. To a drowning man its purpose  <br>
is to act as a life-preserver. To a musician its purpose is to make music and <br>
to his tone deaf child its purpose is to be used to be used as a club to swat <br>
a bug. To a rock the violin has no purpose at all. Nothing means anything  <br>
without an interpretation. This post doesn't mean anything, its  just a bunch <br>
of squiggles, until you use an interpretation, in this case the  rules of<br>
language. Change the interpretation and the meaning changes.    <br>
                                                 <br>

<i>        &gt;Depressing side-note:  Explains the Great Silence if all         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;civilizations achieve Singularity and commit suicide.  Better hope         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that intelligent life is really improbable or that lightspeed is an         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;absolute limit. Aren't wormholes and those newly discovered planets         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and life on Mars depressing?  </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Bacteria on Mars, if proven, would be a little unsettling, but there would  <br>
still be a very long way go from there to intelligence and technology. <br>
I don't  think wormholes or the speed of light is relevant, even in the <br>
unlikely event that we can never go faster than we can right now, we could <br>
still send Von Neumann probes to every star in the Galaxy in less than <br>
100 million years and transform it beyond recognition, and that's not much <br>
time on a Cosmological time frame.<br>
                      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If it all turns out to be meaningless, we can commit suicide at         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;leisure </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
Why should a meaningless Universe make me depressed? It is my sincerest wish  <br>
that I am correct and that the universe has no meaning, because then I would  <br>
be free to give it any meaning I want, otherwise I'm stuck with a meaning I <br>
may not like one bit.  For example, suppose for a movement that religious  <br>
people are correct and a Christian God does exist and the meaning of life is <br>
to praise him. Here we have an all powerful demon addicted to flattery who <br>
can read your every thought and will torture you, not for a long time, but <br>
for ETERNITY if you take one step out of line or break one of his many, many, <br>
rules, and that includes thought crimes. To make maters worse you're not even <br>
sure exactly what all his rules are, the "experts" all violently disagree, <br>
so you never know if you're going to be tortured or how to avoid it. Now this <br>
seems pretty depressing to me and not at all moral. I'll take an indifferent <br>
universe over a sadistic one any day.<br>
