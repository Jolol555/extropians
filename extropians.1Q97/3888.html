I Agree with Hawking whole heatedly.  If anyone wants to know about the<br>
after affects<br>
of human cloning,  you should be asking the millions of natural clones, <br>
not other outsider <br>
speculators who know nothing about the subject  but their own stupid<br>
silly  ignorance’s.<br>
<p>
Speaking from actual experience,  myself being a natural clone,  (being<br>
an identical  twin)<br>
I have experienced no bad or ugly side affects, physically,  emotionally,<br>
 or socially  from<br>
being born such. <br>
<p>
All laws and rules apply normally as they would any other person. If I<br>
have been endowed by<br>
my creator (by a man or otherwise) with a humanly functioning  brain,<br>
then  I am not the<br>
property of anyone but myself,  and neither is my human clone.  Once a<br>
human  life has it's<br>
own capable  identity  and human abilities,  it automatically becomes<br>
sovereign unto itself.<br>
If you are of the ones who don't think so,  just ask the human clone who<br>
it belongs to.<br>
<p>
Governments and Society in general  have already  bestowed all rights of<br>
any normal person<br>
to both of us human clones since birth, and we  have suffered nothing we<br>
are  aware of. <br>
All of the hoopla our society makes,  especially the religious sectors is<br>
rather childish and stupid,<br>
and far beyond silly.  There has been no God or gods who have condemned<br>
me or my clone for<br>
being two or more of the same,  and I have always felt fine about it. <br>
Actually,  I have felt privileged<br>
to have had such a wonderful  relationship with my clone.<br>
<p>
I personally challenge any (all) government leaders or religious leaders<br>
of any religion,<br>
or ethics dreamers (professional or not) to talk to me about human<br>
cloning from the standpoint<br>
of personal experience.   What it's all about, "being a human clone", <br>
and what the true actual<br>
consequences are,  and not the dreamed-up (in-their-head) consequences of<br>
little or  no<br>
account.<br>
<p>
 I've had nothing but a wonderful experience  being a best friend of<br>
someone else who has much in common with me,  and who looks just exactly <br>
like me<br>
so much so that most people have a hard time telling us apart for 40<br>
years.<br>
<p>
Yes it's true that many can't understand our connection or relationship<br>
bonds,  but<br>
if you think about it,  it's nobodies business to understand it except<br>
the two or more people<br>
in the relationship who have the bonds.  Such relationships are just as<br>
real and valid as any<br>
other friendship connection between two or more people who aren't  human<br>
clones.<br>
<p>
Whether my parents had made me by test tube cloning,  or by natural<br>
cloning, it really<br>
makes no difference. The science is similar,  except one can have more<br>
purpose.  <br>
It's the same thing in the end.<br>
