What I've always heard is that "politically correct" started as a joke<br>
among leftists who could take themselves not so seriously, about<br>
themselves, or about other leftists who didn't have as much humor.<br>
Then either the latter leftists took the phrase seriously and started<br>
using it or someone on the right thought the laughing leftists were<br>
using it as serious condemnation and things took off from there.<br>

Let the rumors breed.<br>
