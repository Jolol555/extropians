<i>&gt; [Re the kook who talked about the UFO in Hale-Bopp on Art Bell]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fraud is a felony, is it not? If so, the law in California clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; states that any deaths occuring during the the commission of a felony</i><br>
<i>&gt; are to considered homicides. Ergo, charge the bastard with murder.</i><br>
<p>
There is no fraud here.  Fraud is the act of using deceit to obtain<br>
consent from someone to a proposal of yours that materially harms<br>
them in some way.  The lunatic made no proposals to anyone--he<br>
wasn't selling tickets to the UFO, or telling anyone to kill himself.<br>
He was just spouting entertaining nonsense.  Just plain lying is not<br>
a crime.<br>
<p>
If we jailed people for irresponsible speech, we reinforce the<br>
illusion that most speech is responsible.  Every news report is biased,<br>
and based on bad evidence, and should be suspect.  The pretense of<br>
objectivity in the media does far more harm than a few kooks, because<br>
it causes our ability to spot the kooks to atrophy.<br>
