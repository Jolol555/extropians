In my last post, I declared that we *are* that which we are experiencing in <br>
this moment, that there is no division between the one experiencing and the <br>
experience itself.  After reading the responses to my last post, and after <br>
considering more deeply my understanding of things, I realize that what I <br>
wrote was much too superficial; there is much more to consider than just the <br>
fact that we *are* our momentary experiences.  We certainly are *that*, but <br>
there are aspects of ourselves which are present through many moments, which <br>
last longer than a sensation or a fleeting thought; aspects which are <br>
*influenced* by all the sensations and fleeting thoughts, but which persist in <br>
their own, stable ways.<br>
<p>
There are aspects of ourselves which change very quickly, such as the sounds <br>
we hear or the sights we see; colors and tones rise and fall, shifting with <br>
each moment; thoughts come and go, emotions surge and fade.  But there are <br>
other aspects which change more slowly; our personalities develop into <br>
somewhat stable habits of thought and action, changing, certainly, but <br>
changing slowly.  The basic patterns of human thinking and culture have <br>
persisted through many generations, our language and customs being passed from <br>
parent to child, maintaining their *basic* forms, even as they mutate in <br>
important ways.  Other aspects, such as the chemical processes of our cells; <br>
the duplication of DNA, the formation of protiens, the constant metabolism; <br>
these processes change *much* more slowly; the same basic *pattern* has <br>
spanned millions of generations.  Even slower to change is the behavior of our <br>
atoms;  they've been doing the same familiar dance for billions of years, <br>
altering their pattern of action very little, if any, since they first formed <br>
and settled into their habitual ways.  The Deep Regularities of Physics, so <br>
deep and so regular that we call them Laws, seem to change the slowest of all, <br>
if indeed *at* all, the slow background pattern underlying all the other, <br>
dancing patterns we call our universe.<br>
<p>
We embody *all* these changing patterns, from the constantly flowing barrage <br>
of momentary sensations, to the steady presence of the universe's underlying <br>
regularity.  Such a rich complexity of patterns, each built on a slower, <br>
deeper pattern; each building up, combining to form something new; happening <br>
upon new stabilities, drawing more coherent patterns out of the noise.  The <br>
unstable falls away, because of it's very nature, and that which is able to <br>
persist, does.  The evolution continues in its characteristically haphazard <br>
way, and all that persists are those processes which are able to sustain <br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
What are we?  We are this *process*.  All these levels of shifting patterns, <br>
interacting with each other to form the complex and transitory patterens that <br>
we are; some more transitory than others, but all of them changing.<br>
