<i>&gt; &gt;In a game like Quake from ID-Software you can play against "bot's".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Computer based adviseries made with Neural nets, fuzzy logic etc. At some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;time computergame characters will be as intelligent as other artificial</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lifeforms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;won't that make computergames against Bots/AI's illegal?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  No, simulating what would be a crime in meatspace doesn't necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause any harm to the software involved. It will probably be easier for</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploads to control the way they handle this kind of sensory input than</i><br>
<i>&gt; it will be to have a government define which simulations are bad.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think he meant to imply that playing the game itself would be<br>
immoral; that's just interacting with the sentient according to its<br>
nature.  But what about after the sentient game has been played for a <br>
few hours, learned about its opponent and about itself, and is aware<br>
of itself and what it has learned?  Wouldn't turning the machine off<br>
at that point be destroying a sentient being?<br>
