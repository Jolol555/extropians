An interesting point.  There shouldn't be any problems with owning your<br>
own genetic code in its entirety, but what about smaller portions?  It's<br>
been a while since I've studied genetics, but I believe there are<br>
tremendous amounts of reoccurring patterns in our exon DNA.  I'm not<br>
sure about the intron material.  It would be interesting trying to use<br>
introns as a type of PGP signature or copyright mark, but I'm afraid it<br>
would be too easily circumvented.  Any 'current' geneticists out there?<br>
<p>
Backtracking a bit, I wonder if it could be well argued for the parent's<br>
ownership of a child's code?  (Another factor for divorce court. . .) <br>
If the code is owned by each individual, would it be illegal for the<br>
parents to manufacture twins?<br>
<p>
Regarding ownership of one's one code:  If a clone was made by the owner<br>
(in this example one's self) and now two individuals owned rights to the<br>
code, as you've suggested, the legalities of one clone selling genetic<br>
information to another party might be interesting.  Also, what happens<br>
if an illegal (as defined by this example) clone were made?  Clearly it<br>
could not be denied its rights, could it?<br>
<p>
Finally, how long would one's genetic material remain under copyright? <br>
How long after death?  Depending on that answer, who owns the currently<br>
deceased?  If it is public domain, do we have the right to exhume their<br>
bodies and claim our property?<br>
<p>
It is unfortunate that these questions will have to be answered very<br>
soon and probably without much deliberation.  <br>
