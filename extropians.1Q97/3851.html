<i>&gt; &gt; Its odd that you and I can agree here but have different views on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; intellectual property. What I am proposing is that intellectual property</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be fully recognized as a basic human right (part of the natural law</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thing), possibly THE basic human right, and that patents, copyrights,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; trademarks etc are merely government recognition of individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exercising these rights in acts of creation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are asking far more than that; you are asking not only that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognize your right to use your creation, but that I further give</i><br>
<i>&gt; you the power to use force to prevent anyone else from using it, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; if it was independently created, or given freely.  You don't want a</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to use your mind; you want permission to use your fists to</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent me from using /my/ mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Now who is assigning motivations to whom? In a world where contracts<br>
between individuals are virtually unenforceable without corporations or<br>
politicians in your pocket (not too different from a pre-capitalist<br>
arisotcracy, eh?), what is to be done? We have free trade and open<br>
travel between our nation which does a pretty good job of protecting the<br>
fruit of one's labor, and nations like China etc, who share your ideas<br>
that individual have no right to protection of their ideas. China is<br>
hardly the sort of anarchists paradise I would think you dream of.<br>
<p>
While I am trying to make proposals to work within an existing system to<br>
maximize human liberty, you are sniping me from an irrational idealistic<br>
position that has frankly a snowballs chance of ever becoming real. <br>
<p>
Wanting intellectual property protection means that I want people to<br>
have to pay for the use of the fruit of my mental labor.  Without a<br>
government enforcing my copyright or patent, I have as little chance of<br>
protecting myself as ski areas do of protecting against frivolous<br>
lawsuits based on an agreement on a ski ticket. That is all the<br>
copyright info inside the jacket of a book is, really. if you are so<br>
fired up about making government uneccessary, do something about<br>
contract law and tort reform.<br>
<p>
BTW, I still don't see how a justice system can become competetive.<br>
Having competing court rulings in a case is merely grounds for war on<br>
the part of PPL's to enforce each party's ruling.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Property" is a human right by virtue of the objective nature of it:</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a piece of property cannot simultaneously serve the ends of two</i><br>
<i>&gt; different people.  If you want to expand that to include things that</i><br>
<i>&gt; /can/ simultaneously be used by everyone, then give me a /reason/, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; just your feeling that it is "natural".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That an intagible property like a book, program, DNA sequence, or<br>
invention can be reproduced and distributed makes your argument void, as<br>
two copies of a property can obviously serve the ends of two people at<br>
once. <br>
<p>
That we humans are intelligent, and can create new knowledge sets us<br>
apart and justifies our concept that we are more than just animals, we<br>
are animals that create newness. We add value, decrease entropy locally,<br>
by the brunt of our physical and mental sweat. If we are to maintain<br>
that all power is derived from the individual (as Jefferson, et al,<br>
stipulated), and not as a consequence of one person having a bigger gun<br>
(as Mao stipulated), we must ask, what is it about a person that is<br>
different from an average animal?<br>
<p>
I claim no supernatural or other external source of these rights, the<br>
fact that these concepts are, in the big scheme of things, merely<br>
created fictions, the fact that we concieved them, and can observe them<br>
in practice is demonstration enough of our uniqueness, and of the source<br>
of the power of the individual. What is it that makes each of us<br>
individuals? partly, it is our DNA, and partly, it is the ideas,<br>
thoughts, dreams, and experiences we as individuals go through on our<br>
own unique paths through life. because of this, these two things that<br>
make us individuals deserve and demand our full protection.<br>
