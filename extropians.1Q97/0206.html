<p>
I wouldn't want to say that the *only* kind of techno, or even good<br>
techno, is dance techno, I was just defending dance techno in itself. <br>
It is a specific form of music, dedicated to a specific kind of<br>
situation, which includes the use of drugs, and it is one of the great<br>
contemporary forms of popular music. <br>
<p>
Of course you can enjoy it without drugs, but you just won't get to the<br>
real heart and soul of it unless you've been on E or acid (preferably<br>
both) in a club. <br>
<p>
Nor am I saying anyone *has* to do this, or their life's not worth<br>
living!<br>
<p>
Re. the use of drugs: obviously a big subject, but I will say this. <br>
Millions of people have taken E since the 80s, probably even more<br>
millions have taken acid since the 60s. If moderate and sensible use had<br>
bad consequences, we would have heard of it by now.  While of course I<br>
respect your decision to leave them alone, I can only report that I have<br>
had no problems in the past 15 years, much joy, and many insights which<br>
proved valuable in the light of day.<br>
