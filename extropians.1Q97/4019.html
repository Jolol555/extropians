I had heard that he's dabbled in psi stuff, mostly as a result of being<br>
in the Bohm camp of quantum physics for several years, but his physics<br>
work has been rock solid and is well respected in the field. The fact<br>
that the same company that controlls Area 51 also has been backing his<br>
research is that some interesting connections are starting to come to<br>
light. In the papers out on the web, Hal has been actually a bit in the<br>
background, while Raisch has been the main name behind the work,<br>
probably as a result of concerns about his psi connections.<br>
