Well, yes, it is ubiquitous.  For starters, a large percentage of the US<br>
population believes the Bible is *literally* true, including such patently<br>
ridiculous ideas as the world being created only 6,000 years ago.  Most<br>
people think that a die is less likely to come up 6 if it has come up 6's the<br>
last 3 times.  Many people think that the Social Security Trust fund is<br>
significant when compared with Social Security's debt.  Most people think<br>
that when they buy a house they're "building equity", when in reality 98% of<br>
what they pay goes to the bank.  Most people believe that the greatest danger<br>
to their children is posed by strangers (when children are molested,<br>
kidnapped or killed, it's almost always friends or family).  I could go on<br>
forever like this.<br>
<p>
Further, look at the vehemence with which people defend their religious and<br>
political views.  Generally speaking, these aren't matters of fact as<br>
evidence is scanty, but people sure act like they are.  You're currently<br>
arguing with some of the list anarchists over just such an issue.<br>
