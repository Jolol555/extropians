<i>&gt;"Nothing gets justified...everything get criticized." [Bartley, 112]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pure Rationality seems to have become the ontotheological god or</i><br>
<i>&gt;absolute of Pancritical Rationalism (PCR). This Rationality can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;criticized, but it must be criticized with Rationality. Is this not</i><br>
<i>&gt;circular? PCR seems to be yet another failed attempt at removing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;authority, the authority being attenutauted very well in most areas, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;then magnified and exalted in Rationality. </i><br>
<p>
Well, criticizing rationality with irrational argument wouldn't seem to be<br>
a productive endeavor. But there is no circularity here, only a spiral of<br>
argumentation. Rationality can be used to criticize itself (as you are<br>
doing here), so it's not an "absolute" nor a "god". (I find your use of<br>
"god" here inappropriate and puzzling.) The PCR conception of rationality<br>
is an open one. Rationality is not an absolute, but a procedure that can be<br>
applied to itself to further refine reason.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"By replacing justificationism with fallibilism, and by encouraging the</i><br>
<i>&gt;practice of opening to, welcoming, and respecting criticism,</i><br>
<i>&gt;pancritical rationalism maximizes the pursuit of truth [...]" [More]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What is truth? It will take some effort to convice me that truth is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;a religious concept. This is another exogenous sublimation of god. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't think science can say anything about truth. You said, "nothing is</i><br>
<i>&gt;*provable* in science, only refutable". Is truth refutable? How do we</i><br>
<i>&gt;know that in our pursuit for truth that we have attained it or not?</i><br>
<p>
Science doesn't directly talk about truth, philosophy does. Science seeks<br>
to create and test hypotheses. Philosophy of science (or scientists *as*<br>
philosophers) can look at what science is doing and see that it is aiming<br>
at truth. How do we know when we have attained truth? My answer is that you<br>
generally do not know in any absolute way that you have attained truth.<br>
That's the point of pancritical rationalism. All propositions must remain<br>
open to challenge. Truth is an ideal at which we aim -- *if* we care about<br>
accuracy, honesty, and progress. I would say you can know that you have<br>
attained truth in some cases, but only if you take *know* to mean a<br>
contextual certainty, not an absolute certainty. In this sense I know that<br>
I am alive and male. If you throw out enough context through Cartesian<br>
doubt, of course I cannot be absolutely certain of this knowledge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;see a disparancy here between your thought and that of PCR. To overcome</i><br>
<i>&gt;authority, as PCR attempts to do, I think you might have to replace</i><br>
<i>&gt;"truth" with something like "the next most functional", or "the next</i><br>
<i>&gt;most useful". </i><br>
<p>
This is hopeless strategy. If you throw out truth as what you seek to<br>
approach, how can you have any standard by which to determine whether an<br>
idea or procedure is more functional or useful than another? Is it *true*<br>
that it's more useful? Or merely a matter of opinion?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;attain truth or meaning from science. </i><br>
<p>
If I were to adopt your strategy, I would now say: "Doesn't that sound<br>
dogmatic?"! <br>
<p>
How can you be so sure that we can't attain truth from science? (I didn't<br>
say anything about meaning and do not want to muddy the waters.) If all you<br>
mean is that, from the fact that a scientific theory has so far accurately<br>
predicted many things, we cannot be sure that the entities it describes are<br>
real in all respects rather than simply being close models of reality, I<br>
can agree. For many years it seemed like the hypothetical substance<br>
"caloric" explained heat transfer quite well. It also seemed that the<br>
Newtonian conception of intrinsic mass fit reality. For a while, these<br>
models apparently described reality, but they turned out to be incorrect.<br>
They were replaced by thermodynamics and relativistic concepts.<br>
<p>
However, from the fact that science cannot guarantee that its theories and<br>
theoretical entities perfectly describe reality, it does not follow that<br>
science *cannot* attain truth. It may attain it even though we may never be<br>
totally sure that it has. More importantly, science has to aim at truth to<br>
make progress.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;. Though rationality is certainly not inconsistent with your</i><br>
<i>&gt;system, I am going to attempt to criticize it while showing how it could</i><br>
<i>&gt;be augmented with other modalities of consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
I have never objected to *supplementing* reason with "other modalities of<br>
consciousness".Some of the points you make about the importance of<br>
emotional intelligence, of imagination and so on are fine. If you think<br>
those points are contrary to my position, you do not understand my view.<br>
Even science (let alone the rest of life) has a place for things other than<br>
reason: the creation of hypotheses can come from any source, whether<br>
"divine inspiration", inebriation, a relaxing, unfocused dreamtime in a hot<br>
tub, or whatever. BUT, reason is needed to structure and test the ideas<br>
generated. Good science is not done while in an unclear, undirected state<br>
of mind. The content of your hypotheses can come from non-rational and<br>
irrational sources, but they do not constitute remotely reliable knowledge<br>
until they have been tested according to the rigorous (though revisable)<br>
standards of reason and science.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"This optimism [Dynamic Optimism] is dynamic since it rejects any form</i><br>
<i>&gt;of passive faith." [More]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dynamic Optimism is the same as dynamic faith. </i><br>
<p>
No. Dynamic Optimism is the same as reason applied towards improving<br>
things. It does not involve dogma, unquestionable truths. So it is not<br>
faith, if by "faith" we mean (as I use it) "fixed belief in something in<br>
the absence or contrary to the evidence."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Contrary to faith, dynamic optimism recommends experimentation to</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncover the truth" [More]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How would esoteric religion have ever developed without embracing</i><br>
<i>&gt;experimentation?</i><br>
<p>
To the extent that it embraces experimentation it is not *faith*. The<br>
esoteric religions have more elements of critical experimentation and<br>
bodily and psychological technology than the exoteric religions, or strands<br>
of religion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Truth is of little importance. [...] Truth won't help me overcome my</i><br>
<i>&gt;needs and attain my desires. I have no desire to attain truth.</i><br>
<p>
In my experience, I cannot have a productive conversation with most people<br>
who say things like this. Those who reject truth as a goal and who want to<br>
limit reason generally see discussion as the clash of perspectives with no<br>
way of reconciling differences. However, I'm not sure that's the case this<br>
time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; No, religion is definitely not the foundation of science, and faith has no</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; role in science.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That doesn't sound like a statement that can be criticized. Very</i><br>
<i>&gt;dogmatic, but I believe I have done so above.</i><br>
<p>
This is unfair, Gregory. It would be dogmatic if I offered it on its own<br>
and unwilling to give a reasonable argument for it. However, I explained<br>
what I meant by that and referred you to extensive arguments for my view.<br>
Also, you say that the statement sounds like it can't be criticized but<br>
then admit that you just did exactly that. You can't have it both ways!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am not suggesting a return to primitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;concepts and modalities of consciousness, but rather a recursive and</i><br>
<i>&gt;transcending re-assimilation of them. We have greatly refined</i><br>
<i>&gt;rationalization, but its not enough. Just like an AI cannot understand</i><br>
<i>&gt;analogies, if we were merely rational neither would we. We are able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;understand obscure and poetic analogies because our memory makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;irrational associations based on feelings, emotions, and patterns of</i><br>
<i>&gt;sensation, as well as rational associations. </i><br>
<p>
Again, I'm not sure how much I disagree with you or agree with you. I have<br>
no objection to other modes of thought other than the rational (which is<br>
hard to exactly define and delimit anyway). What I do hold is that reason<br>
is the arbiter of ideas generated by other processes. I do* think emotions<br>
contain valuable information, imagination has enormous value, association<br>
and connotation play important roles in our thinking. However, all these<br>
processes are highly fallible and reason is needed to try to sort out what<br>
yields truth (or useful information) and what doesn't. So, for instance, I<br>
prefer Nathaniel Branden's views on the cognitive role of emotions to those<br>
of Rand who declared that "emotions are not tools of cognition." Although<br>
emotions should not serve as primary tools of cognition, I think Branden is<br>
correct that we can learn from listening to our feelings things that we<br>
might not discover by analytical thinking alone. But we still need to<br>
rationally consider, check, and integrate the information gained from our<br>
feelings.<br>
<p>
I will try not to get drawn back into this discussion, since I'm supposed<br>
to be working on my book. But it is an important issue to me, so perhaps I<br>
won't be able to resist!<br>
