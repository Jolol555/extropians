<i>&gt;  &lt;&lt; If you ask how many people whose opinions--in the absence of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;   direct experience of mine--I value so highly that I might actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;   re-examine my own ideas in light of their disagreement, then yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   there are very few of those indeed.  I see absolutely no reason</i><br>
<i>&gt;   why I should give any creedence at all to J. Random Ph.D. or</i><br>
<i>&gt;   John Q. Bestseller.  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with the first half of this - opinions that I value are hard to</i><br>
<i>&gt; find, indeed!  But as to questioning my own beliefs, I do it often and</i><br>
<i>&gt; with each new piece of information that I find.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, perhaps I could have worded that better.  How about "...cause me to<br>
question my previous reasoning from the same observations..."?  Of course<br>
beliefs change with new inputs, including new methods of reasoning that<br>
might come along.  We then apply our current best tools of reason to the<br>
facts as we see them, and draw tentative conclusions with which to make<br>
decisions.  But sometimes the conclusions we reach differ from those<br>
reached by someone else from the same premises and data.  In that case,<br>
one can either question the other's reasoning, your own reasoning, or<br>
the data.  There are a precious few people whose disagreement with me<br>
would motivate me to examine my own reasoning; it is those people to<br>
whom I referred.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, I do not like the emotional tone of sarcasm in reference to Ph.D.'s </i><br>
<i>&gt; or successful authors. I like to support the successes of other people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; excell, not put them down for being rewarded for it, in money or fame.</i><br>
<p>
I too support others who excel /for the right reasons/.  I spend probably<br>
$200 a month on books, but only those of authors who have earned my<br>
respect, and I want them to earn my money as well.  But I would no sooner<br>
buy a book by Jeremy Rifkin than I would castrate myself with a spoon,<br>
despite the fact that his sales outnumber those of, say, Friedman.  So<br>
success, by itself, is no measure of intellectual worth.  I do not "put<br>
down" successful authors, necessarily; I just refuse to grant them the<br>
accolades for it that others seem to. <br>
<p>
The same with academic degrees.  Knowing that someone has a Ph.D. is<br>
precisely as valuable to me as knowing that they own a cat.  I have<br>
nothing against cats--I have one myself.  I have nothing against those<br>
with degrees--my father and most of my friends have them.  I just don't<br>
give that piece of information any weight in judging the intelligence<br>
or character of anyone.  Actual accomplishments impress me more than<br>
empty credentials.  Getting a degree is hard work, but work does not<br>
equal accomplishment or ability or character.<br>
<p>
Before you ask, no, I don't have a degree, though I have attended<br>
college off and on.  I've been programming computers for 17 years, and<br>
never found any need to bother.  Yes, this probably affects my opinion.<br>
