This doesn't get you out of your contradiction. Certainly if words can<br>
be destructive of reason and counter to the goal of human progress, then<br>
words can hurt people.<br>

I think I'm being careful to reply only to what you have actually<br>
said, and not to my interpretation of it. Your last sentence above<br>
seems like a drastic oversimplification to me. Psychological<br>
causality is still very poorly understood, and I wouldn't be<br>
comfortable making such definite emphatic statements about it<br>
(unless I were trying to stir up controversy). It might be helpful<br>
here to distinguish between causation and responsibility. I can<br>
cause you to have certain emotions without relieving you of the<br>
primary responsibility for those emotions, and vice versa. If A<br>
goads B into a screaming fit of rage, we can hold B responsible<br>
for the screaming fit while still having reason to reproach A for<br>
A's verbal goading.<br>
<p>
I think I get the gist of what you are trying to say. The only reason<br>
I'm objecting is because I think you are overstating your case.<br>
