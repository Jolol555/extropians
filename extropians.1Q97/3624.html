<i>&gt; This is a compelling image, but I don't quite understand how this could wipe</i><br>
<i>&gt; out.  Gamma-ray bursts are very brief events and planets are excellent</i><br>
<i>&gt; gamma-ray shields.  The burst would sterilize half the planet but the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; half would be unaffected.</i><br>
<p>
It's not the gamma ray burst that would do it.  The gammas wouldn't<br>
even reach the ground; air itself is sufficient shield.<br>
<p>
What *would* do it is the relativistic particles that are expelled <br>
from the collision.  These are thought to be the source of the gamma<br>
burst (by folks building models of bursters at cosmic distances.)  <br>
These particles would carry much more energy than the gammas,<br>
and would arrive over a period of centuries (since the particles <br>
would not travel in straight lines, due to interstellar magnetic <br>
fields.)  They would induce radioactivity in the atmosphere and<br>
produce secondary particles that would reach the ground.<br>
