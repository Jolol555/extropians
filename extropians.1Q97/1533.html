<p>
I agree with the maximalization of our psyche's, let's see let me find the<br>
site....<br>
<p>
ok, as Max More wrote:<br>
<p>
"1. Dynamic optimism serves to motivate continuous personal transformation,<br>
and to sustain transformative efforts, conquering barriers and overwhelming<br>
discouragement during times of difficulty or weariness. <br>
2. Boundless expansion as a society provides the context required for us to<br>
sustain truly long-term personal progress, to provide energy, space, and<br>
the framework for the diversity implicit in individual self-transformation."<br>
<p>
(as long as this is done in  a balanced way without ruining the<br>
environment, I have no problem with this).<br>
<p>
"3. Intelligent technology in this context means directing science and<br>
technology toward the transcendence of our hitherto inherently limited<br>
abilities.<br>
4. Spontaneous order is an enabling condition, allowing each individual to<br>
pursue his or her self-transformation with minimal interference from others<br>
and to maximum mutual benefit from the resulting diversity. "<br>
<p>
Again as long as it is responsible to Gaia and other living life forms I<br>
agree with this.<br>
<p>
I agree with these principles.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in about 15% disagreement. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What parts?</i><br>
<p>
That there is no Divinity....that immortality is possible nor necessarily<br>
desireable.<br>
<p>
I think that the resistance that a lot of extropians have to the idea of<br>
Divinity is rooted in a Judeo-Xtian point of view of said Divinity.  I<br>
don't view Divinity as a transcendant being however, that is interfering<br>
with our lives, and judging our performance, etc. (like the Xtian<br>
monotheistic God).  I am not a Christian.  My view of Divinity is that it<br>
is evolving and we are part of that evolution...and that we are co<br>
creators....  Divinity is conscious through us and other self reflexive<br>
beings.  My view of Divinity is much more similar to hmmmm....Valentine<br>
Michaels Smiths?  :)  I am a panentheist.  I am also a polytheist....in<br>
that I believe that all beings are manifestations of Divinity....thus we<br>
are all God/dess, co-creators (who also mess up at times), and the universe<br>
is an infinite creatrix.  To me, it's this realization which allows us to<br>
become as fully actualized as possible.  <br>
Transhuman as it were.<br>
<p>
I don't really think it's that far off from Extropianism.  We just might be<br>
looking at the same thing through slightly different lenses.  I don't see<br>
why spirituality necessarily conflicts with the basic principles of<br>
extropianism.  In fact, my particular brand of spirituality engenders<br>
*more* responsibility for our evolvement and lives than less....If we are<br>
all Divine then we all have the potential to manifest anything we want.<br>
And we are ultimately responsible for what we manifest. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I can't understand the complete and utter rejection of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; such things as Shamanic or spiritual experience...   </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Spirituality doesn't have to mean dogmatism</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How about the complete an utter rejection of words  that are easily</i><br>
construed as being dogmatic?<br>
<p>
Why invent a new language?  People will always misinterpret.  Why would<br>
anyone construe the word Shamanic or Spirituality as "dogmatic"?  The first<br>
is an adjective the second is a noun.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The word spirit is easily misinterpreted  as many people have thier own</i><br>
idea of what it is.<br>
<p>
Er I didn't exactly say "spirit" but I guess it is implicit in Spirituality.<br>
Spirit - spiritus, latin for "breathe".  In my context, the essence of that<br>
which infuses life.  The energy that each being has.  Spirituality is<br>
getting in touch with that energy, working with it, and getting in touch<br>
with energy of other living things.  I may do this through ritual practices<br>
that are Shamanic in nature.  I may do it when I create something.  It<br>
really doesn't make much difference.  Why do I like ritual?  Because I like<br>
getting in that particular part of my consciousness.  IE...it's fun.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you can find scientific words that refer to things such as "soul" </i><br>
<p>
I'll use what words I choose to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I encourage you to use them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe soul refers to a concept of self.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree.  I think there is more to it than that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe I am what I know </i><br>
<i>&gt; (the sum of my knowledge, memories, experience, etc).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Therefore what contains my memories is my soul.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would be inclined to say it is my brain.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't minimalize all that you are to just your brain.  You are<br>
comprised of many organs, your body has intelligence, your heart has<br>
intelligence, your cells throughout your body communicate with each other.<br>
I think the brain is the pinnacle of the intelligence of your body, but it<br>
is not the only source.  Did you know your heart has it's own nervous<br>
system that interacts with the central nervous system?  That certain<br>
emotions, that are heart centered, like love, compassion, etc., actually<br>
increase your immuno response and help to calm and entrain your<br>
parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems?  That emotional<br>
"heartbreak" can actually cause physical scarring to the heart?  That<br>
people really can die of a broken heart?  Don't scoff...this is what 30<br>
years of research into cardiology has discovered.  I refered to site that<br>
does this kind of research in a previous post but if you are interested I<br>
will post it again.<br>
<p>
I really think that we are more than just the brain, wondrous enough as it<br>
is.  I think before we start thinking about removing organs that we fully<br>
understand why they are there and what part of "you" you are removing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you believe you will be reincarnated is it correct to say you will die?&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Probably not.  I should probably say recycled :)<br>
