<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;MOST OF THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS I HAVE MADE BEFORE. </i><br>
<i>&gt;LONG TIME READERS OF THE LIST MAY WANT TO SKIP THIS POST</i><br>
<p>
I HAVE ARGUED THIS BEFORE AS WELL.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;If I was standing on one side of the [duplicating] chamber and I</i><br>
now        <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;appeared to be on the other side of the chamber I would know I was</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;the copy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And if the chamber had cylindrical symmetry you could not tell if you were  </i><br>
<i>&gt;the copy or not. </i><br>
<p>
If I was standing in a cylinder with a red dot where the original was<br>
and a blue dot where the copy would be<br>
I could know who was the original.<br>
It is useless to argue about the design of the replicating chamber <br>
unless we are designing it.<br>
Do you want to do that?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Suppose that one second after you first saw your double, a bullet hit him in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the back of the head and his brain exploded. Regardless of whether you are </i><br>
<i>&gt;the copy or the original you still have all your memories and you still have </i><br>
<i>&gt;a feeling on continuity with your past, just as you do now, so nobody died.</i><br>
<p>
It's brain is dripping off the wall and it is not dead?<br>
Do you want to retract that?<br>
I would not be dead.<br>
It would( be brain-dead).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If two phonographs are synchronized and playing the same symphony and you </i><br>
<i>&gt;destroy one machine, the music does not stop.</i><br>
<p>
The music from the destroyed machine stops.<br>
I would not like to be the machine that stops playing music.<br>
The symphony of one machine is not the symphony of another.<br>
<p>
The music I would have been listening to would have stopped.<br>
It would have become a new sound.<br>
I would not be listening to the same music.<br>
I can distinguish between music in mono and stereo.<br>
Mono is not the same as stereo.<br>
<p>
I have tried synchronizing music before.<br>
I've had my fill of DJing and playing with mixing boards.<br>
Different machines play different speeds, different qualities,<br>
different waves, different sounds, different musics.<br>
If I stop spinning and another DJ replaces me <br>
it would not be my music any more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think our key disagreement is that you think we are an object, I think we </i><br>
<i>&gt;are a process. </i><br>
<p>
All objects are processes.<br>
All processes are objects.<br>
An action requires a thing to act.<br>
A thing requires action to exist.<br>
A particle is a wave.<br>
A wave is a particle.<br>
I try to make make no distintions between them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can make an exact copy of a this post,</i><br>
<p>
According to Frank Tipler "An exact copy is no longer a copy.<br>
It is the original.".<br>
In order for it to be the exact original it must not be a copy, <br>
it must have been the original all along.<br>
So any copy is not the original <br>
unless it phases into the original <br>
which would require it to have occupied the same position in space and time<br>
during it's entire existence.<br>
If I were to copy my self EXACTLY no thing would happen <br>
because two things can not occupy the same position in spacetime.<br>
There is only one me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;lots of copies may exist in the world, but they are all the same post.</i><br>
<p>
If they are the same they do not exist in several positions in spacetime.<br>
They are not the same.<br>
They are copies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can delete your copy, but I still have mine so the post still exists.</i><br>
<p>
Your post would still exist.<br>
My post would not.<br>
If I destroy my post and yours survives <br>
they are obviously not the same post.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It would be crazy to say that in order to get the most out of it </i><br>
<i>&gt;you should only read the original, there is no original, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and information does not occupy a unique position in space.</i><br>
<p>
I can understand that an original can not remain static <br>
in a dynamic equation.<br>
I would like you to prove <br>
that a thing does not occupy a unique position in spacetime.<br>
<p>
By the way, according to the United Nations' <br>
Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Article 1:<br>
All human beings are endowed with reason.<br>
There is not a human being which is crazy.<br>

<i>&gt;A brick can't be copied exactly, so it doesn't have these properties,</i><br>
<p>
What properties?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;thus it makes sense to talk about two different bricks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The fundamental question you have to ask yourself is; </i><br>
<i>&gt;are we more like bricks or symphonies?</i><br>
<p>
Compare:<br>
a brick is a symphony of particle interaction conducted by nature,<br>
a symphony is a solid performance or fails to be worthy of it's name;<br>
a brick may have it's parts thrown together haphazard,<br>
a symphony as such is called free-form jazz.<br>
<p>
How  different are a brick and a symphony?<br>
Know ye a difference between a hawk and a handsaw?<br>
That seems not a fundamental question to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not a thing. The word "I" should not be a pronoun but a adjective,   </i><br>
<i>&gt;an adjective modifying matter. I am not matter, I am  the way matter reacts   </i><br>
<i>&gt;when it's organized  in certain complex  ways.</i><br>
<p>
The play is the thing.<br>
Then you are an action, a thing.<br>
Dare ye question an action as being?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;As one billionth of a nanosecond passed they would have diverged.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why?  One billionth of a nanosecond is far too short for human consciousness </i><br>
<i>&gt;to detect. For people "now" is about a second long.</i><br>
<p>
We need not know for a thing to be.<br>
The smallest change is change.<br>
Do you disagree?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                    </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Location and structure is used to presently distinguish between them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You're in a different position than you were 5 minutes ago, but presumably  </i><br>
<i>&gt;your identity has not changed. </i><br>
<p>
Yet in shorter a span the heavens were made,<br>
1, 2, 3.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Trying to develop a theory of identity or  </i><br>
<i>&gt;consciousness based on position is a bad idea. </i><br>
<p>
Position is among an infinite quality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Where does consciousness exist?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Where does "red" exist or "fast" or "beautiful" or the number "13"?</i><br>
<p>
They exist where they do.<br>
Look, ho, I summon... "13".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;These questions have no answer because they make no sense.</i><br>
 <br>
Before you make sense of it the sense must be seen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;How many types of sub-atomic particles does it take to convince you </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;that all atoms are not all the same?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;An atom is not a bag of sub-atomic particles that occasionally releases its </i><br>
<i>&gt;contents, </i><br>
<p>
Does nothing enter an d nothing leave?<br>
Surely this way it has not always been.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;that would be like saying somewhere in the human body is a </i><br>
<i>&gt;"word bag" that gradually releases its contents as language, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and when it's empty we become mute.</i><br>
<p>
Your lungs hold no air that escapes gradually?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                                </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Mark my words. We will be more able to distinguish between atoms </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;eventually.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then most of the Physics done this century has been a waste of time.</i><br>
<p>
People waste time when they eat and they breathe,<br>
go to work, and they gossip, have sex, and they sleep.<br>
They race towards their grave <br>
with their eyes on their feet,<br>
they have continued to fall from their logic <br>
since long before this century. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;Me:  </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;In Science you can exchange one atom of Hydrogen with another one </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;and the system does not change at all.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Of course it changed, you just switched atoms. </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Switching is an action.        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;An action usually requires change.        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;At one time the system had atom A.        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;At another time it was -A.        </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;At another time it was -A + B.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you're right then The Identity Of Indiscernibles is false and so is most </i><br>
<i>&gt;Science done in the last 90 years, because the foundation of modern physics </i><br>
<i>&gt;is the idea of Exchange Forces, and that is a direct consequence of The </i><br>
<i>&gt;Identity Of Indiscernibles.</i><br>
<p>
Most physicists born within the last 90 years are no longer.<br>
Are they any wiser than me?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The first philosopher to examine the principle of "The Identity Of  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Indiscernibles" was Leibniz 300 years ago. He said that if there is no way  </i><br>
<i>&gt;to find a difference between two things then they are identical </i><br>
<p>
He has said it, so it must be?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;and switching the position of the objects </i><br>
<i>&gt;does not change the physical state of the system.</i><br>
<p>
If I place my heart in my hand does it not bleed?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Until the 20th century this idea had no observable consequences because </i><br>
<i>&gt;nobody could find two things exactly alike. </i><br>
<p>
There were no things alike just as Leibniz had seen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Things changed dramatically when  </i><br>
<i>&gt;it was discovered that atoms have no scratches on them to tell them apart.  </i><br>
<p>
How about if I scatch an electron off?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Suppose you're looking at two electrons, </i><br>
<i>&gt;you may think that you can find a difference in them, </i><br>
<i>&gt;because one is here and the other one is not.   </i><br>
<i>&gt;How do you know the particles are not changing positions? </i><br>
<p>
The world is moving and every particle on it is changing positions.<br>
What does that have to do with being able to tell <br>
if I am looking at one group of paticles or another?<br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Would the system be any different if they did?</i><br>
<p>
One bounces this way, one bounces that way, <br>
different reactions, yes they are different.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By asking these sort of  </i><br>
<i>&gt;questions and using The Identity Of Indiscernibles we can derive The Pauli </i><br>
<i>&gt;Exclusion Principle, and that is the basis of the periodic table,  and that  </i><br>
<i>&gt;is the basis of chemistry, and that is the basis of life. We can also </i><br>
<i>&gt;discover the fact that there are two classes of particles, bosons like  </i><br>
<i>&gt;photons and fermions like electrons.</i><br>

Am I going to have to disprove all that too?<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Experimentally we can't measure the quantum wave function  F(x) of a particle, </i><br>
<i>&gt;we can only measure the intensity of the wave function [F(x)]^2 because  </i><br>
<i>&gt;that's probability and probability we can measure. P(x) =[F(x)]^2 is the  </i><br>
<i>&gt;probability of finding two particles x distance apart. Now let's exchange </i><br>
<i>&gt;the  position of the particles, the distance between them was x1 - x2 = x is </i><br>
<i>&gt;now  x2  - x1 = -x . The Identity Of Indiscernibles tells us that because the  </i><br>
<i>&gt;two particles are the same, no measurable change has been made, no change in </i><br>
<i>&gt;probability , so P(x) = P(-x) . From this we see that [ F(x) ]^2 = [ F(-x)]^2  </i><br>
<i>&gt;so the Quantum wave function can be an even function [ F(x) = +F(-x) ] or an  </i><br>
<i>&gt;odd function  [F(x) = -F(-x) ] , remember (-1)^2 = (+1)^2 =1. </i><br>
<p>
Sorry, you lost me.<br>
If we are to communicate I suggest converting math into english.<br>
They can be converted.<br>
You are doing alot of things and I don't know y.<br>
There is 100% probability of finding two particles x distance apart <br>
when x is an unknown.<br>
If you exchange positions <br>
they are still the same distance from each other, so why bother?<br>
I don't see any change in x <br>
because I still don't know what x is.<br>
If I do not know what x is <br>
x might be even, odd, or neither.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Both solutions have physical significance, particles with integer spin,  </i><br>
<i>&gt;bosons, have even wave functions, particles with half integer spin , fermions, </i><br>
<i>&gt;have odd wave functions. If we put two fermions like electrons in the same  </i><br>
<i>&gt;place then the distance between them, x , is zero and because they must  </i><br>
<i>&gt;follow the laws of odd wave functions , F(0)  = -F(0)  but the only number  </i><br>
<i>&gt;that is it's own negative is zero so  F(0)  =0 . What this means is that the  </i><br>
<i>&gt;wave function goes to zero and  [F(x)]^2  goes to zero , thus the probability  </i><br>
<i>&gt;of finding two electrons in the same spot is zero, and that is  The Pauli </i><br>
<i>&gt;Exclusion  Principle.</i><br>
<p>
You are saying <br>
when the distance between two things is 0 there are not two things.<br>
I must sincerly agree.<br>
The trick is that you can't put two particles in one spot, <br>
unless the spot is made of more than one particle.<br>
Particle A = spot B, particle C = spot D.<br>
A+C=B+D (2 particles and 2 spots).<br>
Spots have to be made of something.<br>
