As I was considering the way that the United States is trying to restrict <br>
export of cryptographic algorithms, I was thinking about the guy who <br>
distributed PGP anyway, in spite of the laws against doing so.  He got in some <br>
trouble for doing so, but what if he had distributed it over the Internet, <br>
through anonymous remailers, so no one would know who sent it?  All he really <br>
has to do is get it to someone outside of the United States and let *them* <br>
distribute the software far and wide.  As far as I see it, the United States' <br>
ban on the exportation of encryption algorithms is a hollow sentiment.  People <br>
in the U.S. who have developed encryption algorithms, who want to export them <br>
can simply send them (encrypted, of course) through the Internet, via <br>
anonymous remailers, to their friends in other countries, who can distribute <br>
them from there, outside the jurisdiction of the United States.  If they want <br>
to sell the software commercially, all they have to do is work with friends in <br>
other countries, who will do the distribution and selling of the software, as <br>
business partners.<br>
<p>
Is it really as easy as I think it is to walk right through the United States' <br>
encryption ban?  Or am I missing something?<br>
