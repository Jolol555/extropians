[Saith Eric Watt Forste, to Lee Daniel Crocker:]<br>
<i>&gt; (I'm also quite curious as to what you mean to refer to by the phrase</i><br>
<i>&gt; "mental energy", but this would probably be muddying the issue.)</i><br>
<p>
Well, originally mental energy was thought by Freud to have a direct<br>
neurophysiological correlate.  Nowadays it's generally used as an<br>
extensional referent to certain feelings; my guess is that the feelings<br>
are the phenomenal aspect of the "value" slots of our goals.  High value<br>
- high mental energy, go out and do it; low value - low mental energy,<br>
just stay home.<br>
<p>
Of course mental energy has many origins, which is to say that there are<br>
a whole host of things which affect the "value" slots of goals (be<br>
careful, because what we perceive as the value of a goal is generally<br>
its "justification" slot).  Caffeine, for one.  In any case, I wish to<br>
avoid a fruitless riffling-through of all the things that other people<br>
think give rise to the feeling of mental energy, and simply state that<br>
my hypothesis assumes these other things to cause, say, an alteration in<br>
brain chemistry (high serotonin levels?) which raises the effective<br>
level of the "value" slot, which gives rise to a phenomenal experience<br>
of mental energy.<br>
