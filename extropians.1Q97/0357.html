Two points combined into one post:<br>
<p>
In re the spatial ability discrepancy that T.O. Morrow points out, I <br>
read a reference to an interesting study done by a cognitive <br>
researcher who wanted to find out why that might be.  He focused on <br>
the early development of children and found that the boys were <br>
encouraged to engage in sports that involved running, throwing and <br>
catching while the girls were encouraged into quieter activities, and <br>
so the women as they get older end up with lesser spatial abilities.  He <br>
predicts that as more and more girls enter into sports as young women <br>
we will see an evening out of this discrepancy and probably better <br>
math performance among women.<br>

Michael Lorrey:<br>
<i>&gt;Since when are SAT scores discredited Kathryn?</i><br>
<p>
The SAT test has been revised so many times and the scoring system <br>
for it weighted so many times that many in the education field <br>
believe it has lost whatever measurement value it once claimed to <br>
have.  At any rate, open up any Princeton Review manual, and they <br>
immediately state that the SAT, LSAT, GMAT, etc. basically measures <br>
your ability to take a standardized test.<br>
