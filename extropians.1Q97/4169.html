<i>&gt;Under the hunter-gatherer conditions in which our ancestors lived for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;past seven million years, a typical person only knew a hundred or so other</i><br>
<i>&gt;people.  Half of those were kids, and half the adults were stupider than</i><br>
<i>&gt;average.  The chance of coming up with a good idea that nobody else had</i><br>
<i>&gt;thought of was much higher than it is today.  Thus, the likely reward of</i><br>
<i>&gt;doing something most people thought was a bad idea was bigger than it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;now.</i><br>
<p>
But all the adults were citing the accumulated knowledge of centuries or even<br>
millenia.  The Australian aborigines' Dreamtime techniques have apparently<br>
preserved knowledge of geographical features from the last Ice Age.  So<br>
you're not competing just with the few dozen currently living adults, but<br>
also the thousands of dead ones whose ideas and experiences are preserved in<br>
oral tradition.<br>
<p>
The punishment for a wrong idea was much more likely to be death.  In our<br>
benign society you can make a lot of boo-boos and come out OK.  Without<br>
savings, medical care, charity, etc., and in an environment with many more<br>
hositles, even minor mistakes could be fatal.  So the cost was very much<br>
higher and cost-benefit, on the whole, was worse.  <br>
<p>
In point of fact, "primitive" cultures are typically very conservative, and<br>
their members are typically very conservative as well.  This is part of the<br>
reason they have such trouble when pitched into contact with developed<br>
societies.<br>
