<i>&gt; was called a racist.  For stating that I don't worship anything, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; was reviled as heartless and cold.  For wishing that people could</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My friends repeatedly urged to me to get out of this bad situation and</i><br>

<i>&gt; relate to the concept of transhumanism, but they at least support me in</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to pursue it, and they will listen to me when I talk about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Realistically, only another transhumanist is going to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; relate on that level, and I hope that the Internet lists and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; efforts of the Extropy institute will aid in everyone finding ways to</i><br>

I know it's disheartening to have the negativists affect your personal<br>
acheivements in such a direct manner... We extropians rarely expect get<br>
a unanimous "aye" from any comittee as far as our beliefs are concerned<br>
- but when negativists impede your acquisition of a degree, that can be<br>
a real downer! I've been there (trying to earn a degree) and have not<br>
handled it well. <br>
In the coming months and years, as reality comes closer to our visions<br>
of the future, we should expect stepped-up attacks from the mortalist<br>
side of the isle: luddites, Malthuseans/earth firsters, religionists,<br>
control freaks, Institutional media, etc..  It'll be one big Pre-Mortem<br>
Fiesta!<br>
But they will have the least effect on the long-term results.  I beleive<br>
that each person falls into one of three groups:<br>
<p>
1)  Those of us who actively work for and beleive in the transhuman<br>
ideas and ideals (immortalists): A small minority of the population.<br>
<p>
2) The people who truly fear advances in technology, freedom and culture<br>
along extropian lines (mortalists): a minority of the population<br>
(perhaps currently larger than the extropian segment).<br>
<p>
3) Those who, deep inside, aren't sure so they either stay quite or <br>
mimic the attitude of the day. IMO, the majority.<br>
<p>
Both (2) and (3) above can put temporary brakes on advances but the<br>
saving grace is population (3)'s "seeing-is-believing", "show me the<br>
money" attitude.  Their philosophy/non-philosophy is a damper but when<br>
economic and life-enhancing results are in, they'll put their money and<br>
their organs where their life is.<br>
<p>
Just think about what will happen when the AARP and the baby-boomers are<br>
one and the same.  Scientific research in the 40's, 50's, and early<br>
60's  seemed to focus on child immunization, birth defects, and other<br>
newborn/early childhood ailment. In the 60's, 70's, 80's and early- to<br>
mid- 90's it was Sexually transmitted diseases (AIDS in the latter part<br>
of this period), drug &amp; alcohol treatment, and workplace disorders. <br>
Already we are starting to see the shift toward cancer, heart problems,<br>
memory disorders, bone problems and mobility issues of the aged.  People<br>
will be lighting candles, wearing ribbons, and sewing together quilts to<br>
bring to light these "new" "Crises that society will no longer be able<br>
to ignore".<br>
<p>
Like it or not, not only will people start accepting our ideals...<br>
"society will demand it"! Gov't funded of course. Social Security (tax),<br>
Medicare (tax),Precious Gift (organ selling, donation, cloning,<br>
transplant market tax) Second Chance (cryo-fund tax).<br>
<p>
Transhumanity/Immortality may not come the way we want it nor the way we<br>
expect it. Not just from extropian acheivements but those of others as<br>
well.<br>
