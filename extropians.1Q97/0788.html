<p>
<p>
Dennett says "I for one would love to see it vindicated. That does not make <br>
it true, of course".  Evolution is more like History than Mathematics,<br>
and there are many very reasonable things in History that never happened.<br>
<p>
The diving reflex of infants, and the subcutaneous layer of fat humans have<br>
that is similar to that found in some aquatic animals is the best evidence<br>
for the Aquatic Ape Theory, but I don't think that's enough to prove it and I<br>
have a lot of problems with the other "evidence".<br>
<p>
I doubt if our lack of hair has anything to do with living in the water.<br>
Beavers, otters and seals are far more aquatic than we are and they have far<br>
more hair too. I think there is another reason we're bald, we invented cloths.<br>
Humans are much better at getting rid of waste heat than any other large<br>
animal, and that's because we have sweat glands on every part of our skin,<br>
and that's because we don't have a permanent coat of hair. One of our first<br>
inventions must have been the coat, when it's cold we put it on, when it gets<br>
hot we take it off, other animals can't do that, they must ware their coat,<br>
hot or cold, all the time.<br>
<p>
One of the greatest mysteries in Human evolution is why we walk on two legs.<br>
Despite claims to the contrary I don't think The Aquatic Ape Theory sheds<br>
much light on this question.<br>
<p>
Being a biped is no advantage in swimming, many mammals are much better at it<br>
than we are and they never came close to developing bipedalism. It is not at<br>
all obvious that living on the shoreline must encourage the development of<br>
longer legs. Yes, some wading birds have long legs, but the hippopotamus is<br>
aquatic and it has short stumpy legs, and dolphins and whales have no legs at<br>
all. Actually I can't think of any aquatic mammals that have long legs, much<br>
less find one that is bipedal.<br>
 <br>
Well OK, It might be a slight advantage in wading, but not much. It's very<br>
difficult to walk in water over a foot deep for any distance, almost<br>
impossible if it's over 2 feet deep, especially if you're only a little over<br>
4 feet tall, as an early ancestor like Lucy was. Why a slight advantage in<br>
wading is more important than running swiftly on land, or even swimming,<br>
the theory does not make clear.<br>
                                                                    <br>
We known for sure that bipedalism developed about 3 and a half million years<br>
ago, the question is why. We are not lacking in theories, there are a<br>
thousand theories to explain why bipedalism evolved, and that's the problem,<br>
we don't need a thousand theories we just need one, the correct one.<br>
