Squirrel sez:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
Thus one can make a parallel<br>
case -- I don't say a completely convincing one -- that we are<br>
obligate social beings, who require (in the sense of natural<br>
selection) a cooperative society at least as large as an extended<br>
family or perhaps a small band.  (Hmn, that line of reasoning might<br>
not be popular among extropians, but what's a squirrel for if not to<br>
chatter obnoxiously and hurl nuts...)<br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
Pardon me while I "riff":<br>
<p>
It strikes very near the heart of one of my primary concerns these <br>
days. It's also worth noting that any reasonably-thorough reading of <br>
_The Evolution of Cooperation_ will point up close correspondences to <br>
Robert Anton Wilson's "Communication is only possible between equals" <br>
meme.<br>
<p>
Just talking about the _E of C_ stuff, not selfish genes:<br>
Sharks don't have to care about cooperation. To have cooperation make <br>
sense, you need to have (some, but not too much) memory, <br>
accountability, and (the expectation of) an ongoing series of encounters <br>
with "the same" counterparts. Accountability implies rough parity of <br>
defensive and offensive resources, to provide reward/punishment; the <br>
reward/punishment both have to _matter_, without being _fatal_.<br>
<p>
I suspect that another strong parallel exists with simple statistical <br>
results that show why "fish schooling" works.<br>
<p>
I want enough elbow room, enough comrades and enough spare time.<br>
  The elbow room--I probably don't have to explain that;<br>
  the spare time--ditto;<br>
  the comrades are so I can take a nap and not worry overmuch about <br>
      who's tending the fire and <br>
      will I wake up with my throat cut.<br>
<p>
These all seem human traits--or preferences--that exist rather a priori <br>
in much of the population. And I like them fine. Some others, I'm not <br>
so fond of. I remain to be convinced that I know what's baby and <br>
what's bathwater, and I am suspicious of those who say they do.<br>
<p>
(po) how does one keep a "does not work and play well with others" <br>
transhuman from bopping off, eating a galaxy or two and coming back <br>
around to play bully/eat one's brain?<br>
<p>
Squirrel on, dude, you appear to be chittering my dialect.<br>
