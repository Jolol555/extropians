The idea of creating a virtual reality environment with different mathematical <br>
properties than ours was brought up, such as one where 1+1=3.  Mathematically <br>
speaking, the operation of addition is simply a function, taking a set of two <br>
input numbers and mapping it to a third.   We actually could get more abstract <br>
about this, and talk about any types of sets and their mappings, but it's <br>
unnecessary for this discussion.  The way that this function maps these two <br>
numbers to a third number can be fairly arbitrary.  So, 1+1 *can* = 3, if we <br>
define '+' appropriately.<br>
<p>
It just happens, that in our daily experience, there are certain patterns we <br>
notice about quantity.  For most solid things, if we take one of them and then <br>
another one of them and put them together, we have two of them together.  If <br>
we take three of them and four of them and put them together, we have four of <br>
them together.  So, we notice a certain pattern to the two numbers we bring <br>
together and the resulting sum.  This pattern is just a feature of the typical <br>
objects we deal with.  And we're so used to dealing with "objects" that have <br>
those properties, that it's difficult for us to imagine a world that didn't <br>
have those properties, since we tend to automatically imagine things in terms <br>
of objects, and objects do indeed have those properties.<br>
<p>
Now, if we have something like drops of water, and we take one of them and <br>
another one of them and put them together, we still have one drop of water.  <br>
If we take one cloud and another cloud and put them together, we still have <br>
one cloud.  Drops of water and clouds aren't really objects, so they don't <br>
have all the properties of objects; thus, there is no reason to expect them to <br>
have the same sort of mathematical properties that objects have.<br>
<p>
Whenever we deal with a world that has traditional objects in it, the rules of <br>
arithmetic, as we know them, will apply.  If we're talking about virtual <br>
reality and the set of all possible sensory worlds, then nearly all of them <br>
will be very different than ours and the minds which develop in the sensory <br>
systems which experience these sensory worlds will develop different forms of <br>
mathematics than we have.  In some, something as basic to us as set theory may <br>
not apply at all, especially if there are no objects in that world and no sets <br>
of "things".<br>
<p>
We have such persistent concepts of objects because they are so much a part of <br>
our daily experience.  There are certain sensations which persist in our <br>
sensory environment,  sensations which we come to recognize and group together <br>
as an object.  If I pick an object up and turn it in my hand, it looks similar <br>
from slightly different angles, and that similarity throughout the turning, <br>
where as I turn it, it doesn't change radically over the course of small <br>
angles, draws all those different perspectives together, and I think of that <br>
set of sensations as an object.  There is a certain "coherentness" about it.  <br>
There is also the fact that different features on it tend to be in the same <br>
relative position to each other and move together (if one feature moves up, <br>
the other ones move up also)<br>
<p>
I can imagine (sort of, anyway) worlds where there was just a lot of flowing <br>
images and sounds and there were no objects.  Regions of color may come <br>
together or split up and swirl around with other colors and mix in interesting <br>
ways.  The user could influence their sensations in certain ways, using a data <br>
suit to input.  They would have no bodily representation, like we have here, <br>
but they would have influence over what they experienced, and they would <br>
explore that, like babies explore their influence over their sensory worlds, <br>
and start finding general patterns in it.<br>
<p>
Some of the patterns we have found in our sensory worlds are the patterns of <br>
objects, of sensations that consistently go together.  These objects relate to <br>
each other in certain, consistent ways, and we can construct an arithmetic, <br>
based on this.  Other sensory worlds would have different underlying patterns, <br>
and the minds experiencing them would think in terms of those patterns.<br>
<p>
I don't know if a world could be constructed where 1+1=3, where the numbers <br>
represented the number of distinct objects.  I think if there are objects, <br>
like we have here, then the arithmetic will have to be the same.  But our kind <br>
of objects are certainly not the *only* kind possible.<br>
