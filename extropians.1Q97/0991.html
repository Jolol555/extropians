In a message dated 97-01-21 10:01:48 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; In this we can look at the Christianity meme as a model. Granted that it<br>
 is seen as outmoded or corrupted at this point in time, however in its<br>
 days of origin, and through most of its history, it has been seen as TOO<br>
 HIGH of a moral standard for mortal men to achieve. IMHO it is due to<br>
 this unreachable expectation that has ensured its longevity, and bodes<br>
 ill for extropy if our goals are achieved too quickly.<br>
 --  &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
This is an interesting point, but is it not the ambiguity and altruism of<br>
Xtianity that make it unlikely for mortal man to achieve, and not the<br>
absolute "goodness" or moral purity?<br>
<p>
Even if Xtianity had some good memes to begin wiht, it's certainly easy to<br>
see how perverted it is now, and that the appeal is a sick kind of denial and<br>
a need to control.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the thread is more about how philosophies that teach one to pass the<br>
buck; sitck with dogma and irrationality etc. - become popular more quickly<br>
than <br>
philosophies that teach hard work, reason, and self empowerment.<br>
