I'd like to thank Davin C. Enigl &lt;enigl@aol.com&gt; for the obvious time <br>
he took in writing his last post on this subject.  I apologize for the delay <br>
in replying, I had to look up a few things.  <br>
<p>
I have contended that our government announced that the virus later <br>
re-named HIV was the probable cause of AIDS in advance of the <br>
publication by Gallo of his evidence.  The press conference announcement <br>
was on April 23, 1984, Gallo published in Science over a week later.<br>
<p>
You said I was conveniently forgetting about an article Gallo published in <br>
Science in 1983.<br>
<p>
I pointed out that in 1983 Gallo was arguing that HTLV-I caused AIDS, <br>
and that HTLV-I, not the virus later named HIV, was the focus of <br>
Gallo's 1983 article.<br>
<p>
You countered that Gallo was careful not to emphasize the HTLV <br>
sub group 1 over any of the other HTLV family in the quotes <br>
I cited from the article:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Davin C. Enigl &lt;enigl@aol.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He says HTLV-like virus and does NOT say HTLV-I</i><br>
<p>
I thought I remembered Gallo singling out HTLV-1, and returned to the <br>
library [this time commandeering a microfilm reader that had a printer!]. <br>
Gallo did emphasize the HTLV sub group 1 over the other retroviruses <br>
of this family in his 1983 paper:<br>
<p>
"Virus from the U.S. patient was isolated and characterized and shown <br>
to be related to HTLV subgroup 1.  Whether or not HTLV-1 or other <br>
retroviruses of this family with T-cell tropism cause AIDS, it is possible <br>
that patients from whom the virus can be isolated can also transmit it <br>
to others."<br>
<p>
"...the slopes of the competition curves in homologous RI-PA's for p24 <br>
in cell extracts from both cell lines were very similar to those for p24 from <br>
isolates of the HTLV-1 subgroup, indicating that the isolate from patient EP <br>
is closely related to the HTLV-1 subgroup.  By this assay the new isolate <br>
appears to be less closely related to the HTLV-II subgroup. Analysis of the <br>
nucleic acids of the HTLV isolated from EP also indicated its similarity to <br>
viruses of the HTLV-1 subgroup."<br>
<p>
[all above quotes from Gallo, R.C., P.S. Sarin, E.P.Gelmann, M. Robert-<br>
Guroff, and E. Richardson.  Isolation of human T-cell leukemia virus in <br>
(AIDS). Science 220 (1983): 865-867.].<br>
<p>
Gallo himself acknowledged in his November 1986 sworn declaration <br>
before the USPTO, that in the Spring of 1983:<br>
<p>
"...our thinking at the time was that the AIDS virus was likely to be a close <br>
relative of HTLV-1" [Declaration of Robert C. Gallo, 11/8/86, p.10].<br>
<p>
The virus that the Institute Pasteur (IP) isolated, which Gallo later either <br>
misappropriated or contaminated his own samples with, first called "LAV" <br>
[for lymphadenopathy-associated virus] appeared to be distinctly different <br>
from the known human retroviruses, HTLV-1 and II. As the Staff Report <br>
on Oversight and Investigations Committee on Energy and Commerce of <br>
the US House of Representatives reported:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"During the first critical months of research on HIV, the work of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology [LTCB] scientists was far behind that of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the scientists at the Institut Pasteur [IP].  The reason the LTCB scientists </i><br>
<i>&gt;lagged behind was a misplaced focus on the "HTLV" family as the probable </i><br>
<i>&gt;source of the cause of AIDS.  Not only did this incorrect focus misdirect the </i><br>
<i>&gt;work of the LTCB scientists, for a time it misdirected the work of much of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the scientific community, due to Dr. Gallo's preeminent position vis-a-vis </i><br>
<i>&gt;human retrovirus research.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In early 1983, scientists at both the IP (Montagnier et al.) and LTCB </i><br>
<i>&gt;(Gallo et al.), searching for the cause of AIDS, attempted to isolate a </i><br>
<i>&gt;retrovirus...from AIDS patients....Dr. Gallo's early theorizing about the </i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS virus mistakenly placed that virus in the "HTLV" family (see, e.g., </i><br>
<i>&gt;Medical World News, August 14, 1982, p9).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;By Dr. Gallo's own admission (see below), his misunderstanding of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;fundamental nature of the AIDS virus associated with the mistaken belief </i><br>
<i>&gt;that HIV was an "HTLV" resulted in significant confusion and delay in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;work of the LTCB scientists.  Even for years after HIV had been discovered </i><br>
<i>&gt;and its true defining features identified, Dr. Gallo fought a losing battle to </i><br>
<i>&gt;keep the AIDS virus in the "HTLV" family by retaining the name "HTLV-III" </i><br>
<i>&gt;rather than HIV.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The IP scientists recognized early on that their virus, first called "LAV"</i><br>
<i>&gt;...appeared to be distinctly different from the known human retroviruses, </i><br>
<i>&gt;HTLV-I and II.  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Meanwhile, throughout all of 1983, the only contribution the LTCB scientists </i><br>
<i>&gt;made to the scientific literature and dialogue concerning possible causes of </i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS was to reiterate that "HTLV" was "...a very attractive candidate" </i><br>
<i>&gt;(Gallo remarks at 7/18/83 meeting of the NCI AIDS Task Force)."</i><br>
<p>
[This draft Staff Report of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation <br>
of the Energy and Commerce is now available at<br>
<a href="http://www.nyx.net/~wstewart/CelebratedCases/GalloCase/GalloCase.html">http://www.nyx.net/~wstewart/CelebratedCases/GalloCase/GalloCase.html</a>]<br>
<p>
As Celia Farber wrote in an article in the June 1992 issue of Spin titled <br>
"Fatal Distraction":<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"By 1983, he [Gallo] was publishing papers trying to convince his peers </i><br>
<i>&gt;that it [HTLV-I] also caused AIDS..."The whole thing about HTLV-I </i><br>
<i>&gt;and AIDS was ridiculous, but nobody would say a word against </i><br>
<i>&gt;Bob Gallo," recalls Dr. Sonnabend [a pioneering AIDS researcher and </i><br>
founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AMFAR)]<br>
<p>
I still maintain that a fair reading of the evidence indicates that in 1983,<br>
Gallo was advocating HTLV-I, or a close relative [not LAV, <br>
later renamed HTLV-III by Gallo] as the etiological agent in AIDS.  <br>
<p>
Some other points:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Davin C. Enigl &lt;enigl@aol.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Because 33 AIDS patients were positive for retrovirus (HTLV-like) </i><br>
<i>&gt;this was very strong  evidence an HTLV class virus is involved. </i><br>
<p>
Gallo reported "...the viral genome of HTLV was found to be integrated into <br>
peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA in 2 of 33 AIDS patients tested thus far..." <br>
He didn't say all 33.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Fallon:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"Since HTLV is endemic in southern Japan, the apparent lack of epidemic </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;AIDS in this region may argue against a causative role for HTLV in AIDS. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;However...people in southern Japan may have a greater resistance to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the T-cell suppressive effect of the virus." </i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;Davin C. Enigl &lt;enigl@aol.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, they argue _against_ even the whole class of HTLV viruses as the cause of</i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS.  That does not support your premise that they were arguing only for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;HTLV class of what we now know as several viruses with similar genome.   </i><br>
<p>
I would point out that here Gallo is not cautioning us that HTLV may have <br>
no role, as much as he is anticipating an obvious objection to the etiological <br>
role of HTLV [HTLV is endemic in southern Japan, but AIDS is not epidemic <br>
there], and arguing that HTLV STILL might be the cause ["however ...people <br>
in southern Japan may have a greater resistance to the T-cell suppressive <br>
effect of the virus."] Note the use of the word however.  <br>
