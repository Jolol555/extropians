Max Rasmussen &lt;maxmcorp@inet.uni-c.dk&gt; says:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Byterange scheme won't work in a hypermedia enviroment because the</i><br>
<i>&gt;media is so easily edited. There got to be some kind of TAG in the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt;text for any "include" system to work.</i><br>
<p>
Byte ranges work with editing if old versions remain available.<br>
That way, you refer to a range within a version.  There's an interesting<br>
technical challenge in following a byte-range link from an old version<br>
to the corresponding place(s) in a new version.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From: Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure I see the necessity of preventing someone from changing</i><br>
<i>&gt;his posted information.  If he presents a weak argument, and then</i><br>
<i>&gt;withdraws it, haven't those who disagree accomplished their purpose?</i><br>
<i>&gt;How much more is gained by continuing to throw his earlier errors in</i><br>
<i>&gt;his face?  If the goal is to approach the truth, then there should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing wrong with people evolving their publications in the face of</i><br>
<i>&gt;criticism.</i><br>
<p>
If there is a mechanism for the author to publish subsequent versions,<br>
and a way to see that the old version is superceded, and how the new<br>
version differs, then we can keep the old version *and* let the author<br>
retract/revise/ammend/clarify... it.<br>
<p>
I can't think of a please-don't-store-and-retransmit protocol that couldn't<br>
easily be gotten around by crypto and scrambling routers, even if *most*<br>
people wanted to honor such requests.  Even if you say that only the<br>
original signer of a message can retract it.  If the system is built to<br>
prevent censorship and traces by info police or spies, then (I think) it<br>
can easily be used to reveal retracted writings.  And if there's<br>
a demand for that, then (seems to me) there will be people in the business.<br>
<p>
My instinct says that a system built around the truth works better than a<br>
system built around an idealization of the truth.  In this case the truth<br>
is that things have been said in the past, *and* sometimes people misstate<br>
things or change their minds, and sometimes people *really don't want* you<br>
to read certain information.  The system should represent all of these.<br>
It would be idealization to think that everyone is trying to make the most<br>
comfortable environment for debate, that no on wants to unnecessarily<br>
embarrass anyone, that we can control information.<br>
<p>
Funny finding myself writing about "the system" meaning the overall<br>
effect that the diverse things going on on the net ought to have and<br>
be designed toward having.  I believe that design is one of the<br>
most important parts of politics...but I'm also an anarchist.  So I<br>
believe in design for *and by* distributed systems.  But still it makes<br>
sense to say "the" system "should" work a certain way.<br>
<p>
Also funny to find myself taking this somewhat fatalistic attitude toward<br>
information control.  I said before I don't like the gung-ho, "live with<br>
it" style of futurism.  But (I did also say) you gotta pick your battles.<br>

<i>&gt;Fine grain links, bidirectional links, versioning, permanent</i><br>

<p>
I forgot royalty, especially fine-grained royalty, and inline quote<br>
links.  These are all features of the original (~1981 spec) Xanadu<br>
system.<br>
