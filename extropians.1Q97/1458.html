Eric Watt Forste responded:<br>
<i>&gt;This seems to assume that internal value conflicts are not possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact, internal value conflicts are not only fairly common, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;can also be deliberately whipped up. Once you are in a state of</i><br>
<i>&gt;value conflict, then you can choose which of your values to "push</i><br>
<i>&gt;toward" to settle back out of that state of internal value conflict.</i><br>
<i>&gt;When you start rearranging your environment (physical and social,</i><br>
<i>&gt;i. e. making new friends, for instance), then you can reinforce</i><br>
<i>&gt;your own decisions about which values you want to strengthen.</i><br>
<p>
Given a value conflict, you do choose.  But I suspect you couldn't<br>
know ahead of time which you would choose.   If you knew which of your<br>
values you didn't value, and wanted to weaken, I'm not sure how you<br>
can say you value that value in the first place.  <br>
<p>
Maybe committee in fighting is a useful analogy.  Committee members<br>
might look forward to the time at which they can get rid of other<br>
members the continually fight with.  But it could well be that they<br>
are the ones dumped.  If everyone on the committee knew that someone<br>
is sure to be voted off of the committee when the vote comes up, it is<br>
hard to see how that person to be dumped can have much influence now.<br>
Crude committee voting rules might give them temporary power, but I'm<br>
not sure our minds are so crudely organized.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The way you phrase your last question ignores the possiblity of</i><br>
<i>&gt;metavalues, of multiple metavalues, of multiple *levels* of</i><br>
<i>&gt;metavalues, and of metavalue conflicts.</i><br>
<p>
Given meta-values, non-meta-values are really strategies and<br>
hueristics, to my way of thinking.  <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;This is a pretty direct challenge to some extropian thinking:</i><br>
<i>&gt;if we can't transform our own values, desires, and ideals, then in</i><br>
<i>&gt;what meaningful and interesting sense is Self-Transformation</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible? </i><br>
<p>
We can transform our abilities, perceptions, knowledge, insight,<br>
wisdom, experience, bodily form, network of associates, etc.<br>
