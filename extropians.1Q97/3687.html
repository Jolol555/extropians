<i>&gt; &gt; All such utilities are snake oil.  To rely on them is worse than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; having none at all, because they give you the illusion of security.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In my ignorance I am not convinced they don't work. Show me the proof.</i><br>
<p>
Data Recovery Systems and other companies make a good living recovering<br>
data from computers that have been in fires, floods, and accidental<br>
erasures, and they are frequently hired by law enforcement agencies to<br>
recover from intentional erasures--even sophisticated ones.  A single<br>
"bit" on a hard drive comprises thousands of flux changes, and each time<br>
it is written, the boundaries are a little different, and the intensities<br>
are a little different.  The techniques are all very well known and well<br>
reported for decades.  All you need is a reader that can produce a map<br>
of the flux intensities about 100 times finer than the read head itself,<br>
and good software will tell you what the last dozen or so written bits<br>
were at each location, and analyzing the positional offsets can tell<br>
you which bits were written at similar times.<br>
<p>
If you don't believe it, just use one of those programs, then call<br>
them up and pay them to recover it for you.  Won't be cheap, though.<br>
