<i>&gt;This is more or less true, however, what is left out is that </i><br>
<i>&gt;anarcho-syndicalism, or libertarian socialism, is not a philosophy based</i><br>
<i>&gt;on altruism but in fact on rational, enlightened self-interest.</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are in fact win-win, and lose-win situations in a socialistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;context as well as the context one might have between two capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt;businessmen who make a deal (both see themselves as "winning"...</i><br>
<i>&gt;this is considered the capitalistic "win-win" situation...</i><br>
<p>
Why is it more win-win for two capitalists to agree on something<br>
then it is for an employee to voluntarily exchange<br>
labour for wages with an employer?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;of course it is a win-lose situation when one capitalist is forcing</i><br>
<i>&gt;people at gun point in a slave-labor shop in South Korea, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;El Salvador.  In the case of a socialistic win-win situation,</i><br>
<p>
One capitalist initiating force against people tells us<br>
that a particular capitalist is in violation of all the individual<br>
rights of self-ownership and private property which are necessary<br>
for a free market.  It tells us nothing about capitalists as<br>
a category of persons, except perhaps that they can be just as evil as<br>
anyone else, which is no great surprise - but keep in mind that in doing so<br>
they are acting outside there capacity as capitalists - they are using force<br>
rather than trade.                      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;you have cases where two people agree to work on building a house.</i><br>
<i>&gt;both will eventually benefit from the warmth of the house... but</i><br>
<i>&gt;their agreement is not based on the exchange of capital, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;the fact that they both need each others labor.  One could try to</i><br>
<p>
What if one person is a carpenter who builds 90% of the house<br>
while the other persons specializes in just the plumbing?  How<br>
do we make up that difference?  The only problem with the<br>
anarcho-syndicalist win-win is that it will only work reliably<br>
if both sides can set things up so work is split perfectly<br>
even.  If capital such as money is used, the difference in<br>
labor can be made up by the less productive contributing<br>
an agreed upon sum.  But here I find something disconcerting;<br>
the very fact that anarcho-syndicalism is aimed towards this<br>
very specific way of organizing labor is cause for concern;<br>
if its is really just an affirmation of individual rights and<br>
nothing more, whose to say that in an anarcho-syndicalist<br>
society people will choose to forgo the use of capital?<br>
Why not have corporations, if they don't violate individual<br>
rights?  In other words, is anarcho-syndicalism about<br>
freeing people to pursue there own ends, or is it about<br>
people having freedom as defined by Noam Chomsky? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;sucker the other individual </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So-called Libertarian capitalism or "Anarcho-capitalism" is described as</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalism without the state. This, however, is far from comparable to</i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarian socialism or even anarchist individualism.  A capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;without the state would not do away with state regulations</i><br>
<i>&gt;of private property, because the new private state put up to protect </i><br>
<i>&gt;private property would prevent people from utilizing vast areas of</i><br>
<i>&gt;property </i><br>
<p>
Would it? Or would land find its way into the hands of people<br>
who could best use it, by voluntary exchange? <br>
 If it became as powerful interventionist as the prior state could it still<br>
be called anarcho-capitalist?  Hardly.   Besides which, anarcho- capitalists<br>
support many competing "Private protection Agencies" and base their theories<br>
on the order that would emerge from there interaction, not on replacing our<br>
current government with a some private, plutocratic, corporativist<br>
quasi-state which is the straw man you seem to be putting forth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Collectivist anarchy and Individualist anarchy vs "anarcho-" capitalism:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are two groups of Libertarians the Spontaneous</i><br>
<i>&gt;Socialists (Collectivist anarchy) and the Individualist Anarchists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is another group, the so-called anarcho-capitalists, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;they in fact are one of the current incarnations of a form</i><br>
<i>&gt;of liberalism that existed before the more common Liberalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the post-FDR years.  This type of "liberalism" bases it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;"liberal" emphasis on the fact that it opposes the State and</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Church as entities that control capital.   It does not,</i><br>
<i>&gt;however, have much to say about liberty of labor, or the rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;of individuals in the labor force, beyond that they have the "choice"</i><br>
<i>&gt;of whom to take order from, or the opportunity to become a boss</i><br>
<i>&gt;and give orders to someone else.</i><br>
<p>
Such beautiful semantics.  An order in the military has<br>
consequences such as beating or even death for not being obeyed.<br>
An order in the business world is when, as a customer, I ask<br>
for a medium ham and pineapple with extra cheese.  Or when,<br>
as a manager, I ask for that report to be on my desk by 8:00.<br>
If the report's a bit late I might not care.  But what if<br>
it was critical?  What if it is a doctor asking for a file<br>
before an operation? What if it wasn't the first time it was late?<br>
The point is that employer can not, without violating your individual<br>
rights, punish you in any other way than perhaps some verbal chastisement or<br>
by firing you.                                          <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The first group is where Rudolf Rocker, Noam Chomsky</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Gregory P. Maximoff stand. A common misconception is that their</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems are based on the illegalization of private property.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt;is not true.  anarcho-syndicalism, or libertarian socialism, is based</i><br>
<i>&gt;on working class individualists putting their own self-interests</i><br>
<i>&gt;first and _abandoning_ the system of private property that</i><br>
<i>&gt;exploits them.  The survival of such a group is not based on</i><br>
<p>
There is nothing stopping these people from setting up there<br>
alternative syndicates, communes, etc within a free and open<br>
society founded on individual rights such as anarcho-capitalists<br>
espouse.  Unless of course the "abandonment" means the looting<br>
of property belonging to people outside those who voluntarily subject<br>
themselves to such a movement.  This is what makes me<br>
suspicious of anarcho-syndicalists; are they really after<br>
a just society based on the non-initiation of force or do they just seek a<br>
free-for-all, a forced redistribution of wealth, a way of "getting even"<br>
with there alleged oppressors?(The richer,<br>
the more guilty, of course, eh Jacque?). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"expelling" win-lose meme private property people, but rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;in keeping the win-win libertarian socialist people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This group does not force itself to not see the "win-win" aspects</i><br>
<i>&gt;of capitalism: it's pretty obvious that there are some win-win</i><br>
<i>&gt;transactions, where two powerful capitalists might make a transaction</i><br>
<p>
So its only powerful capitalists that can find themselves<br>
in win-win situations? Again, is the typical purchase<br>
of retail goods by a consumer not just as much a win-win <br>
situation as between two "powerful capitalists"?<br>
<p>
You seem to falsely assume that employers/capitalists by definition or by<br>
vocation, are rich, probably drive BMW's, and are of course skimming more<br>
than they should from there workers. Further, you seem blind to the fact<br>
that corporate profits are often spread out amongst thousands of<br>
shareholders; in many cases the greater portion of the shares are owned by<br>
workers themselves.   <br>
Its amazing the type of snow job our western media has done<br>
in propogating these politically correct myths.<br>
 More "capitalists" and businessmen are losing money than making money.  In<br>
Canada at least, two out of three new businesses<br>
fail and file for bankruptcy in a year.  80% of employees work for small or<br>
intermediate size companies, and the remainder is mostly public sector - a<br>
fraction is accounted for by those "big corporations", who are downsizing<br>
anyways, where they are not artificially propped up by government.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;and each side be satisfied... however, what they recognize is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that there is ALWAYS a win-lose side to capitalism in how workers</i><br>
<i>&gt;are treated.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the worker's perspective this is obvious - the worker</i><br>
will always want to make higher wages.  But the employer<br>
could just as easily be on the losing side if a certain worker<br>
is endangering the lives of other workers, causing damage<br>
to his property, producing considerably less than other employees (while<br>
drawing the same wage), or otherwise defrauding the employer. Its a two-way<br>
street. <br>
<p>
Again, our culture seems to be saddled with this illusion that if you're<br>
doing business your necessarily making bundles of money.  The fact of the<br>
matter is that many capitalists barely survive; many thousands go out of<br>
business every year.  We always hear about the fortune-500 type corporations<br>
in the media (who themselves<br>
have been known to collapse overnight), but we never hear about the ones<br>
that are struggling to compete under massive taxations and regulation.<br>
Besides which, most of the money that a capitalist makes goes right back<br>
into the business if he has any hope of making it through the next fiscal year. <br>
The successful capitalist is typically a person who has made an<br>
initial investment, risked some capital, and has become rich over the course<br>
of many years (the "vision" thing), while the wage-earner is one who chooses<br>
a steady cash-flow at a certain level.  Different strokes for different<br>
folks.  The hard luck stories are certainly not unique to either side, and<br>
neither<br>
is the blame.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Individualist and Socialistic anarchy are not fundamentally different.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some capitalist theorists have argued that capitalism is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;individualist philosophy based on the idea that the "individual"</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalist is pitted against the "mass" of workers.  But the</i><br>
<p>
This word "capitalism" that is thrown around is incredibly <br>
anachronistic.   In a free market there is no predestination of who is or<br>
can be what -  You could be simultaneously employed at three part-time jobs<br>
and have your own little business on the side. <br>
You could go freelance and do everything by contracting out -<br>
are you a temporary employee, or a "capitalist" offering a service to<br>
another capitalist? Not surprising, the market reality is by far<br>
more complex and fluid then antiquated Marxist dogma will ever be able come<br>
to terms with.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;reality is that it is the individual worker against the</i><br>
<i>&gt;individual boss.   The model of "mass" representing the left,</i><br>
<p>
True, but having a constant conflict like that isn't very good<br>
for business.  Sometimes it can't be avoided; the question<br>
is are they going to work it out on there own for a mutually<br>
agreeable outcome or are we going to have Big Brother come<br>
in on one side or another.   So another model you can<br>
throw out is the left representing the worker - I hopefully<br>
won't have to go into the life of the average worker under<br>
any form of communism compared to the standard of living in<br>
market economies.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;something boosted by Stalinist ideology, only helped re-enforce</i><br>
<i>&gt;the illusion of "individual" on the capitalist side.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the early individualist anarchists were not in favor of capitalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;per se, they were simply opposed to mass state organizations like the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Communist Party.  Individualist-leaning philosophers like Thomas Jefferson,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Adam Smith, Lysander Spooner, Henry David Thoreau, Max Stirner and so on</i><br>
<i>&gt;all believed that workers had fundamental rights, and the right to their</i><br>
<i>&gt;fair share of labor... but they had to claim it themselves, </i><br>
through<br>
<i>&gt;their own efforts, and through acts of resistance, strikes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and civil disobedience.. not by imposing ones will on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalist individual, but by refusing to be exploited by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;capitalist individual.</i><br>
<p>
A worker should have no more or less rights than the capitalist.<br>
The labor of a worker is a commodity to be offered to other free<br>
individuals, and as such the price will be set by the market;<br>
i.e. what people are willing to pay.  Any other method of determining labour<br>
is inherently non-voluntaristic, and requires<br>
a State or State-like institution to mandate and enforce. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another name for libertarian socialists might be "Laissez-Faire </i><br>
<i>&gt;Socialists": the saying goes that if a group of libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt;workers were approached by a government official who asked them</i><br>
<i>&gt;"what can I do for you?", the answer would be "leave us alone:</i><br>
<i>&gt;labor united can solve it's own problems".  The Communist and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Socialist parties turned to electorialism and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;state as a tool to solve the working class's problems... but</i><br>
<i>&gt;libertarian and individualist anarchists historically</i><br>
<i>&gt;rejected this.</i><br>
<p>
A fair analysis. As long as labour united was through voluntary association.<br>
I can name dozens of professions here in Canada where joining a union,<br>
paying its dues, striking when ordered and parroting its ideology is mandatory.<br>
  I would still question your dividing people into hostile camps of<br>
"workers" and "capitalists" - the freer the market the more meaningless this<br>
artificial division becomes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Laissez-Faire Socialists (individualist and syndicalist anarchy)</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe people like to work hard and get paid fairly for it. Win-win...</i><br>
<p>
Would this include the capitalist that works hard for years,<br>
risking capital with no immediate pay-off or guarantee of <br>
success, and in doing so creating jobs? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(though capitalists often force themselves to refuse to see the win-win</i><br>
<i>&gt;aspect of such a situation and only see it as win-lose, thus opposing</i><br>
<i>&gt;working-class individuals who ask for nothing more than freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt;from exploitation)</i><br>
<p>
The only capitalists I can think of that would grant to themselves<br>
special priviledges above and beyond those given to other individuals are<br>
those who benefit from statist intervention<br>
in the form of protectionism, subsidies, regulations that<br>
favor there market niche, etc...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Libertarian Socialism/ anarcho-syndicalism encourages people to work and</i><br>
<i>&gt;be paid a fair wage (WIN-WIN) when they are employed.</i><br>
<p>
A fair wage according to who?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Libertarian socialism assumes people own their own bodies, unlike</i><br>
<i>&gt;"anarcho-capitalism" where the individual is "owned" by the corporation</i><br>
<i>&gt;they work for. In "anarcho-" capitalist society human behavior is </i><br>
<p>
Not true. Anarcho-capitalism is far more firmly grounded in<br>
the right to self-ownership than any anarcho-syndicalist rhetoric<br>
I've ever heard (Or seen in practice - whatever did happen<br>
to Catalonia...?).  In practice, of course, you could always raise<br>
the specter of the poor little worker being exploited by the<br>
big rich industrialist, but what is to stop the syndicate or<br>
commune, or whatever miraculously more just system of organizing<br>
labour from doing exactly the same?  Serious exploitation of the type you<br>
ascribe so readily to your view of the monolithic corporation (always rich<br>
of course) vs the individual worker (always exploited, naturally) amounts to<br>
a criminal act.  <br>
<p>
(And if your cynical about the worker getting justice, just look at some of<br>
the frivolous lawsuits where the employee recovers millions<br>
from the "deep-pockets" corporation)<br>
<p>
 Friedman's argument is primarily a utilitarian one.  He argues that with<br>
privatization and deregulation, the worker will have far<br>
more choice of who he works for, as thousands of more businesses<br>
spring up his labour will become a more and more valuable commodity, as<br>
demand increases for a finite quantity.   There will always be abuse of<br>
privilege in any organized system.  All that we can hope for is that<br>
individuals be held accountable for crimes against individuals, and not have<br>
the issue obscured by traditional third party interests - be it the State,<br>
the Corporation/syndicate, or the Union.  Legal action must be based on the<br>
facts of each individual case, and not unilaterally decided based on one<br>
dominant political ideology or another.  {Friedman follows this track even<br>
deeper, making arguments for privatizing the judicial and law-enforcement<br>
system as being the best guarantee against such abuses.  I don't no about<br>
going that far, but I'd certainly start with the depoliticization of the<br>
current judicial system}   <br>
 <br>
regulated<br>
<i>&gt;by the imposition of regulatory patents, copyright laws, and so on.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;BTW, Fascism is a form extreme capitalism. Fascism occours when small business </i><br>
<i>&gt;owners, frightened of a rising, militant and organised working class,</i><br>
<i>&gt;turn to the extreme right which uses workerist rhetoric and emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt;appeals to build a counter-revolutionary movement to stop the spread</i><br>
<i>&gt;of (libertarian) socialist ideas.</i><br>
<p>
So fascism comes from the small businessman who operates the<br>
corner store?  I find this a bit of a stretch.  <br>
Fascism is simply complete statism through the quickest means possible,<br>
whether it be socialist slogans, anti-semitism, nationalist fervor -<br>
whatever works to secure power to those seeking it.  <br>
(Granted, rich bankers supported Hitler's regime, but I've always wondered<br>
what would of happened to a banker who didn't extend a generous line of<br>
credit to Herr Hitler?)  <br>
Also it should be pointed out that capitalism really isn't<br>
an "ism" at all (it was named by its enemies) - its not a political ideology<br>
but rather an economic structure that emerges from a<br>
society based on invidual rights, private property, and voluntary<br>
transactions.<br>
