Abstract<br>
    A Solar System-wide transportation system is proposed for freight <br>
and for spacecraft propulsion. A network of accelerator/decelerator <br>
stations in various positions around the Solar System pass 'Smart <br>
Pellets' and othe<br>
r forms of matter and energy between each other, to planets and other <br>
bodies, and to spacecraft in transit. Stations at planets might be in <br>
high polar halo orbit, supported by planet-based accelerators, or in <br>
nominal HEO,<br>
 HEEO, or forced orbits. Other 'relay stations' are in Solar free or <br>
forced orbits. The positions these relay stations take up is dependent <br>
upon the particular state of development of the entire Solar System, as <br>
well as t<br>
he developmental state of the transportation network (IRTS) itself. <br>
Some examples of networks are shown, primarily between Earth, Mars, <br>
near-Earth asteroids, the main asteroid belt and the Jupiter system.<br>
    By supplying fuel on demand to a spacecraft in transit, extremely <br>
fast and short manned interplanetary transfers are possible, a matter <br>
of a few weeks or days. The specific impulse of the spacecraft's rocket <br>
engine is<br>
 not a critical factor. Three novel accelerator station designs are <br>
presented.<br>
<p>
1. Introduction<br>
    When humanity and its decendants colonize the Solar System, a need <br>
will arise for a transportation network analogous to current air, sea <br>
and land networks. Traffic between worlds, natural and artificial, <br>
implies such <br>
a system. Disassembling millions of comets and asteroids, mining and <br>
terraforming other worlds, building new worlds and shipping freight <br>
would be greatly facilitated by having 'service stations' extant to <br>
support these ac<br>
tivities [Lewis, terraforming REFS].<br>
    In this proposal, a network of 'relay stations' in various positions about the Solar System pass 'Smart Pellets' and particle, laser and maser beams between each other, to planets and other bodies, and to spacecraft i<br>
n transit. Stations at planets might be in high polar halo orbit, supported by planet-based accelerators [Bishop], or in nominal High Planet Orbit (HPO), Low Planet Orbit (LPO) or High Elliptic Planet Orbit (HEPO) [Bishop<br>
<i>]. Other relay stations are in Solar free or forced orbit. The positions these stations take up is dependent upon the particular state of development of the entire Solar System, as well as the developmental state of the t</i><br>
ransportation system (IRTS) itself.<br>
    By supplying propellant or fuel on demand to a spacecraft in transit, extremely fast and short manned interplanetary transfers are possible, a matter of a few weeks or days. <br>

1.1  Background<br>
   The remote support of  interstellar spacecraft via pellet streams <br>
has been studied since the 1980's [Singer], and independently by this <br>
author [Bishop, 1982]. A later concept, the "Space Fountain" [REF], <br>
uses a circula<br>
ting pellet stream on a planetary surface to support an installation in <br>
halo orbit, as well as its own launching apparatus. The "South Pole <br>
Accelerator" [Bishop, 1981] was proposed as a method of shipping <br>
material from Ea<br>
rth to the Moon and to high orbit without having to support an <br>
intermediate halo installation. An accelerator in HEEO supplied by the <br>
South Pole Accelerator was studied as a means of supplying an <br>
interplanetary spacecraft<br>
 [Bishop, 1982]. Coilguns, or "Mass Drivers" have been studied in some <br>
detail as a method of shipping material from the Lunar surface to L5 <br>
and other points [O'Neill]. Laser and maser beams are proposed for <br>
remote heating<br>
 of rocket propellant, and for pushing lightsails [Kantrowitz, Forward, <br>
Landis]. The "Spaceport" concept [Kingsbury] is an Earth orbit facility <br>
with some similarities to an IRTS planetary station. Neutral particle <br>
beams, <br>
suitably ionized near the target spacecraft, are proposed to react with <br>
magnetic sails [Nordley, Andrews].<br>
    All of these concepts share the central ideas of separating power <br>
generation from spacecraft propulsion, and supplying the ship or colony <br>
from a large 'stationary' facility.<br>
