Yes, I have wondered often what would happen if one cloned Da Vinci, or some<br>
other genius. Imagine his mind in todays technology?( Boggle) <br>
Can we safely say that genius is not caused by mechanistic factors at all?<br>
When someone says this or that characteristic is "not genetic"- it previously<br>
meant: not passed down through heredity. Re cloning - this statement seems to<br>
be made  in a different light. <br>
It raises, for me, the troubling and unsatisfactory definition of cognition<br>
as "programs" running on a "wetware"- which I do not subscribe to. If our<br>
brains are cloned, will they "think" in similar ways, will they hold same<br>
attributes and "talents"?<br>
If I am predisposed towards being good at say, math - or the arts, will my<br>
clone also find these things easy? ( of course environment will affect these<br>
things to a degree, but how can we know to- *what* -degree?)<br>
 Once upon a time I remember some feeble attempts on the list towards<br>
redirecting a gender polarized debate on genius back to *definitions of<br>
genius*.<br>
If genius, or at least extremely high intelligence, is not genetic, what<br>
combinations of factors will most nurture it? And can it be part of our<br>
physical brain, or is it purely "programmed" in after birth?<br>
With one of the main Extropian goals being improved intelligence, it is a<br>
thread i would welcome.<br>
