Why should we be pessimistic about these results?<br>
<p>
Yes, the United States has been the exception - it has more closely <br>
approximated a free-market system than any other nation.  But as more <br>
nations shed the shackles of socialism and mercantilism, as seems to <br>
be the trend, shouldn't they too begin to approach the capital <br>
appreciation rates experienced in the U.S.?<br>
<p>
I would think the real question would be: as more nations achieve <br>
freer market mechanisms is the more level playing field and greater <br>
global competition going to drag everyone down or up?<br>

&lt;SNIP&gt;<br>
     By putting together a variety of<br>
     sources, we collected a database of capital appreciation<br>
     indexes for 39 markets with histories going as far back as<br>
     the 1920s. Our results are striking. We find that the United<br>
     States has by far the highest uninterrupted real rate of<br>
     appreciation of all countries, at about 5 percent annually.<br>
     For other countries, the median real appreciation rate is<br>
     about 1.5 percent. The high return premium obtained for U.S.<br>
     equities therefore appears to be the exception rather than<br>
     the rule. &lt;SNIP&gt;<br>
