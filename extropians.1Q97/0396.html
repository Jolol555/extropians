NOTE: I hope long time readers of this list will forgive me for fighting the      <br>
      same old battle that has been fought so often in the past, it seems to       <br>
      be necessary from time to time, but you will probably not find much new      <br>
      in this post and might want to skip it.<br>

Then perhaps you should dig a little deeper than the surface face of a thing. <br>
It's not like we don't have an example of Anarchy working beautifully, just <br>
look at the Internet.<br>

<i>                &gt;powerful.</i><br>
                     <br>
<p>
Yes, but how fast my memes spread is a function of how infectious they are, <br>
not how true they are. Memes that are false can spread very rapidly, even if <br>
they're harmful, look at the meme that if die in battle trying to expand the <br>
one true religion I will go straight to heaven. However, let's forget about <br>
all that and assume my meme is as good as you could expect it to be and I am<br>
eloquent  enough to convince others of its value. All I have done is <br>
influenced them to  vote for one politician and his grab bag of promises over <br>
another.<br>
<p>
Even if we make the ridiculous assumption that all politicians are honest and <br>
have boiling water IQ's they could never do as good a job as the free market, <br>
because they are lacking a vital ingredient, price information. The true <br>
price of an object is determined by an enormous number of variables and is <br>
much too complicated to be calculated from first principles, but the market <br>
will tell you what the price should be, no trouble at all. <br>
                                 <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;your conclusion that the people will then revolt at some                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;point is unsupported. </i><br>
                      <br>
<p>
I don't expect an armed revolt against modern democratic governments, nothing <br>
as dramatic as that, rather the black market will keep getting stronger and <br>
governments weaker until they become irrelevant. Personally I think this is a <br>
good thing, but In the long run discussing the flaws or merits of it is <br>
academic, I don't think we have a choice. Like it or not a change to <br>
Anarcho-capitalism is inevitable . Not because somebody's rhetoric convinces <br>
people of it's benefits, and certainly not because politicians change the law, <br>
but because of technology. Modern communication, cryptography and untraceable<br>
digital cash will make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes. <br>
<p>
My confidence comes from the power of exponential growth. In general, if I <br>
increase the complexity of my encryption algorithm so that it takes me twice  <br>
as long to encrypt it, I have made it not twice, but billions of times more <br>
difficult for an attacker to break it. The government has access to more <br>
powerful computers than I do, but not that much more powerful. There is just  <br>
no getting around it, recent developments in mathematics and communication  <br>
have tipped the balance away from the tax collector and in favor of the  <br>
tax evader.<br>
<p>
Governments will undoubtedly draft many new laws to try to protect themselves <br>
but making rules is easy, enforcing them is not. I admit that if government <br>
gets to pick what form of digital cash  and encryption we must use then the <br>
Crypto Singularity  will not happen, but they've already tried to do something <br>
like that with the Clipper chip and the suppression of PGP and both have <br>
flopped big time. Short of dismantling the internet and confiscating all home <br>
computers it's impossible to dictate what form of encryption or digital cash <br>
you must use. When people are given a choice between one form of cash you pay<br>
tax on and another that you don't it won't take them long to make a decision.<br>
<p>
Regardless of the rules, you can't collect the tax if you can't find the <br>
money. Even the traditional standby of "tax by inflation"  would not work as <br>
people would just switch to a competing currency  (untraceable of course) that <br>
suited their needs better.   The tribute that could still be extracted, like<br>
property taxes and  building permits, would have to be increased to <br>
astronomic levels and  collected with a heavy hand, a tax revolt will follow. Without money  government will grind to a<br>
halt. <br>
                              <br>
<p>
<i>                       &gt;Who would enforce it? The government? </i><br>
                         <br>
<p>
It's not clear to me what "it" refers to, I think you mean law and order and <br>
justice. Well, no system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but <br>
you'd have the greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism.  In a <br>
dictatorship one man's whim can lead to hell on earth,  I don't see how 40 <br>
million Germans could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic <br>
world. Things aren't much better in a  Democracy,  51% can decide to kill the <br>
other 49% , nothing even close to that is  possible in Anarchy, even <br>
theoretically.    <br>
       <br>
Consider what would happen if law and law enforcement were driven by market <br>
forces. In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the <br>
desire to kill a stranger, even a Jewish stranger. Jews would be willing to <br>
pay as much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to <br>
be killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond <br>
2%. As a result the PPA (private protection agency) protecting Jews would be <br>
much  stronger than the  one that wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things <br>
that are REALLY important to you ( like not getting  killed) you have much <br>
more influence than just one man one vote.  <br>
             <br>
And it doesn't mean justice only for the rich. If a rich man's PPA makes <br>
unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice,  I insist on my mother <br>
being the judge if I get into trouble)  it's  going to need one hell of a lot <br>
of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is expensive because of the <br>
hardware needed and because of the very high wages it will need to pay its<br>
employees for an extremely  dangerous job. To pay for all this they will need <br>
to charge their clients enormous fees severely limiting their customer base <br>
and that  means even higher charges. They could never get the upper hand <br>
because the  common man's PPA would be able to outspend a PPA that had  <br>
outrageous demands and was  just for the super rich. A yacht cost a lot more <br>
than a car yet the Ford motor Company is far richer than all the yacht <br>
builders on the planet combined. <br>
<p>
It won't be perfect, there will still be brutality, but you have to ask <br>
yourself, brutal compared to what? States? Governments, those paragons of <br>
charity and morality, those defenders of the weak and powerless, the source <br>
of all virtue, have butchered hundreds of millions of people this century <br>
alone, often their own citizens. We'd have to work very hard to break that <br>
record. <br>
                                   <br>
Please don't misunderstand me, as I said Capitalism is NOT the best <br>
conceivable system, only the best possible one.  Without the slightest doubt <br>
the best system is one in which everybody does  exactly what I want them to <br>
do. For some reason I have had limited success  convincing others of the <br>
wisdom of this view. <br>
  <br>
The next best system would  be a king who never made mistakes and who was  <br>
100 times smarter than Einstein and 100 times kinder that Mother Theresa. <br>
The trouble is, although every tinhorn dictator or politician on the planet <br>
claims to have these wonderful attributes, none have proven to actually <br>
posses them. Despite  thousands of examples over hundreds of years of venal, <br>
self serving, stupid, behavior by those who want to rule us, people still <br>
expect politicians to know what the right thing is and then to actually do it. <br>
They are ALWAYS disappointed and ALWAYS will be, yet they still believe that <br>
if we just have one more election and get the right people in office <br>
everything will be peachy.<br>
<p>
Free market ideas are often unpopular among opinionated people (and I'm more <br>
opinionated than most) because in their hart of harts they are certain <br>
(and being certain is NOT the same as being correct) that they know exactly <br>
how society should be run. Capitalism will not guarantee a society that you <br>
or I would consider perfect, so it is rejected in favor of a mythical perfect <br>
system.  If an alternative to free markets is used then other strong willed  <br>
people will disagree with your view of perfection and the result is conflict <br>
and even war.  A classic example of perfection being the enemy of the good.<br>
<p>
The central problem is that any interference with the Free Market means there  <br>
must be a judge, but who judges the judge? Who judges the judge of the judge?  <br>
Who judges...<br>
<p>
                     <br>
<i>                    &gt;Human society is a  meme pool. </i><br>
<p>
                  <br>
Yes, but remember there is FAR more to a society than government.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>                    &gt;If you dissolve all the existing structures </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Who would want to do that?! It would mean going back to the stone age,  <br>
or worse.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                    &gt;even if it were possible </i><br>
                 <br>
<p>
Only by killing every human on earth.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>                    &gt;new structures would soon arise and self-organize.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly my point, new and better structures will arise to perform the things  <br>
government does now.<br>
                     <br>
