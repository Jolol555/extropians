A would think it was A, B would think it was A, both would be correct.<br>

You walk into a matter duplicating chamber, there is a blinding flash of <br>
light, when your eyes clear there is a man who looks just like you standing <br>
to your right. I have 3 questions.<br>
      <br>
1) How could you determine if you were the "original" (whatever that means) <br>
   or the "copy"?  <br>
2) Why should you even care?  <br>
3) If you somehow found out that you were the copy, what if anything would <br>
   you do?<br>
         <br>

<i>        &gt;They are exposed to different memes. They evolve diferently.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Certainly, as time went on the two would start to diverge.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;One difference, no matter how small, means they are not the same.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Don't drink a cup of coffee, it will change you far more than Quantum  <br>
Uncertainty ever will.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Different atoms = different people.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then you are quite literally a different person than you were one year ago <br>
because your atoms are different, it doesn't matter. Atoms have no  <br>
distinguishing marks, no scratches on them to tell them apart. In Science   <br>
you can exchange one atom of Hydrogen with another  one and the system does <br>
not change at all. If atoms themselves have no individuality I don't see how<br>
on earth they could give this interesting property to us.<br>
