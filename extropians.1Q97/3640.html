Gregory Houston:<br>
<i>&gt;The artist is the emotive aspect underlying and</i><br>
<i>&gt;outwardly representing any society or institituition. The artist</i><br>
<i>&gt;amplifies and accentuates the qualities of an organization while</i><br>
<i>&gt;revealing that organization's affectual ramifications. The statement of</i><br>
<i>&gt;an artist is first and formost a statement of condition, a state of</i><br>
<i>&gt;mind, a status of society. It is the testemonial of an organization's</i><br>
<i>&gt;member. </i><br>
<p>
Your above statement represents only one definition of art, and it is <br>
one that I as an artist do not subscribe to.  As an artist I am fully <br>
responsible for my own visions, and they do not necessarily stem from <br>
the particular society that I live in, and to accept those types of <br>
boundaries would prevent me from exploring the transhumanist ideas I <br>
am interested in.  Moreover, I do not accept transhumanism itself as <br>
a criterion for what I write--rather, my transhumanist orientation <br>
frees my mind from barriers imposed by other ideologies.  To that <br>
extent, I consider myself a writer who happens to be transhumanist.<br>
<p>
Natasha's comments in her post have highlighted my own discomfort <br>
with signing onto any art movement.  If she chooses to utilize her <br>
artistic skills to further Extropianism, that is certainly a worthy <br>
goal and one that I support.  But I could never accept such a close <br>
association between my personal philosophy and my art.  My own <br>
family history, one marked by escape from various repressive <br>
homelands, serves as a constant reminder to be vigilent, even against <br>
my own internal tendencies to impose an ideology.  <br>
<p>
I know that my comments are not as erudite as Sarah's or George's, <br>
but mine come from the center of passion that produces the actual art <br>
in question, and I would hope that they would be considered in that <br>
light.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
