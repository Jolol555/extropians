Gregory Houston: &lt;I have no desire to attain truth.&gt;<br>
<p>
RJ: Well, chalk up yet one more twentieth-century vote in favor of lies and<br>
propaganda.<br>
<p>
Gregory Houston wrote 2/13/97: &lt;You are extremely talented in<br>
decontextualization. Bravo.&gt;<br>
<p>
Perhaps so, but I didn't show it above.  Far from engaging in<br>
decontextualization, I simply repeated the sum total context of your post,<br>
namely, "I have no desire to attain truth."  Once you have said this,<br>
everything else you post must be viewed as untruthful, hence, contextless. <br>
Context itself has no meaning absent truth.<br>
<p>
&lt;If science cannot prove something as true or false, then science cannot<br>
attain truth.&gt;<br>
<p>
Look at science more broadly as technicism, see that there is no boundary<br>
between science and technology, and you will see that technology verifies<br>
the theoretical statements of science in actuality.<br>
<p>
&lt;Your desire for truth is more of a religious fixation than any I have<br>
displayed.&gt;<br>
<p>
Why bother asserting this, since, according to you, you have nothing<br>
truthful to say?  Why bother saying anything at all?  To me, your vigorous<br>
support of lying indicates quite a strong religious bent, you worship the<br>
Father of Lies, ol' Beelzebubba.<br>
<p>
&lt;Science is fundamentally driven by need and desire. We need to be able to<br>
predict such and such to survive. I desire to predict such and such in<br>
order to survive forever.&gt;<br>
<p>
There is a rich hoard of historical literature, much of it<br>
autobiographical, about scientists (and natural philosophers) being<br>
motivated by the pure search for knowledge itself, completely unconnected<br>
to any animal desire for survival.  Perhaps they all were lying about this.<br>
<p>
&lt;Science is a tool of need and desire. It is an emotive tool, yet it denies<br>
the emotions.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is clearly untrue, scientists undeniably squeal like stuck pigs when<br>
their government funding is cut.  They get quite emotional about it.<br>
<p>
&lt;We cannot even prove that absolute truth exists.&gt;<br>
<p>
Who is this "we"?  Perhaps you need to broaden your circle of associates.<br>
<p>
&lt;It would not even matter if in some freakish sense that I myself did not<br>
"truely" exist.&gt;<br>
<p>
This appears to be an agreeable statement.<br>
<p>
&lt;Real or illusion, the truth does not matter.&gt;<br>
<p>
Really?<br>
<p>
&lt;Today people say, "God is dead". Tomorrow people will realize that truth<br>
died with him.&gt;<br>
<p>
I think you mean that a hundred years ago people said "God is dead."  Then<br>
came the filthy French compost-modernists who pretended that truth died<br>
with him.  Then came the inability for my children to go out in my<br>
neighborhood without constant adult supervision for fear of the barbaric<br>
perverts who grew up inculcated with your religious beliefs.<br>
<p>
&lt;Truth is truth, its either true or false.&gt;<br>
<p>
It's true that I cannot parse this sentence.<br>
<p>
&lt;I think Descartes proved once and for all with his evil genius theory<br>
that we can never attain truth, because we can never prove it.&gt;<br>
<p>
He did?  He was French, n'est pas?  Well, my microwave oven proved to me<br>
the truth of Maxwell's theories.  I realize Descartes did not have the<br>
benefit of microwave ovens.<br>
<p>
&lt;How can you be absolutely honest with others when you cannot even by<br>
honest with yourself. You do not know yourself well enough. You are not<br>
aware enough of whats going on subconsciously to imagine that you are being<br>
truthful.&gt;<br>
<p>
Do not make the mistake that because you are confused, that others are<br>
similarly confused.  This is an invalid deduction.  Certainly, since you<br>
have once again repeated that "I have no desire to attain truth," we can<br>
all see that you have no intention whatsoever of being honest, even if you<br>
weren't internally confused.<br>
<p>
&lt;The concept of "truth" is not even compatible with Pancritical<br>
Rationalism.&gt;<br>
<p>
This topic came up on the list in March 1994.  At that time, I was<br>
concerned, based on the positions that some individuals were taking on PCR,<br>
that your statement above was quite probably true.  However, this point,<br>
for me, was cleared up by Max More when he wrote:<br>
<p>
"PCR *is* grounded in subjective purposes in the sense that, if my one of<br>
my goals was not to be as rational as possible, I would not be interested<br>
in PCR.  Even if PCR can be successfully defended against all criticisms,<br>
it will never appeal to persons who care nothing for consistency, truth, or<br>
reason.  In this sense, PCR is grounded in one's values and so is not "smug<br>
nihilism".  Note that this is not to say that PCR is *justified* in terms<br>
of  one's values; it means only that one's acceptance of PCR is explained<br>
by one's  valuing rationality in combination with believing that PCR, so<br>
far, provides the  best, most consistent, characterization of what it means<br>
to be a rationalist."<br>
<p>
To which I replied: <br>
<p>
"I support this unreservedly.  I am glad to see it made explicitly because<br>
only by making it explicit does PCR avoid being merely smug nihilism."<br>
<p>
Recently, I ran across an analysis of this same point by the philosopher<br>
Etienne Gilson who concluded (rightly) that: "You must either begin as a<br>
realist with being, in which case you will have a knowledge of being, or<br>
begin as a critical idealist with knowledge, in which case you will never<br>
come in contact with being."<br>
<p>
What Gilson refers to as the "critical idealist" I was referring to as the<br>
"smug nihilist."  Being and truth are, of course, different aspects of the<br>
same ontological primitive.  So really, Max and myself are saying the same<br>
thing, that unless you begin with a care for truth, you will never have<br>
knowledge.  You cannot begin with knowledge itself and get anywhere at all,<br>
you must begin with caring for truth.<br>
