<i>&gt; I was struck by this following passage from Albert Einstein which </i><br>
<i>&gt; seems somewhat relevant both to Eliezer's Algernon's Law idea and to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the recent debate about whether we already have all the fundamental </i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts of science down and the rest is *just engineering*.</i><br>
<p>
Sigh.  While I hate to slap down any post that cites my own work, duty<br>
calls and I must follow.<br>
<p>
Just the headers in this post are bad enough:  "PHIL/PSYCH" and<br>
"Algernon's Law" do not go together.  Algernon's Law is for "NEURO",<br>
"COG" and "&gt;H" posts only; even "PSYCH" or "AI" are iffy; "PHIL" is<br>
anathema.<br>
<p>
Algernon's Law doesn't refer to just any tradeoff made anywhere. <br>
Algernon's Law refers only to an evolutionarily predesigned cognitive<br>
mechanism altered by a single mutation and/or external influence, and<br>
deals with the tradeoffs that then occur, stating, essentially, that the<br>
result will be a net evolutionary disadvantage in the ancestral<br>
environment "unless otherwise specified".  TANSTAFFL, in a phrase.<br>
<p>
This gradual broadening seems to occur within a lot of memes; the<br>
"extropy" meme (not "extropy meme") is a fine example.  "Everything good<br>
in the world" seems to sum up many definitions; I've even seen it used<br>
completely inappropriately in thermodynamic discussions, and somewhat<br>
less inappropriately - but still wrongly - in discussions of evolution. <br>
"Extropian" refers to a bunch of people, more rocket scientists than<br>
cognitive scientists, who want to take over the Universe, improve their<br>
bodies, and *occasionally* you will run into an Extropian who wants to<br>
improve their minds.<br>
<p>
"Extropian" thus does not refer to Eliezer, who doesn't give a damn<br>
about a conglomeration of stars that could be simulated on his Power Mac<br>
with a couple of thousand lines of code, and prefers to explore the far<br>
more complex Universe inside the brain.  This can lead to occasional<br>
conflicts; I hight the recent "Singularity-worship" fiasco where both<br>
sides thought the other was wasting time.<br>
<p>
My timeline looked like this:<br>
Cognitive Science -&gt; Singularity -&gt; Universe Domination<br>
<p>
Your timeline looked like this:<br>
Nanotechnology -&gt; Universe Domination<br>
<p>
And your image of my timeline looked like this:<br>
Singularity -&gt; Universe Domination<br>
<p>
The result was that you accused me of "lying back and waiting for the<br>
Singularity to take care of everything."  What I was actually trying to<br>
say was:  "Who the hell cares about what you'll do after you're<br>
uploaded; you can figure that out *after* you're uploaded; now can we<br>
get back to discussing neural plasticity so we can get to the<br>
Singularity and be done with it?"<br>
<p>
"Algernon's Law" was created to be a technical term.  It was presented<br>
on a 21-page Web file full of cognitive science, albeit popularized<br>
cognitive science.  It's a technical term and I intend to keep it that<br>
way, because I've yet to see any good come from broadening any term but<br>
"human".<br>
<p>
Einstein only starting to think about space and time as an adult is not<br>
an instance of Algernon's Law.  If Einstein were dyslexic, that would be<br>
fascinating.  If you demonstrated that children who don't visualize<br>
about "space and time" have an easier time visualizing "space-time" when<br>
they get older - and note that I say *visualize*, as in represent via a<br>
basic cognitive module, and not *think about* - then that might fall<br>
under the Algernonic aegis.  Starting over fresh isn't even faintly<br>
Algernonic unless you're talking about a cognitive module that keeps<br>
getting wiped, or something similar.<br>
