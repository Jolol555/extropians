Perhaps the most important name on Mars is THARSIS, a "continent" <br>
on which sit most (Olympus, Ascraeus, Pavonis, Arsia) of the<br>
great volcani.  It's also one of the few classical names whose <br>
origin is not obvious to me.<br>
<p>
I looked for THARSIS in all my dictionaries.  Nothing.<br>
I looked in the index to Bullfinch's Mythology.  Nothing, <br>
to my utter lack of amazement.<br>
<p>
My big picture-book _The surface of Mars_ cites an article in _Icarus_:<br>
"The origins of martian nomenclature".  I went to the library.<br>
No _Icarus_.<br>
<p>
At a bookstore, I spent some moments slobbering over NASA's new<br>
atlas of the planets.  In the back is a list of names, with brief<br>
notes on their sources.  THARSIS, it says, means Tartessos in Spain.<br>
<p>
Home to the Oxford Classical Dictionary:<br>
	TARTESSUS, a region of south Spain, round the middle and lower<br>
	Baetis (Guadalquivir).  The name was also given to the river<br>
	and to a town at its mouth.  Probably visited by the Minoans,<br>
	it was temporarily occupied by the Phoenicians.  C. 650 BC<br>
	the Samian Colaeus was driven there; c. 600 Phocaeans came,<br>
	making friends with the Tartessian ruler.  The trade of<br>
	Tartessus with Phoenicians and Carthaginians and (in tin)<br>
	with Brittany and south-west Britain made it proverbially<br>
	wealthy.  C. 500 the town was probably destroyed by the<br>
	Carthaginians.  Geographic writers confused it with Gades.<br>
	Later poets used Tartessus of all Spain or all west Europe.<br>
	Tartessus was probably the Biblical Tarshish.<br>
<p>
Aha!  And THARSIS must be the Greek rendering of TARSHISH.<br>
Imagine my relief.<br>
<p>
--The funniest names on Mars are <br>
"Hellespontus Montes" and "Nereidum Montes".<br>
