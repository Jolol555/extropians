Thomas Edison to the contrary.  I could equally say that being a genius<br>
requires a will to publicity, a<br>
 willingness to expose oneself to the media, or a publishable personal<br>
 quirk (Hawking's illness) since many famous geniuses possessed these<br>
 qualities... &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
This is what i was getting at with my dictionary definitions:<br>
<p>
1. It is an *inate* talent or specifically strong intelligence in a given<br>
area(or areas)<br>
2. It requires a product, or at least an outlet of expression to be made<br>
manifest<br>
3. It must be recognized *within a given society, time or place* as a<br>
valuable contribution to something.<br>
4. It must be actualized with diligent hard work, perservence and drive to<br>
achieve it's zenith.<br>
