So you admit that they are doing well with the info they have<br>
immediately available, but that they are non-Bayesian regarding the<br>
amount of research they do?  "Easy to research" is relative to your<br>
education level, and its not at all clear to me that most people would<br>
be well-advised to go do more research on questions like this.<br>
