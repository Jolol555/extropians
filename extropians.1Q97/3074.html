Nadia:<br>
<i>&gt;The laziness you speak of is rarely confronted in this forum &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I thank Nadia for her comments, and would like to add that I am more <br>
willing to pin the label of 'laziness' onto artists themselves rather <br>
than those who have not yet begun an artistic exploration, partly <br>
because I perceive an underlying fear of art (a mostly taught fear) <br>
that creates barriers that the individual must decide to surmount.<br>
<p>
But the artists themselves have no such excuse, and I am royally <br>
tired of reading poetry that says nothing, of looking at sculpture <br>
that has been thrown together, paintings that blend into the wall, <br>
artists who are mostly concerned with who comes to their parties.  <br>
When a few brave literary editors decided to award a major poetry <br>
prize to an unpublished young black man, you would have thought from <br>
the ensuing uproar that they had threatened civilization itself.  <br>
<p>
And yet that event jolted me into a stronger realization that the <br>
only way to overcome this inertia is to take the responsibility for <br>
it on a personal level.  If those editors felt the need to track down <br>
someone in the Black Mountains of North Carolina to find writing that <br>
Spoke, that to me was an indication that my own personal <br>
disillusionment with the literary mill was no longer a sufficient <br>
excuse, because I could have done the same in my own editorship.  And <br>
this may be my own take on the transhumanist art movement--it doesn't <br>
matter how much talent one possesses in any particular type of art, the <br>
important aspect is to utilize those skills to communicate to others <br>
and to encourage others to do the same.  <br>
<p>
And I, for one, look forward to complete the dreary graduate school <br>
papers so that I may get on with some transhumanist writing projects. <br>
 Stay tuned!<br>
<p>
