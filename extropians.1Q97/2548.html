I'm not so sure. I have noticed that I can do certain things, for example<br>
play a very fast game of table tennis, and "loose consciousness".I mean<br>
that the normal process of internal analysis of my thinking, my<br>
"metacognition", is temporalily turned off. It is almost like my ego<br>
disappears. I think this doesen't just apply to sports either. I think the<br>
ego can be temporarily suspended during the intense thought required to<br>
solve a complex mathematical problem, for example. It may even be<br>
beneficial to do so in these circumstances. I am still just as<br>
intelligent, or maybe even more intelligent than I would be with my ego in<br>
full swing.<br>
I think consciousness has a lot to do with memory. For instance, if an AI<br>
machine was designed that had the ability to store as memories the<br>
consequences of it's actions, and form patterns and associations from<br>
those memories, then it might start to develop a consciousness. In other<br>
words, it would be able to develop a clear distinction between itself and<br>
the outside world, which is really the definition of consciousness, or<br>
ego. <br>
Remember that we all start out as id, and that our ego comes along when we<br>
can remember enough of our actions and consequences to form coherent<br>
patterns from them.<br>
