I can see why it's disturbing, but I can also understand the point of view.<br>
 Sometimes explaining things to the extreme, can initially take the wonder<br>
away.  Sometimes it's better to just appreciate the beauty.  I don't need<br>
to, for instance, initially understand the chemical composition of the<br>
paints used in a piece of art. I want to appreciate the *art*.  Later on I<br>
might be interested in the chemistry....  <br>
<p>
And a rainbow, which is beautiful and frequently evoke a sense of wonder,<br>
can be explained later...but explaining it in the moment can trivialize the<br>
experience, unless you can explain it in such a way that evokes more wonder<br>
at the complexity of the process that created such a beautiful thing.  That<br>
would require some skill, but it could be done for a 5th or 6th grader.<br>
<p>
I remember the last time I saw a Rainbow.....It was a triple...awesome.<br>
And though I understand why they occur, I really didn't want to think about<br>
that when I saw them, I just wanted to enjoy them.<br>
