        Some recents posts by J. de Lyser sparked some ideas into my head.<br>
First of all, it seems that the variety of predators of pre-humans was less<br>
than it is now.  I assume that the predators had relatively lesser<br>
intelligence than the pre-human.  John Clark pointed out that the<br>
pre-human's defensive capabilities were pretty pathetic...though it depends<br>
on what types of predators the pre-human was up against.  If there were<br>
smilodons about, perhaps the pre-human could jump into a tree...pending that<br>
the smilodon wouldn't follow.  But since I'm not sure about the type of<br>
predators around that era, I'll go on to the crux of my post.<br>
<p>
        Though instincts vary from animal to animal, one homogenous instinct<br>
throughout the animal kingdom is one of fear: animals fear what is going to<br>
eat them, maim them, attack them etc.  The animal in question usually<br>
combats this by running away etc.  For example, a certain specie of lizard<br>
has virtually no defense to predators, however, once the predator<br>
approaches, the lizard flaps its loose skin back, opens its mouth, and runs<br>
on its two hind legs.  Needless to say, the predator usually backs off.<br>
This pattern repeats itself with pufferfish, which fill themselves full of<br>
air, giving the appearance of an elongated, spiny, unedible fish.  It<br>
usually works.  Throughout the history of nature, animals seem to have<br>
improvised to save themselves from being easy prey.<br>
<p>
        Consider this scenario.  The pre-human was quite easy prey for many<br>
predatory carnivores (whatever types they may have been).  We already know<br>
that the pre-human had very little natural defense, so perhaps it<br>
improvised.  It is very possible that, when threatened, the pre-human reared<br>
itself, stood on its back legs, and gave the predator the appearance of it<br>
being much larger than it actually was...like a modern-day bear.  This may<br>
have deterred many a predator.  The constant need for rearing itself for<br>
protection would have required strength within the pre-human's thighs and<br>
spine.  It could have become neccesary to be bipedal.  From there, the usual<br>
predators weren't so willing to attack a pre-human.  By the time equivalent<br>
predators came to be, the newly bipedal pre-human began to develop a larger<br>
mind, hands, and posable thumbs.  Eventually they could create tools to kill<br>
the animals, and the 'easy prey' suddenly became the predator.  <br>
<p>
        This is just a theory, so please poke holes in it.  Is it<br>
historically plausible?  <br>
