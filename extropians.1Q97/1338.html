<i>         &gt;John:        </i><br>
<i>         &gt;Von Neumann was a very great mathematician, I don't think the man         </i><br>
<i>         &gt;was capable of making a mathematical blunder even if he wanted to,        </i><br>
<i>         &gt;however Von Neumann was not a great physicists, his mistake was</i><br>
<i>         &gt;physical not mathematical.</i><br>
<p>
<i>         &gt;Omega:        </i><br>
<i>         &gt;Sorry, his blunder was mathematical not physical.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
First of all I want to make it clear that I'm not defending Von Neumann's  <br>
proof, I'll grant you that it's wrong, I'll even grant you it's silly, but <br>
only because the axioms he used were silly. I quote from "The Cosmic Code" <br>
by the late great Heinz R Pagels page 166:<br>
<p>
 "Von Neumann's proof was logically flawless, but as Bell first pointed out, <br>
 one of the assumptions that went into Von Neumann's proof did not apply to <br>
 quantum theory and therefore the proof was irrelevant."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>         &gt;Omega:         </i><br>
<i>         &gt;Specifically he applied the average of a set to the individual         </i><br>
<i>         &gt;members of that set when doing his mathematical proof.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly, he thought it was physically obvious that because a quantum system <br>
on average obeys commutative rules then each individual part of it must too. <br>
There would be nothing illogical about a world that worked that way, it just  <br>
doesn't happen to be the physical world we live in. As I said, Von Neumann  <br>
was a great Mathematician but not a great Physicists. I quote from <br>
"Quantum Reality" by Nick Herbert page 50:<br>
<p>
 "Von Neumann and his colleagues had shown that any scheme in which ordinary <br>
 objects combined "in reasonable ways" could not reproduce the results of <br>
 quantum theory. Bell showed that Von Neumann's notion of "reasonable ways"  <br>
 was unnecessarily restrictive. In particular, Von Neumann would not have<br>
 considered "reasonable" electrons which could adjust their attributes via an <br>
 invisible field that can sense the configuration of the measuring device. <br>
 Bohm's model, which is based on such context-adaptable electrons is not <br>
 "reasonable", hence it evades Von Neumann's proof. The fact that thirty <br>
 years passed before this loophole was discovered is a measure both of the <br>
 authority of Von Neumann and the leisurely pace of quantum reality research".<br>
<p>
None of this has anything to do with Von Neumann's lack of mathematical <br>
ability, it has to do with his lack of physical intuition concerning what is <br>
physically reasonable and what is not.<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The short definition of free will is: "The ability or discretion to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;choose; free choice" [The American Heritage dictionary 3rd edition].</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Yeah, and if you look up free choice in the same dictionary I am sure you  <br>
will find something like, the act of making a decision based on free will,  <br>
and round and round we go. I don't think you will find much insight in this  <br>
matter by reading the dictionary, most Lexicographers are not great <br>
Philosophers. <br>
<p>
I gave you my definition, it's precise and as good as any I've seen, I'll <br>
give it again: A being has free will if and only if it can not predict what <br>
it will do next.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I think there's a big jump when going from 'feeling that we have         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;free will' to 'actually having free will'.</i><br>
 <br>
<p>
Not a big jump at all, not even a hop if you use my definition, and that's  <br>
the only one I have ever found useful.<br>
              <br>
<i>        &gt;John:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;I don't think the question of determinism has much to do with       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;free will. He [Turing] proved that no computer program (and I think         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that's what we are) can predict what it will do next, that is, if it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;will ever stop. The easiest, indeed the only way to know what a     </i><br>
<i>        &gt;computer program will do is to run it and see, we figure out what we         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;are going to do when we actually do it. This would be true         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;regardless of whether the Universe is deterministic or not.                 </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Omega:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;This is misleading in the extreme. Free will has everything to do       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;with the absense of determinism         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why? Everything, absolutely everything, happens because of cause and effect <br>
OR it does not happen because of cause and effect, and if it does not then it <br>
is by definition random. From your last post I thought we agreed on this.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;To take the inverse of this and define free will as the absence of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;predictability is to gratutitously redefine the meaning of the term         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;"free will" itself</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Forget about redefining it, just define it so I can have some idea about what <br>
we're talking about here, and please, no circular dictionary definitions. <br>
If you don't like my definition then I'm willing to continue this debate  <br>
using your definition regardless of what it is, provided only that it is <br>
precise and logically consistent.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;This gratutituous redefinition of "free will" to mean Turing non-        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;predictability in the AI, extropian, and scientific community is, in </i><br>
<i>        &gt;general, a strong testament  to the pervasiveness of "group think"         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, I've found that nearly everybody I meet on the street has exactly the <br>
same opinions I do.                        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;or "political correctness" </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Also true, as any long term member of this list will tell you, I've never  <br>
made a politically controversial statement in my life.                <br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The redefinition of words to new meanings is right up there with         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the Marxist rewriting of history.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of the Communist Party.<br>
