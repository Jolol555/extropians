It worked in an era when the media was controlled by corporations out to<br>
make a profit on weapons sales. Now the media is much more<br>
decentralized. SO alternate views to the official one gets much more<br>
credence and airtime.<br>

<p>
Your only cherry picking statements. You ignore my statement that Luna<br>
will not NEED to attack earth. Such a confrontation will require a first<br>
strike by earth.<br>
<p>
 People's capacity for a sense of civilization and humanity is fairly<br>
<i>&gt; proportional to their sense of safety.  The US public worries about</i><br>
<i>&gt; accidents and terrorism, not war, and doesn't currently condone dropping</i><br>
<i>&gt; nukes on small relatively helpless nations. </i><br>
<p>
Exactly, what part didn't you understand?<br>
<p>
 If a Free Luna was<br>
<i>&gt; portrayed as a threat, one they were reminded of everytime they looked</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the night sky... keywords: "panic".  "hysteria"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } in the US will have relatives on Luna and wont be happy at all with</i><br>
<i>&gt; } abandonment of their families. You really are rather blinkered.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The relatives of the convict losers you've been talking about populating</i><br>
<i>&gt; your colony with?  Big deal.</i><br>
<p>
Maybe to you, but those politicians most likely to oppose the use of<br>
such force have such people as their main constituents. Killing<br>
thousands of iraqis is no big deal, as they haven't anyone in congress.<br>
Killing a few hundred thousand relatives of AMericans is another ball of<br>
wax.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now _my_ population could get good PR.  Of course my population might not</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the guts to wage MAD against Earth.</i><br>
<p>
What? SNotty intellectuals? I would hardly think so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } them being wasted. You dont care because you don't know anything and are</i><br>
<i>&gt; } just too stubborn to admit you are wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There goes this debate.  Perhaps this applies to you?</i><br>
<p>
I really don't care. I know that any time people say something is<br>
impossible, someone else goes and proves them wrong. it happened with<br>
the Wright Bros., when the head of the Smithsonian Institution had<br>
previously said that heavier than air flight was impossible, it happened<br>
with Robert Goddard, when "experts" said that rocket engines would not<br>
work in a vacuum, it happened with Billy Dolittle, when the military<br>
experts of the day said it was impossible to sink a battlehsip with an<br>
airplane. All of these men went out and proved the so called "experts"<br>
wrong. <br>
<p>
Frankly I am surprised than anyone on this list would not have learned<br>
from such recent history.<br>
