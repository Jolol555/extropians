Yes, this is stated very well. The "disturbing" element that Tony mentioned<br>
may have more to do with stirring up people's misconceptions about<br>
Extropians. Transhumanists and Techno-Immortalist advocates (Cryonicists for<br>
example) are often seen by outsiders as " just another cult", " search for an<br>
eternal" - "a religion based on science" - "leaps of faith", etc. These kind<br>
of views are understandable, unless we correct them decisively.<br>
The major difference in *Extropians* ( Transhumans come in many shapes and<br>
sizes) is the basic objectivist notion that any form of mysticism is anti-<br>
life, deathist and self immolating. IMO, this sets a precendence for dynamic<br>
( as opposed to, I supose, passive or deathist) optimism (this Hale-Bopp<br>
incident is an example of the worst kind of passive optimism I have heard of<br>
to date).<br>

[BTW - Re: Godlike Uberpeople- I liked 'descrete individual' but think that<br>
semantically, God and Uber(over) are misleading because they conjure up<br>
images of cults and political memage of the past...and would prefer new memes<br>
to express improving humans that do not suggest (by proxy) "RULING" over<br>
inferior classes, but rather a progession of personal posthumanity.  I like<br>
that creative Extropians are always coining new phrases, and making new<br>
paradigms! Anyone take the bait?]<br>
