Since my name is still in here, (for some mysterious reason that evades me,<br>
as there are no quotes by me anymore), i'll jump in. <br>

<p>
Which is why equal chances in education are so important. And which is also<br>
why a zero starting position like Michael Suggests may not work, and where<br>
a starting situation that lies on that fuzzy treshold might. Problem is you<br>
can't accomplish something like that without redistributing wealth. Young<br>
adults have no wealth, and are therefore all by definition under that<br>
level. Taking money away from their parents is an option, but what the hell<br>
is the justification for such a system ?<br>
<p>
Topping off the results of peoples efforts, is the single most damaging<br>
thing to motivation for productivity increase today. (Mind you that I'm<br>
very much on the wrong side of that financial threshold myself, as i'm<br>
still young)<br>
<p>
In Europe exactly those social measures that where intended to redistribute<br>
wealth, are seriously hurting the effective social mobility. Young people<br>
who want to start businesses face a similar threshold, but one created by<br>
obligatory social and healthcare insurances, value added tax, and income<br>
tax which results in a bankruptcy ratio of two out of three the first year.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would this be an area where the traditional a-c opposition to </i><br>
<i>&gt;welfare might be relaxed?</i><br>
<p>
Social security was intended to be a 'catching net' for people who fall<br>
through the mazes of the system, it has completely lost that function.<br>
Money should be spent on re-educating people, helping people help<br>
themselves, not on keeping the pressure off the stability of the political<br>
system. This is Populism instead of social feeling.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Society does not owe anyone a living, but it does owe everyone an</i><br>
<i>&gt;opportunity to be productive and to be fairly rewarded for that</i><br>
<i>&gt;productivity.  Proposing the idea that society "owes" anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything will probably ruffle some feathers, but consider:  There is </i><br>
<i>&gt;little purpose in constructing a society of any kind if not for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;benefit of the members of that society.  </i><br>
<p>
Seeing the benefit that any productive individual contributes to the rest<br>
of us, i view the loss of such an individual and his possible contribution,<br>
as a loss to society. On that basis i feel the rest of us should feel<br>
'responsible' to some degree for that individuals chances for success.<br>
<p>
Besides providing education, theres the ethical question of not letting<br>
people starve to death, which i feel is a moral responsability, but it<br>
shouldn't go much further than food and shelter. (i'm not quite out of the<br>
medication part, as illness is not societies fault in any way, should it be<br>
it's moral responsability ? I like to think it is, but i haven't found a<br>
justification for it yet) <br>
<p>
If such a vision (that of the responsability for chances of success) is not<br>
shared, then why do we have children ? what is the reason to continue the<br>
human race ? Or is this maybe exactly why some of us seek life extension ?<br>
To rather be a big fish that owns the small ocean it lives in forever, than<br>
a little fish owning just part of the big ocean ? In other words: what is<br>
more important ? The more rapid growth of ones personal property or the<br>
(even) more rapid growth of the ocean ?<br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This is a decent idea so long as you don't propose taking wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; away from people. </i><br>
<p>
Exactly. In cases where market solutions cannot be found, we should at<br>
least *consider* auto-financing ones (non profit, but cost-covering)<br>
Non-profit, auto-financing institutions are doing very well in free market<br>
systems, and are subjected to the same rules of that free market. Moreover,<br>
anything one can come up with against them, based on unfair competition<br>
etc, severely limits the individuals choice not to make profit. It could be<br>
the perfect alternative to adapt altruistic or human/emotional tendencies<br>
to rational, market based systems. <br>
<p>
The fact that this option is so undervalued here, doesn't surprise me, but<br>
i can't help but be negative about the fact that so little effort has been<br>
made to find alternatives and second options. Dogmatism or extreme future<br>
optimism ?, the second is to be respected, but the boundries can be vague<br>
sometimes...  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;However, I cannot say that taking wealth away is unacceptable in</i><br>
<i>&gt;every possible case.  If an economy becomes so imbalanced that one</i><br>
<i>&gt;man owns everything, do the rest of us simply starve to death?   Such </i><br>
<i>&gt;a situation would most likely be corrected by a violent revolution.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Probably well before it became that extreme.  So when should the </i><br>
<i>&gt;killing start?  20% with 80% of the wealth?  10% with 90%?  1% with </i><br>
<i>&gt;99%?  One guy with everything?</i><br>
<p>
I'm still very positive that a system can be found that avoids such<br>
(dangerous) imbalances, without the need for redistributing wealth. And<br>
maybe even without the need for a state, and definitely without one that<br>
the individuals (are forced to) pay for. <br>
<p>
One of the positive characteristics of a free market is that it would<br>
boost economic growth enourmously, and the effects of even a growing<br>
imbalance, would diminish greatly. The way i see it conditions for this are<br>
a guaranteed coninued economic growth, population growth (educated) , and<br>
(continued) human expansion beyond it's current habitat (space- colonialism<br>
?). One flaw in the system that halts this (like a limit ?), and the walls<br>
come crumbling down though. That's when we need the alternatives you (and<br>
i) proposed, or preferably built in security measures that deal effectively<br>
(and coordinated, but exclusively for this) with crisis situations.     <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Put aside your distaste for </i><br>
<i>&gt;taxation for a moment and contemplate the outcome of this:  A 100% </i><br>
<i>&gt;post-mortem tax, but no other. </i><br>
<p>
I proposed it myself a few weeks back (in the thread that lead to a thread,<br>
that lead to this one), toyed with the idea, allthough not as radically as<br>
you have. And came to this conclusion:<br>
<p>
1) Why should the individuals power over his worldly posessions or his<br>
property end at death ? The individual is the one that aquired it,<br>
shouldn't he be the one to decide what happens to it ? <br>
<p>
One great thing about extropianism and transhumanist movements is that it<br>
tends to reject the powers nature (and all other) holds over the<br>
individual. Should it not be a beautiful thing for that rejection to<br>
include the loss of the power over ones property at death ? <br>
<p>
2) Extropianism pursues eternal life and life extension, viewed not only in<br>
this light, but also in the light of an ever increasing population growth,<br>
the system you propose would be like throwing water on a hot plate. <br>
<p>
Allthough i do not agree that everything proposed (yet) for a free market<br>
system will work, i have come to the realization that any solutions for<br>
problems left unanswered, must come from, or be adapted to the same<br>
background, the same set of ideas and laws, that are inherent to the<br>
theory, as much as possible, in order for it to work.<br>
<p>
Finding solutions, and proposing to implement them in ways that directly<br>
oppose the basis of such a system, has been my initial (and  occasionally<br>
still repeated) error as well.<br>
