&lt;...the writings of Daniel Quinn, who wrote ISHMAEL and THE STORY OF <br>

Salvationist religions of the world.&gt;<br>

Strange!  If you get to <a href="http://www.ishmael.com">http://www.ishmael.com</a> you're asked if you're <br>
ready to "save the world".  The 'yes' link leads you on into Quinn's <br>
mythos, while the 'no' link leads to a Web page on Julian Simon.  How <br>
is Quinn's stuff not a 'Salvationist religion'?!<br>
<p>
Anyway, Cyber Ed also wrote:<br>
&lt;Daniel Quinn has a theory that the human race went wrong about 10,000 <br>
years ago when it turned to totalitarian agriculture.&gt;<br>
<p>
Gee, New Age guru Jose Arguelles says (in his recently republished <br>
book _Earth Ascending_)<br>
&lt;through centuries of 12:60 (Solar calendar) maladoption, humanity has <br>
become magnetically destabilized.&gt;<br>
<p>
Arguelles answer is to get in touch with the "Psi Bank Matrix <br>
Generated as Binary Resonance of Radiation Belts".<br>
<p>
Now I'm so confused and don't know which way to look for salvation! <br>
 Maybe I'll just go see what julian Simon has to say...<br>
