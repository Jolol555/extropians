Not at all. They may know what Extropy means only through the<br>
representations of the artist. Or, more likely, the may know of both artist<br>
and other Extropians, but be more influenced by the artist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If the populace knows what</i><br>

<p>
The populace would believe the authenticity of that which they believe,<br>
which is not necessarily that which _you_ would wish them to believe.<br>

I didn't think I'd implied the opposite. In fact I have explicitly made the<br>
same point already. However, as I've said, artists only challenge the<br>
suppositions of the observers of their work. If no suppositions exist, then<br>
they are created, rather than challenged.<br>
