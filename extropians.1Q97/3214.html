I don't see a problem with this and being an individualist, and it is <br>
actually very good advice for making extropianism more reasonable to <br>
people - if you read about it in the newspapers, it is a weird cult, but <br>
your friend Hal is a decent chap with some good ideas. If we could be <br>
known as the local experts on the future and "big things", people might <br>
come to us to hear what this fuss about cloning or nanotech is.<br>
<p>
Myself, I try to influence some minds in the local community. Every<br>
wednesday I go to the local highschool where a teacher holds an "open<br>
house" for the kids to build electronics and play with the computers (the<br>
girls have just discovered IRC...). I sit there and talk about things with<br>
them, helping them out or suggesting fun things to do. Yesterday I<br>
explained memory and study techniques, the way the brain stores<br>
information and how to optimize sleep patterns to some of them, with good<br>
results. The fun thing is, that by trying to explain things you learn them<br>
better yourself, give hope to the kids (I live in the quite "less than<br>
fashionable" area Hagalund, and most of the kids are immigrant kids) and<br>
spread transhuman memes to the people who will grow up. <br>
