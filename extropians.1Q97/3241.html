Robin Hanson:<br>
<i>&gt;You would clearly be a very unhappy person had you not found friends</i><br>
<i>&gt;who share your values as closely as you think your friends do.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't begrudge those of us with very ususual values the benefits of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;diversity of associatations gained from a tolerance of different values.</i><br>
<p>
I'm going to try once more here to make myself clear here.  I never said <br>
that your friends have to completely agree with everything you value. <br>
I never implied that my close friends agree with everything I say or <br>
do.  I never said that I don't tolerate a wide spectrum of lifestyles <br>
or values in my own friends.  It would be completely unreasonable for <br>
me to expect my friends to be exactly like I am.  For you to make this <br>
assumption proves that you haven't listened to a darn thing I've been <br>
saying this entire time--my entire point was about acceptance of who you <br>
are as an individual versus mindless conformity to a group just to have <br>
friends.  You were the one complaining that you couldn't find any.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
