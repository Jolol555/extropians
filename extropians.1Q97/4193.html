A computer cannot be upset by the data being sent to it as this person<br>
has expressed. If the data a computer is sent is incompatible the<br>
program will either issue an objective error message or it will crash.<br>
The computer is effected, but not affected by the data. Humans are both<br>
effected and affected by the data which they recieve. I could program a<br>
computer to respond "Please get me off this mailing list!!" with two<br>
exclamation points, but the computer has not actually *felt* the need to<br>
express itself in that way. It was merely the logical way for it to act<br>
based on my programming of it. If my CNS effected only my thoughts and<br>
did not affect my emotions, then I would would be just like a computer,<br>
purely rational (cognitive) and lacking any irrationality (emotive).   <br>
<p>
By the way, I found John's post on the emotional computer extremely<br>
informative.<br>

Explore and play,<br>
