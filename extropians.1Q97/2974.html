Tomorrow morning I'll be interviewed by Canadian TV on extropian views on<br>
the cloning breakthrough. The show is Big Life on CBC and will be shown in<br>
Canada on Friday. (Feedback from Canada-based extropians very welcome.)<br>
<p>
I want to make a number of points, placing the cloning breakthrough in a<br>
broader context. In case I'm missing anything important that should be<br>
squeezed into my air time, I'm soliciting suggestions here. I intend to put<br>
cloning in the context of a broader growth of our ability to modify our own<br>
biology, and to make the political point that choices about cloning should<br>
be an individual matter, not a governmental policy. I will also suggest<br>
that the implications of cloning (even humans) is not particularly dramatic<br>
(though it is a sign of accelerated progress) since genetic engineering and<br>
other bio-modifications will be more radical.<br>
<p>
I also gave Wired News a quote and may do a longer story with them, so I<br>
can make good use of any clever suggestions that might help spread our ways<br>
of thinking to the public.<br>
<p>
(I should note that CBC is specifically interested in the extropian context<br>
and not simply narrow comment on the cloning thing itself. It seems that<br>
Extropian thinking is becoming recognized and that media people are<br>
beginning to solicit our views as a recognized group or school of thought.<br>
This is progress!)<br>

Onward!<br>
