<p>
Most ethical systems in use overlap to a great extent (almost all suggests<br>
that kindness is a good idea and practically none of them says killing or<br>
stealing are OK); this is IMHO due to memetic and social co-evolution,<br>
possibly with a biological component. Thus most of the ethical systems,<br>
regardless of what divine or philosophical support they claim, tend to<br>
uphold a generally functioning society of humans (if people actually <br>
behaved 100% according to them it would be even nicer, but most realistic <br>
ethical systems have a 'graceful breakdown' property: they work <br>
reasonably well even if not everyone follows them). <br>
<p>
What is surprising is that many "standard ethical precepts" like not <br>
killing can be deduced from my complexity ethics without adding extra <br>
assumptions; this suggests for me that it will be at least <br>
generally compatible with "standard ethics", that it might work in a <br>
social setting and that it is in some sense minimal, avoiding a lot of <br>
extraneous assumptions. Of course, making it work in practice is not <br>
always easy, and there are still some arbitraryness about 'diversity', <br>
but I think I manage to follow it in general.<br>

<i>&gt;           BTW, David Pearce has worked out a theory of why you are so </i><br>
<i>&gt;           fond of complexity. The basic idea is that your dopaminergic </i><br>
<i>&gt;           pathways are hyperactive, so that you almost never </i><br>
<i>&gt;           experience suffering. The closest you come to suffering is </i><br>
<i>&gt;           occasional *boredom*, which therefore, Pearce reasons, </i><br>
<i>&gt;           naturally becomes your notion of evil. But boredom is </i><br>
<i>&gt;           generally caused by repetition and monotony; hence </i><br>
<i>&gt;           complexity, its opposite, come to be seen by you as the </i><br>
<i>&gt;           supreme good. :-)</i><br>
<p>
Touché! I like this explanation, it seems to fit almost too well. Yes, I <br>
consider boredom one of the greatest evils in the universe, and that is <br>
one of the reasons I became a transhumanist in the first place. <br>
<p>
Hmm, I might get the chance to check out my CNS soon; I'll take a look at<br>
the dopaminergic pathways and see if the results support the theory. <br>
