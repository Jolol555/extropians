Question one: did we ever clarify whether we were talking about war<br>
between Earth and free Luna or an independence rebellion?<br>

Multiple missiles.  Habitats aren't going to be too secret; also<br>

I haven't heard this, but the Economist did have an article on the<br>
feasibility of such systems.  But the nukes could be big, shielded<br>
nukes.  Or mass drivers could be put into Earth orbit, so that both<br>
sides would be using the same weapons.  Luna probably has competitive<br>
advantage there, though.  I vote for big nukes.  And local ships and<br>
garrisons.<br>

I winced at claims of great intelligence infiltration, but I'm not<br>
convinced this would be true.  Building a large mass drive underground<br>
should be interesting.  Also, is the entire Moon one free power?<br>
Perhaps only one colony is rebelling or has rebelled, and there are<br>
other bases loyal to various Earth nations.<br>

<p>
I don't see how that can be accurate.  1 G at Earth's surface, 6000<br>
kilometers; at 12000 km g-force will be .25 G.  But a rock at rest at<br>
infinity (physics problem) would come down with escape velocity, 11<br>
km/sec=11000m/sec.  1 ton=1000kg.  1000*(11000^2)/2= 6.05e10 J.  I don't<br>
know how much energy is in a kg of TNT.  10^7 J?  Then the falling 1 ton<br>
rock would be 6 tons of TNT.  10^5 J?  600 tons.<br>

You're _assuming_ a dynamic of the people involved on the moon.  I<br>
consider various volunteers to be just as likely.  You're also assuming<br>
a single Earthgov now, which we're not exactly racing towards now.  I<br>
doubt that affects this argument much though.<br>

Preparation material involving an omniscient computer and a 10% chance<br>

masters of future waves of colonialism will have learned from the past,<br>
either to set up peaceful methods for secession (a la the Commonwealth)<br>

convicts to the top of the gravity well without guards!  Right.<br>
