A fairly long time ago, realizing that I was spending more time<br>
talking than doing, I unsubscribed from "Extropians", deciding it was<br>
a net waste of time for me. Recently, just for the heck of it, I<br>
joined again (getting the digest).<br>
<p>
A recent essay by "anonymous" claiming, essentially, that Extropians<br>
talk far better then they act, seems to have hit a nerve among many<br>
people who have written back denouncing the essay.<br>
<p>
I must say, however, that in my opinion there is much truth in what<br>
"anonymous" says.<br>
<p>
I dropped off the Extropians mailing lists many years ago largely<br>
because I realized that I was spending lots of time talking about how<br>
good it is to be a greedy rich bastard, and spending very little time<br>
actually becoming one. Long before that, I noted that many -- not by<br>
any means all, but many -- extropian types spent lots of their time<br>
talking a much better game than they played.<br>
<p>
The phrase "impoverished Extropian" should be an oxymoron, but there<br>
are, in fact, a number of people associated with the Extropian<br>
movement for whom the words "if you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"<br>
apply.<br>
<p>
Now, this isn't universally true among the Extropians I've met. Some<br>
are perfectly in control of their finances and either of independant<br>
means or well on their way to getting there.<br>
<p>
It is, however, disquieting to me that more Extropians I know have<br>
financial problems than the non-extropian members of the<br>
intelligentsia that I know. (I'd draw comparisons with "average"<br>
people in general but I don't spend time with many so I can't.) I<br>
would have expected this to be radically the reverse, given the<br>
laudible Extropian respect paid for capitalism, but somehow doctrine<br>
doesn't translate into action.<br>
<p>
This may be found in other venues as well.<br>
<p>
Many years ago, long before I first heard of Extropians, I switched<br>
from a high fat, meat oriented diet to a fairly healthy low fat vegan<br>
diet. I did this purely because I want to live a long time and be<br>
healthy while I'm alive -- a fairly common Extropian sentiment. When I<br>
first met fellow Extropians, I expected most of them would have<br>
similar dietary tendencies -- indeed, I expected them to be more<br>
radical than myself, given that many of them lived in California,<br>
which at the time was a much easier place to live comfortably while<br>
following an alternative diet.<br>
<p>
Instead, I discovered, much to my shock, that many Extropians (not all<br>
by any means, but many) did not translate their desire for long<br>
lifetimes into healthy eating -- probably the easiest form of life<br>
extension available, and provably far more efficient than the tiny<br>
edges most life extending substances yield. I met people happy to try<br>
taking deprinyl(sp?) but not very willing to give up a high fat diet,<br>
even though the former has substantially smaller effects on average<br>
longevity than the latter.<br>
<p>
Understand, I don't have trouble with the idea of taking life<br>
extending substances, but I would have thought that putatively<br>
rational people would go for the mechanisms with the biggest gain in<br>
average lifespan first before seeking tiny improvements.<br>
<p>
Anyway, in summary, I believe "anonymous" is probably extreme in<br>
lumping all extropians in to the same category together -- many are<br>
not the "altruists preaching selfishness" that "anonymous"<br>
decries. However, I will point out that a disturbingly large number of<br>
"Extropians" are, in fact, "altruists preaching selfishness", and that<br>
it is indeed somewhat disturbing that comparitively many do not<br>
practice what they preach.<br>
