<i>&gt;         I'm afraid that this extends to be more of a pesky memetic problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; than one of linguistics.  It is how people use the language...not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; language itself.  Ask Eugene Leitl...he'll tell you that there are 'sexist'</i><br>
<i>&gt; words in Germany; likewise, Anders could tell you the same for the Swedish</i><br>
<i>&gt; language.  Most words in *any* language are ambiguous, and thankfully so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ambiguity *increases* freedom of perception --it hones a language and gives</i><br>
<i>&gt; it character-- rather than illeviating such freedom.  So before we try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; quell certain words in English (why am I reminded of "1984"?), we should</i><br>
<i>&gt; modify the perception.  Personally, I have no qualms with the language...my</i><br>
<i>&gt; life is based upon it!  Enough rambling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                                 -E. Shaun Russell</i><br>
<p>
Nowhere have I suggested throwing away English, or drastically changing<br>
it (I have advocated minor changes like the gender-neutral pronouns I<br>
used in the Oceania constitution).  If you like its ambiguity for artistic<br>
reasons, then fine, go on using it for artistic prose and poetry and such.<br>
I'm rather fond of a good sonnet myself.<br>
<p>
I am a bit concerned at how good English and all other "natural" languages<br>
are at indoctrinating our cultural prejudices into the minds of our youth.<br>
<p>
My primary suggestion is that some functions of language, namely the<br>
effective communication of objective concepts, and the storage and<br>
retrieval of objective information (and I for one will not surrender<br>
to subjectivism by denying that those things exist), would best be<br>
served by another means of expression, and that the creation and use<br>
of that means would accelerate my ascension to transhuman condition.<br>
<p>
The particular means in which I find the most promise is Lojban,<br>
though I would add to it an ideographic writing system, a hypertext<br>
protocol, a gestural form, and some other tweaks.  I am certainly<br>
open to alternative ideas, but the only ones I've heard so far are<br>
half-assed attempts like Esperanto and E-prime.  Lojban is at least<br>
a three-quarter-assed attempt.  I am optimistic that it can do some<br>
great things, and I am puzzled by the lack of interest.  I will<br>
have to take it upon myself to do the work of further evangelizing<br>
it by making more materials available on my web site or elsewhere.<br>
<p>
Hey Max, would the magazine be interested in an article on it?<br>
