This is the self-defeating belief in a higher power. We would fall into<br>
the same category if we were to believe something such as a future<br>
artificial intelligence will one day save us, the artificial<br>
intelligence being our higher power. Higher powers are authoritarian and<br>
lead to subservience and sacrifice. I think this is a subtle issue we<br>
should be aware of in our development of technology. We have to caution<br>
ourselves from imagining the technology as something greater than<br>
ourselves, which might replace ourselves, when we can have a healthier<br>
outlook of technology as an augmentation or tool of refinement. <br>
<p>
As transhumanists and extropians I think we run the risk of making<br>
technology out to be the next saviour, the next higher power. You have<br>
the Church of Nanotechnology, and the Singularity Church, and the Church<br>
of the Almighty Artificial Intelligence, etcetera, etcetera. To avoid<br>
this sort of trap requires something more than a passive acceptance of<br>
technology into our "hearts" and minds. It requires that we take<br>
proactive responsibility for the creation of technology. We have to<br>
remember that technology is a means and not an ends. Technology exists<br>
for the sake of the person, and not vice versa. There is a freaky<br>
scientific *cult* out there which would like to replace man with<br>
artificial intelligence. Thats a religious sacrifice. <br>
<p>
I would rather create technology that helps ME evolve rather than<br>
technology that is suppose to replace me. Just as I won't sacrifice<br>
myself for a Nation, for a God, or for Aliens, I will not sacrifice<br>
myself for the sake of technology. I value my existence. I don't think,<br>
"there could be something better", but rather "I could be something<br>
better."<br>
<p>
Explore and play!<br>
