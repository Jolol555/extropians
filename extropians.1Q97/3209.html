Robin Hanson wrote 3/5/97: &lt;This year Strauss &amp; Howe came out with a<br>
sequel, "The Fourth Turning", endorsed by both Gore &amp; Gingrich....  So<br>
please listen when I say (and note how unusual this statement is): <br>
<p>
  STRAUSS &amp; HOWE ARE RADICAL, IMPORTANT, AND PROBABLY MOSTLY RIGHT!<br>
<p>
Also, amazingly enough Strauss &amp; Howe &amp; the most of the people<br>
attracted to them seem like relatively reasonable people...&gt;<br>
<p>
I perused this book carefully during a pleasant evening at Barnes &amp; Noble. <br>
Afterwards, I had one question:  why wasn't this book stacked in the<br>
Astrology/New Age section of the store?  Most of the people I see attracted<br>
to this section seem like relatively reasonable people, they would enjoy<br>
reading about Hari Seldon's hot date with Gail Sheehy - psychohistory meets<br>
psychobabble.<br>
<p>
Books like this on historical cycles have as much validity as calculating<br>
the positions of the planets when you are born, and then concocting<br>
interesting generalized theories about what's going to happen next.  I'll<br>
grant that the authors are a cut above the usual conjurer's tricks, they<br>
use more sophisticated smoke &amp; mirrors than Madame LaRue the Fortuneteller.<br>
 Their market-targeted readers are the tried-and-true gullible aging<br>
yuppies with the narcissistic urge to read about their life, have their<br>
palms read and have money to waste.<br>
<p>
The fallacy of analysis like this, is that you can start arbitrarily<br>
anywhere in history, in any given year, and make historical facts fit<br>
whatever cycle you choose, whether generational, sunspots, comet<br>
appearances, meteor showers, radioactive decay, climatological, you name<br>
it.  The Elliot Wave, the Kondratieff Cycle, business cycles in general<br>
fall into this type of false prophecy.  The authors of this particular book<br>
bend over backwards to mischaracterize historical events to include as<br>
"evidence" of some magic cycle, but completely ignore major events that<br>
fall outside of their "theory," hoping their readers had a good Outcome<br>
Based Education in history to not know any better.<br>
<p>
History is continuous, one year after another, no one year any different<br>
than any other year, every year of equal length.  No year is to be given a<br>
privileged position when starting a cyclical analysis.  There is no<br>
"generation" identifiable anywhere except in relation to yourself and<br>
yourself alone.  To arbitrarily assert otherwise is to commit a category<br>
error in analysis, unless simply telling a non-analytical story, such as<br>
"the Depression generation."  If history has any pattern at all, it might<br>
be of a fractal nature, self-similarity on different geo-temporal scales of<br>
periods of activity vs. quiescence.  I doubt anyone will ever make a<br>
rigorous analytical case for it; too many variables, it's an open system,<br>
not closed.<br>
<p>
In writing this book, I have the feeling the authors consulted the highest<br>
authority possible on their subject: P.T. Barnum.<br>
