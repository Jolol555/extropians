Well, this is a basic problem!  In America it is just plain difficult <br>
to get into techno, it's not a widely distributed or very accessible <br>
form of music.  Often there are cultural barriers to even getting to <br>
hear the experimental mixes--on the East Coast the really deep mixing <br>
can only be heard in gay clubs, and then that gets exported in a more <br>
watered-down form to other clubs or to a few top-40 songs.  A few <br>
radio stations have programs devoted to techno at odd hours on the <br>
weekends, if you can find them.  Add to that the ongoing squabbles <br>
over whose music is really "techno".<br>
<p>
Yet those artists that have managed to crack the barrier to <br>
widespread exposure (NIN, Manaheim Steamroller, Enigma) have proven <br>
that there is a market for electronic composition, and it seems as if <br>
awareness is growing, so maybe there is hope!<br>
