<p>
This is the reason some digital synths have randomizers/noise functions<br>
(Roland and others) as part of their signal generation path.  When working<br>
in a studio, I often find it hard to listen to digital synth sounds for<br>
extended periods of time.  It becomes difficult for me to focus on the sound<br>
after a couple hours.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Another effect of the digital synth revolution is the tossing away of</i><br>
<i>&gt;real-time control.  Analogue synths have lots of knobs to tweak the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sounds while you're playing.  Digital synths almost never do (cf. the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"revolutionary" new Kawai keyboard that adds the knobs back).  They</i><br>
<i>&gt;also added lots of presets (presets were very limited before).  And</i><br>
<i>&gt;synthesis methods such as FM were less amenable to real-time</i><br>
<i>&gt;tweaking.  All this conspired to make keyboard players click in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;preset, and leave the sound static as they played.</i><br>
<p>
I love knobs and sliders.  Paging through LCD screens is a real pain, and it<br>
requires intimate knowledge of the synth to do it effectively.  Supposedly<br>
revolutionary features like touch screens (a la Korg Trinity) do nothing<br>
more than move the buttons from the real to virtual without really changing<br>
the interface (and IMHO touch screens are worse than the usual buttons).<br>
<p>
I agree that presets are boring and often overused, but they do have their<br>
purposes.  There are some times when I need a particular sound for which a<br>
preset works just fine, without the need for any significant tweaking.  I<br>
always keep a couple Korg or Roland preset boxes around (usually expanded to<br>
capacity) even though much of my work is done on samplers and analogs.<br>
