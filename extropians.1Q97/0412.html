<i>&gt; I'm not sure what you think the Internet has to do with anarchy. It was</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed in the United States with government funding and functions at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the pleasure of a multitude of governments. Please clarify why you think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the Internet is an anarchy, I'm curious.</i><br>
<p>
The Inernet is an anarchy at the pleasure of governments is because<br>
governments know that scientists and engineers make the most progress<br>
when they have unbridled communication amongst themselves. The reason<br>
why the Internet is still an anarchy now that it has grown beyond that,<br>
is more a matter of the slugishness of govenrments, and the entrenched<br>
influence of people who have made fortunes off the internet. Notice how<br>
much effort is going on to reign it in these days?<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You are committing the naturalistic fallacy here. Just because a price</i><br>
<i>&gt; would naturally be X in a free market doesn't mean the price SHOULD be</i><br>
<i>&gt; X. Likewise, government frequently attempts to do good things (space</i><br>
<i>&gt; travel, quick economic recovery, for example) that would not happen in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; free market. That doesn't mean they OUGHT NOT to happen.</i><br>
<p>
Market prices are ALWAYS the proper prices, provided it is an<br>
uninfluenced free market. Also, the "good things" that government<br>
attempts to do are needed to fix the results of distortions in the<br>
marketplace by shortsighted laws and regulations. For instance:<br>
<p>
R&amp;D: Due to the influence of government manipulation and regulation of<br>
interest rates, long term investment is unprofitable, the majority of<br>
which is, lo and behold, involved in research and development....<br>
<p>
Space exploration: The original colony in Virginia was a PRIVATE<br>
venture, as was the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In fact, most of the<br>
original colonies here in the US were private ventures, as were many of<br>
the ventures colonizing central and south america. My own ancestors, who<br>
colonized Nova Scotia on a seasonal basis at first, were private<br>
fishermen fishing their secret spots (the Grand Bankes), long before<br>
Columbus (he got much of his navigational info from Scottish fishermen,<br>
who sent him further south hoping he'd get lost in the Sargasso Sea.<br>
The fact that the US space program has generated $14 in the economy for<br>
every $1 invested ( as opposed to $0.57 on the dollar for normal<br>
government) means that it is a profitable venture that should have been<br>
privatized a long time ago.<br>
<p>
Quick economic recovery: The things that government does best to<br>
stimulate economic recovery is to stop collecting taxes, stop spending<br>
money on obsolete resources, technologies, or jobs.<br>
<p>
ANything else we need government for? Deliver the mail cheaply maybe,<br>
HAH.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Modern communication, cryptography and untraceable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;digital cash will make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not likely. We may see a shift in the kinds of taxes paid, though. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; even sales taxes and income taxes are difficult to hide if one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; parties is a licensed business that must keep records and books.</i><br>
<p>
So a company pays your company for services rendered. you deduct all<br>
your expenses, and lo and behold, you LOST money. Gee, no income tazes<br>
this year....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;There is just</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;no getting around it, recent developments in mathematics and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;communication</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have tipped the balance away from the tax collector and in favor of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;tax evader.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I must not get your point. How does cryptography keep me from paying</i><br>
<i>&gt; property tax on my home, license tax on my car, income tax on my salary,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or sales tax collected by CompUSA?</i><br>
<p>
Salary from whome? If its your own company, there are already hundreds<br>
of thousands of people in the US who use that dodge every day. In NH you<br>
do not need a business license....Really Richard, this sort of thing<br>
goes on every day. Keeping two sets of books is easy, its hiding the<br>
second set that can be difficult once suspicions are raised. If you<br>
crypto your real books, they can't make you divulge the key, due to 5th<br>
Amendment protection against self incrimination. And, since the Income<br>
Tax is a voluntary system (really!) you are doubly protected. They have<br>
to prove it without your cooperation.<br>
<p>
Granted, under our present system, strong crypto will probably help<br>
organized criminals more than the average joe, but there wouldn't be<br>
organized criminals if there weren't laws against their activities.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The tribute that could still be extracted, like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;property taxes and  building permits, would have to be increased to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;astronomic levels and  collected with a heavy hand, a tax revolt will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;follow. Without money  government will grind to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;halt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not clear on which taxes you think would be unenforceable. The U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; government doesn't have a sales tax. Why would income tax become less</i><br>
<i>&gt; collectable? I don't see much effect at all on business taxes, which I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe are the bulk of income for the U.S. government.</i><br>
<p>
Any economic transaction that involved information. There is no cost for<br>
the duplication of information. Of course, this then brings up matters<br>
of property. You will need copyright protection from somebody. This<br>
could probably be performed by your insurance carrier and its associated<br>
contractors.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;                       &gt;Who would enforce it? The government?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;It's not clear to me what "it" refers to, I think you mean law and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;order and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;justice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry for the lack of clarity. I meant the state of anarchy. That is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; what is to prevent someone from setting up a government once your</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchy is established?</i><br>
<p>
Broad based guerrilla warfare, mutual assistance agreements among<br>
insurance carriers, and a tribe of Mikin like "Umpires" whose job is to<br>
go aaround looking for and stamping out signs of "bigness".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Consider what would happen if law and law enforcement were driven by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;market</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;forces. In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;desire to kill a stranger, even a Jewish stranger. Jews would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;pay as much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2%. As a result the PPA (private protection agency) protecting Jews</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;much  stronger than the  one that wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;things</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that are REALLY important to you ( like not getting  killed) you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more influence than just one man one vote.</i><br>
<p>
The big IF in stable anarchy is that a large majority of a population<br>
practicing such a system must 1) beleive in it, in the patriotic sense<br>
2) have a developed sense of informed, rational self interest. if you<br>
allow too many con artists of any type in, you'll destabilize things.<br>
Personal integrity is a must.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have trouble even getting into your head on this one, John. What the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nazis did WAS essentially anarchic. </i><br>
<p>
I would hardly call the SS a bunch of anarchists. What they did was<br>
legal by the laws of their nation. Trouble was, they made the laws....<br>
<p>
They illegally whipped up a bunch of<br>
<i>&gt; support for executing the Holocaust. How would it be any different under</i><br>
<i>&gt; an anarchy? And before modern enlightened government, slavery was common</i><br>
<i>&gt; and "natural."</i><br>
<p>
Slavery began as an effect of organized warfare, and maintained its cost<br>
effectiveness as a result of inefficient technology. First at the tribal<br>
level, then the clan level, and finally at City State and Nation level.<br>
"Natural" slavery was always more of an indenturement rather than a<br>
dehumanization. It took european christian self righteousness to<br>
transform that cultural tradition into a total abrogation of human<br>
rights, and the enforcement and approval of European Powers, as well as<br>
the Pope, were major factors in maintaining the legitimacy of it.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You keep assuming that in your ideal anarchic state, you could simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; allocate funds to your priorities and have them magically materialize.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Baloney! Wealthy people, large groups, people with connections have</i><br>
<i>&gt; exponentially more power than ordinary folks. With no laws regulating</i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior, there is nothing to mitigate this power. You will have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; country such as Thailand where laws are essentially unenforced and you</i><br>
<i>&gt; need connections to get anything done.</i><br>
<p>
Because the powerful use the government to enforce their will, and the<br>
people pay taxes in order to be repressed ( typical mercantilist<br>
operation). Privatize the bully gangs and you soak up capital of the<br>
rich and overbearing.<br>
<p>
The fact is Richard, is that without the drag on the economy of<br>
government, market prices would drop by an average of 60%, thus nearly<br>
tripling the disposable income of the average person. How much insurance<br>
could you buy from a competitive company for half that? How much of your<br>
own protection could you self fund with half that?<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; They could never get the upper</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;hand</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;because the  common man's PPA would be able to outspend a PPA that had</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;outrageous demands and was  just for the super rich. A yacht cost a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than a car yet the Ford motor Company is far richer than all the yacht</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;builders on the planet combined.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; People's wills and motivations are not driven by the amount of money you</i><br>
<i>&gt; pay them. </i><br>
<p>
Ever heard the term "Money talks and bullshit walks"? Granted many<br>
people demand a level of fulfillment with their jobs, but it is nowhere<br>
near the prime motivator.<br>
<p>
Napoleon remarked how amazing it was that a man would risk his<br>
<i>&gt; life for a shred of ribbon and a scrap of metal. Look at you: no one is</i><br>
<i>&gt; paying you to write these words. Likewise, you don't have to pay</i><br>
<i>&gt; soldiers much to beat people up.</i><br>
<p>
you are taking historical quotes completely out of context. In<br>
Napoleon's France, there was conscription, so if you weren't happy with<br>
ribbons and scraps of metal, they would just as soon shoot you. Most<br>
soldiers were the types that get nailed for jury duty today: they were<br>
too stupid and poor to figure out who to pay off and how much. In<br>
today's professional military, morale is currently in the sewer over pay<br>
and benfits cuts (while congress votes pay raises for themselves). These<br>
are people who make the militiary their careers, not just something they<br>
are forced to do. The feeling of patriotism does make for some<br>
compensation, which is why equally talented military people make between<br>
1/3 to 1/2 their civilian counterparts, but ribbons dont put food in<br>
soldiers' kids mouths.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And once you give the soldiers weapons, to whom are they accountable?</i><br>
<p>
Theri superiors, who are accountable to their organizations, who are<br>
accountable to either their governments, or if such is lacking, to the<br>
insurance companies that hire them.<br>
<p>
All a government is is an insurance monopoly. being a monopoly explains<br>
why they are so inefficient, expensive, and callous.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;It won't be perfect, there will still be brutality, but you have to ask</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;yourself, brutal compared to what? States? Governments, those paragons</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;charity and morality, those defenders of the weak and powerless, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;source</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of all virtue, have butchered hundreds of millions of people this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;century</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;alone, often their own citizens. We'd have to work very hard to break</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;record.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't recall the United States butchering hundreds of millions of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; own citizens this century. It seems to me that the butchering is on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; decline as governments become more enlightened, no?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Only because the vast decentralization of communications and information<br>
has made it much harder to hide such overt acts, for governments who are<br>
concerned about their public images domestically as well as<br>
internationally. More power to the people enforces and amplifies the<br>
popularity competition among governments, just like any free market.<br>
Governments are like school yard bullies: they only do what they think<br>
the can get away with, and are motivated chiefly out of fear.<br>
