<p>
                        STANDARD SOCIAL CONTRACT<br>
<p>
                Between ___________________________ and<br>
<p>
                THE GOVERNMENT OF CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA<br>
<p>
WHEREAS: I wish to reside on the Central North American Continent and;<br>
WHEREAS: The Central North American Government controls the area on which I<br>
wish to reside and;<br>
WHEREAS: Tacit and implied contracts are vague and therefore unenforceable;<br>
<p>
THEREFORE, I, THE SIGNER BELOW, agree to the following terms:<br>
<p>
SECTION ONE.<br>
        I will surrender a percentage of my property to the Government, such<br>
percentage to be determined by the Government and subject to change at any<br>
time at Government discretion. The amount to be surrendered may be based on<br>
my income, my net worth, the value of my purchases, or any other criteria<br>
the Government may choose.<br>
        To aid the Government in determining the percentage, I will apply for a<br>
Government Identification Number which I will use in all major transactions.<br>
<p>
SECTION TWO.<br>
        Upon Government demand, I will surrender my liberty for a period of<br>
time to be determined by the Government, typically no less than two years.<br>
During that time I will serve the Government in any way it chooses,<br>
including military<br>
service in which I may be called upon to sacrifice my life.<br>
<p>
SECTION THREE.<br>
        I will limit my behavior when and as demanded by the Government,<br>
including but not limited to the following: I will consume only those drugs<br>
permitted by the Government; I will limit my sexual activities to those<br>
permitted by the Government; I will forsake religious beliefs which conflict<br>
with the Government's determination of propriety.<br>
<p>
SECTION FOUR.<br>
        In consideration of the above, the Government will:<br>
        A. Permit me to seek employment, subject to any limits which might<br>
be determined by the Government, such as choice of career or wages I may accept.<br>
        B. Permit me to reside in the area of North America which it<br>
controls.          C. Permit me to speak freely, subject to limits to be<br>
determined from time to time by the President or his authorized<br>
representatives, the Congress and/or the Supreme Court.<br>
        D. Attempt in good faith to protect my life and my claims to any<br>
property it may have allowed me to keep.<br>
                [Note: I may not, however, hold the Government liable,<br>
                 or responsible, or accountable in the event it fails to<br>
                 successfully protect my safety or my property. The fact<br>
                 that the Government may deny me the right, or the means,<br>
                 of self-protection places no responsibility whatsoever<br>
                 upon the government for any injury or loss I may suffer<br>
                 as a result.]<br>
<p>
SECTION FIVE:<br>
        The Government may offer various services to me, the nature and<br>
extent of which shall be determined by Government and subject to change at<br>
any time, and for which I may be charged at whatever rate is determined by<br>
Government.<br>
<p>
SECTION SIX:<br>
        The Government will determine whether, and when, I may vote for certain<br>
officials, and the relative influence of my vote. The influence of my vote<br>
will normally vary inversely with the total number of voters, and I<br>
understand it typically will be of little or no consequence.<br>
        I agree not to hold any elected Government official liable for acting<br>
against my best interest or for failing to uphold oaths or promises, even if<br>
those promises motivated me to vote for them.<br>
<p>
SECTION SEVEN:<br>
        I agree that the Government may hold me fully liable if I fail to abide<br>
by the above terms in their entirety. In the event of such failure on my<br>
part, the Government may confiscate any property that may remain in my<br>
possission, and may imprison me for a period of time to be determined by the<br>
Government. I also agree that the Government may, at its discretion, alter<br>
the terms of this contract at any time.<br>
<p>
