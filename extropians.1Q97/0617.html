A question has been asked:  "I mean, the same chemicals that composed the <br>
"primordial soup" from which life arose on this planet, and perhaps elsewhere, <br>
would probably still be around today whether life arose or not. WHAT <br>
"SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE" IS THERE FOR THE CHEMICALS TO FORM INCREASINGLY COMPLEX <br>
PATTERNS?"<br>
<p>
There is no selective advantage for the chemicals to form increasingly complex <br>
patterns.  There are just so many chemicals all bouncing around and reacting <br>
with each other somewhat randomly on a huge planet, and in places, certain <br>
chemical systems *happen* to form which, because of the particular way they <br>
are arranged, happen to have the property of causing the surrounding <br>
environment to form very similar chemical systems, which also have the <br>
property of causing very similar systems to be formed.  The systems happen to <br>
have the property of reinforcing themselves, of maintaining their integrity <br>
and of causing more, similar systems to form.<br>
<p>
Because the environment in which these chemical systems form is varied, the <br>
"copied" systems are often disturbed in different ways, and they end up with <br>
different properties, sometimes becoming diffused, and sometimes becoming more <br>
self-reinforcing.  Because they are self-reinforcing and self-propogating, <br>
they tend to stick around and to spread; that's just the properties they have. <br>
 Variations appear, and some *happen* to be more self-reinforcing and/or more <br>
prolific (i.e. have more offspring).  <br>
<p>
There is no *drive* towards complexity.  It's just that when a random change <br>
happens to these self-propogating, self-reinforcing chemical systems that <br>
boosts these features, it tends to stick around, *by its very nature*.  <br>
Organisms are not *trying* to be healthier or have more children; it's just <br>
that when a modification comes along which *happens* to make them or their <br>
offspring healthier or more prolific, it sticks around, precicely *because* it <br>
caused the organism to have the property of being more successful in its <br>
environment.  <br>
<p>
The environment that organisms evolve in is quite varied; there are lots of <br>
different chemicals and lots of different temperature ranges, etc.  Because of <br>
these varied conditions, organisms that are more responsive and adaptive to <br>
their changing environment will tend to stick around.  More complex organisms <br>
tend to be more flexible and adaptive than simpler ones and can maintain their <br>
integrity better and have offspring more successfully than simpler ones, in a <br>
varied environment.  It's just the nature of the situation that the more <br>
complex organisms will be more successful in general than the simpler ones.  <br>
Also, these complex organisms cause the environment to become even more <br>
varied, requiring even greater complexity to stick around and generate <br>
offspring. Although, there are certain niches which don't vary all that much <br>
and organisms which have the properties of doing well in that niche remain <br>
fairly simple.<br>
<p>
The only *drive* to complexity is a varied environment.  All that does, <br>
though, is make it so that more elaborate systems will tend to be more <br>
successful than simpler ones in maintaining their integrity and generating <br>
offspring.  So when a random change comes along which mutates a system into a <br>
slightly more complex and successful system, it does better, simply because it <br>
*happens* to be more successful.  I'll just note that the mutated system only <br>
has to be more *successful*, not necessarily more *complex* to do better; it's <br>
just that a highly varied envionment seems to favor more complex systems, in <br>
general.<br>
<p>
Nothing really mysterious about it, any more than rolling a bunch of dice and <br>
keeping the sixes whenever they happen to come up and rolling the rest <br>
repeatedly until they come up sixes.  It's no surprise that you soon end up <br>
with nearly all, or all, sixes.  Just random variation and selection at work.  <br>
In this example, the selection criteria was that the die came up as a six.  <br>
Reality's selection criteria is that the system is able to maintain itself and <br>
produce more of itself.  Why this is the selection criteria is obvious, if you <br>
think about it:  the systems with those properties are the only ones that will <br>
stick around for long, *precicely because of those properties*.  They have the <br>
property of sticking around, so they *do* stick around. <br>
<p>
Sorry to belabour the point, for those who already understand this stuff, but <br>
it's amazing how few people really *understand* this simple concept.<br>
