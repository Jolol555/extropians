Newcomer, Joy Williams, has made a first public appearance on the Extropian <br>
List, and has thrown out many scraps of meat, to entice us to respond to.  A <br>
somewhat provocative introduction, talking about the "cold, technological <br>
world", about reincarnation, about Divinity, about death being "a part of the <br>
circle of life.".  Joy is basically Extropian, since the Extropian core is <br>
*basically* about finding better and better ways of doing things, and Joy is <br>
appearantly interested in that.  But I must address these other memes, <br>
especially the "cold, technological world" one.<br>
<p>
The idea that technology is "cold" comes from people who really don't know <br>
what they're talking about; who don't really understand what technology *is*.  <br>
"Technology" embraces nearly all aspects of human life.  How we walk is a form <br>
of technology, how we tie our shoes, how we kiss, how we make love, how we <br>
drink a glass of water, how we talk, how we sing, how we dance, how we cook <br>
our food, how we grow our food, how we build our shelters, how we study the <br>
world around us and learn to understand it more clearly.  Nearly everything we <br>
do is a form of technology.  Even our very minds are technological in nature, <br>
the very way we *think* has been shaped and tinkered with over many thousands <br>
of years by countless humans, an ongoing technological project, passed down <br>
from generation to generation.  Those who condemn technology as being "cold" <br>
are condemning Humanity itself.  We *are* technology.  Our minds and thought <br>
patterns are technology itself.  Even most of our emotional responses are <br>
*learned*, and thus technological in nature.<br>
<p>
Technology is *essentially* a learning process.  It is the way that humans <br>
understand their world and learn how to manipulate it.  Every one of us <br>
undergoes technological development, from the time we are infants.  When we <br>
learn how to move our bodies and move things around in our environments, this <br>
is raw technology at work.  Learning to walk is a technological endeavor.  <br>
Technology *is* learning.  Learning *is* technology.  Building nuclear <br>
reactors is not different in its basic nature than building sand castles or <br>
stacking blocks.<br>
<p>
Calling technology "cold" is a form of self-damnation and self-loathing.  It <br>
is the "original sin" doctrine in another form.  Our basic nature is as <br>
technological creatures, we are learning, manipulating beings.  That is what <br>
we *are*.  To condemn technology is to condemn learning, is to condemn oneself <br>
and one's very nature.<br>
<p>
Yes, people have certainly done a lot of damage to the environment, but that <br>
should not be blamed on *technology* itself, any more than it should be blamed <br>
on the laws of physics.  Technology is the process of learning.  Recognizing <br>
that certain ways of behaving are destructive to our environment is a learning <br>
process, and thus it is also technology.  Just because *some* forms of <br>
technology are harmful doesn't mean *all* forms of it are.  To expect that <br>
humans are going to get everything right the first time around is insane.  We <br>
are *learning*.  We have *never* done anything like what we are doing now, not <br>
on such a massive scale.  Of *course* we are going to make some errors.  We <br>
simply have to *learn* from those errors and modify our approach, not call the <br>
whole endeavor off.  The attitude of giving up whenever we face a few <br>
obstacles is a very immature and destructive attitude.  Unfortunately, this is <br>
the attitude many, if not most, environmentalists seem to have, regarding <br>
advanced technological development.  It's kind of like telling a baby to give <br>
up trying to walk because it falls down and skins its knees a few times, or to <br>
give up trying to feed itself because it's making a mess in its environment.  <br>
We must allow the learning process to continue.  It is self-correcting, in its <br>
very nature.<br>
<p>
<p>
Death has been a part of the complex web (not circle) of life, for all of <br>
life's existence.  Systems get destroyed.  That is part of the nature of this <br>
world.  However, I don't see how having the system that one is destroyed will <br>
make one's life better.  Death may be a part of life, but I don't see how it <br>
makes *my* life any better, when I'm the one doing the dying.  If we become <br>
immortal, then one could just as easily say that immortality "is a part of the <br>
circle of life".  Disease has a long tradition of being "part of the circle of <br>
life".  So does murder.  "It's just part of life."  Does that mean we have to <br>
accept it into our own lives?  No.  Just because something's traditional <br>
doesn't mean it's particularly ennobling, and it doesn't mean we have to <br>
maintain the tradition.  Death is simply a *tradition*; it is not essential to <br>
life itself.  I say:  Question Tradition.  Find better ways of doing things.<br>
<p>
<p>
When someone claims they have evidence that they have been reincarnated, I am <br>
very skeptical.  I study my dream state with great curiosity, and I notice how <br>
vivid all the images and situations appear to me.  I know how easily my mind <br>
can fool itself.  I also know how creative my mind can be and how it can <br>
compose very elaborate and convincing situations for itself to experience.  <br>
Having vivid memories of a past life is not sufficient evidence that one has <br>
actually been reincarnated, and more importantly, it is not sufficient <br>
evidence that one will be reincarnated after one's life ends this time.  <br>
People under hypnosis have been influenced to experience extremely vivid and <br>
believable hallucinations, even to not see things that were right in front of <br>
them.  Our minds are capable of extreme self-deception.  The evidence for <br>
*that* is quite clear.  In light of that evidence, memories of past lives <br>
should most reasonably be viewed as self-delusional.  Entertaining and <br>
educational, maybe, but fantasy nevertheless.  Practially speaking, one should <br>
make the most of *whatever* experiences one has, delusional or not, but I <br>
wouldn't bet my life on remembered past lives;  I wouldn't say "Oh, I'm just <br>
going to be reincarnated, so it's okay if I die."  <br>
<p>
<p>
As far as I'm concerned, the experience of the Divine is self-generated.  When <br>
one is out in a forest or on a high mountain and one feels one's deep <br>
connection to everything, the feeling is quite orgasmic, and we call it <br>
Divine.  The experience of the Divine is self-generated and masturbatory in <br>
nature.  The feeling is very real, but we are the cause of it.  It's basically <br>
a drug induced state of mind, like an orgasm is; it's just that the drugs are <br>
created by our own bodies, just like an orgasm.  The most potent drugs are <br>
produced right in our own brains.  Those, like myself, who have experienced <br>
these "Divine" states of mind, become very addicted to that drug-induced state <br>
of mind, and we work at finding more reliable ways to trigger this response <br>
within ourselves.  These methods are our rituals (a form of technology), which <br>
we modify and evolve, to make them more effective at producing the effects we <br>
want.  We are druggies, basically, trying to get our fix.  Pure hedonism.<br>
<p>
<p>
I welcome Joy Williams to the Extropan List;  I am sure that Joy has much to <br>
offer and can contribute to our lively discussions of all kinds of interesting <br>
things.  I am an Extropian who also, like Joy, embraces "spiritual" things, in <br>
the sense of being highly sensitive to the dynamics of life around me and <br>
becoming highly affected by beautiful experiences.  I work to maintain that <br>
beautiful background hum of bliss and contentment that marks the spiritual <br>
life, and I strive to deepen my awareness and appreciation of every detail in <br>
my life.  Extropianism is not against spirituality, but it *is* against dogma, <br>
because dogma closes one off to finding better ways of doing things, and <br>
finding better ways of doing things is the core of Extropianism.<br>
