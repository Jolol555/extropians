I'm not sure what you think the Internet has to do with anarchy. It was<br>
developed in the United States with government funding and functions at<br>
the pleasure of a multitude of governments. Please clarify why you think<br>
<i>&gt;the Internet is an anarchy, I'm curious.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Even if we make the ridiculous assumption that all politicians are</i><br>
<i>&gt;honest and </i><br>
<i>&gt;have boiling water IQ's they could never do as good a job as the free</i><br>
<i>&gt;market, </i><br>
<i>&gt;because they are lacking a vital ingredient, price information. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;true </i><br>
<i>&gt;price of an object is determined by an enormous number of variables and</i><br>
<i>&gt;is </i><br>
<i>&gt;much too complicated to be calculated from first principles, but the</i><br>
<i>&gt;market </i><br>
<i>&gt;will tell you what the price should be, no trouble at all. </i><br>
<p>
You are committing the naturalistic fallacy here. Just because a price<br>
would naturally be X in a free market doesn't mean the price SHOULD be<br>
X. Likewise, government frequently attempts to do good things (space<br>
travel, quick economic recovery, for example) that would not happen in a<br>
free market. That doesn't mean they OUGHT NOT to happen.<br>
<i>&gt;             </i><br>
<i>&gt;Modern communication, cryptography and untraceable</i><br>
<i>&gt;digital cash will make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes. </i><br>
<p>
Not likely. We may see a shift in the kinds of taxes paid, though. But<br>
even sales taxes and income taxes are difficult to hide if one of the<br>
parties is a licensed business that must keep records and books.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is just  </i><br>
<i>&gt;no getting around it, recent developments in mathematics and</i><br>
<i>&gt;communication  </i><br>
<i>&gt;have tipped the balance away from the tax collector and in favor of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;tax evader.</i><br>
<p>
I must not get your point. How does cryptography keep me from paying<br>
property tax on my home, license tax on my car, income tax on my salary,<br>
or sales tax collected by CompUSA?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The tribute that could still be extracted, like</i><br>
<i>&gt;property taxes and  building permits, would have to be increased to </i><br>
<i>&gt;astronomic levels and  collected with a heavy hand, a tax revolt will</i><br>
<i>&gt;follow. Without money  government will grind to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;halt. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not clear on which taxes you think would be unenforceable. The U.S.<br>
government doesn't have a sales tax. Why would income tax become less<br>
collectable? I don't see much effect at all on business taxes, which I<br>
believe are the bulk of income for the U.S. government.<br>
<i>&gt;                              </i><br>
<i>&gt;                       &gt;Who would enforce it? The government? </i><br>
<i>&gt;                         </i><br>
<i>&gt;It's not clear to me what "it" refers to, I think you mean law and</i><br>
<i>&gt;order and </i><br>
<i>&gt;justice.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry for the lack of clarity. I meant the state of anarchy. That is,<br>
what is to prevent someone from setting up a government once your<br>
anarchy is established?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Consider what would happen if law and law enforcement were driven by</i><br>
<i>&gt;market </i><br>
<i>&gt;forces. In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than</i><br>
<i>&gt;the </i><br>
<i>&gt;desire to kill a stranger, even a Jewish stranger. Jews would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;willing to </i><br>
<i>&gt;pay as much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth</i><br>
<i>&gt;not to </i><br>
<i>&gt;be killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much</i><br>
<i>&gt;beyond </i><br>
<i>&gt;2%. As a result the PPA (private protection agency) protecting Jews</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;much  stronger than the  one that wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;things </i><br>
<i>&gt;that are REALLY important to you ( like not getting  killed) you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;much </i><br>
<i>&gt;more influence than just one man one vote.  </i><br>
<p>
I have trouble even getting into your head on this one, John. What the<br>
Nazis did WAS essentially anarchic. They illegally whipped up a bunch of<br>
support for executing the Holocaust. How would it be any different under<br>
an anarchy? And before modern enlightened government, slavery was common<br>
and "natural."<br>
<p>
You keep assuming that in your ideal anarchic state, you could simply<br>
allocate funds to your priorities and have them magically materialize.<br>
Baloney! Wealthy people, large groups, people with connections have<br>
exponentially more power than ordinary folks. With no laws regulating<br>
behavior, there is nothing to mitigate this power. You will have a<br>
country such as Thailand where laws are essentially unenforced and you<br>
need connections to get anything done.<br>
<i>&gt;             </i><br>
<i>&gt;And it doesn't mean justice only for the rich. If a rich man's PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt;makes </i><br>
<i>&gt;unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice,  I insist on my</i><br>
<i>&gt;mother </i><br>
<i>&gt;being the judge if I get into trouble)  it's  going to need one hell of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a lot </i><br>
<i>&gt;of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is expensive because</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;hardware needed and because of the very high wages it will need to pay</i><br>
<i>&gt;its</i><br>
<i>&gt;employees for an extremely  dangerous job. To pay for all this they</i><br>
<i>&gt;will need </i><br>
<i>&gt;to charge their clients enormous fees severely limiting their customer</i><br>
<i>&gt;base </i><br>
<i>&gt;and that  means even higher charges. They could never get the upper</i><br>
<i>&gt;hand </i><br>
<i>&gt;because the  common man's PPA would be able to outspend a PPA that had </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;outrageous demands and was  just for the super rich. A yacht cost a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt;more </i><br>
<i>&gt;than a car yet the Ford motor Company is far richer than all the yacht </i><br>
<i>&gt;builders on the planet combined. </i><br>
<p>
People's wills and motivations are not driven by the amount of money you<br>
pay them. Napoleon remarked how amazing it was that a man would risk his<br>
life for a shred of ribbon and a scrap of metal. Look at you: no one is<br>
paying you to write these words. Likewise, you don't have to pay<br>
soldiers much to beat people up.<br>
<p>
And once you give the soldiers weapons, to whom are they accountable?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It won't be perfect, there will still be brutality, but you have to ask</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself, brutal compared to what? States? Governments, those paragons</i><br>
<i>&gt;of </i><br>
<i>&gt;charity and morality, those defenders of the weak and powerless, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;source </i><br>
<i>&gt;of all virtue, have butchered hundreds of millions of people this</i><br>
<i>&gt;century </i><br>
<i>&gt;alone, often their own citizens. We'd have to work very hard to break</i><br>
<i>&gt;that </i><br>
<i>&gt;record. </i><br>
<p>
I don't recall the United States butchering hundreds of millions of its<br>
own citizens this century. It seems to me that the butchering is on the<br>
decline as governments become more enlightened, no?<br>
