Mike Cowar simply asks, "What is reality?"<br>
<p>
This is a very difficult question to answer.  Especially since it's not really <br>
clear what the question is even asking.  Usually, when we ask "What is...?" <br>
questions, we are asking it about a particular object or phenomena.  For <br>
example, if I asked, "What is an apple?", you could present me with an apple <br>
and say, "This is an apple."  Then I could study the apple in various ways to <br>
gain a deeper understanding of its properties.<br>
<p>
You ask, "What is reality?"  So, I present you with reality.  Here is reality; <br>
it is right before you now.  Here it is.  What do you want to know about it?  <br>
Do you want to know what color it is?  What it weighs?  How big it is?  All we <br>
can do is study the properties it exhibits to us and make inferences, based on <br>
that.<br>
<p>
All we have is our experiences.  Nothing more.  Our experiences are basically <br>
sensory data patterns.  The sensory patterns interact in various ways in the <br>
large bundles of nerves that make up the nervous system, and produce thoughts <br>
and consciousness.  All any of us has is sensory patterns flowing in, <br>
regularities building up coherent patterns over time.  Certain types of <br>
sensory experiences are repeated in consistent ways, and we learn to <br>
anticipate them, to expect them.  We learn, over time, to influence our <br>
sensory environment is somewhat consistent ways.  Certain types of thinking <br>
influence the patches of color we call "hands", and we can position those <br>
patches of color near other patches of color, and by modulating our thoughts <br>
in certain ways, the patches of color in our visual field change in certain <br>
ways as our "hands" "move" "objects".<br>
<p>
Over time, we learn how to modulate our thoughts in various ways to achieve <br>
the results we want in our sensory environment.  We learn how to walk and move <br>
things around, how to make patterns of sounds, which cause other sensory <br>
objects, called "people" to make sounds in certain characteristic ways and to <br>
move in certain ways.  Over time, we build up a representation of the way our <br>
sensory reality works and of successful strategies for influencing it to <br>
achieve the results we are driven to pursue.  As our minds adjust to the <br>
regularities of the patterns of sensory information, we call this "developing <br>
an understanding of reality".<br>
<p>
What is reality?  I don't know.  All I have is my experiences.  I've noticed <br>
certain regularities to my experiences, and I can group things into <br>
categories, according to similarity.  I can use these regularities to make <br>
inferences about the underlying structure of my experiences.  Sort of like if <br>
I am given a sequence of numbers (e.g. 1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, <br>
111...) and I find an underlying pattern to the whole thing.  Then I can <br>
reduce this list of numbers to a more simple statement of the underlying <br>
pattern, which can be used to regenerate the sequence of numbers.  All I was <br>
given was the numbers; that was like my sensory data, and I looked for and <br>
found an underlying pattern to that data.  When I have that underlying <br>
pattern, I would say that I "understand" the sequence of numbers.<br>
<p>
All we have available to us is sensory data.  To "understand" that data, we <br>
must find consistent regularities in it.  We are looking for the underlying <br>
pattern.  For example, we can study the way objects fall, looking at how their <br>
velocities change as they fall.  When we do this, we notice a consistent <br>
pattern among falling objects.  We notice that they accellerate as they fall, <br>
and that, when there is no air resistence, they all accellerate at the same <br>
rate, towards the same large mass. Science is basically a matter of finding <br>
patterns in sensory data.  <br>
<p>
We have no idea what is generating the data we experience.  All we have is the <br>
data itself.  We don't even know what the data itself *is*; we just have it, <br>
and we find patterns in it.  We don't know why there actually is data, rather <br>
than no data, or why there is this particular set of data patterns that we <br>
encounter, rather than another, or what kinds of data patterns are possible <br>
and why.<br>
<p>
We really don't know what's going on here.  We just sort of find ourselves <br>
here and we try to understand it the best we can and try to make things be the <br>
way we want them to as best we can.  That's all we can do.<br>
