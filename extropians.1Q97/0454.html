<i>&gt; conscious ,and commucative, would be utterly ignored by our probes.</i><br>
<p>
I don't recall if the last time I argued this was just on &gt;H or here, so<br>
I'll recap:<br>
<p>
While some people have postulated the possiblity of life based on<br>
silicon, it simply does not have the same number of possible valence<br>
combinations as carbon does. While silicon life may form in some carbon<br>
poor regions of the universe (unlikely that such a state could exist,<br>
but not impossible), anywhere where carbon is in its normal abundance,<br>
and temperatures exist between -20 C up to 150 C, and there is water,<br>
life will form around carbon. Any silicon based primitive life forms<br>
will quickly be pushed out of the competition for resources with its<br>
carbon cousins because of carbon's greater ability to form complex<br>
molecules.<br>
<p>
So we know that carbon life will dominate, at least on Earthlike worlds.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, any possible life forms developing on planets vastly<br>
dissimilar to our own would of neccessity have vastly different goals, <br>
resource needs, and would not compete with us for planets, as what we<br>
would find optimum would not neccessarily be optimum for such vastly<br>
different life forms, so we would probably have little interaction<br>
outside of information trade, assuming that we could even communicate.<br>
<p>
So, given this, our greatest probable interactions with alien life forms<br>
will be on earthlike worlds, or near earthlike worlds (as such will be<br>
our main objects of attention for colonization), enough that they will<br>
be carbon based life forms that we will deal with.<br>
<p>
Now given this, we can look at the various life forms developed on our<br>
own planet (while this may seem limiting, it is the only dataset we can<br>
go on at the moment). I beleive that given the separation of continents<br>
for millions of years is sufficient to derive a decent idea of what sort<br>
of differentiation we can expect, as each has been a world unto itself<br>
more or less, especially with Australia, Central Africa, many Pacific<br>
Islands, and the Americas.<br>
<p>
Many Pacific islands are useful in that they demonstrate both the<br>
potential and the limits of flying creatures to fill evolutionary niches<br>
free of other animals. Given a lack of competition from apes or other<br>
intelligent creatures, birds were not able to develop any decent levels<br>
of intelligence, mainly due to the limits of the mass fraction. The<br>
weight restrictions of flight make large brains an evolutionary<br>
disadvantage.<br>
<p>
If we are talking about interacting with intelligent life, we have even<br>
narrower specs to make extrapolations with. We can look at: Humans,<br>
chimps, gorillas, porpoises and the other cetaceans (any other high<br>
brain to body mass creatures?). So we can basically look at the<br>
evolution of apes and cetaceans for clues as to _HOW_ they got where<br>
they are. NOTE: I am _not_ saying that intelligent aliens will be apes<br>
of cetaceans.<br>
<p>
Given that apes and dolphins are capable of being taught to interpret<br>
human language indicates that they are possibly not that far behind us<br>
evolutionarily. However, what distinguishes us is that we INVENTED<br>
language, and the tools we use. While some tool use is seen among apes<br>
and dolphins, it is typically  haphazard and quickly forgotten<br>
occurences. There is not that much environmental pressure to continue to<br>
use tools or develop more complex ones, as both species tend to have a<br>
higher eat or be eaten ratio than the early humans did, so are not that<br>
HUNGRY.<br>
<p>
There is also another interesting datum: brain case to cervical cavity<br>
ratio. Find animals that have large cervical cavities, or find the<br>
environmental pressures that lead to the development of such large<br>
cavities, and you can develop an idea of what sort of creatures are<br>
capable of givng birth to big brained offspring. Even for ourselves, we<br>
need the fetus to have a brain case that is not fully developed yet in<br>
order to give birth, so it can squeeze through.<br>
<p>
it turns out that a bipedal gait can acommodate a large cervical cavity<br>
rather handily, supposedly much easier than quadrupeds, from a<br>
mechanical standpoint, so we can infer that large cervical cavities<br>
denote a relative evolutionary disadvantage for quadrupeds.<br>
<p>
So now we know that an intelligent life form on another earthlike world<br>
will most likely be a carbon based biped. We can also infer that due to<br>
efficeincy/performance of optical/auditory arrangments, that the biped<br>
will have two eyes, as well as two ears. Will it see in our visible<br>
range? That depends on the spectra of the sun around which the planet<br>
orbits, but there must not be a high level of UV, as UV breaks down DNA<br>
rapidly and kills microorganisms, esp. the plankton. Given the spectra<br>
that an oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere, with a protective EM radiation belt,<br>
allows through, the peak output of a near sunlike star at planetary<br>
surfaces will be in the visible and near visible range. Evolution will<br>
take advantage of that, and eyes will develop sensitivity to whatever is<br>
most efficient, i.e. the visible range. Since two eyes is the minimum<br>
needed for stereoscopic vision, evolution willnot waste time with a<br>
third eye, and likewise for ears.<br>
<p>
This doesn't seem like that weird of an ET now does it?<br>
