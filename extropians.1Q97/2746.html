Sorry, this just doesn't wash.  People knew damn well what was going on<br>
(well enough to know it was wrong), same as in Germany and Poland where<br>
they had concentration camps next door.  They just rationalised/justified<br>
it, same as people rationalise/justify government. What changed things<br>
was people *declaring* that it was wrong, and declaring that the<br>
rationalisations and justifications were excuses for evil.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;It just makes no sense at all to argue about how to make something evil</i><br>

It's not that I object to finding ways of making govt. do less damage (I<br>
am a gradualist myself); it's just that I heard no moral condemnation<br>
in your original post.  I think you've got to speak plainly on these<br>
issues: "Look, this government business is evil, we must get rid of it,<br>
but for various reasons we can't do so in one stroke, so here's some<br>
stuff we can do meanwhile to lessen the evil, on the way to stopping it<br>
for good."<br>
<p>
It makes more sense to talk that way, I think, than to sort of fall<br>
in with the general line while sneakily trying to subvert it.<br>
