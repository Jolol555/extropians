<p>
Yes, but with Blowfish and RC4 an attacker does not know what the lookup <br>
tables are.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>                   &gt;cryptosystems with opaque tables should win.</i><br>
<p>
                       <br>
DES was made public by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 1975 and it  <br>
certainly has lookup tables, but until 1990 nobody outside of the NSA   <br>
understood why the table, called the S box, had the numbers in it that it did.  <br>
They were truly opaque.<br>
<p>
In 1990 Biham and Shamir discovered Differential Cryptanalysis, rediscovered  <br>
it really, because it was found that the S box in DES was optimized to make <br>
Differential Cryptanalysis difficult. Clearly somebody at the NSA knew about <br>
Differential Cryptanalysis in 1975 and probably much earlier, but the rest of<br>
the world didn't know about it till 1990.<br>
<p>
In 1993 Matsui discovered Linear Cryptanalysis and it was found that the <br>
S box in DES was NOT optimized to defend against it, in fact, if you picked <br>
numbers  at random to fill the S box there is only a 9% chance it would work <br>
as poorly against a Linear Cryptanalysis attack as the one the NSA gave us. <br>
Either the  NSA  didn't know about Linear Cryptanalysis in 1975 or they<br>
deliberately gave it a weakness.<br>
<p>
Blowfish has something like an S box, but it is key dependent so is unknown  <br>
to an attacker. The very simple RC4 algorithm generates a lookup table from  <br>
the key too, and then constantly mutates it as you use it, this  makes using <br>
Cryptanalysis much more difficult, perhaps impossible.<br>
