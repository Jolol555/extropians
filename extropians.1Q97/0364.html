IF that is his argument, I would suppose that he would also use the fact<br>
that the genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees is only 2%.<br>
By his reasoning then, women would be halfway between the two.<br>

Flame away.....<br>

<i>&gt; The question for extropians is what is the nature of genius.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that by some particular measure (say SATs), men dominate in</i><br>
<i>&gt; large numbers tells us interesting things that deserve study.  What</i><br>

<i>&gt; they are treated in society, the ideas about sex propogated by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; popular media, and yes, even their biology and social evolution,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that may have led to this state of affairs, and how can we apply</i><br>
<i>&gt; these conditions to more potential geniuses?  What is it about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; nature of our measurement that might be biased?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Let us strive to find more facts not to justify prior conclusions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but to suggest, criticize, and realize new possibilities.</i><br>
<p>
Very true, I think the big crime is the waste of genius of any kind no<br>
matter what its gender or other origins. Keeping ones political head in<br>
the sand at the expense of getting to the bottom of the problem is just<br>
as criminal as racism or sexism, possibly even more so.<br>
