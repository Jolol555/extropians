I feel a need to either argue or clarify this point. Value is intrinisic<br>
to meaning. Something without value is meaningless, and there is nothing<br>
meaningful without value. You say that soap operas on TV have meaning to<br>
you, but zero value to you. My argument is, if you did not value soap<br>
operas then you would not expend the energy necessary to give them<br>
meaning. We ignore what we do not value. Its a natural part of our<br>
perceptual process. If I do not value a noise in the room I am in, then<br>
it becomes ambient, attentuated, and I thus expend little to no energy<br>
on percieving it. If I do not value a persons opinion or the prospect of<br>
debating it, then I will ignore them entirely. I am not going to waist<br>
energy on them. I think the difficulty here is that we often only think<br>
of value in positive terms, but our values create a continuum from good<br>
to bad, like to dislike. Your value for soap operas is perhaps very low,<br>
but you do value them, or the thought of them would not ever cross your<br>
mind. You certainly would not correlate meaning with them if you did not<br>
value them to some degree.<br>
<p>
The only things we do not associate value with are those things which we<br>
are indifferent to. As soon as anything catches our focus and interest,<br>
we begin to dynamically associate value and meaning with it. This<br>
includes things which we find repulsive or threatening.<br>
<p>
Buddhists are particularly apt at indifference. Their religion requires<br>
that they overcome the "illusion" of value and meaning [because "life is<br>
suffering"] so that they can cease to re-incarnate.<br>
<p>
Existentialists are also so apt. Except they have taken it beyond<br>
Buddhism to the point where there is not even meaning in the lack of<br>
meaning. Existentialism taken to the extreme becomes paralysis. If posed<br>
with the question, "To be or not to be?", an existentialist cannot<br>
answer either way, because neither matters, and thus both are<br>
meaningless. Few people remain existential for very long, and fewer yet<br>
claim they ever were. Most people realize how futile it is to attempt to<br>
live without value or meaning. So from the existential realization that<br>
their is no intrinsic meaning or value in life, an existentialist will<br>
usually come to the conclusion that it is their responsiblity to create<br>
value and thus meaning.<br>
<p>
Something is only as meaningful as we appreciate it. Life is meaningless<br>
when we are incapable of appreciating it. To the degree that we can<br>
appreciate things is to the degree in which we can create meaning.<br>
<p>
The depth of our ability to appreciate also mirrors the depth to which<br>
we are able to create meaning. If a person is only able to appreciate<br>
things as either weak or strong, that person is not going to be capable<br>
of creating much meaning about things. We would consider this person<br>
shallow. They are not employing a significant number of ways to judge<br>
the value of something. However, a person who can percieve things as<br>
weak and strong, ugly and beautiful, and worthy and worthless will be<br>
able to create that much more meaning for things. A person who can then<br>
take these dichotomies and differentiate finer and finer transitions<br>
between them will be still more capable of creating a refined sense of<br>
meaning for something. We might call the latter person a connoisseur.   <br>
<p>
For me, ecstasy qua self-epiphany is "The meaning [and purpose] of<br>
Life", it is the climax of being. It is for the sole purpose of<br>
achieving novel, more complex, and more subtle forms of ecstasy that I<br>
wish to attain immortality. However, if I did not value myself and how I<br>
can make myself feel, then It would be meaningless for me to seek<br>
immortality. Ecstasy, my self, and Life would be meaningless to me<br>
without pleasure, my most primal sense for determing value. <br>
