(about  creativity and neural nets)<br>
&lt;&lt; I'd quibble over words here, though I basically agree.  Learning neural <br>
 nets demand _feedback_.  Creativity is an artifact, not a neccesity.<br>
<i>   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 This statement baffled me, explain please?<br>
1. define creativity<br>
2. define artifact<br>
3. explain how one can identify which brain functions are neccesary, and by<br>
what standards ( eat, poop, breathe? ), <br>
<p>
(snip)<br>
&lt;&lt;That's part of it.  Letting one's train of thought jump the tracks is<br>
merely<br>
daydreaming or smoking dope.  Anyone can do that.  The essential part of <br>
creativity is doing something with that meandering thought; getting it to<br>
alight on another - perhaps new - track.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
This is true, except that one need not always ACT on a creative thought for<br>
it to be valuable. It need not even be coherent to stir new thoughts into<br>
fruition.<br>
And, further,  acting on it does not make it meaningful, by itself.<br>
For example, in time, we may discard an old idea for a new one - as we did en<br>
masse, replacing Newton' universe with Einstein's.<br>
I suggest that Natasha's statement about "training the brain" begins with<br>
many excursions into thoughts that do not become concrete, as well as those<br>
that do. This is an important part of that part of our creativity processor,<br>
fermenting as it were, new and useless ideas into ones that may later bear<br>
fruit.<br>
<p>
You also  say that loose thinking equals insanity ( probably not very<br>
defendable, but a common entropic thought, as is your hypothesis that artists<br>
in general tend towards insanity more than other gropus, which is not<br>
supported by any evidence  BTW). Can you show me how you came to this<br>
conclusion?<br>
