Hardly. Unless we are talking megaengineering, the weather contains so<br>
large amounts of energy that it would be very costly and inefficient to<br>
force the system in the direction you want - a cubic kilometer of air<br>
moving at the leisurely pace of 1 m/s would contain 5*10^8 J of just<br>
kinetic energy. <br>
<p>
What you can do is of course physical juijitsu - redirect the energy <br>
slightly in an useful manner and let physics take its course. This is <br>
how control of chaotic systems work, and it seems to me that the only <br>
workable large scale weather control methods would be based on nudging <br>
the weather into the right attractor instead of trying to force it there <br>
(which is bound to cause chaotic oscilliations and other trouble). <br>
Managing microclimate is another thing (I like Daedalus suggestion about <br>
using microwaves to force rain from clouds to keep them away from certain <br>
areas). <br>
<p>
This relates to weather prediction, of course. The reason we can't <br>
predict the weather well is that it is too chaotic. Even if we did get <br>
enough sensors to keep track of it on a quite local scale it would still <br>
surprise us after a while; judging from the lyapunov exponents I have <br>
heard of detailled predictions beyond a week are simply not possible <br>
unless you place several sensors in every cubic kilometer.<br>
<p>
Chaotic dynamics is both our friend and foe; fortunately we can use its <br>
capriciousness. <br>
