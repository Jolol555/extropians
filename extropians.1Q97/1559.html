I don't know if anyone else has thought about this, but....<br>
<p>
Now that WebTV is out, it's only a matter of time until it's built<br>
into TVs (I had thought in time for Christmas, but when I found out<br>
that Sony was making it, I revised my estimate to Father's Day).<br>
<p>
There's also videophone that displays on your TV (oh, I see a new<br>
dial-a-porn boom coming...).<br>
<p>
Right now these things require cable, but the satellite people have<br>
got to be working on it.  After that, the cell phone people will get<br>
into the act.  Combine this with the Sony (!) Watchman, and you're<br>
most of the way to a Dick Tracy wrist communicator that also surfs<br>
the Web!<br>
<p>
I love it!<br>
<p>
