I am one of the Extropian elite?  Why wasn't I told about this before?<br>
I don't recall applying for the position...<br>

I must confess that this was among my primary initial attractions to<br>
computers.  To hard-core computer types, this statement is truer than most<br>
people know.<br>
<p>
<p>

<i>&gt;Rank these tenets of extropianism in order of personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;time-spent-thinking-about:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A) Nanotechnology        B) Singularity                C) Libertarianism</i><br>
<i>&gt;D) Space travel          E) Intelligence amplification F) Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt;G) Cryonics              H) Artificial intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt;I) Postbiological bodies J) Uploading   O) _____________________________</i><br>

<p>
<p>
This list is incomplete if it is to include the full scope of Extropian<br>
thought.  What about ethics and morality? art? philosophy? psychology? memetics?<br>
<p>
There is something inherently dangerous in ranking the "tenets of extropianism".<br>
Group concensus and level of interest do not impart any type of objective<br>
importance or value on a topic or area of study.  Although I do have<br>
preferences (=time-spent-thinking-about) for some topics over others, I will<br>
abstain from this survey.  I do not want to unintentionally lend unwarranted<br>
importance to a subject by force of topical popularity.<br>
