Did he really?  How fascinating!  Well, then I'd say that to really<br>
understand what van Gogh was on about, you'd have to have drunk absinthe<br>
at least once.<br>
<p>
You see, I'm not denying that anyone can legitimately make a judgement<br>
about anything.  Of course you can voice whatever reaction you've got to<br>
a thing on the spot, and that's fine.   I am saying that one's judgement<br>
won't be 'complete' (or definitive, speaking loosely) until one has *also* <br>
made an effort to get into a sympathetic frame of mind. <br>
<p>
So then you have a sort of 'triangulation', see?  You have your ordinary,<br>
everyday judgement that you would have made anyway, and you have the<br>
judgement you made when you were trying to 'verstehen' the thing.  And<br>
between them you have a pretty good idea of a) what the artist was on<br>
about, and b) what the work says in itself, just standing there. Neither<br>
of these judgements is what the work 'really' means, for there is no<br>
'really means' in art.  It's just that you have done the artist and the<br>
work the courtesy of trying to understand their side of it, so your<br>
judgement is more rounded.<br>
<p>
BTW I'm surprised to hear someone on the Extropian mailing list saying<br>
chemicals don't equate to the sense of sight! Isn't the sense of sight a<br>
chemico-optical process? Aren't we allowed to alter and possibly enhance<br>
our sense of sight by chemical means, if we will; or are we only allowed<br>
to do that after the FDA has approved the chemical?  ;-)<br>
