<i>&gt; I've been wondering: what is the absolute minimum state that could</i><br>
<i>&gt; stabilize something like David Friedman's competing private laws?</i><br>
<p>
Zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I assume that you'd need a large scale "state" to manage national</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense.  There would be serious free rider problems otherwise, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; there seem to be strong economies of scale to military coordination.</i><br>
<p>
It is likely that agencies would pool some of their resources for<br>
defense.  That would be part of their cost of service.  Free riders<br>
are likely to be a very small problem: first, because "going armadillo",<br>
i.e., not hiring a protection agency, leaves you vulnerable to all<br>
kinds of mischief.  You can enjoy the barbed wire at the border for<br>
free, but while you're doing that, some kid is stealing your stereo.<br>
If the cost of protecting your property, and your right to enforce<br>
contracts, and to redress torts is relatively small (as it would be<br>
with competing agencies--even if it includes the cost of that barbed<br>
wire fence and a missile silo or two), one is likely to pay it.<br>
Secondly, private charities would probably include the cost of basic<br>
protection with room and board, just as parents will pay for their<br>
children's protection.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; More severely, it might notice when no other law was patrolling the</i><br>
<i>&gt; customer of a competing law, and make some "accidents" happen to those</i><br>
<i>&gt; other customers.  The competing law might know it would cost it more</i><br>
<i>&gt; to compensate this with more monitoring, or retaliatory accidents, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; so be persuaded to leave the area.  Is there a contract laws could</i><br>
<i>&gt; write with each other ahead of time to assure customers that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; scenario would be very unlikely?  </i><br>
<p>
Predation is a more expensive strategy than cooperation.  It makes more<br>
sense for agencies to contract with each other for arbitration than to<br>
risk going to war.<br>
