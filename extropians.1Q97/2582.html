Well, it''s really quite simple, Greg.  The world has its ways.  We try<br>
to capture its ways in words.  If we got it right, our words are 'true',<br>
if we got it wrong, they're 'false'.  (There is of course some leeway in<br>
that words can be closer to or further away from the truth.)<br>
<p>
However, since we can't step outside ourselves to check words against<br>
reality, when we call something true that means we *conjecture* it to be<br>
true.  <br>
<p>
All our knowledge is a shot at objective truth, but has the cognitive<br>
status of conjecture.  Rational conjecture, in that we do our best to<br>
test it, but conjecture nonetheless.<br>
<p>
It never ceases to be conjecture,*even if it is true*.<br>
<p>
And much of it may well be true.<br>
<p>
That's about it.<br>
<p>
<p>
