Which certainly seems to be true for several of my smart female friends,<br>

and threw them away in the name of love.<br>

It's also interesting, as the most rabid attack on that attitude (that<br>
life is about other people) I've come across is by a woman, Celia Green;<br>
or perhaps that's because she's ranting against her genetic programming.<br>
She seems to think that it's an excuse used when leading an exceptional<br>
life becomes too hard. <br>
