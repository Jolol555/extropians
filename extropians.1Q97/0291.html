I've always wanted to learn more about her, but I've only been able to<br>

<p>
Is this based on actual public women of achievement, or on statistical<br>
data one IQ test scores? Given the established behavior of boys &amp; girls<br>
in a coeducational environment, it is to be expected that the<br>
environmental influences on the development of genius would be<br>
repressive toward women, thus influencing scores and statistical<br>
standing. If a study was done of men educated in male only schools and<br>
women educated in female only schools (for the majority of their<br>
educational careers), I would imagine that the stats would be much<br>
different. Many of the women of achievement one notices in public life<br>
tend to be graduates of womens colleges, disproportionate to the number<br>
actually in such programs.<br>
