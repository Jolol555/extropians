Actually the CD technology can store arbitrarily low frequencies; the<br>
low<br>
frequency cutoffs are in the recording gear. I have a few CDs which are<br>
very<br>
loud at subsonic frequencies because the recording engineer couldn't<br>
hear<br>
the subsonics. How do I know? I own a BodySonic chair which takes the LF<br>
component and drives the chair and ottoman, range about 5-50 HZ. I can<br>
FEEL<br>
the LF directly!<br>
<p>
Not all of the "emotional" component of music is in the LF range.<br>
<p>

<p>
I doubt there would be much appeal for low fidelity uploading. For<br>
myself, I<br>
would ask to stay in the Dewar for 10 more years....<br>
