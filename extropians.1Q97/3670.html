First I reply to:<br>
<i>&gt;On Fri, 14 Mar 1997, Joseph Strout: </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; On what basis would your upload not be you?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
 Control is a critical factor.<br>
If my brain controls my actions <br>
then a copy of my brain would control it's actions <br>
and would not be under my control.<br>
Though having an extremely similar structure to my brain.<br>
it is hardly connected to it.<br>
They evolve in the environment from differing perspectives.<br>
I could predict it's actions quite well from empathy<br>
but to say that makes it me is difficult to believe.<br>
<p>
 If destructive scanning techniques were used it may ruin my brain.<br>
My consciousness may consist of vaporized atoms.<br>
How would a bunch of vapor called U.Sov. <br>
control an electronic representation of U.Sov.?<br>
Far be it from me to suggest it can not be done,<br>
I am an optimist,<br>
but I would like to know how it could be done.<br>
Perhaps the vapor could be restructured <br>
to form the components of the representation<br>
(instantaineous phase modification?).<br>
That seems quite a chaotic idea with technology I know of.<br>
It sure would help if I knew what death was, <br>
or life either for that matter.<br>
<p>
 Wait a second.<br>
I forgot I've seen a baby with only brain stem <br>
and a child with a hemispherectomy( half a brain ) <br>
and they seemed normal.<br>
Maybe the brain is not as important as I thought.<br>
Could I still be me without a brain?<br>
Parden me while I get thrown for a loop.<br>
<p>
 What am I?<br>
Is there an organ I truly need?<br>
Is there a particle in my body which I can truly not exist without?<br>
Every moment I lose a lepton and I die.<br>
At least I am no longer what I was, <br>
yet I am alive.<br>
If I instantaneously seperated every system, organ, tissue, or cell in my body <br>
from each other,<br>
it would take another moment for each to die.<br>
If each was properly taken care of it may continue to live.<br>
I could be in a zillion+ pieces yet none of them would be dead.<br>
Could I do the same with a cell, <br>
seperate it's parts and keep them stable, <br>
waiting to be rejoined?<br>
<p>
How well do we understand the universe <br>
when we say some things are alive and some things are not. <br>
They are mostly made of simliar fundamental particles,<br>
often similar atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, systems, cultures, etc.<br>
One being may have 130 lbs of living cells and be alive.<br>
Another may 1,000 lbs of living cells with no electicity in it's brain, <br>
so obviously it is dead, <br>
right?<br>
I'm not so sure.<br>
<p>
How far have I come when I do not willingly accept simple answers <br>
to the most basic question?<br>
What am I?<br>
<p>
  U.Sov.<br>
