This seems to assume that internal value conflicts are not possible.<br>
In fact, internal value conflicts are not only fairly common, but<br>
can also be deliberately whipped up. Once you are in a state of<br>
value conflict, then you can choose which of your values to "push<br>
toward" to settle back out of that state of internal value conflict.<br>
When you start rearranging your environment (physical and social,<br>
i. e. making new friends, for instance), then you can reinforce<br>
your own decisions about which values you want to strengthen.<br>
<p>
The way you phrase your last question ignores the possiblity of<br>
metavalues, of multiple metavalues, of multiple *levels* of<br>
metavalues, and of metavalue conflicts. It also ignores the fact<br>
that we can use our control over our own environments to shape our<br>
own values at least as easily as a behaviorist psychologist could<br>
do operant conditioning on us.<br>
<p>
My wanting to eat almond croissants with coffee every morning and<br>
my wanting to have a more varied (and healthy) breakfast diet are<br>
two values of mine. I really can't make much sense of how to answer<br>
your last question from this situation. What are you really asking<br>
here? This is a pretty direct challenge to some extropian thinking:<br>
if we can't transform our own values, desires, and ideals, then in<br>
what meaningful and interesting sense is Self-Transformation<br>
possible? Your position seems to get bogged down in philosophical<br>
determinism very quickly.<br>
