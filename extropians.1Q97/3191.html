<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Creativity is often looked upon as a mysterious magical quality of </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; artists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet, the word creativity covers a wide range of skills. For example, </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Do Bono writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; "A few people, a very few people, now know that there is an absolute</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; mathematical necessity for human creativity because of the way human</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; perception works as a self-organiziang information system.  Such systems</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; demand creativity and also provocation."</i><br>
<p>
Then I wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'd quibble over words here, though I basically agree.  Learning neural </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;nets demand _feedback_.  Creativity is an artifact, not a neccesity.</i><br>
<p>
Natasha invited:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let's quibble. Please explain in what ways you deem creativity to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be an artifact.</i><br>
 <br>
Learning neural nets learn by a process of trial and error.  A new<br>
link is added, or an existing link is weighted differently, or some <br>
similar change is made.  Then the net gets feedback and judges it's new <br>
connection accordingly.  The whole process takes place with no creativity <br>
involved.  A simple exanple is on the shelf at your local software store <br>
in the section labeled 'optical character recognition'.  <br>
Thus, having an element of the set 'neural nets' without the characteristic<br>
'creativity', I feel confident in stating that neural nets don't demand<br>
creativity.<br>
But then what is one to think about the fact that creativity does arise<br>
in some neural nets, especially the more complicted ones?  So I called <br>
it an artifact.<br>
<p>
And QM requested:<br>
<i>&gt; ...define artifact</i><br>
<p>
Off the top of my head: an artifact is something that appears from a <br>
system, but is not essential to its functioning.<br>
I was surprised that some people took this term to be pejorative.  It was <br>
simply intended to be discriptive.  I readers prefer, I could substitute <br>
the phrase 'emergent behavior' without significantly changing the meaning.<br>
<p>
Natasha's pre-quibble post continued:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; {snip} Learning how to be creative requires an ability to train thought </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; patterns to take new routes. {snip}</i><br>
<p>
And my pre-quibble response continued:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;That's part of it.  Letting one's train of thought jump the tracks is </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;merely daydreaming or smoking dope.  Anyone can do that.  The essential </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;part of creativity is doing something with that meandering thought; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;getting it to alight on another - perhaps new - track.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The extreme of letting one's thoughts take new routes is insanity. ( Many</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;notable artists and musicians are known to strayed over the edge. )  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;trick is to let the thoughts loose, but not too loose.</i><br>
<p>
Whereupon QM admonished:<br>
<i>&gt;...your hypothesis that artists in general tend more toward insanity than</i><br>
<i>&gt;other groups...is not supported by any evidence... Can you tell me how</i><br>
<i>&gt;you came to this conclusion?</i><br>
<p>
Oops!  I got caught making assertions that I can't support.  How embarrasing!<br>
I guess I just tapped into our cultural mythology about artists because it <br>
seemed convenient to confirm my ideas.  But I know of no study that<br>
demonstrates the converse either.  I still suspect that it may be true.<br>
Anybody got any hard data on this, pro or con?  [ Please hurry so KA can <br>
cancel her reservations :) ]<br>
<p>
I stumbled to the conclusion mainly through my experience - both professional<br>
and recreational - with neural nets on computers.  I have seen that allowing<br>
a net to alter its pathways a little is part of its learning process, and<br>
that sometimes this results in useful but unexpected constructions that can <br>
best be labeled 'creative'.  And I have further seen that too much altering<br>
can result in behavior that can only be described as 'insane'.<br>
<p>
The whole point of this post was to try to get a grip on the mechanism <br>
of creativity, not to offend artists.  I'll do some more thinking<br>
and post more on it later.<br>
