<i> &gt;Buddhists are particularly apt at indifference. Their religion</i><br>

<p>
Just as people who are familiar only with the teachings of the<br>
Catholic Church should refrain from making generalizations about<br>
all of Christianity, so people who are familiar only with the<br>
teachings of Theravada Buddhism should refrain from making<br>
generalizations about all of Buddhist dharma. The boddhisattva<br>
ideal is an immortalist ideal, seeking permanent reincarnation<br>
until all of existence has been made conscious and achieved the<br>
ecstasy of enlightenment (which is, according to Mahayana teachings,<br>
not a final space in which one "arrives", but capable of boundless<br>
expansion and self-transformation). I happen to think the Four Vows<br>
of Mahayana Buddhism are entirely compatible with extropian values,<br>
but that's just my personal opinion.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, the emotional state which Mahayana Buddhists generally<br>
develop as their central mood can better be described as "detached<br>
compassion" than as "indifference". Zen Buddhism is rather Apollonian<br>
in this way, and I do like some of the Dionysiac stuff that is<br>
mostly missing from it, but I think your criticism of the Apollonian<br>
aspects goes a little too far.<br>
