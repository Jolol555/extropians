<i>&gt; &gt; Murder?  This is several links away from responsibility.  He never</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; claimed that it had come to pick up people, nor did he claim that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one could be picked up via suicide.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And even if he had, the cult members still have a choice.  The worst</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possible crime here is fraud.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fraud is a felony, is it not? If so, the law in California clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; states that any deaths occuring during the the commission of a felony</i><br>
<i>&gt; are to considered homicides. Ergo, charge the bastard with murder.</i><br>

Actually, there were probably a great number of deaths world wide that<br>
occured during the commission of said felony.  Of course, I do not think<br>
any court would convict him of murder of someone on the other side of the<br>
globe who happened to choke on their food while he was talking.  Besides,<br>
the felony was over and done with by the time the cultists killed<br>
themselves.<br>
