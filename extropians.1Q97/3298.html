Hey there,<br>
  I'm working on writing an extropian sci-fi story.  I've got just a few<br>
ideas written down now.  now, my biggest worry, is a thing I have<br>
involving destructors.  Would it somehow be possible for a universal<br>
destructor to be created, that could basically eat the whole universe,<br>
and of course, destroy it?  I know that eventually, the mass contained<br>
in this destructor would cause it to implode or something to that<br>
matter.(I'm just not having a very high brain active day today... urgh. <br>
The words aren't coming out right... Oh well...)  Anwyays, is it<br>
feasible to have an army of destructors destroy the universe, and create<br>
a singularity(by having the mass concentrated so densely) similar to the<br>
one in the origin of the big bang?  If not, is there a way I could<br>
destroy the universe/speed up things to the "big crunch"...  I need to<br>
do this in the story, and the destructors are an idea I like, but I<br>
don't know if it's technically possible.  But then again, I suppose I<br>
could do like Star Trek, and if it doesn't fit the physics we know, just<br>
make it up!  I could use any help on this matter.  I've read Physics of<br>
Immortality and that has a little helpful info.  Also Engines of<br>
Creation is a start, but I need to learn more on something like this. <br>
thanks!<br>
<p>
Peace,<br>
