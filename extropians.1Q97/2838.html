Another area where people feel they know more than the professionals<br>
is sports.  People involved in professional sports seem to have all<br>
their decisions second guessed and vociferously criticized, from hiring<br>
and salary decisions down to the selection of when to pass versus run<br>
the ball.  And the fans seem very confident about their criticisms even<br>
though most of them have never run or coached a professional team.<br>
<p>
What do professional sports have in common with politics?<br>
