Got this from the website of Bill Beatty. I figured Gene, Anders, James,<br>
and the rest of the pyros on the list would get a kick. The Dale T.<br>
mentioned below is my freind Dale Travous, who I've referred to in the<br>
past re the railgun we tested.<br>
<p>
<p>
THE "WATERGUN"<br>
<p>
by Bill Beaty, experiment by Dan Y. and Dale T.<br>
<p>
The capacitor discharge gun was a 6" cylinder of mild steel, 2" <br>
diameter with a 1/2" hole bored most of the way through axially.  <br>
At the base, two holes were bored in from the sides and threaded <br>
to take standard sparkplugs.  The gun was fired at up to 40KV <br>
from a bank of six 3uF capacitors (about 1/2 cubic yard in size!) <br>
using 1-1/2" x 1/2" copper busbar as conductors.  The switching<br>
gap was a pair of metal spheres between which a short length of metal<br>
rod was inserted using air pressure.  About one cm^3 of water was <br>
placed in the gun, and a steel ballbearing was initially used as <br>
the projectile.<br>
<p>
In the initial tries, the sparkplugs blew out violently from the<br>
gun, and the ballbearing was gently lofted from the barrel.  We assume <br>
that the force originates in the discharge gap, and so we need to <br>
position the gap closer to the base of the barrel.<br>
<p>
The sparkplugs were replaced with turned teflon rods and copper wire<br>
conductors, with the single discharge gap centered in the barrel.  The<br>
ball bearing was replaced with a black polyethelene cylinder with flat<br>
ends, which gave a slip-fit into the bore.  A clay cube of about 10" to<br>
12" thick (water based modeling clay) was used as a target.  When fired,<br>
the<br>
teflon rods and the copper conductors were still blown out of the holes. <br>
But this time the slug went through the entire clay block, leaving a<br>
large<br>
entrance hole and a tiny exit hole.  The entrance hole was conical, with<br>
ripples and spirals on the walls.  Amazingly, the projectle had not the<br>
slightest bit of damage, and the edges of the beveled end were even<br>
still<br>
sharp and polished.  Even more amazing, after going through the entire<br>
block of clay, the slug was stopped by the thin poly bag that covered<br>
the<br>
back of the clay block.<br>
<p>
<p>
5/95 - In the spring issue of ELECTRIC SPACECRAFT JOURNAL, the Richmond <br>
Virginia Tesla Coil Builders Assn. have an article on their own watergun <br>
experiments.  They manage to perforate a 1/4" aluminum plate with<br>
nothing <br>
but the water fired from the end of the gun.  They attempt to look <br>
for anomalous energy production, but their results are inconclusive.<br>

SOME CAPACITOR EXPERIMENT RESULTS,                          7/10/94<br>
or,  Blowing Stuff Up: a "guy thing"<br>
<p>
We tried discharging through small pieces of agar gel with various<br>
electrode<br>
lengths and spacing.  Capacitor bank: three 100uF, 30KV units in<br>
parallel.  <br>
Switching gap: two 1-1/2" brass spheres moved by an AC solenoid, with<br>
flexible contact made via several flat 1" ground braids.   8" lengths of <br>
heavy solid copper wire (#12?) were run from the capacitor terminals and <br>
were bent to form a gap, into which small blocks of agar were placed.  A <br>
styrene cottage cheese bowl was placed below the gap to shield the<br>
capacitor <br>
conductors from agar splatter.  A 12" Tupperware bowl was placed over <br>
the gap to shield the rest of the room from flying agar.<br>
<p>
At low voltage (under 2KV) there was no explosion.  Instead, the agar<br>
glowed <br>
yellow, sputtered, and melted adjacent to one electrode wire.  This is <br>
similar to the "glowing 120V pickel" demo, where an arc burns pickel<br>
flesh <br>
from around an electrode with a crawling arc which sequentially attacks <br>
the material closest to the electrode.<br>
<p>
With electrodes inserted 1/2" into the agar at 1" spacing and 2.5KV,<br>
there <br>
was an extremely loud blast which shattered the styrene cottage cheese<br>
bowl <br>
we had placed below the wires in an attempt to shield the conductors<br>
from<br>
agar splatter.  But even with a blast like a shotgun discharge, the agar <br>
simply broke into several pieces and fell from the electrodes.  The <br>
explosion was all sound, but with very little mechanical force.<br>
<p>
With 1/2" electrodes at 1/4" spacing, the blast was extremely loud, the<br>
agar was thrown out from the discharge as a liquid spray, the cottage<br>
cheese bowl was again shattered and blown downwards, and the 10"<br>
tupperware bowl that covered the assembly was shattered!  Bill thinks it<br>
happened not only from overpressure, but from fast risetime of force<br>
which<br>
shattered the plastic like sillyputty with a hammer.  Because the agar<br>
was<br>
splattered on this run, we suspect that the voltage and spacing in the<br>
previous run must have been just at the explosion-producing threshold. <br>
Also note that the explosion energy seems to be nonlinear with respect<br>
to<br>
e-field, and with respect to total input energy since reducing the gap<br>
while keeping capacitor voltage and capacitance constant seems to have<br>
enormously raised the energy output.  Perhaps energy is proportional to<br>
peak current? Or perhaps there is a threshold in voltage or current<br>
below<br>
which explosion energy falls rapidly. <br>
<p>
Since the discharge is intensely loud, Bill suspects that the extremely<br>
loud noise from the quartershrinker^* setup may be coming from the <br>
switching gap, and not from the exploding coil.  After all, covering the <br>
quarter with the iron pipe did not reduce the noise all that much.  Dr. <br>
P. Graneau has written about anomolies with high current air arcs, <br>
pointing out in particular that the sound from lightning may not simply <br>
be from thermal transient air expansion, but from unexplored plasma <br>
dynamics which produce shock waves via motor effects.  Perhaps this is <br>
the source of the intense sound from the discharge.<br>

THese guys have FUN to say the least. Dale has apparently gotten quite a<br>
bit of attention from Hollywood recently, through his past performance<br>
at MIcrosoft's Halloween party in 1995, and is pretty busy doing what he<br>
enjoys the most.<br>
