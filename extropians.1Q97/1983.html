<i>&gt;ever had.</i><br>
<p>
I elided the PC equivalent for space reasons: "The document could not be<br>
printed because of a problem with the printer setup."  Notice the two are<br>
equivalent in stupidity, but the Mac version is more graphical.  Actually<br>
the fascination of watching the Mac tell me I should type *there* where<br>
there was no entry blank, kinda made up for the stupidity, while the<br>
PC error just made me mad.  I think the PC is more sly because it still<br>
leaves the impression that *I* am missing something.<br>
<p>
You're right, the PC now has three semi-working Finders (File Manager,<br>
Explorer, "My Computer") where the Mac has only one working one,<br>
and three halves is *more* than one.<br>
<p>
Anyway part of my point was that more bad intelligence is worse, not better.<br>
Word 6 has more bad intelligence than Word 5, to compare, well I guess<br>
oranges.<br>
