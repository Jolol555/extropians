I think you're proving one of Mr. Clark's points, that values are<br>
observer-dependent.  A CD-ROM is not an observer, and so a "value" solely on<br>
a CD-ROM does, indeed, mean nothing.  Simarily, a "value" floating in some<br>
Platonic ether wouldn't mean anything either.  Only in a person (or some<br>
presently hypothetical alternative such as an AI or alien) does a value take<br>
on a meaning.<br>
<p>
Naturally, *professing* a value is different from *having* a value.  You have<br>
a value if your actions reflect it.<br>

<p>
This is Dennett's position, that free will is an way to interpret extremely<br>
complicated entities, rather than an actual property of such entities.<br>
 Current conventional wisdom holds that complex entities always seem<br>
free-willed to themselves, because no entity possessing complexity equivalent<br>
to that of arithmetic can completely explain itself.  "Free will" is a factor<br>
of the amount unexplained, not of the amount explained.<br>
<p>
How to handle the situation where an entity sees itself as free-willed but<br>
another can fully predict it is very messy.  Adequately understanding it<br>
probably requires concepts far beyond those available to people as we don't<br>
seem able to manage that amount of knowledge.  At present it's entirely<br>
hypothetical.<br>
