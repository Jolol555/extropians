Well, for starters, it would really be much cheaper to send out a probe<br>
with a database of a couple thousand or even million uploads, possibly<br>
living a virtual community along the way, along with genomic data and <br>
invitro/artificial womb equipment (or just some nanites to build it) to<br>
another star for colonization and animation of made to order people.<br>
(See "Just Peace")<br>
<p>
One of the reasons I think so many people are getting introverted and<br>
virtual, is the encroaching population and societal pressures of our<br>
current world. If you colonize a new planet, I think that the group<br>
dynamic will change such that living virtually will lose some of its<br>
appeal, as you have a whole real world to explore and conquer.<br>
<p>
I myself am not sure if I want to upload until I've had a fairly good<br>
view of the rest of the universe first, so I really would like to do    <br>
my explorations in the flesh first. Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm getting<br>
primitive again, what the hell. Hell, I want to check out 47 Ursa<br>
Majoris, Lalande 21, and Proxima Centauri (there are unconfirmed reports<br>
of planets there) at the very least, make a bundle on all that real<br>
estate, or if they are inhabited, on technology and cultural exchanges.<br>
Then I could afford to build myself into a Jupiter Brain MWAHAHAHA!<br>
