Gregory Houston writes a long piece on developing his "natural" mental<br>
abilities in a scientific fashion, as an alternative to exploring the<br>
"objective" world.  This is interesting to me as someone who spent many of<br>
his younger years studying Asian ideas, cultures and history.  He writes: <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Whos to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  say that if we had not spent the last 500 years focusing on internal</i><br>
<i>&gt;  augmentation rather than or in combination with external augmentation</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that we would not have discovered by now how to do for ourselves what we</i><br>
<i>&gt;  now require external objects for?" </i><br>
<p>
and <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Stripped of religious idealogy, I believe a subjective science could be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  created that would eventually surpass or at the least, seriously</i><br>
<i>&gt;  augment, objective science in its usefulness, but we are lazy.</i><br>
<p>
As a matter of historical fact, I think the answer to the first question lies<br>
in the predicate to the second statement, as illumnated by Joseph Needham's<br>
magnum opus "Science and Civilization in China".  Years ago, Needham asked<br>
himself the question, "Why didn't China, with its highly developed<br>
civilization, never have an industrial revolution?"  He died still writing<br>
one volume after another of answers to this question.<br>
<p>
In his piece, Gregory basically descibes the goals, disciplines and<br>
techniques of "yoga", classical Taoism and Hinayana Buddhism in its various<br>
forms, including Zen.  Anyone who makes even a superficial -- but open minded<br>
-- study of these subjects can't help but be impressed by the deep insights<br>
into the nature of consciousness and powerful tools for effective living<br>
developed by their purest devotees.<br>
<p>
The problem, and the reason why these philosophies and disciplines were<br>
ultimately dead ends up until now, was the very lack of objectively correct<br>
connection with the external world possessed in the great minds who developed<br>
them.  Crippled by only the most primitive understanding of "objective<br>
reality", most of these yogis and masters were unable to avoid a slide from<br>
insight into and development of their own "software" and "operating systems"<br>
into completely misguided beliefs and assertions about "objective reality"<br>
and metaphysics. The very best of them -- who surely rank with Einstein and<br>
Newton as amongst the greatest minds produced by the "natural" human race --<br>
realized their ignorance about objective reality and tried to avoid such<br>
explorations and assertions.  But, in doing so, they were cut off from some<br>
of the most important truths and tools their other accomplishments could have<br>
built on.  If only Gautama had known a little basic physics or biology!  If<br>
only Lao T'zu had had a basic chemistry lab at his disposal.  We'd probably<br>
all be speaking Hindi or Mandarin now.<br>
<p>
But they didn't and we don't and there's a reason.  The reason is that their<br>
civilizations did not have within them the seeds to generate the scientific<br>
method, those seeds being a foundation of individual liberty and the<br>
associated social structures of a free market that ruthlessly disciplines<br>
refusal to understand and come to terms with "objective reality".  It is with<br>
deep sympathy that one perceives the mental and social contortions the great<br>
Asian thinkers went through to deal with this cultural handicap.  The Buddha<br>
raised conceptual walls against metaphysical speculation that most of his<br>
followers ignored.  Lao T'zu founded a tradition of eccentric hermeticism to<br>
avoid the stifling social bonds and restrictions of Confucianism.  But in<br>
doing these things, the great Asian thinkers crippled the power of their own<br>
insights.<br>
<p>
Only in the West, with its cultural roots in the Agora of Athens and the<br>
Roman virtues of civitas, could the power of human technological engagement<br>
with "objective reality" be unleashed.  Only in the European bourgoise<br>
societies of the Renaissance could that power be limitlessly amplified<br>
through the feedback mechanism of the scientific method.  Has the West, with<br>
its ignorance of "the inner path", been somehow fundamentally poorer because<br>
of its focus on the "outer" world?  In a sense, yes.  But, as the "goals,<br>
disciplines and techniques" of extropianism highlight, it may also have been<br>
the only way to give birth to possibilities that are literally infinitely<br>
richer.  <br>
<p>
Is it time to look back to the "wisdom of the East" and look inward to<br>
untapped riches within?  As visionaries like Huxley and Leary foresaw, I<br>
think the answer is a resounding yes.  However, we must seek a new synthesis<br>
that vigilantly guards against the unfortunate -- but as I point out above,<br>
inevitable -- errors of the traditional wisdom of the East.<br>
