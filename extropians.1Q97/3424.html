This number was determined fairly precisely last year by Smalley's group at<br>
Rice.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the number on line given a few minutes<br>
of search.  I did find an estimate of 1000 GPa in a paper from the group<br>
that apparently predates the more precise measurement:<br>

Young's modulus is usually 30 to 100 times larger than the breaking strength<br>
of a material.  This is equivalent to saying most materials can be stretched<br>
by 1% to 3% before they snap.  Obviously, it's bigger for rubber-- more like<br>
100%.  But strong materials tend to be at the low end of the range. This is<br>
annoying, because the larger this percentage, the less susceptible the<br>
material is to crack propagation.  That's why glass cracks easier than<br>
rubber, even though glass is much stronger and stiffer.  <br>
<p>
Buckytubes put under stress tend to unravel into one-atom-thick carbyne<br>
strings, which are stronger than the original tube, but also chemically<br>
reactive (<a href="http://cnst.rice.edu/images/tube1.gif">http://cnst.rice.edu/images/tube1.gif</a>).  It would be cool if<br>
streching a rope made of buckytube would convert it into something even<br>
stronger!  Probably won't work, though-- carbyne strands will react with one<br>
another.  Even if a stretched fiber turns into a chunk of amorphous carbon,<br>
that would be great, because that's fairly strong stuff, and it's a lot<br>
easier doing engineering with a material that retains *some* of its strength<br>
when its limits are exceeded.<br>
