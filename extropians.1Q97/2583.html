<i>&gt; I simply repeated the sum total context of your post,</i><br>
<i>&gt; namely, "I have no desire to attain truth."  Once you have said this,</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything else you post must be viewed as untruthful, hence, contextless.</i><br>
<p>
Your argument is that if I deny truth then I am embracing what is false.<br>
This is not the case. This is the same sort of thinking that says if I<br>
deny God, then I embrace satan. Neither are *useful* statements to me.<br>
When I deny one pole of a dichotomy, I do not embrace its opposite. I<br>
deny the dichotomy entirely. I am replacing truth with something that<br>
can serve all it functions while shifting some of the priority from<br>
epistemology to axiology and the emotive. This is a shift from the <br>
true-false continuum to a useful-unuseful or functional-nonfunctional<br>
continuum. It is a shift in priorities.<br>
<p>
Then what about honesty you might say? I can be honest without ever<br>
having to refer to the concept of truth, because we have found that<br>
"honesty is the best policy." In the long run, it is not useful for me<br>
to give people unuseful information. This is honesty qua usefulness<br>
rather than honesty qua truth. It still works. Queerly enough, if people<br>
took on this new definition of honesty, we might not be bombarded by so<br>
much trivial and useless information. People might aspire to more useful<br>
dialogue rather than merely truthful dialogue. A person can speak the<br>
truth and still lose control of their emotions thus severly inhibiting<br>
the depth of the discussion. But if the individual was instead concerned<br>
with usefulnes, that individual would not find it useful to lose control<br>
of their emotions. Thus that individual could offer the same information<br>
as the former, while going much further in the argument without losing<br>
emotive control. The person whose focus is on truth cannot be nearly as<br>
honest as the person whose focus is on usefulness. This is because a<br>
focus on truth entails a focus on knowledge and is thus limited to that<br>
which is conscious. But a focus on usefulness entails a focus on the<br>
emotions need and desire [something is only useful if we need or desire<br>
it]. This person is going to want to first find the subconscious sources<br>
of his needs and desires and then attempt to make those forces<br>
conscious. The person with a focus on usefulness is then going to have<br>
fewer unconscious forces determining that person's interaction with<br>
others, while the person with a focus on truth is going to continue to<br>
interact with people dishonestly because that person still has<br>
underlying motivations which that person is unaware of. No one can be<br>
absolutely honest, but by degree, the person focused on usefulness, will<br>
be more honest, more free, more in control of self--emotively and thus<br>
cognitively--than the person focused on truth.   <br>
<p>
Does usefulness rule out pure or base science? Of course not. We have<br>
found pure and base science to be often useful in enabling future<br>
technologies.<br>
<p>
Just scenario-spinning: hypothetically, what would be the difference<br>
between a person who spent ten years meditating on truth, and another<br>
person who spent ten years meditating on usefulness? Truth certainly<br>
*sounds* much loftier.<br>
<p>
Now lets imagine that the first individual spent the next ten years<br>
applying truth to science, and the other individual spent the next ten<br>
years applying usefulness to science.  <br>
<p>
<p>
The following are what I hypothesize would be some of the differences<br>
between these two individuals:<br>
1. Using a greater portion of his/her consciousness, the individual<br>
focused on usefulness would be more effective [useful] as a scientist<br>
than the person focused on truth. This person would, having greater<br>
control over his/her emotions, have a greater ability to rationalize,<br>
pancritically or otherwise.<br>
2. Though the person focused on truth can rationalize violence as<br>
irrational, that person is more likely to be violent and to participate<br>
in the creation of violent technology because that person does not have<br>
the same control over his/her emotions as the person focused on<br>
usefulness. A kleptomaniac might come to the realization that what he is<br>
doing is *wrong* and that he would like to stop, but in that same<br>
instance he steals something because he has not delved into his<br>
subconscious in order to truly take responsibility for his emotive<br>
drives. He may have the cognitive and rational skill to realize his<br>
problem, but not the emotive capacity to truly deal with it. Based on<br>
the same argument, a person who holds truth as a higher priority than<br>
usefulness is more likely to be a Charlaten,<br>
saying/thinking/rationalizaing one thing while feeling and doing yet<br>
another. Severing emotion from cognition severs the individual.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sidhartha was focused on truth. He came to the realization that "Life is<br>
suffering." What if Sidhartha had been focused on usefulness? Would he<br>
have came to the realization that "Life is unuseful." I cannot say for<br>
sure, but I doubt it. Its easy to associate suffering with a general<br>
concept as life, but it becomes a bit more difficult to associate<br>
something like unuseful to a general concept like life. If life isn't<br>
useful, its our own fault. Its not the fault of life. If I am bored and<br>
useless its my own fault.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;Science is fundamentally driven by need and desire. We need to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; predict such and such to survive. I desire to predict such and such in</i><br>
<i>&gt; order to survive forever.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a rich hoard of historical literature, much of it</i><br>
<i>&gt; autobiographical, about scientists (and natural philosophers) being</i><br>
<i>&gt; motivated by the pure search for knowledge itself, completely unconnected</i><br>
<i>&gt; to any animal desire for survival.  Perhaps they all were lying about this.</i><br>
<p>
No, I was using survival as merely an example of a desire. You simply<br>
have offered yet another example. Thank you, there are probably hundreds<br>
of desires which motivate science. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;Science is a tool of need and desire. It is an emotive tool, yet it denies</i><br>
<i>&gt; the emotions.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is clearly untrue, scientists undeniably squeal like stuck pigs when</i><br>
<i>&gt; their government funding is cut.  They get quite emotional about it.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you again. One more example of where it might be beneficial<br>
[useful] for scientists to gain greater control over their emotions.<br>
Instead of "squealing" they might speak with emotive passion and<br>
charisma. Instead of waisting hours, perhaps days and weeks, being<br>
pissed off, they might be using that time *usefully* working on an<br>
appeal or seeking funding elsewhere.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;We cannot even prove that absolute truth exists.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who is this "we"?  Perhaps you need to broaden your circle of associates.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, perhaps so. Do you know someone who can prove absolute truth exists?<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;It would not even matter if in some freakish sense that I myself did not</i><br>
<i>&gt; "truely" exist.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This appears to be an agreeable statement.</i><br>
<p>
Was that a momentary lapse of emotive control? It does not appear to be<br>
a useful reply and in terms of truth it is certainly relative to your<br>
own opinion. You have once again taken a statement out of context and<br>
thus shifted its meaning. <br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think you mean that a hundred years ago people said "God is dead."  Then</i><br>
<i>&gt; came the filthy French compost-modernists who pretended that truth died</i><br>
<i>&gt; with him.  Then came the inability for my children to go out in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; neighborhood without constant adult supervision for fear of the barbaric</i><br>
<i>&gt; perverts who grew up inculcated with your religious beliefs.</i><br>
<p>
Wow, there is a leap in your argument that I am unable to follow. How<br>
did we get from the French compost-modernists to my religious beliefs<br>
and then to your paranoia of people molesting your children. A little<br>
more elaboration might be appropriate here. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;How can you be absolutely honest with others when you cannot even by</i><br>
<i>&gt; honest with yourself. You do not know yourself well enough. You are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; aware enough of whats going on subconsciously to imagine that you are being</i><br>
<i>&gt; truthful.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do not make the mistake that because you are confused, that others are</i><br>
<i>&gt; similarly confused.</i><br>
<p>
This is much less a matter of confusion than a matter of unawareness. I<br>
think your focus on epistemology probably guided you to that conclusion.<br>
Confusion has to do with knowledge, but what I am speaking about in this<br>
example is about subconscious emotions that *we* are unaware of. Did you<br>
deny that you have a subconscious? Are you completely aware of all that<br>
motivates you? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is an invalid deduction.  Certainly, since you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have once again repeated that "I have no desire to attain truth," we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; all see that you have no intention whatsoever of being honest, even if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; weren't internally confused.</i><br>
<p>
This was sufficiently dealt with at the beginning of this Email. My<br>
priorities do not restrict honesty and clarity of thought. They actaully<br>
enhance them.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;The concept of "truth" is not even compatible with Pancritical</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rationalism.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This topic came up on the list in March 1994.  At that time, I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; concerned, based on the positions that some individuals were taking on PCR,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that your statement above was quite probably true.  However, this point,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for me, was cleared up by Max More when he wrote:</i><br>
[SNIP]<br>
<p>
I will grant you that and am proved corrected. This does not however<br>
attentuate my argument for a shift in priority. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Recently, I ran across an analysis of this same point by the philosopher</i><br>
<i>&gt; Etienne Gilson who concluded (rightly) that: "You must either begin as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; realist with being, in which case you will have a knowledge of being, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; begin as a critical idealist with knowledge, in which case you will never</i><br>
<i>&gt; come in contact with being."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What Gilson refers to as the "critical idealist" I was referring to as the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "smug nihilist."  Being and truth are, of course, different aspects of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same ontological primitive.</i><br>
<p>
If so then is truth as static as being? I'm not interested in platonic<br>
primitives. I'll take becoming and usefulness over the concepts of being<br>
and truth. The latter concepts and the priorities they entail create a<br>
shift from the static to the dynamic, moving and changing, from the<br>
absolute to the relative. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; So really, Max and myself are saying the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing, that unless you begin with a care for truth, you will never have</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge.  You cannot begin with knowledge itself and get anywhere at all,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you must begin with caring for truth.</i><br>
<p>
This argument is difficult for me. You first say that I have to care for<br>
truth to have knowledge, but then you say if I start with knowlegde I<br>
won't get anywhere. How did I get the knowledge in the latter example if<br>
I did not first care for truth? It doesn't really matter ...<br>
<p>
Knowledge is limited to things we can think. I am intrested in a MUCH<br>
BROADER spectrum of consciousness which includes emotions. I will call<br>
this broader spectrum "information". I do not feel the term information<br>
limits me to the purely cognitive that epistemology does. When you are<br>
focused on truth and knowledge alone, you deny the greater portion of<br>
your consciousness. Its like looking through a little peep hole on<br>
reality without ever feeling its presence.<br>
<p>
<p>
Shifts and expansions in priority:<br>
<p>
Epistemology --&gt; Axiology and Aesthetics<br>
Truth        --&gt; Usefulness/functionality<br>
False        --&gt; Unuseful/nonfuntional<br>
Knowlege     --&gt; Information (the entire continuum of<br>
consciousness,                     including the subconscious and the<br>
emotions)<br>
Honesty      --&gt; Honesty (in terms of usefulness rather than truth)<br>
Objectivity  --&gt; The objective-subjective continuum<br>
Exogenous reality --&gt; The exogenous-endogenous reality continuum<br>
<p>
<p>
I particularly appreciate your criticism and our discussion in general<br>
Reilly. It helps me greatly to refine, modify, and more effectively<br>
express my own thoughts on this matter. Thank you. I am finding our<br>
dialogue extremely useful. <br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
