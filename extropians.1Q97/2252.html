I don't think there is any meaning to life.  IMO to ask for the meaning of<br>
life is like saying "what is the meaning of this shoelace?". It does'nt<br>
have a meaning, it only has a purpose. I think extropians should not be<br>
concerned with finding the meaning to life. There isn't one. We are here<br>
and that is that. Understanding the mechanisms by which we got to here and<br>
deciding where we are going is tough enough without assuming there is a<br>
*meaning* to it all. I think our duty is, however, to create the noblest<br>
and greatest *purpose* we can, and to follow it!<br>
