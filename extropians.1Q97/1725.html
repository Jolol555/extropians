Systems can be mutable without changing the components much.  And where<br>
did I say 'freely'?  Each person could change their own immune system,<br>
certainly.  Not the same.<br>

Anyway, I'm not particularly scare of gray goo.  Possibly some<br>
unrestricted disassembler could chomp the biosphere, but I don't take<br>
even that as given.  And if we have nanimmune systems of our own, I see<br>
no reason to believe one species could take over the nanosphere any more<br>
than one species has taken over the biosphere.  (Besides us, but we're<br>
intelligent.)<br>

Not exist in oxygen?  That probably isn't hard.  Tiny, energetic, carbon<br>
particles.  Yumm.<br>
