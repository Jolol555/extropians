recent replies suggest the possibility of your posting relying on facts.<br>
<p>
I assumed you posting was exaggerated and i have never witnessed any<br>
indications for possible malnutricion caused by poverty in the uk myself. <br>
<p>
The only indications of true poverty i have witnessed there were crack<br>
related, and go a few years back. I usually stay in london in the east end<br>
with friends that are like me: not wealthy. However it has been some time<br>
since i last been there.<br>
<p>
2 million seemed a also little steep<br>
<p>
however if your post is based on fact, i apologize for my tasteless reply.<br>
