That's interesting, David.  I have occasionally thought about the<br>
"patterns" in a little different formalism, as follows:<br>
<p>
There are some physical operations we perform on bags of objects --<br>
well, on groups of whatever kind, but a "bag" is a nice tangible thing<br>
to think about.  One such is "bag-count" -- which is a procedure that<br>
maps bags of objects onto the nonnegative integers; let me show you<br>
with this bag of oranges, I just count them out, one... two... three...<br>
<p>
Another is "bag-union" -- you see, here I have two bags of oranges,<br>
and another bag which is empty of oranges (its count is zero), and<br>
what I do is put each of the non-empty bags into the one that started<br>
empty.<br>
<p>
And now we can take data, and when we do, we find that the non-negative<br>
integers appear to provide a useful mathematical description of the<br>
properties of bags of objects, and in particular, that if A and B are<br>
bags of objects, we have:<br>
<p>
  bag-count( bag-union( A, B ) ) = bag-count( A ) + bag-count( B ).<br>
<p>
And incidentally, it doesn't matter what order you take the bags in:<br>
  <br>
  bag-count( bag-union( A, B ) ) = bag-count( bag-union( B, A ) )<br>
<p>
The way I think about it is, that these empirical properties of<br>
bag-count and bag-union -- long since elevated to the status of<br>
physical laws (except for things like raindrops and bunny rabbits),<br>
are what make the counting numbers, and perhaps most of analysis as we<br>
know it, of interest to persons who deal with the physical world.  The<br>
experiments with bag-count and bag-union are perhaps the fundamental<br>
experiments in mathematical physics.  If the count of the union were<br>
not the sum of the counts, but some other function thereof, then<br>
although mathematicians might have thought up the Peano postulates and<br>
developed analysis in the abstract, "one, two, three..." might not be<br>
something that every toddler learns.<br>
<p>
One approach to a "1+1=3" world might be substituting some different<br>
function of bag_count( A ) and bag_count( B ), than their sum, in the<br>
above.<br>
<p>
It is interesting that folklore and fantasy provide several examples<br>
of instances of failure of this law, notably the never-ending penny.<br>
