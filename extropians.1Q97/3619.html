<i>&gt; From: Mark Grant </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Most likely you'd want the equivalent of a Web 'nymserver', such that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; could create a URL like '<a href="http://www.nymserver/cool-illegal-page.html'">http://www.nymserver/cool-illegal-page.html'</a> and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the nymserver would read the full encrypted URL from a database. This</i><br>
<i>&gt; would also allow you to mirror pages easily, and could be used as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; justification for the site. You could sell it as a server allowing people</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; to move their pages around but keep a fixed URL, and the 'remailed' URLs </i><br>
<i>&gt; would just be a special case.</i><br>
<p>
Well i have an idea on how to use this kind of technology for something<br>
usefull and legal.<br>
<p>
It would be perfect way to fight back on organised crime. The mob in the<br>
US. Here in Denmark it is generally recognized that a very well known biker<br>
gang controls the drug traffic. Currently we are in the middle of a War<br>
between the two leading bikergangs. Being fought with submachine guns and<br>
anti panser rocket. (Even aginst jailed members.)<br>
<p>
Most people don't dare to wittnes against these gangs. For the same reason<br>
i don't think anybody would be very willing to put anti-crime gang info on<br>
their private homepages.<br>
<p>
It could be nice to have a website perhaps with a list of all the crimes<br>
that these gangs have committed, just to remind us. Also other kind of<br>
information like reports on people they have hurt, but who hasn't dared to<br>
report the incidents, could be on the server.<br>
<p>
I'm pretty shure theres a lot of information that can be put on the web to<br>
inform against organised crime, and expose these people.<br>
