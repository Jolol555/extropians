So what? The question under discussion in the paragraph you are<br>
responding to was whether or not Lenin's Russia was a political<br>
system that "worked". Are you still claiming that it was?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;nearly everything a person x does or doesn't do, will have an effect on</i><br>

<i> &gt;ignorance.</i><br>
<p>
This is precisely the sort of question that led to the old list<br>
rule against arguing the basics. (Please see the discussion of this<br>
question in the FAQ at <a href="http://www.pobox.com/~arkuat/extr/faq/topics.html">http://www.pobox.com/~arkuat/extr/faq/topics.html</a>)<br>
There are whole books on anarchocapitalist and classical-liberal<br>
theory, and it is unreasonable of you to ask me to regurgitate them<br>
for you on a mere mailing list. You could go for the radical, such<br>
as David Friedman's THE MACHINERY OF FREEDOM, or the moderate such<br>
as Friedrich Hayek's THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY. There are other<br>
books as well.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;There are problems involving commons,</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;externalities, and public goods, and some of these are severe</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;problems for local governments. But nearly all such things should</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;be handled by local governments, yet most tax funds in my country</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;go to the Federal government or to fulfilling Federal government</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;mandates. </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Aha, so you're not an anarchist, just a separatist ? The independant state</i><br>
<i> &gt;of southern California ? In our private mail we discussed your (and my)</i><br>
<i> &gt;ideal for an independant chunk of rock orbiting sol, for you and your</i><br>
<i> &gt;friends to build your own way of life. Does this involve cutting off</i><br>
<i> &gt;relations with the rest of humanity ? I'm sorry but this makes the</i><br>
<i> &gt;extropian ideal of space colonization look like a disguised form of</i><br>
<i> &gt;isolationism, instead of expansion. How 'entropic' ?  </i><br>
<p>
Who said anything about isolationism? I believe in free trade and<br>
free migration, open borders. If you want to continue this discussion,<br>
you might want to be a little more cautious about jumping to<br>
conclusions that misrepresent my positions, or I will cut and run<br>
with a clear conscience. There is no point in trying to have political<br>
discussions with people who have no idea what one another are talking<br>
about.<br>
<p>
I don't live in Southern California, because the weather down there<br>
drives me crazy. I live in the Bay Area up north, where it is nice<br>
and foggy, just the way I like it. And I promise I won't mix up<br>
Antwerp with Brussels, okay? You live in Brussels, which is central,<br>
and most of the people there speak French, but the surrounding<br>
countryside speaks Flemish, right? (If I got this wrong, it's because<br>
I'm relying on my memory and not a reference book.)<br>
<p>
I think that the best practical path to world anarchy from where<br>
we are now is goes *through* and *past* devolution of power from<br>
imperial bodies to local governments, but I am a political<br>
opportunist...  I'll take whatever path I can get. I don't pretend<br>
to be anything but utterly ignorant about the future evolution of<br>
our culture, including our political culture. Perhaps you are<br>
confusing me with a constructivist-rationalist (this is a term from<br>
Hayek). I am, instead, a critical rationalist.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;Are you saying that if someone chooses to engage in</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;"counterproductivity" on their own time and with their own stuff,</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;that the State should step in and "correct" them? Please be more</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;specific if this is not what you mean.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;In extreme cases yes. What is the Anarcho Capitalist view on patents for</i><br>
<i> &gt;example ? I can imagine situations where ones 'ownership' of technological</i><br>
<i> &gt;processes, genetic codes etc, limits free trade and the freedom of the</i><br>
<i> &gt;individual, can't you ? </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;example: person A owns sythesised Gen X, he uses it for his product M in</i><br>
<i> &gt;bioindustry. Gen X can also be used to enhance certain chemical processes</i><br>
<i> &gt;in the human body. Person A has no intention of making it available to a</i><br>
<i> &gt;minority market of strange people who want to use it ( ;-) ). Person B, C,</i><br>
<i> &gt;and D have all suggested licencing the rights, but person A, won't hear of</i><br>
<i> &gt;it. </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I can see where people want to keep these to themselves, to create a trade</i><br>
<i> &gt;monopoly. You agree that monopolies are counterproductive ? Ofcourse</i><br>
<i> &gt;abandoning all patents and ownership rights on technology, would severely</i><br>
<i> &gt;limit R&amp;D investement. Maybe a compromise should be found, who enforces</i><br>
<i> &gt;this compromise ?  etc, etc... </i><br>
<p>
I don't think abandoning patents would limit R&amp;D investment at all. I<br>
have no idea what "the anarchocapitalist view" on patents is, because I<br>
am not the Pope of anarchocapitalism. As for me personally, I'm an<br>
intellectual property agnostic. I think patents and copyrights are<br>
probably a bad idea, possibly along with limited-liability corporate<br>
structures, and that all these things are creatures of the State. I'm<br>
not sure how one might recreate them in the absence of the State, but I<br>
doubt that they would be a big net loss. At the same time, I may very<br>
well be earning a living off of copyright someday, and I guess I'll just<br>
have to be opportunistic enough at that time to avoid being too troubled<br>
about it ethically. And then Lee Daniel Crocker can skewer me in our<br>
next debate about moral philosophy.  ;)<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;The few who do not do that anyway hardly require that</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;50% of the gross world product be spent on suppressing them, yet</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;that's how much (approximately) this planet spends on government.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I agree with the basics, but what you're suggesting here is a governement</i><br>
<i> &gt;trimmed down to only functioning on justice/ military/police levels, in</i><br>
<i> &gt;fact a police state. I wonder what strange and possibly dangerous people</i><br>
<i> &gt;would be leading such a state. </i><br>
<p>
Not at all! I'm suggesting a polycentric, pluralistic, system of<br>
competing protection and arbitration agencies, funded by insurance<br>
premiums, whose business is the protection of their clients from<br>
thugs and looters, and who do *not* hold monopolies on their markets<br>
that way States do. Now if you have any questions about this stuff,<br>
please direct them to someone else, or go read Friedman. I know it<br>
is very annoying to have somone shoot book titles at you instead<br>
of explanations, but really, Mr. Friedman has already done some<br>
very excellent work explaining these things, and it would be sheer<br>
wasted effort for me to duplicate his work. And if Mr. Friedman is<br>
too radical or too "American" for you, then I recommend Friedrich<br>
Hayek.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;it is not true that all possible political systems legitimize the use of</i><br>
<i> &gt;violence to punish voluntary and consensual exchange.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;The vagueness i was refering to was the possibility of conflict between</i><br>
<i> &gt;"voluntary" and "consensual". </i><br>
<p>
Voluntary means all parties are involved through their own "free will".<br>
Consensual means that all parties have consented to be involved in the<br>
interaction. How can these two notions conflict? Perhaps when I said<br>
"consensual" you were thinking "consensus". This is emphatically *not*<br>
what I had in mind. When I say "consensual" I am speaking of consent,<br>
not of consensus. Two very different things. Consent respects the<br>
individual, whereas insistence upon consensus makes holders of minority<br>
opinions feel as if they are sabotaging the process. This is why I have<br>
no respect for social systems that require consensus. I highly value<br>
diversity of opinion and belief, and insistence upon consensus squashes<br>
that while insistence upon consent protects and preserves it.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;but my political ideal is a new thing that has never been done</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;before, just as our ideal of eternal life is a new thing that has &gt;never</i><br>
<i> &gt;been done before.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;I'm sorry, but this is an obvious example of why i refered to your replies,</i><br>
<i> &gt;in the way i did, in our private mail. You're subtly suggesting here that</i><br>
<i> &gt;the two are to be linked by definition. Linking your personal political</i><br>
<i> &gt;convictions to extropic ideals. I hope you see my reasoning now, for the</i><br>
<i> &gt;conclusion i made earlier.          </i><br>
<p>
No. I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about here.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;&lt;irony&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;Why spend effort on goals that are unrealistic, such as space</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;migration, intelligence increase, and life extension? Why not focus</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;on ones that are achievable instead, like cutting taxes while</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;at the same time improving state-provided medical care and education?</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;&lt;/irony&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;&lt;rationalism&gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;realistic goals: majority of the people of earth are with you on</i><br>
<i> &gt;intelligence increase, space migration, life extension.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;unrealistic goal: minority of people are with you on creating an agorist</i><br>
<i> &gt;state. </i><br>
<i> &gt;&lt;rationalism&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Who cares? I only want to be able to live in the society of those<br>
people. We only actually live in the society of a few hundred people at<br>
a time... we can't really keep track of more than that. Relations of<br>
trade we can carry on with strangers, and with people who have different<br>
political beliefs. That is what the institutions of trade are for...<br>
to enable us to cooperate with people that we would not choose to<br>
socialize with. I don't know why you are assuming that everyone must<br>
live under the same political system... I don't know why you are<br>
assuming that it is irrational for me to hold certain political beliefs<br>
unless they are shared by 51% of the world population. It is precisely<br>
because I think minority societies should be allowed to select their own<br>
political systems that I oppose an overarching world state.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;I thereby</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;feel what amounts to nearly an obligation to oppose those dangerous</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;ideals in argument wherever I encounter them. </i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;Would you put your ideals of free trade before or after your ideals of</i><br>
<i> &gt;opposing other political systems ?</i><br>
<p>
How can these two be separated? I don't see these as separable things.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt; I'm still not sure I understand why you</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;are objecting to the response I made to Jim Legg.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;as i mentioned before, people project their sense of logic and  rationality</i><br>
<i> &gt;on their own political environment. Jims ideas were perfectly logical and</i><br>
<i> &gt;rational to HIM. I was objecting to the lack of understanding of that, in</i><br>
<i> &gt;general by replies from several people on this list. I may become a mild</i><br>
<i> &gt;libertarian, after some time spent on this list, as its ideas do interest</i><br>
<i> &gt;me a lot, but never, that is NEVER, will i let political ideals form an</i><br>
<i> &gt;obstacle for Transhumanist cooperation and communication. </i><br>
<p>
Fine. That's your choice. Why is it important to you that I follow your<br>
lead on this issue?<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;true, i just hope you appreciate people who have the same (transhumanist)</i><br>
<i> &gt;goals, but different routes (maybe faster ones?) to acchieve those goals.</i><br>
<p>
I was trying to explain, in an abbreviated and compressed manner, to Jim<br>
that the routes he was proposing would be *slower* routes toward our<br>
common transhumanist goals.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;&gt;Of course it is based on their personal financial improvement. If &gt;enough</i><br>
<i> &gt;people got *sincere* about being interested in their personal &gt;financial</i><br>
<i> &gt;improvement they might study a little microeconomics and &gt;then it would</i><br>
<i> &gt;become quite obvious to them how the politicians are &gt;robbing them blind.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;And the other half would find that they would be payed far less, have far</i><br>
<i> &gt;fewer benefits etc, and we'd have a civil war on our hands.</i><br>
<p>
I don't understand how you can make such assertions with such confidence<br>
given that you have never studied microeconomics. This stuff is<br>
considered "the basics" on this list, always has been, and you might as<br>
well get used to it. If you want to argue politics on this list, you<br>
have to show some understanding of microeconomics. Trying to do<br>
otherwise is like trying to strategize the development of the solar<br>
system without having any idea what "delta-vee" and "albedo" mean.<br>
<p>
I *know* that it is very rude and unpleasant for me to make assertions<br>
such as that in the previous paragraph... that is exactly why I<br>
chose not to develop this thread until you asked me to by private<br>
mail. If you want to discuss this stuff with me in depth, then I'm<br>
afraid I'm going to have to ask you to brush up on post-Marxist<br>
economics (Marshall, Pareto, the Austrians, etc.) because otherwise<br>
the terms that I use will seem "vague" to you, even though they<br>
are precise and well-defined technical terms... from microeconomics.<br>
Friedman's PRICE THEORY is a good introduction, and his more recent<br>
HIDDEN ORDER (not to be confused with Holland's book of the same<br>
title) covers much of the same theory in a more accessible way.<br>
