<i>&gt; Since it seems likely that we need _some_ government, to regulate</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessary non-local interactions (pollution, other public bane/public</i><br>
<i>&gt; good problems) and to make necessary but arbitrary decisions (which side</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the road to drive on), we still need to think about what form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; gov't to have, and representative legislatures still seem the best bet.</i><br>
<p>
Both of these fallacies have been sufficiently debunked: the "negative<br>
externalities" myth by Coase's work, and the "standards" idea by the<br>
simple evidence of reality that most standards are private.  It makes<br>
as little sense to me to argue about what kind of legislature is best<br>
as it would to argue how to make the slave trade more efficient.  The use<br>
of force to rule others is evil, period.  The strong burden of proof is<br>
on those who would rule us to prove that /any/ involuntary government is<br>
necessary before it makes sense to argue its form.  I have never seen any<br>
such argument; most feeble attempts simply assume some premise that<br>
would lead there, and never attempt to justify the premise.<br>
