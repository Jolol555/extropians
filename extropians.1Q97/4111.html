<i>&gt;        </i><br>
<i>&gt;If the chamber had a red dot and a blue dot then it would not have  </i><br>

<p>
Please describe a cylindrical symetric chamber <br>
which would negate the ability of identification.<br>

<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;one second after you first saw your double, a bullet hit him in  </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;the back of the head and his brain exploded. Regardless of whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;you are the copy or the original you still have all your memories  </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;and you still have a feeling on continuity with your past, just as </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;&gt;you do now, so nobody died.</i><br>
<i>&gt;             </i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;It's brain is dripping off the wall and it is not dead?</i><br>
<i>&gt;       &gt;Do you want to retract that?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have been known to retract things from time to time, but only when it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;clear I am wrong and No, I most certainly do not want to retract anything.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;I never said that a brain didn't die, I said nobody died.</i><br>
<p>
...and you think a brain is not a body?<br>
If your brain was on the wall would you be dead?<br>
How do you define dead?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;All objects are processes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That's debatable, Moravec things so, I'm not sure.</i><br>
<p>
Can you think of a thing that is not made of moving particles?<br>
I can not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;All processes are objects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Objects have a position and a momentum and can be destroyed.</i><br>
<p>
...neither created nor destroyed?<br>
The rain( process) in Spain( position) falls( at what momentum I am unsure) <br>
mainly in the plains(more specific position).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Where is arithmetic located? </i><br>
<p>
In your mind, where doe that exist?<br>
If a thing exists it has to exist somewhere.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What is the momentum of arithmetic? </i><br>
<p>
Momentum of thought.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How could I destroy arithmetic?</i><br>
<p>
Do not allow it to be thought.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;If I were to copy my self EXACTLY no thing would happen because two  </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;things can not occupy the same position in spacetime.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No, that's only true for fermions. Two identical bosons, like photons of  </i><br>
<i>&gt;light, can occupy the same position in spacetime but not so for fermions, </i><br>
<i>&gt;The Pauli Exclusion Principle tells us that 2 identical electrons can not be </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the same orbit in an atom. If we didn't know that then we couldn't </i><br>
<i>&gt;understand Chemistry, we wouldn't know why matter is rigid and not infinitely</i><br>
<i>&gt;compressible, and if we didn't know that atoms are interchangeable we </i><br>
<i>&gt;wouldn't understand any of that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Imagine what the world would be like if what you say is true. When I look at </i><br>
<i>&gt;you the photons of light coming from your face would collide with photons </i><br>
<i>&gt;coming at right angles to us scrambling them. Vision would be a useless way </i><br>
<i>&gt;to obtain information about the world.</i><br>
<p>
Why would photons travelling at right angles to us scramble ALL of them?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;I would like you to prove that a thing does not occupy a unique</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;position in spacetime.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;What is the radius of an electron?</i><br>
<p>
A=A<br>
if it exists in 3-D it has one.<br>
I do not have good enough eyes or a small enough ruler.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;We need not know for a thing to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt;Not true if you're talking about a change my consciousness, if the change </i><br>
<i>&gt;is so small that I can't detect it then my consciousness has not changed.</i><br>
<p>
Who says you are 100% aware of what you are thinking?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;The smallest change is change.        </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Do you disagree?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is a difference between a small change and a large change.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you disagree?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
One is small,<br>
one is large.<br>
Size is relative.<br>
Change is change.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;[Showing a chart of Fermions and Bosons]        </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Am I going to have to disprove all that too?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, and that would just be the start of your problems. If you insist that  </i><br>
<i>&gt;atoms have individuality then you must disprove every bit of that chart and  </i><br>
<i>&gt;do far more too, like explaining why matter is rigid,</i><br>
<p>
Is it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;why Chemistry has the </i><br>
<i>&gt;laws it does,</i><br>
<p>
Those are laws that have been assigned to it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; why Biology is possible ...</i><br>
<p>
If it were not possible it would not exist<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;If you exchange positions they are still the same distance from each</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;other, so why bother?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No reason to bother at all if atoms have no individuality, the system would </i><br>
<i>&gt;be unchanged. On the other hand if as you say each atom is different then  </i><br>
<i>&gt;exchanging atoms will change the system. </i><br>
<p>
Does it have to noticably change the system?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This has been tested experimentally  </i><br>
<i>&gt;many, many times.</i><br>
<p>
How many people argued about the shape of the earth?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;How about if I scatch an electron off?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Huh?                  </i><br>
<p>
It is possible to remove an electron from an atom right?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;You are saying when the distance between two things is 0 there are </i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;not two things.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                      </i><br>
<i>&gt;No, I am saying the probability of finding 2 electron, or any Fermion, </i><br>
<i>&gt;zero distance apart is zero.                   </i><br>
<p>
"Same" logic,<br>
no two things at 0 distance.<br>
Kind of strange to believe in a distance of 0( even in millinanometers).<br>
