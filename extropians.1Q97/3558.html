I only speak a little French, but with all the news coverage on this<br>
story I have tried to understand what the Paris Match magazine is<br>
saying about the radar images.<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.parismatch.tm.fr/actualite/twa800/framedepart.html">http://www.parismatch.tm.fr/actualite/twa800/framedepart.html</a> has 9 photos<br>
(purportedly) from the radar image which show activities in the minutes<br>
surrounding the accident.<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.parismatch.tm.fr/actualite/twa800/twa1.html">http://www.parismatch.tm.fr/actualite/twa800/twa1.html</a> shows one big and<br>
three small images from about the same period.<br>
<p>
The TWA flight is shown on the screen in the big picture as follows:<br>
<p>
    TWA800<br>
  / BET*37 H<br>
 C<br>
<p>
This has the flight number, TWA800; a designation of its departure route,<br>
BET; a speed indication, 37, for 370 knots; and the H for "heavy", standard<br>
designation for large airliners.  In the later images the BET is replaced<br>
by an altitude indication, for example 137 for 13,700 feet.  I believe the<br>
actual location of the plane is at the "C".<br>
<p>
The images on the page with four pictures has the above geometry,<br>
while the page with nine pictures has a slightly different one, with<br>
the label to the left of the "C" rather than to the right:<br>
<p>
   TWA800  \<br>
   129 37 H  \<br>
               C<br>
<p>
This suggests to me that the two pages are taken from different data sets,<br>
since the time of their images overlaps, but they consistently have these<br>
two different label formats.  There are also differences in the scale and<br>
the position of some other labels.  The relative plane positions are<br>
consistent between the two series of images, though.<br>
<p>
Large circles on the display are 10 (nautical) miles apart, I believe;<br>
this is how the FAA typically lays out controlled airspace, and it is<br>
consistent with the indicated speed of TWA800 and how far it travels<br>
between images.<br>
<p>
There are four objects marked on the various pictures.  The red circle<br>
shows a USAir flight which to the south and higher than TWA800.  The<br>
yellow circle shows a US Navy P3 Orion plane, which is apparently not<br>
in communication with the FAA ATC system.  The USAir and Orion blips<br>
approach each other, and they almost touch at the exact moment that<br>
TWA800 explodes.  This is apparently just a coincidence; they are two<br>
or three miles from flight 800, and presumably the planes are all at<br>
different altitudes.<br>
<p>
The page with the nine photos also shows two other objects.  A light green<br>
circle marks the unidentified object which I think is supposed to be the<br>
"missile".  It only appears on two of the images, west of TWA800, and<br>
doesn't look to me to be moving very quickly.  There is also a later<br>
object marked with a blue square a few minutes after the explosion,<br>
a Navy helicopter.<br>
<p>
The explosion occurs at 00 h 31 min 17 sec (according to one of the<br>
pages), which is the 6th picture in the 9-picture sequence.  The<br>
green-circled object appears on two images, one 41 seconds before the<br>
explosion and one 34 seconds before.  One question is whether it is<br>
moving fast enough and in the right direction to reach TWA800 at the<br>
moment it explodes.  My impression is that it is not.  It is hard to<br>
be certain given the small scale of the images, but the object appears<br>
to be about 6 or 7 miles west of TWA800 in the first picture, and<br>
still 6 or 7 miles west 7 seconds later.  In fact, I measured with a<br>
piece of paper and it is slightly farther from the "C" indicating the<br>
position of flight 800 in the second picture than in the first.  So it<br>
doesn't appear to be catching up to TWA800 at all.<br>
<p>
It would be very dramatic and exciting if it turned out that there were<br>
a big conspiracy to cover up an accidental missile hit, but the radar<br>
pictures which Paris Match is displaying don't make the case as far as<br>
I can tell.<br>
