In case it hasn't been previously, let me make it perfectly clear that my<br>
musings on this subject suppose use of cloned parts and whole bodies WITHOUT<br>
functioning brains and associated consciousness and personalities.  A human<br>
clone that has been allowed to develop naturally from birth is, without<br>
question, a full human being entitled to all the respect and expectations of<br>
reciprocity inherent in that status.<br>
