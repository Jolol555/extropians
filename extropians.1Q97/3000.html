I think the most important scientific implication from the recent sheep<br>
cloning experiment is that the mammalian genome does not appear to<br>
undergo irreversible changes as cells differentiate.<br>
In other words, the actual DNA which was removed from the adult sheep and<br>
implanted into the enucleated egg was completely intact.<br>
These cloning experiments could be used to refute the somatic mutation<br>
theory of aging. This states that aging is a direct consequence of<br>
accumulated mutations in the somatic (non-germ line) cells of the adult<br>
body. The DNA contained in the germ line cells (i.e testis and ovary) is<br>
assumed to be highly protected from mutations, otherwise entire species<br>
would age.<br>
The recent cloning experiments suggest that DNA can be kept in<br>
"good helath" without having to be confined to the germ line cells.They<br>
also suggest to me that aging could be (at least in part) an epigenetic<br>
phenomenon.<br>
I wonder how many years the original DNA from the donor sheep could be<br>
propagated in consecutive clones without going through the germ cells?<br>
It could turn out to be many times the lifetime of an average sheep.<br>
If we could find out how the cloning process is rejuvenating the DNA, we<br>
could try to mimic the process without actually having to clone ourselves.<br>
This would clear up a lot of the problems associated with identity etc.<br>
which have been discussed on this list.<br>
