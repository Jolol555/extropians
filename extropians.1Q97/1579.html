<i>&gt;Because, for one, the words politically correct, at first, were not a jab, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;joke or a poke at people who are trying to whine about their condition, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;get their way, but meant some one who had first done their homework and tried</i><br>
<i>&gt;to make an educated political decision. Which then became a kind of position,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and instead of being thinking, became unthinking.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now, for certain individuals, calling someone PC has become a DODGE out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;any tricky corner that someone finds themselves in, without having to explain</i><br>
<i>&gt;or educate your listener as to why you have your theories. You can call them</i><br>
<i>&gt;PC and that should cover it.</i><br>
<p>
Hi.  Do you have examples of "politically correct" meaning something<br>
positive before it became a negative epithet?  If you're right, it's<br>
fascinating history, but still...<br>
<p>
I think political correctness--the knee-jerk-liberalism kind--was (and<br>
still is) such a bad phenomenon that it deserves drastic defensive<br>
measures against it.  Drastic sanitary measures.  Any hint of the stuff<br>
needs to be burnt away with intense fires, *just in case*, just to be<br>
sure.  The ironic thing is that just *naming* the phenomenon was enough<br>
to alert most people to the problem, and provided an instant weapon<br>
against it, which was: just saying the phrase, just reminding people of<br>
the problem.  The problem is so bad that just mentioning it is considered<br>
an emphatic statement.<br>
<p>
There's a cost to the manic counter-trend, but I think it's more than<br>
justified.  The cost is making *extra* sure not to appear politically<br>
correct, even being willing to backtrack vigourously if one gets caught<br>
sounding PC.  Doing that demonstrates you understand the horrorible<br>
potential of PC.  If you don't understand that horror, you might not see<br>
the necessity, the justification, for the extreme counter-measures.<br>
<p>
The amazing thing is that PC had gone on so long without an effective<br>
defense.  It represents a serious vulnerability in our ways of<br>
thinking...or feeling or something.  Naming it has only been a start.<br>
<p>
The saving grace of the counter trend is that the phrase "politically<br>
correct" is ironic even if used in the most bludgeonly fashion.  It<br>
will never match the debate-stifling effect that actual political<br>
correctness had for so long.  And calling someone politically correct<br>
tells them how not to sound without dictating how they should sound--<br>
The Sound with the High Ground--as PCism still does.  PC is a plague<br>
that's going to take a while to cure and I think it's fair that people<br>
expect each other to do some careful stepping around it.  We don't<br>
exactly understand what it is but there's something BAD there so (we<br>
imply) steer clear.<br>
