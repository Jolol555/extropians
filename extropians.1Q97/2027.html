Jim Legg states:<br>
<p>
I have been on this list now since January 22, 1997 and did not noticed any<br>
spamming in that time as I have read every message. Now, how long ago was<br>
your last spamming attack, again? <br>
<p>
If you detect a current spamming attack, may I suggest that there is no<br>
spamming attack and that you are referring to my posts which you may<br>
consider to be an embarrassment and the source security breach "of your<br>
dup. storm." There certainly is a lot of coded call-to-arms language in<br>
this 'dup.' thread. May it be considered unethical and threatening should I<br>
as a newcomer be set up as the 'dupe' of your storm?<br>
<p>
Would you please tell me this is not so and that the meaning of 'dupes' is<br>
not as I have inferred? On the other hand if there is a legitimate reason<br>
to suspect an immanent flame war that I'm unaware of, it seems only politic<br>
to ask.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've moved all the messages out of the mail queue and I'm going through</i><br>
<i>&gt; them manually to try to weed out the dupes. The list should be operating</i><br>
<i>&gt; normally now.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Since I'm going to be out of town this weekend, the big question is</i><br>
<i>&gt; should I shut down the list on the off chance the spamming will</i><br>
<i>&gt; begin again while I'm gone?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Best,<br>
