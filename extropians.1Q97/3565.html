             Stud Dud Cigar Might Be Cloned <br>
<p>
Associated Press Thursday, March 13, 1997; 4:01 p.m. EST <br>
<p>
NEW YORK  Cigar's owner thinks the cloning of Cigar, two-time<br>
horse of the year, would be an interesting experiment. But<br>
that's apparently all it would be.<br>
          <br>
"We're certainly looking into cloning,'' said  Allen Paulson,<br>
who has the right to buy Cigar back should the 7-year-old horse<br>
prove sterile. <br>
  <br>
If Cigar were to be cloned, however, any resulting offspring<br>
most likely would be barred from racing by the Jockey Club. <br>
     <br>
Paulson told the Associated Press from California that cloning<br>
was not his idea. "I didn't start this,'' he said. <br>
            <br>
He said he was contacted by the New York Post's health and<br>
science writer, Roger Field, who asked him about cloning Cigar<br>
in light of recent experiments in Scotland involving the cloning<br>
of a sheep. <br>
 <br>
"I said it might be an interesting experment," Paulson told the<br>
AP. "If somebody who is qualified wants to come and get a patch<br>
off him it would be all right.'' <br>
<p>
Barry Simon, farm manager for Ashford Stud at Versailles, Ky.,<br>
said last week that 16 of 36 mares bred to Cigar had been tested<br>
and none was in foal. After Paulson retired Cigar last year, the<br>
horse was sent to Ashford Stud in a deal valued at $25 million.<br>
Cigar's stud fee is $75,000. <br>
  <br>
"There's no life in his sperm at all,'' Paulson told the Post.<br>
"They've checked over 20 mares, and all of them are barren. It's<br>
a big shock.'' <br>
<p>
Paulson said he owns Cigar but sydnicated him for stud, keeping<br>
10 shares and selling 30 shares to Coolmore Stud, which operates<br>
Ashford. <br>
<p>
When a stallion fails at stud, he becomes the property of the<br>
insurance company. Paulson said he would buy back Cigar from the<br>
insurance company. <br>
<p>
Scientists in Scotland who successfully cloned a sheep told the<br>
Post they don't know when, if ever, they will be able to clone a<br>
horse. <br>
<p>
"It's been done once in sheep, and whether it's transferable to<br>
other species, we don't know yet,'' said Dr. Harry Griffin of<br>
the Roslin Institute. "Other attempts ... will be in cattle and<br>
then probably in pigs.'' <br>
<p>
Dr. James Stewart of the American Association of Equine<br>
Practitioners told the Post there might be problems with a<br>
cloned horse's offspring. <br>
<p>
"When the clones start to breed, they'll bring out recessive<br>
traits,'' Stewart said. "You'll open some problems you don't<br>
want to think about.'' <br>
<p>
"I don't think the Jockey Club would allow cloning,'' Paulson<br>
said, "because it doesn't allow artificial insemination.'' <br>
<p>
The Jockey Club, which registers American thoroughbreds and sets<br>
rules for breeding and racing, bars from competition the<br>
offspring of mares impregnated by artificial insemination. The<br>
rules do not specifically address cloning, but soon will, a<br>
spokesman for the organization said today. <br>
<p>
The Jockey Club's regulation for registering a foal states the<br>
foal must "be a result of a stallion's natural service of a<br>
brood mare,'' said James Peden, vice president of corporate<br>
communications for the organization. <br>
<p>
"This regulation specifically excludes artificial insemination<br>
or embryo transfer'' Peden said, "and I expect the Stewards of<br>
the Jockey Club to add the words 'cloning by any means.' '' <br>
<p>
Cigar ended his career at age 6 as the richest horse ever, just<br>
shy of $10 million. He was retired to stud after he finished<br>
third in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Oct. 26 at Woodbine in<br>
Toronto. <br>
<p>
It was his second consecutive loss and third in four races since<br>
the end of his 16-race winning streak, which matched the modern<br>
record of Citation. The streak included a 10-for-10 record in 1995. <br>
            <br>
Cigar won an allowance race on Oct. 28, 1994 at Aqueduct, then<br>
didn't lose again until he was second to Dare And Go in the<br>
Pacific Classic on Aug. 10, 1996 at Del Mar. <br>
