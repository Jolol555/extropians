Some things never change, when I first joined the Extropian List over 3<br>
years ago it was in the middle of a discussion on free will, just like now.<br>
This is the very first post I ever sent to the list, I'm a little disappointed<br>
to note that I wouldn't change much in it, except I'd say something about<br>
Turing if I wrote it today.<br>
===================================================================<br>
<p>
There has been some discussion on this list about free will and it<br>
touched a raw nerve in me for I have had similar conversations when I get <br>
in a philosophical mood . The conversation usually centers on the question <br>
of whether Homo Sapiens has Free Will or not. Few ask what is meant by <br>
the term. I suppose they think it's so obvious so self explanatory that<br>
it's not worth talking or even thinking about. <br>
<p>
The discussion  invariably ends with a demonstration. Someone<br>
picks up an  object and drops it from one hand to the other and<br>
says "This proves I have Free Will, I  can hold it in my hand or<br>
I can drop it. If I drop it it's not because anything made me,<br>
in fact I could have held on to it but I just didn't feel like it".<br>
When asked why he didn't feel like it the only answer your<br>
likely to get is "I just didn't!" as if that explained everything.<br>
If I point out that I was the cause of the demonstration by bringing<br>
up the subject in the first place, anger sometimes results.<br>
To say "I can do anything I want to" is not an expression of absolute<br>
freedom but a severe restriction on it for the clear implication is<br>
"I can do nothing I don't want to".<br>
<p>
We feel certain that we are totally in control of our actions<br>
yet when someone acts in a way we don't understand we still ask<br>
"Why did you do that?" by which we mean what CAUSED you to do it.<br>
At the same time we pretend that our will is completely<br>
independent of external factors as if our behavior has no cause<br>
although if this was true our conduct would be totally random.<br>
No concept in Philosophy has been analyzed as poorly or has<br>
greater practical implications.<br>
<p>
This confusion largely stems from the enormously powerful<br>
intuitive feeling that we are not robots and that our minds are<br>
not deterministic. Indeed modern Physics has shown, by way of<br>
Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle and Bell's Inequality, that<br>
some things happen for no reason, in other words they are truly<br>
accidental. No one has shown that this element of chance extends<br>
to the workings of the mind but it seems likely that at least to<br>
some degree that it does. I maintain that randomness, whether it<br>
exists in the human brain or not, has much to do with the<br>
question of determinism but nothing to do with volition.    <br>
Intuition should not be dismissed lightly especially when it's<br>
almost universally held. But what is this intuition trying to tell us?<br>
People differ greatly over this but I think we can find a minimal<br>
definition of free will that almost everyone can agree on ;<br>
and that is a feeling of choice. This sensation of autonomy<br>
is a crucial aspect of our internal life so any successful<br>
theory of the Will must explain the source of this emotion.<br>
<p>
Let's simplify things to their essentials. Imagine a world in<br>
which the environment was so simple it could be predicted with <br>
complete accuracy. Doubtless we would find such a place boring<br>
and unpleasant but I don't think we would feel like robots.<br>
Thus the origin of the sensation of autonomy can not be external.    <br>
What does it mean to "feel like a robot"? I think that if you<br>
could always forecast your own behavior and thoughts with<br>
complete accuracy then you would feel like a robot. Uncertainty<br>
is at the root of freedom and choice. I hope to show that even<br>
in a predictable habitat and even ignoring whatever effects<br>
quantum uncertainty has on the macro-world, it is impossible,<br>
even in theory, to entirely foresee ones own conduct.<br>
<p>
For the mind to totally understand itself it must form a perfect<br>
internal model of itself. The model must not only describe the<br>
rest of the mind in every detail but it must also depict the<br>
model itself with a micro model. This micro model must represent<br>
the rest of the brain and the micro model itself with a micro<br>
micro model. This path leads to an impossible infinite regress.<br>
Both the brain and the model must be made up of a finite number<br>
of elements. If we are not to lose accuracy the components of<br>
the brain must have a one to one correspondence with the elements<br>
of the model. But this is impossible because the brain as a whole<br>
must have more members than the part that is just the model.<br>
<p>
This argument does not hold if the mind is infinite, that is if<br>
it has an infinite number of segments. It would be possible to<br>
find a one to one correspondence with a proper subset of itself;<br>
for example you CAN find a one to one correspondence between the<br>
set of odd integers with the set of all integers. Thus an<br>
infinite intellect could predict all its actions without error.<br>
So we are lead to the interesting conclusion that man has free will<br>
but GOD if SHE exists does not.<br>
<p>
Let me suggest a thought experiment; a man is walking down a<br>
road and spots a fork in the road far ahead. He knows of<br>
advantages and disadvantages to both paths so he isn't sure if<br>
he will go right or left, he hadn't decided. Now imagine a<br>
powerful demon able to look into the man's head and quickly<br>
deduce that he would eventually choose to go to the left.<br>
Meanwhile the man, whose mind works much more slowly than the<br>
demon's, hasn't completed the thought process yet. He might be<br>
saying to himself I haven't decided I'll have to think about it,<br>
I'm free to go either way. From his point of view he is in a<br>
sense correct, even a robot does not feel like a robot but from<br>
the demon's viewpoint it's a different matter, he simply deduced<br>
a purely mechanical operation that can have only one outcome.   <br>
But is it really a purely mechanical operation, what about the<br>
uncertainty principal? I don't see how it effects matters one<br>
way or another. It says that some things can happen for no cause<br>
and thus are truly random, but happenstance is the very opposite<br>
of intelligence and even emotion.<br>
<p>
Things either happen because of cause and effect or they don't<br>
and if they don't then they are by definition random and have nothing<br>
to due with volition. Those who claim that this is the source of the<br>
will must also believe that a nickel has free will when you flip it.<br>
This topic muddies the question but does not change it.<br>
<p>
In my example the demon did not tell the man of his prediction,<br>
but now lets pretend he did. Suppose also that the man, being of<br>
an argumentative nature, was determined to do the exact opposite<br>
of what the demon predicted. Now our poor demon would be in a<br>
familiar predicament. Because the demon's decision influences<br>
the man's actions the demon must forecast his own behavior, but<br>
he will have no better luck in this regard than the man did and<br>
for the same reasons. What we would need in a situation like<br>
this is a mega-demon able to look into the demon's head. Now the<br>
mega-demon would have the problem.<br>
<p>
As a final variation let's make our demon have an infinite mind.<br>
Now our demon would be able to have full self knowledge yet<br>
because of the man's decision to be contrary he still can not<br>
say what he will do, even if he knows what it is. So under<br>
certain circumstances there are some things that even a limitless<br>
mind can not do, it can not communicate with us freely.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we should return to earth now because unlike some<br>
esoteric controversies in philosophy this topic has some<br>
practical applications. Don't worry that a duplicate of you will<br>
not REALLY be you because the copy will feel like a robot, he won't.<br>
If the copy thinks you have survived, then you have. Also,<br>
in the matter of criminal law the general public and lawyers in<br>
particular have some strange ideas about the purpose of<br>
punishment. They seem to feel that if someone has derived<br>
pleasure in a evil way, it is the law's duty to somehow balance<br>
the books by making the lawbreaker suffer. The cliche about<br>
man being responsible for his own actions is merely a<br>
rationalization for sadism. This leads to endless convoluted<br>
irrelevant arguments reminiscent of the medieval one about pins<br>
and dancing angles. What was the mental state of the lawbreaker?<br>
Did he grow up in a good home as a child? Did he undergo a lot<br>
of strain as a adult? Is there anything physically wrong with<br>
his brain? Was he in full control of his faculties? And even a<br>
question that philosophers fight about to this day "does he know<br>
the difference between right and wrong?". Little wonder that the<br>
legal system is hopelessly backlogged.        <br>
<p>
The only logical or moral reason for punishing a wrongdoer is to <br>
prevent a similar crime from happening; it's the difference between<br>
justice and vengeance. Making an evil person suffer just for the<br>
fun of seeing him in pain is pointless and cruel, after all a<br>
bad man suffers just as intensely as a good man.<br>
                                            <br>
