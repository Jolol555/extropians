<i>&gt;Steve Edwards, former virologist, said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Aids is not at all male specific</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;in light of your very next sentence which seeks to explain WHY males make</i><br>
<i>&gt;up an "over abundance of AIDS cases in the US".  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyway, in regard to point (a) I would point out that viral AIDS should have </i><br>
<i>&gt;long since entered into the general population just like all authentic</i><br>
infectious <br>
<i>&gt;diseases, even if its point of entry 15 years ago was an incredibly promiscuous</i><br>
<i>&gt;gay flight attendant, as, I believe, the book The Band Played On speculates.</i><br>
<i>&gt;According to the hypothesis that AIDS is a sexually transmitted viral disease,</i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS should have long equilibrated between the sexes-exactly as predicted by</i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS establishment. The failure to leave specific risk groups in more than a</i><br>
<i>&gt;decade poses serious challenges to the virus hypothesis.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
1) AIDS is entering the general population.<br>
2) It hasn't equilibrated as yet because of a) the long latency period,  b)<br>
there are more male IV drug users than females, and c) it is still being<br>
spread by male homosexuals.<br>
3) Eventually it will equilibrate between the sexes. Be patient.<br>
<i>&gt;HIV seems equally distributed between the sexes, yet males make up</i><br>
<i>&gt;almost 9 out of 10 AIDS cases. Paradoxical to the theory that HIV</i><br>
<i>&gt;causes AIDS.</i><br>
<p>
You seem to think that the US is the only country with an AIDs problem.  <br>
AIDs is far more prevalent in Africa, where IV drugs are rarely used, and,<br>
if you believe the Africans, homosexual behavior is less common.  In Africa,<br>
AIDS is distributed equally between the sexes.  Ditto in Asia, where HIV and<br>
AIDs cases are skyrocketing.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;2)  There is something strange about the latency period.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Agreed.  The basis for the 10 year latent period of the virus, which </i><br>
<i>&gt;has a generation time of only 24 to 48 hours, is entirely unknown.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;There is no precedent for an infectious agent that causes primary </i><br>
<i>&gt;diseases on average only 10 years after transfusion in adults and only </i><br>
<i>&gt;after 2 years in children.  The diversity of these latent periods is </i><br>
<i>&gt;inconsistent with one infectious agent and their magnitude is </i><br>
<i>&gt;characteristic for diseases caused by chronic exposure to toxic substances.</i><br>
<p>
The latency period seems to differ with different sub-types of the virus, of<br>
which there are at least six.  Parts of Africa have a latency period of<br>
about two years.    Some persistent viruses can be dormant for years before<br>
causing disease.   Herpes can cause disease only periodically even though<br>
the patient is chronically infected.  <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Nevertheless, the vast majority of HIV positive people eventually </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;die of opportunistic infection, a fact that needs explaining.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;About 38% of all AIDS diseases, i.e. dementia, wasting disease,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kaposi's sarcoma, and lymphoma are neither caused by, nor necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt;associated with, immunodeficiency [World Health Organization, 1992;</i><br>
<i>&gt;and CDC, 1992]. In these AIDS indicator diseases that</i><br>
<i>&gt;are not caused by immunodeficiency, HIV is not even present in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;diseased tissues, e.g., there is no trace of HIV in any Kaposi's sarcomas</i><br>
<i>&gt;[Salahuddin, S.K., S. Naecamura, P. Biberfeld, M.K. Kaplan, P.D.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Markham, L. Larsson, and R.C. Gallo.  Angiogenic properties of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kaposi's sarcoma-derived cells after long-term culture in vitro. Science</i><br>
<i>&gt;242 (1988): 430-433] and there is no HIV in neurons of patients with </i><br>
<i>&gt;dementia, because of the generic inability of retroviruses to infect </i><br>
<i>&gt;nondividing cells like neurons.</i><br>
<p>
Kaposi's sarcoma is almost non-existent in people with a functioning immune<br>
system.  Similarly, most people don't get fungus growing on their lips and<br>
tongue, but AIDs patients do.  This has to do with a broken immune system,<br>
not with HIV infecting their lips. Neurons don't divide but other nervous<br>
system cells, like glia, do.  <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;people eventually die ...a fact that needs explaining.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;From its recognition in 1981, AIDS has been restricted in Europe and</i><br>
<i>&gt;America to patients from abnormal risk groups whose health had been</i><br>
<i>&gt;severely compromised prior to the onset of symptoms.</i><br>
<p>
Bullshit.  Many people are perfectly healthy before they come down with AIDS.<br>
 About 60% of<br>
<i>&gt;AIDS patients in America are male homosexuals who have abused</i><br>
<i>&gt;psychoactive and aphrodisiac drugs (including nitrate inhalants),</i><br>
<i>&gt;about 33% are IV drug users and their children, 2% are transfusion</i><br>
<i>&gt;recipients, and 1% are hemophiliacs.  Only about 3% of American</i><br>
<i>&gt;AIDS patients are from "undetermined exposure categories". (CDC 1992)</i><br>
<p>
And at one time, 99% of AIDs patients in America were homosexuals.  How do<br>
children get AIDS if not by the virus?  Are the effects of nitrate inhalants<br>
on to children?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is argued that health risks associated with these groups, and not HIV,</i><br>
<i>&gt;is causing AIDS.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;HIV is correlated with AIDS because IV drug users who share needles, </i><br>
<i>&gt;for example, are collecting viruses the way some people collect stamps.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The higher the consumption of unsterile drugs, the more accidentally</i><br>
<i>&gt;contaminating microbes will be accumulated. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;3)  HIV, by itself, is not what kills you.  It only destroys your immune</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;system.  Hence it is not odd that different risk groups should have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;different symptoms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The existence of risk-group-specific AIDS-defining diseases in the absence </i><br>
<i>&gt;of HIV challenges your assertion. Controlled studies indicate that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;incidence of AIDS-defining diseases in IV drug users and in male </i><br>
<i>&gt;homosexuals engaging in high-risk behavior and hemophiliacs </i><br>
<i>&gt;is independent of HIV. Each health risk group has nonviral health risks</i><br>
<i>&gt;that are necessary and sufficient causes of AIDS </i><br>
<p>
That's exactly my assertion, that misfunction of the immune system makes it<br>
much more likely that you will come down with and die from diseases specific<br>
to your community.  Most people can fight off TB (the non-resistant variety)<br>
with a little help from antibiotics, for instance.  AIDs patients have no<br>
chance.  However, even an AIDs patient will not die from TB if he is not<br>
exposed to it. Hence, each risk group will have its own constellation of<br>
AIDs defining diseases. <br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The AIDs infrastructure has at time been alarmist and overconfident of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;research claims.  It wants money thrown at it. Nevertheless,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;one should not throw out all the HIV/AIDs research </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;on that grounds.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't.  I reject the theory that HIV causes AIDS on the grounds</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it violates so many established principles of virology.</i><br>
<p>
I suspect that the situation is a little more complicated than simply HIV=AIDs.<br>
Luc Montagnier, the real discoverer of HIV has proposed a model which<br>
involves two components, with the other component not yet identified,<br>
possibly some for of mycoplasma.  But that HIV is clearly implicated in the<br>
worldwide AIDs epidemic, I have no doubt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Duesberg can't be trusted... he's into publicity for it's own sake...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Peter Duesberg has fought with courage and tenacity to drag</i><br>
<i>&gt;a reluctant scientific community back to AIDS sanity since</i><br>
<i>&gt;detecting falsehoods in the HIV story more than a decade ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt;His efforts have earned him much personal abuse, but may</i><br>
<i>&gt;ultimately save countless lives"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Neville Hodgkinson, editor, The London Sunday Times</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dr. Peter Duesberg's courage and his book Inventing the AIDS</i><br>
<i>&gt;Virus will save millions of lives.  He is not only one of the few</i><br>
<i>&gt;people in the world qualified enough to see through the scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;'AIDS scam', but he is the only one who has sacrificed his</i><br>
<i>&gt;career to save the world from it."</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tony Brown, host of PBS's "Tony Brown's Journal"</i><br>
<p>
Both of these qualify as AIDS experts?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Both these observers note the price that questioning the accepted</i><br>
<i>&gt;wisdom has taken on Duesbergs' career.  From having his</i><br>
<i>&gt;Outstanding Investigator Grant from the NIH canceled, to being</i><br>
<i>&gt;censored by the editor of Nature (John Maddox), and being insulted</i><br>
<i>&gt;("It's the virus, stupid" from Ho, current Time Magazine 'Man of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Year'), Duesberg could have certainly chosen an easier path to</i><br>
<i>&gt;publicity.  I think he is a bit of a modern-day Galileo in that regard.</i><br>
<p>
Or he may be a stubborn fool.  Time will tell.<br>
