In a message dated 97-03-09 01:55:39 EST, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; Guess what, there's always going to be people <br>
 who disagree, and to the guy who was afraid I'd "smother" his movement with <br>
 my "pessimism", I say, WAKE UP! Guess what, the future won't be that much <br>
 fun. &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Ok, . . .  <br>
 <br>
1.  You are pessimistic.  You admit it.  You love it. <br>
 <br>
2.  You are not even realistic, but admit to be far into pessimism (which is<br>
not being realistic).  In fact, I think _even_ being so called "realistic" is<br>
still being pessimistic because improvement is given up on. <br>
 <br>
3.  You say you "know" the future, the "real" future not just imagined?<br>
 That's more than I can say.  How are you doing that.  Fill me in on your new<br>
future-predictive technology. <br>
 <br>
4.  You think the future will not be all that much fun?   Do you still want<br>
to see the future then?  Why should you?  You like pessimism and want to see<br>
your pessimistic future come true?  Are you working to bring about a more<br>
pessimistic future so you prediction is vindicated?   <br>
 <br>
Please show me why I have misinterpreted you. <br>
<p>
<p>
Dynamically Optimistic,<br>
