No, I was postulating a Saturn V.  The time given above is for an object<br>

the first place.  Where did your acceleration figure come from?<br>

Perhaps.  It wouldn't kill an Earth power to just launch missiles from<br>
the ground, a la Apollo; I was just noting that vastly greater speeds<br>
aren't very hard to obtain.  As the US already has the power to wipe out<br>
most life on the planet, objecting to putting some missiles in orbit<br>
would be somewhat silly, although somewhat natural.  But the US might<br>
not care.  Or the US might sell it as a defense against lunar rebels.<br>
Or claim it's just part of a meteoroid defense system... hell, it might<br>
actually _be_ a meteoroid defense system.  Big nuke on fast rocket<br>
capable of hitting a slow target.  Should be somewhat flexible.<br>

Assuming your numbers were correct, so what?  Conquest and destruction<br>
are completely different things.  That's why your supposed differentials<br>
don't apply to Luna -- regardless of who attacks first, each side is<br>
fighting by attacking the other with big weapons.  Different big<br>
weapons, but big weapons.<br>

Ah, would these stockholders still be on Earth?  If so, I hope I don't<br>
have to expand on the flaws in this scenario.  Even if not, the colony<br>

off.<br>

<p>
Again, I'm not saying there aren't scenarios where a young colony can't<br>
break away.  In some scenarios they might be let go without pain.  I<br>
just don't see that the gravity well is a super-ace that lets Luna off<br>
under any conditions.<br>
<p>
Another variation: Luna declares independence.  Earth protests formally<br>
and harasses any ground connection but otherwise does not attack.  Earth<br>
then heavily invests in getting a government presence in space, which<br>
can compete directly with Mikeycorp or turn against you later, "bringing<br>
the deviants back into the fold."  An attempt to maintain your monopoly<br>
in space before the gov't grows strong there then justifies a<br>
destructive attack against you.<br>

In my understanding, past a certain level of current the self-inducted<br>
magnetic fields interfere with whatever is happening inside the<br>
superconductor, which then stops being a superconductor.  In the case of<br>
metals, you still have a conductor.  In the case of ceramics, you have a<br>
wonderful space heater.  Given the complexity of the superconducting<br>
phenomenon, I would be rather surprised if you could have arbitrary<br>
amounts of current be carried with no resistance without limit.  So<br>
whether an EMP directly induces current past the maximum load, or heats<br>
the superconductor past its critical temperature causing a failure that<br>
way, there could be a problem.<br>
