Yes, indeed. How many high-level mathematicians do you know? Most of them<br>
are not attractive in the same way as Lyle's friend. Whether that's<br>
because they're mathematicians or was true beforehand is another question. <br>

<i>&gt; What an odd thing if you do. What does one thing have to do with another?</i><br>
<p>
Because, as he said, serious mathematical/science study programs you to<br>
think in certain ways. In most cases this seems to make people more<br>
introverted and less aware of their physical appearance. It certainly<br>
tends to cut them off from ecstatic states, which seems to be one major<br>
aspect of physical attraction. <br>
