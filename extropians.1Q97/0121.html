Oh, what was that movie, fellow Americans, the one where Jaime Escalante<br>
teaches calculus in two years to LA ghetto Hispanics who hardly knew<br>

On the other hand, even if everyone exercises fully I think there would<br>
still be difference in physical achievement.  Why not in mental<br>
capability as well?  Why should humanity be quantized between the<br>
physiologically retarded and everyone else, rather than being<br>
distributed on a continuum of ability, from idiots to polymorphic<br>
polymaths?<br>
