Yes, the sensors on Clementine that suggested the existence of water on<br>
the south pole of the moon in a crater that was in perpetual darkness,<br>
saw what they saw by starlight from a hundred or more miles up. pretty<br>
good sensors...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I don't care, because all that really matters to me is the crater size and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;James figures seemed to scale to roughly the same values as on Earth. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;only disadvantage is that I'd have a harder time destroying your</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;multi-kilometer long string of superconducting coils? I may not even need</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to hit it to destroy it. James?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am not aware of any EMP studies on superconductors.  Obviously, they could</i><br>
<i>&gt; handle EMP up to a certain point without a problem due to their</i><br>
<i>&gt; superconducting nature, but superconductors do have flux load limits.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt; would certainly offer more protection than ordinary conductors, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you are using the supercooled ceramic type superconductors.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; (unqualified) theory is that when you have a flux overload, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; superconductor would start to heat up.  At a certain temperature point, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would resume an entirely ceramic nature, which would then be unaffected by</i><br>
<i>&gt; EMP.  If this was the case, EMP might be more of a nuisance than a threat.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But I am not qualified to make any kind of definitive judgement on this.</i><br>

Thanks James. Neither am I, and maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that<br>
superconductors are unaffected by magnetic fields? In any event, even if<br>
it suffered from flux overload, it would simply put the gun out of<br>
action for a minute at most. As superconductors also conduct heat<br>
extremely efficiently,  from what I've read, then the coils would cool<br>
pretty quickly. Even if I'm wrong about the temp conduction thing,  it<br>
would still cool down pretty soon and be operable again.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Hmm, isn't that about the same figure that I gave, if you scale it for 1MT</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;your figure would be larger. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; After doing additional research, I may have to modify my above stated</i><br>
<i>&gt; figures a little bit.  The 500-1000 meter range for a 1-Mt lunar surface</i><br>
<i>&gt; burst was extrapolated from nuclear data for surface bursts on earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; (obviously, since there have never been lunar nuclear tests).  The problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that it was difficult to remove atmospheric related cratering effects</i><br>
<i>&gt; from blast and ground shock related effects, since my engineering books</i><br>
<i>&gt; always assume that the blast occurs on earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It occurred to me that studying *underground* nuclear tests, I could get</i><br>
<i>&gt; information on nuclear explosions in an environment where atmospheric</i><br>
<i>&gt; factors are not involved.  Unfortunately, nobody publishes underground</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear test data.  What I was able to do, however, was get information on</i><br>
<i>&gt; yield and crater dimensions after the underground chamber collapsed for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; couple underground tests.  There are standard civil engineering equations</i><br>
<i>&gt; that allowed me to reconstruct the underground blast damage effects based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; crater dimension and shape.  Based on this data, I constructed a new set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; data for lunar explosions based on underground nuclear tests.  I think this</i><br>
<i>&gt; data may be more accurate, since it only reflects ground shock related damage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I based my results on a 10-Mt lunar surface burst, since this seems to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "standard" baseline for argumentative purposes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For a lunar 10-Mt yield, distance from ground zero:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 0-500 meters    :you are screwed</i><br>
<i>&gt; 500-800 meters  :hardened shelter required</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;800 meters     :standard lunar structure should survive</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These figures assume that underground nuclear tests are reasonably accurate</i><br>
<i>&gt; models for calculation of lunar nuclear effects.</i><br>
<p>
I think that they may still be optimistic. Vacuum and hard space<br>
radiation have a particularly insidious capability to sinter materials<br>
together over time, so lunar ground is much more solid than even desert<br>
scrublands. Also, what did you do to account for energy in the blast<br>
reflected back to space? I would be interested in learning your<br>
equations/calculations/methodology for  coming to these conclusion....<br>
Even though I still love em. i'm just curious....<br>
<p>
General Grant, I will respectfully accept your surrender when you have<br>
finally come to your senses..... he he....<br>
