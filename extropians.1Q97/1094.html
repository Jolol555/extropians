<i>&gt;It has no /specific/ referent, as it is defined above, in terms</i><br>

<p>
The original topic of discussion was reason vis a vis emotion. Are<br>
you now contending that emotion is unreal? I think your original<br>
contention was that reason has a valid principal role to play in<br>
cognition, and that emotion has no role to play in cognition. Of<br>
course, you are replying to my questioning of the idea that Reason<br>
refers to anything other than a tradition, an evolved information<br>
structure loose and messy and large, but if you want to take the<br>
tack you are taking above, then you need to balance your argument<br>
for the reality of reason with another argument for the unreality<br>
of emotion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If a specific method under question produces knowledge inconsistent</i><br>
<i>&gt;with our conscious experience of reality, to the limits of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;ability to measure it, then it isn't reason.</i><br>
<p>
"Consistency" has a clear and precise meaning in the study of formal<br>
systems, and you are banking on that meaning. But "consistency", as a<br>
relation between "knowledge" and "conscious experience of reality" is a<br>
radically unclear notion. This is not a definition of a poorly<br>
understood notion in simpler and better understood terms; this is just a<br>
postponement. Both "knowledge" and "conscious experience of reality"<br>
refer to information processes within human brains that we have barely<br>
begun to grasp. (Emotions are another example of information processes<br>
within human brains that we have barely begun to grasp.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In judging methods,</i><br>
<i>&gt;consistency is required, completeness not.  I.e., any method that</i><br>
<i>&gt;produces false knowledge even once is out,</i><br>
<p>
Science produces such "false knowledge" all the time... and then moves<br>
on and corrects it. (Once again, my harping on the luminiferous ether.)<br>
Is science then not to be understood as an instance of reason?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The point I am trying to make is that given the current state of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; cognitive science, the word "reason" might very well turn out to be as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; free of content as "caloric" or "phlogiston".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are those words truly free of content?</i><br>
<p>
No, they are not. But you don't seem to realize that encouraging people<br>
to operate within the tradition of Reason is a very different thing<br>
from encouraging them to use a screwdriver instead of a hammer. Our<br>
concepts are informed by varying degrees of careful study of reality;<br>
"oxidation" is better informed in this way than "phlogiston" is. My<br>
contention is that "reason" is a traditional concept that has evolved<br>
through the use of words, and not a concept that has itself emerged from<br>
the careful and direct study of reality. We are only recently embarking<br>
on the kind of empirical study of brains and neurocomputational<br>
processes that *might* yield a scientific concept that would warrant the<br>
precision and semantic force that you are asking of "reason".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That begs the question of how you evaluate the "quality" of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;information, doesn't it?  Do you want it to be more entertaining, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;more voluminous, or more enlightening?</i><br>
<p>
I am not quite sure what you might mean by "enlightening". What I had in<br>
mind was precision, accuracy, clarity of expression, and relevance to my<br>
selfish concerns (which, we have found through trial and error, seem to<br>
have some overlap with the selfish concerns of the other list<br>
subscribers). Perhaps if you would harp on these terms (rather than<br>
harping on Reason), you would get more of the kind of effect you are<br>
seeking to produce.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In one sense, I agree: I have no way to experience what you experience</i><br>
<i>&gt;directly, so I cannot prove that you don't have knowledge of Truth</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I don't have.  So when someone describes an idea that, to me,</i><br>
<i>&gt;contradicts my experience, I have three choices. (1) there is no shared</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality, (2) I am mistaken, (3) he is mistaken.  </i><br>
<p>
Pfah! There are a host of other possibilities. The chiefest one of which<br>
that leaps to my mind is that you might be correct in your belief and<br>
incorrect in your misunderstanding of the idea that the other person has<br>
attempted to describe. What you are overlooking is that communication is<br>
difficult, accurate transfer of valuable information from one human mind<br>
to another is *difficult*, and your devil-may-care attitude toward human<br>
emotions does less than nothing to enhance the process.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; that words cannot hurt people. This is an attitude that I would *expect*</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to find only among those who are accustomed to using physical force to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; hurt people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Interesting.  Hate to blow your theory, but I've never thrown a punch</i><br>
<i>&gt;in my life, never owned a gun, and am utterly repulsed by violence.</i><br>
<p>
This doesn't blow my "theory", since it contained no assertions about you.<br>
Besides, I deliberately expressed it as a mere expectation and not a<br>
theory, so that you wouldn't think I was trying to take a cheap shot at<br>
you. But apparently you thought so anyway. I wonder why?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suppose that might be one reason why I like to move combat to the realm</i><br>
<i>&gt;of ideas instead.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, yes, I love a good fight myself. That's why I'm giving you one. But<br>
you should be able to distinguish between someone who is seeking an<br>
aggressive argument and someone who is seeking a cooperative discussion.<br>
Both can be carried on as positive-sum-games, but why limit yourself<br>
only to exchanging information with people who like aggressive argument?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I fought</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the idea of restraint for its own sake; the idea that a listener's</i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional reaction to speech should, in itself, make that speech immoral.</i><br>
<p>
I guess what I'm fighting for is the idea of context-sensitivity in<br>
these things. I am not interested in debating the morality of these<br>
topics right now: morality is an immense field of study in its own<br>
right. What I am wondering is how you could possibly believe that it is<br>
in your or anyone else's interest for you to close off the mind you are<br>
addressing by provoking negative emotional reactions in em? In<br>
aggressive argument, we (or at least I) use such negative emotional<br>
reactions as spurs, as sources of "mental energy", but not everyone's<br>
mind works this way. What leaves me befuddled is that you seem to be<br>
taking the position that you can somehow benefit from hurting the<br>
feelings of people you are trying to talk to in a way that makes them<br>
less receptive to your message. Why even bother? How "rational" is that<br>
kind of behavior? I wouldn't call this kind of speech "immoral" so much<br>
as "self-defeating". I'll let you draw your own conclusions about the<br>
morality of self-stultifying actions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If the speech is false, and intended /only/ to evoke the reaction, then</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps it is immoral.  But if the speech is true, and intended to help</i><br>
<i>&gt;the speaker find more knowledge or gain some other value, then the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the listener's reactions should not in itself be cause for restraint.</i><br>
<p>
Intentions? Who cares about intentions? Kantians, perhaps. If the speech<br>
is true, and defeats the very purpose for which it was uttered... well,<br>
as I said, draw your own conclusions.<br>
