The following are responses to TOMorrow, Kathryn Aegis, and Sarah Marr:<br>

<p>
You have just defined it then. You have defined art as something to be<br>
created, shared, and enjoyed. This definintion corrollates directly with<br>
my subjective definition of art: the manifestation of our pleasures, and<br>
ignores my objective definition: that art is the status of our<br>
condition. Specifically, the collective art of an individual reflects<br>
the individual's condition, and the collective art of an organization,<br>
nation, or society, reflects the condition of that society. You may deny<br>
the latter definition, but in so doing, you deny arts scientific<br>
usefulness; you regulate art to the ephermeral only.<br>
<p>
Objectively, it does not matter what an artist intends when they create<br>
a work of art, they may intend nothing in particular, or they may intend<br>
something specific and not attain it, but either way, that art still<br>
expresses their condition. It is difficult to see this in contemporary<br>
art because we do not have the distance in time to be very objective.<br>
Hoever look at art of any other period, start with the cave art of<br>
20-25,000 years ago, and work your way up. In the same way that we can<br>
look back at this art today and determine the general psychological<br>
condition of those civilizations, people in our near future will be able<br>
to look at our art today and do the same thing, and better than we are<br>
now able to do with art of the past ourselves, for the people of the<br>
future will have even better understanding of psychology coupled with a<br>
great deal more data to make objective corrollations with.  <br>

<i>&gt; Your above statement represents only one definition of art, and it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; one that I as an artist do not subscribe to.</i><br>
<p>
The fact that you do not subscribe to it does not make it any less real.<br>
It only shows a determinism to deny that facet of art. I don't have to<br>
subscribe to a definition of the earth which says the earth is round. I<br>
can hold tenaciously to a belief that the earth is flat, but that does<br>
not change the reality of what the earth really is.<br>

Not true. It is fine to believe this, but it is wholly untrue. You<br>
cannot *fully* escape the conditions of your time, and the very attempt<br>
itself to escape or deny the conditions of your time is a response to<br>
your time in itself. You are by degree, perhaps less than some,<br>
determined by the limitations of your era. Even striving not to be<br>
limited by your era is a response to your era itself. As much as you may<br>
wish to avoid the truth of it, when you make art, you are making a<br>
statement of condition about yourself, the institutions you are member<br>
of, the nation you are member of, and the era itself you are member of.<br>
And people of the future, and perhaps people from other worlds also,<br>
will be able to look back on your art, and make objective observations<br>
on it.  <br>

<i>&gt; and to accept those types of </i><br>

<p>
This is fine. If you do not consciously create boundaries for your art,<br>
which few people do, and I do not personally recommend or discourage it,<br>
the boundaries on your art will be set unconsciously. Either way, your<br>
work can still be analysed objectively as a statement of condition.<br>
<p>
As artists we like to imagine we are absolutely unique and uninfluenced<br>
by outside forces. But this really is not the case. Some specific<br>
boundaries that are set by an era, techniques that are possible,<br>
technology that can be employed, ubiquitous concerns, conditions of<br>
life, limitations of our current degree of knowledge. We can only<br>
imagine things so far beyond what currently is and what is currently<br>
possible. This itself is a limitation of any era; it is a limitation on<br>
your art. <br>

TOMorrow:<br>
<i>&gt;Art, like its proper subset writing, has no particular purpose beyond expressing ideas.</i><br>
<p>
Art can also express feelings, and conditions of existence.<br>

<i>&gt; They respond just as subjectively: their subjectivity is merely more</i><br>

<p>
No, not "just" as subjectively. Trained scientific professionals are<br>
trained not to act "just" as subjectively. Trained scientific<br>
proffessionals base their observations on collected scientific data.<br>
There is a major difference between interpreting artwork subjectively,<br>
"What do I personally think or feel about this work?", and interpreting<br>
it objectively, "How do the qualities of this work corrallate with the<br>
collected data at my disposal?"<br>
<p>
I can look up at the stars and say, "Wow those are beautiful," and then<br>
continue to make up all kinds of astrological fairy tales about those<br>
stars, or I can seek to become more objective in my interpretation of<br>
the stars and create a science called, astronomy. Again, if you chose to<br>
believe in astrological fairy tales rather than astronomical facts, that<br>
will not detract from the astronomical truth. You do not have to believe<br>
in an objective definition of art for such to exist. <br>

Yes. <br>
