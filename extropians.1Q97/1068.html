<i>&gt; Yes. Now you slavishly serve your memes, such as your superstitious</i><br>
<i>&gt; rigid belief in a clearcut and well-understood distinction between</i><br>
<i>&gt; "reason" and "emotion". You haven't got the foggiest idea what the</i><br>
<i>&gt; referents of those words are: no one does, as of yet. You could</i><br>
<i>&gt; just as easily be dogmatically ranting about phlogiston or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; luminiferous ether.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, it's true that I haven't got a clue what "emotion" refers<br>
to, and I never claimed to.  I do, however, have a very clear referent<br>
in mind for what I call "reason", though I have been less than<br>
successful at communicating what that is.  I don't know what emotion<br>
is precisely, but since I do experience a set of sensations that<br>
are consistent with what other people describe as emotion, I can<br>
identify some of those things as distinct from my referent for reason,<br>
which I will try to describe here briefly (in somewhat abbreviated<br>
form): I have a specific referent for "knowledge", and for "reality",<br>
and for what it means for the former to be consistent with the latter.<br>
I use the word "reason" to mean "those principles and methods--which<br>
may change over time--that lead to the acquisition of knowledge that<br>
is consistent with reality." <br>
<p>
I will also freely admit that I have some emotional attachment to<br>
specific principles and methods like formal logic and experiment.<br>
I have not found anything better yet.  I am underwhelmed by those<br>
alternatives--including the alternatives some have suggested here<br>
of combining or balancing them with others--which I have seen.  I<br>
suspect I will never find better alternatives, but I cannot rule it<br>
out entirely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The funniest thing is that in your foolish ranting against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; passions, you don't even notice that you are entirely caught up in</i><br>
<i>&gt; your emotional passion for rationality. You just blindly whirl</i><br>
<i>&gt; about in your libertarian macho-flash routine, giving the beliefs</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you happen to share with me a bad name in your community (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; pisses me off, incidentally), prating about "free will" while</i><br>
<i>&gt; functioning as a marionette for Ayn Rand's mind.</i><br>
<p>
(1) Please provide a sample of my text where I "rant against passion."<br>
I've done no such thing, I merely point out that it is often used for<br>
purposes ill-suited to it, namely cognition.  If I pointed out that a<br>
screwdriver drove screws better than a hammer, would you call that a<br>
rant against hammers?  That I was some robotic screwdriver-worshipping<br>
anti-hammerist?<br>
<p>
(2) Yes, I am passionate about reason, and I recognize that.  It works<br>
anyway.<br>
<p>
(3) If you search for messages from me with "Rand" in them, you will<br>
find them generally critical, so I'm not sure why you see me as a<br>
puppet to her mind, just because we happen to reach many of the same<br>
conclusions and share many ideas.  I do admire her genius, but I am<br>
quite capable of also seeing her mistakes and using my own mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Oh, I'm sorry. Was I rude? I'm just calling it like I see it here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I certainly hope you won't be so irrational as to allow any of your</i><br>
<i>&gt; buttons to be pushed by this post. Perhaps when you respond, you'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; show some evidence of actually having read it, rather than simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; seizing another opportunity to grind your ax at us.</i><br>
<p>
If they get pushed, I will work on correcting that.  I see nothing<br>
rude in your post if it is truly the way you experience my words.<br>
Indeed, you did make me spend some time focusing on my definitions<br>
of terms I use that I might not have done in response to a more<br>
conciliatory post.  I cannot say, though, whether my motivation for<br>
spending more mental energy in this reply than others resulted from<br>
the nature of the post of from the fact that I anticipated it after<br>
our meeting last night.<br>
<p>
And yes, I recognize that that last sentence shows that I allowed<br>
emotional reactions ("motivation", "anticipation") to materially<br>
affect my reasoning process ("spend more mental energy on this").<br>
I recognize that fact by reason.<br>
