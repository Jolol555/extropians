Robin asked:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of you so damn confident that you know how such things would actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; function, or which minute variation would actually be best?  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Mark Grant responded:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is basically an engineering decision; authoritarian societies</i><br>
<i>&gt; give &gt;you many single points of failure which libertarian societies</i><br>
<i>&gt; can eliminate.</i><br>
<p>
Robin also wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; The most common concern about PPLs is that is that local competition</i><br>

..<br>
<i>&gt; private patrols now do), and people on the street would need to wear</i><br>
<i>&gt; some distinguishing mark if they want buy extra deterrence.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
We tried as many might recall creating PPL for this mailing list and<br>
this was a very doomed effort. It's failure shouldn't be seem as a<br>
failure to PPLs (they just might not work well for small mailing<br>
lists).<br>
<p>
We I think we learned a few things.<br>
<p>
The first is that your PPL needs to be some what selective about who<br>
it admits, much like the admission committees at private clubs, coops,<br>
and condo's.<br>
<p>
You might buy a particular type of deterrence as might an other member<br>
say extra protection from those with Undergraduate degrees in English<br>
(like myself). You even though you have this deterrence you might try<br>
to avoid English majors, but an other member of the PPL, with<br>
deterrence "in hand" so to speak, might start baiting English Majors<br>
and even hanging out at "their" bars (making fights), and try to date<br>
"members" of their population, etc.<br>
<p>
The real cost for your membership and the cost of the membership for<br>
this more aggressive person would be different. This aggression minded<br>
member could really hurt things, getting more and more English majors<br>
polarized against you and/or your PPL, etc. Again not only increasing<br>
the real costs but also making agreements with other PPL's more<br>
difficult to maintain.<br>
<p>
I know this is a silly example but I'm trying to get to is a way of<br>
showing that running a PPL might not be as straight forward as it<br>
seems. In my co-op no one is allowed on the roof after 8pm, yet when<br>
there are fireworks many use the roof and in general day in and day<br>
out it is also used. It (the rule) is there not to stop be from using<br>
the roof at 10pm but to prevent me from being a trouble maker on the<br>
roof and the Co-op having no recourse. Likewise there are 100 other<br>
rules that our part of our house rules, most of which are not enforced<br>
unless someone complains.<br>
<p>
Would PPL's be the same way? Lots of house rules? And how would PPLs<br>
deal with differences in personality (e.g., aggressive and more<br>
passive people or even better the ones who are very reasonable and the<br>
ones that are not.)<br>
<p>
Would PPL's have a internal Jury's.. (e.g., "mr Hawk we will you drop<br>
from the PPL if you don't remove the 'kill all English majors' bumper<br>
sticker from your car" vs some other PPL member w/ a bumper sticker<br>
that might say, "English is a stupid way of speaking."<br>
<p>
Ultimate we know there are many shades of grey and that people often<br>
has little incentive to be reasonable and that it can even be hard to<br>
agree on what is reasonable and what is not.<br>
<p>
One last point: A Roman Catholic PPL with the Pope is charge and 100's<br>
of years of written theology to backup and help direct the PPL might<br>
have some strong advantages cost wise over a NEW PPL that ExI might<br>
run. As an exercise try to think of the various advantages and<br>
disadvantages an RC Church vs ExI PPL might have.<br>
<p>
Thanks for you time,<br>
