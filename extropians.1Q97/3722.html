<i>&gt;   "Popper stood all this on its head.  In his philosophy of science, we</i><br>
<i>&gt; find the curious thought that falsifiability, not verifiability, is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguishing mark of scientific theories; this means that, for Popper,</i><br>
<i>&gt; one theory is better than another if it is more disprovable than the other.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Popper was apparently fond of referring to 'the soaring edifice of</i><br>
<i>&gt; science.'  But in fact his philosophy of science robbed that edifice of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; foundation.  Refracted through the lens of Popper's theories, the history</i><br>
<i>&gt; of modern science is transformed from a dazzling string of successes into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; series of 'problems' or 'conjectures and refutations.'  On the traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt; view, scientific knowledge can be said to be *cumulative*:  we know more</i><br>
<i>&gt; now than we did in 1897, more then than in 1697.  Popper's theory, demoting</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientific laws to mere guesses, denies this:  in one of his most famous</i><br>
<i>&gt; phrases, he speaks of science as 'conjectural knowledge,' an oxymoronic gem</i><br>
<i>&gt; that, as Stove remarks, makes as much sense as 'a drawn game which was won.'"</i><br>
<p>
This is insufferable misinterpretation of Popper, and with no excuse given<br>
other than Stove's own emotional discomfort with carefully reasoned ideas.<br>
The "foundation" metaphor of science is empty rhetoric; Popper /expanded/<br>
the grand edifice of science by refusing to tie its future to the failures<br>
of imagination of those past.  To strain the metaphor, Mr. Stove wants a<br>
solid foundation, but refuses to allow science to build on land outside it,<br>
or to tear it down when it is found inadequate, or to change our very<br>
methods of building when better ones are found.<br>
<p>
Mr. Stove seems uncomfortable with the obvious fact that expanding<br>
knowledge implies expanding ignorance.  We all experience this directly<br>
in our lives; the more we learn, the more we realize how much more there<br>
is that we haven't learned; the more capable our imaginations become of<br>
seeing outside our earlier unwarranted naive certainty.  Mr. Stove's<br>
discomfort with "conjectural knowledge" is merely cowardice: he doesn't<br>
want to admit that every act taken by every human being is a gamble on<br>
the efficacy of what we call knowledge.  He seems dismayed by that<br>
rather than enlivened and freed.  That's /his/ failure, not Popper's.<br>
