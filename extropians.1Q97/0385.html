You basically seem to be talking about digital cash, which has been<br>
available on the Net for several years. The only difference is that in<br>
your system multiple issuers would issue the same cash with a variable<br>
exchange rate to the local currency, whereas the systems out there issue<br>
different forms of digital cash to represent each foreign currency. I<br>
don't think many people would trust your system as any ISP could issue an<br>
infinite amount of cash without charging for it and undermine the entire<br>
economy. With multiple currencies they would only harm themselves. <br>
<p>
We tried to set up something like this with the original test cash that<br>
Digicash issued; there was only one issuer and we created a market such<br>
that people could bid to buy and sell their 'cyberbucks' for any real<br>
currency that they desired. With more people in the market it might have<br>
worked, but only a few transactions were reported. Even so, I suspect that<br>
this is the way to go, with multiple currencies and multiple currency<br>
exchange markets. <br>
<p>
If you want to play around with digital cash, then look in 'Applied<br>
Cryptography' or hunt down the 'Magic Money' software on the Net (if<br>
nowhere else it's on utopia.hacktic.nl under /pub/crypto). The software is<br>
patent-infringing in numerous countries, but it will show you how these<br>
things work. <br>
