Dear RavnStCrow (?),<br>
<p>
In a message dated 97-03-03 09:42:19 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
Or more accurately you copied part of my post...<br>
 <br>
 &lt;&lt; am very interested in extropic ideas.  <br>
  BTW, I am a "card-carrying" Libertarian, signed up with ALCOR for cryonic<br>
  suspension, (went to ACT festival, in fact...it was great!), and <br>
  a 100% skeptical, scientifically oriented superstition hating<br>
  athiest/agnostic.  <br>
<i>   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
 &lt;um....<br>
 is this the official Extropic defintion?<br>
 ; )&gt;<br>
<p>
Thanks for question/observation (?).  No, I would not say that I am<br>
"officially" anything!:) <br>
I certainly would not want a lot of wonderful and skeptical people who do not<br>
happen to share my views on cryonic suspension or religion to think they are<br>
"Outside" of extropian ideas.  Or will be kicked out of the party! :)<br>
<p>
I like the orientation that Extropy has in a number of areas.  Including the<br>
pretty clear cut fact, IMHO, that most progress we as a race have made has<br>
been a result of increasing technology.  Not new versions of old<br>
superstitions called religions.<br>
<p>
Which does not mean there are not some wonderful, kind, thoughtful people<br>
deeply involved in all sorts of religions.  I just happen to believe that<br>
they would be "good" people anyway.  They are basically decent, in other<br>
words, *despite* their particular brand of superstition, not *because* of it.<br>
<p>
I could be wrong.  I have been wrong about a bunch of things in the past, and<br>
it has toned down my natural arrogance a bit!:)<br>
<p>
Onwards and Upwards,<br>
<p>
Rudi<br>
