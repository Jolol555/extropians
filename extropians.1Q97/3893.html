INTRO (02/08/97). Way back around 26 Sep 96, in a post re 'Markov Chains<br>
can Remember and Plan too', I naively questioned the ability of<br>
state-transition models to describe the complex biological world in any<br>
complete way. Despite the learned rebuffs, I still had this intuitive<br>
feeling that the classical mechanical models, including Turing machines,<br>
were inadequate for describing biological organisms, in particular human<br>
minds. I resolved to find some way of more formally stating what I<br>
sensed. Reading and (most importantly) summarizing Robert Rosen's 1991<br>
book _Life Itself_ from the Columbia University Complexity in Ecological<br>
Systems series has helped me formalize some of the system theoretical<br>
concepts I was looking for. Progress has been slow, however...<br>
<p>
01/10/97. SOCIETIES OF TURING MACHINES. Anders Sandberg responded to my<br>
query about societies of Turing machines by saying that, in principle,<br>
these are equivalent to "one big TM", but in practice "it is probably<br>
possible to prove that in general it is impossible to predict the<br>
resulting behavior of a society of agents from the agent programs<br>
themselves."<br>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker also replied suggesting that what I was talking about<br>
could still be *simulated* by _a_ TM simulating a society of TMs. But,<br>
I'm not sure whether such a simulation could be conducted by a single<br>
entity or closed system. Perhaps a real-time, dynamic society of<br>
independent agents that come and go of their own 'free will' and,<br>
therefore, probably cannot be represented by any single model, is<br>
necessary. It was my suspicion that an asynchronous network or ensemble<br>
of independently constructed agents operates differently from and cannot<br>
be described by any pre-defined (logically-planned) Turing machine.<br>
(This cuts to the heart of a major debate among Transhumanists as to<br>
whether evolution is "stupid" or, perhaps, more creative somehow than<br>
any logic-based approach.)<br>
<p>
Recently (03/14/97), Eugene Leitl posted (&gt;H List) about the First<br>
International Conference on UNCONVENTIONAL MODELS OF COMPUTATION CDMTCS<br>
to be held in Auckland, New Zealand, in 9801, with a host of invited<br>
speakers from the top ranks of computer science and complexity theory,<br>
the goal of which is to explore "all areas of unconventional<br>
computation, especially in quantum computing, computing using organic<br>
molecules (DNA), and various proposals for computation that go beyond<br>
the Turing model."<br>
<p>
The following notes may provide some useful background for this<br>
unconventional approach by exploring mathematical biophysics and<br>
relational biology as described by Robert Rosen.<br>
<p>
01/11/97. Finally obtained and started to read Robert Rosen's _Life<br>
Itself_: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and<br>
Fabrication of Life_, finding that the issues he deals with are at the<br>
core of recent Extropians discussions. The essence of Rosen's radical<br>
argument is this: "What if physics is the particular, and biology the<br>
general, instead of the other way around? If this is so, then nothing in<br>
contemporary science will remain the same."<br>
<p>
(03/22/97 summary of praeludium &amp; ch.1) Rosen sketches the extremes: In<br>
the strong reductionist corner he cites Ernest Rutherford's "qualitative<br>
is /nothing but/ poor quantitative"; and, on the 'fuzzy' side, he cites<br>
Robert Hutchins', "a social scientist is a person who counts telephone<br>
poles". Rosen says that Hutchins' "soft science" view concludes that<br>
"reductionism is wrong in principle" and declares: "Hutchins is<br>
inverting Rutherford's dictum; he is asserting that quantitative is poor<br>
qualitative." Rosen plans to plot a course between these two stormy<br>
shoals, relying on mathematics and relational biophysics for his<br>
navigation.<br>
<p>
Rosen finishes his 'praeludium" by citing 2 central issues he plans to<br>
deal with: syntax vs. semantics, and Godel's theorem's and Turing<br>
machine's relevance to complex systems. Rosen notes that Rutherford's<br>
position "can be rephrased as asserting that /every material system is a<br>
simple system/", and adds that "this position is just another form of<br>
Church's Thesis". Rosen concludes here by noting: "it seems to me that<br>
the duality between 'hard' or quantitative science and 'soft' or<br>
qualitative science rests entirely on a false presumption". It is the<br>
nature of this "false presumption" that he plans to explore through<br>
_Life Itself_.<br>
<p>
Ch.1 is called "Prolegomena" and starts off by referring to Rosen's two<br>
previous works for which this is the culmination: _Fundamentals of<br>
Measurement and the Representation of Natural Systems_ (no date given)<br>
and _Anticipatory Systems_ (1985). <br>
<p>
Rosen begins by asking (1A) "What is Life?". Rosen declares: "Life is<br>
material, but the laws framed to describe the properties of matter give<br>
no purchase on life. Something is missing here, perhaps something<br>
essential for the understanding of matter in general." Rosen's goal is<br>
to construct "a language appropriate for a physics of 'organized<br>
matter', a physics of complex systems." <br>
<p>
In ch.1B, "Why the Problem is Hard", Rosen addresses causality and the<br>
curious situation where, in the past, "biology has generally had to<br>
parasitize other sciences in order to develop its own experimental<br>
techniques". He laments that "biology, has as yet no objectively<br>
definable bounds." Ch.1C specifically worries about "The Machine<br>
Metaphor in Biology", beginning with Descartes conclusion that "life<br>
itself was automaton-like", which has today been elaborated into the<br>
notion of molecular machines. But, when we're dealing with life and<br>
other complex systems, Rosen concludes that "we cannot expect<br>
[reductionism] to solve both the physiological and the fabrication<br>
problem simultaneously". He conludes ch.1 by saying: "I hope to convince<br>
the reader ... that the machine metaphor is not just a little bit wrong;<br>
it is entirely wrong and must be discarded."<br>
<p>
01/12/97. In ch.2 of _Life Itself_ Rosen dives right into "Strategic<br>
Considerations: The Special and the General" where he declares that<br>
"once we have imposed an additional structure on a set, be it of an<br>
algebraic, topological, or any other character, the mappings we use to<br>
compare one such structure with another must, of course, respect that<br>
structure.... The set of continuous mappings from one topological space<br>
to another is thus generally much smaller than the totallity of<br>
unrestricted mappings between their underlying sets. It is on this level<br>
that the restrictive nature of the additional structure manifests<br>
itself." <br>
<p>
(03/12/97 annotation after reading on Extropians about "Countertime<br>
Beings": I would venture to say that it is this sort of situation that<br>
Rosen has just described, rather than some cosmic "time-reversal<br>
symmmetry", that might really underlie the transactional interpretation<br>
of quantum physics.)<br>
<p>
In 2B, "From General to Special", Rosen describes the discovery of<br>
infinite arithmetic, the 'foundation crises' of mathematics and the<br>
question of "how to restrict ourselves to those infinite sums and<br>
products that 'make sense' and avoid those that do not. The resolution<br>
of this crisis was given by Cauchy, who in 1805 introduced the necessary<br>
concept, /convergence/", which, says Rosen, is associated with the<br>
concept of /continuity/.<br>
<p>
In 2C, "From Special to General", Rosen relates the discovery of<br>
non-Euclidean geometry, and the roughly simultaneous 'insecurities' in<br>
theoretical physics, particularly electrodynamics, that eventually<br>
resulted in Einstein's /Special Relativity/ constituting "a<br>
generalization of Newtonian mechanics", along with Heisenberg<br>
Uncertainty which led to today's quantum mechanics. Rosen concludes this<br>
section by noting: "Ordinary ('proper') functions turn out to be a very<br>
special case, and the more general objects (originally called<br>
/distributions/) are identifiable with limits of sequences of these<br>
'proper' functions, just as real numbers are limits of sequences of<br>
rationals. Thus, from this point of view, distributions /generalize/<br>
ordinary functions; the generalization embeds ordinary functions in a<br>
new and larger universe, in which they are nongeneric indeed... The<br>
elements of this larger world may have new and different properties from<br>
those with which we started; properties generic in the large world but<br>
vacuous in the small one that gave rise to them."<br>
<p>
01/12/97. In 2D, on "Induction and Deduction", Rosen describes how<br>
"induction, roughly, seeks to establish general (i.e., quantified)<br>
propositions on the basis of instances; deduction, conversely seeks to<br>
establish instances in terms of quantified or general propositions."<br>
Rosen describes predicates, or properties, and assertions about sets as<br>
strings of conjunctive properties. Induction is traditionally considered<br>
more difficult and, Rosen adds, "without additional structure, the<br>
problem of induction cannot be solved in general; that much was<br>
originally pointed out by Aristotle ... and elevated by Hume into a<br>
complete rejection of empiricism [by which is meant] the establishment<br>
of general truth by judicious sampling." "The further structure<br>
necessary", says Rosen, is that "if P, as a property, itself manifests<br>
what we may call contagion, so that the truth of P(Xi) itself implies<br>
the truth of P(Xj) ... then the problem of induction can be dealt<br>
with.... Mathematical induction is, in fact, all we need to generate the<br>
whole of Number Theory from the existence of the number '1', and the<br>
ability to 'add 1' to any integer... This idea ... permeates both<br>
science and mathematics in profound and insufficiently appreciated<br>
ways."<br>
<p>
Ch.2E, "On the Generality of Physics", Rosen proposes that Godel's<br>
undecidability proofs are 'contagious' beyond Number Theory because to<br>
assess the generality of any formalism is to raise a metatheoretic<br>
"question about the theory, not a question within the theory." This is<br>
why, Rosen declares, "reductionism, rests on faith." Rosen concludes:<br>
"with respect to biological phenomena, contemporary physics is in<br>
exactly the same situation that 19th-century physics faced in the atomic<br>
and cosmological realms: it either stands mute or it gives the wrong<br>
answers.... Once again, as in all similar situations in the past, the<br>
claim is that purely technical matters are involved and that the problem<br>
is simply one of specializing what already exists in an appropriate way.<br>
But history shows it to be at least equally likely that the problems are<br>
not technical but conceptual, that contemporary physics remains too<br>
special to accommodate the class of material systems we call organisms."<br>
