<i>&gt; Ho wait, i didn't mean to say fraud was inherent to capitalist systems.</i><br>
<p>
You called something a "Pyramid system", and then called it capitalist.<br>
If you don't mean to imply that such a fraudulent scheme is capitalist,<br>
then don't say so.  I must assume that you mean what you say; if you<br>
don't, then there's no point arguing with you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; isn't relying on companies who commit fraud today on a daily basis, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect you from fraud when payed, a little naive ? </i><br>
<p>
I honestly don't have the slightest clue what you're trying to say here.<br>
Tie this to reality for me: name names, give examples, show me what you<br>
mean.  I'd really like to have an idea what's going on inside your head,<br>
but these words don't help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The main concern i still have with a complete free market, stateless system</i><br>
<i>&gt; is social stability, which i believe is just as important for a growing</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy as a free market. Just thought a current example migth give more</i><br>
<i>&gt; insight in these matters. Guess it was a little too controversial ? ;-) </i><br>
<p>
Fuck Stability.  Value Life.<br>
