Well, that's Norway. Can you guess why so many swedes are jealous of the <br>
oil and wealth, despite that you didn't enter the EEC? :-)<br>

Social democracy is not evil or stupid per se, but as you point out it is<br>
practically impossible to oppose since it is so well-meaning, and it seems<br>
to have an innate tendency towards stupidity. My libertarian friends of<br>
course claim it has all sorts of dark designs, but I fear that much of it<br>
actually means what it says, which is far worse. <br>

I'm not entirely sure the US is the best choice either (sorry to all you<br>
americans), to me its future stability looks a bit uncertain. I have this<br>
feeling that soon the east Asia will be the place to emigrate to. Yes, I'm<br>
myself planning to become more international as soon as I can. As one of<br>
my friens said: "If I'm not in Brussels in ten years, I have failed<br>
completely!" <br>
