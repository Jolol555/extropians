Carl Feynman suggested:<br>

<i>&gt;under current circumstances.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Under the hunter-gatherer conditions in which our ancestors lived for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;past seven million years, a typical person only knew a hundred or so other</i><br>
<i>&gt;people.  Half of those were kids, and half the adults were stupider than</i><br>
<i>&gt;average.  The chance of coming up with a good idea that nobody else had</i><br>
<i>&gt;thought of was much higher than it is today.  </i><br>
<p>
Curt Adams responded:<br>
<i>&gt;But all the adults were citing the accumulated knowledge of centuries or even</i><br>
<i>&gt;millenia.  The Australian aborigines' Dreamtime techniques have apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt;preserved knowledge of geographical features from the last Ice Age. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;The punishment for a wrong idea was much more likely to be death.  In our</i><br>
<i>&gt;benign society you can make a lot of boo-boos and come out OK.  Without</i><br>
<p>
Robert Schrader also responded:<br>
<i>&gt;2) Usable-idea space is so much larger now than then, the proportions</i><br>
<i>&gt;may actually be the reverse of what you suggest.</i><br>
<p>
The Low Golden Willow replied:<br>
<i>&gt;On the other hand, the punishment for not being inventive in a hostile</i><br>
<i>&gt;environment can _also_ be death.  </i><br>
<p>
There are many interesting related issues here, but most of these<br>
considerations are irrelevant to the puzzle I was talkikng about.  To<br>
get the prediction of agreement, you need the two sides to know that<br>
the others disagree, and in which direction.  Punishment and<br>
idea-space sizes are irrelevant, as are scenarios where you both know<br>
someone else knows something you don't, such as good food plants.<br>
Also irrelevant is disagreeing with people in the past, who certainly<br>
can't know that you disagree with them.<br>
<p>
The size of the population who disagrees is relevant, but our<br>
ancestors did have to deal with beliefs communities of varying sizes,<br>
so they presumably learned to condition their strategies on this<br>
context, though the max size they ever dealt with is much smaller than<br>
for us.<br>
<p>
I'd be more tempted to look at evolutionary strategies for pretending<br>
to disagree when you really didn't, in order to promote information<br>
aggregation, take credit for originating discoveries and to<br>
demonstrate strength of character.<br>
