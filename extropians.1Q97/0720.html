Stuart A. Kauffman, "The Origins of Order", Oxford University Press<br>
(1993), p 34, 461.<br>

[...]<br>
Among the most obvious features of cell differentiation is that less<br>
complex organisms possess fewer cell types than more complex organisms.<br>
For example, yeast has three cell types, the coelenterate hydra has 15 to<br>
17, annelid worms have about 60, and humans about 250. A plot of the<br>
number of cell types in an organism as a function of the estimated number<br>
of genes in that organism shows a profound and simple relation: The<br>
number of cell types increases as about a square-root function of the<br>
number of the genes [...]. Why should such a remarkably simple relation<br>
exist across such a wide range of phyla? Yeast, hydra, annelides, and<br>
vertebrates diverged around 600 million years ago. It is hard to believe<br>
that such a relationship is a heritable remnant of a property derived from<br>
a primitive archaen ancestor in the Cambrian or Precambrian as a result<br>
of propinquity of descent. Perhaps instead selection has directly opted<br>
for this property? Perhaps not. I shall argue that this strong<br>
corellation across many phyla is an indirect and virtually inevitable<br>
property of the kinds of cybernetic gene-regulatory systems which<br>
control cell differentiation and ontogeny. [...]<br>
Simple organisms have fewer cell types than complex organisms. For<br>
example, yeast has three, as distinguished above. Bacteria may have two:<br>
vegetative and spore forms. The mold Neurospera has about five [...]. By<br>
similiar criteria, the hydra, a simple coelenterate, has 13 to 15 [...],<br>
as do sponges [...]. Jellyfish are more complex, with perhaps 20 to 30<br>
cell types [...]. Annelids have about 60 cell types [...], and adult<br>
humans about 254 [...]. Therefore, there must be some simple relation<br>
between the number of genes in an organism, and the number of its cell<br>
types. If it is hard to count numbers of cell types, it is also hard to<br>
count the number of genes. The simplest way to count genes is to count<br>
total DNA per cell, a not too unreasonable choice. [...]<br>
<p>
In [...], I show a graph if the number of cell types, based on<br>
histological criteria, versus the total DNA content per cell, across a<br>
wide range of phyla. The data, on a log-log plot, are quite close to<br>
linear, indicating that the corellation between amount of DNA and number<br>
of cell types is a power law. Specifically, the data suggest that the<br>
number of cell types in an organism is crudely proportional to the square<br>
root of the DNA content per cell. This means that, in evolution, adding<br>
the next cell type has required ever greater amounts of DNA. Suppose<br>
instead that we consider, for any organism, the number of cell types<br>
versus the estimated number of RNA sequences transcribed in that<br>
organism. Thus for yeast, the estimated number of cell types is 3 and the<br>
number of transcribed genes is 4000. In Drosophila, as in annelids, the<br>
number of cell types might be about 60 and the transcribed complexity<br>
about 17000. In humans the number of cell types is 200 to 300 and the<br>
transcribed complexity is about 100000. Thus on the basis of measured<br>
complexity of RNA sequences, the number of cell types increases roughly<br>
linearly with, or perhaps a bit faster than, the number of genes. It<br>
certainly does not increase much more rapidly than linearly. That is, the<br>
number of cell types does not increase as the number of genes squared or<br>
as an exponential function of the number of genes. Since total DNA is an<br>
overestimate of the number of genes and transcribed complexity is an<br>
underestimate, we might safely guess that the true relation is somewhat<br>
less than linear. This statement says that, in evolution, progressively<br>
more genes are requred for each additional cell type. Although it fits<br>
the general notion that more regulatory genes are needed to coordinate<br>
gene expression, this image is quite naive. It is trivial to construct<br>
model genetic networks in which the number of model cell types increases<br>
_exponentially_ as the number of genes increases. Exponential growth is<br>
faster than any power law.<br>
<p>
In short, it is very much a nontrivial observation, across many phyla,<br>
that the number of cell types increases at something like a linear or<br>
square-root function of the total number of genes in an organism.<br>
Obviously, we would like to know why that might be true. And we might<br>
begin to wonder whether a property such as this splayed across many<br>
phyla, represents selection or some deeper feature of genome regulatory<br>
system. [...]<br>
