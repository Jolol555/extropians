  I think it all depends on the security of the application.<br>
We all allow third parties (banks, mutual funds, etc.) to play<br>
with our money while we are not using it, and find it both<br>
more profitable and safer than just sitting on cash.<br>
<p>
Eugene Leitl suggested that charging for browsing and payments<br>
for usage of resources should be connected only thru the user's<br>
wallet, and I agree with it.  So there can be a few sites that can<br>
distribute the code - you connect to them before, during, or after<br>
other sessions, and your machine executes code while on-line, or not.<br>
The payments can be different - they can go to your bank account, or<br>
you get NetCredits for buying things online, or you get enrolled into<br>
a lottery with *good* chances to win a new super-PC or a cash prize.<br>
Your machine can develop Alife critters, or improve chess algorithms.<br>
If you work in your office on some low-security stuff, like designing<br>
brochures or proof-reading students' homework, you will probably not<br>
lose much by letting it evolve some cellular automata when you are not<br>
using the machine anyway, and periodically communicate the results<br>
back to the server (forget JavaScripts). In return, you will get enough<br>
payments to offset your offline bills, and occasionally buy a new<br>
peripheral for your computer. Or, if you want, you can donate all the<br>
profits to the Libertarian party.  Besides, if your PC evolves something<br>
interesting, your face may appear in some magazine.<br>
<p>
  Whether Hara Ra is right considering this a security breach, is actually<br>
beside the point, just as opinions of many people on using Netscape cookies<br>
or lending their possessions to others.  The question is, will *some* people<br>
trust the system enough to decide that the benefits are worth the risks?<br>
I'd say there will be such people.<br>
<p>
Now, if we accept very conservative estimates of the number of such people and<br>
the utility of their computers - at 10% of PCs(that's 10 million PCs) and $10<br>
a month, we have a billion dollar a year market.  That seems attractive enough<br>
to develop the system, resolve many security issues and prepare the market for<br>
expansion, by an order of magnitude - or two.<br>
<p>
An interesting question is how the government can tax your earnings.<br>
Deducting them from the price of PC ownership seems too much hassle -<br>
then every computer owner would be registered as a small entrepreneur.<br>
<p>
If you tax only big companies, and only at a point of converting<br>
NetCredits into conventional currency, then we have a huge liquid market<br>
of new currency that has never been taxed.  Your earn it on-line, spend<br>
it on-line, and accumulate it online.  It is possible, of course, to<br>
micro-tax micro-transactions, but then the government will have to write<br>
efficient taxing agent software, and that will probably not happen very soon.<br>
