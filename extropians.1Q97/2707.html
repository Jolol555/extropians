I originally wrote: But as more nations shed the shackles of socialism <br>
and mercantilism, as seems to be the trend, shouldn't they too begin <br>
to approach the capital appreciation rates experienced in the U.S.?<br>
<p>
And Robin Hanson replied:<br>
&lt;That's the positive interpretation.  Let's hope its true.  Note the <br>
implication though:  Most capitalists have never appreciated the value <br>
of free markets, or they would have invested here instead of <br>
elsewhere.&gt;<br>
<p>
Then I questioned: Hmmm, why should they distinguish here from there? <br>
Must adventurers always be judged as pirates just because they see <br>
easier pickings over the uncharted horizon?<br>
<p>
And, on Tuesday, February 18, 1997 12:43 PM, you wrote:<br>
&lt;You've lost me here.  Investors should move to where the expect <br>
higher returns, just as people should move to where wages are highest. <br>
 I don't see a relation between this and piracy.&gt;<br>
<p>
Sorry for going poetic and rambling romantically about pirates and <br>
such - I really wanted to refer to pioneers rather than bucaneers.<br>
<p>
Your response clarifies that you meant (I think) that investors should <br>
have been investing here in the U.S., rather than overseas, because <br>
that's where they could get the highest returns.<br>
<p>
It seems to me, though, that investors like to diversify.  Even if <br>
they know (and it's doubtful that they had the kind of quantified <br>
knowledge of comparative investment returns in major world markets <br>
that the study you cited  provided) where to get the best return, they <br>
might not want to put all their eggs in one basket.  I would think <br>
this overseas "adventurism", despite more assured investments at home, <br>
implies that investors aren't always completely rational, that they <br>
are willing to take risks and be pioneers in new markets.<br>
<p>
I was organizing some of my note files over the weekend and found this <br>
item that might have some relevance here:<br>
<p>
&lt;06/06/96. RATIONAL BEHAVIOR. Roger Lowenstein's WSJ "Intrinsic Value" <br>
column describes the work of the late Israeli psychologist Amos <br>
Tversky at challenging the economics assumption of rational behavior. <br>
Tversky showed that people exhibit 'loss aversion', the desire to find <br>
patterns in random events and comparative evaluations that do not <br>
usually produce rational behavior.&gt;<br>
<p>
I don't know if Tversky or others have also shown that people act <br>
irrationally when they are willing to take risks in new areas.<br>
