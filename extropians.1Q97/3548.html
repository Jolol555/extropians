With current methods of cloning you still need a mother, but their are  <br>
probably other ways to do it. Standard recipe to  clone a human:<br>
<p>
1) Take an egg cell from a female and remove all the DNA from the nucleus.<br>
2) Take a cell, any cell except a red blood cell, from the person you want to   <br>
   clone and put it in a test tube for 5 days.<br>
3) Only feed the cell 5% of the food it normally uses so it goes into a state   <br>
   of quiescence. <br>
4) Place the sleeping cell next to the egg that has been robedof its DNA.<br>
5) Give the 2 cells a small jolt of electricity so they merge and watch them   <br>
   divide.<br>
6) When they reach the 8 or 16 cell stage transfer them to the womb of the   <br>
   host mother.<br>
7) Wait 9 months.<br>
<p>
Sperm is in no way involved in any of this, as far as test tube reproduction <br>
is concerned men are as obsolete as vacuum tubes. Perhaps women are not <br>
needed either, an animal's womb might work, already horses have given birth  <br>
to test tube zebras. As for a human egg cell, as many as 7 million could be <br>
gotten from the ovaries of a human female embryo, John Eppig at the Jackson <br>
Laboratory in Bar Harbor Maine has done it in mice. A human egg might not <br>
even be needed, in an editorial in the same issue of "Nature" that announced <br>
the cloning results, they say it would be interesting to know if a human egg <br>
cell is really needed to clone a person, one from an animal such as a cow  <br>
might work. Of course, then the human clone would have cow mitochondria DNA, <br>
but that might not be a problem.<br>
<p>
The Senate hearing on cloning was on C-span today, with one exception <br>
everyone was screaming about how evil human cloning would be, even Ian Wilmut, <br>
the man who invented the technique. By far the most interesting remarks came <br>
from Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, he said he disagreed with the <br>
president's decree on this subject and he didn't think he had the <br>
constitutional authority to do it, then he said:<br>
<p>
 "This has enormous potential for good, There should be no limits on human  <br>
  knowledge, none whatever. To those like President Clinton who say we can't   <br>
  play God, I say OK, fine, you can take your side alongside Pope Paul V who <br>
  in 1616 tried to stop Galileo, they accused Galileo of trying to play God <br>
  too. [...] I don't think cloning is demeaning to human nature, to attempt   <br>
  to limit human knowledge is demeaning. It's not legitimate to try to stop  <br>
  cloning. What nonsense, what utter, utter nonsense to think we can hold   <br>
  up our hand and just say "stop". Cloning will continue, the human mind will  <br>
  continue to inquire into it. Human cloning will take place and it will take <br>
  place in my lifetime, and I don't fear it at all. I want to be on the side  <br>
  of the Galileos and those who say the human mind has no limits, rather than  <br>
  trying to stop something that's going to happen anyway."<br>
<p>
I has a strange feeling when I head him talk, it was like the words were <br>
coming out of my mouth, it made me think about how important genes are to <br>
personality, for although I have never said one word to the man and have  <br>
never even seen him in person, Senator Harkin is my cousin.<br>
<p>
My Mom always said Harkin's father was the stupidest man in the family and a <br>
total embarrassment. Surprisingly despite these excellent qualifications he <br>
did not go into politics, but his son did. That branch of the family still <br>
causes me embarrassment, I don't like being related to a politician, but I<br>
must admit he made me proud today.           <br>
