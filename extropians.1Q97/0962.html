My, quite a discussion we've got going here...<br>
<p>
As I've said, I totally agree with those of you who have pointed out the<br>
merits of logic and the flaws in dogmatism.  The problem that I'm<br>
pondering is this:  if we're right, and rationalism is so much better<br>
than dogmatism, then why haven't we beaten it already?  My concern is<br>
that despite our intelligence, we've somehow grossly miscalculated our<br>
advantage.  As far as I can see it, reason should ALREADY be the status<br>
quo, due to the advantages that we've already listed.  I don't mean that<br>
it ethically ought to be the law of the land, but rather, due to its<br>
generally agreed upon memetic fitness, its strengths should already have<br>
surpassed the weaknesses of the oppressor.<br>
<p>
However, as we're all aware, we're NOT in charge, at least not yet.  The<br>
memes which should be dead aren't:  The Bible is the most widely<br>
published text on Earth, intellectualism is shunned as "bullshit," and<br>
good ideas are withering at the hands of the devotedly closed minded. <br>
This is incomprehensible to me; there doesn't seem to be a memetic basis<br>
for this data... UNLESS the worst is true and the dogma is indeed far<br>
stronger than our understanding of memetic biology would allow it.<br>
<p>
I guess my question isn't "How can we win?" but rather, "Why haven't we<br>
won?"<br>
