In a message dated 3/16/97 8:18:50 PM, Sarah Marr wrote that my professed<br>
bemusement with sweeping claims (by unnamed parties) about "Extropic art",<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;seems to imply that I made such a claim.</i><br>
<p>
This looks like a good example of the variance between a sender's intent and<br>
a receiver's interpretation!  I in fact concur with Sarah's argument that,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;since interpretation is observer dependent, []</i><br>
<i>&gt;sweeping claims cannot be made except as statements of intent on the part</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Extropian artists.</i><br>
<p>
One corollary of the indeterminancy of interpretation:  "Extropic art" (if<br>
defined by content) can come from decidedly non-Extropian sources.  (Beauty<br>
in the beholder's eye, and all that.)<br>
<p>
Another corollary:  A self-proclaimed "Extropic artist" could (under the same<br>
definition) produce decidedly entropic art.  All too often, artists fail to<br>
communicate what they intend.<br>
<p>
These observations undergird my uneasiness with a content- or intent-based<br>
definition of Extropian art.  Such a definition operates in the same way that<br>
"Christian art" might; it comes uncomfortably close to describing propaganda.<br>
<p>
Now, I like effective rhetoric as much as the next rabble-rouser.  Many types<br>
of art, however, simply do not lend themselves to predictable<br>
interpretations, and thus do not work well as propaganda.  Compare a dance to<br>
an essay.  So a content- or intent-based definition of Extropian art will not<br>
prove useful for many modes of communication.<br>
<p>
Compare that sort of definition with one based on the community that gives<br>
rise to the art--"Christian art" versus "American art", say.  Such a<br>
definition loosely defines content, and yet avoids the possibly censorious<br>
consequences of a content- or intent-based definition.  "American art" loses<br>
nothing by attacking American institutions.  Such criticism characterizes the<br>
community of artists in question.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying I embrace the definition-by-community view; I just wanted to<br>
point out an alternative to the content- or intent-based definition.<br>
 Personally, I think that trying to define art accomplishes embarassingly<br>
little.  Far better to just create it, share it, and enjoy it.<br>
