I understand why you would say this, but whenever I hear this view it makes<br>
me choke! Confusing the boundaries of religion and science only plays into<br>
the hands of those who want to maintain their irrational approaches to<br>
thinking.<br>
<p>
No, religion is definitely not the foundation of science, and faith has no<br>
role in science. I do agree that, in a developmental sense, religion has<br>
come before science. The progression: religion -- philosophy -- science<br>
often is real. However, this does not make religion the *foundation* of<br>
science. Certain concerns, such as the nature of the heavens, may start as<br>
the province of religion since people have too little information and may<br>
appeal to dogmas to decide what's up there. Once more systematic thinking<br>
appears, philosophy may take over. Once philosophy has clarified the<br>
problem and once more information is available (i.e. testable observations<br>
become possible) the problem can enter the realm of science.<br>
<p>
Yes, science at any point may involve suppositions or axioms or precepts<br>
that are not proven. This is because nothing is *provable* in science, only<br>
refutable. How is this different from faith? It differs in an extremely<br>
important way: In a faith, the precepts may not be challenged. They are<br>
fixed and absolute. In science (and in rationality in general), all<br>
suppositions are open to challenge.<br>
<p>
You might read Karl Popper or W.W. Bartley III on this, or a shorter<br>
version: my EXTRO 1 essay "Pancritical Rationalism: An Extropic Metacontext<br>
for Memetic Progress: which is on the web at:<br>
