Police Identify Bodies from Mass Suicide<br>
<p>
RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. (Reuter) - Police investigating the mass suicide <br>
of 39 cult members said Thursday they have identified all<br>
of the bodies but were not releasing the names of the dead until they <br>
notified relatives. <br>
<p>
"We know who they are," Sgt. R.H. Morse told reporters outside the <br>
million-dollar mansion in this exclusive community near San<br>
Diego. <br>
<p>
Some 30 detectives and crime laboratory technicians from the San Diego <br>
Sheriff's Department were working on the case, and experts<br>
from the Los Angeles Coroner's Office were helping. <br>
<p>
The group members apparently committed suicide in the belief a UFO, <br>
shielded behind a comet, would take them to heaven. <br>
<p>
Police said the men and women, dressed alike and with their hair in buzz <br>
cuts, appeared to have died from drug overdoses in a carefully<br>
planned mass suicide over several days. <br>
<p>
"We also were able to determine, based on their physical appearance and <br>
some of the characteristics of their bodies and liquid found at<br>
the scene, that they may have ingested drugs," Lt. Gerald Lipscomb of the <br>
San Diego County Sheriff's Department told CNN. <br>
<p>
Lipscomb said the suicides, discovered Wednesday in a luxury mansion in <br>
Rancho Santa Fe, north of San Diego, may have taken place<br>
over seven days. He said all of the victims did not appear to have died <br>
at the same time. <br>
<p>
San Diego County Coroner's Office spokesman Chuck Bolton said the <br>
identification process would take several days. <br>
<p>
In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was shocked and <br>
sickened by the deaths. <br>
<p>
"It's heartbreaking, sickening ... shocking," Clinton said when asked his <br>
reaction to the deaths, which police described as the largest<br>
mass suicide in the United States in this century. He said he did not <br>
know any more about the incident than he had seen in media<br>
reports. <br>
<p>
The bodies were discovered by Beverly Hills computer expert Nick <br>
Matzorkis and one of his employees, a former member of the<br>
group. Matzorkis said the employee, identified only as Rio, received a <br>
packet from the group Tuesday night saying its members had<br>
committed suicide. <br>
<p>
Matzorkis, owner of Interact Entertainment of Beverly Hills, told CNN the <br>
package also contained a video showing the members<br>
saying goodbye and that they appeared happy about their decision. <br>
<p>
In an interview on the NBC "Today" show, he said Rio told him he had <br>
received two videotapes and a letter from the cult. The two<br>
then drove to Rancho Santa Fe on Wednesday. <br>
<p>
"He read me the letter in the car ... and they explained that by the time <br>
this letter was being read that they will have already, as they<br>
described it, 'shed their containers,' which is I guess what they use to <br>
describe their bodies," Matzorkis said. <br>
<p>
According to the letter and the videotape, he said, the cult members <br>
believed "that they were going to be taken away by, as odd as this<br>
sounds, I'm just telling you what I heard, by a UFO, that a UFO would <br>
come by and pick them up." <br>
<p>
He said he had met about 15 members of the cult, which designed computer <br>
Internet web pages, and they told him the UFO was hiding<br>
behind the Hale-Bopp comet as it neared Earth. <br>
<p>
"They explained to me that they believed that there was a UFO following <br>
behind that comet and using it as a shield so it could not be<br>
detected by Earth and that that UFO may very well be the one to take them <br>
away," Matzorkis said. <br>
<p>
When he and Rio arrived at the $1.6-million mansion on Wednesday, he <br>
said, Rio went into the house. "When he first came out he was<br>
white as a sheet. He said 'They did it."' <br>
<p>
Matzorkis said he then contacted police in San Diego and asked them to <br>
check the house. He said the pre-suicide videotapes showed<br>
the victims "were quite jovial and excited about moving on to this next <br>
stage." <br>
<p>
In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said the FBI would be ready to <br>
help state and local law enforcement agencies in the<br>
investigation. <br>
<p>
"The FBI is working with state and local law enforcement in monitoring <br>
the situation," she told her weekly Justice Department news<br>
briefing. "I don't know whether there has been a request for assistance <br>
but we stand ready to assist, and I understand the FBI is<br>
working with state and local law enforcement," she said. <br>
<p>
Cmdr. Alan Fulmer of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said the <br>
smell was so bad that police first feared the members may<br>
have died from poison gas, but they later determined the house smelled of <br>
death. <br>
<p>
"There were no gas fumes in the house. The only smell coming out of that <br>
house was that of dead bodies," he said. <br>
<p>
Fulmer said he believed the 39, including an undetermined number of <br>
women, took their lives in a ritual that left them appearing as<br>
though they had died peacefully in their sleep. "My supposition at this <br>
point is that it was a mass suicide." <br>
<p>
He said all the victims were cloaked in purple, triangular shrouds <br>
covering their faces and chests and wore black trousers and black<br>
tennis shoes. He said they were found lying on mattresses or cots with <br>
their hands at their sides as if they had fallen asleep. <br>
<p>
No suicide notes were found and there were no signs of physical trauma, <br>
adding to the mystery surrounding the deaths. <br>
<p>
Some 30 detectives and crime laboratory technicians from the sheriff's <br>
department were working on the case, Fulmer said, and experts<br>
from the Los Angeles Coroner's Office would be joining them later. <br>
<p>
Milton Silverman, a lawyer for the owner of the house, was quoted by <br>
local TV stations as saying it had been rented to a religious<br>
computer group led by a man called "Father John" and that its members, <br>
who did not drink alcohol or smoke and were celibate,<br>
believed they were sent to America as "angels." <br>
