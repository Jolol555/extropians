In a message dated 97-01-31 15:54:43 EST, you write:<br>

&lt;&lt; &gt; Is it your opinion somehow<br>
<i> &gt; that being interested in mathematics turns you into something non-sexed,</i><br>
or<br>
<i> &gt; drains you of your attractiveness?  Or interferes with your sexuality?</i><br>
 <br>
 Yes, indeed. How many high-level mathematicians do you know? Most of them<br>
 are not attractive in the same way as Lyle's friend. Whether that's<br>
 because they're mathematicians or was true beforehand is another question. <br>
 <br>
<i> &gt; What an odd thing if you do. What does one thing have to do with another?</i><br>
 <br>
 Because, as he said, serious mathematical/science study programs you to<br>
 think in certain ways. In most cases this seems to make people more<br>
 introverted and less aware of their physical appearance. It certainly<br>
 tends to cut them off from ecstatic states, which seems to be one major<br>
 aspect of physical attraction. <br>

<p>
I tend to agree with Mark -<br>
IMO it is *rare* to see highly attractive people who have found the willpower<br>
to spend a lot of time at internal work, and maybe it's because it isnt<br>
stressed as important ( really pretty people can Do intellectual stuff, some<br>
of them anyway , with the prerequisite of hard work, but they may not NEED to<br>
perform in other ways to get approval or acceptance- whereas someone ugly may<br>
find LOTS of alone time to fill with study).<br>
