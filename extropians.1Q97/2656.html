Gregory:<br>
<p>
Whew!  That was a big 'un.  I won't go through your arguments, some of<br>
which make valid points, some of which are beside the point,as far as I<br>
am concerned.  It still seems to me that your concept of functionality<br>
is parasitic on the concept of truth.<br>
<p>
In general, as I have said, I agree with pretty much everything you say<br>
about emotional intelligence, but I think you are way off the mark in<br>
thinking that a focus on truth hinders emotional intelligence: if you<br>
want to 'delve into your subconscious', that *is* a focus on truth.<br>
<p>
The units of measurement may be arbitrary, but the measurements<br>
that we are interested in are not, and that is the whole point.  (However,<br>
the division of the body into organs is *not* arbitrary: what is<br>
arbitrary in that case is our interest in homeostasis,etc., but once our<br>
interest is in place, the organs fall into perspective as objective<br>
facts.)<br>
<p>
I don't think it would be very useful to carry on much beyond this point,<br>
as we just seem to be repeating ourselves!  <br>
