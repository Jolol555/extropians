I've looked over all the posts on this topic, and I don't have time to<br>
respond to each one in detail.  But overall I don't buy these theories:<br>
<p>
HIGH STAKES -- Maybe the max/min possible outcomes are extreme, but<br>
the expected stakes aren't out of line with other areas where people<br>
act much less confident.<br>
<p>
NOT VERIFIABLE -- There may be differences in fields in the ease of<br>
verifying claims, but politics is comparable with many other areas<br>
where people act much less confident: software/features you need for<br>
your computer, how to drive safely, psychotherapy, preventing cancer.<br>
Many of these areas have pretty high stakes, and poor ability to<br>
verify expert claims, yet people admit their ignorance and defer to<br>
others often.<br>
<p>
CONFIDENCE PERSUADES -- Yes, confidence can help persuade sometimes.<br>
But it can also make you look really stupid other times, and the issue<br>
here it to explain a differnce: Why *more* confidence in politics.<br>
<p>
These theories I consider sorta plausible:<br>
<p>
SPECIFIC IGNORNANCE -- A standard "left" view is that politics is<br>
mostly about values, and that a standard "right" view is that most<br>
people are pretty stupid.  These two views are wrong, but we can sorta<br>
understand how people who hold them might be very condident and slow<br>
to realize their error.  But political confidence has been around for<br>
quite some time; can people really be that slow?<br>
<p>
SOCIAL SPORT -- We're in a signaling game where political knowledge is<br>
taken as a sign of  intelligence and social connectedness.  So  we try<br>
to appear  knowledgeable, even if  this knowledge isn't otherwise very<br>
useful.  Hence the focus on persuasion over self-use, which encourages<br>
confidence.   Group leaders who  might  be in  a position to influence<br>
what  sort of knowledge is  used in  this signaling game believe it is<br>
good for their groups to use politics;  it helps your  interest  group<br>
get  more  benefits  vs.  other groups, and they  suppose  "democratic<br>
participation is good for democracy".<br>
<p>
A related idea is that people are trying to signal their membership in<br>
particular social groups distinguished by political "beliefs" (really<br>
verbal banners).  Typically, signaling that you are between two groups<br>
isn't such a good strategy.<br>
<p>
Some specific comments:<br>

<p>
This would argue for a differential confidence among political issues,<br>
but not for a difference between politics and say psychotherapy.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps we have a similar situation in the socio-economic policy </i><br>

<i>&gt;create laws or programs to do X in Y months", and the socio-economic </i><br>
<i>&gt;scientists can only roll their eyes and set out to gather as much data </i><br>
<i>&gt;as they can from the latest experiment.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, there is this similarity.  So the puzzle is the difference:  Most<br>
people easily admit they don't know what computer stuff to buy, and<br>
they take lots of advice from computer salesfolks.<br>
