Eliezer writes, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My objection to this whole discussion is that, scientific as it may</i><br>
<i>&gt; sound, factual as our intentions may be, ultimately you're going to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; put in the position of saying to some woman:  "You can never be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mathematical genius 'cause it ain't in your genes."  </i><br>
<p>
No.  I have never said any such thing.  As I pointed out last night:  <br>
back in October, before this discussion started, I invited QueeneMUSE <br>
to study mathematics (and I got no response at the time).  That <br>
invitation applies to everybody.  The vision is always there, for anyone <br>
who wants to pursue it.  I flatly deny that (male) mathematicians tell <br>
female students that they can't be mathematicians.  I'm not saying <br>
it never happens, but it isn't typical.  <br>
<p>
I once took a geometry course from R. L. Moore, the originator of the <br>
"Moore Method" of teaching mathematics, in which the students <br>
prove theorems instead of using textbooks.  He was a crusty old <br>
bastard, as reactionary as any man I have ever known -- defiantly racist, <br>
defiantly sexist;  you name it, he was defiantly it.  He didn't suffer fools <br>
gladly, and was combative enough to challenge men 50 years younger <br>
than himself to step outside and settle an argument with fisticuffs.  <br>
When I say defiant, I mean defiant.  <br>
<p>
There was a blind woman in the class.  Dr. Moore was 86 at the time, <br>
and starting to slip a little; it was obvious that he had to concentrate <br>
with every bit of strength left in him to lead the class.  And the blind <br>
student, of course, also had to concentrate with all her strength to <br>
visualize theorems that were difficult enough for normal students.  <br>
She wasn't a star student to begin with, and Dr. Moore might well have <br>
brushed her off and told her not to waste his time.  But no.  On the <br>
contrary.  He stayed with her every step of the way.  Whenever he <br>
introduced a new definition or a new theorem, he made sure she got it.  <br>
We, the rest of the class, could NOT move on unless that blind woman <br>
was there with us.  (Dr. Moore was like Vyaas Houston in that respect.)  <br>
Dr. Moore and the blind student, doing geometry together, both <br>
pushing themselves to their limit -- I will remember this scene as long <br>
as I live.  <br>
<p>
His last Ph.D. student, before he finally retired, was another woman, <br>
Nell Stephenson.  I don't know whatever happened to her, but at the <br>
time she got plenty of respect from her (male) peers.  She was a star <br>
student, acknowledged as such by everyone.  If some idiot had had the <br>
nerve to suggest that she couldn't be a mathematician, there would have <br>
been hell to pay from Dr. Moore, as well as from Nell herself, and <br>
all of her fellow students.  <br>
<p>
As for being a genius, she wasn't; she wasn't in the same league with <br>
Abel or Riemann.  But if she had been, that would have been fine with <br>
Dr. Moore, and fine with her fellow students -- she would have been <br>
even more of a hero in the math department than she already was.  <br>
Everybody was rooting for her.  If there were any exceptions to this, <br>
I wasn't aware of it.  <br>
<p>
My experience of mathematicians has been that they treasure every <br>
spark of intelligence they find, anywhere -- not to mention every spark <br>
of genius.  <br>
<p>
But Dr. Moore, as I say, didn't suffer fools gladly.  He had all the <br>
patience in the world with students who wanted to learn, but very little <br>
with pretentious students who expected to be treated like geniuses <br>
because of their test scores.  And I'm afraid my patience is also coming <br>
to an end.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My response is, as always, "Insufficient Data".  </i><br>
<p>
Ok.  I give up.  I put a lot of work into that post the other night.  <br>
Wasted effort.  It's time to move on to other things.  <br>
<p>
