Steve Witham:<br>

<i>&gt;Oh come on, folks, that old Star Trek nonsense?  I always wonder what</i><br>
<i>&gt;god-like measuring sticks are being used here.  Exactly how fast IS</i><br>
<i>&gt;social change supposed to go, and in what direction?  Is society's job</i><br>
<i>&gt;to ADAPT TO technology, to KEEP PACE!?</i><br>
<p>
I think that the original point being debated was far too narrow to <br>
accomodate your questions.  And no one was prescribing any particular <br>
direction society should 'go' in regards to technology.  Insofar as <br>
the broader question of the intersection between technology and <br>
social change, many new books appeared last year addressing the <br>
economic/political aspects, including Bill Gates' _The Road Ahead_, <br>
Stephen Talbott's _The Future Does Not Compute_, Negroponte's _Being <br>
Digital_, Clifford Stoll's _Silicon Snake Oil_, etc.<br>
