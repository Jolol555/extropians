We've seen structured programming.<br>
We've seen functional programming.<br>
We've seen declarative programming.<br>
<p>
<p>
We've even seen OO, though it will yet<br>
take a decade for it<br>
to truly hit the mainstream.<br>
(If it had,<br>
distributed OO realtime embedded systems<br>
wouldn't be mere lab curiosities).<br>
<p>
What cometh our way, next? Can we tell, already?<br>
<p>
And why should we care?<br>
<p>
I believe we should. Though computer monomaniacs'<br>
sensory homunculus shows habitually gross distortions<br>
of projected reality (silicon featuring prominently),<br>
the impact has been very real. More importantly, it will<br>
grow even more pronounced in the near future.<br>
<p>
If nothing else, one should know one's enemy.<br>
<p>
<p>
A trivial fact: technologies don't spring into bright bloom instantly.<br>
Usually, the TNG wonder gadgetry lurks in industry/academia<br>
labs, ogled suspiciously, for years, if not decades, before it<br>
finally flowers fully.<br>
<p>
So probably the next solution, to remedy problems which do not plague<br>
us yet, is already out there. We are curious, naturally, so what might<br>
its outlines?<br>
<p>
Since hardware and software are tightly coupled, as two spent<br>
swimmers, which do cling together, we can't expect too much<br>
from the hardware sector too soon. Clearly, the era of monolithic<br>
monoprocessor machines is drawing to an end. Oh yes, I know<br>
that has been heralded for years. To no effect. But the SMP<br>
business is now quite there. As the infamous i80xxx chip<br>
line is but an artefact of clever marketing, excellent products<br>
solely, if judged using the "maximization of profits over time"<br>
success metric, it won't last forever. Having tasted first fruits<br>
of modern telecommunications, entertainment, and industrial<br>
automation, we long for more.<br>
<p>
I won't hazard a time-line, but...<br>
<p>
Multithreading as bottom-up, PVM/MPI as top-down, monolithic<br>
systems are starting to crumble, dispersing themselves over<br>
threads, over CPUs, over nodes. DSPs with multiple CPUs on<br>
die have appeared. TI's new TMSC6x family, with low complexity FLIW<br>
cores, memory on die and links is pointing in the right direction.<br>
Since core on die is a must (due to vastly better access time,<br>
lack of bonding pads and associated silicon real estate and power<br>
dissipation losses), yet chip yield must be excellent to make<br>
the maspar system affordable, node complexity will be low. This<br>
is even more stringent for wafer scale integration (WSI), which<br>
will liberate us from vagarities of multilayered motherboards.<br>
As integration densities will rise, clocks go up and signal<br>
levels go down, geometrical constraints will start to bite. Ouch.<br>
This means buses (lest they would spring all bonds of modesty<br>
with their girth) will have to go the ways of all trash. Serial<br>
short high-speed buses, first electronical, then optical,<br>
will shuffle in their place. OS architecture will be forced<br>
to the OOP nanokernel flavour. We will have virtual machines,<br>
and JIT compilers. Since code density, due to small grain<br>
size, will need to go up, we'll see a brief renaissance<br>
of threaded code. Which will force fast context switches,<br>
and a dedicated hardware on-die return stack. Rejoiceth,<br>
ye Forth followers, for ye finest hour is at hand.<br>
<p>
So your next desktop might feature hundreds of processors<br>
(on one, or several motherwafers), interlinked by wafer-local<br>
serial links, network routers/switches on-die. We will<br>
have a modest RAID, linked by fiber optics, and possibly<br>
even solid-state holographic memory. The thing will listen,<br>
and speak. A DLP/DMD-like beamer device could be the output.<br>
Augmented reality headup will accomplish the same much<br>
cheaper, however. People won't turn and stare anymore, if<br>
you don your designer wearable every morning. Who ever<br>
selected "beam" from the Newton communication menu, knows<br>
full well why Borgs have their photogenically blinking<br>
semiconductor laser. It is so darn convenient. Besides,<br>
intercepting a tightly focused face2face laser beam is<br>
virtually impossible, while monitoring cellular traffic,<br>
even if it all crypted garbage, is a piece of cake. Besides,<br>
a NIR laser is also handy to light your way, a wearable CCD<br>
camera assuming.<br>
<p>
The same universal optical links could bind the local web.<br>
Overlapping local web patches will spin internet++, the next<br>
Big Thing. Matrix perversion will become a very serious problem,<br>
whatever hardware protection schemes and virtual machines<br>
will form our node-local firewalls. (A certain company, which<br>
I will not name, has now a smart card developed, which will<br>
house and run applications, written in virtual machine assembly.<br>
To counteract possible perversion, both the specification and<br>
the sources are kept secret. Ha-ha. As if one couldn't read<br>
the bit pattern directly, with finite effort. Or simply run<br>
a crashme. (Uh-oh, my wallet has crashed. I'm broke.) I'd<br>
like to see that virtual machine which will terminate<br>
randomly generated code cleanly).<br>
<p>
Sounds neat, eh? Of course it's all wrong.<br>
<p>
For one, I didn't mention reconfigurable hardware. Back in the<br>
1987, a need for virtual hardware has been already obvious. Now<br>
EHW, evolvable hardware, evolving mindlessly, promises to deliver<br>
fuzzy solutions to our succinct specifications. So reconfigurable<br>
hardware will start gaining a progressively prominent piece of<br>
silicon real estate. However, EHW is not enough. Darwinian<br>
bricolage does not work well (heck, not at all) on brittle<br>
systems, and logic gate assemblies, sadly, bristle with<br>
brittleness. So we need a different paradigm, as, while our<br>
sensorics is excellent, and motorics adequate, the processing<br>
prowess is simply nonexistant. Our hardware must form a cozy<br>
container for a tasty bitsoup, swirling madly in its GA dance,<br>
mapping sensoric vector to the motorics one. This soup must<br>
not be brittle. This soup must run on a monster of a hardware,<br>
featuring gigantic integration densities, ridiculous numbers<br>
of identical elements, an atomic hardware simplicity which<br>
is trivial beyond belief. Virtual hardware will mend.<br>
<p>
What for?<br>
<p>
We need cleaning robots, both for the flat, the street, and<br>
the PV array. We need nannybots, to cater for the sick and<br>
the elderly. We need heavy-duty machines which will prospect and<br>
mine, and delicate agribots, which can pluck a fruit fly from flight.<br>
We need realtime neural compression, and decompression. We need<br>
systems, producing solutions, to our specifications, on time.<br>
Like yesterday. We need surplus neural performance and bandwidth,<br>
to be skimmed from the web as the daylight load flood passes on,<br>
leaving nocturnal low load tide, to be thrown at problems at hand.<br>
Like, building even better mousetraps. To catch your molecular<br>
switch, and the bit of string.<br>
<p>
Why are we working at making ourselves obsolete, and so hard?<br>
I don't know. Probably, it's simple self-destruction. Don't<br>
judge the neo-Luddites so hard. Sooner, or later, we all will<br>
face _personal_ white-collar unemployment. Inasmuch ubiquitous<br>
welfare is compatible with free markets is open to doubt. What<br>
is not open to doubt, is that a closed autoreplication loop<br>
does not need flesh to operate. By then, you either are a<br>
integral part of the machine, or, obsolete.<br>
<p>
And we all know what happens to low-fitness species. Rapid extinction.<br>
So root hog, and/or die.<br>
<p>
