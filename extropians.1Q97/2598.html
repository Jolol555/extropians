<i>&gt; Assuming the capability to, as Hal puts it,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;directly perceive the innards of another person's mind.  You see what </i><br>
<i>&gt; he sees, follow his thoughts, feel what it is like to be him.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; the question is, what happens to your own historical sensations, </i><br>
<i>&gt; memories and feelings while this mind link is occurring?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If they are somehow completely disconnected, how would you remember </i><br>
<i>&gt; the experience once you were no longer linked?  Or, if you still had </i><br>
<i>&gt; access to your own thought processes during the link then wouldn't </i><br>
<i>&gt; those act as a filter for those of the other person, so that you would </i><br>
<i>&gt; never really be directly experiencing what it is like to be them?</i><br>
<p>
This is all very hypothetical so it is hard to say how it might work.<br>
If we take your first alternative, that you don't have access to your<br>
own memories and feelings while reading someone else's mind, I don't<br>
see why it would follow that you would have trouble remembering the<br>
experience afterwards.  I may undergo some experience and not access my<br>
memories during it, but that doesn't make it hard for me to remember it<br>
afterwards.<br>
<p>
I think you are right that in the second case, you would have a less<br>
accurate picture of the other person's feelings, since your own reactions<br>
might be confused with his.  However presumably with practice you could<br>
learn to disentangle the two more easily.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But, seriously, the ability to _integrate_ multiple sources of </i><br>
<i>&gt; 'experience' would definitely be needed by an upload with multiple </i><br>
<i>&gt; robot bodies wandering around the world, and even by someone who is </i><br>
<i>&gt; just 'jacked into' cyberspace and receiving simultaneous inputs from </i><br>
<i>&gt; many sources on the Net, let alone a direct mind-link to another </i><br>
<i>&gt; person.</i><br>
<p>
Sometimes after an intense dream I awaken, and for a few moments it is<br>
hard to reconcile the memories from the dream (which sometimes include<br>
events which supposedly took place before the dream began) with my<br>
real memories.  Maybe this experience would be similar to merging two<br>
disjoint sets of memories as you describe.<br>
