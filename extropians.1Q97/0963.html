In a message dated 97-01-20 18:07:45 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; I don't think I've ever said anything contrary to that.  Indeed, I quite<br>
 clearly stated that I experience and enjoy emotion regularly.  To deny<br>
 their existence in myself or others, or to act to supress them, would<br>
 indeed be irrational.<br>
 <br>
<p>
Actually I believe you said you wallow in them. ; )<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;&lt; What I am saying is entirely different.  I am saying one should not<br>
 /evaluate/ ideas by the emotional response to them, but by reason. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Which is balancing emtional response with rational thought, and what I<br>
suggested<br>
 to begin with.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;To<br>
 use words only to manipulate the emotions of the listener--positively<br>
 as well as negatively--is to treat him as a puppet instead of a human.<br>
 He has a rational mind.&gt;&gt; <br>
<p>
No one suggests you should do that. <br>
<p>
 &lt;&lt;He has free will.  I know this because I know<br>
 that I have free will.  I refuse to insult him by tailoring my ideas<br>
 to his irrational reactions.  Indeed, if I know he has these irrational<br>
 reactions, I want to help him overcome them, not deny or evade them.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
We can get into free will if you want, just know that I also beleive like you<br>
that we have it, and am also aware that it is something that needs to be<br>
practised just like restraint of pen and tongue.<br>
