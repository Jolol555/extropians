In a message dated 97-02-25 10:57:06 EST, you write:  <br>
  <br>
&lt;&lt; HIV, the virus the government says  <br>
 causes AIDS.  &gt;&gt;  <br>
  <br>
This is not a case of government  vs. science.  <br>
  <br>
Scientists in two different countries (France and the United States), first<br>
said HIV causes AIDS, not "governments."  Governments are mindless idiots.<br>
 The governments only adopted what the scientists proved via the peer review<br>
process.    <br>
  <br>
Scientists developed the current screening tests showing the HIV viral<br>
antibodies in AIDS infected fluids.  Using Koch's postulates HIV was shown to<br>
cause AIDS.  The "dissidents" have not shown the contrary.  The dissidents<br>
have been rejected via peer review.  HIV = AIDS could be completely wrong but<br>
the dissidents have no acceptable evidence. <br>
  <br>
Governments are politically correct to suit themselves.  It is true they<br>
don't care for science unless it is politically correct.  HIV causes AIDS is<br>
currently both scientifically supportable and politically correct.  Otherwise<br>
governments would say anything off -the-wall, such as AIDS is the wrath of<br>
God.  Just as off-the-wall as what the dissidents are currently saying.   <br>
