And the fact that although the design of OS/2 1.x was technically better<br>
than Windows 3.x, the early versions were no better in reality (e.g. OS/2<br>
1.2 (AFAIR) which was unable to print anything) and didn't even come with<br>
the few minor applications that Windows provided, like Write and<br>
Solitaire. It also required more RAM at a time when RAM was extremely<br>
expensive. <br>
<p>
Finally, as far as I'm aware, Windows NT grew out of the OS/2 NT project<br>
to produce OS/2 2.0. Given the relative lack of success of NT as compared<br>
to Windows 3.x and 95, that tends to imply that OS/2 NT would have done no<br>
better. <br>
<p>
So IMHO the blame for Windows' success rests at least as strongly on IBM<br>
as Microsoft. Of course, if OS/2 had been more successful then people <br>
would hate IBM rather than Microsoft.<br>
