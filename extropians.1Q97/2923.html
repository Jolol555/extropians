I'm responding to this thread half a day late, as always, being on the wrong<br>
side of the planet.  So ten other people have probably made the same point<br>
already.  But I had to add: not to mention telomere degradation in adult<br>
cells.  Presumably poor little Dolly is some years closer to the Hayflick<br>
limit than her woolly playmates, and will keel over earlier.  (Not that this<br>
matter with lamb chops on the hoof.  But I wouldn't wish to be grafted into<br>
a pre-aged clone.  So we'll have to retain our own embryo samples after all.<br>
Um, not `we', a tad late for that - our kids.)<br>
