Note from Davin C. Enigl, microbiologist:  Cytomegalovirus (CMV ) has been<br>
proposed as a limited co-factor in AIDS, See: Int. Conf. AIDS 1990, Jun<br>
20-23; 6(1):295(abstract Th.C.680).  The following forwarded message involves<br>
a disease often related to AIDS  possibly caused by HHV-8.<br>

BLOOD, SCREENING FOR INFECTIOUS AGENTS<br>
======================================<br>
<p>
Date: Sat, 01 Mar 1997 11:44:27 -0800<br>
From: CDPC-mail (Jim Chin) &lt;jchin@cdpc.com&gt;<br>
<p>
March 1, 1997 - From the Lancet<br>
<p>
When should blood banks begin to routinely screen for an infectious agent?<br>
<p>
Molecular evidence has linked human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) with Kaposi's<br>
sarcoma, and serological studies have shown that the virus occurs [also] in <br>
the healthy population.  However, Blackbourn and colleagues' recovery of<br>
infectious HHV-8 from a healthy blood donor is the first evidence that the <br>
virus could be transmitted by blood transfusion (Lancet 1997; Vol 349, No. <br>
9052: 609-11).  Allain's commentary in the same issue of the Lancet (p 584) <br>
discusses the issues surrounding when, or if, screening of donated blood for <br>
newly discovered viruses should be introduced.  Once transmissibility has <br>
been established, the other important issues are whether the virus is found <br>
commonly, whether the infection persists, and whether the virus causes a <br>
serious disease (these criteria are fulfilled by hepatitis C virus, for <br>
example).  For HHV-8, the next step is confirmation that the virus is <br>
transmitted; the other questions can then be addressed. <br>
