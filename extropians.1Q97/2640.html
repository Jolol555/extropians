<i>&gt; It's called adapting in a co-evolutionary environment, survival of the</i><br>

<p>
Nope. We are going to use science to remove evolution's constraints on<br>
us. How? When we finally create the enabling technology necessary to be<br>
"immortal", we will no longer be participating in evolution. We will no<br>
longer have to reproduce in order to perpetuate the race. We will make a<br>
shift from species evolution to individual development. <br>
<p>
Evolution has got us where we are today. For that I am appreciative. But<br>
it will one day be obsolete to me when I have developed beyond its<br>
primitive ways. Evolution does not have the necessary self-consciousness<br>
to see beyond violence. I do.<br>
<p>
If I attain immortality via science, I doubt I will forever remain in<br>
this universe. It may take thousands or even millions of years, perhaps<br>
only a couple centuries, but I am optimistic that one day as a highly<br>
*developed* entity I will learn to create my own universes, my own<br>
realities. I am just as optimistic that I will have by then developed<br>
something better, more *useful* than evolution.<br>
<p>
Does evolution itself not evolve? No you say. You say its laws are<br>
absolute and I must not question its laws of violence. Here is yet<br>
another ontotheological sublimation. <br>
<p>
Heres an analogy of how we progress in moral matters. We once allowed<br>
and even advocated slavery, even George Washington had slaves. Good<br>
businessmen had slaves, but we overcame that. Our modern enslavement is<br>
employment. The general masses are given minimum wage, hardly enough to<br>
survive, so that they must work endless hours, thus giving them no time<br>
to question the system, but some day, perhaps very soon, sciences such<br>
as nanotechnology will allow us to overcome this modern form of slavery.<br>
When we can make anything we need on demand from self-replicating<br>
devices, we will no longer have a need for money, the single most<br>
corrupting concept in our modern times.<br>
<p>
Just as we can overcome slavery by degree, we can overcome violence by<br>
degree. Your difficulty in understanding this may lie in a black and<br>
white perceptiong of violence vs non-violence. There are degrees between<br>
them. All that is required to begin moving towards non-violence is to<br>
take steps by degree.<br>
  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Wow, I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; impressed with what you can do once you've chucked truth out the window.</i><br>
<p>
Its more amazing than you seem to have the capacity to realize.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You move through life, from conception to death, appropriating space and</i><br>
<i>&gt; time, energy and matter from the living entities in your environment.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes I do, but by degree I do so in a much less violent manner than many<br>
of my ancestors, and I certainly, by degree, do so in a much less<br>
violent manner than many of my contemporaries. I am developing towards<br>
non-violence. Eventually we will learn to tap into the energy in empty<br>
space. We will no longer be required to take it from the other.<br>
Eventually we will be able to create our own space, no longer having to<br>
take it from the other. We are begining to enable the technology now to<br>
make this possible.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  You</i><br>
<i>&gt; are violently appropriating these all the time, whether or not you have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; capacity to appreciate or desire such violent appropriation.  This is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth.  If you jettison truth, I guess you can usefully delude yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you have not been committing acts of violence all your life against</i><br>
<i>&gt; other living entities, whether you knew you were or not.</i><br>
<p>
I never said I had not taken part in violent activity. All competitive<br>
activity is violent. I said I had never been in a physical fight. It is<br>
your authoritarian truth sublimated in evolution that does not allow you<br>
to see beyond violence.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; You can try to define this aspect of life away, but you will not change the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reality of it.</i><br>
<p>
The reality of? The absolute and unquestionable, unchangeable truth of<br>
it? I am not going to define that aspect of life away, I am going to<br>
determine it as unuseful and thus in *action* create and alternative. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What right do you have to exist at all, where did it come</i><br>
<i>&gt; from?</i><br>
<p>
Why are you ceaselessly attempting to bring authoritarean concepts into<br>
these matters? Your argument has been based on evolution up to this<br>
point, and now you bring the concept of "rights" into the picture,<br>
something that does not exist in evolution. Evolution sees no rights.<br>
Via natural selection it removes the least fit. The least fit are given<br>
no rights by evolution.  <br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Again, I see here a utopian dream to revoke evolutionary laws.</i><br>
<p>
By *utopian* you mean nice but *impossible* to achieve. A round earth<br>
was imagined impossible by those who lacked the capacity to imagine<br>
otherwise. Space travel was thought to be impossible by those who lacked<br>
the capacity to imagine otherwise. The atomic bomb was thought to be<br>
impossible by those who lacked the capacity to imagine otherwise. Just<br>
because you lack the capacity to imagine a non-violent world does not<br>
mean that it cannot or will not be achieved. Science eventually<br>
penetrates such obstenance. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;  One of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; best descriptions of evolution I have seen, is a famous passage by Joseph</i><br>
<i>&gt; de Maistre from his book "Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg":</i><br>
[SNIP]<br>
<p>
How could that be one of the best descriptions of evolution when it<br>
focuses primarily on killing. What about the natural selection part. You<br>
are focusing on one out of many parts of evolution. I will grant you<br>
that the part on killing is a suitable definition. This is why science<br>
will eventually overcome evolution.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suspect this view of evolution is uncomfortable for you.</i><br>
<p>
No. I do not find words or groups of words uncomfortable. Once again, I<br>
am not trying to redefine evolution. It is what it is. I am merely<br>
attempting to illustrate how such will be transcended by future science.<br>
You can choose to take part in this now, to wait til later until more<br>
people have, or to wholly deny it forever ... but in either case, it<br>
will occur. I am dynamically optimistic of this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is far</i><br>
<i>&gt; easier to indulge in psycho-babble to divert attention from how things</i><br>
<i>&gt; really work.</i><br>
<p>
I see how things work now just fine. I think the psycho-babble as you<br>
call it is being used to inhibit a progressive view on what is possible<br>
in the future. You are clinging to how things are *now*, and are thus<br>
unopen to change. <br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you view the truth to be committing violence, and you dislike violence,</i><br>
<i>&gt; no wonder you dislike truth.</i><br>
<p>
What? Stop confusing truth as an entity. It is not a person, a god, or a<br>
thing. It is a concept. Truth cannot commit an act of violence. Truth<br>
cannot commit an act of any sort. This is one of the fundamental<br>
problems. You mistake what I am saying as something entirely different<br>
from what it is. At first I thought the problem was in your method of<br>
decontextualization. But now I am uncertain that you are aware of it at<br>
all.  <br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Modern neuroscience, particularly in the nineties, has pretty much done</i><br>
<i>&gt; away with the last disreputable vestiges of this Freudian propaganda.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Has it? Please elaborate for the sake of argument. I do not believe this<br>
to be the case. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Our emotions don't make us robots, they make us human.</i><br>
<p>
To the extent that our emotions determine they do make us robots or<br>
automaton. And I am not going to fall into a trap of limiting what it is<br>
to be human, but transhumans will certainly have taken much more control<br>
over their emotions than contemporary humans. They will be able to lose<br>
their emotive control less often while being able to become impassioned<br>
and ecstatic more often.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your distaste for</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth again shows itself by inverting reality.  Trust your emotions, give</i><br>
<i>&gt; yourself a break.</i><br>
<p>
I will not trust my emotions, I will not have *blind faith* in my<br>
emotions. Your advice is particularly non-extropian.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just because people have claimed that eating Twinkies</i><br>
<i>&gt; caused them to commit heinous criminal acts doesn't mean they can escape</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsibility for their actions.</i><br>
<p>
The law holds these people responsible, but the people do not. You are<br>
showing me an inability to take responsibility for your violent desires.<br>
You say it is the fault of evolution, and that evolution cannot be<br>
questioned. Thus you claim that evolution is at fault or is responsible<br>
for violent desires. Fine, perpetuate it as long as you can, but it will<br>
not last.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;This need to show others that we are stronger is caused by excess dopamine</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the central nervous system.  It is primitive.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sheesh, what do I know, huh?  Here I thought it was a fiendishly complex</i><br>
<i>&gt; adaptive evolutionary strategy to survive.  The world is so much simpler</i><br>
<i>&gt; when that pesky truth isn't hanging around being such a wet blanket.</i><br>
<p>
Nope, I was illustrating the particular cause. There are many levels of<br>
cause determining every event. We could never mention them all. Not<br>
everyone has the same level of dopamine running through their system.<br>
People with less dopamine and more seratonin tend to think more<br>
rationally on these issues, they tend to be less violent, because they<br>
do not have as a great an urge to prove that they have bigger balls. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;Look at our entertainment industry. It is fueled by our appreciation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; violence.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is fueled by dumping truth in favor of utility.  Violence has great</i><br>
<i>&gt; utility for the barbarians of today who have grown up spoon-fed a steady</i><br>
<i>&gt; diet of your brand of relativism.</i><br>
<p>
This is contrary to the rest of your argument. Your theory is the one<br>
which embraces violence. Mine is the one that does not, thus your theory<br>
is the one which promotes and supports the appreciation of violence in<br>
entertainment, and mine does not.  <br>
 <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;People have violent urges when they feel insecure.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are a lot of elderly individuals who feel insecure in their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; neighborhoods because of the roving barbaric thugs, steeped in relativism</i><br>
<i>&gt; and chock full of self-esteem, outside their doors.  Do the insecure</i><br>
<i>&gt; elderly in this situation have violent urges?</i><br>
<p>
Nope, in general they no longer have the dopamine levels necessary. Some<br>
do, but most do not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Is it these raging grannies</i><br>
<i>&gt; we need to slip an emotive education to?</i><br>
<p>
Nope, they are moving towards death themselves. Their phenotype is no<br>
longer required by evolution to prove that they have bigger balls.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Are you getting this from "Psychology Today"?  Barney the Dinosaur?  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ricki Lake Show?</i><br>
<p>
No, I do not watch much television. I believe it was you who was quoting<br>
someone from "Married with Children" in another post. My life is a hell<br>
of a lot more interesting than anything they can show on some sitcom. I<br>
find sitcoms and television in general to be of little value to me. So<br>
please do not infer that your because you value television, our modern<br>
opiate of the masses, that I do also. I have chosen to take a degree of<br>
responsibity for the quality of information I consume. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you mean like "Love your neighbor" and "Turn the other cheek"?  How</i><br>
<i>&gt; novel.</i><br>
<p>
Nope. You do not have to love someone in order not to be violent against<br>
them. And no I am not saying turn the other cheek. I am saying to first<br>
seek a non-violent alternative instead of immiediately responding to a<br>
situation violently. In this way we will move towards non-violence by<br>
degree. It is your over simplification of the complexity of my thought<br>
that is not allowing you to see its validity. This is not to say that it<br>
is very complex, just more so than you are willing to deal with.<br>
