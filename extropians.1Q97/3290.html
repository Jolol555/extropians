<i>&gt;of the cycles I describe below came from here.]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's hard to judge the accuracy of the cycles picked out in this book</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the earlier Generations unless you know history well.  What were</i><br>
<i>&gt;things really like in the 1910's, the 1870's?  The authors describe</i><br>
<i>&gt;events which fit pretty well into the cycles, but who knows whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;they are being selective?  One solution would be to look at what other</i><br>
<i>&gt;historians say about this work.  Does anyone here have information about</i><br>
<i>&gt;what the authors' peers say?</i><br>
<p>
I did mention the web page above in my original message.  In addition<br>
I gave a link to a web page review by someone with history expertize.<br>
<p>
This was my biggest concern, and why I didn't endorse it as strongly<br>
back in '95.  But I have since talked to Caltech historians who think the<br>
authors are reasonable people, have learned that historians are widely<br>
aware of their work (they just gave a talk at Harvard), and I have<br>
seen that while there have been negative reviews (NYT Book Review<br>
1/26, Publisher's Weekly 1/6), they haven't been of the form I was<br>
concerned about: "The got their facts all wrong."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;... But I don't really perceive there to have been a change</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the national mood in the middle 1980's, nor for the period up until</i><br>
<i>&gt;then to have been a continuation of the 1960's.  In fact, it's hard for</i><br>
<i>&gt;me to imagine anyone looking at recent history and outlining the period</i><br>
<i>&gt;from 1964 to 1984 as having a coherent national mood, distinct from that</i><br>
<i>&gt;which follows.</i><br>
<p>
I think you're taking the boundaries too seriously.  The key idea is<br>
that there are cycles with a roughly 80-90 year period.  For example,<br>
about now is the mid third turning, where we should see a min gender<br>
role gap and weakest families, max individualism and diversified<br>
social structure.  About 1974 we should have seen max<br>
underprotectiveness of kids, max focus on "inner worlds". (I'm reading<br>
all this off of the chart on p.105)  These all fit to me.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then, they have to compare the present day with the Great Depression.</i><br>
<p>
Huh?  The Depression was a fourth turning, comparable to what we may<br>
soon face, not to now.<br>
