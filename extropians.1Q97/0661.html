He said it was 6 kt of TNT, while my calculation was 15 tons....<br>

<i>&gt; in saying that?  You're the one James cited for confusing force and</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy units.</i><br>
<p>
I was admitting my own mistake. See, even the hugely arrogant Mike can<br>
admit it when he is wrong. I was also posting the correct answer, which<br>
was not what Mark had posted.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } A 10 MT device will only have a damage area of between 4-8 times larger</i><br>
<i>&gt; } than a 300 KT device, which is why the powers have gotten away from</i><br>
<i>&gt; } using big nukes, as they are not as cost effective as using the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; } amount of material in four or more devices.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which makes your defense problem much harder, as you now get to try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; detect and shoot down many more and smaller missiles.  30 times more</i><br>
<i>&gt; missiles, using the sizes just above.  Admittedly Earth has to have that</i><br>
<i>&gt; many more rockets delivering the warheads, but I think it just might</i><br>
<i>&gt; manage that for the sake of defense.</i><br>
<p>
Not at all. I was referring to atmospheric impacts. According to James,<br>
earthgov will still need to build and use meganukes to have as much of<br>
an impact under vacuum conditions as a much smaller nuke would on earth,<br>
so not only are we looking at a differential of energy expenditure and<br>
application of four due to gravity, but the two environments of<br>
atmosphere and vacuum also put earth based forces at a disadvantage.<br>
<p>
As you all have read my statements before, that war strategically is a<br>
competition of cost effectiveness in battle. These two differences, in<br>
gravitational potential and environment, between earth and the moon are<br>
significant in giving any lunar David a much more even hand against the<br>
terran Goliath.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } an earth based target. While I do not know how to calculate the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; } or estimated equivalence, I think that this is a significant factor to</i><br>
<i>&gt; } consider.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So is the 15 ton rock impact.</i><br>
