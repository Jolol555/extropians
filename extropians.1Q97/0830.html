<i>&gt; Originally, you picked out two sentences for criticism: "You</i><br>
<i>&gt; shouldn't offend people" and "People can be hurt by words". The</i><br>
<i>&gt; second sentence is demonstrably true (I have deliberately hurt far</i><br>
<i>&gt; too many people with the cruelty of my tongue to believe otherwise).</i><br>
<i>&gt; The first sentence, being a moral injunction, yields its truth-value</i><br>
<i>&gt; less easily. But neither of these statements that you originally</i><br>
<i>&gt; singled out for criticism say "shut up because you might cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; offence". To me, they say rather, "phrase your criticism in a way</i><br>
<i>&gt; that shows some awareness of and sensitivity to the emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt; predispositions of your audience".</i><br>
<p>
I think the first statement and my later clarification are much<br>
the same thing: "Don't say something that might be offensive". <br>
This is the easier of the two memes to attack, and perhaps by<br>
concentrating on it, I reduced my arguments for the other into a<br>
strawman by merely leaving the association in place.  So, let me <br>
take on the latter directly:  "People can be hurt by words" is a<br>
counterproductive meme.<br>
<p>
Let us imagine ourselves as uploaded beings, as Katherine did in<br>
another response to my assertion.  In that realm, we receive inputs<br>
from various sources: sensory devices, data storage devices, and<br>
network packets--communications from other beings on the net.  We<br>
process these inputs, manipulate them, add our own creations, <br>
evaluate the results, and produce outputs: either physical outputs<br>
(such as buildings, artworks) or messages to other beings.  In the<br>
net, there is a standard for exchange of information.  A packet <br>
format, addresses, routing protocols; a "language" of sorts.  Now<br>
in this environment, let us say that a message is sent from one<br>
being to another.  It is addressed properly, in the proper format,<br>
and represents data processed by a similar being.  If the being<br>
that receives the packet has designed his input mechanisms in such<br>
a way that certain properly-formatted packets that don't meet some<br>
more specific criterion cause him to malfunction, or to delay the<br>
processing of other information, or to perform counterproductive<br>
work, or to misinterpret other inputs, would you not consider such<br>
an arrangement to be an engineering flaw in the recipient?  You<br>
would ask why he made his system fragile to a properly-formatted<br>
input.  You would advise him to engineer himself more robustly.<br>
<p>
It's not too different in the meat world.  We process inputs, we<br>
send messages, and we receive messages in agreed-upon languages.<br>
The suggestion, then, that one should spend time anticipating the<br>
recipient's probable response to a message before we send it seems<br>
equivalent to making the internals of each machine on the net part<br>
of the communication protocol.  No one would ever engineer a net<br>
that way.  The purpose of protocols is to set a standard so that<br>
we /don't/ have to know about the internals of every machine just<br>
to send information around.<br>
<p>
Let us instead engineer ourselves more robustly to accept inputs<br>
without malfunctioning, so that we can make use of a wider diversity<br>
of inputs--experiences and communications--to work from.  And let<br>
us design the /protocol/ clear, expandable, and powerful enough to<br>
accommodate our needs.  Let's work on the language, and on our<br>
understanding and reasoning, and on our ability to express ideas<br>
in the language, rather than piling on burdens beyond the language<br>
that we must accumulate like a stack of manual errata and release<br>
notes (sorry if I'm getting too deep into the metaphor).<br>
<p>
In short, let us stive to make ourselves more adaptable, tolerant,<br>
and less fragile to experiences and ideas instead of putting limits<br>
on the ideas we can express. <br>
