<i>&gt; &gt; Do you deny that need and scarcity exist? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It only exists in the minds of those who don't realize that it should no</i><br>
<i>&gt; longer be of concern in an automated society. Uploading is a different</i><br>
<i>&gt; ball-game and the rules have changed.</i><br>
<p>
Do you really think so?  Even in a transhuman world, conservation of<br>
mass-energy leads to scarcity of resources.  There's only so much<br>
energy output from the sun, only so much fissionable material in the<br>
crust, and the more powerful and capable humans become, the more uses<br>
they will find for it.<br>
<p>
The reason I react so negatively to your excoriation of "capitalism"<br>
and "economics" is that I can clearly see that what /I/ call by those<br>
names--which is pretty much their dictionary meaning--are the only<br>
hope of survival for mankind in the future.<br>
<p>
The practices you object to in your screeds are indeed deplorable,<br>
and those who practice them justify them in terms of "capitalism" and<br>
"economics", but that doesn't make capitalism bad, it makes them liars.<br>
Republicans talk aout "free trade" while they steal from the working<br>
man to give welfare to corporations; but that doesn't mean free trade<br>
is bad, it means Republicans are hypocrites.  Democrats talk about<br>
"fairness" and "compassion" while they steal from the working man to<br>
line their pockets and promote their agendas; that doesn't make the<br>
ideas bad, it makes them hypocrites.<br>
<p>
By taking the predators' definitions of words the way they use them,<br>
you eliminate their power to fight for what they really mean, and you<br>
play into the hands of the enemy by letting them set the terms of<br>
combat.  Take back the language!  Use words correctly, to mean what<br>
they really mean, not the crimes they are used to justify.  Clarity<br>
of thought is the only way to fight propaganda.  Economics is just a<br>
science, nothing more.  A branch of knowledge to discover.  Capitalism<br>
and free trade are man's only means of survival without violence.<br>
They should be fought for proudly, honestly, in plain terms.  When<br>
your enemy uses those words to justify his iniquities, you should show<br>
that he is wrong, and why, and fight him; not believe him and retreat.<br>
