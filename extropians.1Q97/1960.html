A recap of some recent statements in this series:<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;Where something is predictable, then free will does not exist.&gt;<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Is an entity forced to make predictions in order to find out if the<br>
entity has free will?&gt;<br>
<p>
Omega: &lt;As predictions go, they only tell us where free will is not,<br>
something I feel is essential not for finding out if we have free will, but<br>
for better approaching the problem of effective self-transformation.&gt;<br>
<p>
After thinking about this, it seems that the search for the existence of<br>
free will ends up at the same garbage dump that the search for the<br>
existence of rationality ends up at.  There is no "ground" to free will any<br>
more than there is "ground" to rationality.  We have here a method to see<br>
where free will is not, but not to actually find out if we have it at all. <br>
Likewise, we have a method to see where rationality is not, namely where<br>
reasoning entities are selected out of existence, but not to actually find<br>
out if we have rationality at all, because what is defined as rational can<br>
only intelligibly be done a posteriori.  It is not enough to say "I am<br>
rational because I am doing something for a reason," the follow-up question<br>
must be asked, "Did it work?"  Likewise with free will, it is not enough to<br>
say "I have free will because I choose to do something," the follow-up<br>
question must be asked, "What choice did you really have?"  The operation<br>
of free will and rationality cannot be shown a priori, there is an<br>
unavoidable information deficit.<br>
<p>
In the "Free Will" post between John C. &amp; Omega,<br>
<p>
Omega wrote 1/30/97: &lt;...at this time because I feel that no ontological<br>
basis has yet been defined for the concept of self-referencing.  I am not<br>
nit-picking this issue just for the fun of it, but because I believe that<br>
establishing the ontological basis for self-referencing requires us to<br>
penetrate into an area of the ontologically unknown that we currently<br>
perceive as acausal behind which we may find both a truer form of<br>
acausality, and the ontological basis for self-referencing.&gt;<br>
<p>
Leibniz's monads were a stab in this direction, a very fruitful stab<br>
considering that little or no metaphysical work worth the name has been<br>
done since him.  I have been pondering the nature of the link between the<br>
hypothesis that life evolves in the direction of "the edge of chaos"<br>
(actually defined more rigorously in the biophysics work coming out of the<br>
Santa Fe Institue), and the acausal (or transcendental) realm that provides<br>
the coherency to matter-energy structural systems, the source of existence,<br>
if you will.  You have stated the matter well.<br>
<p>
You have covered the circularity of John C.'s Turing-related definition of<br>
free will in this post, I will not get into it, other than to note how<br>
circularity seems to creep into most discussions that approach within<br>
striking distance of metaphysical presuppositions.  I heartily approve of<br>
the way you boiled the distinction down to:<br>
<p>
&lt;1. Classical:  A self-referencing locus of the acausal.<br>
2. Yours:      The state of self-referenced unpredictability.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yup, that's it.<br>
<p>
&lt;Since the inevitableness of self-referenced Turing unpredictability is<br>
really just another another way of saying that all systems suffer from<br>
Godelian incompleteness with regard to the subject of their own behavior,<br>
how can we turn around and then claim it to be some kind of causal<br>
principle by which an entity would effect its "will" within the world?<br>
<p>
I see two possible answers to this question:<br>
<p>
a. Your definition of free will is so mutant that it no longer even claims<br>
to be something that represents a causal principle by which an entity would<br>
effect its "will" within the world, and thus amounts to a tautology that<br>
expresses nothing more than the Godelian incompleteness of a<br>
self-referencing entity regarding its own behavior.  Tautology definitions:<br>
   <br>
   1: Needless repetition of the same sense in different words.<br>
   2: A logical statement which can never be false.<br>
   <br>
b. Or you really are claiming that Godelian incompleteness is some kind of<br>
causal principle by which an entity would effect its "will" within the<br>
world, thus bringing Cartesian dualism back from the grave, in drag.&gt;<br>
<p>
Bravo!  It's unfortunate that your best fencing thrusts are taking place in<br>
a completely different Fourier space than your target is inhabiting, they<br>
are hitting shadows.<br>
<p>
&lt;In any case, having an agreed upon meaning for words is already a<br>
difficult<br>
enough problem in our society without people going around redefining words<br>
on the fly.&gt;<br>
<p>
It's a cryin' shame we can't spank these people any more, the doggone<br>
peacenik slobs have ruined our ability to maintain societal semantic<br>
rectitude.<br>
