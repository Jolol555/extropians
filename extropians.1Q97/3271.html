<i>&gt; I've heard of other digital cash schemes, before, also...</i><br>
<i>&gt; But they were all bound up in real currency.</i><br>
<p>
You mean "government currencies" :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The perrenial problem has been the temptation to make lots</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of currency, resulting in inflation.  They have to have the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; make some currency for each new participant, otherwise stagnation occurs.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think I mentioned how it worked.  If not, here it is.  When you</i><br>
<i>&gt; register your business/service at the gvb(global village bank), they</i><br>
<i>&gt; drop 50 nella into your account.  When they have 1000 people signed up</i><br>
<i>&gt; as service providers, they will put the businesses/services on their web</i><br>
<i>&gt; page.  Then, if you need a service you can look around, and then buy</i><br>
<i>&gt; their service.  So, yes they do have the ability to issue the currency</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the people.  Remember, this is purely fictional currency.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; material you can purchase is digital/intellectual property...</i><br>
<p>
As described, this is precisely as fictional--no more, no less--than<br>
ordinary national currencies.  There is no reason at all you couldn't<br>
use it to to buy and sell anything, just like all the other cybercash<br>
systems on the net (there are several).  If you can sell a document, that<br>
document can be a ticket for redeeming some tangible good, and so long<br>
as there is a relatively fixed amount of currency, or an amount that<br>
inflates at a predictable rate, a useful economy will result.  But as<br>
long as issued volume (and therefore value) is controlled by a monopoly,<br>
that monopoly has incentive to inflate.<br>
<p>
The only honest, safe, truly capitalist way to issue currency is to set<br>
it at a fixed value in tangible goods--say, grams of gold--issued by<br>
competing private banks (like Hong Kong).  And of course, make sure <br>
that you buy deposit insurance valued in currency of the beneficiary's<br>
choice at loss, so that the insurance companies will keep the banks in<br>
line for you.  Banks can still manipulate the money supply by doing<br>
fractional-reserve tricks, but they can never go too far without risking<br>
their promise to redeem in hard goods.<br>
