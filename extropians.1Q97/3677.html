<i>&gt; There's something I don't understand about all the excitement over push.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that the push concept conflates two relatively independent</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas: content filtering, and when-available delivery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Content filtering is what lets you select what you are going to see.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's what we have now when you do a web search on a topic, or when you</i><br>
<i>&gt; bookmark a web page which serves as an index or entry into a subject of</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest.  This is definately a good thing, but existing technologies leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; a lot to be desired.  I have a hard time finding all the information I want</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the web (but the web is still orders of magnitude better than any other</i><br>
<i>&gt; alternative I have used, primarily libraries).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When-available delivery provides you information as it happens.  This sounds</i><br>
<i>&gt; great for sports scores or the latest business news.  Lots of stuff happening</i><br>
<i>&gt; there.  But it's not clear to me that it applies that well to topics beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt; the most superficial popular subjects.  Most areas that I am interested in</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't have that much progress.  Maybe a new paper gets published every few</i><br>
<i>&gt; weeks or months that is really interesting or important.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What worries me is that it is just going to be TV all over again -</i><br>
<i>&gt; the lowest common denominator.  Those areas which work best with push</i><br>
<i>&gt; are going to be the ones where information dribbles out all the time -</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporate press releases, soap operas, headline news, the stock market</i><br>
<i>&gt; ticker, the same old garbage.  That's not what I go to the web for.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The web is an infinite library, holding all kinds of information.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The real problem is not in getting the information delivered, it is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; finding it.  Once I've found a web page that provides a reasonably complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; overview of a field, with lots of other links to relevant pages, then I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a good source.  Yes, it would be useful to be notified when the links</i><br>
<i>&gt; change or some new information is provided.  Push does have a place there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But it's not going to revolutionize my usage of the web, unless the web is</i><br>
<i>&gt; just going to turn into TV.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
However, there are often numerous pages, as well as others popping up or<br>
dissapearing every now and again. Additionally, there are numerous<br>
subjects one may be interested in, as well as degrees of association.<br>
Several months ago we were talking about intelligent agents that we use<br>
to hunt for webcontent that we are interested in, an agent that can<br>
learn to fine tune its foraging to better reflect our real needs, as<br>
well as evolve as our own tastes change over time. Push technology is<br>
merely the beginning of such agents. <br>
<p>
Rather than looking at push as simply slow TV, think of it as customized<br>
TV. Last month I was lamenting that the channels and shows I liked on<br>
the tube were so spread out that it was a pain in the butt to hunt for<br>
them and keep track of what I want to watch when, so much so that I<br>
often miss things I wanted to see, and see nothing interesting when I<br>
have the time available. Push technology is like a smart VCR. I would<br>
love for the cable company to offer the ability for each customer to put<br>
their ten or twenty favorite channels all in the 1-10 or 1-20 slots, so<br>
you dont have to go skipping through the channel spectrum. This is a<br>
need that is becoming more prevalent as more and more channels are added<br>
to the dial.<br>
<p>
Rather than lament this sign of media convergence, we need to recognise<br>
that we are the exceptions, the elites in the new order. Our tastes are<br>
not necessarily the same as the masses. THey are much more used to and<br>
demanding of the practice of being led around by the nose ring. They<br>
typically do not want to have to think about that which is not immediate<br>
to them. Recognising this, we can use this trend to our advantage in our<br>
memetic engineering. Seeing Reilly Jones' excellent commentary of Stove<br>
critiques of irrationality in our intellectual and memetic landscapes, I<br>
am struck by the idea of using push media to push extropic memes into<br>
the mainstream just as irrationalist thinkers did the same in our higher<br>
educational system. <br>
<p>
While it seems paradoxical to propose using entropic methods or media<br>
techniques to spread extropic meme's, we need to recognise that methods<br>
and techniques are not the message, nor are they themselves entropic,<br>
merely that they have been used by entropic forces up to this point in<br>
time. We need to realize that the masses will always demand watered down<br>
versions of "the truth", they can't take 200 proof TRUTH without<br>
overdosing and having an allergic reaction. Diluted doses of any foreign<br>
agent builds up a tolerance over time.<br>
