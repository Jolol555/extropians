This case illustrates some of the strength &amp; weakness of sf.  Yes, sf<br>
authors have considered these subjects in some depth, and their<br>
writings contain many insights worth attending to.  But these insights<br>
are not very well summarized and commented on.<br>
<p>
In other intellectual areas, people write review articles and books,<br>
and textbooks, to summarize and critique the insights so far.  In sf,<br>
these insights are left scattered among hundreds of long novels,<br>
novels mostly devoted to plot and (sometimes) character development.<br>
<p>
It would be a great service if someone could write academic quality<br>
summaries of the insights into the future contained in the existing sf<br>
literature.  One article per topic, such as cloning, would be fine.  <br>
