Mark, its actually good that the list broke as i got quite heated, IMHO<br>
in my reply last night. Here it is for your appraisal, and advanced<br>
apologies for any insult taken.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Sure but how many are in existence. The US does have the SLAM glide</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; warhead. The capability is there, but not the actual devices for deep</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; nuke penetration.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why does that matter? You were talking about only six feet of cover, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10 MT nuke will create a crater around fifteen hundred meters across and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hundred meters deep, causing severe damage down to around two hundred meters.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's in atmosphere, of course, so the effects on the moon may not be as</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad. I don't have any figures handy for smaller explosions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Either way, we don't need to bother with penetrators if your colony is only</i><br>
<i>&gt; buried under six feet of lunar soil. Or, possibly, even six hundred feet.</i><br>
<p>
you are assuming that:<br>
<p>
1) the colony would all be in one tight little place<br>
2) all habitats would be mapped out with correct public coordinates<br>
3) that the warheads would be accurate (a big if at the velocities,<br>
course,and distance you are talking about if you know anything about<br>
such things)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; In any event, the current BMDO technologies on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; drawing boards now and being tested now are fully sufficient to counter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; incoming ballistic weapons on the Moon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I seem to remember Reagan saying something similar about Earth a few years</i><br>
<i>&gt; ago. Note that the majority of the 'Star Wars' effort went towards destroying</i><br>
<i>&gt; the missiles in the boost phase and not near impact as you would have to. A</i><br>
<i>&gt; missile launch is easy to track. A stealthy warhead approaching at 6km/s or</i><br>
<i>&gt; more is much, much harder, particularly if the first things we destroy are</i><br>
<i>&gt; your radar stations. Last I heard the US Army (Air Force?) had admitted that</i><br>
<i>&gt; their Patriot missiles failed to hit a single Scud warhead at a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; fraction of that velocity.</i><br>
<p>
Note: SDI failed not because of technical problems, but because of<br>
politics and money. Even Hans Bethe, one of the big guys in Scientists<br>
for Social Responsibility or some such organization, who was and is a<br>
major opponent of SDI like programs, has been publicly quoted as saying,<br>
"The debate is not longer scientific." (He's a physicist)<br>
<p>
With boost phase, you do have an economic advantage in that with an<br>
opponent that has MIRVed missiles, you can take out multiple warheads<br>
with one hit, making each shot more cost effective. The space based<br>
weapon technical capability was there to do so, but not the<br>
computational ability to coordinate such an architecture that depends on<br>
maximizing the cost effectiveness of each shot (as you've only got so<br>
many railgun shells, laser fuel, and power capacity)(estimates of in the<br>
order of at least 20 million lines of bug proof code to run the system).<br>
<p>
Ground based high energy systems have been shown to be very effective,<br>
as well as aircraft based systems. The Army is currently purchasing a<br>
dozen or so Boeing transport planes specially built with laser gun<br>
systems on them. Current beam weapons of that size can hit Sidewinder<br>
sized missiles (less than 9 feet long and 8 inches in dia.) from over 60<br>
miles away through the atmosphere (laterally). Such weapons based on the<br>
moon with no atmospheric problems would be able to hit any target with a<br>
lunar trajectory within 10,000 miles of leaving earth.<br>
<p>
Thus the strategy has shifted to reentry phase interception, where you<br>
can defend strategic targets very successfully. There are numerous<br>
systems that have been demonstrated viability, including even a phalanx<br>
derived gun system that can shoot somthing like 40,000 rounds per minute<br>
up to a 15 mile altitude. This is controlled by a computer/radar/IR<br>
control system that has been demonstrated to be VERY effective.<br>
unfortunately you don't want to be downrange of the gun when the missed<br>
shots return to earth.<br>
<p>
 The reports in the media that Patriot was wholly unsuccessful were<br>
untrue. What was true was that while hits were scored, a falling dead<br>
missile is still capable of hurting people and damaging property when it<br>
impacts. The important lesson is not to locate strategic targets close<br>
to population centers to avoid collateral damage. Your Patriot type<br>
missiles will deflect the incoming missile from hitting its target, but<br>
will still COME DOWN SOMEWHERE.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, I presume that the Earthers just sat by and watched while you were</i><br>
<i>&gt; building all these high-powered point-defence lasers which couldn't be used</i><br>
<i>&gt; for anything other than defence against an Earth attack?</i><br>
<p>
if the majority of the installation is underground, they would never<br>
notice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; His assertions of insurgencies orchestrated by the CIA/NSA etc. are also</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; vacuous, as intelligence is a two edged sword.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You keep saying that, but it seems to be more of an assertion than an</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument. I note that you chose to ignore my calculations which showed that</i><br>
<i>&gt; your threat to Earth was seriously overrated anyway?</i><br>
<p>
What in numbers of people? useless. in numbers of rocks launched by<br>
railgun? You would not need to decimate the entire surface, that<br>
assertion is just ludicrous. The goal of battle is to destroy the<br>
enemy's ability to wage and support war. Sun Tsu said that a great<br>
General always wins his battles without shooting a single arrow. Do you<br>
have ANY military experience? Using estimates that the US and Russia<br>
have the combined ability to decimate the world ten times over, and that<br>
they have a combined inventory of 40,000 warheads with an average<br>
explosive capacity of 275 kilotons, that means that 4000 warheads would<br>
do, for a combined total of 1,100,000 kilotons of TNT of explosive<br>
force. Given our 10 kiloton clean ferrous warhead (weighing one ton), we<br>
could decimate the world with 110,000 one ton ferrous rocks. Also, as<br>
the military industrial complex of the world covers a much smaller<br>
percentage of it surface, I'll bet that a lunar colony could decimate<br>
the US Chinese and Russian military capability with less than 6000 rocks<br>
(count the installations), and that is taking into account interception<br>
systems, giving 105 rocks to each target based on importance. Places<br>
like NORAD control in Colorado would get some extras just for fun.<br>
<p>
Also, consider this: Luna could put any number of rocks up in orbit way<br>
ahead of time, as part of its minimg operation to supply the<br>
construction of solar sats and colonies. Keeping a decent backlog of<br>
rocks in orbit with little thruster packs would work as an excellent<br>
deterrent system that could not be sabotaged.<br>
<p>
Your assertion that a 1 ton rock falling from lunar space to earth would<br>
only impact with 10 tons of force is also completely laughable. You've<br>
obviously never taken a physics course. Force equals mass times<br>
acceleration ( for which (end velocity^2)/2 can be substituted). Using<br>
gravity, a 1 ton rock accelerates at an average of .5 G for over 150,000<br>
miles (assuming a negligible velocity near the L1 point where Earth and<br>
lunar gravity forces are equal). Falling falling falling.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Placing the gun far enough away to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; make a suited traverse difficult, thus requiring access to traced</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; vehicles is sufficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Someone has to maintain it and run it. Putting it a long distance away</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the habitation merely makes that job harder.</i><br>
<p>
no. safer for the inhabitants (as they will be less likely to be hit by<br>
collateral damage). Putting staff on alert status on site, like firemen,<br>
is easy. I pulled alert duty in the Air Force many times, working on<br>
interceptors. Notice I said "requiring access to traced vehicles". This<br>
is a good practice for maintaining a restricted area. Look at Area 51<br>
for a good example.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; His</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; assertions of developing HumInt assets within the colony are also</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; specious, seeing the past 40 years intelligence communities inability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; develop HumInt here on earth to any degree of reliability.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Like the Soviet inability to steal every important secret from the Manhattan</i><br>
<i>&gt; Project? Or is that why you chose forty years rather than fifty?</i><br>
<p>
They didn't get every secret, but considering the people who developed<br>
it were hired for their hatred of Hitler, while any feelings for or<br>
against Stalin were ignored, it is not surprising. At the time, Stalin<br>
was considered a hero by many Manhattan Scientists. You are also not<br>
understanding the dynamic of the people involved on the moon. ANyone<br>
forced off earth will feel toward earthgov as Cuban Expatriates in Miami<br>
feel toward Fidel Castro. How many of them would spy for old Fidel?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Note that one of the big problems that the intelligence agencies face is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they're trying to quietly infiltrate a different culture. Americans can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily pass for Russians or Iraquis. But Americans can easily pass for American</i><br>
<i>&gt; workers on your colony.</i><br>
<p>
True, but fortunately, every credit agency in the world is an<br>
intelligence agency for hire. you can learn A LOT from a persons credit<br>
record. ALso, the kind of Americans likely to migrate to the moon are<br>
not likely to resemble candidates for CIA training. (not many Yale<br>
yuppies digging moon dirt)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, I think I'm going to go off and read Heinlein, then write a short story</i><br>
<i>&gt; refuting him.</i><br>
<p>
No wonder we are having this argument, you haven't even studied the<br>
preparation material. What would your professors have said? Read it then<br>
come back.<br>
