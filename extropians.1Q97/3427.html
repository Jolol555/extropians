<p>
In The Fourth Turning, Strauss &amp; Howe cite many other sources of<br>
data like this, including a 200 page '69 monograph by Peter Harris in<br>
"Perspectives in American History".  But it would be great if someone<br>
could collect all this data, so we could graph it all and do some more<br>
careful statistical analysis.  <br>

<i>&gt;While Strauss &amp; Howe are worth reading, their predictions do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;appear to be specific enough (at least in Generations) to be clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt;IMPORTANT, and I doubt they can produce more specific predictions</i><br>
<i>&gt;without being wrong on a majority of predictions. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;For instance, Klingberg's theory looked quite impressive in the 70s</i><br>
<i>&gt;when I read it.  ... I was eager to</i><br>
<i>&gt;profit from this theory in 1989 by buying military stocks or Pan Am,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but found no confirmation of the theory at that time.</i><br>
<p>
If you're looking for specific stocks to buy, I agree that this has<br>
limited value.  But in The Fourth Turning they give lots of other<br>
advice that seems pretty valuable to me (assuming they predict well).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Generations' descriptions of economic cycles (p. 355) is inconsistent</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Kondratieff wave analysis, and appears to be much less supported</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the evidence than Kondratieff's theory. I wonder how many other</i><br>
<i>&gt;claims in Generations would look suspiscious if I checked them out</i><br>
<i>&gt;carefully.</i><br>
<p>
I think they may well be guilty of overreaching.  They give lots of<br>
good support for their basic generational mood theory, but then keep<br>
telling us how everything else under the sun correlates with their<br>
cycle.  And they probably haven't looked very carefully at all this<br>
other stuff.  <br>
<p>
I would have preferred they wrote an academic style book, making fewer<br>
claims and being more careful to defend them.  But that doesn't make<br>
them wrong about their core claims.  <br>
<p>
I encourage you and others to challenge them on such overreaches at<br>
the discussion section their web site.  They seem to reply there quite<br>
often.<br>
