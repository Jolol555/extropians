We should never forget Admiral "Amazing" Grace Hopper - and yes, I am told<br>
the moth is still in the logbook at Anapolis (sp?)  Their computer actually<br>
used electromechanical relays!  I do wish I had ever had the opportunity to<br>
see her speak - I understand she was (among other things) an excellent<br>
orator.<br>

They actually completed the diff (using hand-machined parts) but the<br>
complexity of the Anal. was beyond the machining ability of the time (too<br>
many parts to keep aligned.)<br>
