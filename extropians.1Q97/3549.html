<i>&gt; BTW, the SciAm article tells an interesting story. I always assumed that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Babbage never completed his inventions because he'd become obseesed with</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas for improvements that would of course delay project completion. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact he was held up by some of my EE professors in college as a classic</i><br>
<i>&gt; case of "creeping elegance" - "Don't let this happen to you!" Now I realize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that he couldn't get funding because he couldn't convince the British</i><br>
<i>&gt; government of the utility of such a machine - a different lesson altogether</i><br>
<i>&gt; and one entrepreneurs the world over can relate to, I think.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps is he hadn't wasted so much of his time trying to convince the King<br>
to steal his stake for him, but had appealed to real entrepreneurs across<br>
the Atlantic, things might have been different.  But then I wouldn't have<br>
expected a socialist propaganda rag like SciAm to see that angle.<br>
