<i>&gt; Some time ago someone mentioned Jefferson's belief that each generation</i><br>

<i>&gt;  a lot of wisdom encoded in parts of the law, and it would be inefficient</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to recreate that over and over.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But we don't have to.  People can read the old laws and re-enact the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  good ones.  The point is to force a reconsideration of the old</i><br>
<i>&gt;  structures, and in modern terms get around the public good problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (people won't organize to get rid of a bad law that hurts them          </i><br>
<i>&gt;  slightly).  Think of it as a forest fire: the useless brush and dying</i><br>
<i>&gt;  trees are consumed, the healthy live.  Similarly the laws with strong</i><br>
<i>&gt;  justifications would be re-enacted; dross would be pruned.</i><br>
<p>
One of the things I like best about this group is how bright the folks are<br>
who are attracted to extropianism and who participate on this list.  This<br>
often exhibits itself in a "convergent evolution" of memes, with people<br>
figurng out the same truths from different angles.  Damien's "forest fire"<br>
suggestion is a perfect example of this.  The idea of a defined end to the<br>
efficacy of a law or other government function, forcing the reconsideration<br>
of its value, is actually known in at least the theory of legislation, but<br>
unfortunately not very common in practice.  It is called "sunset", in a<br>
metaphor that really doesn't convey the worth of the idea as well as<br>
Damien's.<br>
<p>
I am by no means an expert on this subject, but do recall that the idea of<br>
"sunset" features in legislation became fashionable in the late 70s and know<br>
that at least some governmental agencies and functions have had sunset<br>
provisions written into their enabling legislation since then.  (I have a dim<br>
recollection that it may have been a minor buzzword in the policy lexicon of<br>
the Carter administration and know that it gets mentioned from time to time<br>
in the Texas legislature.)  But I can't think of any fundamental legislation<br>
(like codes governing basic commercial or social relations) or big or<br>
expensive governmental agencies that have serious sunset deadlines.  <br>
<p>
Furthermore, I can't think of any correlary of the sunset principle in any<br>
common law system of which I am aware.  Thus, for instance, in the common law<br>
regimes with which I am familiar, a principle of law is just that until it is<br>
affirmatively challenged and a conscious decision is made to change it.  In<br>
fact, the idea of a definite "lifespan" for a specific rule of law is quite<br>
foreign to the fundamentally ad-hoc and case-specific process of developing<br>
legal principles in the common law process.  Thus Damien's suggestion of a<br>
constitutional sunset or "forest fire" amendment would in fact be necessary,<br>
as a matter of legal theory and practice in our current system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  [snip Damien's specific proposal for a "forest fire" constitutional</i><br>
amendment.<br>
<p>
I think my criticism of the re-writing of all laws applies here: The cost of<br>
the disruption caused by the uncertainty of future legal principles that<br>
would come from repealing ALL legislation at once would likely outweigh the<br>
benefits from weeding out obsolete rules and regulations.  The intricate web<br>
of commercial and social relationships that make up life in society is<br>
premised in large part on a precitability of results from the legal system<br>
(even if those results are only NOTIONAL, i.e. the rules of decision in<br>
disputes aren't actually invoked in real disputes -- because the parties know<br>
the likely outcome of disputes).  This observation by no means undermines the<br>
great value of Damien's insight.  Adoption of sunset or forest fire<br>
principles as a fundamental feature of legislative and common law legal<br>
regimes, with gradual application across all rules of law, is a very, very<br>
good idea.  I just think a gradualist implementation would be more likely to<br>
capture the net benefits of such a legal tool.<br>
