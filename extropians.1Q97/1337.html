[Kathryn Aegis continues:]<br>
<i>&gt; My suggestion:  If you yourself are not furthering human sexuality </i><br>
<i>&gt; through experimentation or study, leave the subject to those who are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The focus of transhumanism is the future, not debating the dreary status </i><br>
<i>&gt; quo.  </i><br>
<p>
I continue to try and find a cure for being a teenager.  I find<br>
evolutionary psychology to be the key and necessary tool in that area. <br>
Although perhaps not yet a researcher in the area, I can hardly afford<br>
to leave the subject to those who are.  If you are seriously claiming<br>
that there are *no* inherent personality differences between male and<br>
female, it would place a substantial portion of my work on a level with<br>
Freudian psychoanalysis.<br>
<p>
This is a highly controversial area.  Even if you are a researcher<br>
[credentials?] and I am not, I don't think your particular and<br>
scientifically disputed viewpoint should reign unchallenged simply<br>
because you happen to be the only credentialed researcher on the list. <br>
Are you seriously stating that evolutionary psychology is now viewed as<br>
a baseless and failed experiment by the majority of gender-difference<br>
researchers?  I was strongly under the impression that it remained a<br>
controversial but viable hypothesis.<br>
<p>
In any case, if you're going to try and pull rank, I'm going to dump ALL<br>
the responsibility for presenting (and source-quoting) ALL sides of the<br>
argument on our friendly local accredited researcher.  Why should I hunt<br>
through my puny reference collection?  I've got a perfectly good<br>
researcher who, having pulled rank to get me to stop presenting my<br>
chosen point of view, would now seem obligated to present all<br>
controversial viewpoints in addition to her own.  So I leave it to you,<br>
Dr. Aegis, to explain to the breathless public the current scientific<br>
status of gender differences and evolutionary psychology.  Though of<br>
course I may, if I find your viewpoint too skewed, have to jump right<br>
back in (credentials or no) to ensure that scientific perspective is<br>
maintained.<br>
<p>
But as far as I can tell, the current situation is this:<br>
<p>
- Gender differentials are controversial;<br>
- Gender symmetry is controversial;<br>
- Evolutionary psychology is a beautiful hypothesis;<br>
- And everyone who isn't grinding an ax agrees that<br>
  BOTH genes AND the environment have something to do with it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, you don't state what year it was published or what level </i><br>
<i>&gt; of textbook it is.</i><br>
<p>
The Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, Fourth Edition:<br>
Copyright 1985.<br>
Around 2000 pages not including the index; highly technical.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The APA only last year removed homosexuality from </i><br>
<i>&gt; the list of sexual disorders, and new research on gender will change </i><br>
<i>&gt; even more approaches.</i><br>
<p>
I am not responsible for psychiatrists and their shamanistic prejudices;<br>
but for my decision to use (if not trust) their experimental data.<br>
