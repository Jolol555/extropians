<i>&gt; I know what's missing.  Hubris.  In nanotechnology and cryonics and</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence enhancement, and especially the Singularity, there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense of power and might and challenging the foundations of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Universe... challenging the gods, not just in the Greek tradition, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; that of the Tower of Babel.  </i><br>
<p>
Language transparency has been a pet project of mine for a long time.  <br>
Whoever gets there first holds the keys to the kingdom.  Rebuilding the <br>
Tower of Babel is the most important subject there is.  Rocket science <br>
is insignificant by comparison.  <br>
<p>
But consider:  if you knew how to do it, would you post the answer <br>
to the list?  I certainly wouldn't.  I'm not telling you everything I know, <br>
either;  far from it.  <br>
<p>
If you spend a few years thinking about what would be involved in <br>
writing software for language transparency, you end up with a <br>
different point of view about a lot of things.  I no longer think of this  <br>
as a hubristic project.  Almost the opposite.  Nor do I think of it as a <br>
step toward AI.  It's IA, and that's all it will ever be.  <br>

<i>&gt; Nanotechnology would overthrow "by the sweat of your brow</i><br>
<i>&gt; you shall eat bread" </i><br>
<p>
No.  Technology has already freed many of us from the need to sweat   <br>
to earn our bread.  The only time I sweat is when I am in the gym.  <br>
Nanotechnology will be just another step in an ongoing process of <br>
industrialization.  Technology (nano or macro) frees us from <br>
physical labor, but not from mental work.  (And now we start around <br>
the old familiar circle once again...  ) <br>
