Well, existing with no bodily sensations at all would probably be rather<br>
disturbing to a human (we are wired to constantly receive information; <br>
even in sleep we process body signals) and very counterproductive. What I<br>
would like is more like no distracting body sensations - no hunger, no<br>
feeling I have to change position, no itches etc., just a neutral feeling<br>
so that I could truly concentrate on the tasks at hand and had no need to<br>
stop until it was done (or I became bored). I can imagine working on some<br>
tasks (like web maintenance and growth) ceaselessly for several days with<br>
no need for hunger or sleep, and then a delightful vacation in<br>
corporeality with all its pleasures. <br>
<p>
Note that this doesn't necessarily require uploading; a good brainstem <br>
control system might do the trick. Maybe you could do your mental work <br>
while subprocessors exercised the body or did chores (the ultimate home <br>
robot!). <br>
