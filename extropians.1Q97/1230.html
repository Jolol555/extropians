There is some funny stuff in here.<br>

Thoughts on Science.<br>
<p>
<p>
The beguiling ideas about science quoted here were<br>
gleaned from essays, exams, and classroom discussions.  Most were<br>
from 5th and 6thgraders.  They illustrate Mark Twain's contention that<br>
the most interesting information comes from children, for they<br>
tell all they know, and then stop.<br>
<p>
Question:  What is horsepower?<br>
Answer: One horsepower is the amount of energy it takes<br>
to drag ahorse 500 feet in one second.<br>
<p>
You can listen to thunder after lightning and tell how<br>
close you came to getting hit.  If you don't hear it, you got hit.<br>
So, never mind.<br>
<p>
Talc is found in rocks and on babies.<br>
<p>
The law of gravity says, "No fair jumping without<br>
coming down."<br>
<p>
When they broke open molecules, they found they were<br>
stuffed with atoms.  But, when they broke open atoms, they found<br>
them stuffed with explosions.<br>
<p>
When people run around and around in circles, we say<br>
they are crazy. But, when planets do it, we say they are orbiting.<br>
<p>
Rainbows are just to look at, not to really understand.<br>
<p>
While the earth seems to be knowingly keeping its<br>
distance from the sun, it is really only centrificating.<br>
<p>
Someday we may discover how to make magnets that can<br>
point in any direction.<br>
<p>
South America has cold summers and hot winters, but<br>
somehow they still manage.<br>
<p>
Most books now say our sun is a star.  But it still<br>
knows how to change into a sun in the daytime.<br>
<p>
Water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees.<br>
There are 180  degrees between freezing and boiling because there are<br>
180 degrees between North and South.<br>
<p>
A vibration is a motion that cannot make up its mind<br>
which way it wants to go.<br>
<p>
There are 26 vitamins in all, but some of the letters<br>
are yet to be discovered.  Finding them all means living forever.<br>
<p>
There is a tremendous weight pushing down on the center<br>
of the Earth  because of so much population stomping around up there<br>
these days.<br>
<p>
Lime is a green tasting rock.<br>
<p>
Many dead animals in the past changed to fossils while<br>
others preferred to be oil.<br>
<p>
Genetics explain why you look like your father or if<br>
you don't, why you should.<br>
<p>
Vacuums are nothings.  We only mention them to let them<br>
know we know they're there.<br>
<p>
Some oxygen molecules help fires burn while others help<br>
make water, so sometimes it's brother against brother.<br>
<p>
We say the cause of perfume disappearing is<br>
evaporation.  Evaporation<br>
gets blamed for a lot of things we forgot to put the<br>
top on.<br>
<p>
To most people, solutions mean finding the answers.<br>
But to chemists,<br>
solutions are things that are still all mixed up.<br>
<p>
In looking at a drop of water under a microscope, we<br>
find there are<br>
twice as many H's as O's.<br>
<p>
Clouds are high flying fogs.  I'm not sure how the<br>
clouds get formed. But, the clouds know how to do it, so that is the<br>
important thing.<br>
<p>
Clouds just keep circling the earth around and around<br>
and around. There is not much else to do.<br>
<p>
Water vapor gets together in a cloud.  When it is big enough to be called a<br>
drop, it does.<br>
<p>
Humidity is the experience of looking for air and<br>
finding water.  We keep track of the humidity in the air so we won't drown<br>
when we breathe.<br>
<p>
Rain is often known as soft water, oppositely known as<br>
hail.<br>
<p>
Rain is saved up in cloud banks.<br>
<p>
In some rocks, you can find the fossil footprints of<br>
fishes.<br>
<p>
Cyanide is so poisonous that one drop of it on a dog's<br>
tongue will kill the stongest man.<br>
<p>
A blizzard is when it snows sideways.<br>
<p>
A hurricane is a breeze of bigly size.<br>
<p>
A monsoon is a French gentleman.<br>
<p>
Thunder is a rich source of loudness.<br>
<p>
Isotherms and isobars even more important than their<br>
names sound.<br>
<p>
It is so hot in some places, that the people there have<br>
to live in other places.<br>
<p>
The wind is like the air, only pushier.<br>
<p>
