<i>&gt;Well, I see some limitations to this, some of which are a bit subtle. I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have thousands of interests, and a profiler is limited to what I tell</i><br>
<i>&gt;it. It may do well with the interests which I express a lot, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot hope for it to detect my lesser interests.</i><br>
<p>
How can you say that? Push-technology has only recently entered the scene.<br>
And profiles CAN detect slight variations due to comparing your profile<br>
with other profiles highly similar to you. This will highly increase<br>
individuality because as you're compared against other profiles your slight<br>
interests will deviate even more away from other peoples, spontaneous<br>
orders will naturally cause differences and will cause wide ranges of<br>
individuality. With greater individuality you will lose accuracy though<br>
which will cause people to wander back out onto the web unless something<br>
better comes along such as metaverses (vr worlds) and this will also give<br>
time for AI developers to enhance AI to sort through all the junk on the<br>
net and create good search tools.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Another limitation is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that there are *always* implicit assumptions in such systems, based on</i><br>
<i>&gt;its design and the bias of its programmers. Would I really trust</i><br>
<i>&gt;Microsoft to build a profile which truly represents my values? I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;not.</i><br>
<p>
Algorithms are just formulas, how can numbers be biased? and Microsoft<br>
doesn't build the profile for you, you do. You just select content off the<br>
web you like and it's delivered to your screen constantly. You'd get the<br>
same thing if you put your browser on a constant refresh where you're<br>
continually downloading the website for the latest info. Third party<br>
providers like my-yahoo or firefly could be plugged into the system to<br>
compare profiles and make suggestions. Profiles may likely become a<br>
standard control panel item.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Since it seems that push technology is a blatantly commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt;aspect of the Net, And there's always the privacy issue. </i><br>
<p>
And commercialization is a bad thing? You can set things up legally so your<br>
profile remains private. Take a look at firefly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Finally, if I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;inundated with PT selections I will likely spend less of my time</i><br>
<i>&gt;browsing at random, effectively reducing my scope in the direction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the PT content.</i><br>
<p>
You don't browse at random already, you see a web address somewhere and you<br>
type it in or you use a search tool and find a website. The only time you<br>
browse at random is if you tell a search tool to give you a random link or<br>
you just pick a random word and goto www."randomword".com. There is nearly<br>
no such thing as random surfing. This mailinglist is an example of<br>
push-technology. You like it, you wanted more and the most recent<br>
information so you subscribed. If you nolonger like it anymore you can<br>
unsubscribe. This is exactly what push technology is except you can throw<br>
in commercials too. Take a look at PointCast Network, not the screensaver<br>
just the client. It's just news in web format, scrolling windows, scrolling<br>
tickers, etc. All this stuff can be done with java or activex if needed.<br>
It's nothing new except you can also have this stuff shown as a<br>
screensaver. Imagine having a computer screen with a window for incoming<br>
mail/faxes/voicemail on the left, a central window showing the news or<br>
video programming of your liking and maybe an advertisement or two (but you<br>
can bet they'll figure out ways to filter 'em out) and on the right window,<br>
the latest headlines of your liking. On the bottom half of the screen<br>
theres a webbrowser where when you click on a headline or a video playing<br>
in the video window the webbrowser will display more information on that topic.<br>
