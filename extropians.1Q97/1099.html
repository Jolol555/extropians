                  <br>
<p>
I did read Calvin's "The Throwing Madonna" a few years ago, I have not read <br>
his "The Cerebral Code", except for a few pages I thumbed through in a <br>
bookstore. The trouble I have with his idea is that throwing an object with <br>
power and accuracy is the most complex, difficult, motion you can put your <br>
arm through, it's hard to believe that it's also the first motion an arm was <br>
used for when it was no longer needed for locomotion, even modern humans are <br>
not very good at it. Baseball pitchers get paid millions of dollars because <br>
they have more natural ability at throwing things than 99.9% of the <br>
population, and they still miss the strike zone about as often as they hit it, <br>
and that's a lot bigger than most animals you would hunt, and it's not moving, <br>
and you're using aerodynamic baseballs not irregular rocks, and your brain is <br>
almost 5 times as big as Lucy's. Also, throwing hard creates a huge amount of <br>
ware and tare on the arm, after a few years of doing it for a living the arm <br>
is not of much use for anything, ask any old retired baseball pitcher, an old <br>
man of about 35.<br>
                    <br>

<i>                &gt;it seems that pre humans got along just fine as projectile                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;hunters using hand axes thrown discus style into groups of                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;animals at water holes/streams for millions of years.    </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
This might be true but could have nothing to do with the development of <br>
bipedalism. Lucy was as bipedal as you or me but it would be a million years <br>
later before anybody on earth had a hand ax or a tool of any sort.<br>
                  <br>
<p>
<i>                &gt;In such an environment, really good projectile throwing made                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;the difference between a line which left a lot of descendants                 </i><br>
<i>                &gt;and one which left none.  Calvin argues (very well I think)                </i><br>
<i>                &gt;that this is what drove the expansion of the human brain</i><br>
                   <br>
<p>
It seems to me that if Evolution was only interested in solving one <br>
particular problem, rather than problems in general, it would have developed <br>
an elaborate throwing reflex, not intelligence. Then again, Evolution never <br>
does things the easy sensible way, so maybe.<br>
