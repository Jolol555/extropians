This is an interesting point, "free will" to the extent that it "really"<br>
exists is by nature inscrutable, but on the other hand, if "reality" is <br>
ultimately deterministic (at least by my understanding of the word) then<br>
irregardless of any amount of chaos and complexity, there is absolutely<br>
nothing about our lives that isn't completely predestined, even the words <br>
we type in here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tell me what you mean by free will then we can talk about how much of it we </i><br>

<i>&gt; because that's nothing but pure randomness.</i><br>
<p>
This certainly sums up the problem with quantum mysticism.  A "free will" <br>
that's entirely random is not only of dubious benefit, but a "free will"<br>
that is not free to select an object of desire can hardly be called "free<br>
will" by any ordinary definition of the word.  Jack Sarfatti in his web site:<br>
<p>
   <a href="http://www.hia.com/hia/pcr">http://www.hia.com/hia/pcr</a><br>
<p>
makes a strong case that orthodox QM can not account for a free will that is<br>
in any way tied to perception, it is an argument that I strongly agree with.<br>
<p>
It's been a long winding road.  Traditionally we assumed we had free will,<br>
and then Newton discovered F = ma and we then grew to assume we didn't, and<br>
then De Broglie proposed that lambda = h/p, and again many people started <br>
assuming that free will may exist after all, and then Chalmers and others<br>
started noticing that with advanced action, QM can be reinterpreted as<br>
4-space standing waves without actually changing the math thus making clear<br>
that there is no obvious reason to assume that QM describes a reality that <br>
is anything other than fully determinstic.<br>
<p>
So where are we now?  Von Neumann's proof against determinism is long since<br>
dead, not only has the many worlds interpretation bypassed its logic, but<br>
Bell discovered in the 60s that it contained a mathematical blunder such<br>
that it only rules out determinism if reality operates by strictly local<br>
rules (Or in more modern terms, in a reality without the advanced action<br>
Chalmers talks about).<br>
<p>
So where does this lead.  Determinism again seems to be the name of the<br>
game, except that assumptions are still being made.  The biggest one is<br>
that the quantum vacuum (or maybe more accurately: "momentum-space") may<br>
turn out to not be in thermal equilibrium after all, something that will<br>
challenge Einsteinian causality far more seriously than existing QM does). <br>
<p>
I think the best guidance on this subject doesn't even come from physics,<br>
but from Godel; that it's safe to say that no intelligence can hope to<br>
even answer the question of whether "free will" exists -- unless that<br>
intelligence is transcendent to the realm its "free will" acts within.<br>
Of course this just leads to an infinite regression.<br>
<p>
As far as I can see "free will" and mysticism are automatically a package<br>
deal if we believe what Godel tells us.  Seems like a very definite value<br>
judgement has to be made as to the value of pursuing this package.<br>
