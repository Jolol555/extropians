<i>&gt;Although many thought Johnny Carwash's post an insult to transhumans,</i><br>
<i>&gt;normally I would ignore this type of scoff. However, out of respect to other</i><br>
<i>&gt;list members, I'll respond to the post. Being "trendy" is not my style, nor</i><br>
<i>&gt;do I honestly think it is a pastime of transhumans on this list. I set</i><br>
<i>&gt;trends, I don't follow them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;First of all, the idea of a human or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;posthuman or transhuman or anyotherprefixhuman with silicon skin isn't even</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a concept out of science fiction, it's a concept out of stupid people trying</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to be trendy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm amiss here.  I was referring to a bathing suit skin structure. Silicon</i><br>
<i>&gt;has various elements, according to my references. Because silicon dioxide,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or silica, has a low thermal coefficient of expansion, it is used in objects</i><br>
<i>&gt;subjected to wide ranges of heat and cold. And also, any of a group of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"semi-inorganic polymers based on the structural unit R2SiO, where R is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;organic group, characterized by wide-range thermal stability, high</i><br>
<i>&gt;lubricity, extreme water repellence, and physiological inertness and used in</i><br>
<i>&gt;adhesives, lubricants, protective coatings, paints, electrical insulation,</i><br>
<i>&gt;synthetic rubber, and prosthetic replacements for bodily parts."</i><br>
<p>
I didn't object so much to your idea, but to using it to represent the<br>
extropian movement and ideology. Silicon skin is a scifi cliche, and makes<br>
us look stupid. I realize this is a matter of symantics, but Silicon doesn't<br>
(and can't) have multiple elements, because it is an element (it does have<br>
multiple isotopes, but that's irrelevent). Indeed Silicon can form different<br>
compounds, among them Silicon Dioxide. Silicon Dioxide is also found in<br>
quartz sand, and was recently been found to be the cause of the "singing<br>
sands" phenomenon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;The crystals of pure silicon (Si) used as semiconductor chips</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;are used for the semiconductor properties of silicon. In addition, silicon's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;crystaline lattice structure is very rigid (another reason it's used for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;chips .. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You do have a point here, and one to consider from the perspective you</i><br>
<i>&gt;offer.  However, it is limited in scope. Perhaps I could have spent more</i><br>
<i>&gt;time in my post emphasizing what skin textures I will be presenting, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;that was *not* the intent of the post, clearly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;(Note:  these images will in no way be gender biased.  In fact, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;pre-production are men, and other genders.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think that the images are kingdom biased! What about plants? eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Paramecium have a right to exist!! Don't they? .. speciesist ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This manner is childish and silly. How can any comment you make be taken</i><br>
<i>&gt;earnestly when you lash out in what reads to be emotional wrath? It doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;establish a sympathetic view of you.</i><br>
<p>
Well, first of all the kingdoms of life thing was a joke, humour, sarcasm?<br>
And it was emotional wrath, it really hurts me that you don't distinguish<br>
between the real future and an imagined future. I consider myself an<br>
extropian in that I believe that we can only improve our lives through<br>
science and technology. What I don't believe is that we should make the<br>
future look incredibly alien. The future is never alien. 5000 years ago,<br>
society had more in common with today's society than it does different. It's<br>
blind theorizing like that which makes all future oriented people look foolish. <br>
<p>
This will be my only other reply. If you got offended, if I shook your ivory<br>
towers at the root, too bad. Guess what, there's always going to be people<br>
who disagree, and to the guy who was afraid I'd "smother" his movement with<br>
my "pessimism", I say, WAKE UP! Guess what, the future won't be that much<br>
fun. With increased power comes increased responsibility. The price of<br>
liberty is constant vigilance. If you only look at one side of it, you can't<br>
see anything, ok? If I could smother the entire extropian movement (Which I<br>
consider myself a part of) by expressing one contrary idea, well, let's just<br>
say it's on shaky ground to begin with. <br>
<p>
Can I suggest you all go take a refresher course in chemistry and physics? <br>
