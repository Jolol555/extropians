<i>&gt; [Scare story about malnourished British children]</i><br>
<i>&gt; To those of you who haven't already noticed: Yeah, I'm a cynic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Erik</i><br>
<p>
And gullible too.  What actual evidence (you say nothing but "A<br>
British Study") do you have that those children are malnourished<br>
because of lack of government intervention, and what assumptions<br>
were made in that study?<br>
<p>
Secondly, it does not surprise me that a people with a long<br>
history of opposition to individual rights and responsibility<br>
would look at malnourished children and blame the state, rather<br>
than those actually responsible for the chilren: parents.  Why<br>
do you not look at this as a moral problem, rather than as a<br>
political one?  Are there no /people/ in the UK willing to take<br>
on the responsibility for these children's care that their<br>
parents have shirked?  And if there are such people, is the<br>
government getting in the way of their doing it?<br>
