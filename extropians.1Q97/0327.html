Imnsho, this thread (which, afair was originated by the works, and not by <br>
the publically mouthed opinions of one de Garis) shows classically the <br>
disruptive role of PC in argumentation (which is also the intended effect <br>
of PC), the reason why the term has had aquired full bugbear status (at <br>
least to me) in an rationally led argumentation by now.<br>
<p>
PC is an argumentative technique, where inadequately (according to their <br>
lights) represented groups try to discredit their opponents by applying <br>
emotionally loaded, ad hominish argumentation ("perfectly obvious... you <br>
are a Commie/Nazi/paedophile if you think XY").<br>
<p>
The scientific work of de Garis is not connected to his world views at <br>
all. Perhaps, we should discuss the instrumentality of CAM-flavoured <br>
systems in artificial cognition, not whether the person de Garis eats <br>
baby bacon crisps for breakfast. <br>
