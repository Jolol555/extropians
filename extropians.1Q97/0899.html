Intel is giving away MMX code for high-speed signal processing.<br>
<p>
See <a href="http://developer.intel.com/drg/mmx/tools/splibds.htm">http://developer.intel.com/drg/mmx/tools/splibds.htm</a><br>
<p>
One thing I'd really love to have is a utility for converting CD <br>
audio (and .WAV) audio files (or buffers) into arrays of <br>
high-resolution sprectrograms in a simple format.<br>
<p>
With this information, I'd like to generate animations such as <br>
kaleidoscopes and 3-D fly-throughs of sound space (perhaps rendered <br>
with complex combinations of color/concept sorted object images).<br>
<p>
Such utility would also enable the creation of higher-level utilities <br>
such as speech analysis, audio-to-MIDI conversions, song libraries <br>
sorted by tempo and timbre, derivative music based on original music <br>
(where instruments are translated or augmented with additional <br>
instruments and effects), real-time feedback systems for vocal <br>
training and machine-mediated melody creation, speech-based web <br>
interaction, demographic classification based on linguistic patterns, <br>
and virtual musical instruments based on biomechanical input.<br>
<p>
As an experiment, it would be interesting to pursue this project <br>
openly.  This might spark some popularizing of advanced technology <br>
through entertaining applications of science.<br>
