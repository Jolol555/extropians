If someone is a reasonable person, then the fact that they have come<br>
to some opinion is information to you.  It is an important clue. <br>
Are you saying there are only a handful of people among the billions<br>
in our world whose opinions would affect yours?  If so, you must think<br>
there are very few reasonable people in the world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; However, others tend to think of our social systems as fragile and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interdependent, </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your existence is the argument against that view.  Your ancestors</i><br>
<i>&gt;made it through ice ages, famines, wars, and technological changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;no less dramatic in their time than our ideas are in ours.  ...</i><br>
<p>
Evolution gives a vast selection effect.  Most competitors to our<br>
ancenstors do not have many descendants today.  And "making it<br>
through" enough to leave descendants is not great comfort, given how<br>
so many of those people suffered so badly.  <br>
