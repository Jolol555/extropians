Elyse Tanouye writes about a "Long Shot: A few AIDS Vaccines Are Ready <br>
for Testing; Now, Who Goes First?" in today's Wall Street Journal.  It <br>
seems like there are several pithy issues in here that Extropians <br>
might want to chew on.<br>
<p>
The article notes that the fields of AIDS research and treatment are <br>
polarizing between "'empiricists,' who take a 'learn as we go' tack <br>
and urge the start of wide-scale human tests now," versus "the <br>
'rationalists,' [who argue] that to begin human testing would be <br>
unethical and a waste of scarce resources until researchers discover <br>
far more about the interaction of HIV and the immune system."<br>
<p>
This polarization further affects the economics: Such vaccines are <br>
incredibly expensive to produce; the majority of people suffering from <br>
AIDS can't afford the treatments; yet, once vaccines are produced, <br>
everyone will claim a right to be treated.  While governments have <br>
poured billions into research, only minimal progress has been made. <br>
 Meanwhile, commercial pharmaceutical firms have no incentive to throw <br>
their full resources into the effort.<br>
<p>
AIDS vaccines are, perhaps, one of the most complex areas of <br>
scientific (and social) research because HIV is such a special virus: <br>
it doesn't just attack any old organ, it attacks the human immune <br>
system itself.  So, researchers "must tackle the seemingly impossible <br>
task of inducing an immune system response that works better than the <br>
natural one."<br>
<p>
We sometimes assume that if we can just upload our minds, we'll be all <br>
set for immortality.  Besides issues of memetic propagation, as well <br>
as concerns about 'computer' bugs and viruses in an uploaded society <br>
of minds, or runaway nano-goo plagues in the physical substrate, <br>
mental plasticity and intelligence augmentation may also need to <br>
borrow heavily from immunology and what we're currently learning in <br>
the battle against AIDS.  Even, for those who will prefer to download <br>
into a fresh organic body when they reach a new planet somewhere, <br>
being able to resist any local pathogens may be an even bigger initial <br>
concern than establishing an industrial base.<br>
