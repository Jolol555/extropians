<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Eugene Leitl</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;    I'll give you a different problem to worry about...  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; people of all ages today who are falling off the technological</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; bandwagon.  Those who manage to stay on the tiger (Mixed metaphores?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; Why not?), are getting further and further ahead of those not on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; board.  Will there be a point at which no one not already on the train</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; can get on?  Sure looks like it.  That is the problem I worry about.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;I agree. While I certainly find transhumanism and progress worthwhile even</i><br>
<i>&gt;if they will be used by a smaller subset of humanity, I would like to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;it accessible to everyone. Maybe I'm a bleeding heart transhumanist :-)</i><br>
<p>
I think there's room for cautious...dynamic!...optimism.  UIs do get<br>
gradually nicer.  Software that does sensible and useful things comes out<br>
a little at a time.  Hey, with a little prompting people could adopt Java<br>
and maybe some good simple security models and get rid of a layer of OS<br>
and mega-app stupidity.  I paid $300 for the (used) color laptop with<br>
built-in modem that I'm working on.  Hopeful signs, I mean.<br>
<p>
I think there's an argument that in general, the more advanced an economy,<br>
the *easier* it is to get involved in.  The most "advanced" people are<br>
pushing diminishing returns, and all the tools (&amp; economies of scale)<br>
that are mass-produced to help them do that are even more useful to the<br>
"have nots".  Okay maybe not *air tight*, but it's an *argument*, all right?<br>
<p>
[Btw, just thought of a really nasty quip about "post-scarcity":<br>
 Post-scarcity is an idea thought up by people who don't understand<br>
 economics and hope that the singularity will save them from having to!]<br>
<p>
Another way of looking at it is, if this stuff is so confusing to learn,<br>
it's not very "advanced," is it?  I don't think so.  It's actually another<br>
reassuring sign, that after watching a couple decades of apocalyptic hype,<br>
you start to notice that things change at a rather leisurely pace after<br>
all!  After a while, massive stupidity impedes its own advance.<br>
<p>
I'm another "bleeding heart transhumanist" for whom clarity for people is<br>
one of the most important goals I can see this side of the singularity.<br>
