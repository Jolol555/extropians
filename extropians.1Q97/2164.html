<i>&gt; &gt; In my personal ethical system, I regard complex, diverse systems as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fundamental good (this is a completely arbitrary basis, but it works quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; well). This of course implies that a biosphere is something *very*</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; valuable, and that keeping it viable and diverse is an ethical act. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; also implies that ideally, I should not interfere in it to decrease its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (long run) diversity, and that to achieve this I should also try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; convince others about the same thing (see the meme? :-). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about interfering to increase its diversity?  Should we seek out</i><br>
<i>&gt; forests which are dominated by one kind of tree, and strive to introduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; competitors?  Irrigate the desert?</i><br>
<p>
What is more diverse, a djungle and a desert, or two djungles? As I see <br>
it, even if a desert is rather sparse, it contains its own unique <br>
lifeforms that are much more different from the lifeforms of the djungle <br>
than any two comparable djungle lifeforms will ever be. I'm sure this can <br>
be put more stringently, but that is the general idea.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This seems different from traditional environmentalism.  Environmentalists</i><br>
<i>&gt; would usually seek to preserve even rather stark ecosystems.</i><br>
<p>
That is true. There are many kinds of environmentalism. Some (perhaps the<br>
loudest) want to preserve nature as it was without any human influence (of<br>
course, then we would have to bring back the wooly mammoths :-), beliving<br>
this state to be optimal in some sense (and hence implying that humans<br>
have a negative moral value; not healthy). A more reasonable approach is<br>
the "harmony with nature" idea, which can range from the extreme to the<br>
downright tame. Then there is what I would call the "playing together with<br>
nature" school which I regard myself in: humans play an active role in<br>
nature, let's make the best of it. I'm sure there are many who dislike<br>
this view. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps technology will soon vastly outdo nature in generation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; diversity, comparable to the degree by which rockets outpace cougars.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our nanites and computers will create ecosystems far exceeding the</i><br>
<i>&gt; complexity and diversity nature has been able to clumsily stumble upon in</i><br>
<i>&gt; its few billion years of undirected evolution.  If so, then demolishing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rain forests and replacing them with the ultra-exotic designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; ecosystems of the future may be the road to maximal diversity.  I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; think we'll sign up many traditional environmentalists for this program.</i><br>
<p>
Hardly any. In my opinion, I would still think a world with both <br>
rainforests and digital diamond coral reefs would be richer than just a <br>
world covered with the reefs.<br>
<p>
I also think it is quite possible we will reach this state. In my studies <br>
of jupiter brains one thing is sure: there is room for *tremendous* <br>
diversity in powerful computing systems. Imagine a Dyson sphere <br>
containing nanocomputers, all of them running an interconnected digital <br>
biosphere at high speed...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The February 1997 issue of Wired has a nice article on Julian Simon and</i><br>
<i>&gt; his refutations of environmental catastrophism.  I am optimistic that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the continual failures of the apocalyptic predictions will eventually sink</i><br>
<i>&gt; in, and that in the next decade we will see a retreat from environmentalism.</i><br>
<p>
Ha! You think people will be that rational? Just remember the number of <br>
times Jehova's Witnesses predicted the end of the world at the turn of <br>
the century, and they are still around...<br>
<p>
Environmentalism has been retreating lately at least here in Sweden, but<br>
that is mostly due to bad economy. If you have a job, you can afford to<br>
worry about nature, but if it is a choice between unemployment and a tree,<br>
guess what people choose? <br>
