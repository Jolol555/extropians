I recommend Brian Eno's new book, "A YEAR with swollen appendices".<br>
It's his diary from 1995, with articles added at the end.<br>
ideas (lots)<br>
events (interesting)<br>
reminiscences<br>
his two daughters<br>
wife/manager<br>
their company<br>
his friends (lots, but including Bowie, U2, Stewart Brand...)<br>
trips to lots of places<br>
London, New York, Bosnia<br>
producing records<br>
rule-generated art and music<br>
the meaning, purpose and value of art and style<br>
how to make creativity happen<br>
defence [sic] spending as a way to hide command economy within "capitalism"<br>
"Why am I doing this?  Why am I doing this?"<br>
computer software (he thinks most of what exists is crap)<br>
user interfaces (likewise)<br>
CD ROMs (likewise)<br>
KidPix (NOT crap)<br>
Stained Glass (likewise, but discontinued by Berkely Systems)<br>
magnifying body parts in PhotoShop<br>
Art shows, installations, museums, curators<br>
a wild fashion show<br>
evolution<br>
War in Yugoslavia<br>
War Child and other aid projects<br>
<p>
Btw, don't expect a libertarian.<br>
