Gregory Houston wrote 2/14/97: &lt;Our theoris progress, shouldn't our<br>
terminology also?&gt;<br>
<p>
Our theories progress towards what?  Where are they going?<br>
<p>
&lt;Perhaps the term truth is not yet archaic or obsolete, but I imagine it<br>
will one day be so. It merely requires that enough people find it<br>
neccessary for more *useful* terminology.&gt;<br>
<p>
Omega posted cogently a bit ago about willy-nilly redefinitions coming out<br>
of the incoherent, passé, compost-modern stance that truth is either<br>
relative or doesn't matter: "[H]aving an agreed upon meaning for words is<br>
already a difficult enough problem in our society without people going<br>
around redefining words on the fly.  ...[T]his kind of redefinition<br>
[raises] the signal to noise ratio within our society's communication.... <br>
[T]he redefinition you espouse is being hyped by one very well defined and<br>
fairly narrow segment of our culture to the detriment of the general<br>
ability of our culture to communicate within itself."<br>
<p>
&lt;Your argument is that if I deny truth then I am embracing what is false.<br>
This is not the case. This is the same sort of thinking that says if I<br>
deny God, then I embrace satan.&gt;<br>
<p>
No, this is not the same thinking.  Truth is not relative, no matter how<br>
hard many individuals today try to pretend it is in order to lie with<br>
impunity.  Totally contradictory events do not occur simultaneously in the<br>
exactly the same place; only one thing happens at a time, what actually<br>
happens is true.  Only one thing at a time happened at each instant in the<br>
past, each actually occurring instant is true.  Things that didn't happen,<br>
or that aren't happening right now, are false.  The concepts of true and<br>
false do not apply to future events; prediction, conjecture, promises and<br>
the like do.  If you are going to embrace the idea that utterly<br>
contradictory things occur in exactly the same place at exactly the same<br>
time, down there at the microcausal or Planck moment level, then you can<br>
say nothing logical at all.  You can only spout fluff, aka lies.  You can<br>
speak to your relationship with Satan better than I can, so I'll leave that<br>
to you.<br>
<p>
&lt;When I deny one pole of a dichotomy, I do not embrace its opposite. I deny<br>
the dichotomy entirely.&gt;<br>
<p>
Whoop-de-do.  If you are not telling "the truth, the whole truth, and<br>
nothing but the truth" about what has actually happened or what is actually<br>
happening, you are lying.  Saying that utility is preferable to truth is an<br>
open invitation to barbaric behavior.  It is quite frequently useful to<br>
lie, does that alone make it right to lie?  With your cavalier disregard<br>
for truth, I wouldn't like you in my jury box, on my witness stand, or<br>
doing business with me.<br>
<p>
&lt;I can be honest without ever having to refer to the concept of truth...&gt;<br>
<p>
Honest?  How do I know you're telling me the truth?<br>
<p>
&lt;This is honesty qua usefulness rather than honesty qua truth. It still<br>
works.&gt;<br>
<p>
I have seen quite clearly on the barbaric streets of many urban centers<br>
that it most emphatically does not work.<br>
<p>
&lt;No one can be absolutely honest, but by degree, the person focused on<br>
usefulness, will be more honest, more free, more in control of<br>
self--emotively and thus cognitively--than the person focused on truth.&gt;<br>
<p>
I have been proud to know many individuals to be absolutely honest in many<br>
situations.  Whatever sense you are using "absolutely" above, is useless to<br>
me.  A focus on utility rather than on truth leads quickly to nihilistic<br>
barbarism which produces only the illusion of self-control and freedom. <br>
The chaotic world outside that such a focus produces, severely limits the<br>
courses of action open to you in favor of an over-concentration in your<br>
time-energy budget on personal defense; and undercuts any incentive for<br>
self-control to develop, in favor of attempting to appropriate whatever<br>
appears to be useful to you at the moment.  The truth will set you free. <br>
Utility alone will enslave you; often without your recognition of the bars<br>
surrounding you due to the self-delusion fostered by the turn away from<br>
truth.<br>
<p>
&lt;If I am bored and useless its my own fault.&gt;<br>
<p>
Let's say you've been involved in an accident through no fault of your own,<br>
or you've gotten very old and sick through no fault of your own, and you're<br>
confined to a hospital bed, on life support, totally paralyzed but still<br>
mentally functioning.  If you were bored and useless, it would not be your<br>
fault.  This idea that your mental states or levels of functionality are<br>
all your own fault is New Age religious claptrap, pure nonsense.<br>
<p>
&lt;Confusion has to do with knowledge, but what I am speaking about in this<br>
example is about subconscious emotions that *we* are unaware of. Did you<br>
deny that you have a subconscious? Are you completely aware of all that<br>
motivates you?&gt;<br>
<p>
Confusion could have to do with knowledge, but more usefully, it has to do<br>
with holding conflicting purposes in your consciousness.  Not conflicting<br>
emotions, but the purposes that produced the emotions in conjunction with<br>
the on-going actual events both inside and outside your head.  Emotions<br>
don't conflict in the absence of purposes which, if achieved, would produce<br>
conflicting actual events.  As far as I am aware, I am completely aware of<br>
all that motivates me.  I deny that I have a subconscious that cannot be<br>
made conscious by directing my attention appropriately.  This is just a<br>
"spectrum of focus" issue, see David Gelernter's "Muse in the Machine"<br>
(1993) on this idea.  Also, see John Searle's "The Rediscovery of the Mind"<br>
(1993) for a conclusive refutation of the possibility of the existence of a<br>
subconscious not accessible to the conscious mind.  Forget Freud, and all<br>
his fellow-traveler crudballs.<br>
<p>
&lt;I am intrested in a MUCH BROADER spectrum of consciousness which includes<br>
emotions. I will call this broader spectrum "information". I do not feel<br>
the term information limits me to the purely cognitive that epistemology<br>
does.&gt;<br>
<p>
You can call it "information" if you "feel" like it, but without<br>
consciousness, who is the knower in conjunction with the known, that<br>
actually makes it information?  Absent the conscious, subjective self,<br>
please make a rational argument that information has any meaning at all.<br>
<p>
&lt;When you are focused on truth and knowledge alone, you deny the greater<br>
portion of your consciousness. Its like looking through a little peep hole<br>
on<br>
reality without ever feeling its presence.&gt;<br>
<p>
You don't deny it, you just aren't using it at the moment.  Certainly there<br>
other aspects of reality we can focus on that also use our consciousness,<br>
we just are constrained by our attention mechanism from doing everything<br>
possible at once.  None of us can ever look at more than a little peep hole<br>
on reality no matter what we do, so what?<br>
<p>
&lt;Much of my confusion regarding your stand on emotive "intelligence" could<br>
have been reduced if there were some extropian documents which made an<br>
honest effort to deal with this issue.&gt;<br>
<p>
I touch quite a bit on emotive intelligence in my essay on "Consciousness",<br>
Part I in "Extropy" #14 and Part II in "Extropy" #15.  Also, in my history<br>
paper on the extropy web site under "Extro^2 Proceedings" you will find<br>
quite a bit on it, even to the point of inextricably linking the concept of<br>
progress to emotional meaning.  Also, see the "Extropian Art Manifesto" of<br>
Natasha More's.  She writes: "We are achieving refined emotions through<br>
forward thinking and analytical techniques."  To which I replied: "...A<br>
lifting up - ascension - above the coarse fabric of today's orthodox<br>
media-driven pop culture.  A simultaneous challenge to our maximum<br>
emotional capacities coupled with an anchor in the aesthetic criteria of<br>
what went before - we stand on shoulders of artistic genius, and we<br>
simultaneously look upward and forward into new vistas; and downward and<br>
backward with gratitude and a sense of measuring up to those whose vision<br>
and sacrifice brought us to the present.  A rich and heady mix of emotions,<br>
difficult to maintain, the 'liquid realm'."<br>
<p>
&lt;I am expressing a view that emotive issues are now "the great missing<br>
piece in Extropian philosophy."&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, do your homework first before you express views like this.  Of<br>
course, if you have no desire to attain truth, I guess you can express just<br>
about any view you want to, but do they mean anything?<br>
<p>
&lt;Reality changes, there is no absolute reality, so how could there be an<br>
absolute truth. How can we seek absolute truth, something that is suppose<br>
to accord with reality, when reality itself is not absolute and<br>
unchanging.&gt;<br>
<p>
What your confusion boils down to, is that your metaphysical presupposition<br>
expressed above, your religious belief, if you will, or even worse, your<br>
absolute truth, is unintelligible and incoherent.  This Heraclitean<br>
idealism quickly falls off the cliff into the nihilistic abyss.  If you do<br>
not begin with an aim to realism, your whole worldview stays vaporous,<br>
unanchored to anything at all.<br>
