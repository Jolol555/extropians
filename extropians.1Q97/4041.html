<i>&gt; Lee's argument for leaving the (C) off could work in some cases, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably not in many others.  It has to be the case that the extra</i><br>
<i>&gt; distribution which the works would receive by being unrestricted would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have considerable benefit.  This benefit has to be great enough that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even though it is probably spread out through the whole society, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; portion which applies to the original author of the works will be greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; than what he would have received had he controlled the distribution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An example of this might be some of the Gnu software.  Perhaps the</i><br>
<i>&gt; authors of the Gnu C compiler receive more direct benefit from the existence</i><br>
<i>&gt; of programs built using that compiler than they would have received had</i><br>
<i>&gt; they charged for it.</i><br>
<p>
I should point out that Gnu software is hideously restricted--it is the<br>
farthest thing from my vision, and that he touts "freedom" with it is<br>
unpardonable hypocrisy.  Stallman is a socialist merely trading one set<br>
of chains for another.  Gnu software is subject to a restrictive license<br>
that forbids many uses, most of which would be the natural uses to which<br>
a commercial enterprise would otherwise put it.<br>
