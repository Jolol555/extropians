<i>&gt; And I've just been told that colonizing Venus is impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Difficult as hell, yes, quite literally.  Impossible?  </i><br>
<p>
An interesting notion.<br>
1)  Can hell be terraformed?<br>
2)  If not, what would be required to live there?<br>
<p>
This could be a really weird story.<br>
<p>
For the classic "lake of sulfer" scenario, you'd need powerful<br>
refrigerators and maybe little cabins floating on the lake.  Would there<br>
be any way, with modern technology, to put a research station *beneath*<br>
the lake?  For power, we can use the temperature differential between<br>
the lake and the plain of ice in the Ninth Circle.<br>
<p>
Would there be any motive for colonizing hell?  My copy of *Inferno*<br>
doesn't show much in the way of natural resources.<br>
<p>
What would be required to terraform Hell?  Since Hell is infinite (?) it<br>
beats a Dyson sphere for living space, and in any case I think that we<br>
should do our best to ensure a happy afterlife even for the morally<br>
challenged.  I believe that the flatterers were supposed to be wading<br>
through excrement, so we have plenty of fertilizer.  The classic problem<br>
of producing oxygen doesn't apply; what we need is to give Hell a<br>
self-sustaining livable ecology.  Are there any plants that put roots<br>
down in molten sulfer?  If the sulfer is self-heating, or the plain of<br>
ice is self-cooling, we can drop chunks of ice into the lake - the<br>
question remains; what will live on even cooled sulfur?<br>
<p>
The best route might be (in the case of the lake) pump out sulfer,<br>
transmute it to scrith, and build Ringworlds.  We can also use it as a<br>
sort of giant combination garbage dump, heat sink, shock absorber, fuel<br>
source, or even momentum absorber (something to push off of).  Imagine<br>
the spaceship of the future:  A living capsule with a pentagram on the<br>
bottom.<br>
<p>
Hell might actually be most useful in terraforming other planets.  If we<br>
open a hole in the lake of fertilizer, we could turn dust into soil in a<br>
snap.  The plain of ice supplies water, although at a higher<br>
transportation cost (they have to be cut loose, you can't just open a<br>
hole).  The lake of boiling blood (for the violent) could supply water<br>
more directly, and even some extra nutrients.<br>
