<p>
I don't either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;really get into these comparisons, the statistics are overwhelming. Genius is</i><br>
<i>&gt;male - period.</i><br>
<p>
And here's where I lose my respect for de Garis.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What I find truly contemptible of my two (ex)colleagues is their</i><br>
<i>&gt;closed-mindedness towards the idea that genius is</i><br>
<i>&gt;male.</i><br>
<p>
And here's where de Garis find him truly contemptible.<br>
<p>
He seems to see no difference in genius as "predominantly male", and genius<br>
being "male-dominated". He doesn't seem comfortable with the "mostly but<br>
not all" way of things, and he doesn't seem comfortable with giving others<br>
the benefit of the doubt. What's worse, he seems to believe that this point<br>
of view is more "scientific" or "intellectually honest". Maybe someone<br>
should send him a copy of Korzbyski's "Science and Sanity"?<br>
<p>
In reality, one can only say loose things like, "In this study, 45 per cent<br>
of the red-headed persons did such-and-such, and 20 percent did so-and-so,<br>
and 35 percent behaved otherwise." A sentence like "Genius is male" has no<br>
meaning.<br>
<p>
Obviously, he's writing poetry, not science. His purpose? Probably to make<br>
himself feel better for owning a penis. Poetry doesn't need to be<br>
reasonable.<br>
