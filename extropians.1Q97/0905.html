<i>&gt;. The lunar mass driver designed</i><br>
<i>&gt; by O'Niel was long enough for people to ride comfortably, with maximum</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gs of less than 9. It was over 75 km long.</i><br>
<p>
This isn't right.  The acceleration in O'Neill's mass driver was much <br>
higher that that.  Heck, I think the 3rd prototype at SSI hit 200+ <br>
gees.  It was also designed to launch payloads much smaller than<br>
a person (a few kilograms at a time, at a high rep rate, with the <br>
buckets being decelerated and recycled.)<br>
<p>
The long length you may be thinking of is the post-acceleration <br>
phase, where the packets are tweaked electrostatically or <br>
magnetically  to remove small velocity errors (this is needed to make<br>
the mass catcher sufficiently small).<br>
