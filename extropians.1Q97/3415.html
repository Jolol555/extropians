<i>&gt;        ...And the turtle retreats back into his shell, looks to his sky and</i><br>
<i>&gt;sees limitations where there truly are none.  Perhaps one day, the turtle</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be willing to take another peek at the unlimited "beyond" outside of</i><br>
<i>&gt;his shell...</i><br>
<p>
This is just pure arrogance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        In other words, we have *every* right to judge you as you are the</i><br>
<i>&gt;creator of your ideas.  Your first impression was a breach of respect</i><br>
<i>&gt;towards Natasha.  Instead of apologizing or responding to another thread,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you (yes *you* Mr. Carwash) decided to persist in your ideas that *we* are</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong and *you* are right.  You have judged us, and now you whine about how</i><br>
<i>&gt;we can't judge you?  Sorry, you've lost your rights.</i><br>
<p>
First of all, I did not insult Natasha as a person, I just disagreed with<br>
her idea. Secondly, I did not judge you, plural, I gave my opinion on *a*<br>
poster, singular. The only judgement I have about you is that you're a<br>
suck-up and a yes man. Next time you express an independent thought come<br>
back to me, ok? In the mean time, don't start creating "sides" in an issue<br>
where there are none. If you want to be part of something where everyone is<br>
in constant agreement, go join a religious cult, because last time I<br>
checked, there was something in extropia that encouraged the free exchange<br>
of ideas, popular or not. There's no *we* buddy, only you.<br>
