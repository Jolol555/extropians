The thread on intellectual property is getting down to the "nuts and bolts"<br>
of whether the concept of property is properly applied to these 'ideal<br>
objects'.  I thought that the comments of some past writers on this subject<br>
might be of interest to the list. Here's an article by the anarchist writer<br>
Benjamin Tucker which raises some of the same issues.<br>

                THE CRIMINALITY OF PATENT AND COPYRIGHT LAWS<br>
<p>
		      	    by Benjamin Tucker    <br>
<p>
The laws of Patent and Copyright are the means by which the State, that<br>
greatest of criminal and tyranical monopolies, grants special monopolistic<br>
privileges to a few at the expense of the many by protecting inventors and<br>
authors against competition for a period long enough to enable them to<br>
extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labour measure<br>
of their services. The abolition of these monopolies would fill their<br>
beneficiaries with a wholesome fear of competition which would cause them to<br>
be satisfied with pay for their services equal to that which other labourers<br>
get for theirs, and to secure it by placing their products and works on the<br>
market at the outset at prices so low that their lines of business would be<br>
no more tempting to competitors than any other lines.   <br>
<p>
The Patent and Copyright monopolies are a species of property rights which<br>
depend for their legitimacy on the subtle notion of "property in ideas". The<br>
defenders of such property set up an analogy between the production of<br>
material things and the production of abstractions, and on the strength of<br>
it declare that the manufacturer of mental products, no less than the<br>
manufacturer of material products, is a labourer worthy of his hire. So far,<br>
so good. But, to make out their case, they are obliged to go further, and to<br>
claim, in violation of their own analogy, that the labourer who creates<br>
mental products, unlike the labourer who creates material products, is<br>
entitled to exemption from competition. Because the Lord, in his wisdom, or<br>
the Devil, in his malice, has so arranged matters that the inventor and the<br>
author produce naturally at a disadvantage, man, in his might, proposes to<br>
supply the devine or diabloic deficiency by an artificial arrangement that<br>
shall not only destroy this disadvantage, but actually give the inventor and<br>
author an advantage that no labourer enjoys, - an advantage, moreover, which<br>
in practice, goes, not to the inventor and the author, but to the promoter<br>
and the publisher and the monopolist.    <br>
<p>
Convincing as the argument for property in ideas may seem at first hearing,<br>
if you think about it long enough, you will begin to be supicious. The first<br>
thing, perhaps, to arouse your suspicion will be the fact that none of the<br>
champions of such property propose the punishment of those who violate it,<br>
contenting themselves with subjecting the offenders to the risk of damage<br>
suits, and that nearly all of them are willing that even the risk of suit<br>
shall disappear when the proprietor has enjoyed his right for a certain<br>
number of years. Now, if, as the French writer, Alphonse Karr, remarked,<br>
property in ideas is a property like any other property, then its violation,<br>
like the violation of any other property, deserves criminal punishment, and<br>
its life, like that of any other property, should be secure in right against<br>
the lapse of time. And, this not being claimed by the upholders of property<br>
in ideas, the suspicion arises that such a lack of the courage of their<br>
conviction may be due to an instinctive feeling that they are wrong.    <br>
<p>
I take it that, if it were possible, and if it had always been possible, for<br>
an unlimited number of individuals to use to an unlimited extent and in an<br>
unlimited number of places the same concrete things at the same time, there<br>
never would have been any such thing as the institution of property. Under<br>
those circumstances the idea of property would never have entered the human<br>
mind, or, at any rate, if it had, would have been summarily dismissed as too<br>
gross an absurdity to be seriously entertained for a moment. Had it been<br>
possible for the concrete creation or adaptation  resulting from the efforts<br>
of a single individual to be used contemporaneously by all individuals,<br>
including the creator or adapter, the realization, or impending realization,<br>
of this possiblity, far from being seized upon as an excuse for a law to<br>
prevent the use of this concrete thing without the consent of its creator or<br>
adapter, and far from being guarded against as an injury to one, would have<br>
been welcomed as a blessing to all,- in short, would have been viewed as a<br>
most fortunate element in the nature of things. The raison d'etre of<br>
property is found in the very fact that there is no such possiblity,- in the<br>
fact that it is impossible in the nature of things for concrete objects to<br>
be used in different places at the same time. This fact existing, no person<br>
can remove from another's possession and take to his use another's concrete<br>
creation without thereby depriving that other of all opportunity to use that<br>
which he created, and for this reason it became socially necessary, since<br>
successful society rests on individual initiative, to protect the individual<br>
creator in the use of his concrete creations by forbidding others to use<br>
them without his consent. In other words, it became necessary to institute<br>
property in concrete things.    <br>
<p>
But all this happened so long ago that we of today have entirely forgotten<br>
why it happened. In fact, it is very doubtful whether, at the time of the<br>
institution of property, those who effected it thoroughly realized and<br>
understood the motive of their course. Men sometimes do by instinct and<br>
without analysis that which conforms to right reason. The institutors of<br>
property may have been governed by circumstances inhering in the nature of<br>
things, without realizing that, had the nature of things been the opposite,<br>
they would not have instituted property. But, be that as it may, even<br>
supposing that they thoroughly understood their course, we, at any rate,<br>
have pretty nearly forgotten their understanding. And so it has come about<br>
that we have made of property a fetish; that we consider it a sacred thing;<br>
that we have set up the god of property on an altar as an object of<br>
idol-worship; and that most of us are not only doing what we can to<br>
strengthen and perpetuate his reign within the proper and original limits of<br>
his sovereignty, but also are mistakenly endeavouring to extend his dominion<br>
over things and under circumstances which, in their pivotal characteristic,<br>
are precisely the opposite of those out of which his power developed.    <br>
<p>
All of which is to say, in briefer compass, that from the justice and social<br>
necessity of property in concrete things we have erroneously assumed the<br>
justice and social necessity of property in abstract things,- that is, of<br>
property in ideas,- with the result of nullifying to a large and lamentable<br>
extent that fortunate element in the nature of things, in this case not<br>
hypothetical, but real, - namely, the immeasurably fruitful possibility of<br>
the use of abstract things by any number of individuals in any number of<br>
places at precisely the same time, without in the slightest degree impairing<br>
the use thereof by any single individual. Thus we have hastily and stupidly<br>
jumped to the conclusion that property in concrete things logically implies<br>
property in abstract things, whereas, if we had had the care and the<br>
keenness to accurately analyze, we should have found that the very reason<br>
which dictates the advisability of property in abstract things denies the<br>
advisability of property in abstract things.  We see here a curious instance<br>
of that frequent mental phenomenon, - the precise inversion of the truth by<br>
a superficial view.    <br>
<p>
Furthermore, were the conditions the same in both cases, and concrete things<br>
capable of use by different persons in different places at the same time,<br>
even then, I say, the institution of property in concrete things, though<br>
under those conditions manifestly absurd, would be infinitely less<br>
destructive of individual opportunities, and therefore infinitely less<br>
dangerous and detrimental to human welfare, than is the institution of<br>
property in abstract things. For it is easy to see that, even should we<br>
accept the rather startling hypothesis that a single ear of corn is<br>
continually and permanently consumable, or rather inconsumable, by an<br>
indefinite number of persons scattered over the surface of the earth, still<br>
the legal institution of property in concrete things that would secure to<br>
the sower of a grain of corn the exclusive use of the resultant ear would<br>
not, in so doing, deprive other persons of the right to sow other grains of<br>
corn and become exclusive users of their respective harvests; whereas the<br>
legal institution of property in abstract things not only secures to the<br>
inventor, say, of the steam engine the exclusive use of the engines which he<br>
actually makes, but at the same time deprives all other persons of the right<br>
to make for themselves other engines envolving any of the same ideas.<br>
Perpetual property in ideas, then, which is the logical outcome of any<br>
theory of property in abstract things, would, had it been in force in the<br>
lifetime of James Watt, have made his direct heirs the owners of at least<br>
nine-tenths of the now existing wealth of the world; and had it been in<br>
force in the lifetime of the inventor of the Roman alphabet, nearly all the<br>
highly civilized peoples of the earth would be today the virtual slaves of<br>
that inventor's heirs, which is but another way of saying that, instead of<br>
becoming highly civilized, they would have remained in the state of<br>
semi-barbarism. It seems to me that these two statements, which in my view<br>
are incontrovertible, are in themselves sufficient to condemn property in<br>
ideas forever.<br>
