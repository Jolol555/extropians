<i>        &gt;Relativity remember, distances in both space and time are relative         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to the reference frame your in. From the perspective of a lightlike         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reference frame, they are all exactly zero.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
Obviously Einstein knew that from the reference frame of an observer moving <br>
at the speed of light the distance to any point in the universe is zero, <br>
and he knew that time grinds to a complete halt, and he knew that space-time  <br>
shrinks to a mathematical point; he is after all the very man who figured<br>
this out for the first time. Einstein also knew that we can not move at the <br>
speed of light, and he is also the first man to figure that out.<br>
 <br>
By "local" Einstein wanted a definition that could be of some use, he mente  <br>
there is no superluminal action at a distance, we now know from experimental  <br>
evidence that there IS superluminal action at a distance, even if we can't <br>
use it to communicate in a superluminal way. It is an experimental fact that <br>
Bell's inequality IS violated, and it would NOT be violated if the world <br>
was locally causal. Even if we someday find a better theory than Quantum <br>
Mechanics, any successful theory must  explain that experimental result. <br>
    <br>
If Cramer claims that his theory is local then he is also claiming that it <br>
is untrue, however I have never heard him say anything like that, instead he  <br>
talks about everyday events "shaking hands with the universe", and as I said  <br>
before, that's about as non-local as you can get.<br>

<i>        &gt;Again, this is a much deeper paradox in relativity than the twins         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;business, a paradox that QM patches up in a consistent manner.</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
One reason we know that we still have a lot to learn is that the 2 giant <br>
pillars of modern Physics, General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics have  <br>
little in common, until Hawking's work 30 years ago they had nothing in  <br>
common. We still have a long way to go before we have a Quantum Theory of <br>
gravity, and gravity is General Relativity's strong point.<br>
