I'm unsure if you directly quote Nozick, here.  I doubt you do (but<br>
admittedly I've not read his most recent work, and he has of late strayed<br>
from his once-libertarian views).  Sadly, I am far from my library, and have<br>
no copy of "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" at hand.  If memory serves, however,<br>
it provides ample quotes of Nozick discussing the absolutely vital role of<br>
intellectual debate in shaping human character.  Perhaps some interested and<br>
well-equiped philosopher will oblige us with Nozick's own words on the topic.<br>
<p>
I'd said: "Autism, in the sense of folding in on oneself, follows from<br>
contact<br>
with a violent world--not a non-coercive one."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Factually, autism does not follow from contact with a violent world.</i><br>
<i> &gt;[discussion of clinical aspects of autism follows.]</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I suspected as much; hence my reference to a special sense of the word<br>
(following your lead).  What I've studies of autism has left me thinking that<br>
nobody really knows what causes "autism" as clinical psychologists use the<br>
word.  Theories abound, of course; cures do not.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;The article goes on to discuss different manifestations of the social</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems that develop when the focus of attention is too narrow, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;working memory is inefficient.  This is exactly the problem with those</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals who adopt Nozick's radically "non-coercion" philosophy of: 'I</i><br>
<i>&gt;do not interfere with others.  Let them not interfere with me.'  </i><br>
<p>
Nozick's argument against *coercion* does not demand that one refuse to<br>
interact with fellow humans.  To the contrary, he advocates a world of<br>
thriving debate and rich socialization.  His "Framework for Utopia" section<br>
of ASU makes clear that he want a diverse and vibrant civil society.  I don't<br>
think anyone can reasonably claim that studying Nozick leads to a short<br>
attention span and an inefficient memory! <br>
