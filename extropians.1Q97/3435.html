Steve,<br>
<p>
Thanks for taking the time to track down the article on chimps I asked for. As you<br>
say, it is not exactly a Nature article, but I try to keep up on this debate so<br>
I wanted to see this evidence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Might I ask, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; are you so into this?  I thought Duesberg had a point too, until I started</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking into it.</i><br>
<p>
Since HIV didn't seem to me to be acing like a typical infectious disease, I <br>
carefully considered the arguments of Duesberg and others [his and some of their<br>
papers are nicely collected at www.duesberg.com] and found that their arguments<br>
were persuasive to me. And when I ran for governor of PA for the libertarian party in <br>
1994, I was asked to answer a whole slew of questionairres, one of which was from<br>
the League of Gay and Lesbian Voters. They had a few questions on AIDS, and so I<br>
felt the need to answer responsibly to their questions. Duesbergs recent book and<br>
the video I just got are very persuasive, IMHO. <br>
<p>
Thanks again.<br>
<p>
