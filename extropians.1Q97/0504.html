This brings up an interesting point:  How many different people use their<br>
own definitions for "extropy" and "transhuman"?  Over the years, I have<br>
noted a number of definitions other than the original definitions for both<br>
these terms, and some of them have been quite good. How these terms and<br>
their meanings pertain to us individually will certainly result in our *own*<br>
understanding of same.  For example, what "extropy" means to me, personally,<br>
will be different than to Joe, or Sue.  This is because we each have unique<br>
sets of references and levels of growth and development.  Same for<br>
"transhuman" - each of us being at our own particular level of being transhuman.<br>
<p>
Anyone can redefine a word whenever they like.  However, if we redefine it<br>
with a different meaning, it will cause confusion.  This is important to pay<br>
attention to.  Otherwise, is will appear that we are redefining words<br>
haphazardly.<br>
<p>
Why redefine terms that have already been published and are widely known?<br>
One reason is to improve the definition.  Another reason could be to cause<br>
confusion about the word.  There could be a number of reasons.  In the cases<br>
that I have noticed, as mentioned above, it was because of lack of knowledge<br>
about the term and its historical significance.<br>
<p>
Any number of extropians' or transhumans' defintions of these terms are, in<br>
part, a way to help them understand what they are trying to achieve by being<br>
extropian or transhuman.  A drawback is that it is not the original nor<br>
official definition.  By "official" I mean the definition by the creators of<br>
the term and the definition that is set to appear in the dictionary.<br>
<p>
extropy: noun, verb, adjective, a goal to achieve, a way of achieving a<br>
goal; a way of living life, a life to live; a infinite expanding system of<br>
living and non-living in the universe; a hairdo (can you imagine the new<br>
"look" being ... "and, she attended the coctail party in the height of<br>
fasion - the extropy hair and all ...")<br>
<p>
transhuman  n.  a human in transition getting from here to there -:)<br>
or<br>
transhuman  n.  a being who droped the "sub" and is obtaining a "post."<br>
