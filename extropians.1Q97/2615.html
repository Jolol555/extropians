<i>&gt; &gt;Not only /can/ "the good of the many" be ignored in a rational</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;system, it /must/ be.  It, like democracy, is a pretty idea that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;can only produce misery in the long run, by mechanisms well known</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and clearly evidenced over the ages.  There are only two ways for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;all human interaction to take place: by unanimous consent, or by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;force.  Any attempt to place value on "society" or "the many" or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;"the majority" or anything else but individual self-interest will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;inevitably require the use of force, and is doomed to failure.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; here's where i disagree, and like to point out that you yourself said you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't pursue your opwn self interest without others, so up to some point</i><br>
<i>&gt; the good of the many is inherent to the good of the individual (&amp; vice</i><br>
<i>&gt; versa!!!). There are situations where the good of the many limits the good</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the individual, but i believe there are also situations where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposite CAN be the case. Why is striving for a system where both</i><br>
<i>&gt; situations are minimalized so bad ?</i><br>
<p>
"The good of the many" is a rhetorical device much like "the selfish<br>
gene", but neither exist as real things.  One can speak of the /results/<br>
of evolution appearing /as if/ a gene were a volitional being, acting<br>
for its own propogation, but no one (except perhaps Moravec:) suggests<br>
that genes actually possess consciousness and volition.  Similarly, one<br>
can speak of an action that benefits many people /as if/ it benefits<br>
the group--but the reality is that a "group" has no mind to value things,<br>
or to experience benefit.  Values imply a valuer, a volitional being.<br>
Though I may use both of those rhetorical devices myself, I would no<br>
sooner attribute values or rights to a group than I would to a gene.<br>
It so happens that the /results/ of my selfish interest appear /as if/<br>
I am benefiting the group--but that's just your mind's pattern-matching<br>
machinery seeing something that isn't really there.<br>
