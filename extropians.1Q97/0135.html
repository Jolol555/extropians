<i>&gt; &gt; because the government, in the name of "stabilizing" (= slowing down)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the economy, raises interest rates that should be set by private bankers, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thus causing bonds to be more attractive than stocks.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The same thing would happen if rates were set by private bankers.  </i><br>
<p>
Why on Earth would private bankers deliberately slow down the economy? <br>
If capital is cheap, interest rates go down... it's called supply and<br>
demand.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; "The Incredible Bread Machine" is a fine reference on how the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; boom-and-bust cycle is intrinsic to government, not capitalism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When you're ready to read books for grown-ups, you will find that </i><br>
<i>&gt; business cycle theory is a large subject, in which simplistic answers </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't get you very far. You might want to read *Differential Equations, </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dynamical Systems, and Linear Algebra* by Hirsch and Smale, </i><br>
<i>&gt; to get an overview of instability and oscillations in dynamical systems.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another useful reference is *Perspectives of Nonlinear Dynamics* </i><br>
<i>&gt; by E. Atlee Jackson.</i><br>
<p>
Gosh.  And I suppose that as a mature, grown-up sort of person, you<br>
actually read "The Incredible Bread Machine" before claiming that I<br>
needed to study chaos theory?  The only time when the "simplistic<br>
answers" argument is valid is when somebody's found a scapegoat.  At all<br>
other times, simplistic answers are *more* valid than elaborate, complex<br>
answers.  It's called Occam's Razor - you'll learn about it in high<br>
school.  The only reason simplistic answers are suspect is because some<br>
of them are supplied by our emotional natures instead of reason.<br>
<p>
Admittedly this would appear the case here:  Blaming the government for<br>
everything wrong with the economy would, indeed, seem to be a clear case<br>
of finding a scapegoat.  (And I have no evidence that the authors of<br>
"Bread Machine" acted from reason rather than, ahem, other<br>
considerations.)<br>
<p>
Their basic argument, though, is highly plausible, and centers around<br>
the artificial clamping of interest rates.  If interest rates are low,<br>
this encourages long-term investments; if high, short-term investments. <br>
If the government holds interest rates at artificial lows during a<br>
depression, this encourages long-term investment when nobody will be<br>
saving up to buy it, thus prolonging the depression.  If the government<br>
holds interest rates at artificial highs during a boom "to reduce<br>
inflation" (as if giving money a high built-in growth factor would<br>
*reduce* inflation - this is just plain weird), fewer long-term<br>
investments will be made, resulting in an eventual bust when the economy<br>
runs out of resources.<br>
<p>
Interest rates act as a signpost for investment; if low, capital is<br>
cheap, people are saving up, and one should invest in long-term,<br>
expensive goods.  If high, capital is scarce, people are living in debt,<br>
and expensive goods will have no market.  If the government screws this<br>
signpost completely around, this will destabilize the market.<br>
<p>
They also point out that the inflation-vs.-unemployment curve is a<br>
simple fallacy; the *only* thing that causes inflation is the government<br>
printing money.  The boom-and-bust cycle is the inflationary curve; the<br>
benefits of inflation always ride a few moments ahead of the price,<br>
which can always be temporarily held off by even more inflation.<br>
<p>
As for the calculus and chaos theory you invoke above - for I see no<br>
actual equations, leading me to believe that this is a more haughty<br>
version of the "scientists support aromatherapy" you see in<br>
advertisements - I've played around with the Game of Life.  One thing I<br>
have learned is that twiddling with the rules, even in an apparently<br>
inconsequential way, will result in complete chaos.  If you want to<br>
stabilize a complex dynamical system, the first rule is to get the<br>
government the heck *out* of it.<br>
<p>
Capitalism is an inherently stable, symmetrical, self-organizing<br>
system.  Nobody needs to build checks and balances into capitalism by<br>
coercive force; the checks and balances are there already.  The law of<br>
Supply and Demand (unless the government clamps prices) is the classic<br>
example.  Investments with the highest payoff/risk ratio will be<br>
invested in (unless Greenspan decides otherwise), maximizing total<br>
output, the amount of "stuff" available per capita, and our standard of<br>
living.<br>
<p>
Capitalism is the single greatest self-organizing principle humanity has<br>
ever, ever, discovered - from the "hedonistic neuron" theory of brain<br>
organization to the supply-and-demand Daisyworld of ecology, almost<br>
every time nature does something self-organizing, the individual units<br>
are trying to maximize some quantity.  Nobody with even the vaguest<br>
familiarity with trying to engineer self-organizing systems would dream<br>
of suggesting otherwise.<br>
<p>
If you have any actual "differential equations" - no.  Pseudosciences<br>
often spew out masses of statistics and fundamentally unnecessary<br>
"equations" to disguise themselves as science.  I most sincerely doubt<br>
that *economics* (rather than respectable sciences such as engineering<br>
or chaos theory) has advanced to the point where differential equations<br>
are more than ballast or fancy ways of saying "A causes B".  Right now<br>
economists still can't agree on what factors to measure or models to<br>
use.  If you have any even vaguely realistic (i.e., not "simplistic" or<br>
ad hoc) models to support the random use of coercive force as a<br>
"stabilizing factor", let's see them.<br>
