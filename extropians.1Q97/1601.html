&lt;&lt; <br>
 You have seen the Newtonian side of my personality come out a few <br>
 times.  You're right, I can be abusive.  You don't know the half of it...  <br>
 Can you imagine a woman with a Newtonian personality?  She might <br>
 be beautiful, in a way, but she would be Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS.  <br>
 She might have power, but not the same power Jennifer had.  <br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
you think MATH makes you mean?<br>
Or even  math was what made Newton mean?<br>
Follow that thread, and you end up here: he was also Christian, and wrote<br>
endless reams of nonsense,  would THAT have happened to her too?<br>
