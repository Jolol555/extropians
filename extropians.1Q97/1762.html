Chris,<br>

<i>&gt; groups near other specific groups to keep things inert and peaceful. You</i><br>

<p>
It is an interesting problem, but I don't see why any readily available <br>
energy would not be extracted from the materials on their way in.  Almost <br>
all substances can be reformulated into highly inert forms.  It won't <br>
solve the organizational problems you mention, but not having to worry <br>
about reactivity would probably simplify the task quite a bit.<br>
