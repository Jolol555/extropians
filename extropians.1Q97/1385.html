It's not so much the e-mail program itself as what is used to write or<br>
view text.  Most of the original Internet, going through Unix or VMS,<br>
works on text with only ASCII controls (tab and carriage return, and<br>
even those are mutable) and is displayed as is, with tab expansion only.<br>
The one standard is that almost everyone was using 80 column screens.<br>
So we want text with line breaks already in it, preferably less than<br>
every 80 cols.  I'd guess that native Windows and Mac mail programs <br>
stream text when viewed, so you can just type text without hitting enter<br>
-- in fact, you won't want line breaks, because those break the<br>
automatic formatting.<br>
<p>
I suppose the ideal solution would be for the Unix world to use smarter<br>
viewers, or to have more MIME codes indicating whether text should be<br>
expected to be pre-broken or not.  But this won't happen quickly, and in<br>
the meantime ironically the more technical people are more likely to be<br>
using the 'primitive' Unix facilities.<br>
