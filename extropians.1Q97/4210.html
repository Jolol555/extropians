What if I personally build a model of some simple portion of the<br>

When the simulated cockroach walks it goes to a different location<br>
in its world (and also on the screen). You can measure the distance<br>
it travelled. You can add a wall to its environment that it cannot<br>
walk through so it has to walk around it. Would you claim it is moving<br>
without walking or that it is not moving?<br>

<i>&gt;What you are asking for is suspended disbelief. You want me to entertain</i><br>

<i>&gt;artificial life, for artificial life is just that, artificial. It is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;real. To date it has been nothing more than a model, and a poor model at</i><br>
<i>&gt;that of life. This is not to say it will remain this way. </i><br>
<p>
Many artificial things are real. Ask someone with an artificial heart<br>
whether they are really alive or if its just an illusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;  but that is like saying computers don't do math until the results</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are printed on paper.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No it is not. Math is an abstract concept. It can take place in abstract</i><br>
<i>&gt;space. Math does not require legs as walking does, math does not require</i><br>
<i>&gt;sensations as emotions do, math does require hardware though. Math</i><br>

<p>
OK, let's say in order to walk something must move by use of its legs.<br>
The simulated cockroach does this. If it doesn't move it legs in the<br>
right order and it the right way, it doesn't move, therefore it walks.<br>
I mentioned that the same program downloaded into a real six-legged <br>
robot allows the robot to walk in the real world to prove that the<br>
simulation was sufficiently realistic to model the real world.<br>
