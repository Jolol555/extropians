You are very right on this.  I was implicitly assuming that predictable<br>
meant 100% predictable.  Lesser amounts (&gt;0) would simply mean that we<br>
have managed to draw some kind of border around some unknown.<br>
<p>
As predictions go, they only tell us where free will is not, something <br>
I feel is essential not for finding out if we have free will, but for<br>
better approaching the problem of effective self-transformation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I admit I am aesthetically attracted to a well-turned phrase such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'dependence on transcendence,' perhaps this influences my rationality, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; I must say I find the argument to be logical that "independence does not</i><br>

<p>
I wouldn't worry about your rationality.  Intelligent mysticism is an<br>
extremely valuable tool for knowing the limits to rationality itself;<br>
although looking at its sordid history, it also seems to be as dangerous<br>
as a chain-saw.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Overemphasis on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the subjectivity of the humanistic world leads to the irresponsible</i><br>
<i>&gt; role-playing outlined in the first paragraph (and that I see so much of in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world today), but overemphasis on the objectivity of the scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; world leads to loss of free will through either iron determinism or</i><br>
<i>&gt; nihilistic randomness, a servility and docility with practical consequences</i><br>
<i>&gt; for extropic ascension as bad as the irresponsible role-playing. </i><br>
<p>
I find this an astute summary as to much of what is wrong with our society<br>
today.  I hope it's something we can all get over soon. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sounds like we need another "Warding Off Dogmatization" panel discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as we had at Extro-1.</i><br>
<p>
I have some interesting ideas along this line.  I think that David Musick's<br>
approach to conducting conversations with devout Christians uses a very<br>
powerful technique of communication which I don't think has been consciously<br>
recognized by our culture yet.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;      We need to pull ourselves out of the conceptual</i><br>
<i>&gt; doldrums we find ourselves in, regain the trade winds, and spend time and</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy achieving extropic purposes, instead of drifting along day-to-day in</i><br>
<i>&gt; an animal existence.  What's new, huh?</i><br>
<p>
We may yet find ourselves in a conceptual hurricane!<br>
