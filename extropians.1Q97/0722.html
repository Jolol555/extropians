<i>&gt; Jeez, everyone's irrational sometimes. Besides being practical, </i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable 'deference to your audience' is POLITE.</i><br>
<p>
If "politeness" dilutes the message, then to hell with it.  If<br>
you can be polite /and/ get your message across, so much the better.<br>
But the message comes first.<br>
<p>
Here's a practical example of what I mean: someone recently<br>
approached me selling candy bars to support a Boy Scout troop.  A<br>
polite "no thank you" would probably have been sufficient to spare<br>
his feelings and my $1, but it would not have educated either of<br>
us about our respective values.  In fact, since his question was<br>
"Would you like to buy a candy bar for $1", that simple reply would<br>
have been a lie, because I would indeed have liked to buy it if it<br>
benefitted, say, a private school.  I said "I'm sorry, but I don't<br>
believe in funding an organization that would not allow me to join."<br>
That might make him uncomfortable, but he gains a direct experience<br>
of his choice to support such a discriminatory organization, and I<br>
had the opportunity to hear his thoughts on the subject if he chose<br>
to respond (in this case he didn't--he simply said "OK" and went on).<br>
