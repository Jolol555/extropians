  Apologies, I've lost track of who said what first...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Lucy would have been a very poor hunter. She had no tools...</i><br>
<p>
  Without more luck than we seem to have had, only stone tools are<br>
likely to have survived in the archaeological record from Lucy's time.<br>
Yet interesting non-stone tool sets have been observed in many animals<br>
with smaller brains, and lower ratios of brain mass to body mass, than<br>
hers, so it is perhaps a little risky to rule out all tool use by<br>
_Australopithecus_afarensis_.<br>
<p>
    Use of found or fabricated woody tools for various purposes is<br>
widely reported in apes, in old-world monkeys, and in new-world monkeys<br>
(Fossey; Fragaszy and Adams-Curtis; Goodall; Westergard; Westergard and<br>
Fragaszy; and Beck, who in turn cites many authors). Nest-building is<br>
well-documented in such primates as _Pan_troglodytes_ and<br>
_Gorilla_gorilla_ (Goodall; Schaller, p. 213; Fossey, p. 47<br>
etc.). _Pan_troglodytes_ and _Pongo_pongo_ both create simple rain<br>
shields from leaves and twigs (Beck cites diverse sources on p. 104, and<br>
on p. 75 cites MacKinnon (1971, 1974), Galdikas (1975, 1978) and<br>
Rijksen). _Pan_troglodytes_ beats noisily on things as part of display<br>
(Goodall, p. 112). _Pongo_pongo_ has been observed to use ad-hoc rafts<br>
(following observation of human use of boats), and even to paddle (Beck,<br>
p. 132, citing then-unpublished work by Galdikas). Should we not expect<br>
artifacts and artifact use at least this complex from the generally<br>
better-encephalized and closely related hominid line?  (I am reluctant<br>
to use the word "encephalized", for it suggests phrenology with a PhD:<br>
It may only obscure great ignorance of how brain structure relates to<br>
cognition.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;                                                         ...she was</i><br>
<i>&gt; slow, she did not have sharp teeth and her claws were a joke.    </i><br>
<p>
    It is thought-provoking to realize that hominids are probably the<br>
wimpiest mammals of their size in the entire Pleistocene.  How did our<br>
ancestors keep from becoming a popular and soon-extinct fast-food<br>
selection?  Behavior is a likely explanation, and even such simple<br>
ad-hoc tool use as throwing rocks might have made a difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Erectus was originally dated to less than 1.5 mill years. Now hes as</i><br>
<i>&gt; far back as 4-5 million. Sapiens was once thought to go back only</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20,000-40,000 years, yet it is now thought to date as far back as 100k</i><br>
<i>&gt; to 150k, maybe even more.</i><br>
<p>
    I haven't heard of an _Erectus_ date earlier than about 2 million<br>
years ago (mya).  Do you have a reference?<br>
<p>
    There is a problem here with how people use words.  The essence of<br>
"species" as used by most biologists is reproductive isolation -- the<br>
boundary of a "species" is the limit to which genes can mix by mating<br>
(with plenty of caveats).  Lacking a time machine, one cannot always<br>
decide whether two populations of creatures that lived at different<br>
times are one species, or two.  People like to use the word "lineage"<br>
instead.  To understand what it means, imagine that you had a complete<br>
and correct phylogenetic family tree showing the evolution of the<br>
populations of creatures in which you were interested.  (Usually you<br>
don't have any such thing.)  Slice the tree horizontally, and the number<br>
of distinct cut surfaces you produce is the number of extant species at<br>
that time -- that is, the number of extant species is the number of<br>
distinct branches of the tree that pass upward through the given time.<br>
(More caveats about what happens if a cut intercepts a speciation<br>
process.)  A "lineage" is a maximal interval on a specific branch,<br>
between nodes -- a segment of the evolution of a population within which<br>
no speciation events took place.  That's not the same as saying that no<br>
evolution took place, of course<br>
    Thus, if you happen to believe that no speciation event took place<br>
in the lineage leading to _Homo_sapiens_ in the last two million years<br>
(a controversial subject), you would say that we and the creature<br>
commonly known as _Homo_erectus_ are on the same lineage, and you would<br>
probably use the first-published of the two species names --<br>
_Homo_sapiens_ -- to label that lineage.  In that view, one could say<br>
that the lineage of _Homo_sapiens_ was extant two million years ago.<br>
Yet even if so, no one doubts that there are substantial physiological<br>
differences between the members of that lineage who lived then, and<br>
those who live now.<br>
