&lt; Stone tools dating back 2.5 million years are the oldest ever found, <br>
scientists reported  Wednesday, prompting a search for more evidence <br>
about the pre-humans who made them. The surprisingly sophisticated <br>
tools, found on the border between Ethiopia and Kenya, push back<br>
the frontier of the first-known use of tools by pre-humans by 200,000 <br>
years.&gt;<br>
