I read about half of his book, and found his philosophy as<br>
unimpressive as his market knowledge was sophisticated.<br>
Not an unusual thing - when somebody makes a career in one<br>
field, and then teaches people in others.<br>
Still, I had an impression that his philosophy was sincere;<br>
he really tries to improve things.  Which doesn't necessarily<br>
mean that he should be supported, as his views on what is good<br>
for the world may be mixed with the desire to keep himself in<br>
control of the developments, and this is exactly the combination<br>
that created the worst villains in history out of people who<br>
viewed themselves as do-gooders.<br>
  I doubt that Soros would surrender the control of his funds<br>
to a group of people who may understand global social matters<br>
better.<br>
 I don't know that much about him though.<br>
<p>
 Recently, I read an excellent review of Soros's ideas and<br>
activities, and problems of his organization in Telepolis -<br>
