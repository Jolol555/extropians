Let's make a fresh start.  Forget the SAT.  Using the word "genius" to <br>
refer to someone who does well on standardized tests is a bureaucratic <br>
debasement of language.   <br>
<p>
The word "genius" is used in many senses.  The American Heritage <br>
Dictionary gives the following as its main definition:  "Exceptional or <br>
transcendent intellectual and creative power."  Let's stick with that <br>
definition for the purposes of this discussion.  How do we know who <br>
has such power?  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  The only <br>
test that means anything is lifetime achievement.  <br>
<p>
Transcendent:  In other words, there are not millions of geniuses.  <br>
There are only a few.  Beethoven, Bach, maybe a dozen others in <br>
music.  A similar number in other fields.  We are talking about the  <br>
very summit of human achievement.  <br>
<p>
The question is:  who reaches that summit?  <br>
<p>
In this post I'm just going to focus on one field, mathematics.  There <br>
were a few great architects who created mathematics:  Archimedes, <br>
Euclid, Fermat, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Euler, Lagrange, Gauss, <br>
Cauchy, Galois, Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, Poincare.  That's the <br>
whole list.  They are the ones who reached the summit.  They were all <br>
men.  <br>
<p>
I could extend this list to include other men who made contributions to <br>
the structure of mathematics, less fundamental and far-reaching than <br>
the work of the 15 listed above.  There are approximately a hundred <br>
names on this list:  Pythagoras, Eudoxus, Apollonius, Diophantus, <br>
Al-Khowarizmi, Levi ben Gershon, Nicolas Oresme, Tartaglia, <br>
Cardano, Viete, Desargues, Blaise Pascal, Napier, John Wallis, Isaac <br>
Barrow, James Gregory, de Moivre, Christiaan Huygens, N. Mercator, <br>
James Bournouli, John Bournouli, Taylor, D'Alembert, Joseph Fourier, <br>
Vandermonde, Legendre, Pierre de Laplace, Eisenstein, Moebus, <br>
Pluecker, Dirichlet, Nikolai Lobachevsky, Janos Bolyai, Beltrami, <br>
Jacobi, Hermite, Poisson, Hamilton, Cayley, Liouville, Dedekind, <br>
Kronecker, Felix Klein, W. Dyck, Camille Jordan, Georg Cantor, <br>
Sophus Lie, Borel, Henri Lebesgue, Elie Cartan, Maurice Frechet, <br>
David Hilbert, Felix Hausdorff, Ramanujan, Georges de Rham, <br>
Banach, G. D. Birkhoff, John von Neumann, Kurt Goedel, Hermann <br>
Weyl, Andre Weil, Jean Dieudonne, Rene Thom, Liapunov, Pontrygin, <br>
L. J. Mordell, Paul Cohen, ...   <br>
<p>
That's as far as I can get tonight.  It's hard to decide which 20th <br>
century mathematicians to include.  The point is that there are only a <br>
few mathematicians who have made fundamental contributions to the <br>
subject, and they are all men.  There are NO women, ZERO, whose <br>
mathematical work comes anywhere near qualifying for this list.  <br>
<p>
Now, I could extend the list again, to include several hundred names of <br>
individuals who have made seminal contributions at a less general <br>
level.  Note that I said "individuals" this time, instead of men.  At this <br>
level, there would be two women on the list:  Sonja Kovalevsky and <br>
Emmy Noether.  Two.  In the entire history of mathematics, those are <br>
the only two women whose contributions are memorable at all, and <br>
they are relatively minor.  Two, out of hundreds.  <br>
<p>
Being a mathematician is not always easy.  Let's look at one example.  <br>
Quoting from *Mathematics and its History* by Stillwell, <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Niels Henrik Abel was born in the small town of Finnoy, on the </i><br>
southwestern coast of Norway, in 1802 and died in Oslo in 1829... <br>
His father drank himself to death in 1820, leaving the family penniless.  <br>
Niels Henrik, now the oldest responsible member of the family, took <br>
steps which were to save his sister Elisabeth and younger brother <br>
Peder.  He found another home for Elisabeth and took Peder with him <br>
when he entered the University of Oslo in 1821.  <br>
<i>&gt; Before long, Abel had read most of the advanced mathematical </i><br>
works in the university library, and his own research began in earnest.  <br>
By 1823 he had discovered the inversion that was the key to elliptic <br>
functions, proved the unsolvability of the quintic, and discovered a <br>
wonderful general theorem on integration, now known as Abel's <br>
theorem, which implicitly introduces the concept of genus...<br>
<i>&gt; By the end of 1826 Abel was running out of money and eating only </i><br>
one meal a day.  He feared he was losing touch with Crelly [his fiance], <br>
as she had returned to Copenhagen and her letters were infrequent.  <br>
He left Paris for Berlin on December 29, while he still had money to <br>
pay for the journey, and found a letter from Crelly waiting.  Some good <br>
news at last!  Crelly stood by him as ever, and their plans for the future <br>
were revived.  ... Unfortunately, the university was still unwilling to <br>
give him more than a temporary appointment, which paid barely <br>
enough to meet his family's debts.  ... <br>
<i>&gt; In May 1828 Abel finally received a decent job offer from Berlin, </i><br>
only to have it withdrawn two months later...  Then a group of French <br>
mathematicians petitioned the king of Norway - Sweden to use his <br>
influence on Abel's behalf, but still the University of Oslo remained <br>
unmoved.  By now, time was running out.  Abel's health worsened  <br>
and in January 1829 he began spitting blood.  ...  Abel died on April 6, <br>
1829, just two days before the arrival of a letter informing him of his <br>
appointment as professor in Berlin.  <br>
<p>
Thus he died in his 27th year.  Hermite said  "Abel left mathematicians <br>
with enough to keep them busy for 500 years."  That's genius.  <br>
<p>
They say women are discouraged from studying mathematics.  Well, <br>
I'm sorry.  No doubt, the poor dears are discouraged.  When I see them <br>
eating one meal a day and spitting blood, then I'll know they are <br>
serious.  <br>
