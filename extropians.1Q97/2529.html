In the process of redesigning my Web site to include a number of<br>
small essays, I wanted to create some method for comments and<br>
rebuttals to be included.  I have designed a rebuttal-bot system<br>
for this purpose which I will describe here.  I solicit comments<br>
and suggestions for improvement.<br>
<p>
Current design:<br>
  - Each essay has a button-bar at the top leading to commentary<br>
    pages.  Positive and negative comments are separate (I don't<br>
    want to dilute the entertaining rebuttals with me toos).<br>
  - On each commentary page, there is a form by which the<br>
    reader can enter his own comments.<br>
  - All comments, without exception or edition, are displayed on<br>
    the comment page for a certain amount of time, after which<br>
    they rotate out (only if they become numerous enough to<br>
    require it).<br>
  - Interesting rebuttals that I think deserve more thorough<br>
    treatment are moved to a permanent discussion page.  I will<br>
    inform the submitter that I have done so, add my counter-<br>
    argument, and solicit a counter-rebuttal.  The rebutter<br>
    always gets the last word.<br>
  - The comment pages will also contain links to other pages<br>
    with similar ideas (both pro and con), and readers will be<br>
    able to suggest links as well.  Commentaries themselves can<br>
    contain URLs.<br>
  - Every piece of text (mine and comments) is headed by date and<br>
    author (unless submittor wants to be anonymous, which will be<br>
    honored).<br>
