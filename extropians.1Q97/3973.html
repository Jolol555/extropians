When we're discussing the nature of political possibility, I think the<br>
population economists would think of is not the dozens or hundreds of<br>
highly educated or popular people, but the millions and billions of<br>
people who have had their little inputs into society.  When, for<br>
example, you advocate anarchist solutions, you are saying that all<br>
societies, for all of human history, have been making the same mistake<br>
of having government.  That's a very strong claim.  Can you pit your<br>
logic and experience against the thought and experience of billions of<br>
people?<br>
<p>
And once you have, can you convince those people that you're not nuts to<br>
begin with?<br>

Holy Wood!...was that special sort of beautiful area which is only<br>
beautiful if you can leave after briefly admiring its beauty and go<br>
somewhere else where there are hot tubs and cold drinks.  Actually<br>
staying there for any length of time is a penance. -- _Moving Pictures_<br>
