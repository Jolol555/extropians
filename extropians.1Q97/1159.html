<i>&gt;So in that sense, it is clear that "emotions"--which we will</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to identify ostensively for now lacking more precise</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition--"have a role to play" in cognition, to the extent</i><br>
<i>&gt;that they affect it.  I am also well aware that the esthetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;value of ideas can guide one into which areas to research.</i><br>
<p>
And of course "reason" can only be identified in the same manner:<br>
ostensively. When the nature of reason is pinned down precisely (as<br>
Bartley has done to some degree), its fundamentally communicative,<br>
social, and critical nature becomes apparent. Reason is founded in the<br>
very processes of communication that your attitudes undermine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All I am trying to say is that there must be a final arbiter</i><br>
<i>&gt;of what to call "knowledge", and that however emotion may have</i><br>
<i>&gt;helped or hindered the process of getting there, somebody has</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be the last guard at the gate.</i><br>
<p>
This is exactly wrong. First of all, you're duplicating the arguments<br>
of the old Continental Rationalists, against whom the British<br>
empiricists argued that the senses are the final arbiter of what<br>
to call knowledge. Frankly, I'm more sympathetic to the empiricists<br>
on this issue than to the rationalists, but I think they're both<br>
wrong. There is no single final arbiter. Knowledge is produced by<br>
the cooperation of a broad variety of distinct cognitive and sensory<br>
skills, and the subset of these skills which may fall under your<br>
rubric of "reason" is only one of the players in the knowledge<br>
production process.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Right now, I have given</i><br>
<i>&gt;those keys to a guy called "reason", because he has served me</i><br>
<i>&gt;well.  The vast torrent of concepts and percepts may compete</i><br>
<i>&gt;among themselves by any means available, but whatever winners</i><br>
<i>&gt;come to the gate of knowledge, only one test lets them in.</i><br>
<p>
Now you're recycling the tired old dualistic homunculus theory of<br>
consciousness, except as a theory of epistemology rather than of<br>
consciousness. If I hadn't already dragged out the word "idol" I<br>
would do so at this point.  This is not "reason", this is superstition!<br>
Reason is a vast and glorious school, a tradition, a broad social<br>
phenomenon, not some robot in your head.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I cannot disagree, but until that understanding comes, I'm stuck</i><br>
<i>&gt;with what I have.  If someone finds a more precise definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge or better methods judging reality, his burden is simple:</i><br>
<i>&gt;show me.</i><br>
<p>
What I have to show is all inside your head. I can't make you look<br>
at it. If you want to go through life as a cognitive cripple with<br>
half your brain chopped out because you will only listen to the<br>
part of your brain that you have packaged up and labeled "reason",<br>
that's not my loss. You have a whole brain, and you know very well<br>
that there are large chunks of it which do not correspond to what<br>
you call "reason" but which have had survival value for your<br>
ancestors (or they wouldn't be there). I would not be so cavalier<br>
about ignoring them as you seem to be.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Science never produces false knowledge, because it never produces /any/</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge.  Scientists are generally skeptics, afraid to commit to</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything.  Scientists say things like "Our current best understanding,</i><br>
<i>&gt;based on these data, is..."  What I have called "knowledge" in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;foregoing discussion is what a scientist calls "data", but not quite.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The conclusions drawn from that are useful, justifiable, guesses that</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be used to accomplish things, but I'm not sure I would elevate</i><br>
<i>&gt;them quite to the level of "knowledge".  Perhaps we need more words</i><br>
<i>&gt;for these fine distinctions.</i><br>
<p>
Well, now you're really at sea. Data are produced by the senses,<br>
not by reason... otherwise Aristotle's theory of what we now call<br>
gravitation would be true today. We don't need more words for these<br>
fine distinctions, we need more empirical neuropsychology research.<br>
<p>
And as for your claim that science does not produce knowledge, that<br>
is a rhetorical flourish that showed up for the wrong argument.<br>
I am not representing the logical positivist position here.  If we<br>
aren't discussing scientific knowledge, what precisely are we<br>
discussing? Theological knowledge? Your knowledge of your underwear<br>
size? Bill Clinton's knowledge of economics?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Like I said, when you find something better, show me.  I do not deny</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it might exist, I only state what I have seen to be the best so far,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and since 90% of the population hasn't even accepted that yet, and there</i><br>
<i>&gt;is still much to be accomplished with it, I find it more profitable to</i><br>
<i>&gt;invest my time in reason as I know it than in speculation about something</i><br>
<i>&gt;better, until I find some limitation of it to inspire the search.</i><br>
<p>
Okay, so now you've backed down to the classic relativist position:<br>
"it works for me". In that case, why are you going around verbally<br>
attacking people for using more than *just* their reason? It works<br>
for them, right? This much should be obvious.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If an honest expression causes someone to "close off" his mind, then</i><br>
<i>&gt;that fact in itself is dangerous and needs to be dealt with.  </i><br>
<p>
This is sheer sanctimony, Lee. Perhaps you might better tend to<br>
"dealing with" your own mind, rather than "dealing with" the minds of<br>
others. Dangerous? What is dangerous about someone choosing not to<br>
listen to a boorish, rude, sanctimonious, disrespectful lout? I'm<br>
sorry, but I can't see any danger in this. Actually, I think this is<br>
quite healthy, especially if the lout in question is working for the<br>
government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I suspect</i><br>
<i>&gt;the opposite: I suspect that a shocking fact or opinion actually draws</i><br>
<i>&gt;attention to itself and increases the chance of the listener really</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinking about it.  Maybe I'll call it the Geraldo effect :)</i><br>
<p>
My chiefest charge was that your insulting mode of giving orders to<br>
other people about how to organize the contents of their own minds is not<br>
going to change any minds. Your manner of speaking is self-defeating and<br>
self-stultifying: it prevents the communication of the information you<br>
are trying to communicate, and no amount of wishful daydreaming on your<br>
part about how people ought to work harder to emulate Spock is going to<br>
make your style of argumentation any more effective. I'm personally<br>
annoyed with this (and you're getting the brunt of it, because you've<br>
obviously been spoiling for a fight with someone) because whenever I let<br>
people know that I'm a libertarian, I usually have to deal with the<br>
reaction "Oh, you mean you're one of those sanctimonious know-it-all<br>
aggressively rude Randroids?" And it is people who have been using the<br>
style of argumentation that you recommend which create this reaction for<br>
me. And people using the style of argumentation that you recommend have<br>
done far more harm than good for the political causes that you and I<br>
both support. Hence my anger.<br>
<p>
If you ever want to change your ways and start actually producing the<br>
changes you want to see in the world instead of shooting yourself in the<br>
foot and arming the world against you, the Advocates for Self-Government<br>
have some pamphlets you might want to look at.<br>
