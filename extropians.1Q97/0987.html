I wonder if intelligence or brain power is the important point here. <br>
<p>
Together with my computer, I can communicate with experts across the<br>
world, solve mathematical problems quickly and reliably, gather and<br>
process information much faster than in a library and remember my results <br>
for years perfectly. Obviously, my productivity (my effective <br>
intelligence) has been increased. <br>
<p>
But what am I really doing? I'm letting various more or less autonomous <br>
subsystems do work for me, sometimes quite complex work, while I don't <br>
even need to understand how it is done. This is very similar to how we <br>
acquire skill: at first we need to understand and concentrate on what we <br>
are doing, but later it becomes natural and unconscious. Typing on a <br>
keyboard is a very complex process, but since I know it well it appears <br>
to me as an unitary process with no internal complexity, I just do it.<br>
<p>
The modern environment is filled with this proceduralization: we have <br>
simplified it to a large extent by hiding away the complexity inside <br>
black boxes, which greatly improves our efficiency without relying on <br>
increased intelligence (in fact, many technologies seem to decrease it!). <br>
So greater *personal* intelligence might not be the crucial thing in the <br>
future, but greater *effective* intelligence. <br>
