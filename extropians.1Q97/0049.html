<i>&gt; The first sign of what's coming is the stock market.  It continues to </i><br>
<i>&gt; forge ahead.  This is the great Victory-of-Capitalism Bull Market.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; As the market penetrates into all corners of the earth, the economy </i><br>
<i>&gt; becomes more stable.  There will be no more recessions.  That part of </i><br>
<i>&gt; history is over.  There will be no more bear markets, at least not </i><br>
<i>&gt; for the market as a whole.  Individual stocks, and individual countries, </i><br>
<i>&gt; will go up and down.  But the aggregate will grow steadily, and in fact </i><br>
<i>&gt; the stock market will grow at increasing rates.  In recent years it has </i><br>
<i>&gt; been in the 20 - 30% range.  It will move into the 50 - 60% range in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; next couple of years, and then into the 100 - 200% range.  And on up </i><br>
<i>&gt; from there.  </i><br>
<p>
The stock market will never be stable until the government gets the heck<br>
out of it.  "Stock market drops 200 points on news of strong economy." <br>
What?  Shouldn't stock prices *rise* if companies are doing better?  No,<br>
because the government, in the name of "stabilizing" (= slowing down)<br>
the economy, raises interest rates that should be set by private<br>
bankers, thus causing bonds to be more attractive than stocks.  Or maybe<br>
they just shoot anyone who buys above a certain price.  I don't care. <br>
This is ridiculous.<br>
<p>
"The Incredible Bread Machine" is a fine reference on how the entire<br>
boom-and-bust cycle is intrinsic to government, not capitalism.<br>
