I think the situation is not entirely clear-cut. We certainly have<br>
hardwired emotional systems, and some of them are very simple (note that <br>
we may have preconditioned fear responses to certain animals or things; <br>
most fobias are directed against insects or snakes, not cars or mousepads). <br>
<p>
Essentially emotions seems to be based on level of arousal (purely<br>
physiological), and a quality which determines what kind of emotion it is<br>
(hate and love might be high-arousal emotions, but differ in quality).<br>
Most likely the basic qualities are hard-wired (I don't know if there are<br>
any humans with unique emotions, there are no evidence for them). This<br>
quality can in turn be interpreted by the rest of the mind in a variety of<br>
ways, creating a bewildering array of emotions: they can be mixed into<br>
ambivalent states, they can be reappraised, various mental tricks are<br>
regularly used by us to turn one emotion into another and emotions are<br>
analysed cognitively. It is at this level where individual variation and<br>
personality becomes truly important, and I think it can be reprogrammed<br>
quite a bit. <br>
