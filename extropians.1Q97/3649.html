OK, this makes sense.<br>
<p>
Is a relatively (pardon the pun) nearby, but beyond the lethal radius (say<br>
2000 light-years) neutron star binary collapse a plausible cause for mass<br>
extinctions?  <br>
<p>
I would think that if such events are truly as common as this, the prognosis<br>
for long-term space colonization is poor.  It would be very hard for a<br>
space-based civilization to sustain hundreds of years of hard radiation at<br>
such intensity that an atmosphere is insufficient shield.  Even planetary<br>
based nanotech using civilizations would be very strained by such events.<br>
