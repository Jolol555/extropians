An interesting observation.  David Friedman also finds sports<br>
spectatorship the best analogy with voting motivations.  The fun is to<br>
take sides and make some team your "team".  I'm not sure why this<br>
behavior happens either, but these two theories of politics also seem<br>
plausible here:<br>

<i>&gt;We're in a signaling game where political knowledge is taken as a sign</i><br>

<i>&gt;political "beliefs" (really verbal banners).</i><br>
