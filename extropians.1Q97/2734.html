<i>&gt;Calm vs. excitement is not the same as caution vs. confidence.  Why</i><br>

<i>&gt;confidence help you win arguments?</i><br>
<p>
Now you are asking questions about the cognitive and performative<br>
functions of the amygdala and others parts of the brain.  In my<br>
experience, people do assume a much more confident tone in<br>
argumentation when they are excited about what they are arguing,<br>
and people who have a confident tone in argumentation tend to win<br>
over the less thoughtful spectators, some of whom vote. So there<br>
is an incentive structure here as well. It's not much of an incentive<br>
on its own, but given that people argue anyway because they enjoy<br>
it, this might be enough of an incentive to skew how they argue.<br>

<i>&gt;Ah, yes. Another answer to Robin's question is that our society is</i><br>
<i>&gt;permeated with the Dogma of Democracy, and the Dogma of Democracy</i><br>
<i>&gt;is that any randomly chosen citizen's opinion about a political</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue is exactly as valuable and likely to be "true" as anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;else's opinion of that issue. </i><br>

Robin replied:<br>
<i>&gt;This seems to just restate the puzzle, rather than explaining it.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but it makes it clearer that this is a historical puzzle. The<br>
current widespread belief in majority-rule dogmas *may* be explicable<br>
only as a result of accidents of history. Do current political<br>
economists acknowledge accidents of history? I would expect that<br>
as political economy matures, it would acknowledge the diachronic<br>
as well as the synchronic aspects of the field.<br>
<p>
When I try to approach questions like this one seriously, I don't<br>
try to answer them just by looking at current conditions (though<br>
I'm glad that there are some people working on the problem who *do*<br>
discipline their inquiries in that way). What I do is study history<br>
and try to figure out what happened to the development of the family<br>
of liberal political ideologies between the early nineteenth century<br>
and the mid twentieth century. It's a nasty can of worms. But the<br>
dogma of majority rule got entrenched in North America and Europe<br>
during the nineteenth century, for the most part, and then just<br>
kind of exploded and washed over the world after the end of World<br>
War II. Or at least that's how it looks from where I sit. (See,<br>
now I'm doing the same kind of "collectivist thinking" I was just<br>
chiding Reilly about... hmm.)<br>
<p>
By "majority rule", I mean specifically the idea that minorities<br>
in a society ought to submit to the will of majorities in a society,<br>
not the practice of using majority rule in voluntary organizations<br>
and small parliamentary bodies. And lest this be misconstrued, I<br>
should mention that I don't care for minority rule either. I think<br>
government, if it exists, should be very careful to preserve a<br>
distinction between the law and the will of the majority, and our<br>
current political system is doing a very poor job of preserving<br>
that distinction.<br>
<p>
Robin also replied to Ken Kittlitz:<br>
<i> &gt;People believe that cars and planes have a direct impact on their</i><br>
<i> &gt;lives, but view have much confidence in their opinions on what</i><br>
<i> &gt;makes these safe/efficient etc.</i><br>
<p>
I know I'm taking this out of context, but cars and planes are not<br>
agents, and people are not generally forced to ride in them and<br>
fly in them if they don't want to.<br>
