Mike, the best thing for you to do now, in your  current dependent position is <br>
to make yourself appear to have submitted to the will of the hands that feed <br>
you.  You may have to lose access to the Internet for a while, but that won't <br>
prevent your mind from growing and coming up with lots of transhuman and <br>
extropian ideas on your own.  You don't *need* the Internet *right now*.  <br>
There is much you can do on your own to improve your skills and knowledge, <br>
until you are skillful and knowledgable enough that you can support yourself <br>
through your own work.<br>
<p>
I say, be practical first.  Make sure you will have a place to live and food <br>
to eat *first*; that is your first priority.  To ensure proper food and <br>
shelter at this point for you requires a certain sacrifice of your freedom to <br>
do other things.  You've got to go with the system you're in until you can <br>
find a way to live in a different system.  The situation you are in right now <br>
requires certain sacrifices.  You will have to submit to these sacrifices <br>
until you work yourself into a situation that doesn't require those <br>
sacrifices.  You need to pretend to be submissive to those you depend on.  <br>
Gain their loving affections, and they will maintain the flow of resources to <br>
you.  Eventually you will gain your independence if you keep developing your <br>
knowledge and skills and using your creativity.  If you learn to excell at <br>
providing people with what they want, it is easier to convince them to give <br>
you what you want, to make a trade with them.<br>
<p>
Just keep improving yourself as much as you can, through whatever means don't <br>
threaten the security of your life.  Eventually you will be competent enough <br>
to establish your own independence.<br>
<p>
