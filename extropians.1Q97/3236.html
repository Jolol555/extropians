<i>&gt; I'm suspicious of this leap from correlation of social behavior to genetics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our genetic structure evolved over eons, and in the vast majority of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; time there was no such thing as 'money', 'wealth', or 'richness'.  Are</i><br>
<i>&gt; they saying that it is possible to encode such a concept as 'rich' in DNA? </i><br>
<p>
I have to disagree; yes, there always was "wealth" throughout all of<br>
human history, just as there is in aboriginal societies today.  It's<br>
likely to be measured in plots of land, cattle, wives, social status,<br>
or whatever else the particular society valued.  "Money" is just a<br>
convenient form of measurement for wealth that we have created in<br>
recent times to simplify the act of trade, but the concept itself is<br>
a much more fundamental one.<br>
<p>
And yes, anything that affects behavior can be "encoded in DNA".  The<br>
fact that the first step in the chain of gene-&gt;phenotype happens to be<br>
protein synthesis is no reason to discount phenotypic effects that we<br>
cannot necessarily trace back that far.  /All/ phenotypes involve<br>
convoluted interwoven reactions among coded proteins, the embryonic<br>
environment, and the living environment.  To assume otherwise would<br>
be to argue conscious design.<br>
<p>
What we actually mean when we say "a gene for X" is that some gene at<br>
some particular locus in the genome, all else being equal, will be more<br>
likely than its alleles to result in trait X being expressed in the<br>
organism.  It implies no specific cause; it may increase the emotional<br>
response to some stimulus, thereby encouraging some behavior; it may<br>
make some morphological change that reduces the energy expended on some<br>
behavior; it might make some purely cosmetic change that affects the<br>
way other organisms behave when seeing you.<br>
<p>
The question, then, is how might a gene that had the effect of reducing<br>
a wealthy person's desire to breed might have become more numerous than<br>
its alleles in future generations.  At first, this seems impossible--<br>
typically, genes survive when people breed more, not less, and wealthy<br>
people are better able to care for more children.  But evolution has<br>
done stranger things.  Even a trait as drastic as sterility in worker<br>
ants can be shown to be an adaptation of the peculiar haplodiploid<br>
genome of eusocial insects.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the trait came about from periods of boom and bust in the<br>
climate.  Families with fewer children wound up fatter in boom times,<br>
and tended to survive the next drought better than large families of<br>
skinny kids.  If such droughts occured on the average once or twice<br>
per generation, such behavior might well have produced more grandkids<br>
for parents who fattened up one or two kids that those who wastefully<br>
bred more just to die out.  This is pure speculation, of course, but<br>
some such mechanism is quite plausible.  All that is required is that<br>
/some/ gene had /some/ effect that caused a difference in behavior,<br>
and that behavior caused a difference in reproduction.<br>
<p>
I would tend to suspect other social causes for the effect, but I<br>
wouldn't rule out genetic basis or predisposition.<br>
