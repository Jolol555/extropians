Maybe I was born mean.  Anyway I've found that it is possible <br>
to be mean and have fun too.  I wasn't kidding about Leslie.  But we <br>
don't need to go into that.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Follow that thread, and you end up here:  he was also Christian, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and wrote endless reams of nonsense, would THAT have happened </i><br>
<i>&gt; to her too?</i><br>
<p>
Who the hell are you to say that *anything* Newton wrote was <br>
nonsense?  You are talking about NEWTON, damn it.  Pay your dues <br>
first, before mentioning his name.  It amazes me, what Extropians say <br>
about Newton.  "Just think what he would have accomplished, if only <br>
he hadn't wasted his time on all that mystical stuff... "   As if the <br>
greatest of all scientists needed a bunch of pip-squeak atheists <br>
to tell him how to spend his time.  Christianity and alchemy gave him <br>
the dynamic ontology he needed to do what he did.  <br>

<i>&gt; Are you a mathemitician?  Are women complaining?  ;)  </i><br>
<p>
I gave up math years ago.  Mathematics is still part of what I do, <br>
but a minor part.  My alchemical tranformation is taking a different <br>
path now, and I am sexier than I used to be, more comfortable with <br>
women, and happier.  (Meanwhile, however, age has taken its toll.  <br>
45-minute erections are a thing of the past.  But there are other ways   <br>
to be sexy.)  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You seem to assume that we are incapable of multi-tasking.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; And that a woman can't be sexual and sensual and intelligent.  </i><br>
<p>
Jen was intelligent.  That's part of who she was.  If she had been just <br>
another dumb blonde, she wouldn't have been Jennifer.  She could have <br>
been *more* intelligent if she had pushed herself harder, but, as I <br>
keep insisting, there would have been a tradeoff.  You can't be both a <br>
Sumo wrestler and a ballet dancer.  You can't be both a bear and a <br>
hummingbird.  Maybe the New Extropian Woman, with her multi-<br>
tasking operating system, can chew gum and whistle at the same time, <br>
but I doubt it.  <br>
<p>
BTW, Joy, I read your web page and noticed that your husband is <br>
Tom Williams.  I wonder if this is the same Tom Williams I knew at the <br>
Free U in 1968 - 70.  As I recall he was into building home power <br>
systems to get off the grid.  Wouldn't surprise me to find him married <br>
to a goddess in the Santa Cruz mountains.   <br>
