Sounds great! I would like to participate in the species design (hmm, <br>
they will definitely have a "meaning of life"). The rosette design would <br>
need to involve some stabilization systems, to keep it in shape (it is so <br>
embarassing with broken symmetries - but wait, wouldn't it make some <br>
spectacular fireworks if we made a few stars collide at the end?!). <br>

For the sun, you have around 10^26 W to play with, I think it would <br>
definitely be intergalactically visible if you used a directed beam. <br>

<p>
The trick is to get the gravitational coupling to work - otherwise you get<br>
sails moving away from the star. Ideally the sails are heavy, just to drag<br>
the star along. But I think we could use the energy to induce flares on<br>
only one side instead or create a stellar laser, that ought to speed<br>
things up. <br>
