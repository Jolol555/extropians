[John K. Clark:]<br>
<i>&gt; Well that's a real nice start Eliezer, but you didn't complete it. Talking </i><br>
<i>&gt; about "a symbol" won't do, I want you to explain "the symbol", after all, </i><br>
<i>&gt; I didn't ask a general question but a very specific one. So please explain </i><br>
<i>&gt; all the information necessary for the formation of the symbol  "definition".</i><br>
<p>
I think it's a bit misleading, quoting only my quickie definition:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Definition (n):  An explanation intended to convey all information        </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;necessary for the formation of a symbol.</i><br>
<p>
You should at least note that this was the summary only and that I also<br>
included an explanation of all the cognitive objects associated with<br>
"explanation", "information", "formation", and "symbol".  This<br>
explanation was in turn the information necessary for the formation of<br>
the symbol "definition", as you say.<br>
<p>
I could also point to the subjective aspect of watching something being<br>
defined, and that would also be sufficient for defining the symbol<br>
"definition".  It would not, however, reduce the term "definition" to<br>
its causal constituents but instead ask you to accept the experiential<br>
aspect of definition as a conceptual primitive, which I deemed an unfair<br>
"out" - even though definition actually *is* a conceptual primitive, we<br>
can still attach a scientific explanation to our experience of that<br>
primitive.<br>
<p>
In other words, pointing to the subjective aspect would indeed define<br>
the symbol of "definition" and give it a referent, but not the<br>
*explanatory* (rather than experiential) referent you were looking for.<br>
<p>
So my answer is, I did explain all the information necessary for the<br>
formation of the symbol "definition".  I gave a detailed description of<br>
all the cognitive events associated with defining something.  Of<br>
*course* the quickie definition is circular:  It uses the phrase<br>
"formation of a symbol", which unless defined further, simply means:<br>
"defining a symbol".  The only way to break this circularity is to point<br>
to the cognitive processes involved in symbol formation, which can be<br>
defined (presumably) in terms of basic Turing processes.  Now, *those*<br>
you can't define except circularly.<br>
<p>
In any case, it strikes me as being a straw-man switch to call the<br>
summary "circular" and ignore the three paragraphs of cognitive science.<br>
