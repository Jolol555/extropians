Natasha More:<br>
<i>&gt;For example, Do Bono writes: &lt;snip&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I think that this the reference I was looking for a couple of months <br>
ago, when someone on the list tied in the idea of connections to the <br>
basic logical structure Do Bono refers to.  I believe the poster was <br>
speaking of inspiration as based in the connection of previously <br>
disparate ideas.<br>
<p>
I agree strongly that we need to remove the mysticism from the <br>
creative process, both to render it more accessible as an activity <br>
for everyone, and to deepen appreciation of what artists do <br>
accomplish through their skills and training.  I also think that the <br>
Western cultural discomfort with nonverbal communication plays a part <br>
in this insistence on treating artists as if they were divine conduits.  <br>
<p>
And yet I wonder whether people really want to understand the <br>
creative process, because having a basic knowledge of how it <br>
functions would remove a lot of excuses for not developing that set <br>
of skills, and taking the leap into unknown areas of life.  <br>
