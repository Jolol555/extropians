<i>&gt;There's something I don't understand about all the excitement over push.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seems to me that the push concept conflates two relatively independent</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas: content filtering, and when-available delivery.</i><br>
<p>
Thats all it is, just presented in a TV-like way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What worries me is that it is just going to be TV all over again -</i><br>
<i>&gt;the lowest common denominator.  Those areas which work best with push</i><br>
<i>&gt;are going to be the ones where information dribbles out all the time -</i><br>
<i>&gt;corporate press releases, soap operas, headline news, the stock market</i><br>
<i>&gt;ticker, the same old garbage.  That's not what I go to the web for.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The web is an infinite library, holding all kinds of information.</i><br>
<p>
Push won't replace pull, it will just complement it and act as a frontend<br>
to pull. There will be no major media networks as there are with<br>
television, you will be able to have your content streamed from anyone<br>
anywhere. You could put up a channel yourself just as you can put up a<br>
webpage today. The only thing that scares people into thinking it's more<br>
like television is how it's arranged very pretty like a presentation with<br>
lots of movement on the screen and information scrolling, blinking, and<br>
moving all over the place. PointCast Network or Microsoft won't be our sole<br>
information providers because microsoft has defined the tags to create push<br>
technology and released them to the public so everyone can do it and the<br>
standards will be adopted universally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The real problem is not in getting the information delivered, it is in</i><br>
<i>&gt;finding it.</i><br>
<p>
This is where profiles come in to learn about you, compare and contrast<br>
your interests with others like you and make suggestions aka "collective<br>
intelligence".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Once I've found a web page that provides a reasonably complete</i><br>
<i>&gt;overview of a field, with lots of other links to relevant pages, then I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a good source.  Yes, it would be useful to be notified when the links</i><br>
<i>&gt;change or some new information is provided.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly what push is.<br>
<p>
"Risk: You cannot discover new oceans unless you have the courage<br>
 to lose sight of the shore."<br>
