<i>&gt;Given this picture, I see two contrary stability concerns:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;TOO LITTLE COORDINATION -- These diverse entities may suffer severe</i><br>
<i>&gt;free rider problems regarding "public" goods such as national defense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hopefully donations, social pressure, and the self-interest of large</i><br>
<i>&gt;entities would be enough to get by.  But if coordination comes by</i><br>
<i>&gt;refusing to do business with entities that won't contribute, that may</i><br>
<i>&gt;be enough coordination to create the next problem:</i><br>
<p>
National defense is a valid issue for an anarchical society.  City-state<br>
cultures, which create an environment similar in many ways to that of a<br>
hypothetical anarchy, do have problems with national defense.  To be fair,<br>
the problems are not overwhelming - the city-state cultures of ancient<br>
Greece, Renaissance Italy, and early modern Germany fell to foreign conquest;<br>
but they all lasted a long time, and more conventional states get conquered<br>
too.<br>
<p>
I'm not aware of any other externalities that city-state systems, and by<br>
extension a more modern polycentric anarchy, don't handle.  Past ones have<br>
dealt with some really thorny ones like water rights and maritime law.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;TOO MUCH COORDINATION -- In some times and places, such small local</i><br>
<i>&gt;monopolies of force seem to have agreed to leave each other alone to</i><br>
<i>&gt;prey on their "citizens".  Coordination may allow them to punish</i><br>
<i>&gt;deviant entities which treat their people nicely and take in refugees.</i><br>
<i>&gt;We need to better understand why this happens so we can work to</i><br>
<i>&gt;prevent it.  </i><br>
<p>
This is why I think democratic city government plus an armed populace is a<br>
good way to handle basic personal security.  When the community provides its<br>
own protection, predatory government is rare.  Modern police forces are both<br>
accountable to their communites and lack the force to control the entire<br>
population; this is an ideal situation for watching the watchmen.  You could<br>
probably figure out ways for commercial security organization to be<br>
well-controlled, but why bother?<br>
