Child labor means, a force of underpaid, underaged, uneducated,  LABOR, ie:<br>
mining, printshops, industrial factories, etc<br>
It would not include, Mozart, Erkel or a software prodigy, or me selling<br>
paintings at  age fourteen....<br>
It is a history lesson in greed, poverty and human misery. But it is used,<br>
like any ANY issue involving children ( it seems pople go soft in the head<br>
when the word KIDS is involved and will vote for anything) as a *smoke<br>
screen* for the anti-freedom antics of our giovernment, like the new fuss<br>
about kids being perverted by free speech on the internet.  So it has become<br>
a popular axe to grind with libertarians, and vice versa.<br>
