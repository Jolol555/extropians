I am glad that you have tackled this question, as it often raises <br>
itself in my mind as well.<br>
Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;Benevolence and non-violence are probably not evolutionarily stable</i><br>
<i>&gt;strategies, in that they are susceptible to exploitation.  </i><br>
<p>
I refer you to Franz de Waal's _Peacemaking Among Primates_, which <br>
contains ethological studies of various primate species.  He wrote the <br>
book upon the discovery that each primate species has a unique social <br>
structure that contains a component of resolving disputes in a <br>
nonviolent manner, and that the behavior could be actively instigated <br>
by one or more members of the group.  <br>
<p>
The view that those who practice nonviolence and acts of benevolence <br>
are somehow more vulnerable fails to take into account the economic <br>
aspects of such behavior.  You mentioned that one on one relationships <br>
can be viewed as a contract--well, so can larger societal relationships.  <br>
Acts of benevolence cement the contracts, and they also represent <br>
expenditures that can be recouped in a later time of need.  The social <br>
contract:  If person A carries out an act of benevolence towards person <br>
B, and later person A is in need, it may not necessarily be person B who <br>
grants an act of benevolence to person A, but person C would upon the <br>
expectation that s/he would also be helped in a time of need.  Acts of <br>
non-benevolence will break this contract, and acts of violence will <br>
void it altogether.<br>
<p>
(Now that nonviolence has been mentioned, I predict that within three <br>
postings we'll have an argument about gun control...prove me wrong, <br>
please!)<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
