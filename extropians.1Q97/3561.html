I've been spending the past while doing lots of thinking about things; about <br>
all kinds of things --  <br>
<p>
I've been playing around with ALL kinds of things in my environment; studying <br>
*everything* very intently, seeing what I can do with various kinds of objects <br>
and discovering the properties, features and usefulness of everyday items, <br>
such as::  my hands, pieces of cloth, strings and rope, pipes and dope,  with <br>
bedrooms and mushrooms, paper and pens, there's just so many things I can do <br>
with my hands!  <br>
<p>
And yet I feel like I'm just beginning -- I see so **many**  //possibilities\\ <br>
for further exploration, for further playings with my reality ((all safe and <br>
hygenic, of course)).<br>
<p>
I'm essentially turning the whole world into my playground, and now it doesn't <br>
seem so big and terrifying any more.  Now things look interesting and fun and <br>
full of possibilities.  I know sometimes I or others will make mistakes and <br>
sometimes people will be hurt, but I _also know that we will learn from our <br>
actions and the actions of others, and we will improve our performance, become <br>
less harmful, less wasteful, more careful and mindful in all of our actions.<br>
<p>
Whether our world is terrifying, violent and destructive, or whether our world <br>
is safe, inviting and comfortable, is almost entirely up to us.  We choose how <br>
we behave, and we choose what sorts of environments we create.  We can <br>
basically decide what kind of a world we want to live in and then create the <br>
sort of reality we love. <br>
<p>
We are the masters here; we are intelligent, and we learn quickly; we study <br>
the world and learn how it works and how we can manipulate it to be the way we <br>
want it to be.  If something isn't quite right, we'll work on it and make it <br>
right.  We are in the process of continual improvement, and this process has <br>
been continuing on for longer than I can fathom right now.  <br>
<p>
This is just so amazing!  This whole reality is so fascinating to me; the more <br>
I learn, the deeper my curiosity grows.  I want to understand it all; it's so <br>
beautiful; and it's right there in front of me and all around me and through <br>
me.  It  - i s -  me.  <br>
<p>
Now ^there's^ an interesting idea;  I am all that I am aware of and all that I <br>
influence.  I have a certain pattern to myself; I am unique; and the influence <br>
of what I am spreads all around me in various ways as I make changes; as I <br>
think and move and communicate.  My influence spreads everywhere; tending to <br>
become mixed up in larger and smaller processes.  I can cause the atoms in my <br>
hand to move faster, by rubbing it on something else;  I can influence the <br>
minds of other humans by presenting them with attractive ideas, which they <br>
incorporate into the process of themselves.  I can also observe and be <br>
conscious of much of the world, through various means --- I can use my senses <br>
to gather information, and I can notice patterns and regularities in that <br>
information and understand the signifigance of my experiences and eventually <br>
perceive the larger patterns and processes I'm involved in.<br>
<p>
As I grow, my awareness and my influence also grows  --  I *AM* my awareness <br>
and influence.  I seem to be woven seamlessly into other people and into the <br>
elements of the physical world -- we all influence and are aware of each other <br>
to a high degree.  There are still differences between us; every system seems <br>
to be unique.  There are individuals.  We are also all deeply connected to <br>
each other; each individual connected to all others in a relationship which is <br>
itseslf unique among all relationships.  The relationship itself is also an <br>
individual.  Hmmm.....interesting thought space around this idea....<br>

You know, this writing is actually quite good for having eaten as much <br>
psychedellic mushrooms and cannabis as I've been eating.  I don't know why the <br>
popular image of these plants is that they are harmful and make you stupid.  <br>
The state of clarity I'm experiencing is very beautiful, and my intellectual <br>
and physical abilities seem quite available to me; in many ways; I feel <br>
ENHANCED; I feel much better than I did before I started using this stuff.  <br>
Although, most of that has to do with the discipline of mind that I've been <br>
developing, but the herbs do seem to be helping me out a lot.  Without them, <br>
I'd still excell (actually I'd just find a way to manufacture the same kind of <br>
chemicals the plants do in my own body; the body can make all kinds of <br>
chemicals, especially the brain... make your own dope, right inside your own <br>
body, custom-made, just how you want it!  What a deal!)  <br>
<p>
It's the people that use drugs improperly that give them such a bad <br>
reputation.  It's not the drugs that are bad; the drugs simply exist; it's how <br>
we use them that may be good or bad.  When used properly, drugs can be very <br>
beneficial; but when they're used improperly; they can become deadly.  Very <br>
much like knives in that way -- beneficial when used carefully and <br>
intelligently, but dangerous when used unthinkingly and ignorantly.<br>
<p>
Well, my mind is full of ideas, and I don't want to download all of them into <br>
this message, so I will end it shortly, but I exist, and will share my <br>
summations and creations of reality with you often.<br>
<p>
Thank you for your attention,<br>
