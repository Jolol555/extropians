<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;What happened in mid to late seventies was that a few bands, mainly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;europeans,  started to experiment with completely electronic music.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Um, the first Kraftwerk album was 1970 or 71, as was the first Cluster</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;album (why Cluster is always forgotten in these dicussions, I'll never</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;know).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gee, if we're going to be picky, what about Isao Tomita, Klaus Schultze (sp?),</i><br>
<i>&gt;Morton Subotnic, Walter Carlos, Jan Hammer, Vangellis, Larry Fast...</i><br>
<p>
Subotnic preceeded, yes.  Carlos was around the same time, but doing<br>
baroque music on Moogs, not creating a new music.  The others came<br>
after (Cluster started in 1969).  Silver Apples slightly preceeded<br>
Cluster in 1968, but they were more of a rock band with oscillators<br>
than creaters of electronica.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is very different from the way I've seen it.  The early electronic</i><br>
<i>&gt;guys (up to the early '70's) were doing weird stuff, avant garde, exploring</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they thought were the frontiers of sound and musical structure.  Sure,</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the same time there were people incorporating electronics into more</i><br>
<i>&gt;traditional and popular music, but electronics still had a raw, new sound,</i><br>
<i>&gt;a sound of pure possibility.  In some ways it seemed more organic than</i><br>
<i>&gt;"natural" sound.  </i><br>
<p>
I hate to keep repeating myself, but I find this to be especially true<br>
of Cluster.  There's something very "human" about their sounds that's<br>
quite different from especially later Kraftwerk.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Somehow it all seemed to fall apart around 1978--just when sampled keyboards</i><br>
<i>&gt;and FM synthesis came out, making the old analog methods obsolete.  Musicians</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't want to explore ur-sound or frontier sound, they wanted to push</i><br>
<i>&gt;buttons to make sounds they already knew about, whether "acoustic" (bank A)</i><br>
<i>&gt;or "electronic" (bank B--for instance my keyboard has a sound called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Kraftwerk").</i><br>
<p>
I agree wholeheartedly.  The thing that's especially true of digital<br>
snths is that they lack imperfections.  As we all know, the brain is<br>
stimulated by differences: it filters out the steady-state stimulous.<br>
Analogue synths are quirky, they drift, and they wobble.  If you play<br>
a note over and over, it's slightly different each time.  The same is<br>
not true of (most) digital synthesizers, which is why I don't like<br>
them in general.  That's not to say that you can't program in much<br>
more interesting variations, but it's rare that people do so.<br>
<p>
Another effect of the digital synth revolution is the tossing away of<br>
real-time control.  Analogue synths have lots of knobs to tweak the<br>
sounds while you're playing.  Digital synths almost never do (cf. the<br>
"revolutionary" new Kawai keyboard that adds the knobs back).  They<br>
also added lots of presets (presets were very limited before).  And<br>
synthesis methods such as FM were less amenable to real-time<br>
tweaking.  All this conspired to make keyboard players click in the<br>
preset, and leave the sound static as they played.<br>
<p>
Yuk.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That probably sounds like a contradiction to my praise of Kraftwerk's</i><br>
<i>&gt;irony.  But my point was that Kraftwerk are both "in" it and putting it</i><br>
<i>&gt;"on."  Besides, they were in there early doing some of the real exploration</i><br>
<i>&gt;stuff--like that comb filter sweep and wooden flute piece on the back</i><br>
<i>&gt;side of "Autobahn"--stuff that would throw your mind into a different</i><br>
<i>&gt;place.</i><br>
<p>
And they were doing it before they had synths.  Have you heard the<br>
Organization record?  Pretty neat.<br>
