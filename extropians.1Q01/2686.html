<p>Oh, they will.  Even with new technologies, speeding will once again 
<br>
be the targeted infraction, since it will be the easiest to enforce - 
<br>
while other (seems to me) more dangerous infractions, like sailing 
<br>
through red lights will remain common and relatively unpunished.

</em><br>
<p>[some good ideas snipped]
<br>
<p>Oh, the number of times I've pitched very similar ideas to friends 
<br>
and family.  I would willingly take extra classes, conform to more 
<br>
stringent car requirements, and even subject myself to checkpoint 
<br>
verifications - whatever it would take.
<br>
<p>One time, I tried to teach my grandmother how to play Frogger on the 
<br>
computer.  She gave it a good effort, but her hand-eye coordination 
<br>
were such that it was hopeless.  She could barely get across a couple 
<br>
of lanes of traffic after we played around with it for an hour.  How 
<br>
on earth is it that this dear, sweet, but spastic lady and I are 
<br>
bound by the exact same rules for driving?  When you also consider 
<br>
that she drives a big unwieldy boat-sized Cadillac, and I drive a 
<br>
small nimble S2000, the performance gap between the two of us on the 
<br>
road is wider still.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this nation's equality of outcome mentality restricts 
<br>
us from being able to consider that different drivers might have 
<br>
drastically different levels of ability.
<br>
<p>It wouldn't hurt if the driving community were treated a bit more 
<br>
like the flying community.  I took flying lessons last year, and the 
<br>
commitment level of pilots vs the commitment level of drivers is so 
<br>
stark.
<br>
<p>Learning to drive a car was a joke.  If you could just achieve basic 
<br>
mastery of the skills needed, you were done.  Communication issues, 
<br>
like using turn signals; emergency issues, like what to do if you hit 
<br>
an ice patch; and protocol issues, like how to handle an intersection 
<br>
with the lights out were just mentioned briefly during drivers' ed.
<br>
<p>In flying, you're *required* to work on your communication skills 
<br>
until you get it down pat.  In flying, you're actually placed in 
<br>
emergency situations and trained to handle them in a step-by-step 
<br>
manner.  In flying, you circle round and round the traffic pattern, 
<br>
communicating your position and intentions until it becomes second 
<br>
nature.  It's more than just about practicing until you can basically 
<br>
&quot;get by&quot;.  Pilots who can just &quot;get by&quot; don't &quot;get by&quot; FAA examiners 
<br>
the way that drivers &quot;get by&quot; DMV testers.
<br>
<p>The flying world also allows for different privileges given to pilots 
<br>
with different levels of training, which speaks more to the ideas you 
<br>
mentioned, Greg.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
<br>
<p>PS.  No, I don't have my VFR license yet.  I've got all my 
<br>
requirements out of the way except for testing - which I haven't yet 
<br>
found time to complete.  Maybe this summer. :P
