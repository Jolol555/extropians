&nbsp;&nbsp;Last I'd heard, the aluminum/Alzheimer link was on the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;outs. But key words &quot; alzheimer aluminum &quot; at PubMed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed</a>) found several
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;resent studies suggesting a connection. In fact,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one study, the abstract of which is below, states:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excess, insoluble amyloid beta protein (A beta)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contributes to AD [Alzheimer's disease]. Aluminum
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promotes formation and accumulation of insoluble
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beta and hyperphosphorylated tau.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neurotoxicology, 2000 Oct;21(5):813-28.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggests to me that researchers have found that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aluminum Can play a contributory role in AD pathology.

<p>Relation between aluminum concentrations in drinking water

<br>
<p>To investigate the effect of aluminum and silica in drinking
<br>
water on the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, the
<br>
authors analyzed data from a large prospective cohort (Paquid),
<br>
including 3,777 subjects aged 65 years and over living at home
<br>
in 75 civil parishes in Gironde and Dordogne in southwestern
<br>
France in 1988-1989. The subjects were followed for up for 8
<br>
years with an active search for incident cases of dementia or
<br>
Alzheimer's disease. Mean exposure to aluminum and silica in
<br>
drinking water was estimated in each area. The sample studied
<br>
included 2,698 nondemented subjects at baseline, for whom
<br>
components of drinking water and covariates were available. A
<br>
total of 253 incident cases of dementia (with 17 exposed to
<br>
high levels of aluminum), including 182 Alzheimer's disease
<br>
(with 13 exposed to high aluminum levels), were identified.
<br>
The relative risk of dementia adjusted for age, gender,
<br>
educational level, place of residence, and wine consumption
<br>
was 1.99 (95 percent CI: 1.20, 3.28) for subjects exposed to
<br>
an aluminum concentration greater than 0.1 mg/liter. This
<br>
result was confirmed for Alzheimer's disease (adjusted relative
<br>
risk = 2.14, 95 percent CI: 1.21, 3.80). However, no dose-
<br>
response relation was found. Inversely, the adjusted relative
<br>
risk of dementia for subjects exposed to silica (&gt; or = 11.25
<br>
mg/liter) was 0.74 (95 percent CI: 0.58, 0.96). These findings
<br>
support the hypothesis that a high concentration of aluminum in
<br>
drinking water may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

<p>The toxicology of aluminum in the brain: a review.

<br>
<p>Aluminum is environmentally ubiquitous, providing human exposure.
<br>
Usual human exposure is primarily dietary. The potential for
<br>
significant Al absorption from the nasal cavity and direct
<br>
distribution into the brain should be further investigated.
<br>
Decreased renal function increases human risk of Al-induced
<br>
accumulation and toxicity. Brain Al entry from blood may involve
<br>
transferrin-receptor mediated endocytosis and a more rapid process
<br>
transporting small molecular weight Al species. There appears to
<br>
be Al efflux from the brain, probably as Al citrate. There is
<br>
prolonged retention of a fraction of Al that enters the brain,
<br>
suggesting the potential for accumulation with repeated exposure.
<br>
Al is a neurotoxicant in animals and humans. It has been implicated
<br>
in the etiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other
<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, although this is highly controversial.
<br>
This controversy has not been resolved by epidemiological studies,
<br>
as only some found a small association between increased incidence
<br>
of dementia and drinking water Al concentration. Studies of brain Al
<br>
in AD have not produced consistent findings and have not resolved
<br>
the controversy. Injections of Al to animals produce behavioral,
<br>
neuropathological and neurochemical changes that partially model AD.
<br>
Aluminum has the ability to produce neurotoxicity by many mechanisms.
<br>
Excess, insoluble amyloid beta protein (A beta) contributes to AD.
<br>
Aluminum promotes formation and accumulation of insoluble A beta
<br>
and hyperphosphorylated tau. To some extent, Al mimics the deficit
<br>
of cortical cholinergic neurotransmission seen in AD. Al increases
<br>
Fe-induced oxidative injury. The toxicity of Al to plants, aquatic
<br>
life and humans may share common mechanisms, including disruption
<br>
of the inositol phosphate system and Ca regulation. Facilitation
<br>
of Fe-induced oxidative injury and disruption of basic cell processes
<br>
may mediate primary molecular mechanisms of Al-induced neurotoxicity.
<br>
Avoidance of Al exposure, when practical, seems prudent.

<br>
<p>Aluminum forms in drinking water and risk of Alzheimer's disease

<br>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the relation between
<br>
long-term exposure to different aluminum (Al) forms in drinking
<br>
water and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study participants were
<br>
selected from a random sample of the elderly population (&gt;/=70
<br>
years of age) of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region (Quebec).
<br>
Sixty-eight cases of Alzheimer's disease diagnosed according to
<br>
recognized criteria were paired for age (+/-2 years) and sex with
<br>
nondemented controls. Aluminum speciation was assessed using
<br>
established standard analytical protocols along with quality
<br>
control procedures. Exposure to Al forms (total Al, total
<br>
dissolved Al, monomeric organic Al, monomeric inorganic Al,
<br>
polymeric Al, Al(3+), AlOH, AlF, AlH(3)SiO(2+)(4), AlSO(4)) in
<br>
drinking water was estimated by juxtaposing the subject's
<br>
residential history with the physicochemical data of the
<br>
municipalities. The markers of long-term exposures (1945 to onset)
<br>
to Al forms in drinking water were not significantly associated
<br>
with AD. On the other hand, after adjustment for education level,
<br>
presence of family cases, and ApoE varepsilon4 allele, exposure
<br>
to organic monomeric aluminum estimated at the onset of the
<br>
disease was associated with AD (odds ratio 2.67; 95% CI 1.04-6.90).
<br>
On average, the exposure estimated at the onset had been stable
<br>
for 44 years. Our results confirm prime the importance of
<br>
estimation of Al speciation and consideration of genetic
<br>
characteristics in the assessment of the association between
<br>
aluminum exposure and Alzheimer's disease. Copyright 2000
