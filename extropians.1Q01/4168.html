<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;The &quot;inner core&quot; of PETA is also again't pet ownership (or was)
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;unaware of.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why do you say that?  I would think that most PETA members would also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be against pet ownership.  The concept of owning an animal seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;conflict with the concept of animal rights or returning animals to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their natural state.  I am not aware of any animal-rights activists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;who would support pet ownership.  The two concepts appear to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;incompatible to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you're assuming that these people think about their beliefs in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical way and try to resolve the inconsitencies they find. That would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an incorrect assumption. A lot of animal rights people speak favorably of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having &quot;animal companions&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Having dated an ex-PETA member, I think a lot of the talk on this thread has
<br>
been bullshit.  In general, PETA wants to phase out pet ownership.  My ex
<br>
believed pets to be an intrusion of humanity into other species.  He did not
<br>
want to see pets go unowned, but just to have all of them desexed.
<br>
<p>His reasoning was based on his repugnance with animal suffering.  How does
<br>
one leap from having pets to animal suffering?  His argument went like this.
<br>
Many pets will be breed in excess of what people actually will keep as pets.
<br>
Many pets will be abandoned.  These will breed even more and become a public
<br>
nuisance.
<br>
<p>I don't agree with this reasoning, but it is not exactly totally illogical.
<br>
(At the same time, I don't have any pets, but that's because a) I find most
<br>
animals (including humans) disgusting and filthy and b) I don't have the
<br>
time or space to care them.)
<br>
<p>BTW, has anyone here read any of Peter Singer's works?  He's the big animal
<br>
rights philosopher.  I read his _How Are We To Live?_ several years ago and
<br>
found it wanting.  He assumes a cleavage between being moral and being
<br>
happy -- doing what you ought to do as opposed to doing what you want to do.
<br>
His basic view of morality is as a collection of duties, however
<br>
systematically grouped together they might be.  (I wrote to him on the
<br>
subject before he came to Princeton, but got a form letter reply.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
