<em>&gt;I know of no court opinion or statute that would prevent deep linking per se.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You probably face a bluff, and a dumb one at that.
</em><br>
<p>That's my impression too, after reading several articles over the last day 
<br>
or so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I can imagine a successful claim that relies on a showing that the linking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;party *agreed* to not engage in deep linking, said agreement most likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arising by way of a click-through license on the plaintiff's homepage.
</em><br>
<p>In the case that concerns me, I have never seen any agreement that I had to 
<br>
make before viewing content.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Framing a deep-linked site (or any site, for that matter) may, if done in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particularly misleading way, give rise to an unfair competition claim.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I have no problem with that. Using someone else's content and 
<br>
putting your own frame and advertising around it, making it appear to be 
<br>
yours, is likely to be misleading. In the case that I'm concerned about 
<br>
this is not an issue. The site concerned simply describes and evaluates 
<br>
content found elsewhere. When you click on the link (which is the title), a 
<br>
new browser winder opens up and looks exactly the same as if someone had 
<br>
gone directly to the page in the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Absent that, I can imagine a claim only if the use that results from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hyperlink somehow harms the site being linked to.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and again in this case far from harming the others sites, they are 
<br>
receiving a free benefit of traffic that they otherwise would not have 
<br>
received. They might like people to first go through at least a contents 
<br>
page, but the fact is that these are visitors who would not otherwise have 
<br>
gone to that page if not for the recommendation.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your input, T0M. Much appreciated!
