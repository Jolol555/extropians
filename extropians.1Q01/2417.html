<em>&gt; AT LAST! LIGHT BROUGHT TO A HALT.  For the first time,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics led by Ron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Walsworth (617-495-7274) and Mikhail Lukin (617-496-7611) has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) slowed the pulse's &quot;group velocity&quot; to zero and (2) stored its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information in the form of an atomic &quot;spin wave,&quot; a collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excitation in the Rb atoms.  (A spin wave can be visualized as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective pattern in the orientation of the atoms, which spin like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tops and hence act like tiny bar magnets. &quot;Spin&quot; is merely the name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the tiny magnetic vector in each of the atoms.)  The atomic spin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wave is coherent and long-lived, which enables the researchers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store the light pulse's information and then convert it back into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light pulse with the same properties as the original pulse.  This new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishment in a simple system increases the promise for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum communication, which may someday be used to connect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially ultrafast quantum computers in a large network
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogous to the Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Usually photons (the quanta of light) are absorbed by atoms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying the information carried by the light.  With the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method, in principle, no information in the light pulse is lost. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Previous efforts to slow light (such as Hau et al., Nature, 18
</em><br>
<em>&gt; February 1999) have reduced the signal speed to about 1 mph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Update 472) by using a process called electromagnetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; induced transparency (EIT; see Updates 37, 344 and Stephen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harris's article in Physics Today, July 1997). Walsworth, Lukin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and colleagues have gone the rest of the way to a zero light-pulse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed by using a novel technique which was recently proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretically (Lukin, Yelin and Fleischhauer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; May 2000; Fleischhauer and Lukin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 29 May
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2000).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The light storage experiment begins with the Harvard-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smithsonian scientists shining a &quot;control&quot; laser beam into a glass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell filled with rubidium vapor (about 70-90 degrees Celsius),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which puts the atoms into a conventional EIT state in which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot absorb light in the traditional sense.  The scientists then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; send in a &quot;signal&quot; pulse of light which contains the information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they want to store.  As the pulse enters the rubidium cell its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propagation speed is reduced to about 2,000 mph.  Since the front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; edge of the signal pulse enters the cell (and hence is decelerated)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first, the pulse experiences dramatic spatial compression: from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several kilometers in free-space to a few centimeters inside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rubidium vapor.  The light in the vapor cell interacts with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atoms (see figure at <a href="http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics">http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics</a>),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changing the atoms' spin states coherently and creating a joint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atom-photon system known as a polariton.  (For a nice descriptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of polaritons see Phys Rev Focus, 26 April 2000:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://focus.aps.org/v5/st19.html">http://focus.aps.org/v5/st19.html</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The light-atom interaction causes the polaritons to act as if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have an effective mass; so one way to understand the signal pulse's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduced speed is that the mixture with atoms, in the form of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polariton, effectively weighs down the otherwise massless photons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next, the Harvard-Smithsonian scientists stop the signal pulse of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light by gradually turning off the control beam, which causes more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atoms to be mixed with fewer photons, thereby increasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polariton mass and further reducing the signal pulse's speed.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the control beam is completely off the polariton is purely atomic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the light pulse is effectively halted, and no signal pulse emerges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the glass cell during the storage period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     At this point there are no photons remaining in the cell.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light does not go into warming of the atoms, as is the usual case.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead the photons are expended in the creation of the atomic spin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wave.  Thus, the information that the light pulse carried (all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can know about the photons) is stored in the atomic spin wave,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waiting to be released as a light pulse that is in principle identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the incident pulse. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    An alternative way to understand the slowing of light is to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the signal pulse as a wave made of many different components,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each with a different frequency.  The Rb atoms bend or &quot;refract&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual components of the light by different amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on each component's frequency.  The vapor cell's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequency-dependent index of refraction causes the component
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waves to add together in such a way that the group velocity, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; velocity of the composite pulse, slows appreciably.  The dimming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the control beam makes the vapor's index of refraction more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sharply dependent on frequency, and this serves to reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group velocity further.  The dimming causes the atoms to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparent to a narrower range of frequencies.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously, the light wave (or more precisely, the combination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of light wave and atomic spin wave) is continually slowing down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintaining its shape but narrowing its range of component
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequencies so that the atoms are still unable to absorb it.  After a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively long delay the control beam can be turned back on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverting the polariton to being a light wave by coaxing the atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to emit the exact signal light pulse that entered the medium.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     In brief: (1) the length of a light pulse is compressed from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kilometers to centimeters in a properly-prepared rubidium vapor;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) the information carried by the light pulse is then imprinted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon the ensemble of rubidium atoms in the form of long-lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spin waves; and (3) the light pulse can later be read out on demand. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This new light storage method is robust because information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintained in collective atomic spin states, which are much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensitive to dissipation, losses, and quantum-computer-crashing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decoherence effects than are excited electronic states in atoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Scientists believe that the light storage method is quite general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that the simplicity of its implementation is a big advantage. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They even speculate that the technique may be utilized in certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solid-state materials.  The Harvard-Smithsonian demonstration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment is exciting news for scientists worried about preserving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the coherence of quantum information transfer.  With further work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this technique should allow for the storage and transmission of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; photon quantum states useful for quantum communication and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation.  (Phillips et al., Physical Review Letters, 29 January
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2001.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Walsworth and Lukin say that a very similar result has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently obtained by  Lene Hau's group (Harvard/Rowland Institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Science) in an ultra-cold atomic gas.  In addition, an upcoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory paper (Kocharavskaya et al., Phys Rev. Lett., 22 January)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discusses a novel technique for making a light beam not only stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in its tracks but reverse its direction; this effect could be useful for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-linear optics applications.
