<br>
<em>&gt; Ugh - I read this with dread.  As someone who has always gotten pleasure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of high-performance cars (and other machines) (see:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch3/cars.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch3/cars.html</a>), I sincerely hope this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology WILL be used to improve the safety and reliability of autos and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other transportation technology, but that it won't tempt the nannies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; castrate high-performance cars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I wouldn't at all mind seeing and something I've thought about before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is employing technology to allow multiple classes of driver's licenses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to regulate speed in proportion to a machine's capabilities and the road
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions it encounters.  I would gladly pay more for, take a test to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and tolerate some slight intrusion into my road-going privacy to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to legally drive faster than current law allows.
</em><br>
<p>The speed limiting technology is mainly concerned about pedestrian deaths
<br>
and injuries in built-up areas. A pedestrian hit at 40 mph will almost
<br>
certainly die - at 30 mph half will survive. That is why enforcing 30 mph in
<br>
towns is considered to be important. Drivers have an incidental benefit as
<br>
they and their cars will also suffer less injury in low-speed shunts.
<br>
<p>There is no theoretical barrier to having unlimited speed areas on freeways
<br>
at certain times. But you would never get the laws passed to permit it as
<br>
there would always be a mix of capabilities of cars and drivers at all
<br>
times. Here in UK the freeways are busy at all times of the day and night -
<br>
it's a crowded little country! :-)

<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think laws generally tend to be too strict when they are difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce, so that they are easier to enforce in those cases when they *can*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be enforced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once technology develops to allow a law to be enforced more easily, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law itself needs to be adapted. The assumption that something is difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to enforce is usually designed into laws, so when this assumption stops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being true, the law needs to evolve consistently - in the spirit of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the law was originally meant to achieve, not in the spirit of what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letter of the law currently says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am looking forward towards a time when technology will enable us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit ourselves to good behavior by means of technology rather than by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means of law. However, I fear that some dumbsters in charge won't realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that existing laws *do* need to be reconsidered and adapted once this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes place. If they are not, this could easily lead to an Orvellian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society.
</em><br>
<p>This is what I was getting at. As the transparent society technology
<br>
approaches, society will increasingly face the dilemma of what to do when
<br>
they find that under the existing laws &quot;everyone&quot; is a criminal in some
<br>
aspect of their life. The USA found that the Prohibition laws were ruining
<br>
their society so they scrapped them. Today the USA prisons are filling up
<br>
with soft drugs users and again ruining many lives unnecessarily. The
<br>
prisons will continue to fill up until they see sense once again.
<br>
<p>Advanced technology can be used to detect more and more &quot;crime&quot; but there is
<br>
no point to it. Prison will have to be restricted to serious criminals. I
<br>
see this speed limit technology as a sign of the way things will go in the
<br>
future. Rather than detection and punishment , which is very expensive,
<br>
society will go the cheaper route of either stopping the crime from
<br>
happening or scrapping minor offences which are too much trouble to bother
<br>
with.
<br>
<p>Automatic speed limits, surveillance cameras, tagged goods in shops,
<br>
prisoner 'tagging' with ankle bracelets, etc., are all methods of stopping
<br>
the crime from ever happening. And there will be much more of this coming
<br>
soon.  Watch this space!
