<p>Ayup, doing the same up here in NH would keep the cops busy all day
<br>
long. 2/3 of all vehicles are either SUVs or pickups up here. The main
<br>
targets of cops around here are those tinted window humpa-thumpa mobile
<br>
stereo systems with neon and/or gold trim. Typically they're either
<br>
flatlander gangstas or local teenage wanna-gangsta-bees. The cops also
<br>
hang outside known trailer trash watering holes and do quite well on DWI
<br>
busts.
