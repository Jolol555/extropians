<em>&gt; I'll start by agreeing that first price auctions aren't unreasonable

</em><br>
<em>&gt; market is appropriate.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want to clear up some terminology first. I don't think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate to refer to this as a &quot;first price&quot; auction.  You said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the highest-price rule (also called first-price auction rules).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I understand what I've read, there is a continuing auction for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power throughout the day, which can be treated as a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auctions.  If they were first price auctions, then each of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auctions throughout the day would be settled at the highest price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bid.  (Second price auctions settle at the price bid by the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highest bidder, which reduces the incentives for buyers to exagerate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their desire for the commodity.)  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the California power market, (as I understand it) there are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series of auctions throughout the day, each one awarding power to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highest bidder.  At the end of the day, the highest clearing price for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of the day's auctions is charged to all the winning bidders.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this institution, it's possible for the price someone pays to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled by auctions in which they didn't participate at all!
</em><br>
<p>I agree that this terminology is somewhat confusing, but it seems to be
<br>
used universally to describe the California electronic markets.  Documents
<br>
linked from <a href="http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/11/01/2000110112414127623.html">http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/11/01/2000110112414127623.html</a>
<br>
describe the recent analysis and order by the Federal Energy Regulatory
<br>
Commision.  The press release from 11-01-2000 includes the following orders:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single price auctions would be used for all sales in the ISO and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PX markets at or below $150 per MWh. The single price would be used
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all load which clears below this amount in the auctions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an auction does not clear below the $150 per MWh level, suppliers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who choose to bid above $150 would be paid their bid price. This
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanism reflects the value of scarce generation capacity in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market, but it does not allow sellers to systematically set the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearing price for the entire market. In other words, the highest bid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price paid by all.
<br>
<p>Here, as in all the FERC documents, they call the California auction
<br>
a single price auction, but as the last sentence makes clear they are
<br>
referring to the highest bid of the day as the clearing price which
<br>
everyone pays.
<br>
<p>Here is a discussion from the FERC staff report, chapter 5, where again
<br>
the California markets are called &quot;single-price&quot;:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Cal-ISO and the PX use a single-price rule for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;establishing real time energy prices. That is, the market-clearing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price (which is based on the highest accepted bid) is paid to all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepted sellers, including those who bid less than the price. To
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevent future price spikes, some have proposed an alternative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pricing rule paying each accepted seller its bid, rather than the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market-clearing price. Buyers would then pay a price reflecting the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average of the accepted sellers' bids. Proponents of the pay-as-bid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule argue that consumers would pay less in total during high demand
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periods, on the grounds that consumers would pay less than the highest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepted bid to suppliers who bid less. However, generators are not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely to bid under a pay-as-bid rule in the same way as under the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;single-price rule. Sellers bidding below the market-clearing price
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will receive that price under the single-price rule, but they will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive only their bid under the pay-as-bid rule. So generators
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will generally submit higher bids under a pay-as-bid rule. In sum,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not clear whether a pay-as-bid rule would have the effect of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowering consumers' bills.
<br>
<p>Here the staff report is making the same argument I did, which is that
<br>
changing the auction rules can have unexpected results as the participants
<br>
modify their behavior to suit the rules.
<br>
<p>In most of the FERC documents there is no explicit mention of the fact
<br>
that the time period for the single-price auction is a full day rather
<br>
than one hour.  The auctions are bid on an hour by hour basis but it
<br>
does appear that the &quot;market clearing price&quot; is taken as the maximum
<br>
for the whole day, as the FERC press release above mentions.
<br>
<p>I agree with Chris's points that this seems to be an odd way of
<br>
looking at the electrical market, since the price fluctuates so much
<br>
during the day.  Obviously the market rules were established through a
<br>
political process, but the utility companies who are so harmed by this
<br>
rule were important and influential participants.  I think there must
<br>
be some body of literature which explains why the markets work this way.
<br>
I have been looking for some kind of academic analysis of the California
<br>
power market which explains this feature, but I have not yet found one.
<br>
I'll report further if I can find a better explanation.
