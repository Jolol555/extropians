</em><br>
<p>True, but if one has to invest, you can't beat the advice of Warren
<br>
Buffet, who does say to invest in companies that make things you use,
<br>
and he sure hasn't done too badly on that strategy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A better strategy is to invest in good companies that don't do anything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't like (say, donating money to HCI, for example).  About half the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies on your list are marginal or speculative investments that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably do relatively poorly as a group.  For example, gun companies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally a poor investment -- I wouldn't qualify their outlook as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly high growth.
</em><br>
<p>Gun companies are *currently* a poor investment, but are actually a very
<br>
good value due to current public hysteria and anti-gun propagandizing
<br>
(though there is the effect of sales going up every time some nut wants
<br>
to pass another ban...). At one point in the 80's, Texaco was a very
<br>
poor investment due to a $12 billion judgement against them to be paid
<br>
to Pennzoil. A year later the judgement was settled for $2 billion and I
<br>
tripled my money.  Based on this, if you think that tort reform of one
<br>
kind or another is likely in the next few years, invest in gun, tobacco,
<br>
civil aircraft, chemical, and step-ladder companies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the point of this exercise is to use our collective foresight to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict what companies are likely to be the leaders in technology fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will become huge (and profitable) in the future, gaining growth via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our presumed ability to accurately identify important ground floor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology ventures so that we can profit from explosive growth.  Balance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that with a few smart blue chips like IBM and Merck, and you have a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis for a mutual fund.
</em><br>
<p>I thought I was. Given increasing energy demand due to the internet (if
<br>
13% increase in power demand in California is any indication), stocks
<br>
like GE and Westinghouse should be nice secure growing stocks. Given
<br>
increased defense spending under Bush, Boeing and Lockheed stand to gain
<br>
the most. All four are rather secure stocks.
<br>
<p>SeaLaunch cuts launch costs so should pick up market share as it gets
<br>
off the ground. Whether the consortium puts its stock on the market is
<br>
another question. Orbital and Kistler stand to do well as space is
<br>
privatized more and launchers come on line.
