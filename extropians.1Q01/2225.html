<p>He doesn't say what kind of chip. You wouldn't get very much in an
<br>
easily attainable (effective power at the user end, using mainstream
<br>
development tools and vanilla developers) absolute performance for 
<br>
a single dollar in 2000. If he says  &quot;Internet&quot;, he doesn't say 
<br>
whether he means the matrix (switches, routers) or the connected 
<br>
nodes running the clients. Currently, there is a large difference
<br>
between these two.
<br>
<p>The actual hardware prices are relatively irrelevant for switches
<br>
and routers, as the complexity of the switching bare metal is low.
<br>
The sofware layer is the dominant part, and being speciality
<br>
items, the things have a high price markup. Instead of a trunk
<br>
and tree/leaf mentality, using low end hardware on locally-connected
<br>
grids would scale better and have a better price/performance ratio.
<br>
<p>Of course the performance of individual routers grows, but I very 
<br>
much doubt they constitute the bottleneck of Internet growth. I 
<br>
suspect the bottleneck to be present in the missing last mile (same
<br>
tree/leaf thinking again, but the problem is real as long people
<br>
believe in it), and too much copper instead of fiber, and
<br>
in politicking (if I have surplus bandwidth I won't sell it to my
<br>
competitors, same thing vice versa).
<br>
<p>The desktop bloat can absorb any amount of hardware thrown at
<br>
it. The current lull in domestic market PC sales seems to 
<br>
indicate that these people who intended to buy a PC now already 
<br>
have one, and that it does fit their current and near future needs. 
<br>
This is not true for large parts of the world. We certainly have
<br>
this more than compensated on server, infrastructure, gaming and
<br>
embedded market. Reality simulation is expensive, so as long people
<br>
buy gaming gear, hot silicon will sell there. New killer applications
<br>
might emerge, such as real voice recognition, which will require
<br>
order of magnitude more crunch than current machines can provide.
<br>
The PDA and the cellphone will see convergent evolution. We might
<br>
be almost ready for the Dynabook, even. The wearable market does 
<br>
not even exist yet. The home automation market ditto. As is vehicular
<br>
navigation and entertainment. And the Internet, of course, as we're
<br>
still very far remote from high-resolution high-QoS streaming video.
