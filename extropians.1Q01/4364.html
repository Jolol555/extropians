Umbilical cords could repair brains 
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/532672.asp?0nm=T11O">http://www.msnbc.com/news/532672.asp?0nm=T11O</a>
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Umbilical cords discarded after birth may offer
<br>
a vast new source of repair material for fixing brains damaged by
<br>
strokes and other ills, free of the ethical concerns surrounding the
<br>
use of fetal tissue, researchers said Sunday. In animal experiments,
<br>
at least, cells from umbilical cords appear to greatly speed
<br>
recovery after strokes. They work with a simple infusion into the
<br>
blood stream without the need for direct implantation into the
<br>
brain. Although many details need to be worked out, Dr. Paul R.
<br>
Sanberg of the University of South Florida said he hopes to try the
<br>
approach on stroke victims within the next year or two. Many experts
<br>
believe that primitive tissue called stem cells will someday be
<br>
routinely used to make human spare parts. They might replace tissue
<br>
damaged by many different diseases, especially such brain ailments
<br>
as strokes and Alzheimer's disease. These generic cells can be
<br>
nudged to develop into all sorts of specialized tissue to repopulate
<br>
every part of the body from head to toe. One source of stem cells is
<br>
aborted fetuses or fertility clinics' discarded embryos. However,
<br>
this is especially contentious since anti-abortion groups oppose
<br>
fetal and embryonic stem cell research, and federally funded
<br>
scientists cannot use stem cells from these sources.
