</em><br>
<p><p>Culture = the integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior

that depends upon man's capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to
<br>
succeeding generations (Webster's 9th Collegiate Dictionary)
<br>
<p>I wonder if the communications-gap is a result of &quot;knowledge, belief, and
<br>
behavior&quot;--which we, as &quot;natural&quot; humans have the capacity to change--or if
<br>
it betrays a limitation of &quot;man's capacity for learning and transmitting
<br>
knowledge.&quot; Perhaps the typical human mind is only capable of operating
<br>
according to one view of reality. The only way to overcome such a limitation
<br>
would be to change the way the mind functions.
<br>
<p>In Damien's excerpt from THE ARCHITECTURE OF BABEL, he says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Still, surely the lay reader of literature (and even of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much criticism)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a grasp of its meaning which vanishes when faced with B-splines and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyclic coordinate descent-based algorithms.
</em><br>
<p>The lay reader of literature would likely understand most of the words,
<br>
true. But I'm not sure the average reader of literature comes away with any
<br>
clearer grasp of the writer's meaning than the average reader of a
<br>
scientific treatise.
<br>
<p>Could the average writer of literature do a better job of explaining what
<br>
she's written than Feynman could do with his theories? Probably so with
<br>
respect to an audience of lay people.
<br>
<p>I wonder whether this is because of a certain way the brain must function to
<br>
understand scientific concepts--and most people's brains don't function this
<br>
way regardless of training; or if it's because of the sort of training
<br>
scientists undergo.
<br>
<p>Greg Burch recently commented that most scientists are not good at
<br>
communicating. I wonder if this is because of the sort of training they've
<br>
had, or if it's because the ability of a brain to function &quot;scientifically&quot;
<br>
generally
<br>
precludes the ability to communicate well in the usual manner.
<br>
<p>It's interesting to observe the composition of Internet communities. I think
<br>
this one is one of the few in which people from opposite poles of the
<br>
science - poet spectrum are attempting to communicate seriously about ideas.
<br>
Other groups, such as The Well and Brainstorms, have members from opposite
<br>
poles, but they seem to mostly form sub-groups where they talk among their
<br>
own kind. I'd like to take a look at any other groups where people are
<br>
attempting to bridge the communications gap. Does anyone know of others?
