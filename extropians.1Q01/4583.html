Hi sir,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What have been you're experiences with poorly performing programmers?
</em><br>
<p>I've been the lead member of my universities ACM programming team for the
<br>
last two years.  Basically the team is chosen from the computer science
<br>
students at our university to compete against other universities.  I've been
<br>
involved very heavily in trying to pick a good team - it is difficult.
<br>
<p>There is only about 1 in 10 or less people in computer science that I would
<br>
want on the team.  Most programmers are pretty slow.  I find that it has to
<br>
do with something related to &quot;mathematical intelligence&quot; rather than
<br>
attitude.  Basically if someone can get A+ in math without trying to hard
<br>
then they are most likely a really good programmer if they want to be.  If
<br>
they are not good at math then they will not be able to think programming
<br>
problem through before they start - they will sort of do this weird
<br>
programming style where they start to code too soon and sort of try to
<br>
evolve their code towards a good solution.  This is much much slower and
<br>
produces much less efficient code.
<br>
<p>&quot;Mathematical intelligence&quot; seems to correspond pretty closely to IQ values.
<br>
Supposedly, professional mathematicians as a group usually have IQ's above
<br>
130.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What did you find helped increase the programmer's productivity?
</em><br>
<p>Find some way to boost the intelligence of your programmers.  It would be
<br>
the best way to do it.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
