Coming from Good Stock: Where Do Innovative Ventures Come From?
<br>
Research by Jesper B. Sorensen
<br>
Capital Ideas
<br>
Vol. 2, No. 2 Fall 1999
<br>
University of Chicago Graduate School of Business
<br>
<p>Some of the most radically innovative products and technologies
<br>
today are developed and commercialized not by existing companies,
<br>
but by entrepreneurial ventures. This is remarkable given the fact
<br>
that creating a new organization requires mobilizing a substantial
<br>
array of social and material resources. Innovative entrepreneurs
<br>
must not only overcome the skepticism that greets new, unproven
<br>
ideas, but must also conquer the reluctance of resource providers to
<br>
invest in ventures that have no track records. Understanding the
<br>
factors that shape the emergence of innovative ventures has
<br>
important policy implications. Where do innovative new ventures come
<br>
from?
<br>
<p>One answer to this question can be found in Silicon Valley lore,
<br>
which is filled with stories of young kids with bright ideas who
<br>
become mega-entrepreneurs. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded
<br>
Apple Computers in the garage of Jobs' parents' home. Bill Gates
<br>
dropped outof college to found a software company. Michael Dell
<br>
launched a computer company out of his dorm room in
<br>
college. Inspiring as these stories are,however, they obscure the
<br>
fact that most start-ups today are not foundedby college drop-outs,
<br>
but by people in the middle of their careers, often mid-level
<br>
managers, salesmen and engineers, who have spent many years working
<br>
for established firms.
<br>
<p>Intel Corporation was launched, not by a group of inexperienced
<br>
techies,but by a band of experienced engineers disaffected by
<br>
their work at Fairchild Semiconductor. Tivoli Systems, which
<br>
develops software, was founded bytwo former IBM engineers. Donna
<br>
Dubinsky capitalized on her successfulcareer with Apple Computer
<br>
and Claris Software to co-found Palm Computing,parent of the
<br>
first broadly successful handheld computer, the Palm Pilot.And
<br>
Kim Polese built on her career at Sun Microsystems to become CEO
<br>
ofMarimba, one of the most talked-about start-ups in Silicon
<br>
Valley.
<br>
<p>Recent researchfrom the University of Chicago Graduate School of
<br>
Business suggests thatthe characteristics of established firms
<br>
have important implications forthe dynamics of entrepreneurial
<br>
activity. In &quot;Coming From Good Stock:Career Histories and New
<br>
Venture Formation,&quot; professor Jesper B. Sorensen,together with
<br>
co-authors M. Diane Burton of Harvard Business School and
<br>
Christine Beckman of the University of California-Irvine, argue
<br>
that the experiences, information and credentials that
<br>
entrepreneurs accumulatewhile working for established firms play
<br>
a critical role in shaping the entrepreneurial
<br>
process. Specifically, the authors argue that entrepreneurs
<br>
receive crucial informational and reputational benefits from
<br>
having worked for employers that occupy prominent positions in
<br>
entrepreneurial networks.
<br>
<p>Entrepreneurial Hotbeds
<br>
<p>An important fact about established firms is that they differ in
<br>
the extent to which a firm is visible to those engaged in
<br>
entrepreneurial activity. One simple determinant of a firm's
<br>
visibility in an entrepreneurial context is the extent to which
<br>
it is a source of entrepreneurial ventures.Much as geographical
<br>
regions differ in their rates of entrepreneurial activity,
<br>
established firms differ markedly along this
<br>
dimension. Somefirms are entrepreneurial hotbeds, as perhaps
<br>
most famously exemplifiedby Fairchild Semiconductor, founded in
<br>
1957. Fairchild spawned ten new ventures in its first eight
<br>
years; moreover, most of the 31 semiconductor firms founded in
<br>
Silicon Valley in the 1960s could trace their lineage to
<br>
Fairchild. Examples of such &quot;Fairchildren&quot; include Intel,
<br>
Advanced Microdevices and LSI Logic. Other firms give rise to
<br>
relatively few, if any, new ventures. Today in Silicon Valley,
<br>
new ventures are particularly likely to trace their roots to
<br>
firms like IBM, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and National
<br>
Semiconductor.
<br>
<p>Sorensen and his collaborators argue that innovative new
<br>
ventures are more likely to emerge from established firms that
<br>
are entrepreneurially prominent. In part, this is due to
<br>
differences in the types of employees they attract. However, the
<br>
authors found that employer prominence affects entrepreneurial
<br>
behavior even after these differences are taken into account.
<br>
They offer two primary reasons.
<br>
<p>First, there are important informational and resource benefits
<br>
to being affiliated with a prominent firm. A central and
<br>
prominent position in an entrepreneurial network makes it
<br>
easier for a potential entrepreneur to scan the environment,
<br>
identify novel ideas, and explore new market possibilities. By
<br>
virtue of working for a firm that generates many start-ups,
<br>
employees of prominent firms are also more likely to have
<br>
personal contacts with members of the entrepreneurial
<br>
community. This helps facilitate access to ideas and resources.
<br>
<p>Second, Sorensen and his co-authors argue that substantial
<br>
reputational benefits accrue to employees of prominent
<br>
firms. Because the potential of innovative ventures is so highly
<br>
uncertain and difficult to assess, resource providers -- such as
<br>
venture capitalists -- look to more easily observable attributes
<br>
that are thought to be associated with the quality of the
<br>
venture, including the work histories of the founders. Knowing
<br>
that an entrepreneur has worked for a firm that in the past has
<br>
produced successful ventures may help reduce the perceived
<br>
uncertainty surrounding a venture. In this respect, potential
<br>
entrepreneurs at established firms benefit from the success of
<br>
those who preceded them.
