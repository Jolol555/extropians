Gosh.  The notion that total crime rate (or other social indicators) in a
<br>
city is a zero-sum game seems quite contrary to the evidence.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Given that education, housing, income level disparity, presence of jobs,
<br>
environmental factors in rearing, etc... can all affect the propensity
<br>
towards crime, it would seem that this is far from a zero-sum system.
<br>
There are real benefits to be had, for example, by ensuring a higher
<br>
quality education for residents of an area.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;From a purely economic standpoint, I suspect that the US incurs a huge cost
</em><br>
in *not* devoting more resources to education, particularly in the most
<br>
economically depressed and crime-ridden areas.

Of course, it seems that you are coming from the arguably absurd position
<br>
that &quot;bad&quot; areas don't need to exist.  Unfortunately, as long as riff-raff
<br>
exist, you'll have bad areas because creating  the &quot;good&quot; areas also tends
<br>
to create the &quot;bad&quot; ones.  It is pretty close to a zero-sum game no matter
<br>
how you organize the bodies in a free society (in a non-free society, you
<br>
have &quot;other&quot; choices for dealing with the problem).  Over the years, you
<br>
see these dynamics happen in any city; some formerly bad areas become
<br>
better, while formerly good areas become worse.  But I've never seen
<br>
anything resembling a free society where all the neighborhoods became
<br>
&quot;good&quot; without any areas becoming bad.  Riff-raff happen and they have to
<br>
live somewhere.
