<em>&gt; JR, This was ver informative!  I had a lot of difficulty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding your previous threads about &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;obsolete&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions.  But this paper was very good at explaining why some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-questions dissolve into meaninglessness as science discovers the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers.
</em><br>
<p>It delights me to learn that you like the Edge &quot;Questions That Have
<br>
Disappeared&quot; project. The authors/scientists who contributed have a way of
<br>
expressing ideas that evades me. I found out about this project from a
<br>
local radio talk show host who mentioned some of the questions. I e-mailed
<br>
him (Ken Murray) to ask for the URL of the pages he was quoting on the
<br>
air. Somewhat surprised to get a reply from him, I immediately went to the
<br>
indicated site, my old familiar edge.org, and there they were... all those
<br>
questions that have (or ought to have) disappeared. Life has its own way
<br>
of being sweet to me.
<br>

<p>--------------------
<br>
&quot;I'm interested in becoming a good god, stepping up to the challenge and
<br>
responsibility of godhood, without denying or trying to wiggle out of the
<br>
fact that we are as gods. If we would acknowledge our god-like powers --
<br>
making somethings out of nothings, birthing things that surprise us,
<br>
creating forces that will create themselves -- and not back away from
<br>
these talents, then I think we could learn to be responsible for them. If
<br>
we pretend we are mere modest humans, our unacknowledged powers will
<br>
undermine us.&quot; --Kevin Kelly
