<p><em>&gt; You might ask whether selfishness and competition plays a role in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our bodies.  Of course we are familiar with the ultimate selfishness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that occurs in a cancer when a cell reproduces excessively, but this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a harmful state.  Are there systems which rely on competition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work properly?
</em><br>
<p>I think parts of the immune system might be doing it, as different
<br>
antibodies both attack each other, forming weird epistatic networks of
<br>
mutual excitation and inhibition (which may or may not be important
<br>
for immune system memory - the jury is still out). There is also a
<br>
kind of competition between B cells about who gets to divide depending
<br>
on how well their antibodies fit an antigen.
<br>
<p>In the brain, there are a lot of competition between cell groups, as
<br>
they mutually inhibit each other but excite themselves. Hence a
<br>
stimulus will lead to a competition but bias it towards the group that
<br>
responds the most to the stimulus, making it win eventually. This
<br>
appears to occur in many parts of the cortex and basal ganglia, and
<br>
underlies things like perceptual rivalries and decision making. In the
<br>
spinal cord such competition appears to be part of central pattern
<br>
generators creating rhythmic motions like walking or swimming. In
<br>
addition, there is a bit of competition among synpases about being the
<br>
&quot;best&quot; synapse to activate the postsynaptic cell - the best will grow,
<br>
while less efficient synapses might disappear.
<br>
<p>Pattern formation is in general also a competitive process, as
<br>
different cells exude morphogens trying to influence their neighbors
<br>
to differentiate in one way or another or attract growing axons from
<br>
the nervous system. The structure of local blood vessel networks are
<br>
likely set by a competing process where different parts of tissue
<br>
demand oxygen and nutrient, and the parts that signal the loudest get
<br>
more capillaries. 
<br>
<p>Competition is everywhere in the body, it is just that the system is
<br>
tuned to make it produce beneficial results.
