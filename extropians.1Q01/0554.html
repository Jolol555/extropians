<p>The rapid increases in the capabilities of computers and their
<br>
associated communication systems are opening up wonderful new
<br>
opportunities for information technology to serve humanity, from
<br>
health care to entertainment to complex product design to
<br>
disaster prediction. The focus of this conference is current and
<br>
future ways in which high-performance computing can be used in
<br>
the support of commercial applications. The power of &quot;high-
<br>
performance&quot; computing continues to increase with time. High-
<br>
performance computing systems may be based on multiprocessor
<br>
systems, clusters or farms of machines, parallel computers,
<br>
special-purpose architectures, computational grids, distributed
<br>
computing, etc. The set of computers that comprise the system may
<br>
be heterogeneous or homogeneous. For this conference, a single
<br>
processor general purpose standard machine is not considered a
<br>
high-performance system. Our working definition of &quot;commercial
<br>
applications&quot; in the context of this conference is loosely
<br>
defined as applications that are of interest to the general
<br>
public and can be profitable for a company to undertake, as
<br>
opposed to one-of-a-kind applications whose development would be
<br>
funded by a federal government agency for its purposes only.
<br>
Furthermore, to be appropriate for this conference, these
<br>
applications must require the use of a high-performance computing
<br>
system, typically because of the computational complexity of the
<br>
task, extremely large data sets that must be processed, the need
<br>
for a response in relevant time, or some combination of these.
<br>
he parent symposium concerns the convergence of information
<br>
technology and communication technologies. The topics we expect
<br>
to cover in this conference will involve this convergence in one
<br>
or more of the following ways: (1) the computers that comprise
<br>
the high-performance system will be interconnected by high-speed
<br>
communications; (2) the application being executed is gathering
<br>
its inputs remotely over a communications network; or (3) the
<br>
high-performance system executing the application is remotely
<br>
accessed by its users through a communications network. Possible
<br>
general topics for current and future applications of interest
<br>
include, but are not limited to:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- aircraft design
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- airline industry reservation system
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- airline scheduling problem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- automobile design
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- bioinformatics and genomics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- business decision support
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- chemical process optimization
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- computational finance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- data mining and knowledge discovery
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- data visualization and animation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- drug discovery
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- e-business and e-commerce support
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- entertainment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- geophysical exploration (including oil)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- global climate modeling and prediction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- ground and air traffic control
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- image and speech understanding
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- integrated circuit chip design
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- mobility management for computing and communications
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- molecular engineering
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- multimedia support
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- natural disaster forecasting and mitigation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- satellite imaging
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- stock market modeling and prediction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- telemedicine and health care
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- virtual reality
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- web search engines
<br>

<br>
their full papers reviewed for this issue.
