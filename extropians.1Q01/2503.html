<p><em>&gt; &gt; Overall, I think the preprogrammed nature of the school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system as we have it (the concept is the same over there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as it is here) is a problem in itself. The basic premise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of education is that adults determine what kids should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; learn, and then these facts are rammed down children's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; throats. And kids who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?  If that is what education is then it would be a pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong-headed enterprise.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I was wrong to assume that US has it the same as we do over here.
<br>
Speaking for our country, the system is such that from age 7 to 19, you sit
<br>
in a classroom with 30 other kids 6-8 hours a day and endure the Chinese
<br>
torture that is listening or pretending to listen to the teacher. This can
<br>
be fun and exciting if the teacher is good and can motivate you, but too
<br>
many teachers (most of them) aren't good enough to be able to do that.
<br>
Hence, if your luck with teachers is bad enough, 13 years of boredom.
<br>
<p>After that, university is somewhat better, because you have more freedom in
<br>
choosing what you want to learn, and professors are a good deal better. But
<br>
even that is just my experience (physics, mathematics) - other faculties
<br>
(like economy) seem to be worse.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Education is about learning to think and learning information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathered by those who went before you,  at least enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue learning on your own as needed and desired.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not about &quot;cramming information&quot; down anyone's throat.
</em><br>
<p>Agree. That is what education should be about.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Kids don't know what they want to learn nor which basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills will enable them to learn it straight out of the womb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I agree that it is important to teach the joy of learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the practicalities of what are fundamental tools, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the average tyke is in a position to organize ver own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure. I think kids should at least be able to choose what they want
<br>
to learn at a specific time. According to my experience, learning is much
<br>
more effective if one learns a subject at the time when one is interested in
<br>
that subject. Conversely, when you try to force someone with geography when
<br>
they would be more interested in science experiments, they have a hard time
<br>
focusing, and they gain little from the session.
<br>
<p>I agree small kids aren't in a position to organize their education. But I
<br>
think they are in a position to choose what subjects to learn at what
<br>
times - with an adult supplying the options to choose from. I think this
<br>
applies at all times, not just after high school.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I think your assertion - &quot;such flexibility would lead...&quot; -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is largely irrelevant, because what is taught in schools is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably not what is &quot;right&quot;, it is what the majority wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kids to be taught. As in most human conflicts, the decisive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arguments here are arguments of force, not arguments of reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I utterly and totally disagree.  Teaching creation science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and foregoing the teaching of evolution is not undecidable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the basis of relative merit.  It is not just a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who exercises or can exercise the most force.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I should clarify this. My point was this: if creationists were in
<br>
charge of the country (mine or yours), schools would be teaching their
<br>
theories. But since 'we' (people like us) are currently in charge, schools
<br>
are teaching our theories.
<br>
<p>I am in no way inclined to teach kids creationist theories as an equivalent
<br>
alternative to what we learned from science. I assume people like me and you
<br>
feel similarly. As long as people like that are in charge, schools won't be
<br>
teaching creationist theories. I find that comforting - I wouldn't want to
<br>
live in a society that endorses creationist theories.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If the purpose of education is to teach what has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learned before then leaving evolution out of biology or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering it optional makes science education an utter sham.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it does. [That's not what some blokes think though.]
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If all that makes something right is MIGHT then it is a damn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorry world we live in.  Do you really want to make this claim?
</em><br>
<p>I'm just saying that the fact of who is in power is the fact that influences
<br>
most of everything else that happens. That's the way it is. Five centuries
<br>
ago, the Church was in power, and they did all sorts of stuff you and I find
<br>
disguisting. But that's the way it is. Fortunately for us, people who are
<br>
now in power share our point of view, to an extent.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Are all myths and scientific facts and theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally valid in your opinion?
</em><br>
<p>No, not by far.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Clearly they cannnot all simultaneously be true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in regard to the same aspects of what they purport to explain.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Why not simply teach the best of science in science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes and teach these other things in classes examining comparative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation myths?  In that class don't just teach the fundamentalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christian version but cover the entire spectrum of such.
</em><br>
<p>Hear, hear.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In the US I believe we have a fundamental clash brewing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between fundamentalism (more deeply, anti-intellectualism/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-reason) and science/reason.  It is not brewing only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here but its consequences will be the most far reaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US pressure cooker.  If we can't manage to act most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often on what can be verified by science/reason in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly educated and prosperous country then how will we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever reach the relatively undeveloped countries struggling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between ancient culture and modern knowledge and abilities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is no basis but the size of one's club for deciding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions then what hope of enough peace and plenty to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcend our current massive limitations is there? If reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot/does not prevail here then where will it?  If the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes the world's biggest theocracy then what would that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do to the world and all of our fondest dreams?
</em><br>
<p>True. I couldn't add anything to that.
