<em>&gt;From Brian Williams:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: &quot;Michael M. Butler&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:butler@comp-lib.org?Subject=Re:%20POL/PHIL:%20Crime%20and%20Punishment%20(was:%20Re:%20No%20Federal%20Parole)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101292027.MAA10787@shell16.ba.best.com&gt;">butler@comp-lib.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;No parole for any federal offenders for 16 years now and counting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ergo every federal prisoner, or near enough, would wind up there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It's easy to forget just how Procrustean the System already is...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or is that Draconian?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's wrong with people who commit crimes serving their full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the question here is this:  What is the purpose of prison,
<br>
anyway?  Most everyone who's been through a civis or government class
<br>
encouners this question at least at some level.  While I think we can 
<br>
all agree that prison is a deterrent to some level, the question comes
<br>
to be what is the main purpose of prison in any modern society, not just
<br>
that of the US:  Is prison supposed to be punitive, or is it supposed 
<br>
to be rehabilitative?  And can it possibly be both at the same time?
<br>
<p>I personally would argue that prison should be more a rehabilitative 
<br>
forum than a forum for punishment.  Rehabilitation, while initially
<br>
costlier, can often be much less expensive in the long run because of
<br>
decreased recidivism and increased productivity to society.  A form of
<br>
&quot;enforced welfare&quot; perhaps.
<br>
<p>Granted - the question of if prison should really exist at all or not 
<br>
is never seriously addressed.  What is the nature of crime and punishment 
<br>
in a situation where the locus of power is geared more towards the 
<br>
individual than any social structure?  On what foundation does the concept
<br>
of &quot;criminal justice&quot; lay?  Does any governmental instrument have either
<br>
the right or the responsibility to attempt to rehabilitate or punish 
<br>
individuals, and how would this idea scale into a more libertarian/econo-
<br>
anarchic model?
<br>
