Oh. I see. You meant the chances of some deep pockets starting up a
<br>
program to ship permanent inhabitants in a self-sustaining colony this
<br>
week, and pursuing it to completion, were a billion to one.
<br>
<p>Well. Duh.
<br>
<p>You must really think everyone on this list but you just fell off the
<br>
turnip truck on the way to their first science fiction convention.
<br>
<p>Sheesh. This is even shallower than the flamebaiting &quot;g&quot; threads. Start
<br>
with absurd assumptions, it's no effort at all to come to absurd
<br>
conclusions. Be my guest, but don't expect a huge following.
