Hey, the county fair where I grew up had &quot;city/farm of the future&quot;
<br>
dioramas and scale models with tiny cars that actually ran around
<br>
superhighways. Future stuff belongs at fairs, you betcha. Just try not
<br>
to frighten the horses. So to speak.
<br>
<p>Also might be profitable to study how the laRouchies and such operate
<br>
and do the best possible job of *not* coming off like them. I'm dead
<br>
serious here. Hmm. Not a very extro expression. I'm all the way live
<br>
serious here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not to mention the fact that many people will not sit for a dry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lecture and need to be shown that the future can be fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (end)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The artistic skills of people like Natasha could really make for an eye-catching booth.  We would need several of our best people to in a friendly and yet very intelligent way represent our beliefs.  It will be very possible that they will be running into well-meaning or not so well-meaning people who can debate our views rather well.  Yes, bright and educated folks do attend state fairs! lol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somehow I conceive of this booth as being something like a recruitment table set up by a college fraternity.  We would be looking for proto-extropians who would join up if they only knew about us.  Teenagers and college students would be a demographic we should definitely target if this idea is actually carried out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best wishes,
</em><br>
