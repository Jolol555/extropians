In a message dated 2/6/01 6:53:21 AM Pacific Standard Time, <a href="mailto:talon57@well.com?Subject=Re:%20We%20are%20all%20Africans%20(was%20Re:%20PDAs%20are%20searchable%20by%20cops)&In-Reply-To=&lt;69.10c672c5.27b17bff@aol.com&gt;">talon57@well.com</a> 
<br>
quotes: &lt;&lt; &gt;Most all of my black friends (or African Americans if you prefer) 
<br>
live with being pulled over quite often.  I think it even gets to the point 
<br>
where they feel that it's just something you have to deal with and they 
<br>
expect it.  One such friend was astonished when I told him I'd only ever been 
<br>
pulled over once.  He get's pulled over quite a lot, as does his parents, 
<br>
friends, etc. And these are all middle to upper class people.  They just 
<br>
happen to have the wrong skin color.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I don't wish to divert you from your theme but just to add something to the 
<br>
pot.  If you are white and don't believe there is such a thing as the cops 
<br>
picking on &quot;target&quot; groups start driving a pickup truck.  I have driven a 
<br>
pick up at times in my life but an auto much more often yet a good 80% of my 
<br>
stops have been while in the pick up.  Furthermore the nature of the stops 
<br>
are such that I have never received a payable ticket during one of those 
<br>
pickup stops.  Either no ticket was issued or it was nonsense and easily 
<br>
beaten.
