I am sure people get into fistfights with cops over their address books,
<br>
too. I'm not advocating giving oneself up, I am merely reporting what
<br>
has so far been held to be legal activity by cops regarding things
<br>
analogous to PDAs as they exist today.
<br>
<p>Integrate it with your pacemaker, &quot;organify&quot; it, and I would expect it's
<br>
a different deal. I already said as much.
<br>
<p>But today, in the US, once you are under arrest, police powers to search
<br>
you and separate you from your possessions goes way up. I can't speak
<br>
about other countries.
