</em><br>
<p>A point worth noting is the phrase &quot;faith-based creed&quot;: it can be
<br>
deceptive if used imprecisely. One of the things my recent reading
<br>
has brought home is that Islam, Judaism and Christianity, although
<br>
historically related, are *different* creeds -- substantially so, and
<br>
the manner in which they are expressed is significant.
<br>
<p>Judaism as currently practiced lacks the evangelical characteristics
<br>
of the other religions. It doesn't demand faith, it demands
<br>
self-identification and compliance with a complex code of laws and
<br>
commentaries extrapolated by generations of scholars. (Faith is a
<br>
useful thing to have when dealing with that little lot, of course.)
<br>
It also doesn't say much (or anything, really) about the afterlife:
<br>
it isn't some sort of theological life-belt thrown by a deity who wants
<br>
you to join him in the hereafter, it's a bunch of complex regulations
<br>
dumped on his Chosen People in order that they should, well, live the
<br>
way he wants them to. (There's no &quot;why&quot; in that, white boy: you'll shut
<br>
up and do as you're told!)
<br>
<p>Christianity tends to come with a lot of social and cultural baggage
<br>
-- especially the Roman and Orthodox churches -- and has evolved by
<br>
syncretism, mopping up a load of mithraistic traditions, converting a
<br>
lot of old Roman pagan deities into saints, and absorbing a chunk of
<br>
the cult of Isis. But the core message is an evangelical one: &quot;here's a
<br>
lifebelt! Pass it on!&quot; -- anyone can be saved if they put their faith
<br>
in Jesus. This message is so urgent that a lot of the superstructure
<br>
can be jettisoned and you've still got a core Christian belief system.
<br>
<p>Islam came third, and it looks like a hybrid. It's got the Jewish
<br>
legalistic approach and set of prescriptive lifestyle choices, but it
<br>
adds the heavenly afterlife lifebelt and the evangelical urge. It also
<br>
takes a &quot;them and us&quot; view of the world, dividing it up into muslims
<br>
(those who submit to the will of god) and pagans (the rest of us). There
<br>
are some elements that outsiders would characterise as nasty -- notably
<br>
the death penalty for apostasy -- but a lot of the things westerners
<br>
find objectionable or irritating (regulations over women's clothing,
<br>
for example: total prohibition of alcohol) are part of a superstructure
<br>
that grew up in its regional base; the original Koranic injunctions,
<br>
IIRC, are that both sexes should avoid dressing provocatively, and
<br>
that getting drunk isn't clever. One important point is that Islam
<br>
stresses the afterlife about as much as Christianity -- both religions
<br>
are good at handling martyrs. (Compare that to the rabbinical finding
<br>
that it is permissable to break any law except that against murder,
<br>
if it is necessary to do so to avoid being murdered. No bonus points
<br>
for martyrdom there!)
<br>
<p><p>What does this have to do with faith?
<br>
<p>Well, I seem to recall that, just as conventional left/right axes are
<br>
inadequate for graphing political views, some people have proposed a
<br>
multidimensional system for locating religions. I can't remember all the
<br>
bipolar axes, but they include evangelical/tribal, legalistic/informal,
<br>
and a couple of others. I'd like to dig this up (if I can) because it
<br>
suggests some interesting possibilities in assessing the potential of a
<br>
religious belief system for compatability with extropian ideas. It may
<br>
also explain why our preconceptions about
