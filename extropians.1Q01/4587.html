<em>&gt; Jim Fehlinger writes (quoting Kubrick):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a few millennia -- less than a microsecond in the chronology of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe -- can you imagine the evolutionary development that much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; species, which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; machine entities -- and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spirit. Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ungraspable by humans.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This echoes the descriptions in the novel of the evolutionary path of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creators of the monoliths.  I always assumed these words were written by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clarke; they drip with his style and conceptual outlook.  It's odd that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kubrick would quote them as his own, although of course it's possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this model was jointly conceived between him and Clarke.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the relevant passage in Clarke's novel is (Chapter 37, &quot;Experiment&quot;):
<br>
<p>&quot;Call it the Star Gate.  For three million years, it had circled
<br>
Saturn, waiting for a moment of destiny that might never come...
<br>
Now the long wait was ending.  On yet another world, intelligence
<br>
had been born and was escaping from its planetary cradle.  An
<br>
ancient experiment was about to reach its climax.  Those who had
<br>
begun that experiment, so long ago, had not been men -- or even
<br>
remotely human.  But they were flesh and blood...  And now, out among
<br>
the stars,... [t]he first explorers of Earth had long since come to
<br>
the limits of flesh and blood; as soon as their machines were better than
<br>
their bodies, it was time to move.  First their brains, and then their thoughts
<br>
alone, they transferred into shining new homes of metal and plastic...
<br>
But the age of the Machine-entities swiftly passed.  In their
<br>
ceaseless experimenting, they had learned to store knowledge in
<br>
the structure of space itself, and to preserve their thoughts
<br>
for eternity in frozen lattices of light.  They could become creatures
<br>
of radiation, free at last from the tyranny of matter.  Into pure
<br>
energy, therefore, they presently transformed themselves...
<br>
Now they were lords of the galaxy, and beyond the reach of time...
<br>
But despite their godlike powers, they had not wholly forgotten
<br>
their origin, in the warm slime of a vanished sea.  And they
<br>
still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started,
<br>
so long ago.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;beings of pure energy and spirit&quot; ...oh, yeah, they talk about that kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thing on the Art Bell radio show... along with &quot;white powder of gold&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...an equally ridiculous notion.
</em><br>
<p>I always thought this was a perfectly respectable, if no longer particularly
<br>
fresh, sci-fi trope.  Cf., for example, Isaac Asimov's 1965 short story
<br>
&quot;Eyes Do More Than See&quot;.  Or any number of TV shows, even.  For
<br>
example, the old _Outer Limits_ episode, &quot;The Sixth Finger&quot; (1963):
<br>
<p>GWILYM GRIFFITHS:  ...I could feel myself reaching that stage in the
<br>
dim future of mankind when the mind will cast off the hamperings of
<br>
the flesh, and become all thought and no matter.  A vortex of pure
<br>
intelligence in space.  It is the goal of evolution:  Man's final
<br>
destiny is to become what he imagined in the beginning, when he
<br>
first learned the idea of the angels.
<br>
<p>Teilhard de Chardin, via Ellis St. Joseph and Joseph Stefano.
<br>
<p>Or the original _Star Trek_ episode &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot;.
<br>
<p>A more recent, and very hard-science, variation on this theme
<br>
is Gregory Benford's _Eater_:
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380974363/qid=982961089/sr=1-10/ref=sc_b_10/105-1983891-4461568">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380974363/qid=982961089/sr=1-10/ref=sc_b_10/105-1983891-4461568</a> ,
<br>
which features an extraterrestrial intelligence encoded in the
<br>
magnetic flux lines generated by a plasma surrounding a black hole.
