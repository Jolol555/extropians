</em><br>
<p>I didn't say friendly, I said Friendly.  A Friendly AI is not an AI with
<br>
anthropomorphic friendship instincts copied from humans; a Friendly AI is
<br>
one that exhibits Friendly behavior, from whatever source derived. 
<br>
Dependence upon humans is certainly not a reliable source except for
<br>
human-equivalent AIs operating in the human social context, and frankly I
<br>
wouldn't trust it there either.  Obviously, a Friendship system that makes
<br>
Friendliness conditional upon dependence or even reciprocal altruism is
<br>
not well-designed, though there are (sigh) some AIfolk who still seem to
<br>
be stuck on that point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I present the following scenario: AI programmed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly and oversee humanity, exterminating pesky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggressors. Something goes wrong with AI. Humans try
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this as aggression (after all, why would we want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm Mr. Friendly..?), and so on...
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a pretty stupid AI to me.  One incapable of understanding
<br>
humans, or for that matter, its own mission.  We aren't talking about an
<br>
insect armed with nuclear weapons and a six-line definition of
<br>
&quot;aggression&quot;; we're talking about a superintelligence who started life as
<br>
a seed AI that spent months if not years chatting about Friendliness with
<br>
the programmers, including the part where Friendly behavior should not be
<br>
conditional upon the way humans behave toward the AI, and the part where
<br>
you don't destroy the village in order to save it.
<br>
<p>I mean, really, this is such an obviously unFriendly scenario that it's a
<br>
science-fictional cliche and the first thing you thought of; d'you really
<br>
think a transhuman AI won't be able to understand that this ain't
<br>
Friendliness?
