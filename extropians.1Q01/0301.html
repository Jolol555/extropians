<em>&gt; 	at 1 g, the velocity gets relativistic pretty fast. if my math
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hasn't failed me, by the time the craft is halfway to mars, it'd be doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 0.4 c -- decelerating at 1 g as well, it will get from earth to mars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a little less than 3 days.
</em><br>
<p>This is not quite right.  Earth-Mars distance is about 60 million miles
<br>
at closest approach.  1 g is 32 ft/sec^2, or .006 mi/sec^2.  1/2 a t^2
<br>
for 30 million miles is about 100,000 seconds or 27.6 hours to turnaround
<br>
point, for a total of 2 days, 7 hours (so you were right about the time
<br>
estimate).
<br>
<p>However the velocity will be a*t, or .006 * 100,000 which is about 600
<br>
miles per second, far from the speed of light which is 186,000 mps.
<br>
<p>(Apologies for all the English units but for an old fashioned guy like
<br>
me it is more intuitive.)
<br>
<p>There is an interesting way to see that the speed estimate has to
<br>
be wrong.  In relatively theory we sometimes use &quot;geometrical units&quot;,
<br>
which sets the speed of light c to be the dimensionless quantity 1.
<br>
In these units, speeds are dimensionless fractions, and therefore time
<br>
and space have the same units.  A light-year is the same as a year,
<br>
in this system.  (You can also bring mass into the system by treating
<br>
a given mass as equivalent to the size of the black hole it would form.)
<br>
<p>In dimensionless units, 1 g is 9.8 m/s^2 * (1 s / 3E8 m) or about one 30
<br>
millionth per second, or about one per year.  In the simple approximation
<br>
v = a * t so given that g is 1/year it will take about a year at that
<br>
accelration to reach a speed of approximately 1, which is the speed
<br>
of light.
<br>
<p>So if you know that Earth's gravitational acceleration is about 1/year
<br>
in these units (easy to remember) you know right away that you won't
<br>
be close to the speed of light after only a day or two of acceleration,
<br>
which is how I know that the speed figure was wrong.
<br>
<p>BTW the fact that Earth's gravitational acceleration is approximately
<br>
equal to its orbital period is pure coincidence AFAIK and is not true
<br>
of any of the other planets, probably.
