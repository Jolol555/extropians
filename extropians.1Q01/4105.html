<p>Thats what I am, Ben, an isolated indecent.  {8^D
<br>
<p>Sorry, that typo was too funny to not point out.  But
<br>
speaking of isolated indecents, our old pal Bill Joy is
<br>
at it again.  he had a page and a half story in the San
<br>
Jose Merc today, reiterating and expanding on stuff
<br>
he said in the Wired article.
<br>
<p>This time he went ahead and said that if a child is
<br>
dying with a genetic disease, it is better to let that
<br>
child perish than risk humanity's future by manipulating
<br>
the genes.
<br>
<p>He stated further that freedom of speech in some
<br>
cases should be restricted.  Quotes from the merc:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps science should stop manipulating genes, he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;suggested, even if new gene therapies might save a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;child from incurable cancer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, we dont have t fix it,&quot; said Joy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He's said it before, he continued, and &quot;people have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;left the room&quot; over his suggestion &quot;that I could imagine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;letting someone suffer to protect the group.&quot;
<br>
<p>{Elsewhere in the article}:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it is no exaggeration to say we are on the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil.&quot;
<br>
<p>{Perhaps he was referring to the release of windoze 2000?
<br>
Elsewhere}:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Zalman said, 'Maybe we should declare that nanotechnology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;isn't kosher, and maybe the pope should declare it a mortal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sin,&quot; Joy said, &quot;I said, 'Thats an interesting perspective.  Most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the people in my company dont think that way.'&quot;
<br>
<p>{Imagine that.  Perhaps we should declare the pope a mortal
<br>
sin.  Elsewhere}:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...most controversially, set limits on free speech to stop the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;spread of dangerous technological knowledge.  Not all information,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not all computer coding, should be shared with just anyone anymore,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he said.&quot;
<br>
<p>OK, Bill Joy takes on the first amendment.  Clearly if the Ludites
<br>
are given enough rope, they will hang themselves.  spike
