<em>&gt; You could frame this in the same way as any risky behavior:  It is

<em>&gt; reasonable to expect in any activity that one has tacitly accepted the

</em><br>
<p>In theory, and from our standpoint, yes. In practice, I seem to remember
<br>
that there are a *lot* of psychology studies out there that show that most
<br>
human beings find it difficult to reason effectively about probabilities,
<br>
and particularly probabilities of negative outcomes. More people buy a 
<br>
lottery ticket hoping to win than buy one expecting to lose, to put it
<br>
another way. I'd say that most people who rob banks do so because they
<br>
fail to effectively assess the risks attached to their actions. (Those who
<br>
adequately understand the risks simply don't do that.)
<br>
<p>Therefore it's highly likely that a majority of bank robbers don't
<br>
understand that they can wind up dead as a result of their actions -- or
<br>
fail to generalise from other bank robbers' situations to their own. (Lots
<br>
and lots of criminals out there are sitting in prison complaining that
<br>
they're plenty smart, it's just that they had a bit of bad luck. Rather
<br>
than realising that they're _not_ smarter than the rest of society,
<br>
and they manufactured their own bad luck.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a bank robber had the ability to dictate outcomes, he certainly wouldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to rob a bank for cash.
</em><br>
<p>This is true ...
