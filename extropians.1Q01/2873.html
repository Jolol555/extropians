<p>
To ground this discussion somewhat, we should recognize that there are
<br>
limits to what even nanotech can accomplish.
<br>
<p>The magical build-anything genii machine is a highly advanced nanotech
<br>
device.  Before that we will see machines that can build a wide variety
<br>
of things when given the proper raw materials.  I imagine there will be
<br>
specialized factories that produce these raw materials in the form needed
<br>
by the assemblers, possibly using ordinary bulk chemical processing.
<br>
This more limited form of nanotech, while it will hopefully greatly
<br>
reduce the cost of manufactured products, will not necessarily make it
<br>
possible for every person in the third world to be rich.
<br>
<p>Even once we have a genii machine that can work with dirt or even rock,
<br>
you still obviously need sources of dirt and rocks.  If land becomes
<br>
the ultimate resource it may become highly valuable, and peasants may
<br>
not be able to afford land.
<br>
<p>And there are still constraints imposed by energy limits.  The genii
<br>
machine can be powered by solar energy, but solar collectors will need
<br>
to be large in order to allow for substantial manufacturing effort, which
<br>
again means you need a lot of land.  And besides collecting energy, there
<br>
is the problem of disposing of it.  Last year Robert Bradbury described
<br>
some calculations of Robert Freitas which indicated that seemingly modest
<br>
levels of nanotech manufacturing, if carried on by every person on earth,
<br>
could upset the heat balance of the entire planet.
<br>
<p>Even in a world with genii machines, there will probably be great
<br>
differences in wealth, which means that there will still be ways to
<br>
transfer wealth and to hire people.  The human struggle will not end,
<br>
though the rising tide has lifted all our boats to levels beyond our
<br>
present dreams.  We will still face problems of envy and jealousy and
<br>
desire; there will still be violence and theft.  The poor peasants on
<br>
their homesteads must be able to defend their property if they wish to
<br>
keep it, and that won't be easy if those who want to take it away are
<br>
vastly more wealthy and powerful.
<br>
<p>For these reasons and others, it is probably not realistic to imagine
<br>
that nanotech will automatically create abundance for all.  Undoubtedly
<br>
it will create great wealth, but the question of how that wealth ends
<br>
up being distributed will depend on how political and economic factors
<br>
play out over the next decades.
