I wouldn't take this as a reflection on the procedure itself. Dunno 
<br>
if you've ever seen this guy, but he's a flake, a con, and (I 
<br>
believe) an ex-con. It was like he was TRYING to screw himself (and 
<br>
&quot;his&quot; hand) up...

<em>&gt; THE world's first hand-transplant patient has had his new hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amputated after his body began to reject it, writes Adam NathanAdam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nathan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The operation was carried out in London on Clint Hallam, a New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zealander, after he had pleaded to have it removed. Earl Owen, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australian microsurgeon who co-led the international team that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performed the revolutionary operation to attach the hand in France in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1998, said Hallam had failed to look after it properly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;He went without drugs for weeks at a time and failed to follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment plan,&quot; said Owen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hallam had come to loathe his &quot;dead man's hand&quot;, saying he had no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling in it. He also had problems meeting the £10,000 yearly drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nadey Hakim, a surgeon at St Mary's Hospital, London, carried out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amputation on Friday evening in a private hospital. Hakim said the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation was necessary because for two months Hallam had not been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking the medication prescribed as part of the anti-rejection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment. &quot;His life was in danger,&quot; he said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hallam, 50, who lost his hand in a circular saw accident in 1984, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected to be able to leave hospital tomorrow. He had declared that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his body and mind had said &quot;enough is enough&quot; and the hand should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amputated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hallam said for the first year, the right hand - which had belonged to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a French motorcyclist killed in an accident - had functioned well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there had been constant &quot;pockets of rejection&quot;. He denied this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sparked by failure to take medication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Previously he had talked of being &quot;mentally detached&quot; from the hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which was larger than his own.
