<em>&gt; &gt;I was referring to the population of the world when I said most

<em>&gt; &gt;people spend the majority of their time doing things they don't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to be doing.  I've never been to China or India, but I've known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people from both places. From what they tell me and from what I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;read, it seems that the majority of the people there spend more time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;working than people in the US and most of the work is pretty tiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and definitely not what you'd call fun or uplifting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't completely trust people who live in a country to give you an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective opinion.  I spent several months working in India about 6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years back, and I have a completely opposite opinion of the work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethic there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During my time in Hyderabad (large city toward the center of India),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had a chance to observe a number of different classes of people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their day-to-day lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My fellow Americans and I were absolutely astounded at the milling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around going on.  You'd see large groups of the same men standing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around for hours during the day.  At first, I thought the men
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing outside my window on the side of the road were waiting for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bus or something, but soon, it became apparent that these guys were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just hanging out shooting the breeze.  This was day after day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere we went.  I'm not talking about one or two guys hanging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out on an isolated corner, I'm talking about clumps of dozens all up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and down the roads.
</em><br>
<p>Are you sure these guys had jobs? Or homes for that matter?  The
<br>
unemployed will often be seen even in Western countries passing time
<br>
with one another.  
<br>
<p>Now, on the other hand I have been told by Indian friends that things
<br>
are strange at the University level.  There is pretty strong competition
<br>
to get in but once in it is almost impossible to flunk out. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The engineers in our office were better, although I was a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised at the lack of drive and enthusiasm.  We were a successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American startup with Indian ownership, so we had good funding and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots of &quot;connections&quot; to locals who could find good people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment, etc.  We had lots of modern workstations, tons of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documentation, a good Internet connection, and we let our engineers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that we were more than willing to allow them after-hours and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weekend use of the computers for their own projects.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universities that these guys attended had old crappy computers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could only get access to for a couple of hours a week.  We were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offering them a technological playground, and making ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to teach them anything they wanted to learn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They couldn't have cared less.  For the most part, they came in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked their hours, then went home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That has not been my experience with the people from India that come to
<br>
the US generally.  Actually it is mixed as you would expect.  Some
<br>
people want to
<br>
&quot;do their time&quot; and leave much like many US natives.  Others are the
<br>
among the most dedicated and tenacious learners and engineers I have
<br>
ever worked with.  But perhaps being different in that way is strongly
<br>
correlated with choosing to come to the US?
<br>
<p>I can believe that generations of poverty plus generations of foreign
<br>
rule have bred in a bit of a dearth of ambition.  Plus religions that
<br>
teach this world is maya do not help.
