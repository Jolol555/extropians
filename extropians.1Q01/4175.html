<p><em>&gt;    Let me put up something for your consideration and speculation.  I have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  always heard that scientists and engineers can't write.  As an engineer 
</em><br>
that 
<br>
<em>&gt;  comment pinched.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      However when I took an obligatory course in law I noticed that Supreme 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Court Justices and Engineers use basically the same style and use it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the same purpose -- to explain their decisions and how they arrived at 
</em><br>
them.
<br>
<em>&gt;      Now, I wonder if there is anything wrong with the writing style or 
</em><br>
just 
<br>
<em>&gt;  that it is one most folks don't run into.
</em><br>
<p>Very apt observation.  Legal writing is TECHNICAL writing and has some rigid 
<br>
functional goals and constraints if it is to do it's job: You have to clearly 
<br>
set out the factual and legal bases for the argument or decision you want to 
<br>
convey and get to the point of your argument or analysis as clearly and 
<br>
quickly as you can.  This is so for two reasons.  First, persuasive 
<br>
communication &quot;shows it's bones&quot; in terms of structure and function and, 
<br>
second, the readers of legal writing are uniformly overtaxed in terms of time 
<br>
and energy for consumption of information.
<br>
<p>When I teach legal writing I have to first assess the student's writing 
<br>
background.  Students coming from a technical background usually present 
<br>
little challenge in teaching this as a first stage of mastering the skills 
<br>
required of an effective legal communicator.  The challenge comes in the 
<br>
second stage, which is putting LIFE back into the end product to increase its 
<br>
impact as a tool of persuasion (and even judicial writing -- as opposed to 
<br>
the writing of the advocate -- should be a matter of persuasion, a thing 
<br>
understood by few judges), but VERY carefully and economically.  People who 
<br>
come from a background in literature and other areas of the humanities need 
<br>
much more coaxing to get them to strip their legal writing down to the bare 
<br>
essentials before they get to the &quot;icing on the cake&quot;, which is the 
<br>
&quot;decoration&quot; of the basic structure with rhetorical flourishes.
