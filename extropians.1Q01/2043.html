</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps I should just try to explain - on a completely personal note,

<em>&gt; without the desire to settle any argument - what I meant when I said that I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans I've met were more open, more outgoing, more fun to be with than,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know, Germans. I love that about your country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I dislike is the seriousness with which your government approaches its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens. You walk up into a government institution, and the police officers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in there walk around with shotguns, and the sign says something like &quot;It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a federal crime to attack a police officer&quot; (don't remember the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words). Drive too fast, and they put you in jail. And so on.
</em><br>
<p>This is a phenomenon of the last 10 years in most places (though its
<br>
been around longer in places like NY, DC, and Chicago). Because the
<br>
socialist orientation of much of our government since the Johnson
<br>
administration has consistently taken a stance of not trusting people to
<br>
be free, those they treat the most that way tend to act the most
<br>
irresponsible, so those who come in contact with them the most treat
<br>
everyone who is not one of them as 'the enemy'. Its a bunker mentality
<br>
that perpetuates the vicious cycle of mistrust that the left feeds off
<br>
of. Our nation has been an extremely tough nut for the socialists to
<br>
crack because we have traditionally been so free, and many of us resist
<br>
being enslaved. As a result, our crime rates and police malpractice of
<br>
symptoms of the low level conflict that is going on still in our culture
<br>
between classical liberals (and their allies) and socialist liberals
<br>
(and their allies). You'll notice that crime has been on the wane, back
<br>
toward rates that pre-existed the 'Great Society' experiment, ever since
<br>
the GOP took control of congress in 1994 and has been dismantling the
<br>
welfare state. The left knows it has suffered a rout, and is now back to
<br>
the early conflict level of staging riots and demonstrations, as it did
<br>
in the 60's. They remain a force in academia and among the teachers of
<br>
our children, in control of labor unions and propaganda bookstores.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I am talking about pretty much resembles what you and other posters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned as one of the primary justifications to posess firearms. That may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be true, you are the sole judge of that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I was trying to use the same argument the other way around: I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is possibility that attitude of the citizens reinforces the attitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the government. Which in turn reinforces the attitude of the citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Until there's a civil war...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this &quot;reinforcement theory&quot; is true, then your country has already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drifted way past its European siblings, and is approaching something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China. But as said, I cannot defend this on objective grounds. So take it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pure speculation.
</em><br>
<p>We do risk such a transition, but I don't think the risk will remain for
<br>
more than another two years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is pretty weak.  Do you really think there is a direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strong cause and effect between having no right ot have guns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and improved quality of life?  On what basis?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are two cases to look at, and you're looking at the other one. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are talking about denying an individual the right to have a gun, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact on the individual's quality of right is negative. Taking away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's rights from the outside is a Bad Thing. I believe in that as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the perspective is totally different if everyone decides that, &quot;OK, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want any of this dangerous stuff in our sight, let's get rid of it -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and let's make sure the bad guys can't get it, either.&quot; The total absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guns in a society *does* improve the quality of life of every participating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indivudual - you can't be shot if there are no guns.
</em><br>
<p>However, you are forgetting that government still has guns. You are not
<br>
getting rid of guns, you are merely agreeing to surrender the individual
<br>
participation in the market of political power and force, and institute
<br>
a fully monopolized control by the government that is self regulating.
<br>
Unless you can institute anti-trust actions in an independent court
<br>
system against that monopoly, you are no longer free. You just think you
<br>
still are, and the government tells you you still are, but you are not.
<br>
It is a popular fiction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In a choice of life or death, who wins matters a lot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eh - win win, lose lose. Whenever there is a conflict, both sides lose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no way to win a conflict. In the overall scheme of things, long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness might matter a little bit. Short term conflicts, and their short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term results, matter not. I am sure life after death is just as nice as life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before death. No need to worry too much about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;/personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is more left wing relativist claptrap, which has projected the
<br>
lose-lose strategy of nuclear war into all forms of conflict. This is
<br>
standard propaganda programming at its finest. Sun Tsu says that defeat
<br>
is an event that occurs in the mind of the enemy. You are already
<br>
defeated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In a choice of being free or enslaved or easy to enslave,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it matters a lot where one is on the spectrum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See above. [But do note that what I'm saying is just my personal philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's quite extreme, and it does not necessarily have to be yours. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would probably disagree with me. I let them disagree, no problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.]
</em><br>
<p>Then don't pass your claptrap off as if it is commonly accepted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I have a fundamental right to self-defense then how is a majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; denying that right any more acceptable than a minority?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you don't have a fundamental right to anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People think they have fundamental rights, and they think some things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally wrong. But that isn't true. Things are the way they are. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only thing you really do have is your freedom to do anything that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict with the laws of physics. That is fundamental, that is universal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other than that, nothing else is fundamental or universal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religions and governments that say otherwise are manipulating with people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their manipulations may have good intentions, but they are nevertheless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hence, your &quot;fundamental rights&quot; translate to what society lets you. Society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be changed, and what you perceive as your &quot;fundamental rights&quot; changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;/personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so you have no agreement with the concept of natural rights. That
<br>
explains much. You are, however, wrong.
