<p>Any company that can demonstrate the infrastructure to reach to Mars,
<br>
when even large governments can not, would likely be able to set its
<br>
own rates for access to this new land - for explorers and terraformers
<br>
alike.  (&quot;You wanna get away from it all, and literally build a new
<br>
home for humanity?  Or maybe just flee from [random_large_government]
<br>
because of its [random_oppresive_acts]?  We can do it - but you're ours
<br>
while you're up there.  We own and operate the life support systems,
<br>
and the info pipelines to anyone you'd like to keep in touch with back
<br>
here.  Which means you're working for us - either terraforming, or
<br>
doing science missions, or a few other things that can be done better
<br>
there than here, or simply creating intellectual property for us to
<br>
sell back on Earth.  We'll try to be benevolent dictators since a slave
<br>
revolt is the only thing we really fear from you, but someone's gotta
<br>
earn the food shipments and pay off our stockholders until you guys get
<br>
self-sustaining.  We've already made arrangements for security: since
<br>
the governments of Earth couldn't be bothered to go there, the weapons
<br>
we've built there are for our use only, to shoot down any
<br>
competitors...or to harrass anyone who makes a big enough stink about
<br>
it on Earth, possibly trying to interfere with our Earth-side
<br>
operations.&quot;)
<br>
<p>...or maybe I'm being too pessimistic here.
