I suggest to you that the entire effort to create and
<br>
empower a nanny AI can end ONLY in disaster. The thing
<br>
will have no allegiance to us, no dependence on
<br>
us--will no more &quot;relate&quot; to us than we do to insects
<br>
or, perhaps more appropriately, to the descendants of
<br>
those  more primitive life-forms from which many
<br>
believe we have evolved.
<br>
<p>Tell me--when you turn on the hot-water faucet, do you
<br>
think about the bacteria in the drain being scalded to
<br>
death?

<em>&gt; &gt; Well I do confess to a perhaps inordinate fondness

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; James Cameron epics--but &quot;friendly&quot; is of course a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human concept which, arguably, is not

<em>&gt; logic-based--or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wouldn't be for an entity not dependent upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for its own well-being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say friendly, I said Friendly.  A Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI is not an AI with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropomorphic friendship instincts copied from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans; a Friendly AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that exhibits Friendly behavior, from whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source derived. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dependence upon humans is certainly not a reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source except for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-equivalent AIs operating in the human social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context, and frankly I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't trust it there either.  Obviously, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendship system that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness conditional upon dependence or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reciprocal altruism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not well-designed, though there are (sigh) some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIfolk who still seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be stuck on that point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I present the following scenario: AI programmed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; friendly and oversee humanity, exterminating pesky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aggressors. Something goes wrong with AI. Humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to shut it down to avoid catastrophe. AI perceives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this as aggression (after all, why would we want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; harm Mr. Friendly..?), and so on...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds like a pretty stupid AI to me.  One incapable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, or for that matter, its own mission.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't talking about an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insect armed with nuclear weapons and a six-line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;aggression&quot;; we're talking about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence who started life as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a seed AI that spent months if not years chatting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Friendliness with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the programmers, including the part where Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditional upon the way humans behave toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI, and the part where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't destroy the village in order to save it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, really, this is such an obviously unFriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario that it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science-fictional cliche and the first thing you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought of; d'you really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think a transhuman AI won't be able to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this ain't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness?
