</em><br>
<p>Conflicts matter greatly to those embroiled in them. If someone comes up to 
<br>
you and demands your wife, life, child, or money, what do you do? Even in 
<br>
the most &quot;advanced&quot; societies there are sociopaths who will provide the 
<br>
conflicts you don't want to consider.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think your attitude is the original reason why you have a police you need

</em><br>
<p>We were not always &quot;afraid&quot; of our police.
<br>
<p>Police powers here have grown steadily in the same proportion that laws 
<br>
limiting freedom have been passed. 100 years ago, there were one or two 
<br>
peace officers in a normal small town, and they provided services such as 
<br>
rattling the door knobs on businesses at night, and breaking up fights.
<br>
<p>With the advent of motor vehicles, we also added a new class of police - 
<br>
traffic cops. These police do not interact with the people except when they 
<br>
stop someone for violation of any of thousands of petty laws. True, they do 
<br>
sometimes remove actively dangerous drivers from the roads, but by and 
<br>
large they are a highly visible threat to the everyday driver.
<br>
<p>Our legislatures have required these police to enforce ever more strict and 
<br>
picayune regulations. Some of the officers hired have attitude problems and 
<br>
see all of the public as potential criminals. Because of these factors, the 
<br>
public by and large now fears the police, rather than respects them.
<br>
<p>My father was a Chicago cop from the late 1930's until 1964. He walked a 
<br>
beat and was well known in his assigned neighborhood. If he found a 
<br>
youngster getting into trouble, most likely he would take the miscreant 
<br>
home to his parents rather than jail the kid.
<br>
<p>By the time he retired, &quot;beat cops&quot; had been replaced with squad cars. 
<br>
There was little interaction between the police and the public.
<br>
<p>The race and &quot;peace&quot; riots of the 1960's turned the public's admiration to 
<br>
the police largely to distrust, if not outright disgust. Recent federal 
<br>
police actions such as Ruby Ridge and Waco have done the same for the BATF 
<br>
and FBI.
<br>
<p>Guns are not the reason we fear our cops today. We fear what they have, and 
<br>
are, becoming, and those same guns now become ever more important to our 
<br>
remaining a free society.
