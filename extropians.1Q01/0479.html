[Non-member submission]
<br>
<p>I was simply pointing out that you could only tie the word extremism to a
<br>
set of ideologies relative to some other concept. I don't think it
<br>
cognitively efficient to use the word, meaning it doesn't add any useful
<br>
information to what's being said (other then the fact that the person using
<br>
the word thinks that what is being described is radically different from
<br>
&quot;their&quot; ideas). This was my point in interrupting the thread that was going
<br>
on. It's not a valid word. Sure you can say it, but what do you really mean
<br>
by using it? What your really saying is that an idea differs from your view,
<br>
or the popular view, or some other idea. It's a concept that implies a
<br>
range, but leaves out content, which is not a proper thing to do with
<br>
discussing ideas. How can you leave the content of a concept out and only
<br>
deal with its degree? That might matter for the purpose of comparing ideas,
<br>
but it has NOTHING to do with the truth of the idea. I for one cant find a
<br>
reason to keep this anti-word in our language. If someone can spot a real
<br>
use for this concept, please let me know.
<br>
<p>Extremism cannot be separated from a particular cause; there is no such
<br>
thing as extremism in general, so appeals to extremist generalities, such as
<br>
liberty, health, honesty, etc. have no force; of COURSE everyone is for
<br>
freedom, health and honesty, and NO one is for slavery, illness and
<br>
duplicity.  Extremism manifests when it is tied to the end of a position
<br>
spectrum in which people also populate the middle and even the other extreme
<br>
as well; the two most common extremisms in the US, as Aaron Lynch pointed
<br>
out in his memetic treatise THOUGHT CONTAGION, are the radical anti-abortion
<br>
and contraception and three-full-trimester pro-choice extremists, and the
<br>
ban-all-guns-whatsoever-anti-gun-nuts and
<br>
give-kids-criminals-and-crazies-tommy-guns-pro-gun-nuts; when these two
<br>
cross-fertilize, we have such logical atrocities as pro-life murders and
<br>
pressure to deny picketers free-speech rights even when they are not
<br>
harassing clients or orchestrating clinic invasions.  Each swears by their
<br>
own camp's statistics, and equally swears that the opposing camps'
<br>
statistics are propagandistic lies, or that the wrong lesson is being drawn
<br>
from them.  Neither extreme can admit to themselves that they actually ARE
<br>
extremists, so they portray the vast majority of the people who are
<br>
middle-of-the-roaders as either deceived and ignorant dupes or malevolent
<br>
and lying shills, or sometimes, illogical as it may sound, both at once,
<br>
especially when a pack of extremists is attacking someone who is not
<br>
extreme.  Even when they acknowledge that they are not in the present
<br>
majority, each extreme will steadfastly maintain that they are the wave of
<br>
the future, and that when people become more intelligent or enlightened or
<br>
informed, they will flock to their side in droves.  Though hesitant to admit
<br>
it, they generally find more in common with their doppelganger on the
<br>
opposite side of their pet issue (as both extremes are ruled by their issues
<br>
and obsessively and compulsively tend them, as people can be with their
<br>
pets) than with the apathetic and indifferent 'sheeple' who really don't
<br>
care that much one way or another.  The best way to know when an extremist
<br>
is about to attack is to listen to them get indignantly defensive, which
<br>
typically happens whenever someone does not absolutely agree with them
<br>
concerning their pet issue; some sort of physical intimidation or verbal
<br>
flame is sure to follow.
