Ivo maintains an interesting website at <a href="http://www.balkansnet.org">http://www.balkansnet.org</a>, which is
<br>
how I found him. I enjoy the way he communicates his views of the world, and
<br>
I thought some of you might enjoy that too. If you browse through
<br>
www.balkansnet.org, you will find more writing like this. Be sure to click
<br>
in unlikely places though. [For instance, the &quot;Ivo's rants&quot; icon with the
<br>
man banging away at the keyboard at the bottom of the page]
<br>
<p>According to my scarce knowledge, Ivo used to be a journalist in Yugoslavia;
<br>
he came to US as a political refugee. He is now a snowboarding instructor in
<br>
Vermont during the winter, and lives in New York during the summer.
<br>
<p>The interesting message is the second one below.

<p><p>I have no objections to you posting my message to the Extropy list
<br>
as is. Remember, I wrote for Mladina in times when guys who sold
<br>
Mladina were beaten up in the streets of Belgrade. I just don't give
<br>
a damn. Besides, &quot;extropy&quot; seems to be a relatively cool new-
<br>
agean post-modernist concept. Transhumanism? Challenging aging
<br>
and death? Hell, yeah. That's why I snowboard. So, I am an
<br>
extropian in a sense, too.

<em>&gt; Eh, when you live long enough in the US, the CNN is transparent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you as Delo, Vjesnik or Politika. In Europe (both the post-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communist East and the West), media are generally politically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colored. Opinionated one way or another. In the US, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream media are trying to portray themselves as politically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unbiased, objective reporters of events. But, of course, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not. CNN depends on advertising. Advertising depends on ratings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ratings depend on &quot;hot&quot; stories. &quot;Hot&quot; stories are wars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earthquakes, presidents that were serviced by their interns orally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black ex-football stars that possibly killed their spouses, etc. CNN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does financially better when the peace talks fail than when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peace talks succeed. Therefore, it should be pretty obvious where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their bias lies. The other influence is the bias of individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journalists. American journalists are intellectual whores, just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ours are. They like socializing with the rich and powerful. So, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are careful how they approach topics that can hurt the 'special'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship they are trying to build with the VIP crowd. Self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; censorship is as adamantly practiced as it was in Yugoslavia. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all like to be invited for dinners to the White House. The third thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the instinct to go with the herd. This instinct is extremely strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US. You'll see people patiently waiting in line to enter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bus. You'll see people orderly organized in rows of two marching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the movie theater. You'll see drivers milling at the same slow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed one after another at equidistance in the same lane. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cozy, warm feeling of being a part of some larger unquestioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure is eerily welcomed in the land of the free. Everybody eats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turkey for Thanksgivings and all college bound teenage males wear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baggy kakis and polo shirts. That is also re-enforced by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; college education that emphasizes participation in uniformity. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better you are at being mediocre, the more succesfull you will be at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being whatever you want to be. Thus, the top journalists are usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither the most talented writers, nor the most enthusiastic muck-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rackers. This is how the US preserves its cherished status-quo, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rich can sleep soundly at night.
