</em><br>
<p>The private information can either be that they will take action if they
<br>
get enough bonds, in which case their intentions cannot be too obvious,
<br>
or their private information can be how many bonds they will end up
<br>
holding, in which case they cannot very predictably end up with
<br>
enough bonds to make it worth their while.   But even if speculators
<br>
only hold a tiny fraction of bonds at all times, their expectations can
<br>
drive the price up to a point where the bondholders do not profit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2) For every buyer there is a seller.  While a buyer has an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incentive to help the social policy, the seller has an incentive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hurt that policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are holders, non-holders, future holders, and past holders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Holders care about success, the others don't. ...  While a holder
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; is in the process of selling, her incentive is to make the price
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; higher.  After she's sold, she doesn't care anymore.  Someone who
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; doesn't hold and is thinking of buying wants the price to be low.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; After he buys, he wants the price to be high.
</em><br>
<p>The simplest case to explain would be if someone were selling
<br>
the bonds short.  But there are other relevant cases as well.
