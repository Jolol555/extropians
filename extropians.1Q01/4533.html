<em>&gt; &gt; I'm curious as to what you saw that was unfair about the election.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An admission that a measurement has an error, and the realization that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a measurement without an error bar wouldn't survive even a trace of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer scrutiny. That apart from the obvious cases of &quot;candidate A won&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;candidate B won&quot; or &quot;candidate C won&quot; there's also &quot;within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error margins, we can't tell, so it's a tie&quot;, and a procedere for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolving such. As flipping an unbiased coin, or a public duel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apart from that, anything with a &quot;democracy&quot; somewhere in it is supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to represent the meaning of majority of voters. Not representatives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such, or some d'Hondtian games with numbers. Not to open the can of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worms of basis democracy vs. elitism...
</em><br>
<p>a) we're not a democracy, we are a republic
<br>
b) we are not a democracy, we are a republic
<br>
c) we are not a democracy, we are a republic
<br>
<p>Now, what did I miss?
<br>
<p>Oh, yeah, simple majorities here can't:
<br>
change the constitution
<br>
override a veto
<br>
comdemn a man to death
<br>
declare martial law
<br>
change the law after the fact
<br>
and, elect a president and vice president
<br>
<p>The Supreme Court satisfied the 'flipping the coin' part, by deciding
<br>
that Gore cheated by trying to change the coin to a two headed one in
<br>
mid-toss, so Bush won by default.
<br>
<p>Now, I wouldn't have minded much if they had duelled, tho I 'spect that
<br>
Gore woulda demanded three people as seconds, bragged that he invented
<br>
duelling and thus gets to decide the rules AFTER having walked ten
<br>
paces, denied the referee had any controlling and legal authority,
<br>
Tipper would have demanded that videos of the duel carry warning labels,
<br>
Gore would have denied ever having smoked a barrel ('cept maybe once),
<br>
and the press would have declared Gore the winner before a shot was
<br>
fired.
