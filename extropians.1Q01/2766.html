</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In evaluating the various technologies that are currently following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponential development paths, it seems a good idea to sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the brute force ones from the elegant ones.
</em><br>
<p>I liked reading your post - it was full of ideas, most of which I do not yet
<br>
entirely comprehend.
<br>
<p>However, one small thought that occured to me while reading the last quoted
<br>
paragraph above:
<br>
<p>There is one thing that I think we need to accomplish as soon as possible -
<br>
possibly before we start sorting out brute force methods from elegant ones.
<br>
That thing is... a backup copy of our civilization. On something like Mars.
<br>
<p>The more our technology progresses, the more we risk self-destruction that
<br>
no living thing on this planet will be able to escape. I think the only way
<br>
we can truly avoid a scenario of total destruction is to populate other
<br>
parts of the solar system as soon as possible - and to make them
<br>
self-sustainable.
<br>
<p>I think this should be *the* top priority of world's major governments; the
<br>
danger of inadvertent self-destruction looms more and more each day. It
<br>
seems to me that programs like NASA are vastly under-financed - people seem
<br>
to think that &quot;we've been there, done that&quot;. But I think we haven't even
<br>
scratched the surface; we really need to invest to establish a backup
<br>
civilization. If I were Mr Bush, I would invest those USD 1.3 trillion
<br>
directly into space, not into tax cuts.
<br>
<p>Again, just my 2.35 Yen.
