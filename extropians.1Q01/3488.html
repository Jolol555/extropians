<p>
I apologize to those who found my silly posts to be offensive.  As a native
<br>
Mississippian, I feel that I have the right to make fun of my fellow deep
<br>
south friends/family, or at least I should be allowed to use that fact as an
<br>
excuse ;).  I didn't mean to be offensive, simply humorous.  Many comedians
<br>
use hyperbole and stereotyping as a tool in making people laugh.  I can
<br>
certainly see how, if the post concerning &quot;white trash&quot; was read by someone
<br>
without a sense of humor, that person could easily have been offended or
<br>
felt that I was being mean spirited or even classist or racist.  If that was
<br>
the case for you, I apologize for offending your delicate sensibilities.
<br>
Please add my name to your filter list and/or disregard any further posting
<br>
of mine, as it may contain some pathetic attempt at humor.  I can't imagine
<br>
living in a humor free world - it sounds very sad and lonely.
<br>
<p>In the future I will both attempt to stimulate interesting conversation as
<br>
well as post silly nonsense.  I hope that the powers that be don't decide
<br>
that this must be a humor free list.  I will try not to be so directly
<br>
offensive next time, and those of you who were offended, please give me the
<br>
benefit of a doubt or simply don't read my posts next time.
<br>
<p>Terry
