<p>Why would you say that either is more capitalistic than the US?  In 
<br>
terms of percentage of the GDP spent on Government services, the US 
<br>
is a little below Sweden, though not by much.  The US actually has 
<br>
the least amount of government expenditures as a percentage of GDP vs 
<br>
all other OECD countries.  I'm not sure about Singapore, since I 
<br>
didn't see any data on them when I looked, but I'd imagine that 
<br>
they're in a class with a lot of other SE Asian countries that are 
<br>
growing like gangbusters - in large part because they're embracing 
<br>
capitalism.  I didn't mention them because they don't have the 
<br>
long-term history of stability that makes for easier analysis, like 
<br>
most of the countries of the OECD.  I was trying to stick with big 
<br>
countries that are well known examples a societal framework, I 
<br>
probably should have been more pedantic.
<br>
<p>Regardless, the existence of more capitalistic countries doing well 
<br>
hardly disproves my overall point.  They're countries that are 
<br>
embracing capitalism and kicking ass, which reinforces the notion 
<br>
that as you move toward the communist end of the scale, there are 
<br>
nothing but economic failures.  As you move toward the capitalism end 
<br>
of the scale, economic successes abound.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  and most of south america more capitalist than
</em><br>
<p>Capitalism requires a government strong enough and ethical enough to 
<br>
enforce property rights and protect its citizens from initiation of 
<br>
force.  You can't have fair trading of your goods and services when 
<br>
you have to bribe every government official, drug lord, and land 
<br>
owner that you encounter.  Most (if not all) of South America lacks 
<br>
the kind of government needed to support capitalism.
<br>
<p>Jerry Mitchell mentioned &lt;<a href="http://www.capitalism.org/">http://www.capitalism.org/</a>&gt;.  They have a 
<br>
fairly good description of what I mean when I use the word 
<br>
&quot;capitalism&quot;.  South America's foray into corruption ain't it.
<br>
<p>Regards,
