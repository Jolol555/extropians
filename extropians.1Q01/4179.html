</em><br>
<p>I'm sympathetic to your argument, and I will do whatever seems to be the list
<br>
consensus/preference of the list managers.  Personally, I prefer full-text
<br>
articles plus a link for the following reason:
<br>
<p>Including the entire text reduces the possibilty that the poster will change
<br>
the meaning of the author's words.
<br>
<p>I find most of the stuff on I need on the web via search engines.  Most
<br>
search engines rank sites with more relevant text higher than sites with less
<br>
relevant text.  If our goal is to further extropy, then one way to do that
<br>
would be to increase the rankings of the extropy archives by increasing the
<br>
amount of relevant text.
<br>
<p>Links are ephemeral--someone searching the archive a year from now will find
<br>
many of the links to be dead.  Including the entire text ensures that the
<br>
text to which the conversation refers is still available for future readers
<br>
to see.
<br>
<p>Makes it easier to respond to multiple portions of the text.  (As Harvey did
<br>
with the FDA/Olestra forward).
<br>
<p>Sources of good articles often have other articles by the same author that I
<br>
enjoy.  While including the full-text for a given article may reduce the
<br>
likelihood that others will click to see that particular article, many will
<br>
click anyway to see what else that author has written.
<br>
<p>On the other hand,  in addition to what you cite above, including the full
<br>
text has the following disadvantages:
<br>
<p>I don't get permission from the author, who may be unwilling to allow his/her
<br>
article to be forwarded to a mailing list.   Forwarding full text is likely a
<br>
violation of fair use statutes.
<br>
<p>Readers with slow/pay per minute connections are forced to download the
<br>
entire article, when they may prefer to read the article only if the a
<br>
blurb/summary interests them.
