<p>Quite a few people might disagree with you ...
<br>
<p>My take on it is that what you're describing *should* be the case --
<br>
but all too often, it isn't. I see two reasons for this. Firstly, it's
<br>
a lot easier to quantify cramming of facts (via multiple-choice exam
<br>
papers) than comprehension (via observation of critical faculties in
<br>
action); consequently, educational organizations focus on what they can
<br>
quantify. Secondly, and more controversially, as Ivan Illich observed,
<br>
schools are not in the business of educating children: they're in the
<br>
business of conditioning them to take up a role in an industrial society.
<br>
(A role that typically corresponds to the working practices prevalent one
<br>
or two generations ago, at that.)
<br>
<p>(Note: I don't agree with Ivan Illich's ideology or prescription, I merely
<br>
think that his analysis deserves a cautious nod.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Kids don't know what they want to learn nor which basic skills will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enable them to learn it straight out of the womb.  While I agree that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is important to teach the joy of learning and the practicalities of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are fundamental tools, I don't think the average tyke is in a position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to organize ver own education.  Now after they learn some basic skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and get exposed to more of the broad world, say by high school or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; junior high for many, earlier for some, more self-directed learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be appropriate.  At the least learning at one's own pace would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an improvement for many. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Yup. Unfortunately this isn't what most school systems are geared up to
<br>
provide. Hell, I went to a private school that prided itself on pushing
<br>
its students hard and on a very high university-level success rate ...
<br>
but I didn't get any explicit teaching in logic, philosophy or reasoning
<br>
until I was 17. (Calculus at 15, by the way. Just to give you a point of
<br>
comparison.)
