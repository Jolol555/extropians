<p><em>&gt; In 1957, the Air Force dropped a ten megaton nuclear

<em>&gt; bomb outside Albuquerque. In 1967, two, twenty four
</em><br>
<em>&gt; megaton bombs in North Carolina; five of six
</em><br>
failsafes
<br>
<em>&gt; were tripped on one bomb—the one with the parachute,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind you. The other one they never found. The chute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't open and it went into soft ground. Somewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's still there. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-fiftieth of one megaton.
</em><br>
<p>And how many of these weapons detonated?  None?  
<br>
<p>**Obviously. There was, however, a missile which
<br>
exploded in its silo when a tech dropped a wrench. The
<br>
warhead was blown through the 740-ton concrete slab
<br>
covering the silo. Such an event would rupture ANY
<br>
nannite containment mechanism. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nuclear warheads do not eat through their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; containment mechanisms.
</em><br>
<p>And nanoreplicators would?  Why?
<br>
<p>**Because the primary design function of nanoweapons
<br>
will be to self-replicate and disassemble. Programming
<br>
them to be incapable of disassembling any particular
<br>
substance (as a substance used for containment
<br>
purposes) would make them useless as weapons because
<br>
the enemy could employ that material to shield its
<br>
forces. True, they should be programmed not to exceed
<br>
a given total number of replications--but a bug in the
<br>
code of a single nannite could destroy the earth.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Three more bombs off Delaware and two in Texas the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same year. Another off Georgia the next year. Two
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; on Spain in 1966. Four more on Greenland in '68…
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Detonators have gone off. The same year we torpedoed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own sub with two nukes on board. Classified for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twenty five years. It's still going on; it just
</em><br>
hasn't
<br>
<em>&gt; been declassified yet. The Russian record is, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, far worse.
</em><br>
<p>And despite all these mishaps, there were no nuclear
<br>
explosions.
<br>
<p>**The conditions required to produce fission, and
<br>
particularly dual-stage implosion leading to fusion,
<br>
are exacting and will not, generally speaking, occur
<br>
on their own. Thus, blowing a warhead through a
<br>
740-ton concrete slab is not sufficient to detonate
<br>
that warhead. (Detonation requires symmetrical
<br>
implosion.) Do the same thing with a shell containing
<br>
disassembler nannites--and they enter the environment.
<br>
Unlike radiation form a warhead, the nannites go forth
<br>
and multiply--and disassemble.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As to reactors: Browns Ferry, I believe it was,
</em><br>
nearly
<br>
<em>&gt; burned to the ground because some idiot with a
</em><br>
LIGHTER
<br>
<em>&gt; or a candle was poking it into FLAMMABLE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insulation--AND the redundant wiring ran right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alongside the primary wiring. Windscale, Chernobyl,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three Mile Island all released radiation into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atmosphere. 
</em><br>
<p>And despite the most appalling of human stupidity, all
<br>
these accidents
<br>
*combined* have killed only a small fraction of those
<br>
who have died in
<br>
other industrial accidents.  
<br>
<p>**Yes. Again because the results of an accident are
<br>
not self-replicating. They are local. Even if a nuke
<br>
detonates in Manhattan--the effects are geographically
<br>
limited. Not so with nanoweapons.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We release self-replicating nannites,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ONCE, and it's over.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  Nanotech is not magic.
<br>
<p>**A single nonlimited disassembler will destroy the
<br>
earth in a matter of days. Period.

<br>
<p>interesting.
<br>
<p>**I'll take a look. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We are not competent to control nanotechnology
</em><br>
<p>Possible.  It is a more difficult problem than nuclear
<br>
weapons and power,
<br>
since nanotech does not require exotic, easily
<br>
controlled materials.
<br>
However, it is far from obvious that it is hopeless,
<br>
as you seem to think.
<br>
<p><p>**The nature of Man makes it hopeless, or nearly so.
