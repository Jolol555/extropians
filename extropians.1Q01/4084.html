<p>Incorrect: you simply need to reach a consensus on what *is* true
<br>
communism that includes the communists as well as their critics.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think one point that tends to be overlooked by extropians
<br>
is that both communism and capitalism have one glaring similarity: they
<br>
are economic systems designed to allocate resources under conditions of
<br>
scarcity. Hopefully we're leaving scarcity behind us forever -- in which
<br>
case triumphalism over the &quot;collapse of communism&quot; is premature because
<br>
capitalism will follow it in due course, and good riddance to both those
<br>
eighteenth century frameworks.
