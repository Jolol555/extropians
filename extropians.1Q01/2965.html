<p>It appears as if Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20true%20abundance?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101312314.AAA18147@color.sics.se&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<br>
<p>I do think so, since females and males have different chromosomes. Some
<br>
diseases appear mainly in males due to DNA differences (males have one
<br>
copy, while females do have two copies). Since the intelligence and all
<br>
the other products of &quot;the mind&quot; (whatever it &quot;is&quot;) is implemented by a
<br>
device built on orders from the DNA, I cannot understand why those &quot;mind&quot;
<br>
parts somehow should form an island, as it were, in the organism which
<br>
does not feel the impact from a DNA difference. It appears very improbable
<br>
that that should be the case. There're lots of data in one chromosome,
<br>
after all.
<br>
<p>I do not wish to enter the arena of discussing the semantics of &quot;gender&quot;
<br>
versus &quot;sex&quot; in the contemporary American language, however.
