Someone posted recently about research towards Mega-scale Engineering.  Here
<br>
is a website I ran across about climate engineering.  I haven't had the
<br>
chance to review it fully, but it may have some interesting ideas.

<br>
<p><p>Abstract:
<br>
This review of climate engineering proposals aims to provide a
<br>
comprehensive resource of up to date information and ideas for
<br>
people concerned about the development of large-scale technical
<br>
fixes to counter the problem of global warming. The proposals fall
<br>
into three main categories: increasing the reflection of solar
<br>
radiation back to space, enhancing natural sinks of carbon dioxide,
<br>
and direct disposal of carbon dioxide captured at source. In
<br>
addition, proposals involving weather modification, ozone chemistry
<br>
and terraforming Mars are mentioned briefly. Direct disposal of
<br>
carbon dioxide is included because it involves exploitation of &quot;global
<br>
commons&quot; such as the deep ocean, and because it is often
<br>
compared with schemes to increase natural sinks. Some of these
<br>
proposals are realistic and thus a real cause for concern, whilst the
<br>
reader may find amusement in reading some of the crazier
<br>
schemes! All of these technical fixes are intended to tackle the
<br>
symptom of the problem of fossil fuel consumption. The
<br>
development of technology to encourage energy efficiency or
<br>
renewable energy, on the other hand, which is intended to reduce
<br>
that consumption, is much less controversial, and is not considered
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>Some academic research projects which may lead to climate
<br>
engineering, such as fertilisation of the Southern Ocean with added
<br>
Iron, have recently received much media attention. However, the
<br>
media seems to be less aware of the much larger community of
<br>
researchers who are employed by the fossil fuel and power
<br>
industries to investigate similar proposals for enhancing CO2 sinks.
<br>
This review aims to clarify not only how each proposal might work or
<br>
fail, but also who is promoting each idea. Sponsorship by the fossil
<br>
fuel industry is closely linked to the bluffing game of international
<br>
greenhouse politics, where excuses for doing nothing are always
<br>
welcome.
<br>
<p>Hidden political values are concealed in cost-benefit analyses, in
<br>
which a trade off can be made between climate engineering or
<br>
climate warming damages, implying that consumption is already
<br>
non-negotiable. The &quot;just in case&quot; argument for backing climate
<br>
engineering research may become a self-fulfilling prophesy in this
<br>
political context, but in the real world the choice might then be
<br>
between two potential catastrophes, for positive feedback
<br>
processes make the climate system inherently surprising. I conclude
<br>
by asking whether such research should continue, and how we might
<br>
check its momentum in the future.
