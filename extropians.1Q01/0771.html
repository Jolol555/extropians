<p>Never believe a word an Australian tells you. Terrible liars, the lot of
<br>
'em. For example, as I reported somewhere long ago:
<br>
<p>I met the fabled Harlan Ellison at dinner in Melbourne: charming and
<br>
energetic, smacking his lips and crying aloud in a species of Greek and
<br>
thus endearing himself to the sceptical restaurateur. He spent so much of
<br>
his time gazing with hard direct eyes at one or another of us, telling
<br>
each, in his turn that he was 'a remarkable man' (a gambit modified, I
<br>
believe, for Dianne and Irene) that he was taken at the end for a fellow of
<br>
the most piercing insight and gentility. At last Dianne leaned across to me
<br>
and asked, not at all sotto voce, 'Why does everyone hate this man?' No one
<br>
did, not any more. 
<br>
<p>Harlan had been in Australia a week; it was his pleasure to regale us
<br>
obdurate city-dwellers with tales of Outback mystery. With enormous relish
<br>
he described the flightless Emoo, an unstoppable marauding bird protected
<br>
by matted feathers so dense that high-powered rifle bullets bounce clean
<br>
off. Harried farmers in four-wheel drives, he reported, find themselves
<br>
obliged to pursue it through the night, their hammering machine-gun the
<br>
sole weapon capable of felling the beast. Our muffled chokes and shrieks
<br>
gave the game away. 'I'll kill that son of a bitch,' he vowed, delighted. 
<br>
<p>(`Emu', BTW, is pronounced `ee-mew' not `ee-moo'. Hang on, does that work
<br>
in Yank? `Eem-you'. You can trust me on this, I'm an Australian.)
<br>
<p>Actually, now that I think about it, veggie-mites would be the least of our
<br>
nutritional problems. In the late '50s and early '60s, when television here
<br>
was scratchy and b&amp;w, they ran a much-loved sentimental ad which possessed,
<br>
as I only now perceive, a dark and shuddering subtext. A bunch of dear
<br>
little tanned children in atrocious swimming costumes (or `cozzies') would
<br>
cavort in sprays of water from a garden sprinkler, smiling like loons and
<br>
singing in chorus:
<br>
<p>`We're happy little Vegemites
<br>
`As gay as gay can be
<br>
..........or something along those lines, maybe it was `bright'
<br>
`We always eat our Vegemite
<br>
`For breakfast, lunch and tea.'
<br>
<p>Belatedly, I see the vile truth so brazenly reported in those childish lyrics:
<br>
<p>VEGEMITE IS SOYLENT-GREEN!
