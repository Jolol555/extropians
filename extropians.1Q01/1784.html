<em>&gt;&gt;In 1997, the Australian Institure of Criminology stats show that for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;entire country of some 19 million people, there were 360 homicides. One a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;day. 76 used firearms 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Proving a point, obviously lowering the gun related deaths isn't the motive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as there aren't enough of them to matter. 
</em><br>
<p>What? Oh, of course, it was an evil plot by the Fourth International to
<br>
strip Aussies of our only defence against our vicious, deomcratically
<br>
elected socialist government. (`Socialist'? Socialite, maybe.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the motive WAS to lower deaths,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it failed miserably. 
</em><br>
<p>I won't get into this tiresome discussion beyond amplifying the obvious
<br>
corrective I already provided. I see no attempt to relate to the ethos
<br>
behind these data, which is really what's at issue. Guns don't kill people,
<br>
some of the people who have access to guns (and knives and syringes of
<br>
HIV-contaminated blood) kill people. In Australia, very few people do so.
<br>
One of the reasons is that we long ago chose democratically to deny
<br>
ourselves free access to hand guns and certain other lethal firearms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I noticed you didn't go after the Australia wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;armed robberies up 44% stat. 
</em><br>
<p>You are referring to the data at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/stats/robbery/index.html#graphs">http://www.aic.gov.au/stats/robbery/index.html#graphs</a>
<br>
<p>which shows a close-to-flat rate in use of firearms in robberies. Other
<br>
weapons are on the increase, and have been for some time. As in the USA,
<br>
this is very probably related directly to the spread of the drug sub-culture.
<br>
<p>Your implication, I take it, is that the (quite limited) additional
<br>
restrictive gun laws introduced in Australia have led to an outbreak of
<br>
armed robberies of banks, stores, etc. Perhaps you imagine that banks
<br>
managers and their guards, previously armed to the teeth, now cower
<br>
defenceless before any punk who arrives with an illegal gun. Get a grip on
<br>
reality.
