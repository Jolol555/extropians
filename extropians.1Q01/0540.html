<p>
My take on &quot;extremism&quot; is that extremists try to go as far as 
<br>
possible in one direction or the other.  I think the real answer is 
<br>
always somewhere in the middle.  That means that you have to pull 
<br>
reality toward the correct answer until suddenly, when you've reached 
<br>
the appropriate position, you have to stop or pull back the other way!
<br>
<p>Most people cannot judge such an even-handed approach.  They decide 
<br>
on a direction to move, and then keep moving in that direction 
<br>
forever.  Almost all people hold this kind of view on any topic. 
<br>
Anybody who proposes some middle ground will be accused by both sides 
<br>
of being an advocate for the other side.  Most people divide every 
<br>
issue into two positions only, and then play tug-of-war as far as 
<br>
they can go.  They go as far as possible for their direction, and can 
<br>
never concede a single point to the opposing side, or admit that 
<br>
there are logical limitations to their position up to a point.
<br>
<p>Examples of extremism in my view would include:
<br>
<p>- pro-gun position that allows arms of any type for any person
<br>
- anti-gun position that removes all guns for everyone
<br>
<p>- pro-government position that wants the government to control everything
<br>
- anti-government position that wants no government at all
<br>
<p>- pro-technology position that thinks technology is good for its own sake
<br>
- anti-technology position that thinks technology is evil automatically
<br>
<p>- pro-Bush position that think the Democrats caused the election problems
<br>
- pro-Gore position that think Republicans caused the election problems
<br>
<p>- pro-evolution position that evolution always produces the best solution
<br>
- anti-evolution position that evolution never produces the best solution
<br>
<p>- pro-market position that markets always produce the best solution
<br>
- anti-market position that markets never produce the best solution
<br>
<p>The fact of the matter is that any position can be taken to 
<br>
unreasonable extremes.  Most people can't recognize this.  It 
<br>
confuses them when they push for their solution and suddenly they go 
<br>
too far.  They become disoriented when someone allows their solution 
<br>
to be applied &quot;hypothetically&quot; in all cases, to the point they start 
<br>
running into problems.  This is why most people become defensive in 
<br>
theoretical debates or retroactively start rewording their position. 
<br>
They &quot;know&quot; they are right, and can't understand why their &quot;obviously 
<br>
right&quot; position fails when applied to pure clear-cut examples.
<br>
<p>I would argue that 45% of the people are extremists on either side of 
<br>
any issue, and only 10% of the people choose a median position or a 
<br>
third position.  This small minority will always be accused of being 
<br>
on either side, of flip-flopping, or just left out of the debate 
<br>
totally.  They will be seen as supporting one side on one point, and 
<br>
then suddenly supporting the other side on another point.  They will 
<br>
alternatively be friends and enemies of either camp.  No one will be 
<br>
able to tell where they stand.  They will insist on integrity, logic 
<br>
and consistency on every issue, and yet most people will not be able 
<br>
to predict their position.  They are not easily classified into 
<br>
two-label systems.
<br>
<p>As a self-test, I would argue that anybody who agrees with one side 
<br>
of an issue all the time is an extremist.  No group is right 100% of 
<br>
the time.  The rare person who is more correct than most would be in 
<br>
a small minority.  They will never agree with the status-quo or 
<br>
default position of their group all of the time.  If one finds 
<br>
oneself agreeing with their party, PAC, group or spokesperson all the 
<br>
time, I would worry about being an extremist or a &quot;sheeple&quot;.  If one 
<br>
agrees all the time, one can never surpass the understanding of truth 
<br>
beyond the position that they already follow.  In any debate or 
<br>
negotiation, the fair arbitrator always angers and pleases both sides 
<br>
equally.  Anybody who serves one side only is not being fair.
