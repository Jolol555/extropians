<br>
<p>Large study shows omega-3 fatty acids do not increase hemorrhagic stroke
<br>
risk
<br>
<p>Fish consumption has been demonstrated to lower the risk of  stroke in
<br>
several studies, however, because of ecologic studies showing Greenland
<br>
Eskimos having a high intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found
<br>
in fish oils had an excess risk of hemorrhagic stroke compared with Danish
<br>
Caucasians, the concern has been voiced that while consuming fish or fish
<br>
oil is effective at preventing thrombotic stroke, the risk of hemorrhagic
<br>
stroke could be increased. The January 17, 20001 issue of the Journal of
<br>
the American Medical Association published the results of large study
<br>
which is the first of its kind showing the effect of fish and omega-3
<br>
fatty acid consumption on stroke broken down by type of stroke.
<br>
Researchers used data from the Nurses' Health Study, which utilized data
<br>
from 79,839 women between the ages of 34 to 59 years in 1980 who were
<br>
followed up for fourteen years.  The study participants completed food
<br>
frequency questionnaires which provided the researchers with data
<br>
concerning fish consumption.  The amount of omega-3 fatty acids consumed
<br>
was calculated by the researchers according to the type of fish eaten.
<br>
During the follow-up period, 574 strokes were reported, which included 303
<br>
ischemic strokes, 181 hemorrhagic strokes, and 90 of undetermined origin.
<br>
Reduction in stroke risk was correlated with the amount of fish consumed.
<br>
Fish and omega-3 fatty acid consumption was inversely associated with the
<br>
risk of thrombotic stroke, especially among women who did not take
<br>
aspirin. Women who consumed fish two or more times per week experienced a
<br>
48% reduction in thrombotic stroke.
<br>
<p>No association was found between the consumption of fish and omega-3 fatty
<br>
acids and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.  The study authors note
<br>
that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids is lower in the United States than
<br>
that of Greenland Eskimo or Danish groups studied.  This knowledge should
<br>
help to alleviate concerns that fish oil supplements might increase
<br>
hemorrhagic stroke risk.
<br>
<p>The authors propose the following mechanisms for omega-3 fatty acids'
<br>
ability to diminish stroke incidence:  platelet aggregation inhibition,
<br>
decreased blood viscosity, leukotriene formation suppression, fibrinogen
<br>
reduction and lowering of blood pressure.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Long-sought stroke prevention in diabetes with ramipril
<br>
<p>The January 2 2001 issue of American Heart Association (AHA) journal
<br>
Circulation and the January issue of AHA's Stroke published a
<br>
comprehensive article entitled &quot;Primary Prevention of Ischemic Stroke : A
<br>
Statement for Healthcare Professionals From the Stroke Council of the
<br>
American Heart Association&quot; which, among other important guidelines,
<br>
recommended the use of the drug ramipril, or Altace R to diabetics to
<br>
prevent stroke. These latest recommendations are based on the findings of
<br>
the HOPE Trial, which stands for Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation
<br>
which showed that diabetics taking the drug can reduce the risk of stroke
<br>
by a third. The findings of the HOPE trial were published in the January
<br>
20, 2000 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
<br>
<p>Diabetes is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the
<br>
number one killer of diabetics and diabetics are two to four times more
<br>
likely to suffer a stroke than nondiabetics. Of 9541 patients enrolled in
<br>
the HOPE trial, a substudy 3577 diabetics with at least one other
<br>
cardiovascular risk factor were give ramipril or a placebo. Jeffrey
<br>
Probstfield, M.D., professor of medicine, University of Washington and
<br>
Investigator of the HOPE study commented, &quot;In patients with diabetes who
<br>
took Altace, the risk reduction for stroke was 33 percent . . . The HOPE
<br>
results also showed that Altace protects people with diabetes beyond just
<br>
reducing risk of events. Patients treated with Altace have a 22 percent
<br>
reduction in the need for laser eye therapy and a 16 percent lower risk of
<br>
permanent kidney damage.&quot;

<p>PROTOCOLS
<br>
Hemorrhagic stroke
<br>
<p>The most common diagnostic procedures for determining the cause of
<br>
hemorrhagic stroke are CT scan, MRI, and cerebral angiogram. These
<br>
procedures are used to determine the type of stroke and the specific area
<br>
of the brain that has been affected. Treatment of the stroke is based on
<br>
the findings of these procedures.
<br>
<p>There are two subcategories of hemorrhagic stroke: intracerebral
<br>
hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Although ICH and SAH
<br>
are very similar, they generally result from different causes.
<br>
<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage is defined as the rupturing of cranial blood
<br>
vessels, resulting in the leakage of blood into brain tissues. The most
<br>
common risk factor for ICH is chronic hypertension; hypertension causes
<br>
arteries and arterioles to become weakened, resulting in leakage. A
<br>
Chinese study noted that there was considerable increased risk for ICH in
<br>
hypertensive patients who did not regularly take their medications.
<br>
Additional risk factors for ICH include drug and alcohol abuse,
<br>
anticoagulant medications, age, gender, and race. Excessive alcohol
<br>
consumption and drug use, particularly of cocaine and amphetamines, are
<br>
the most common causes of ICH for people in their 20s and 30s.
<br>
Anticoagulants, such as Coumadin or Heparin, are prescribed for a variety
<br>
of conditions, including ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and deep
<br>
vein thrombosis.
<br>
<p>Treatment of hemorrhagic stroke is based on the underlying cause of the
<br>
hemorrhage and the extent of damage to the brain: treatment includes
<br>
medication and surgical intervention. In patients with
<br>
hypertension-induced ICH, initial treatment involves the use of
<br>
antihypertensive agents. If the hemorrhage results from the use of
<br>
anticoagulants, such as Coumadin or Heparin, these medications are
<br>
discontinued immediately. Protamine and vitamin K may be given to reduce
<br>
bleeding in patients with anticoagulant-induced bleeding.

<p>ISCHEMIC STROKE
<br>
<p>We often consider &quot;heart attack&quot; as a &quot;life or death&quot; health event.
<br>
Strokes have been given less attention, but the new realization that the
<br>
disease is an acute event has now led to stroke being referred to as a
<br>
&quot;brain attack.&quot; Thrombotic strokes are a major cause of brain attacks, and
<br>
are caused in part by atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diseases that
<br>
cause abnormal arterial blood clot formation (thrombosis) such as atrial
<br>
fibrillation and heart valve replacement.
<br>
<p>An analysis of 18 trials documented a 23% reduction in stroke risk with
<br>
anti-platelet agents. The drug ticlopidine was found to be the most
<br>
effective anti-platelet agent, but its adverse side effects frequently
<br>
restrict its long-term use. A more benign approach such as use of aspirin
<br>
or nutrients like ginkgo biloba, melatonin, fish oil, and garlic, as well
<br>
as green tea extract, may be as effective and are free of side effects.
<br>
<p>Consideration should now be given to the use of melatonin as part of an
<br>
integrated treatment for thrombotic stroke according to a 1998 report
<br>
which says &quot;Melatonin is one of the most powerful scavengers of free
<br>
radicals. Because it easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier, this
<br>
antioxidant may, in the future, be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's
<br>
and Parkinson's diseases, stroke, nitric oxide, neurotoxicity and
<br>
hyperbaric oxygen exposure.&quot; (Biol. Signals Recept., July1998,
<br>
7:4,195-219)

Carnosine and stroke neuroprotection
<br>
<p>Two Russian studies show that carnosine protects the brain in simulated
<br>
strokes (Stvolinsky SL et al., 1999; Boldyrev AA et al., 1997). In the
<br>
first experiment, rats were exposed to low pressure hypoxia. Rats given
<br>
carnosine beforehand were able to keep standing and breathing almost twice
<br>
as long as the others. After the hypoxia, carnosine treated rats were able
<br>
to stand after 4.3 minutes, as compared to 6.3 minutes for the untreated
<br>
rats.
<br>
<p>The second study simulated stroke through arterial occlusion. Rats treated
<br>
with carnosine displayed a more normal EEG, less lactate accumulation (a
<br>
common measure of injury severity), and better cerebral blood flow
<br>
restoration. The study also demonstrated that carnosine preserves activity
<br>
of a key enzyme, Na/K-ATPase, which extracts energy stored in ATP to drive
<br>
the cellular sodium pump. Na/K-ATPase inhibition has been found to
<br>
correlate with edema in the ischemic (blood-deprived) region.
