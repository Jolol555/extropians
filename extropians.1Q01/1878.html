<em>&gt; &gt; Hello,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How about a rocket that you can carry around and set on the ground,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where it will then launch itself into space.  Here I am talking about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rocket that weighs less than fifty pounds.  It would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-contained levelling stand so it could point in the good direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to achieve orbit.  I am thinking it would have a propellant or ion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exhaust.  If it was fusion powered, it could escape the plasma into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; launch vesicle, and power itself from the via ramscoop once it hit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; velocity.  You would have to stand fifty or a hundred meters away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alternate approach: give it wings sufficient to take off from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercial airport.  Much easier integration into existing aerospace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure that way, even if the wings aren't that useful once in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit.  Even non-fusion-powered plasma might be doable to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit, since you'd only have to supply a few minutes of power from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; batteries or capacitors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The challenge here would be making the engine light but powerful enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deliver &gt; 1 G of thrust.  Existing similar engines are designed for,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at most, .05 G, though that's mainly because they're envisioned only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for use after launch, for hours or days of constant thrust, with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onboard power plant which would be inordinately heavy if providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power for 1 G.  I suspect one could get some useful economies of scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the engine gets more powerful; at worst, though, if one engine gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X newtons of thrust above what it needs to thrust itself (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power source, reaction mass, and structure to hold the engine) at 1 G
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or whatever launch acceleration is desired) for the launch period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (that is, however long it takes to achieve orbital velocity), and one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs Y newtons of thrust to give the same acceleration over the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period to the rest of the rocket, then one simply needs to mount Y/X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I was thinking along these lines as well.  For example, it could be
<br>
multi-stage rocket or missile, with the lift stage components used as
<br>
reaction mass as its functional apparatus is outmoded.  So, the booster to
<br>
low orbit could direction the launch stage component towards the planet.
<br>
<p>The only practical application of this I have is making those cardboard
<br>
rockets with the chemical engines with electric starters, for examples the
<br>
Estes rocket, that launch and have a parachute or glider to return the
<br>
nacelle and body to Earth.
<br>
<p>So this idea we discuss and alternates would be more user-friendly.   It
<br>
would launch a handful or two of small satellites into orbit, or perhaps an
<br>
integrated satellite.  It could launch a small fixed orbit satellite to watch
<br>
a volcano from above it.
<br>
<p>This might be at a technology level different than ours.
<br>
<p>Then after that, maybe, you could have a PC terminal that you could tell to
<br>
follow you and it would float through the air carrying your other stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this launcher could recharge in orbit (electricity via solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; panels, and reaction mass via ramscoop - though this latter one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be too slow for practical use), it could launch with just enough power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get to orbit plus maneuvering, then at the end of its mission,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverse thrust and drop to near 0 velocity relative to Earth, dropping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back into the atmosphere without resorting to aerobraking (and thus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without needing the thermal protection that aerobraking to remove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbital velocity requires) except to bleed off the last few hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kmph once it gets to its landing area (just like airplanes do).  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, it might be better just to launch it with enough charge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction mass to get to orbit and return, thus allowing mission abort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at any time (better known as &quot;safety margin&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>There could be wings of sufficiently tensile material that could deploy at
<br>
the point of aerobraking.  There could be ornithopters with quite complex and
<br>
liquid surfaces.  Some designs of planes that use canards and other exotic
<br>
enhancements, not to mention vectored thrust, are highly manueverable, but to
<br>
have a bird, that is small enough that it could have complex and very close
<br>
analogs of the actual bird's structure.  What that leads to is the
<br>
development of systems that model organic behavior accurately.
<br>
<p>If there was a a safety concern, it could incinerate itself away from Earth,
<br>
if part of it is a redundant self-destruct mechanism. Besides that, all the
<br>
other systems would be redundantly implemented anyways, generally as a value
<br>
measure, becaused it would inexpensive to do so compared with failure.
<br>
<p>I think that's one place where computer simulation offers a lot of
<br>
opportunity.  For example, if we wrote just now as we did, and the program
<br>
gave us the design to build it, then we have built a good program.
