<p>Well no, at the moment I don't see the breakthrough.  As a matter of
<br>
fact, from my couple of decades inside the software industry I see a lot
<br>
of forces arrayed against any considerable efforts towards such a
<br>
breakthrough being made.  Hell, let's be blunt.  There is a lot of
<br>
energy and momentum arrayed against even incorporating real improvements
<br>
to software design and development made over a decade ago!  Which help
<br>
motivate the question.  Evolutionary algorithms are NOT a silver bullet
<br>
for the problem.  Far from it.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wish software people would stop seeing the world as made of

<p>Everyone has their prejudices.  I don't think either of the groups
<br>
mentioned have what will be needed, yet.  I don't think neuronal models
<br>
and ALife stuff will give us the breakthrough we need although it will
<br>
give many valuable tools and critical understanding of how minds such as
<br>
ours work.  Nor would I write off Comp-Sci and AI so quickly.  We need
<br>
everything we've got and then something we only begin to see or know how
<br>
to do yet.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; tracking of progress?

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>True on the one hand.  On the other hand, it is seen as urgent enough
<br>
and as salvation yet that I would like to see it start moving as a
<br>
project - just on the off chance that it is the only hope after all. 
<br>
Although frankly I think the notion that a &quot;friendly&quot; SI will solve all
<br>
of our most critical problems is extremely unlikely.
