<p><p>I second that.  These are interesting and perilous times we live in.  We
<br>
very much need to spend a fair amount of energy learning to trust one
<br>
another enough to work together and to take energy, ideas, help and some
<br>
sustenance from one another.  There are few enough of us that even begin
<br>
to &quot;get it&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Certainly there are things about this list that don't work often for
<br>
me.  I tends to get bogged down a lot in intellectual exchanges that
<br>
don't have any real meat behind them or go much of anywhere.  Often
<br>
signal gets drowned by noise.  But this doesn't mean signal is not
<br>
present.  It just means we need more efficient filters and amplifiers.  
<br>
<p>As much of what is and is not workable visions of the future and plans
<br>
for producing a desirable future are themselves in some flux it is too
<br>
early imho to say that only that which leads to action is really
<br>
worthwhile.  Sometimes the action is to simply have groups form to
<br>
explore certain lines in detail, or to encourage the expansion and
<br>
nurturing of this idea and the nipping of that one.  Is this action?  It
<br>
doesn't matter if it is judged to be or not. It is still essential.  
<br>
<p>Some of the seeming empty exchanges are simply monkey manueverings to
<br>
attempt to establish trust and territory.  Some of that is necessary for
<br>
the evolved monkeys we are.  Perhaps other parts can be changed
<br>
successfully and productively.
<br>
<p>But this group is a microcosm of the world where our visions will play
<br>
out. It is actually a microcosm highly biased to those more or less
<br>
friendly to our fondest aspirations.  If we cannot learn to deal with
<br>
each other and to inspire each other here then how do we expect to
<br>
succeed in the world at large?
