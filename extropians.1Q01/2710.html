<p>There ain't none. Read it and weep. &quot;The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984
<br>
abolished parole eligibility for federal offenders - except military
<br>
offenders -- who commit offenses on or after November 1, 1987.&quot; Quote
<br>
taken from  <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/uspc/mission.htm">http://www.usdoj.gov/uspc/mission.htm</a>  .
<br>
<p>No parole for any federal offenders for 16 years now and counting. Ergo
<br>
every federal prisoner, or near enough, would wind up there. It's easy
<br>
to forget just how Procrustean the System already is... or is that
<br>
Draconian?
