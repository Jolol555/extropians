<p><em>&gt;Hmm, I am starting to suspect that you have not read up much about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islamic countries. Look at the aggressive industrialisation of Turkey,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Egypt and Iraq for example.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;While there is definitely inertia in adopting new technology in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islamic countries, I doubt it is because they are run by &quot;rabid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;antitech nutballs&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you, Anders, and I appreciate very much Charlie's question.
<br>
<p>If you want to learn about a culture, there is no substitute for
<br>
spending time learning about it- reading their literature,
<br>
experiencing their art, talking to people of that culture, and going
<br>
there. 'Buying into' what the media says is plain stupid, and I can
<br>
see from some comments here that some people here have done that. I
<br>
will remind some here that while Europe was in the Dark Ages,
<br>
science was thriving in the Arab world. The Arabs were well
<br>
acquainted with the philosophical, mathematical, astronomical and
<br>
medical writings of the Greeks. Medieval astronomers in Europe were
<br>
pupils of the Arab astronomers, for example. Pay attention to the
<br>
symbols in the Arab world in use today. Those stars were not put
<br>
there randomly!
<br>
<p>[And personally, I find the Persian style of art and literature and
<br>
dance and music very expressive and suits me very well.]
<br>
<p>If you want examples of strong, individualistic people, it would be
<br>
a very big mistake to disregard the Muslims. Have folks here
<br>
forgotten that for 10 years the Afhans fought the Soviets, and
<br>
_succeeded_ in driving them from their land?  They were certainly
<br>
not the technically superior force. In my opinion, they won
<br>
because they were smarter and the more independent minded. The
<br>
Afghanis had almost none of their own weapons: what they used
<br>
to win that war were captured from the Soviets whom they killed.
<br>
Please see the book: _The Wind Blows Away Our Words: A Firsthand
<br>
Account of the Afghan Resistance_, by Doris Lessing, for
<br>
more details.
<br>
<p>I wrote something about this in Jan 2000 on this list (&quot;Creating New
<br>
States&quot;), but I will repeat parts of again here.
<br>
<p>I think that it is unfortunate that the West associates the words
<br>
&quot;Islam&quot; and &quot;Muslim&quot; with &quot;terrorist&quot; because there are different
<br>
Muslim countries that differ in their practices. I don't know the
<br>
&quot;brand&quot; of Islam that the Chechens practice, but in Afghanistan,
<br>
before &quot;The Catastrophe&quot; (as the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by the
<br>
Soviets was called), their brand of Islam was very temperate. Women
<br>
were going to college, walking unveiled, holding government
<br>
positions. An atmosphere of tolerance existed for differing
<br>
interpretations of Islam.  Their Sunnis and Shias worked together,
<br>
and some in that country felt that Afghanistan was providing a model
<br>
for a liberal Islamic state. That's not true in Afghanistan now.
<br>
<p>In hard times, the extremists in any kind of religious system
<br>
prevail, so it's not surprising to me that the hard-core
<br>
Fundamentalist Muslims are in control now in Afghanistan. Also the
<br>
best fighters were the most hard-core Fundamentalist Muslims, and
<br>
Afghanistan needed its best fighters for those 10 years of war.
<br>
Maybe what will emerge from the Chechnya war will be a similar
<br>
hard-core Fundamentalist Islam (I hope not).
<br>
<p>The Afghans were not at all fond of government handouts, and
<br>
their way of life during those hard times reflects some important
<br>
aspects of their thinking.
<br>
<p>In the refugee camps in Pakistan (where most of the refugee Afghans
<br>
fled), one had to be registered with one of the political parties to
<br>
get food rations. This means that people who were not members of a
<br>
political party who were unregistered did not get rations, and so,
<br>
those who were the most independent-minded, who did not want to be
<br>
defined by a party, had an extremely difficult time keeping
<br>
themselves and their families fed. I think that there were hundreds
<br>
or thousands of such folk.The Pakistan refugee camps were full of
<br>
Afghans who started every kind of little business- they were far
<br>
from &quot;passive recipients&quot; of aid and food. They were selling food,
<br>
Afghan hangings, carpets, brassware, clothes, mementos of the dead
<br>
Russian soldiers, etc. The Pakistanis complained that the Afghans
<br>
were taking their jobs, and the Afghanis' reply was: &quot;We are not
<br>
taking your jobs, we start our own businesses.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the Qur'an there are specific passages that refer to the individual.
<br>
This religion does try to strike a balance between individualism
<br>
and collectivism. It holds everyone personally responsible
<br>
and accountable to God. At the same time, it guarantees fundamental
<br>
rights to the individual.
<br>
<p>Some quotes about this from the Qur'an:
<br>
<p>&quot;God does not change the condition of a people unless they first
<br>
change that which is in their hearts.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Man shall have nothing but what he strives for.&quot;
<br>
<p>This note is beginning to be long-winded, and I have to get some work done.
<br>
I hope that I've made my point, however.
