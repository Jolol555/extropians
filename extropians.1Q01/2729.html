</em><br>
<em>&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-Promise Yourself -
</em><br>
<p>It was very good, but my warped sense of humor naturally causes me to 
<br>
invent pessimistic, bitter and sarcastic responses to each of these. 
<br>
Maybe I just like optimism in moderation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.
</em><br>
<p>I can smash beer cans against my forehead, so I must be right!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.
</em><br>
<p>Let me tell you how healthy, happy and prosperous I am!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.
</em><br>
<p>What's gotten into you?
<br>
or
<br>
You're full of something!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.
</em><br>
<p>Death, disease, famine and poverty have their good qualities too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To think only the best, to work only for the best and expect only the best.
</em><br>
<p>I think only the best.  Only the best is what I think of.  Only I 
<br>
think of the best.
<br>
I don't think of what is not best.  If I don't think of it, it is not 
<br>
best.  What other people think is not best.
<br>
It is best to think only what I think.  I think what I think is best.
<br>
You'd best think what I think.  You'd best think of what I think I think of.
<br>
You'd best think of what I think I think of, I think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about your own.
</em><br>
<p>You can be just as successful as I am if you do everything my way!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achievements of the future.
</em><br>
<p>I forget if communism worked or not.  Let's try it again for the future!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time to criticize others.
</em><br>
<p>I'm too busy thinking about myself to critique your responses to this post!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and too happy to permit the presence of trouble
</em><br>
<p>I'm too overweight to worry.  I'm distantly related to royalty so you 
<br>
can't anger me.  I can beat you up so I'm not afraid.  I'm in too 
<br>
good of a mood to listen to *your* problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;-The Optimist Clubs Of America-
</em><br>
<p>Too much happiness and optimism all at once sets off my bogometer. 
<br>
Even though I agree to all these goals in principal, I have seen 
<br>
people practice optimism until they go blind.  Blind optimism is as 
<br>
bad as blind pessimism.
<br>
<p>This post really is meant to be humorous.  These are good goals.  But 
<br>
I think a little optimism must be based on good science and facts 
<br>
that lead to optimism.  Inaction due to optimism is bad.
