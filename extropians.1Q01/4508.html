80 U.S. Nobel laureates back stem cell research
<br>
February 22, 2001 01:54:00 AM ET
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Stepping into a heated political and ethical 
<br>
debate, 80 U.S. Nobel laureates have signed a letter to President George W. 
<br>
Bush urging him to not block the first flow of federal grants for research 
<br>
on human embryo cells, the Washington Post reported Thursday.
<br>
<p>The letter, to be faxed to the White House on Thursday morning, marks the 
<br>
latest effort to influence the Bush administration as it decides whether to 
<br>
fund experiments on embryonic stem cells, the Post said.
<br>
<p>The letter comes three weeks before a National Institutes of Health 
<br>
deadline by which scientists must apply for the agency's planned first 
<br>
round of stem cell research grants, the report noted.
<br>
<p>Researchers say stem cells, taken from frozen embryos that fertility 
<br>
clinics were planning to discard, can one day cure a range of diseases from 
<br>
diabetes to paralysis.
<br>
<p>Opponents call the research immoral.
<br>
<p>But, according to the Post, the Nobel laureates say in their letter to Bush 
<br>
that given the cells' great therapeutic promise, it would be immoral not to 
<br>
study them.
<br>
<p>The letter was signed by such notables as James Watson, who won a Nobel in 
<br>
1962 for co-discovering, with Francis Crick, the structure of DNA; 
<br>
molecular biologist Hamilton O. Smith, who was a key player in the recent 
<br>
landmark genome mapping effort by Celera Genomics (CRA) of Rockville. Md., 
<br>
and Edward Lewis, the California Institute of Technology biologist who 
<br>
conducted seminal work on embryo development, according to the Post.
<br>
The letter was composed and circulated by Michael West and Robert Lanza, 
<br>
two scientists at Advanced Cell Technology Inc., a biotechnology company in 
<br>
Worcester, Mass., the Post said.
<br>
<p>Opponents of the research, including Douglas Johnson, legislative director 
<br>
for the National Right to Life Committee criticized the letter, the Post said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Just as war is too important to be left only to generals, the killing of 
<br>
human beings in medical research is an issue too important to be left only 
<br>
to scientists, even Nobel laureates,&quot; Johnson is quoted as saying.
<br>
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson has said he is reviewing 
<br>
the Clinton administration's decision to fund stem cell research, the Post 
<br>
said.
