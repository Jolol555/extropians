Subject: I'm really curious WAS-&gt; Re: The non-existence of posthumans
<br>
<p>Hi Justin
<br>
<p><em>&gt;i think that you have a point, that trans/post/neo/X whatever *human is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really just a case of definition.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;however, i'm a little confused. you invoke MVT a lot. But i don't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand how this is a powerful philosophy, or exactly how it does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things you claim it can.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;as i understand it MVT is just a theory that states that information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fundamentally different than physical structure. so in order to interact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with informative states, you need a non-physical structure, which is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neuroanatomical &quot;hole&quot; around where the median eye(or whatever you want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call it) used to be, before we stopped needing it to do what it does in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lower animals.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, like (non-physical) thoughts/sense data can only interact with
<br>
(non-physical) sensor(gan). This overcomes Leibnitz' objection to
<br>
Cartesian dualism so solves the MB problem ... but this is only the
<br>
start! MVT gives us a (more) complete evolutionary narrative for
<br>
animal intelligence/ consciousness. It explains the origins and
<br>
purposes of REM states and dreaming, and also tells us something
<br>
new about the brain considered as an electrical circuit/ neural wetware.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;okay.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;based on this, cetecarians(sp?) like dophins and such are conscious, or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least capable of being so. as well as a few other animals.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely, and not just higher mammals. *All* mammals and birds have
<br>
an E-1 brain (lost pineal eye, but kept pineal gland during Mesazoic cold
<br>
to warm-blooded interface). Most fish lost their pineal eye at an earlier
<br>
Devonian stage, and so are not E-1 in the same way.
<br>
<p>Our essential mental experiences (including the &quot;new&quot; indirect or
<br>
&quot;hallucinatory&quot; dreaming, and self (internally)-generated thought are
<br>
essentially the same as a cat, or even an eagle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;now where i get confused is when you say that MVT could produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind-control &gt;theorems, better hypnosis, that understanding it makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your psychology different than mine.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously MVT gives a different take on dreams (and meanings if any)
<br>
than, say, Freud's theories on dreams that are prior to the evolutionary
<br>
understanding of how dreams can occur.  Hypnosis has a history of
<br>
distinct stage from 'command' (hypnotist/ fluence) theory of Mesmer &amp;c,.
<br>
thru Braid, to 'standardised' hypnosis' (all hypnosis self -hypnosis, tapes,
<br>
absence of hypnotist), thru to 'advanced' or 'indirect' Ericksonian theory,
<br>
which is a balance between hypnotist and subject. MVT has allowed me
<br>
to extend the model to some new types of induction (which I am
<br>
not prepared to publish here).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;what insights does MVT give you on human psycho-anatomy that is not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;syncretistic of other discoveries. and if you really have a lock on this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why aren't you out there selling the results of this theorem, rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just the theory itself?
</em><br>
<p>Working on it mate ..... trying to get fund research into an MVT-based
<br>
&quot;conscious machine&quot; ....  any takers? If you want to experience MVT
<br>
oriented therapy and hypnosis, you will need to book appointment here.
<br>
I don't want to oversell the applications, would rather test them out first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;if you've really got something, people respond better when you show some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;results, and they ask how you got them, rather than just telling them the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basis for something they've never seen before. (hm, bad sentence structure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but i hope you get the gist)
</em><br>
<p>Yeh, am selling copies of the new documentary (VHS) as well as talking
<br>
to some terrestrial and cable broadcasters .... www.extropia.net
<br>
<p><em>&gt;where is the functional difference that occurs when you &quot;understand&quot; or use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MVT? what kind of advantages do you have over us non-adepti?
</em><br>
<p>Good question, which I have thought about. Of course you can drive a
<br>
car without knowing how the engine works. I just feel that fuller
<br>
information can't do any harm, and may be useful in certain situations.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip long reply to max more's post&gt;
<br>
<p>S&gt;MVT has been debated in depth on this list. The facts and claims have
<br>
S&gt;always been open to scrutiny and refutation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;out of curiosity, when was it debated, and who was involved? i imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eliezer would take umbrage at the idea that information processing on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order of consciousness requires imaginary objects, and a lot of people here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem to subscribe to the church-turing idea that all mindstuff can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computationally modelled.
</em><br>
<p>December 2000 thru Jan 2001 with philosophy academic Dan Fabulich.
<br>
Dan Fabulich &lt;<a href="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20I'm%20really%20curious&In-Reply-To=&lt;007b01c0a0f1$83c59360$919e403e@i6x7m6&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>And yes, he subscribes to the Church-Turing model, which I utterly reject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;anyway, when it was debated, how did it turn out? MVT seems a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophic for JR, and other people who like their houses nice and tidy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and certainly seems to violate occams razor to me, but then, i don't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know much past what i read on your website.
</em><br>
<p>I will dig out the last post I sent (still waiting for Dan to reply to it)
<br>
and repost.
