<em>&gt; In general, the market makes the best guess possible about the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be wrong either way, but on the average it will be as likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be wrong one way as the other.  This means that using futures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts will lead to prices that are, on the average, the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spot market prices. It does not save money.
</em><br>
<p>There's one particular piece of bad design that argues that long term 
<br>
contracts would help even though what you say is mostly true.  The 
<br>
utilities are currently required to buy all their power in a market that 
<br>
charges, each day, the highest price bid at any time during the day for all 
<br>
contracts.
<br>
<p>If 75%, for example, of the power sold each day weren't subject to this 
<br>
bizarre rule, because it had been purchased as a long term contract, then 
<br>
the power companies would be insulated from a significant source of up-side 
<br>
volatility.  There's no corresponding source of down-side volatility.
<br>
<p>The exorbitant prices that result from the broken market design are the 
<br>
sources of the charges of price-gouging that are flying all around.  There 
<br>
may have been some gaming of the system (I haven't seen any evidence or 
<br>
even heard that any exists), but the institution is designed so that any 
<br>
fluctuations in supply or demand inevitably drive prices up.
