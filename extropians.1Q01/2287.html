<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I see you deny the very concept of meaning being meaningful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This interpretation is probably not what you intended, but - you're entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; correct. There is no meaning. Even 'meaning' has no meaning, in a universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sense of things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually it is precisely what I intended.  Thank you for verifying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was seeing you accurately.  Now that I have, I bid you adieu.  I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing to say to philosophical nihilists as you have removed any means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of my reaching you any way.  I hope you get over it soon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's not a nihilist; he's simply following the commonest theory of rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the planet -- one that's used by just about everyone except Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who've been indoctrinated with their state's peculiar constitutional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory -- which is that rights are negotiated and conditional.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Is the nature of human being negotiated and conditional or is the nature
<br>
of human beings a given?  If it is a given then it just might imply that
<br>
certain rights, certain fundamentals of how people treat one another,
<br>
are fundamental to the well-being of human beings based on their
<br>
nature.  Yes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A nihilist would deny that there's any _point_ in negotiating with others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If there is no standard of reality like the nature of the entities we
<br>
are talking about to fall back on then negotiation probably is
<br>
pointless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You, for your part, appear to be as much a fundamentalist as a member of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Southern Baptist Congregations: you believe in some absolute underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Truths (either revealed by the Lawwd God Almighty, or the Singularity, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Human Nature(TM), or some other big source of revelation) against which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything can be measured. This point of view has its pros and cons, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you need to bear in mind that many other people see it as a blind spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for the insults.  They certainly make your point more strongly
<br>
than your argument did.  There is nothing mystical about the notion that
<br>
existing creatures, us, have particular properties rather than being
<br>
whatever society decides somehow to define us as.
