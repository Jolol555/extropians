<p>
(Sorry, I don't seem to be **quite** ready to let go of this topic :-&gt;).
<br>
<p>SPOILERS, naturally.
<br>
<p>I asked, somewhat rhetorically, in my earlier post whether the memetic
<br>
effect of _2001_ is what folks on this list would consider &quot;Extropian&quot; or
<br>
not, and mentioned that the appearance of the &quot;Star-Child&quot; (as it is
<br>
called in Clarke's novel) in near-Earth space at the end of the movie is an
<br>
example of an event-horizon Singularity, since the movie gives no clue as
<br>
to what's going to happen next.  Clarke's novel is equally noncommittal,
<br>
though a bit more explicit as to the power of the new entity.  In the novel,
<br>
the Star Child detonates one of the weapons in Earth orbit just in time to
<br>
avert a nuclear holocaust:  &quot;A thousand miles below, he became aware that a
<br>
slumbering cargo of death had awoken, and was stirring sluggishly in its orbit.
<br>
The feeble energies it contained were no possible menace to him; but he preferred
<br>
a cleaner sky.  He put forth his will, and the circling megatons flowered in a
<br>
silent detonation that brought a brief, false dawn to half the sleeping globe.&quot;
<br>
&quot;He had returned in time&quot; i.e., to save the world, which means that that he's
<br>
returned to Earth more or less around the same time that he left as Dave Bowman,
<br>
though the movie gives us no such clue.  Not even Clarke's more explicit
<br>
interpretation of the story tells us what's going to happen next:  &quot;Then he waited,
<br>
marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still untested powers.  For though he
<br>
was master of the world, he was not quite sure what to do next.  But he would
<br>
think of something.&quot;  The last page of the novel also observes that upon
<br>
the appearance of the Star-Child, &quot;Down there on that crowded globe, the
<br>
alarms would be flashing across the radar screens... and history as men knew
<br>
it would be drawing to a close.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Usenet group alt.movies.kubrick FAQ ( <a href="http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/kq.html">http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/kq.html</a> )
<br>
has links to some fascinating discussion that bears on the question of
<br>
whether or not the apparent evolutionary leap represented by the Star-Child
<br>
is really a symbol of hope for humanity.  Some people are persuaded that
<br>
Kubrick's own view of the matter, inferred from his entire corpus of work,
<br>
is that the Star-Child is likely to take human cussedness and moral failure
<br>
to a higher and more horrifying plane of evil (see &quot;Is the ending of 2001 really 
<br>
pessimistic? Optimistic? Either? Other?&quot; at <a href="http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q32.html">http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q32.html</a> ).
<br>
<p>On the other hand, whatever his expectations of the Star-Child in particular,
<br>
Kubrick's views about the long-term direction of life and consciousness in the
<br>
universe (from the _Playboy_ interview at <a href="http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q12.html">http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q12.html</a> )
<br>
seem impeccably Extropian:
<br>
<p>&quot;When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made 
<br>
in a few millennia -- less than a microsecond in the chronology of the 
<br>
universe -- can you imagine the evolutionary development that much 
<br>
older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from biological
<br>
species, which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal 
<br>
machine entities -- and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge 
<br>
from the chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and 
<br>
spirit. Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence 
<br>
ungraspable by humans.&quot;
<br>
<p>Finally, Kubrick has this to say about the memetic significance of
<br>
_2001_:
<br>
<p>&quot;I think that if _2001_ succeeds at all, it is in reaching a wide 
<br>
spectrum of people who would not often give a thought to man's destiny, 
<br>
his role in the cosmos and his relationship to higher forms of life.&quot;
