<p>As an Alaskan I must say I am not amused by your comment! ;)  The colder climes can allow for more time studying and reflecting.  Or at least more time to ski and play snowshoe softball.  
<br>
<p>I have only found one other extro list member who lives in my state.  But, he still happens to live a LONG way from where I do.  Maybe we will meet in person someday.

I'm in east Tennessee. I doubt there are many Extropians in Tennessee, but maybe Atlanta would be a good place for a southeast regional gathering
<br>
sometime.

<p>I nominate Eliezer for the Atlantatropians presidency.  :)  Greg Burch can give him pointers!   
<br>
<p>he continues:
<br>
I'd like to go to Extro 5--not much good sushi in TN--but it's a bad time for me. Maybe next time.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I am tired of saying, &quot;maybe next time.&quot;  I hope to make it this time around.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
