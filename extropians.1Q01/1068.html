<p>Sorry, I should have been more explicit: here's what I found interesting
<br>
abt that recent estimate. It supports the view that one answer to 
<br>
<p>`where are they' 
<br>
<p>*isn't* 
<br>
<p>`it's too soon for anyone else to be around, or at least noticable, since
<br>
the solar system happened at the earliest possible astrophysical point of
<br>
convergence of the necessary pre-conditions'. 
<br>
<p>I've been wondering for a while if maybe so many prior steps were required
<br>
to build an Earth-like planet that we might actually be the sod-breakers.
<br>
This estimate sez that's unlikely, and not just by tens or hundreds of
<br>
millions of years but by billions.
<br>
<p>Which surely does sharpen John's and Fermi's question.
<br>
<p>My guess: some killed themselves, the rest Spiked and went to heaven.
<br>
<p>Iain M. Banks agrees with the latter view, with modification to permit the
<br>
Culture and its non-Spiking pals, but that's really just a story-teling
<br>
device. In his new novel LOOK TO WINDWARD, he explains:
<br>
<p>==========
<br>
<p>Subliming was an accepted if still somewhat mysterious part of galactic
<br>
life; it meant leaving the normal matter-based life of the universe behind
<br>
and ascending to a higher state of existence based on pure energy. In
<br>
theory any individual--biological or machine--could Sublime, given the
<br>
right technology, but the pattern was for whole swathes of a society and
<br>
species to disappear at the same time, and often the entirety of a
<br>
civilization went in one go...
<br>
<p>To flourish, make contact, develop,  expand, reach a steady state and then
<br>
eventually Sublime was more or less the equivalent of the stellar Main
<br>
Sequence for civilizations, although there was an equally honorable and
<br>
venerable tradition for just quietly keeping on going, minding your own
<br>
business (mostly) and generally sitting about feeling pleasantly
<br>
invulnerable and just saturated with knowledge.
