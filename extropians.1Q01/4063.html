Some observations on near-future technological developments-

February 16, 2001 Second-half rebound D.O.A.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;And the balance sheet's red glare. . .  
<br>
Bombs went off last night in the form of earnings results,
<br>
preannouncements and future guidance. In no particular order, Dell
<br>
(DELL) missed its estimate, guided lower and said it had no visibility
<br>
to provide guidance for the second half of the year. ...   
<br>
<p>The bombs bursting in air. . . 
<br>
&nbsp;Analog Devices (ADI) lowered guidance for the next couple of quarters
<br>
and will be at the mercy of cancellations while trying to make its
<br>
revised numbers. Last, but most important, Nortel (NT) dropped a bomb by
<br>
saying it was going to lose money instead of make money, it was going to
<br>
lay off a bunch of people and allowed that there was not going to be a
<br>
recovery this year. Folks need to realize that when Nortel's business
<br>
gets this bad, that means the big carriers have cut back their orders
<br>
and suppliers to Nortel are going to have their orders cut back.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you add up the three big names previously mentioned you get more
<br>
than $100 billion in revenues, so ladies and gentlemen, this is
<br>
significant stuff. These are not itty-bitty companies that are having
<br>
problems. This will definitely back up the food chain in technology. As
<br>
I've been trying to state on a regular basis the last couple of weeks,
<br>
the most vulnerable equities are the chip stocks because of the
<br>
valuations and the fact that we're swimming in inventory at every level.
<br>
They're facing the possibility of having their orders literally go to
<br>
zero.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Note: there is a worldwide glut in DRAM, semiconductors (e.g.
<br>
microprocessors), telecom, wireless, electronic components, etc. sitting
<br>
in warehouses, a classic Austrian School malinvestment.]  
<br>
<p>To put it mildly, last night's information touched a wide range of
<br>
companies. On top of that we had a couple of other important
<br>
preannouncements, one from Schering-Plough (SGP) and another from Dow
<br>
Chemical (DOW). It's telling that we've reached the point where we're
<br>
starting to see estimates go from expected gains, to small losses, to
<br>
even bigger losses.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first couple of hours we pretty much went sideways with a
<br>
slight upward tilt in the S&amp;P and the Dow and a slight downward tilt in
<br>
the Nasdaq. It appears as though &quot;they&quot; (the proverbial they) were
<br>
trying to prop certain stocks to maintain psychology... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;[Note: &quot;They&quot; may be traders for the larger mutual funds, the Plunge
<br>
Protection Team (PPT: Fed+US gov), or maybe aliens.] 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I might add that, for once, an economic statistic showed up in a
<br>
dramatically unfriendly way, which complicated the picture this morning.
<br>
The PPI, instead of being up the expected 0.3 percent, was up 1.1
<br>
percent, which also helped cast a pall over things, although as I've
<br>
said in the past anyone who relies on government statistics to tell them
<br>
what's really happening with inflation is being a bit naïve.   
<br>
<p>[Note: the official CPI, PPI, GDP, productivity, etc. figures are 100%
<br>
statist propaganda, reminiscent of the Soviet Union. A 1.1% PPI should
<br>
probably be doubled for good measure, though it is more accurate than
<br>
most BLS numbers. Check out your local supermarket for the Incredible
<br>
Shrinking Package.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From there a sharp rally ensued, I suppose partially because Dick Arms
</em><br>
sent an e-mail to all his trader types indicating that at 3:20 p.m. EST
<br>
he was going on bubblevision [Note: CNBC] to declare that, based on his
<br>
35 years of his experience, the Nasdaq was at a bottom. ... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In the news, Ed Hyman of the ISI Group pointed out that when the price
<br>
of oil broke in 1980, the rig count broke one year later. And when the
<br>
Nikkei broke in 1990, Japan's economy started to break a year later.
<br>
He's pointing out that since the Nasdaq stock bubble broke a year ago,
<br>
this is about the time we should start to see some technology company
<br>
weakness. When one looks at it in the context of bubbles breaking, the
<br>
absurdity of the notion of this getting better by the second half
<br>
becomes very clear. ... 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Turn the lights down low. . .  
<br>
One of the reasons that I've harped on all the shenanigans going on in
<br>
corporate America, where they focus on the stock price instead of the
<br>
business, is because by doing that a lot of businesses have been hurt to
<br>
the point of ruin. There is no better example than Lucent (LU), which is
<br>
potentially headed to death's door because of trying to move heaven and
<br>
earth to make the number. All the vendor financing that went on, and not
<br>
just at Lucent, where companies that couldn't afford it were sold
<br>
equipment on credit so that &quot;expected&quot; sales growth and earnings growth
<br>
would be there, is now starting to blow up in everybody's face.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of hanky-panky that has gone on in this cycle dwarfs any
<br>
other cycle probably by a factor of 10. The fallout from this will be
<br>
very grave. Companies that took on debt in addition to balance sheet
<br>
voodoo are going to be the most vulnerable. It was particularly
<br>
remarkable to see IBM, for instance, only down $1.50 today. If anyone
<br>
thinks that company is going to get through this unscathed they're
<br>
crazy. IBM is in the same business as the companies that are getting
<br>
hurt right now, it has no protection from a price war and its balance
<br>
sheet is a disaster waiting to happen.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Note: Inflation/hyperinflation is the debtor's friend as long as
<br>
loans don't need to be rolled over. This principle also applies to the
<br>
largest debtor in history- the US federal gov. Motive and method are
<br>
established.]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps over the three-day weekend folks should take a step back and
<br>
think about what's gone on and the potential for problems. I think we
<br>
can be certain that the bad news will continue to escalate and it seems
<br>
as though folks are not prepared for it yet are determined to bet
<br>
against it. One of these days all hell's going to break loose and you're
<br>
not going to get a chance to sell them at anything remotely resembling
<br>
today's levels.   . . .
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to make a comment about trying to pick bottoms and tops.
<br>
Trying to pick the bottom is like trying to pick the top. By definition,
<br>
it's an extremely low-probability event because it can occur only once.
<br>
That's why I think it's particularly crazy to state, with any degree of
<br>
certainty, that the bottom has been reached. When we were chronicling
<br>
the craziness of the last couple of years, from time to time we tried to
<br>
describe what a top might look like just so we would be prepared if we
<br>
ever saw events surrounding that top.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We chronicled a number of blowouts and reversals that didn't turn out
<br>
to be the top, but at the time I tried to be careful to point out that
<br>
by definition it was a low-probability event and staking money on
<br>
guessing that was foolhardy. I would remind the bulls of the same thing
<br>
-- it's worthwhile knowing what a bottom looks like, but it's not very
<br>
likely it's going to be identified on the day it occurs, and it's even
<br>
less likely that it's going to occur so recently after the peak of such
<br>
a very large mania. &quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;============   
<br>
<p>The largest speculative mania in history, to be precise.      
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Greenspan has presided over the greatest money-supply creation in
<br>
human history. More dollars were conjured up (well over 4 trillion) on
<br>
his watch than in the entire rest of the history of the Federal Reserve.
<br>
This &quot;Credit Bubble&quot; is the underlying reason for the hyperinflation in
<br>
stock and real estate prices over the past few years. The rise in the
<br>
S&amp;P 500 1994-1999 for example, has a .995 correlation with M3 growth
<br>
over the same period.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade deficit is much of the reason for &quot;low&quot; price-inflation,
<br>
alleged productivity increases and rising GDP. We have been exporting
<br>
many (over $30 billion per month net) of the excess dollars -inflation-
<br>
and importing &quot;productivity&quot;. This one of those 800 pound gorilla
<br>
&quot;imbalances&quot; that Greenspan drones on about. The GDP increase is caused
<br>
in large part by re-pricing imports for sale in the US. That $30billion+
<br>
per month, when adjusted for a 220%+ purchasing power parity (PPP basis)
<br>
-the overvaluation of the dollar- is closer to $100 billion per month,
<br>
or something like one trillion dollars (in October, 2000 dollars) per
<br>
year worth of goods plundered from the world. This is the core of the
<br>
&quot;New Economy&quot; (a phrase coined in the late 1920's). We wire information
<br>
about &quot;money that never was&quot; overseas, in exchange for about half of
<br>
what you (meaning Americans) consume. That is the &quot;Information Economy&quot;,
<br>
for your information.
<br>
<p>A day unlike any other day-    
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An external devaluation of the dollar appears imminent. It can limit
<br>
down overnight, while you sleep, as happened with Apple and Intel and
<br>
the S. Korean Won. The dollar peaked November 24th and has since fallen
<br>
about 7%+- against most currencies. The Fed's panic drop of interest
<br>
rates the first week of January may have served notice of capitulation
<br>
in the Euro-Dollar currency war. This may have been motivated by
<br>
someone's (Bank of America?) derivatives book blowing up LTCM-style.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fed's choices are/were restricted to essentially two: 
<br>
1) attempt to cushion the &quot;hard landing&quot;. 
<br>
2) attempt to salvage the value of the dollar.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daevaluation may prompt foreign holders of US bonds, (44%ish are
<br>
held externally, the highest % in history. Here we disregard US bonds
<br>
held by the Fed, these are simply monetized government debt.), stocks,
<br>
dollar accounts, and perhaps even central bank exchange reserves to
<br>
divest themselves, setting off a panic not unlike a stock market crash.
<br>
This process appears to be underway now. Alternatively, this may lock up
<br>
the interbank system- a global, systemic failure. The resulting import
<br>
price-inflation (like with oil) in the US will be a central feature in
<br>
the economic &quot;soft landing&quot; (a retreat to low GDP growth) or
<br>
&quot;hard-landing&quot; (recession, defined as 2 quarters of negative growth) or
<br>
most probably &quot;collapse&quot; (a rapid reduction in GDP concurrent with
<br>
rising unemployment, etc. A recession speeded up.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognize that e.g. stock market capitalization is a &quot;notional
<br>
value&quot;, the $13ish trillion peak market capitalization (aka the &quot;wealth
<br>
effect&quot;) never existed. Money flows through the stock market, from a
<br>
buyer to a seller, it does not reside in the market. The entire US
<br>
economy runs on a bit more than $1 trillion (M1 or MZM). This can be
<br>
visualized by thinking of the US annual GDP of ~$10 trillion as being
<br>
very roughly a monthly circulation of the M1 &quot;money&quot; supply, plus
<br>
occasional parts of M3. External central bank holdings alone greatly
<br>
exceed M1, Eurodollars (US dollars held in European accounts) are about
<br>
½ of M1, and untold quantities of 'actual' paper dollars (well north of
<br>
a $half trillion) circulate externally.  Much of this is currently used
<br>
for international trade between non-US countries- but not because they
<br>
volunteered to grant such exorbitant privilege...
<br>
<p>A glimpse of the future-

<br>
ORO (01/30/01; 14:43:09MT - usagold.com msg#: 46961)
<br>
&nbsp;... there is discussion of displacement of local manufacture by imports
<br>
due to &quot;free trade&quot;. This is not true!  The actual cause is &quot;Triffin's
<br>
dilemma&quot;, which was actually discovered at least 3 centuries ago, and
<br>
possibly first formulated by Sir Gresham, the Exchequer to Elisabeth
<br>
some 450 years ago.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is simple, industry is destroyed at the source of money
<br>
creation.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in a country that has a wide variety of industries in the
<br>
days of the gold standard, and there is a huge strike of gold, with more
<br>
reserves found every year, then money (gold) will be spent by the local
<br>
owners, spent by the happy miners, taxed and spent by the local
<br>
government, and would cause an increase in money supply. Local prices
<br>
would rise well above those in other countries, as a result, the
<br>
country's exporters will find local labor hired from under them and
<br>
moving towork the mines or cater to the spending of miners, the mine
<br>
owners, and the government. The exporters, facing high costs and an
<br>
attractive local market would stop exporting. Next, import prices, being
<br>
lower than local prices, would cause imports to flow in, displacing
<br>
local production.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While artists, shop owners, and service providers might be getting
<br>
very well paid by the mine owners and their laborers for local services,
<br>
lavish shows, andconstruction of megalo-houses, the industrial
<br>
production of the country would decline and the mechanically inclined
<br>
local labor once employed in industry would have to convert to one of
<br>
the booming industries of housing, retailing, broking intermediaries,
<br>
entertainment, scientific research, spiritual and psychological advice,
<br>
medical service and medications, and government service.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This will continue until the prices of goods abroad rise to be closer
<br>
to the prices of goods in the gold producing country. When this happens,
<br>
the expansion of imports will stop, some imports will no longer be
<br>
cheaper abroad than when locally produced, and then local entertainers,
<br>
salesmen, government workers, home builders, brokers etc. will have to
<br>
find new employment in some of the old mainstay industries that now have
<br>
to be rebuilt from the ground up.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dollars:  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, instead of a mine being the source of money, let's look at the
<br>
source for today's official international money, the dollar. How and
<br>
where is a dollar created? Dollars are created by issuing debt - which
<br>
is done by borrowing for the purpose of spending, investment in capital
<br>
and technology development, or speculation - or it is done by &quot;printing&quot;
<br>
of it by the monetary authority, the Fed. Dollars abroad are not
<br>
borrowed into existence directly, but leveraged in what is a &quot;free
<br>
banking&quot; system - which is prone to liquidity problems when it expands
<br>
more quickly than the supply of dollars from exports to the US (the
<br>
creator of our &quot;gold&quot; in this case), because there is no monetary
<br>
authority to print dollars outside the US.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is thus destined to flow out of the reserve currency issuing
<br>
country, America. Aside from giving it away, the only other ways of
<br>
supplying money abroad is by lending it and spending it on foreign
<br>
investments and imports (produced by the investments abroad).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imports are destined to flow the other way and to destroy the
<br>
industrial economy by competition from imports, so long as dollars are
<br>
used to settle the most necessary trade (oil) by political fiat (an
<br>
agreement between our creditors, us dollar producers, and oil producers
<br>
that have our troops sitting around their oil), and there is a need for
<br>
more dollars abroad. The need for more dollars abroad is a result of
<br>
dollar debt incurred in the past by developing economies; both in their
<br>
attempts to buy oil in the 70s, and in their borrowing for capital
<br>
investment in local and exporting industries in the later 70s and
<br>
through 1994.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dollar exports overcome debt service costs to dollar debtors 
<br>
[Note: you are here.], 
<br>
the dollar will collapse as prices of imports grow to match US prices,
<br>
while import volumes drop and will start being replaced by local
<br>
production.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A demonstrative look at recent dollar history:
<br>
&nbsp;This is exactly what happened in the course of the development of the
<br>
dollar reserve system coming out of WWII. This lasted till 1971, when
<br>
the then exporters to the US, namely Europe, finally reached the point
<br>
where their loan repayments in dollars were completely supplied by
<br>
income from their accumulation of American income producing financial
<br>
assets, and the US suddenly found itself devoid of new oil, which had to
<br>
be imported in growing quantities - thus suddenly supplying more dollars
<br>
to the global markets. From that point on, there was no further need for
<br>
dollars in Europe, and they just dumped into the markets for real goods
<br>
those dollars they and oil producers got from exports destined to the
<br>
US. Import prices rose to the sky in the US, and &quot;free trade&quot; became the
<br>
mantra in order to lower import costs to Americans. Europe and oil lent
<br>
the money to emerging markets, and China suddenly started opening its
<br>
doors to trade. ...  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They [Asian &quot;tigers&quot;] will only be able to resume high speed growth
<br>
when China (and later India) can no longer offer cheaper skilled labor
<br>
or the costs of American distribution and retailing and export
<br>
transportation (oil to run the ships and energy costs to build new
<br>
ships) rises to the point of choking further export growth by eating the
<br>
price margin with the US. Alternatively, they can make a coordinated and
<br>
concerted effort to lower outstanding debts and raise reserves in
<br>
dollars till they no longer have to price their exports off of the need
<br>
for dollars for debt and oil. When this point is reached, they will not
<br>
need any surplus dollars from the US. The collapse of US energy
<br>
infrastructure is displacing production of US basic materials to these
<br>
same emerging markets, which will increase their dollar income more than
<br>
it will increase their production volumes. The 7% drop in their net debt
<br>
position is going to be a 10%-12% drop in the next period (assuming
<br>
stable oil prices under $40) just because of the replacement of
<br>
production from US basic industries.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When non-oil US import prices stop dropping, the signal will have
<br>
been given that the colossal debt trap of the past 20 years has been
<br>
breached and the captured economies are escaping. Oil prices will then
<br>
rise in tandem with other import prices going up, till the US is
<br>
producing enough of its energy to cap oil prices.   
<br>
<p>During the 70s and early 80s, the &quot;median American&quot; lost 25% of his
<br>
&quot;real income&quot;. This round will be worse. With luck, it may fall by
<br>
35%-40%, as production of import replacement capital and energy capital
<br>
will hopefully grow by the time the process hits bottom.   
<br>
========
<br>
<p>[Note: here we assume the federal government can be straitjacketed,
<br>
&quot;with luck&quot;. To illustrate, the recent political &quot;solution&quot; in
<br>
California is quite precisely incorrect, and will create an even greater
<br>
energy shortage.]  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When making calculations on the advancements of technology,
<br>
particularly as they may apply to one's personal situation, it is
<br>
required to include the fundamentals of economic science, a subject that
<br>
is unfortunately no longer taught in the US.
<br>
<p><p>Do you trust your life
<br>
savings to a computer disk somewhere-
<br>
money created and annihilated
<br>
at the flick of a pen
<br>
or the click of a mouse?
<br>
<p>Or would you prefer the kind of money that can only be created in a
<br>
supernova.
