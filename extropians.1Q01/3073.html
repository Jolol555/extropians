scerir wrote in reply to what ExI could do for us:
<br>
<em>&gt;A book. Very generous. About 500 pages. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lots of chapters. Lots of memes. A bible. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is a great idea!  For the moment I believe Damien Broderick's book &quot;The Spike&quot; could be considered fairly close to this ideal.  I have not yet read it, but get the impression based on what others have told me.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, I think this is a book to be written by Max More.  He has already written so many articles which could be fleshed out to help create a book.  Max has the knowledge and background to do this right.
<br>
<p>Of course, I could see room for collaboration.  Such people as Nick Bostrom, Natasha Vita-More, Anders Sandburg, Eliezer Yudkowsky, etc. could make very valuable contributions.
<br>
<p>I look forward to seeing this happen.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
