I agree with Barbara that it's important to recognize the valid points
<br>
and concerns that environmentalists have.   I also think that its
<br>
important to recognize that there is a wide range of people within the
<br>
environmentalist movement.  While Jeremy Rifkin's ideology may be so at
<br>
odds with our own that discussion with him would be fruitless, I think
<br>
that there are others with whom we can find  common cause.
<br>
<p>For example, I recently came across the context.org web site.  From the
<br>
introduction:
<br>
<p>&quot;Since its founding in 1979 by Robert and Diane Gilman,
<br>
CONTEXT INSTITUTE has explored how human society can
<br>
&nbsp;become sustainable (i.e. able to meet the needs of the present
<br>
&nbsp;without diminishing the prospects for the future), and has served
<br>
as a catalyst for voluntary change toward a more humane and
<br>
sustainable culture. We are one of a handful of organizations that
<br>
have focused on sustainability as a central theme for more than a
<br>
decade, and we are now internationally recognized as an authority
<br>
in this area.&quot;
<br>
<p>The site has all the back issues of IN CONTEXT magazine online, many of
<br>
which contain useful articles.  (See a sample article below.)
<br>
<p>It may be more productive to coopt the more reasonable
<br>
environmentalists, than to directly attack those like Rifkin.  (See
<br>
Gilman's article Finding Leverage for Change at
<br>
<a href="http://www.context.org/GROUPS/CW/paper.htm">http://www.context.org/GROUPS/CW/paper.htm</a> for reasons why you might
<br>
want to avoid direct confrontation.)

<p>The best business education: start your own business for under $100
<br>
<p>by William J. Larsen
<br>
<p>One of the articles in Living Business (IC#11) Autumn 1985, Page 12
<br>
Copyright (c)1985, 1997 by Context Institute
<br>
<p><p>Most of us are remarkably blind to the business opportunities that
<br>
surround us. Here are some eye opening suggestions from an
<br>
experienced small business educator and writer. Should you want
<br>
to dig any deeper into this well of ideas, he can be reached via
<br>
Life Success Systems, Box 1052, Bellingham, WA 98227.
<br>
<p>It takes no great insight to see that we are living in a time of rapid
<br>
change. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the world of work.
<br>
Five years ago, when I began giving seminars on self-reliance,
<br>
textbooks on the subject said that the average worker would face
<br>
three major career changes in a lifetime. I predicted five. Last Fall,
<br>
a Seattle newspaper article mentioned that the average worker
<br>
now holds a job an average of only 1 1/2 years.
<br>
<p>Our notions about livelihood are shifting, too, as are its patterns.
<br>
Roughly 85% of the people who work for money work for someone
<br>
else. They are employees. Psychologists estimate that perhaps as
<br>
many as four out of five (80%) employees are actively dissatisfied
<br>
with their jobs. Many people who come to me look to starting a
<br>
business as an alternative. They regard their own business as a way
<br>
to achieve happiness, to &quot;take charge of their lives,&quot; to
<br>
&quot;demonstrate their effectiveness in the world,&quot; to find
<br>
&quot;fulfillment,&quot; and an assortment of other laudable and lofty ideals.
<br>
The problem is: They have no background - and for good reason:
<br>
Their &quot;education&quot; has been devoted almost exclusively to
<br>
preparation for employment - to take orders and follow them, not
<br>
to take initiative. (Every public high school graduate has been
<br>
subjected to over 15,000 hours of conditioning for dependency.)
<br>
<p>The result is a general feeling that one's own criteria can't be
<br>
counted on (if indeed one knows what they are), that worthwhile
<br>
work is invariably dull, that deviation from standard behavior
<br>
involves &quot;risk,&quot; that failure nearly always involves penalties, that
<br>
organization is dictated by some Great Lesson Plan In The Sky,
<br>
that the &quot;average person&quot; is powerless, that it's useless to try to
<br>
change the System, and that it's &quot;cheating&quot; to look in The Back Of
<br>
The Book for help of any kind.
<br>
<p>The people I talk with are nearly all nice folks: Grownup
<br>
professional men and women between the ages of thirty and sixty.
<br>
They feel frustration about self-reliance (''What's going on?&quot;
<br>
&quot;What can I do?&quot;). They admit to ignorance (''How does anyone
<br>
get ideas?&quot; &quot;What works?&quot; &quot;How do I get started?&quot; &quot;What do I do
<br>
then?&quot; &quot;Where do I find experts to help me?&quot; &quot;Aren't they
<br>
awfully expensive?&quot;). They express fear: The oppressive and
<br>
pessimistic fear of failure (&quot;I know what to do, but I can't get
<br>
started.&quot; &quot;What if things don't work out?&quot;). The equally
<br>
immobilizing but optimistic fear of success (&quot;What if it works? I
<br>
want time for me, too!&quot;).
<br>
<p>On facing unemployment, personal stagnation, or simple
<br>
craziness, these folks may eventually risk asserting themselves,
<br>
find and read books and articles or watch programs on
<br>
entrepreneurism. In doing so, most become merely stimulus rich.
<br>
They remain experience poor.
<br>
<p>What is needed, I think, is a way to gather experience relatively
<br>
painlessly, free from the stresses we associate with Making A
<br>
Living or Going Into Business For Myself. One way is to play a
<br>
game. The game I suggest is: Start A Business on a Shoestring, for
<br>
under $100.
<br>
<p>Financial risk is minimal: the price of a couple of pairs of designer
<br>
jeans and a few dinners out. You know when you're winning: a
<br>
look at the profit/loss column tells all. As an identified game, it
<br>
can be played for fun.
<br>
<p>For starters, it helps to know the essential qualities of a successful
<br>
business idea.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) It should be something that interests and excites
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you. Whether it's running a beer can collector's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newsletter or setting up a fancy restaurant, you need
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heartfelt enthusiasm to keep you motivated long
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get established.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) A demand must exist or you must be able to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create one. Few people will buy what you have to sell
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simply to make you successful. They will buy what you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to sell if it will help make them more successful in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some way.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) It must be something you do well. If it isn't, you'll
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a hard time staying in business and if your idea is a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truly bright one, someone who does do it well will soon
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put you out of business anyway.
<br>
<p>Those are musts for any new business. Starting a business for
<br>
under $100 adds some extra challenges and requires ingenuity.
<br>
Here are twenty suggestions to help stretch your sense of the
<br>
possible:
<br>
<p>1) Put your idea in its least tangible form. Talk about it: sell,
<br>
lecture, consult, or give seminars and workshops. Run an
<br>
&quot;on-paper&quot; business: sell from a catalog made of illustrations
<br>
provided by wholesalers, solicit orders at in-home sales &quot;parties,&quot;
<br>
and have products drop-shipped directly to your customers.
<br>
Instead of building and selling houses, sell plans. Instead of
<br>
operating a cider mill, write articles about how to run one. Take a
<br>
tip from airplane manufacturers: build a prototype of your idea and
<br>
sell from it. Become a premium broker by finding well-made
<br>
crafts and selling large orders to be given away by banks, savings
<br>
and loan associations, and other companies.
<br>
<p>2) Make &quot;something&quot; out of &quot;nothing.&quot; Look for free raw
<br>
materials: surpluses, messes, problems, information, wasted talent,
<br>
unused space, garage sale leftovers, events which may act as a stage
<br>
for your idea. A northern California couple does well
<br>
manufacturing compost from fish by-products and sawdust, both
<br>
of which are problems that need handling in their area.
<br>
<p>3) Look for free help. Hard times can be the best time for starting
<br>
a business on a shoestring. The prospect of something is nearly
<br>
always better than the dead certainty of nothing. People with
<br>
leisure time are often willing to speculate and work with you if
<br>
there is the possibility of a payoff later. Check with your family,
<br>
friends, co-workers, churches, schools, social service
<br>
organizations, senior citizen and youth groups, organizations that
<br>
aid the handicapped or rehabilitated, and your potential customers
<br>
or clientele.
<br>
<p>4) Emphasize your personal value. Extra time, energy,
<br>
personality, and attention add value and make your product or
<br>
service distinctly yours. Use and capitalize on whatever makes you
<br>
unique and different. It's your &quot;signature.&quot; It costs nothing and
<br>
helps to create a special relationship between you and your
<br>
clientele. A lot of fairly famous business people have capitalized
<br>
on what others might regard as &quot;weaknesses&quot;: Col. Sanders' age
<br>
and snow white hair. Barbara Streisand's nose. Woody Allen's
<br>
wimpy appearance. Richard Kiel's size. Your most valuable
<br>
resources may be your appearance, style, imagination - even your
<br>
sleep patterns (Edison reputedly rested only a couple of hours a
<br>
day)!
<br>
<p>5) Concentrate on skills you already have. Employers nearly
<br>
always look for people to fill specialized spots. The chances are
<br>
good that your most valuable skills are not those which would get
<br>
you a job because they are too comprehensive. Tact, personality,
<br>
endurance, sense of humor, ability to get along with kids -
<br>
whatever. They may be of great benefit in a business of your own.
<br>
Many of us downplay ourselves by believing that if we can do
<br>
something everyone else must be able to do it, too. Clues to your
<br>
real abilities lie in your answers to such questions as:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I really do best?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have I wanted to do since I was a kid?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I enjoy most?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I do most easily?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most interesting to me?
<br>
<p>By concentrating on skills you already have you may discover you
<br>
don't need to do anything &quot;special&quot; to start a business for well
<br>
under $100.
<br>
<p>6) See your possessions as tools out of context. Possessions can
<br>
be facilities for doing more, not just rewards for what you have
<br>
already done. Your yard can become a display for your edible
<br>
landscaping service. Your kitchen equipment can act as a learning
<br>
center for young bakers. Your van can become a delivery/display
<br>
vehicle. An old barn can act as an indoor yard-sale. Catalog your
<br>
possessions. Many of them are miniaturizations of commercial
<br>
equipment. See them in that context.
<br>
<p>7) Value access. You don't have to own in order to use. A
<br>
workplace copy machine can print a short run of your manuscript.
<br>
School shop equipment can turn out a prototype of your invention.
<br>
Commuters can make deliveries for you. Your secretary may type
<br>
your personal business letters.
<br>
<p>8) Make up a need survey. Before you spend a dime, ask yourself:
<br>
What do I really need to start and operate this business? What else
<br>
will do? Where is it? Can I trade, borrow, or rent it? Purchase only
<br>
as a last resort. Be sure you don't confuse need with image or tools
<br>
with toys. Focusing on needs and tools will help you simplify and
<br>
clarify, making your organizational job easier.
<br>
<p>9) Work out of your home, head, or vehicle. By doing that, you:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut costs, commuting, and lunch time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminate duplicate rent, phone, electricity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can keep your present job.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control overhead by doing things yourself.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain a built-in family labor force.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimize risk.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can test before making a large commitment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain mobility.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can work hours convenient to you.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimize the need for and cost of special &quot;uniforms.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain space, utilities, and travel tax advantages.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminate long-term lease obligations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May integrate your work with your life and lifestyle.
<br>
<p>10) Avoid becoming an employer. Employers live in a world of
<br>
regulations, obligation, and often needless expense. Because of
<br>
Federal and state regulations, employees cost about 1 1/2 times
<br>
their contracted hourly wage. That cost goes on, whether or not
<br>
they are actually needed all the time. There are plenty of
<br>
alternatives: contract for piecework; organize limited
<br>
partnerships; trade; use part-time help agencies; pay commissions
<br>
instead of salaries; get your friends, church, or youth groups into
<br>
your act. Do everything yourself for awhile. You'll become familiar
<br>
with processes and their problems and get a firm grasp of what a
<br>
given job is actually worth.
