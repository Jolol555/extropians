<p><em>&gt; I was not writing to defend communism, but to point out that the one-liner

</em><br>
<p>I reread your post Hal, and saw nothing in there that would suggest
<br>
you were defending communism.  My own patriotic brain barf was
<br>
to answer your question as to why there is animosity between the
<br>
capitalist and the communist.  Im gonna take another swing at that,
<br>
but please be assured, my post was in no way a criticism of you
<br>
personally.  Your posts are among the best on this list.
<br>
<p>Why do commies and capitalists hate each other?
<br>
<p>The commie hates the capitalist because the capitalist is rich
<br>
and wont hand over the wealth, the stingy swine.
<br>
<p>The capitalist hates the commie because the commie represents
<br>
a very real threat of siezing his riches.
<br>
<p>Both are well justified by historical precedent.  People generally
<br>
wont give away their wealth.  Commies *will* seize the goods of
<br>
the Haves, and slay anyone who objects, if possible.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, I will give the communists credit where it is due: they
<br>
have done wonders with their rocket boosters.  When I see their
<br>
clever and robust designs, then remember they did all this almost
<br>
without the help of computers, well, I salute them, my hat is off
<br>
to them {the lousy pinko commie wretches}.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This means that, in a sense, the United States is as much socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as capitalist.
</em><br>
<p>I am fully and painfully aware of this Hal.  This is why I am no longer
<br>
a republican and now am proud to be a libertarian.  The libertarian is
<br>
the *real* capitalist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The long conflict between the USSR and the US was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ideological battle between capitalism and communism.  It was a power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggle between two socialist nations.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I agree.  This points back to your original question.  Looks
<br>
to me like the communists remain a threat in any democracy.  In
<br>
general, the Have-Nots outbreed the Haves, and therefor present
<br>
the threat that they will continue to vote themselves more welfare
<br>
until you have a socialist society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We should not be blinded by patriotic or ideological propaganda.
</em><br>
<p>My eyes are wide open.  Notice ----&gt;    {8-|
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  We live in a mixed society, part capitalist and part socialist.
</em><br>
<p>Ja, and I am unfortunately living in the socialist part.  As we speak the
<br>
so-called governor of Taxifornia is staging the seizure of property
<br>
from the utility companies.  As I warned a few weeks ago, this is
<br>
gonna get worse before it gets better.  spike
