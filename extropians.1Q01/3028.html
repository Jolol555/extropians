<p>Unacceptable. I suggest keeping one's identity a private matter by masking
<br>
the face when in public. [Reminds me of a science fiction story in which all
<br>
had masks with specific meanings which you had to live up to - apparently
<br>
written by a precog, it seems.]
<br>
<p>I would paraphrase thus:
<br>
<p>What is the difference between living in a small village and a police state?
<br>
<p>In a police state you are always in prison.
<br>
In a village you can leave it by moving to a city.
<br>
In the police state you have nowhere to run, I'm afraid.
<br>
The police Borg will not allow that.
