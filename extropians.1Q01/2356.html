<p><em>&gt;Question for Barbara: the article you forwarded says &quot;Sea levels were likely

<em>&gt;to rise between nine and 88 cm (3.54 and 34.64 inches) [by 2100]&quot;. Even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it were 88cm, this doesn't seem much for a 6 degree warmup - I've heard much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wilder figures than that.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know how the authors of the article reached their conclusions--I'd 
<br>
guess they're looking at the large portion of the world population living 
<br>
on low-lying lands near coasts. I didn't forward the article because I 
<br>
thought it was the last word on global warming. I posted it in response to 
<br>
Mike Lorrey's post to provide a different opinion. There are many different 
<br>
opinions about the weather, and no one seems to have a very accurate method 
<br>
of predicting global weather patterns. Models that work well for a couple 
<br>
of years will suddenly make all the wrong predictions for the third year.
<br>
<p>One of the most interesting popular science books I've read on social 
<br>
effects of global weather patterns is *Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El 
<br>
Nino and the Fate of Civilizations by Brian M. Fagan. Here's a review from 
<br>
*Scientific American*:
<br>
<p>&quot;The aberrant and often devastating weather patterns brought on by El Niño 
<br>
are by now familiar. According to Fagan, they have had a less recognized 
<br>
effect. &quot;There is a strong correlation between unusual climatic shifts and 
<br>
unusual historical events.&quot; He cites the fall of the Old Kingdom in ancient 
<br>
Egypt, the Moche society of Peru and the Maya of lowland Central America as 
<br>
examples. Other societies--the Anasazi of the American Southwest and 
<br>
today's San foragers of southern Africa's Kalahari Desert--have survived 
<br>
the impact of severe climatic stress. ...Those that fail are less adaptable 
<br>
because their thinking is too rigid for the circumstances. Fagan describes 
<br>
the mechanisms and effects of El Niños, La Niñas and other far-reaching 
<br>
meteorological events and then discusses how several societies have coped 
<br>
with them...&quot;
<br>
<p>Based on what I've read and what I've experienced first hand (having just 
<br>
lived through a period of drought worse than any on record [approx 120 
<br>
years] which was partially relieved by a flood worse than any on record), 
<br>
I'd think that the most challenging effects of global warming would be the 
<br>
increased volatility of the weather as the interconnected elements that 
<br>
determine global patterns&quot;try&quot; to adjust to a new situation. Shifts in 
<br>
population centers caused by increasing sea levels would add more stress, 
<br>
but I don't think this would be the main effect (although it would seem 
<br>
like a major effect to people whose land lost its value or whose families 
<br>
were wiped out by floods).
<br>
<p>BTW, my opinion about the source of weather change is that people are NOT 
<br>
the primary cause (although we certainly play our part, as do all 
<br>
populations of living creatures). I think in some respects we've tended to 
<br>
replace &quot;God&quot; with &quot;humankind&quot; in trying to explain that which we can't 
<br>
adequately explain otherwise.
