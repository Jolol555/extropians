Nothing that most of us don't already know, but here's a scary set of 
<br>
facts, considering the importance to us of continued and accelerated 
<br>
technical change:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/pagana/mg330/pfeffer.html">http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/pagana/mg330/pfeffer.html</a>
<br>
<p>If competitive success is achieved through people, then the skills of those 
<br>
people are critical. Consequently, one of the most obvious implications of 
<br>
the changing basis of competitive success is the growing importance of 
<br>
having a work force with adequate skills. Historical studies show that 
<br>
between 1929 and 1982, education prior to work accounted for 26% of the 
<br>
growth in the productive capacity of the United States, with learning on 
<br>
the job contributing to an additional 55%. It seems clear that &quot;learning in 
<br>
school and learning on the job are by far the most important factors behind 
<br>
American economic growth and productivity in this century, and will 
<br>
determine the nation's economic prospects in the next.&quot;(33) The evidence, 
<br>
however, is that skill problems in the U.S. work force are widespread and 
<br>
growing.
<br>
<p>Moreover, there is little evidence that U.S. employers, for the most part, 
<br>
are doing what is required to address this problem. Regarding the first 
<br>
point, the skill problem, an overview of training and preparation for work 
<br>
concluded, &quot;As we approach the end of this century, it becomes ever more 
<br>
apparent that the demand for more skilled workers is on a collision course 
<br>
with the quantity and quality of the labor supply.&quot;(34) In an article 
<br>
reporting the declining position of the United States in world trade in 
<br>
telecommunications equipment, the New York Telephone Company reported that 
<br>
&quot;it tested 57,000 job applicants in 1987 and found that 54,900, or 96.3% 
<br>
lacked basic skills in math, reading, and reasoning.&quot;(35) A human resource 
<br>
planning document prepared at the Bank of America in 1990 reported that 
<br>
&quot;Chemical Bank in New York must interview 40 applicants to find one who can 
<br>
be successfully trained as a teller&quot;;(36) &quot;at Pacific Bell in Los Angeles, 
<br>
95% of the 3,500 people who recently took a competency test for entry-level 
<br>
jobs not requiring a high school education failed&quot;; and &quot;at Motorola, 80% 
<br>
of its applicants cannot pass a simple 7th grade English comprehension or 
<br>
5th grade math test. At Bell South in Atlanta, fewer than 1 in 10 
<br>
applicants meet all qualification standards.&quot;(37)
<br>
<p>A U.S. Department of Education report covering document, prose, and 
<br>
quantitative literacy summarized the findings of a study mandated by 
<br>
Congress because of its concern about skill deficiencies in the work place 
<br>
and came to equally grim conclusions.(38) For instance, in 1986, only about 
<br>
50% of all high school graduates achieved literacy at a level that would 
<br>
enable them to follow directions to travel from one location to another 
<br>
using a map, and only 10% of the graduates could use a bus schedule to 
<br>
select the appropriate bus for given departures and arrivals.(39) Only 3% 
<br>
of high school graduates could orally interpret distinctions between types 
<br>
of employee benefits, and just 4.5% could estimate cost using grocery 
<br>
unit-price labels.(40) Assessments of mathematical proficiency are also 
<br>
distressing.(41) Almost one-quarter of high school seniors could not 
<br>
accurately determine the cost of a simple meal from a short menu of items 
<br>
and prices,(42) and fewer than half &quot;demonstrated a consistent grasp of 
<br>
decimals, percents, fractions, and simple algebra.&quot;(43)
