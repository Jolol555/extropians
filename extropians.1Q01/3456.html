It has been written (by Greg Burch) :
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;...a Carl Sagan seems to come along all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; too rarely.
</em><br>
<p>To which Barbara Lamar responded:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OTOH, long as you're still alive, it's never too late to start learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications skills.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The simple facts are that the kinds of people who are drawn into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and technical fields tend to be TERRIBLE communicators in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have an impact on the culture at large.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder why this is. Wish we could talk about this on the list and figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it out. It hasn't always been so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Even getting the people who could afford to fund the grooming of good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spokespeople to recognize the need seems to be an uphill task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is something the people on this list could begin to remedy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beginning with each person funding their own grooming (funding in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time as well as money).

<p>I have been thinking about this ever since I decided that a neuroscientist's
<br>
life is the life for me (hi-diddly-dee).  Though making a contribution to
<br>
the knowledge base (a ground-breaking theory or two would be nice, as well)
<br>
is very important to me, I also feel a great responsibility to further
<br>
science through communicating about it.  If it wasn't for Damasio, Dennet,
<br>
Pinker, Hofstadter, Davis, Gazzaniga, et al, as well as some excellent
<br>
professors here in the neuroscience department at OSU, I would still
<br>
probably be a disillusioned pre-med wannabe.  I very much want to be a
<br>
popularizer, to attract fresh blood to the science, as well as to inform
<br>
John Q. Public about the wonders of science, and what it can do (and has
<br>
done) for his life.
<br>
<p>That said:
<br>
How can I get there from here?  (ATTN: Mr. Broderick and other
<br>
writers/communicators on this list)
<br>
<p>So far, I have been voraciously reading whatever I can get my hands on in
<br>
the area of popular science (my reading back-log is horrendous).  I do this
<br>
not only for knowledge about the specific science, but with an ear to how
<br>
they communicate.  I have found Steven Pinker to be excellent in this arena
<br>
(his was the only non-fiction book I have ever read cover-to-cover in one
<br>
week, I usually jump around book to book).  At his advice, I'm looking into
<br>
Joseph Williams _Style: Toward Clarity and Grace_, which Pinker says is &quot;a
<br>
scientific style manual,&quot; in that it is informed by discoveries in
<br>
Linguistics in its attempt to create understandable and expressive prose.
<br>
If anyone knows how else I can improve my writing skills, I would very much
<br>
like your advice.
<br>
<p>I have also been reading fiction, both classics and modern, to discover how
<br>
they express themselves.  I consider the purpose of art to be expression,
<br>
and I would like to use what I can learn about expression from art to
<br>
enhance my expression in science.
<br>
<p>Verbal communication, in speech and debate, is one area I cannot seem to
<br>
find good information about.  I took a debate class, but it was less than
<br>
useless.  I would like to hone my speaking skills, and to that end I have
<br>
been making presentations for the Mars Society.  My major failing thus far
<br>
is that I have a low, soft, somewhat soothing voice, and it tends to put
<br>
people to sleep.  I do, however, consider myself to be a good communicator,
<br>
and I often can understand where the person I'm talking to doesn't
<br>
understand, and smooth out conflicts.
<br>
<p>I know that there are people on this list who are good writers and
<br>
communicators.  For me, and those like me, please share your thoughts and
<br>
resources on how we can better communicate our visions.
<br>
