<p>Hi Max,
<br>
<p>How much would Mr. Bailey's travel costs be?
<br>
<p>Note:  What follows is similar to a post I made earlier, though I hope that
<br>
there's enough new material to make it worthwhile reading.
<br>
<p>Rather than asking sponsors to back the conference as a whole, perhaps it would
<br>
be easier to ask them to back an individual.  In my opinion, it's more appealing
<br>
to sponsor a living person--Ronald Bailey, Wendy McElroy, John McCarthy--than an
<br>
abstraction like the &quot;Extropy Institute&quot; or an &quot;Exi Conference&quot;.
<br>
<p>By giving sponsors the opportunity to back specific individuals, you make
<br>
certain that, from the sponsor's perspective, the money goes toward funding
<br>
something that they fully support and wish to see.   It would also give you
<br>
feedback during the planning stages about who potential conference goers wish to
<br>
see most, thereby increasing your ability to make the conference as attractive
<br>
as possible.
<br>
<p>For example, you may wish to list the speakers you would like to invite, along
<br>
with with their corresponding travel costs.  Ask sponsors to send in money to
<br>
pay for that speaker's travel costs.  If you get enough sponsors, then invite
<br>
the person formally.   You could list the people/corporations who have sponsored
<br>
a particular speaker, along with how much they're donating.
<br>
For example, &quot;Ronald Bailey, brought to you by the generosity of the following
<br>
individuals and corporations...&quot;    Those who donate the most would get their
<br>
names listed most closely to the speaker's.  You could also offer the top 4-5
<br>
highest sponsors the opportunity to have  exclusive dinner with the speaker
<br>
after the conference.
<br>
<p>To reduce transaction costs, you could set a minimum sponsorship level of say,
<br>
$25.00.  You may also wish to deduct a non-refundable administrative fee (say
<br>
10% of the amount donated) to handle such a system.    (If you make initial
<br>
sponsorship levels relatively low, you can take advantage of the &quot;sequential
<br>
request&quot; effect--people are more willing to donate large sums, if they have
<br>
previously given small sums.   For example, someone who has given $25.00 one
<br>
year to sponsor a speaker, may be more willing to become a much larger corporate
<br>
sponsor in following years.   See
<br>
<a href="http://www.as.wvu.edu/~sbb/comm221/chapters/twostep.htm">http://www.as.wvu.edu/~sbb/comm221/chapters/twostep.htm</a>)
<br>
<p>If you don't raise enough for a given speaker (or the speaker can't make it for
<br>
some reason), give the sponsor the option of donating the amount to EI, applying
<br>
the donation to the next Extro conference, or giving them a refund.     Since
<br>
donors can ask that their donation be applied to future conferences, it may be
<br>
worthwhile to implement such a system now, even though you may not raise enough
<br>
for this year's speakers.
<br>
<p>I realize from your point of view, directed donations are less desirable, since
<br>
it reduces your flexibility to allocate funds where they are needed most.   And
<br>
no doubt setting up an Exi conference like this must take a ton of work--the
<br>
added benefits may not be worth the increased complexity right now.  This is
<br>
just some food for thought.
<br>
<p>P.S.
<br>
<p>In the &quot;Who will be there?&quot; section, you may wish to give the people there a way
<br>
to specify how likely they will be to be there e.g. (Will definitely be there
<br>
(have paid fees), planning to be there (but haven't paid fee yet), thinking
<br>
about going, etc...
