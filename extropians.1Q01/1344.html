Damien quotes Stewart Brand:
<br>
<em>&gt; `There are futurists, like Drucker, and those who pretend to be futurists:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *futurismists*, exuding *futurismo*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `Futurismists are not bad people, and certainly not fraudulent. If anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are captive of their goodness... Some hive off into sectlike groups,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the Extropians--a 01990s [sic; Brand's little quirk] California
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enclave of bright and enthusiastic Singularity advocates who could hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait for the techno-Rapture. They have a classic case of what Paul Saffo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls *macro-myopia*: &quot;we overexpect dramatic developments early, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underexpect them in the longer term&quot;.'
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we should be blaming ourselves for this.  Brand is at
<br>
fault here.
<br>
<p>Either he doesn't understand Extropianism, in which case he should not
<br>
resort to easy slurs, or he does understand it and disagrees, in which
<br>
case he should not knowingly support false stereotypes.
<br>
<p>My take on it is that he is supporting a philosophical position that
<br>
it is at odds with Extropianism, and that he has fallen into the trap
<br>
that says that the way to support your own view is to tear down those
<br>
who disagree.  By disparaging Extropians he attempts to make his own
<br>
ideas about the future more acceptable.
<br>
<p>It's a cheap tactic, reminiscent of some of the rhetorical trickery
<br>
employed by Bill Joy.  I wouldn't be surprised if they're buddies.
<br>
<p>And don't get me started on Danny Hillis.  Years ago I worked for a
<br>
parallel processing company at the same time that Hillis was running
<br>
Thinking Machines.  We worked our butts off trying to make real machines
<br>
that were useful on real problems while Hillis grabbed all the publicity
<br>
and a lot of the funding dollars with his impractical (IMO) designs that
<br>
required you to rewrite all your code from scratch.  They had these demos
<br>
that were completely misleading, trivial particle systems that gave the
<br>
superficial impression that they were simulating fluid flow but which
<br>
were useless in practice because they didn't handle viscosity and other
<br>
important phenomena.  Still, the demos looked cool, their machines looked
<br>
cool, and Hillis was a master of the press interview.
<br>
<p>Our company ended up failing and Hillis' company ended up failing, so
<br>
it doesn't matter much anymore.  But it was frustrating competitive
<br>
situation to be up against a company that was full of fluff and hype.
<br>
It leaves me with a predisposition not to be impressed with Danny Hillis.
<br>
<p>Now someone's going to forward this mail to Hillis or Brand, and we'll
<br>
have another flame war.
<br>
<p>Hal
