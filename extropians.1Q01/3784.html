This is related to several recent discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this weeks SCIENCE-WEEK EXPRESS:
</em><br>
<p>2. ARCHAEOLOGY: CLIMATE AND THE COLLAPSE OF SOCIETIES
<br>
.... ... H. Weiss and R.S. Bradley (2 installations, US) present a
<br>
review of current research on climate forcing of societal
<br>
collapse, the authors making the following points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The authors point out that the accumulation of high-
<br>
resolution paleoclimatic data that provide an independent measure
<br>
of the timing, amplitude, and duration of past climate events
<br>
relevant to societal collapse indicates that these climate events
<br>
were abrupt, involved new conditions that were unfamiliar to the
<br>
inhabitants of the time, and persisted for decades to centuries.
<br>
These climate events were therefore highly disruptive, leading to
<br>
societal collapse, which can be viewed as an adaptive response to
<br>
otherwise insurmountable stresses.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Examples of the relationship between paleoclimate and
<br>
societal collapse in the Old World suggest that prehistoric and
<br>
early historic societies, from villages to states or empires,
<br>
were highly vulnerable to climatic disturbances, and many lines
<br>
of evidence now point to climate forcing as the primary agent in
<br>
repeated social collapse. In the New World, high-resolution
<br>
archeological records also point to abrupt climate change as the
<br>
proximal cause of repeated social collapse.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Climate during the past 11,000 years was long believed to
<br>
have been uneventful, but new evidence increasingly demonstrates
<br>
climatic instability. Droughts lasting decades to centuries
<br>
started abruptly, were unprecedented in the experience of the
<br>
existing societies, and were highly disruptive to the
<br>
agricultural foundations of these societies because social and
<br>
technological innovations were not available to counter the
<br>
rapidity, amplitude, and duration of changing climate conditions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The authors point out that these past climate changes
<br>
were unrelated to human activities. In contrast, future climate
<br>
change will involve both natural and anthropogenic forces and
<br>
will be increasingly dominated by the latter. Current estimates
<br>
suggest changes will be large and rapid. Global temperature will
<br>
rise and atmospheric circulation will change, leading to a
<br>
redistribution of rainfall difficult to predict. The authors
<br>
point out that in spite of technological changes, most of the
<br>
world's people will continue to be subsistence or small-scale
<br>
market agriculturalists who are as vulnerable to climate
<br>
fluctuations as the late prehistoric and early historic
<br>
societies. Furthermore, in an increasingly crowded world, change
<br>
of habitat (&quot;habitat tracking&quot;) as an adaptive response will not
<br>
be an option.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) In conclusion, the authors suggest we must use current
<br>
information &quot;to design strategies that minimize the impact of
<br>
climate change on societies that are at greatest risk. This will
<br>
require substantial international cooperation, without which the
<br>
21st century will likely witness unprecedented social
<br>
disruptions.&quot;
