<p>
A bit ago, someone put forth the This-is-just-one-of-an-infinite-
<br>
number-of-universes argument, i.e.--no matter how unlikely life and 
<br>
consciousness might be, it HAD to happen SOMEwhere. Which, as I said, 
<br>
I think dodges the issue.
<br>
<p>I have found an amusing take on this, which I offer for your 
<br>
amusement (and my own)...
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an 
<br>
infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in which we 
<br>
live, most things we could possibly imagine and a lot of things one 
<br>
would rather not, grow somewhere. (A forest was discovered recently 
<br>
in which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit. The 
<br>
life cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit is quite interesting. Once 
<br>
picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed 
<br>
for years. Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its outer 
<br>
skin that crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable 
<br>
little metal object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and 
<br>
a sort of a hole for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. 
<br>
No one knows what it is supposed to gain from this...)&quot;
<br>
<p>This where the infinite-universes argument leads.
<br>
<p>Big Thanks to Douglas Adams.
