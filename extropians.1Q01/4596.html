Found this in Aerospace Daily.  Is this the first time in history
<br>
a machine has been armed?  spike

<p>PREDATOR FIRES HELLFIRE MISSILE IN FIRST TEST
<br>
OF WEAPONIZED UAV: The weaponization of Unmanned
<br>
Aerial Vehicles may officially be underway with a Predator
<br>
launching a live Hellfire missile in a test on Wednesday at Nellis
<br>
Air Force Base Range, NV. The test was conducted jointly by
<br>
the Air Force's Air Combat Command (ACC) and Aeronautical
<br>
Systems Center. In the live-fire test, Predator was commanded
<br>
via a Ku-band satellite link, out of the line of sight of ground
<br>
controllers. During this test - a fairly accurate representation of
<br>
how the UAV is controlled during real operations - Predator
<br>
used the &quot;Kosovo ball,&quot; an infrared sensor with a laser designator
<br>
attached to the aircraft so named because of its use in Kosovo.
<br>
The RQ-1A Predator flew to 2000 feet, lased its own target,
<br>
fired its live Hellfire missile and completely immobilized its target,
<br>
blowing the track off a tank. While the missile hit &quot;a few inches&quot;
<br>
below an inert previous shot that morning, the Air Force still
<br>
deemed the mission a terrific success, as it marked the first time
<br>
ever a UAV had fired a live weapon, the ACC spokesman said.
<br>
A weaponized Predator, the brainchild of Gen. John P. Jumper,
<br>
ACC's top commander, is being tested to examine the feasibility
<br>
of using a UAV to fire missiles.
