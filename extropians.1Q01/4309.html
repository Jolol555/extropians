<p><em>&gt; We occasionally discuss a different concept for dividing the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to reduce its power, sometimes called &quot;Privately Produced Law&quot; or PPL.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Bruce Benson (in The Enterprise of Law) and David Friedman (in The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Machinery of Freedom) are two authors who have explored this possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in detail.  It can be thought of as a form of horizontal segmentation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  government.  Instead of one police force, there would be many; instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of one legislature, there would be multiple ones, each creating their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  own constellation of laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Of course such segmentation already exists in the world, but strictly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  along geographic lines.  The idea explored by these authors is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  allow competition to exist within a geographic region among multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  governments.  Each person could choose which government's laws to follow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  they would pay whatever taxes that government specified, and they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  then receive whatever protection it was able and willing to provide.
</em><br>
<p>Hal, you make an interesting proposal below, but I thought I'd pick a nit 
<br>
first.  With the federal system in the US we actually have both horizontal 
<br>
and vertical segmentation.  In theory the subject matter regulated by federal 
<br>
and state governments and their legal systems shouldn't overlap much, but if 
<br>
they didn't at least have the potential to, my life would be a lot easier.  
<br>
In fact, with &quot;diversity&quot; jurisdiction for the federal courts, we actually do 
<br>
have a surprising degree of overlapping subject matter between two fully 
<br>
articulated court systems, although the applicable law is supposed to sort 
<br>
itself out in a way so that only federal or state law will apply on an 
<br>
issue-by-issue basis, even in cases subject to diversity jurisdiction.  The 
<br>
same happens in many instances with state, county and municipal jurisdictions 
<br>
for various different kinds of issues.
<br>
<p>This has in fact led to some &quot;competition&quot; within the same geographic region, 
<br>
although the competition doesn't work itself out in a market, as Friedman and 
<br>
Benson have proposed.  Instead, it plays out with evolving legislative 
<br>
accommodation between the different governments, with some judicial 
<br>
interpretation of questions of overlapping subject matter jurisdiction.  The 
<br>
most acute example that comes to mind here is the invasion of regulation of 
<br>
commercial matters by federal law that began in the 1880s and continues on 
<br>
into the current era, punctuated by a famous series of cases in which the US 
<br>
Supreme Court reinterpreted the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution to 
<br>
legitimize this trend.
<br>
<p>All of this is fresh in my mind because last week I hosted a Chinese trade 
<br>
delegation here that was studying US commercial law as part of their 
<br>
accession to the WTO.  I relished explaining to them the complexity of the 
<br>
whole system and that it was INTENDED to be inefficient in the sense of 
<br>
limiting any government or branch of government from having too much power 
<br>
over the lives of individual citizens.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  With horizontal segmentation, we could safely allow vertical integration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  There would no longer be a need for a government to have independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  legislature, executive and judiciary.  If various governments compete
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for citizens, they may choose to organize themselves internally in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  way they desire.  Efficiency, rather than limitation of power, would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the guiding principle.
</em><br>
<p>This is an interesting idea and one with which we'd have a chance to 
<br>
experiment in a society that really treated law as a commodity.  I think 
<br>
there's a natural efficiency in separating at least some legislative 
<br>
functions from the everyday work of initial dispute resolution, if for no 
<br>
other reason than that the latter is so time-consuming and requires 
<br>
specialized skills and close and constant attention.  I also think it's 
<br>
probably a Bad Idea to have the cop on the beat engaging in rule-making.  
<br>
However, we might see an interesting hybridization of the appellate judiciary 
<br>
and the legislative functions.  Come to think of it, this WAS the original 
<br>
model of the English constitution (yes, they have a constitution - they just 
<br>
don't capitalize the word because it's not all in one document), with the 
<br>
upper house of the legislature also doing duty as the ultimate appellate 
<br>
tribunal.
