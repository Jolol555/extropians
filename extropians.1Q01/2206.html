<p>Do you remember The Professor in Conrad's _The Secret

Agent_?  He whose pocketed left hand always grasped the
<br>
ignite-on-release detonator of the charge strapped around
<br>
his waist?  How calm, how correct, how cordial, were his
<br>
relations with the police!  And had Verloc not been such a
<br>
cowardly shit, but had carried his own bomb to its
<br>
destination, how much brighter would Winnie's life have
<br>
been, and how much closer the dawn of the New Order?
