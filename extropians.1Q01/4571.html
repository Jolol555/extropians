</em><br>
<p>No conspiracy.  Local news always devote more time to in-state issues 
<br>
than national news.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Incorrect, there is a federal law that specifically states that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;military absentee ballots do not require postmarks.
</em><br>
<p>Reference, please?  One of the many complaints about this election is 
<br>
that there were no uniform standards.  Each state set their own 
<br>
rules.  As far as I know, only Florida election law was used to 
<br>
regulate this election.  That was part of why the Supreme Court was 
<br>
hesitant to get involved and kept throwing everything back to the 
<br>
Florida Supreme Court.  I would like to see a reference to any 
<br>
federal law that described ballot requirements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It seems like there are a number of problems to be corrected.
</em><br>
<p>Definitely!  The real scandal here is not that this election was so 
<br>
screwed up, but that all elections work this way.  All military votes 
<br>
have been historically thrown out because of missing postmarks.  Some 
<br>
counties historically have 50% throw-away ballots where the machines 
<br>
don't work while reading them.  Absentee ballots are routinely 
<br>
ignored because the election would already be decided by the time the 
<br>
absentee deadline came up later.  Write-in votes are routinely 
<br>
ignored because there was never any chance of write-in candidates 
<br>
effecting the election outcome.  Most counties never even try to 
<br>
count the write-in votes, even for the major candidates, because it 
<br>
never mattered before.  (This is where many uncounted ballots are 
<br>
coming from.
<br>
<p>Nobody cared about these problems until we had an election that was 
<br>
close enough that the margin of error was greater than our ability to 
<br>
count.  Basically the Supreme Court ruled that we had run out of time 
<br>
and we couldn't take the time to count all the votes properly.  The 
<br>
system not only failed, but apparently it routinely fails.  One of 
<br>
the lawsuits about voting irregularities was dismissed by a Florida 
<br>
judge on the very grounds that all these occurrences are normal and 
<br>
were known to have occurred in previous elections.  He ruled that 
<br>
nothing unusual happened here and that the election occurred 
<br>
routinely as expected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is my mistake for not being clearer. I was referinng to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who called in saying they had accidentally voted for Buchanon (sp?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this number was something like three times the total number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;votes received.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this.  With all the reporting occurring, people were 
<br>
unsure if they voted correctly or not.  Even people in other counties 
<br>
that did not have the confusing ballot were convinced that they voted 
<br>
for the wrong person.  There is no way to count this accurately after 
<br>
the fact, and unfortunately, nobody kept records of complaints during 
<br>
the election day.  Although we know there were enough complaints to 
<br>
cause signs to be posted and replacement ballots to run out, but 
<br>
nobody knows how many ballots were screwed up after that.
