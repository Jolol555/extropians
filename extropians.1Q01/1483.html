<p><em>&gt;More like a thousand years weary, jaded, tired, bored, suicidal.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It's not even interesting being pretty and strong if everybody is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty and strong.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A thousand years wise might mean something.  What, remains to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen.  The fiction writers so far assume a great interest in either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aesthetics or history in coming Methuselah.  Might be.
</em><br>
<p>Longevity is hardly a new pursuit (read the Yellow Emperor's Classic
<br>
of Taoist medicine). The founder of the Rosicrucian's (Christian 
<br>
Rosencreutz) reputedly lived 5 or 600 years, and there is a tradition
<br>
of magickal adepts and alchemists living an incredibly long time.
<br>
<p>Enoch (or Edris of the Jin) who 'lived with God and was not' also
<br>
lived for 700 odd years ... and presumably passed his magickal 
<br>
skills to his son Methuselah .... I read the Book of the Secret of Enoch
<br>
for clues, but the jury is out on whether I can clock up as many years as
<br>
Enoch. But I am sure that there is a mental/ Will component to 
<br>
longevity ... some personalities will get bored or depressed and want to
<br>
top themselves, others will not. 
<br>
<p>I have put 2 recordings of the Enochian Calls at: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.multi.co.uk/Enochian.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/Enochian.htm</a>
<br>
The Call of the 30 Aires strikes me as very post-human, even anti-human!
<br>
<p>Most of us aren't at the cutting edge of bioscience so can't do much
<br>
practically about life extension, but anyone can work on low-tech 
<br>
life extension and personal health/ psychology. Technology isn't the
<br>
only evolutionary route, just one of several to be explored.
<br>
<p>I think  that meditational skills would probably be useful to gain control
<br>
over heart-rate, slow breathing, and overcome boredom ....
