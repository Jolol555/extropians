<em>&gt; &gt; It's one thing to talk about the future of the West, about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the new technologies and what opportunities they will bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to those of us wealthy and fortunate enough to be participating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on this mailing list.  But let us not forget that &quot;most people&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are unlike us.  It's going to be a much longer road for them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to share in the bountiful future we hope to see.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, with the following comments:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Whatever needs to be done, once someone has done it, it is a lot easier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for others to follow. Example paves the way. It will be easier to show the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eastern guys that our lifestyle is good once it is *actually* good. At this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, many of those eastern guys might argue that they have nothing to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the western civilization: &quot;Just look at yourself, what do you do all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day? Sure you're clean, sure you've got gadgets, but how are you any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy than we are?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Compared to what they have it IS already good and has been for
<br>
sometime.  People in these countries largely know this.  We do not.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - If you manage to motivate those eastern guys by example, by showing them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we have achieved something that they really desire, then, once people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are motivated, the road need not be long at all. Laws of slow change apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an idle, non-motivated society. I think that if you managed to show all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of India something that would motivate all of them to strive towards a goal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would be able to have them get there very quickly. [Or so I think.] Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compare this to conductors: you can't nearly put as much power through a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semiconductor as you can through a superconductor. Yet the difference is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primarily in the internal order within the material.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Believe me, the suffering in India and the hope of better material
<br>
conditions is HUGELY motivating.  What is the problem is a lot of
<br>
inertia and graft that is difficult to get beyond and a lot of
<br>
illiteracy and superstitious belief systems.  This is not so easily
<br>
overcome even with a lot of motivation.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason I am saying this is because some people tend to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'perfectionist' approach: let's make sure everything is nice and correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now, and then we'll figure out what to do next. &quot;Let's not go to Mars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until we have Earth figured out.&quot; I think that's the wrong approach; by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time we have Earth figured out, it might be too late.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It is not that for me.  It is more practical of how we will finance the
<br>
escapade, how it will become self-supporting and whether it will
<br>
actually do what we would like it to do as far as being a &quot;backup&quot; for
<br>
instance.
