<br>
<p>D&gt; I clearly didn't mean 2-4 when I said that principles were arrays of
<br>
D&gt; symbols.  (And, hey, if you'd had some charity, maybe you could have
<br>
D&gt; seen that.  This is an area where bad ethos will get you in trouble.
<br>
D&gt; Seriously, try to engage with respect and empathy.  Try to figure out
<br>
D&gt; how I could possibly be right.  You just might figure out what I meant
<br>
D&gt; for a change.)
<br>
<p>J&gt;Whilst skimming, I stumbled across your above passage, and I must confess:
<br>
J&gt;it gave me pause: it reflects a sentiment I too have held on not
<br>
infrequent
<br>
J&gt;occasion.
<br>
<p>J&gt;We are all guilty, perhaps, of bad ethos, or rather, we are heavily given
<br>
to
<br>
J&gt;engaging each other as antagonists-- it is oft times more important for us
<br>
J&gt;to be perceived as right rather than to illuminate rightness.
<br>
<p>Hi Dan &amp; Jason,
<br>
<p>I am as worried by bad arguments as bad ethos (which I deny utterly
<br>
by the way) .... and I will ruthlessly pursue the same to destruction.
<br>
This is not a personal thing, I am totally detached, as when I play in
<br>
chess tournaments .. win the game first, have a drink with the loser in
<br>
the bar afterwards.
<br>
<p>J&gt;It is very natural, and very human, especially for us damnable eggheads.
<br>
<p>J&gt;However, in our continual scrambling for rightness, we pave over the
<br>
J&gt;synergies we are capable of creating through collaborative effort.
<br>
Indeed,
<br>
J&gt;strangely, positive feedback appears to extinguish conversation in this
<br>
J&gt;mailing-list environment-- competition gives rise to far more dynamism.
<br>
I'm
<br>
J&gt;certain the longest and most recurring threads are those that are the most
<br>
J&gt;contentious.
<br>
<p>Jason, if you have been following this thread you would realise that
<br>
several topics have already been &quot;agreed&quot; or abandoned as
<br>
pointless (free-will vs determinism &amp;c.) and what is left are a few
<br>
core issues which are not resolvable by synergy ....
<br>
<p>J&gt;It would be interesting, I think, if we were more often able to expend
<br>
some
<br>
J&gt;energy in pursuit of uplifting the arguments of others.  Never fear, I'm
<br>
not
<br>
J&gt;talking about suspending skepticism, but, rather, seeking rightness.  We
<br>
J&gt;might more often cash in on the benefits of collaboration-- one need only
<br>
J&gt;look to the markets to see the benefits of enhancing local collaboration
<br>
J&gt;whilst maintaining aggressiveness in the macro-dynamic.
<br>
<p>The markets, since you draw attention to them, are a prime example of
<br>
companies marketing their own particular brands in direct competition.
<br>
Occasionally there are collaborations, more often takeovers, and in
<br>
fact I wondered why Dan persists with defunct computational analogies
<br>
when I suggested MVT offers a much richer vein topursue as his senior
<br>
project.
<br>
<p>The markets, in order to keep fresh and dynamic, also demand bankruptcies
<br>
and closures. Conventionalist philosophy is bankrupt, and I intend to
<br>
foreclose
<br>
in order tosave future generations of students from wasting big tranches
<br>
of their fee cash and time.
<br>
<p>J&gt;I am deeply in favor of individual empowerment, but also recognize the
<br>
value
<br>
J&gt;of compromise in the face of holistic goal achievement.
<br>
<p>Yes, but we are trying for truth-statements, not a compromise for the
<br>
sake of it. I claim that MVT answers various philosophical problems
<br>
although the answers are new, and not what academic philosophers
<br>
are looking for exactly, since they have a vested interest in keeping the
<br>
debate running ..... their jobs depend on perpetuating problems, not on
<br>
solving them).
<br>
<p>J&gt;Ok, so now my 2001 resolution with regard to this list is to spend just
<br>
J&gt;a -wee- bit more time seeking out my opponent's rightness.  Even better:
<br>
J&gt;lets find a way to turn that approach into a positive attractor state with
<br>
J&gt;regards to the volume of our dialogue.
<br>
<p>Sure, I welcome any feedback on MVT, critical or otherwise, which throws
<br>
new light on the issues and helps this field to make progress. But it
<br>
is also important to refute wrongs and linguistic obfustification, even if
<br>
this means hitting at peoples' cherished beliefs and self-image reliant on
<br>
particular bits of their internal dialogue. Dan was inaccurate to accuse me
<br>
of name calling, but I apologise if I have caused anyone emotional turmoil
<br>
by challenging deeply held convictions. Another strand of our discussion is
<br>
about whether &quot;will&quot; plays any role in philosophical argument, and what
<br>
&quot;rules&quot;
<br>
if any exist. Dan's play for sympathy as 'underdog' is quite legitimate ...
<br>
but I won't be diverted from my search for truth, or roll over like a wuss!
<br>
<p>My www.att.ac magazine for academic reform is appearing in paper
<br>
format now, and I am ramping up the campaign for closure of Philosophy
<br>
departments .... Leeds Univ. in particular ... as well exposing bribery
<br>
scandals in Eastern European academia, plus ways that UK admissions
<br>
for Master's courses are being conned by fake overseas first degree
<br>
references, and so on. Any other news items of academic malpractice
<br>
or areas needing reform, please contact <a href="mailto:steve@multisell.com?Subject=Re:%20Placebo%20effect%20not%20physical&In-Reply-To=&lt;001701c07761$8998cf00$20b1403e@i6x7m6&gt;">steve@multisell.com</a>
