Robin writes, quoting Hal:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;My view of this is that it doesn't matter that much whether our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;descendents are meat or metal.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If most people have never looked at things this way, I believe it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because they have never been presented with the argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK.  Imagine we take a focus group of twelve random adults in the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and let you have them for eight hours, during which you will present your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument, some capable opponent will present an opposing view, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will discuss it among themselves, etc.  What fraction of them will then a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gree with you at the end?  I'd bet it would be six or less.
</em><br>
<p>Very likely.  In fact if as many as six of twelve came to agree that it
<br>
didn't matter whether our descendants are meat or metal that would be
<br>
a remarkable rate of conversion.
<br>
<p>However my point wasn't that people were ready to be persuaded; it will
<br>
take many years for most people to get used to the idea.  And of course
<br>
the issue is basically irrelevant now since there are no AIs around.
<br>
<p>My goal in trying to present these ideas to people would be more modest,
<br>
that people would no longer view the position as laughable or worthy
<br>
of scorn.  Even if they don't agree, they would be more open to the idea,
<br>
and they would have a greater understanding of the principles behind it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is an experiment that can be done now for a few thousand dollars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at most.
</em><br>
<p>In fact every copy of Mind Children sold is something of a test of the
<br>
same idea.
<br>
