<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; some have speculated, &quot;free basics&quot; might come with some strings 
</em><br>
attached.
<br>
<em>&gt; ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Exactly.  Free basics in exchange for non-reproduction.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  free food would contain birth control medications.  Everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  wins: society could offer educational benefits, shelter, food, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  name it, and even the conservative element would gain some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  enthusiasm.  The medications would be non-permanent, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  if the recipients get with it and row their own boat, then they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can after a few months bear litters of pups.  What we still need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is a medication that makes the men temporarily sterile.  Ive heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  such a thing exists, dont know the details.
</em><br>
<p>Last point first: I think male contraceptives are in clinical trials now.  
<br>
The bigger point: Spike, I think the idea you propose would be perceived as 
<br>
very &quot;inhuman&quot; and, even in a relatively free world, would be unworkable.  
<br>
Most people perceive procreational rights as fairly fundamental to human 
<br>
dignity.  Trading survival for giving up those rights would be understood by 
<br>
many as a &quot;devil's bargain&quot;.  Beyond this, given the ethnic concentrations of 
<br>
hunger in the world, it would likely also be characterized as &quot;genocidal&quot;.  
<br>
However, if there was even a little benefit accruing to the distributors of 
<br>
&quot;free&quot; food (which was the point of my comment), then I think those who 
<br>
DIDN'T include contraceptives would quickly become the preferred providers.
<br>
<p>I think the wiser course would be to include a little education with the food 
<br>
packages.  This is why I so consistently oppose the idea that proselytizing 
<br>
for Enlightenment values is somehow an &quot;imperialist&quot; act.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Actually, when you think it over, we could remake prison colonies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  this way, for those who are serving life terms.  Delete the death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  penalty, create a prison colony where men and women can live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  together in a roach-motel kinda city, difference being everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  there is sterile.  Im sure the prisoners would opt for it in a second.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The main hitch is that there are probably at least 20 to 1 men to women
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  doing life.  That colony would be worse than the Silicon Valley.
</em><br>
<p>As others have pointed out, the inherent gender-inequality of criminal 
<br>
behavior defeats this idea.  At least in &quot;natural&quot; humans, there will always 
<br>
be far more young male offenders than female ones, no matter how you define 
<br>
crime.  That said, I personally think reform of contemporary criminal law and 
<br>
penal systems ought to be a top priority of anyone with even a shred of 
<br>
empathy for the suffering of others.  In the US at least, the criminal law 
<br>
and penal systems are horribly broken and counterproductive.
