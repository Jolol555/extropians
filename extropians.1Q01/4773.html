<em>&gt; I felt insulted and, to be honest, pretty deeply hurt.  My impression was

</em><br>
<p>This is painful even to read about, but it really isn't surprising.
<br>
My impression of the question-and-answer routine following public talks
<br>
by intellectual celebrities is that the purpose is by no means
<br>
to permit a genuine engagement by the questioner, but to stage the
<br>
merest appearance of a conversation by allowing the questioner
<br>
a brief sound bite (one or two sentences, at most) followed by a brief
<br>
response whose content is entirely at the discretion of the authority
<br>
(and need not even address the question), at which point the questioner's
<br>
time is up.  It's part of the technique by which the speaker (and
<br>
the conference organizers) keep **control** of the audience, and
<br>
isn't far removed from the way radio talk-show hosts treat their
<br>
callers.
<br>
<p>I suspect that public speakers are more-or-less required to learn
<br>
this sort of callousness, in order to be effective at what they do,
<br>
and to satisfy the folks who hire them.  I saw an example of this
<br>
from none other than Ray Kurzweil at last summer's PC Expo in New
<br>
York, following a talk that was basically the same as his new
<br>
Web article.  During the question period, a sweet elderly woman
<br>
came up to the microphone, asked her question, got an answer that
<br>
was not apropos to the question she had tried to ask, started to
<br>
rephrase, and was brusquely dismissed by Kurzweil, who said
<br>
&quot;can you give the next person a turn, please&quot;.  It left a
<br>
distinctly sour impression which has become a permanent part of
<br>
my internal representation of Mr. Kurzweil, however much I may
<br>
enjoy his writing.
<br>
<p>In this respect, I think the Web (and mailing lists like this one)
<br>
are far more civilized forums for exchanges between strangers.
<br>
Why would anybody want to risk a shock from a dominance-
<br>
enforcement cattleprod by facing somebody like Minsky in the
<br>
flesh, wide open to that high-bandwidth primate social signalling?
