</em><br>
<p>Why, thank you!  Not for me the self-conscious deprecation of Ed Regis;
<br>
no, I know damn well it's all real.  Not that shocking the living
<br>
daylights out of some unwary websurfer isn't fun for me as well, of
<br>
course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First it was to be 2035 (IIRC).  That would be a stretch for

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, don't rely on not having to pay off your mortgage - the range still
<br>
goes up to 2020.  (I have to say, though, that 2025, never mind 2035, now
<br>
seems so ridiculously far beyond the point of expected Singularity that
<br>
you can go ahead and rely on it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps Eliezer would like to give us a clue as to which basis he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counting on for the 2008 runaway -- (1) a software breakthrough on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat-better-than-today hardware and networking, or (2) a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradigm shift in the hardware.  Or something else?  My guess for Eliezer is (1),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of his writings on seed AIs, but my hope is (2) -- though even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if strong indications of such a shift have appeared by 2008, I wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect to have reliable and cost-effective manufacturing processes or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercial products by then.
</em><br>
<p>Why the shift?  Well, mainly:
<br>
<p>1)  Instead of visualizing the Singularity as a far-off celebration on the
<br>
day that the whole human race gets together and networks our computing
<br>
power to build the seed AI that is the final culmination of all our
<br>
accumulated programming expertise and augmented intelligence, I figured
<br>
out how to build the darn thing myself on a Beowulf network.
<br>
<p>The other reasons, in no particular order:
<br>
<p>2)  I figured out that human cognition actually uses all that parallelized
<br>
power mainly for performing operations in one neural &quot;step&quot; that are
<br>
intrinsically serial - in other words, the brain needs a massive amount of
<br>
power because the transistors run at 200hz.  You'd need a massive amount
<br>
of parallel power to run a spreadsheet if it ran on a 200hz CPU.  So my
<br>
estimate of the real computing power required to get human-equivalent
<br>
intelligence got stepped down by three or four orders of magnitude.
<br>
<p>3)  Nanotechnology moved waay faster than I expected.  So, to a lesser
<br>
extent, did cognitive science, Singularity memetics, and even non-SingInst
<br>
commercial AI.
<br>
<p>4)  I stopped thinking in terms of &quot;What is the precise degree of
<br>
ludicrousness involved in the thought of my ever getting a cent from
<br>
Social Security?&quot; and shifted to &quot;When do I need to do something if I want
<br>
to do it before the Singularity?&quot;
<br>
<p>--              --              --              --              --
