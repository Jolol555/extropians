<em>&gt; Psychic vibrations.. whoa man. Whoooaaaa!

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd bet we've got a million more stories like this, amongst us. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly is the primary enemy of extropianism; creeping credulity, amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who haven't been introduced to any way of making sound judgements

</em><br>
<p>Well, as many have pointed out, human beings are 'belief engines'.  It
<br>
is part of the wiring of our brain to look for patterns and
<br>
correspondences and to err on the side of assuming something holds
<br>
before sufficient evidence is  in.  It is only relatively recently that
<br>
we evolved monkeys have invented science to test some of our beliefs. 
<br>
Logic and reason have been around longer but they are not as deeply
<br>
wired in and take more continuous effort than most make much of the
<br>
time.  Being really bright doesn't automatically make you less
<br>
credulous.  It does make it more likely that you will get the
<br>
counter-arguments when you do hear them and perhaps come up with them
<br>
yourself.  
<br>
<p>Being introduced to the tools and actually using them are very different
<br>
things.  We also are social/cultural creatures who have quite a bit of
<br>
stake in just &quot;going with the flow&quot; even when a bit of thought will show
<br>
that the flow is being brain-dead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interestingly, I was seeing an australian clergyman of some note (???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Costello? brother of the treasurer?) interviewed recently. He was being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked about new-agey kind of stuff, and what he thought about people taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits and pieces of Asian religions, as they felt best. He replied that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought it was disastrous, because what they took was the feel good stuff,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the easy stuff. They leave out the nasty stuff, the unglamorous parts, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's a lot of that going around, in general. Critical thinking is seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite sceptically, I think, by many people. Dont worry about the head, trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your feelings. Trust your emotions. That'll be $10.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Oh yeah.  For human brains it is hard work to apply reason, logic and
<br>
critical thinking.  We have no circuits for bayseian analysis.  It is
<br>
plodding difficult inside of our heads and we don't for the most part
<br>
have handy external tools for the purpose.  And using your head that way
<br>
makes you a bit of an outsider among most people most of the time really
<br>
quickly and that isn't fun at all.  So anything that will relieve the
<br>
pressure and take that frown of concentration off your face is much
<br>
appreciated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Reducing the 'sheep-effect' by introducing extropian concepts, science,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; encouraging a more questioning attitude must come under the heading of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'good thing'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An extropian outreach program!!  Now there's an idea .... (gotta be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it doesn't become dogmatic, though).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it were to be done, it's probably better to leave most of extropianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out. Just spread the futurist ideas, the science, the information, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimism. Once people take that on board, the rest follows pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well if you have all of that in, what are you leaving out?
