At 12:34 AM 20/01/01 -0500, Michael Lowry &lt;<a href="mailto:mike@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Australia%20cf.%20USA&In-Reply-To=&lt;3.0.6.32.20010120171532.00858100@ariel.its.unimelb.edu.au&gt;">mike@datamann.com</a>&gt; :
<br>
<p>[golly, you've changed your surname, Mike?]
<br>
<p>wrote some things I'll get to eventually in response to this exchange:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Some statistics a year after Australia's gun confiscation:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;State of Victoria, homicides with firearms up 300%!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Victoria's rate *for the whole goddam year* went from 7 to 19.
</em><br>
<p>That's all I was saying there. I wasn't comparing Oz data with anyone
<br>
else's, explicitly at least. I was saying that it is either ingenuous or
<br>
disingenuous to brandish such a small noise-level movement as evidence of
<br>
*anything*, let alone any purported dire impact of `Australia's gun
<br>
confiscation'. (The immediately preceding bulge in the curve was caused by
<br>
a single atrocious massacre, incidentally.)
<br>
<p>Mike adds, amid a flurry of interesting data with no bearing whatsoever on
<br>
my post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'll bet Australias racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cross section is markedly different. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course: we are markedly heterogeneous in a rather different way
<br>
from the USA. (I'd prefer not to use the unscientific term `race', but I
<br>
see what you mean.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the Australian Bureau of Statistics [...] did admit that indigenous people
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt;about 15 times more likely to be imprisoned. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, this is rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting: it is black people in the US who [...] contribute the most to
</em><br>
crime rates.
<br>
<p>Why is that interesting? Black people in the USA are not indigenous. They
<br>
arrived as slaves, and have mostly been treated like shit by the dominant
<br>
culture and by the criminals of their own culture. Black people in Oz are
<br>
most of Aboriginal descent, so your comparison should be with American
<br>
Indians; Aborigines have mostly been treated like shit by the dominant
<br>
culture and to a lesser extent by each other, in their tragic, excluded and
<br>
deracinated circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Australia, [...] is a far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;racially monocultural nation than the US is, with its far smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indigenous population being in a very similar state of incarceration in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the justice system.
</em><br>
<p>Aboriginal people get locked up by white authorities more often than
<br>
equivalent white offenders. That's standard racism. They also commit some
<br>
crimes, of drunken trouble-making, low-level theft and violence, due to the
<br>
appalling conditions many of them live under. Again, I gather that the more
<br>
illuminating comparison is with American native peoples.
<br>
<p>It's imaginable that ready possession of hand guns among such disaffected
<br>
and desperate Aborigines in cities would swiftly escalate to terrible death
<br>
rates from firearm injuries. As it is, I get the impression that more ruin
<br>
is being self-inflicted by petrol sniffing and alcohol abuse. 
<br>
<p>The sooner we get the technologies of true abundance, the sooner these
<br>
atrocities will be a thing of the past, and the less incentive there'll be
<br>
for sticking weapons into other people's faces. Bring on the Spike!
