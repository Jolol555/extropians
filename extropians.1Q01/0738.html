<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Non-extremists have a goal.  They pull in one direction until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;goal is reached.  Then they stop.  They have logical criteria and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;stop when the objective goals have been achieved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Then by your defination my fellow NRA members and I are non-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;extremists. We have a goal, a simple one. That is to see that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;constitutional rights granted under the 2nd Amendment are restored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and that no further infringement takes place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And does &quot;SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED&quot; apply to children?  To violent criminals?  To Certified lunatics or the mentally incompetent?  I don't even see the most rabid anti-abortionists driving around with bumper stickers declaiming that &quot;you can have my fetus when you pry it from my cold dead womb&quot;!
</em><br>
<p>Because, Joe, anti-abortionists are not against them being forcibly
<br>
aborted, they are against other people aborting their own unborn
<br>
children. It is they who are seeking to restrict the legally recognised
<br>
civil rights of recognised citizens (unborn children are not citizens of
<br>
anywhere). 
<br>
If children were allowed to be taught responsible gun use as my father's
<br>
generation was, my friend John Mahoney and his parents would still be
<br>
alive today, so don't even try to pretend that you are a defender of
<br>
'the children'. Schools have become combat zones specifically because
<br>
legally carried guns are banned from their premises. Those deaths are on
<br>
YOUR head. Our workplaces have become combat zones because too many
<br>
companies prohibit employees from carrying legally permitted firearms to
<br>
work, as the Wakefield shooting demonstrates. Those deaths are on YOUR
<br>
head.
<br>
The fact is, Joe, that bad things happen. Criminals, guess what? They
<br>
don't obey laws. They don't obey laws against murder, so they certainly
<br>
are not going to obey laws against obtaining guns illegally. All we can
<br>
do is allow law abiding people to do is adequately protect themselves.
<br>
States that do this have far lower crime rates than those that don't.
<br>
Period. End of story.
<br>
BTW: Once more: are you related to Donna Dees-Thomases, founder of the
<br>
million mom march and sister-in-law of the power couple that are
<br>
Clintons biggest backers?
