Subject: Civilian Use of UltraWideband Tracking Technology
<br>
<p><p>[copy of response to private correspondence below..]
<br>
<p>The letter was to the Director for the Air Force Research Labs
<br>
localizer project.  It's an Ultra-Wideband based tracking technology
<br>
intended to allow x,y,z positional tracking within a centimeter.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.darpa.mil/ato/programs/wv/overview/99overviews/aetherwire.html">http://www.darpa.mil/ato/programs/wv/overview/99overviews/aetherwire.html</a>

<br>
<p>The technology is finally ready for market trials, but they haven't yet
<br>
selected locations.
<br>
<p>I'm interested in it for it's use as a &quot;Life Alert&quot; monitor.  Many
<br>
cryonicists have missed the opportunity to be suspended because by the time
<br>
they were discovered their brains had already gotten irrecoverably damaged.
<br>
<p>A bracelet with a pulse monitor could send a page or e-mail to a suspension
<br>
team when the person was unconscious.
<br>
<p>Of course, the positional tracker could also be useful for prisoner release
<br>
programs and perhaps electronic commerce.  In a society where citizens'
<br>
positions are known, there is less likelihood of crime.  In exchange for
<br>
volunteering coordinates, citizens may receive additional civil liberties,
<br>
such as free internet access and utilities, or perhaps even a kind of
<br>
welfare.
<br>
<p>The cost of keeping a prisoner in jail is somewhere around $60,000/year.
<br>
Many crimes are committed for the purpose of obtaining drugs.  A more
<br>
logical approach would be to simply provide the drugs for free in a
<br>
monitored fashion.  Cryonic suspension could provide a sort of mass
<br>
&quot;insurance policy&quot; to counter arguments that many addicts might overdose.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.mcwilliams.com/books/books/aint/101.htm">http://www.mcwilliams.com/books/books/aint/101.htm</a>
<br>
<p>An additional major factor in the high cost of health care is liability
<br>
insurance and the need for prescriptions.  A major risk posed by many
<br>
medications is the &quot;may cause drowsiness&quot; problem affecting the users'
<br>
ability to operate motor vehicles.  An obvious long-term solution to these
<br>
problems is the automation of the transportation system, and a transfer of
<br>
liability from health care provider to the consumer, so that prescriptions
<br>
will no longer be necessary and drugs might be taken at the individuals'
<br>
discretion.  Such technologies as the internet allow for Expert Systems to
<br>
provide counseling on recommended usage and drug interaction precautions.
<br>
<p>Besides positional tracking within a centimeter, Ultra-Wideband also
<br>
promises affordable radar for collision-avoidance systems in self-steering
<br>
lightweight electric/hybrid shuttles.  The technology has arrived, but the
<br>
current petroleum economy infrastructure doesn't allow &quot;sharing of the
<br>
roads&quot; between lightweight driverless shuttles and heavy Detroit steel
<br>
operated by human beings who are prone to error.  A possible solution is to
<br>
phase out the old systems in stages by conducting controlled tests of the
<br>
new systems in selected cities and towns.  Federal Way is &quot;ordinary&quot; and
<br>
typical of suburban America, plus it has the added advantage of high-voltage
<br>
power distribution lines cutting through the city.  The would be useful for
<br>
an electric transportation system.

<br>
<p>As far as nanotechnology goes, it may be here and in use as a surveillance
<br>
and/or social control tool before the medical applications can be fully
<br>
realized.
<br>
<p>Because of the Von Neuman self-replicating nature of assemblers and the
<br>
&quot;grey goo/blue goo&quot; problem, the technology would be too dangerous to be
<br>
made public by the military intelligence and communications agencies which
<br>
would likely be the first to use nanotechnology.
<br>
<p>Just as religions have served the function of increasing &quot;self-monitoring,&quot;
<br>
since people tend to be responsible when they feel they are being &quot;watched,&quot;
<br>
it may be useful for citizens' to adopt a philosophy of nanotechnology
<br>
already being &quot;all around us&quot; even prior to its dramatic and obvious
<br>
disclosure.  If the general public were to adjust to the feeling of being
<br>
under ubiquitous surveillance and occassional &quot;steering&quot; by machine
<br>
superintelligence, they would more likely be &quot;on their best behavior.&quot;  The
<br>
initial feelings of paranoia and powerlessness would eventually be displaced
<br>
by acceptance, since we're quite adaptable animals.
<br>
<p>Food, clothing, shelter, communications and transportation are not too
<br>
difficult to provide once we surrender the steering wheel and tolerate the
<br>
basic human need to experience pleasure.
