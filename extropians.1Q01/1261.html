hi Everyone,
<br>
<p>Yeah I saw some of that movie (Existenz), it actually brought back some 
<br>
memories of &quot;The 13th Floor&quot; for me, another pretty good movie. Speaking of 
<br>
VR technology, I was wondering if you have ever heard of Activeworlds. It is 
<br>
a standalone browser (runs on top of ISP connection) that allows you to 
<br>
interact in 3D worlds with other users' avatars and actually BUILD pretty 
<br>
much whatever you want using objects in the worlds. There are over 700 
<br>
different worlds to explore, and the largest one is 4.4% larger than the 
<br>
state of California, virtually speaking! It is the first interactve VR 
<br>
program that I have seen that allows this in such an easy to use interface. 
<br>
It is totally integrated to the web and has text chat inside it and many 
<br>
other features. Plus it is FREE to try out and only 20 bucks a year for 
<br>
&quot;citizenship&quot;. I have been trying to get as many people as I know into it 
<br>
because it is so easy to use (especially since system requirements are really 
<br>
low to run it), and because it is WAY more fun than text chat and email. 
<br>
Anyways, I thought you would all be very interested in it because it actually 
<br>
puts the &quot;space&quot; in cyberspace!
<br>
<p>Check it out here:
<br>
www.activeworlds.com
<br>
<p>and my personal Activeworlds website:

<br>
<p>Peace!  - Brian
