<p><p>I don't have a &quot;computer science background&quot; (ChemE for me), but some 
<br>
people just seem to have it and most people don't.  In fact, all the really 
<br>
good programmers I've known over the years seem to have abilities that bear 
<br>
no relation to their educational background.  I've known people with 
<br>
biology degrees, english degrees, or no degree at all that were quite a bit 
<br>
better than most of the people with CS degrees.  Which probably just 
<br>
indicates that they picked the wrong major in college. :^)
<br>
<p>Your point is taken though and it suits the market well.  People who have 
<br>
deeper abilities aren't stuck doing work they find terribly boring and the 
<br>
people who do that work are happy for the opportunity.
