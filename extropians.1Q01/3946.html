<p>
Extropes, various and sundry,
<br>
<p>Recently, in this thread,
<br>
<p>I said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Thus my suggestion that a malpractice lawsuit for failure to notify,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;inform, recommend, or apply cryonic suspension as a 'final meliorative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;clinical intervention against irreversible morbidity'.
</em><br>
<p>And Chris Russo replied:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just what Americans need - more reasons to be litigious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I sincerely hope that Extropians can approach their problems more ethically.
</em><br>
<p>I was rather surprised Chris, at the nature of your response.  Perhaps it's
<br>
the bottom feeding reputation of lawyers (despite this prejudice, few will
<br>
deny the importance of having a good one to help you when you need it), or
<br>
the overbearing, tedious, interminable, and maddeningly faulty process of
<br>
the government and the law and the courts.  Without knowing your specific
<br>
objection, I can nevertheless sympathize with that part of your response
<br>
which expresses the feeling: &quot;More bullshit litigation!!!  Puh-leeze!
<br>
Spare us!&quot;
<br>
<p>It's the 'ethical' part that puzzles me.  I don't think it's unethical to
<br>
expose folks to the 'strain' of debate and discussion--even when seen by
<br>
some as frivolous or tedious.  Nor does it seem unethical to demand--or
<br>
should I write DEMAND--a fair and thorough hearing in the highest court of
<br>
civil authority, when one believes that the issue warrants it.  It may not
<br>
be overly creative, but it certainly seems to be ethical.  In fact, it
<br>
seems somewhat compulsory, like some kind of difficult but required civic
<br>
duty, Luther tacking his complaints up on the church door. 
<br>
<p>Gene Leitl mentioned the multitude of people who had died without benefit
<br>
of suspension, and used the term medical malpractice.  Nitrogen was
<br>
liquified for the first time back in 1877, so theoretically, everyone who
<br>
has died since that time could have been suspended. Ettinger first
<br>
published his cryonics thesis in &quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot; back in
<br>
1962.  Whatever date you choose, we're talking about a lot of people who
<br>
have died since, and been condemned, perhaps unnecessarily, to dust.  As
<br>
technology progresses and the thesis gains credence--more people 'get it',
<br>
not just the forward thinking types--you reach a point where arguably,
<br>
ridicule and arbitrary dismissal become negligent in an of themselves.
<br>
Ironically this is not because the facts have changed, but rather, because
<br>
public perception has. When 'ridiculous' changes to 'perhaps'.  A medical
<br>
professional has a duty to provide the best care that he can based on
<br>
rational judgement, not on irrational prejudices or ossified beliefs.
<br>
<p>So, despite the fact that, as I said, I don't think the case would be won,
<br>
I do think there is a strong ethical foundation.  And, perhaps I failed to
<br>
emphasize it strongly enough, the main intent (as a practical matter) of
<br>
the civil action would not be to win, but rather to put the issue intthe
<br>
public spotlight under conditions where the scientific and legal theories
<br>
would be elaborated with thoroughness and seriousness.  Flip dismissiveness
<br>
and smirky ridicule might be somewhat reduced in a real court with real
<br>
power and billions of real dollars (apparently, potentially) at stake.

<p>In the same thread Adrian Tymes wrote: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Until someone is successfully revived from cryo, having been dead for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unrelated reasons before being put into cryo, cryo is not proven to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work - and thus, with no evidence of the full cycle working, doctors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are legally free to ignore it, just as they may ignore any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unproven therapy.  Sorry.
</em><br>
<p>Adrian,
<br>
<p>That little 'Sorry' at the end.  I liked it.  Made me smile.  You were
<br>
concerned about my feelings.  Didn't want me to take it too hard.  You're a
<br>
good chap.  Seriously.  I respect that.  The world could do with a few
<br>
extra million bargeloads of kindness and gentle courtesy.  I salute you.
<br>
And, not to worry, I didn't take it too hard.
<br>
<p>Of course you're right, the doctors have until now been able to ignore the
<br>
cryonics option without undue concern.  But, as I said, the object of the
<br>
civil action is not to nail them, but to get them and the public to pay
<br>
attention, see the matter in a serious light, and hopefully, embed the
<br>
meme.  In a world abundant with  technological 'miracles' cryonics becomes
<br>
less and less far-fetched.   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
