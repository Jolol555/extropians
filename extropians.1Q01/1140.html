<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay, i'm going to try my own spin on this -- feel free to slap me
<br>
out of it if i get carried away.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is kind of reminiscent of proof by induction. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* given two mental states, the more friendly state is more likely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the less friendly state to be followed by a friendly state
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- i.e. the rules of mental state generation is such that a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friendlier instantanious state is more likely to lead to a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friendlier trajectory of states
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* if at any instant, an ai is more friendly than a human being,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the ai is also more likely to be friendly in the future
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the human being -- i.e. we should trust the ai more than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the human.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so the argument would take the following route. first, show that
<br>
the rules of ai mental state generation satisfies the first point above.
<br>
then show that human mental state generation also satifies the first point
<br>
above (if not, the argument ends here). now show that the ai friendliness
<br>
function grows at least as fast as the human friendliness function.
<br>
finally, demonstrate an ai friendlier than a human. then we don't need to
<br>
wait forever to find out that the ai is really friendlier than the human;
<br>
we can just use induction to extrapolate the friendliness to infinity.
