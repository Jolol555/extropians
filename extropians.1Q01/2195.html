<p>No, they don't. There has been an instance of such an incident, called
<br>
the Battle of Athens, Tennessee, which as I recall, occured just after
<br>
WWII. Many returning veterans were fed up with the corrupt politics of
<br>
the county sherriff and put together a slate of vets to oppose him in
<br>
the election. When balloting occured, the Sherriff and his deputies took
<br>
the ballot boxes into the station to 'count' them in private, refusing
<br>
demands for observers. The vets then staged a seige of the sherriffs
<br>
station, a battle that ran for a few days until the Sherriff
<br>
surrendered, ballots were fairly counted, and the vets slate won the
<br>
election.
<br>
<p>An armed citizenry guards against any sort of abrogation of the
<br>
constitution, of the right or left. If it is only the citizens of the
<br>
right who choose to be armed, then leftist insurgencies will be more
<br>
likely to be opposed than right wing attempts, but that is a matter of
<br>
the negligence of the leftist citizens to fulfill their responsibility
<br>
as citizens. Societies get the government they deserve.
