<p>This is true, however the vast majority that are methane hydrates (and
<br>
not just clathrates in general, since its the methane molecule that
<br>
really matters, not the water structure that holds it) are in the state
<br>
they are in specifically due to pressure. Arctic clathrates come in a
<br>
range of molecular content in the tundra (which is what I assume you are
<br>
referring to in land based deposits). Methane content in land based
<br>
clathrates is released on a constant basis, there are ground formations
<br>
that are formed by this percolation process. The people promoting this
<br>
idea are the cataclysimic folks at the U of Washington that just got
<br>
their scholarly butts handed to them by my cousin's Antarctica work (for
<br>
which he was just awarded his Masters degree from the U of Maine and was
<br>
awarded the Antarctica Service Medal of the United States by the
<br>
National Science Foundation) of the last few years.
<br>
Land based methane hydrate deposits are miniscule compared to sea bed
<br>
deposits, and undergo constant cycles of storage and release with the 11
<br>
and 60 year solar cycles. Don't confuse methane hydrates specifically
<br>
with clathrates in general. This is a typical bait and switch tactic of
<br>
the leftists, trying to inflate the problem by implying that all
<br>
clathrates are methane hydrate, which they are not. Saying there are 10
<br>
million tons of clathrates that could release with warming when on 1
<br>
million tons of methane hydrate involvled (as an example), demonstrates
<br>
how they lie with statistics, and how they try to inflate the fear to
<br>
further their agenda (If residents of California have not figured out by
<br>
now that they are full of it, then there is no hope there).
