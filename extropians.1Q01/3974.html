<p>You may be right Amara.  I've only been to one Extro conference (Extro 3), some
<br>
Objectivist meetings, and the Libertarian party National Convention (twice).
<br>
Based on my conversations with some of the women I met, although many of the
<br>
women were there because they had a strong interest themselves, many seemed to
<br>
be there primarily because of their SO's interest.
<br>
<p>Perhaps it would be useful to prepare a simple (1 page) anonymous demographic
<br>
survey for participants at the next Extro conference.  Hand them the survey at
<br>
the door, with a drop box at the entrance.  Has this been done before?  If so,
<br>
anyone know the results?  What questions would you like to see asked?
<br>
