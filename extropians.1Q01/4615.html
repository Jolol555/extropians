Hi again -- back from my chill-out week!
<br>
<p>On Wed, Feb 21, 2001 at 03:30:50AM -0800, John Marlow wrote:

</em><br>
<p>But they aren't lasting. Some chunks of the Islamic world are desperately
<br>
poor, but others are wealthy. Most of the wealthy Islamic nations have
<br>
based their prosperity on the exploitation of natural resources, but a
<br>
number have built up a degree of infrastructure and ability that would
<br>
be impressive if it were not overshadowed by that of the west. Iran
<br>
is evidently building up a large higher education sector (and has an
<br>
overwhelmingly young, progress-oriented society that is causing major
<br>
headaches for the doctrinaire mullahs); Pakistan has developed the A-bomb
<br>
and is working on indiginous missile tech. Anyone want to tell me about
<br>
Malaysia or Indonesia?
<br>
<p>It's particularly important to note that the Islamic world has a
<br>
long history of respect for education, government by rule of law --
<br>
although it's not like the law *we* are familiar with -- and technological
<br>
progress; until the eighteenth century they were ahead of the west in many
<br>
respects. They took a huge kicking in the teeth when the west developed
<br>
new business methods and engaged in a massive imperial power-grab and
<br>
industrialisation during the 19th century: and the dynamics of oil-driven
<br>
economics shored up rich elites during the 20th century. But there's no 
<br>
obvious reason why they can't play catch-up faster than anyone expects,
<br>
especially once there's no oil to cushion their economies from the global
<br>
market. And in an economic system where intellectual work carries muscle,
<br>
a civilization that prides itself on scholarship and jurisprudence is well-
<br>
positioned to play catch-up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here's your basic problem: The leaders do in fact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize that technology is a threat to them. They look to the West 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they see that people who enjoy the benefits of science and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology pay little heed to religious leaders--who have actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become so completely powerless that banning a book causes the sales 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to skyrocket. Said leaders put two and two together--science and tech 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhance the powers of the individual and make religious leaders 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant--and go the other way, becoming rabid antitech nutballs. 
</em><br>
<p>This is, of course, why the Pope is denouncing heavier than air flight
<br>
(&quot;if God had meant us to fly he'd have given us wings&quot;) and microprocessors
<br>
(&quot;man needs nothing more sophisticated than the slide rule&quot;).
<br>
<p>Or to put it more clearly (and less sarcastically) I don't believe *any*
<br>
religious leaders think as reactively as that, with the possible exception
<br>
of some highly cynical televangelists. Most priests, of whatever religion,
<br>
go into it because they *believe*. Furthermore, religious leadership in
<br>
Islam seems to have a lot more to do with jurisprudence and interpretation
<br>
of the commentaries on the Koran than upon power politics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here and assuming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they possess the ability to reason (and to add two and two).
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Please refer to the rider I attached to my first posting: no flames. What
<br>
your last statement amounts to is a deep insult directed at the moral 
<br>
probity, intellectual abilities, and motivation of people who I think we
<br>
urgently need to understand. Whether understanding leads to agreement or
<br>
dissent is irrelevent at this stage: it seems to me that you're pre-judging 
<br>
the issue.
<br>
<p>This is 25% of our species we're talking about, folks. They presumably
<br>
contain the same proportion of geniuses and morons as the rest of us.
