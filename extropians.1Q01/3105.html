Update from California:
<br>
<p>The canines involved in Whipple's death are part of a fighting-dog 
<br>
ring in which dogs were bred for such jobs as protecting illicit drug 
<br>
labs. The ring was run by two white supremacist inmates at Pelican 
<br>
Bay State Prison, and in a bizarre twist, Noel and Knoller [owners of 
<br>
the dogs] have adopted one of the inmates, 38-year-old Paul John 
<br>
Schneider...
<br>
Noel told the Chronicle he has three adult children of his own who 
<br>
haven't spoken to him in years. 
<br>
The lawyer couple has represented prison guards, cops and homeless 
<br>
people; they've represented relatives in probate court and car crash 
<br>
victims in vehicular negligence cases. They also have sued their 
<br>
landlord and two San Francisco police chiefs....
<br>
Noel submitted an 18-page letter to [San Fran DA] Hallinan blaming 
<br>
Whipple for the attack. 
<br>
The dog's owner said his wife repeatedly tried to keep Whipple away 
<br>
from the dog, but Whipple continued to move toward them. He said Bane 
<br>
only lunged for her neck and throat after Whipple hit Knoller in the 
<br>
face. 
<br>
Noel went on to say the attack may have been brought on by pheromone-
<br>
based cosmetics, or that the lacrosse coach &quot;may have been a user of 
<br>
steroids&quot; that could have attracted the dogs. 
<br>
<p><p>Yah.
