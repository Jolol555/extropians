<p><p><em>&gt;I have even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had guns drawn on me once when I said that I would not consent to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;search.  Being law abiding offers no protection from the police.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Harvey Newstrom &lt;<a href="http://HarveyNewstrom.com">http://HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think there's an inescapable dilemma any society is going to face and 
<br>
always has faced regarding law enforcement officials:
<br>
Even when the laws are completely just, even when the only crimes are those 
<br>
that actually have a victim, who is going to want to be a cop? The answer 
<br>
is, with rare exception I think, that the only people who will desire police 
<br>
powers are those who are prone to abuse them. Bullies, people who want to 
<br>
have power over others, who enjoy pulling a gun on someone and seeing 
<br>
someone squirm under the gun. I can't figure out any other type of 
<br>
psychology that would make someone want to chase after and catch people, 
<br>
even people who deserve it. If someone hurt someone I loved, I'd put in a 
<br>
lot of time to see that person caught, but without that emotivator, I see 
<br>
only sadism as an explanation for putting so much of my effort into 
<br>
&quot;catching&quot; people. I think speed limits are good laws, but I can't imagine 
<br>
getting pleasure out of waiting in speed trap to ruin people's days, unless 
<br>
I had a predatory type of personality.
<br>
The only exceptions to this I can think of are tradition (&quot;my father was a 
<br>
cop&quot;), which probably makes up a sizable minority of motivations for people 
<br>
going into law enforcement.
<br>
Another possibility is as a desire to right a wrong done to them earlier in 
<br>
life (like Batman - who isn't technically a cop I guess). I suspect this 
<br>
doesn't make up a strong portion of motivations.
<br>
This doesn't exist in our society I think, but people may also want to 
<br>
become cops as a last resort when they can't find a job. I think a lot of 
<br>
people who join the Army do so because of this.
<br>
<p>A possible solution to this dilemma is to shift police responsibilities into 
<br>
other occupations. For example, have speed limit enforcement be moved to the 
<br>
area of road consturction/maintenance (this may be a bad example but I can't 
<br>
think of a better one at the moment). The people drawn to do it, then, will 
<br>
be drawn for other aspects of the occupation, and not the domination aspect.
