<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                    January 31, 2001
<br>
<p>NEW ERA BEGINS AS MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR COMPLETES PRIME MISSION
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which has 
<br>
collected more information about the red planet than all 
<br>
previous missions combined, completes its primary science 
<br>
mission today and begins a new era of continued exploration.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;By any conceivable measure the scientific impact of Mars 
<br>
Global Surveyor has been extraordinary.  In many ways we now 
<br>
know Mars to be a different planet than when the spacecraft 
<br>
arrived in 1997, and our perspective continues to evolve as 
<br>
the data keep flowing,&quot; said Dr. Arden Albee, Global Surveyor 
<br>
project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in 
<br>
Pasadena.  &quot;In some aspects, we now have better maps of Mars 
<br>
than we do of Earth.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the primary science mission, the spacecraft 
<br>
studied the climate, surface topography and subsurface 
<br>
resources and mapped the entire planet,&quot; said Tom Thorpe, 
<br>
Global Surveyor project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
<br>
Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  &quot;The extended mission will 
<br>
continue to take advantage of these extraordinary mapping 
<br>
capabilities and the data will be used to select future 
<br>
landing sites for several upcoming missions.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars Global Surveyor's extended mission has been approved 
<br>
through April 2002.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robotic orbiter was launched on Nov. 7, 1996, and 
<br>
arrived at Mars on Sept. 12, 1997. The spacecraft began its 
<br>
primary mapping mission in March 1999 and has collected data 
<br>
for a full Martian year, equivalent to about two Earth years. 
<br>
Those comprehensive observations are proving invaluable to 
<br>
understanding the seasonal changes on Mars.
<br>
<p>Some of the most significant findings of the mission include:
<br>
<p>-- Enticing evidence for recent liquid water at the Martian 
<br>
surface.
<br>
<p>-- Dramatic evidence for layering of rocks that points to 
<br>
widespread ponding of water or lakes on Mars in its early 
<br>
history.
<br>
<p>-- The first good estimate of the amount of water currently 
<br>
trapped in both Martian polar caps combined -- about one and a 
<br>
half times the amount of ice in Greenland.
<br>
<p>-- Topographic evidence for a South Pole-to-North Pole slope 
<br>
that controlled the transport of water and sediments, and 
<br>
recognition of the flat Northern Hemisphere that has been 
<br>
proposed as the possible site of an ancient ocean.
<br>
<p>-- The surprising detection of highly magnetized crust in the 
<br>
Southern Hemisphere, which indicates rapid cooling of Mars in 
<br>
the beginning of its history that may have contributed to its 
<br>
earlier, warmer climate.
<br>
<p>-- The first reliable models of the crustal structure of Mars, 
<br>
including the detection of ancient impact basins and possible 
<br>
channels buried beneath the northern plains.
<br>
<p>-- Identification of the mineral hematite, indicating a past 
<br>
surface-hydrothermal environment that may be an analog for the 
<br>
kinds of areas in which early life developed on Earth.
<br>
<p>-- Significantly improved understanding of the dynamics of the 
<br>
atmosphere, including the monitoring of cyclonic storms, and 
<br>
the daily and seasonal behavior of carbon dioxide and water 
<br>
ice clouds. 
<br>
<p>-- Extensive evidence for the role of dust in re-shaping the 
<br>
recent Martian environment in the form of dust devils, dust 
<br>
storms, dunes and sand sheets.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 4:33 p.m. PST (7:33 p.m. EST) January 31, 2001, the 
<br>
spacecraft will have made 8,505 orbits of the planet and taken 
<br>
more than 58,000 images, 490 million laser-altimeter shots to 
<br>
measure topography and 97 million spectral measurements.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Global Surveyor mission is managed by JPL for NASA's 
<br>
Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. Lockheed Martin 
<br>
Astronautics, Denver, Colo., developed and operates the 
<br>
spacecraft. JPL is a division of the California Institute of 
<br>
Technology.
