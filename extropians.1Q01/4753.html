<em>&gt;You have to read these recount reports carefully.  This is not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Miami-Dade county recount results.  This particular article only 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;an effect on the election.
</em><br>
<p>C'mon, Harvey, is that a fair characterization?  Jesse Jackson and 
<br>
Rep Wexler(D) were the first ones in the news down there that I saw. 
<br>
It seemed that Jesse Jackson was with protesters on the street of 
<br>
Palm Beach County before James Baker even arrived in Florida.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, even the Democrats on the Miami-Dade canvassing board 
<br>
are on the record as saying that there was no &quot;riot&quot;.  There were no 
<br>
arrests.  They made no decisions out of fear of GOP protester 
<br>
reprisals.
<br>
<p>The Democrats were looking at a loss, so they sent in their team of 
<br>
lawyers to put all the pressure they could on the courts and 
<br>
canvassing boards to try to obtain a win.
<br>
<p>The Republicans were pushing in the opposite direction with their 
<br>
lawyers, working for decisions that would preserve the Bush lead. 
<br>
What were the Republicans supposed to do, sit on their hands while 
<br>
the Democrats were busting their humps to pull out a win?
<br>
<p>It was a power struggle - initiated by the Democrats and finished by 
<br>
the Republicans.
<br>
<p>I could be equally one-sided and say, &quot;They wanted to find out if the 
<br>
specific disruption caused by Democrat staff members flying to Miami 
<br>
to convince their operatives to change the rules - after the vote 
<br>
took place - had an effect on the election.&quot;
<br>
<p>The article noted that they even counted the votes according to the 
<br>
most liberal rules of &quot;what is a vote&quot;.  Rules that the canvassing 
<br>
board members were publicly on the record as being *opposed* to 
<br>
before this presidential election.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   They determined that this particular subset of the recount would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not have disrupted the entire election.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the article also factored in the results of the recounts in 
<br>
other counties that Gore's team had requested.  This particular 
<br>
&quot;subset&quot; is the subset of what would have happened if Gore had gotten 
<br>
everything he asked for.  Following the rules of the election plus 
<br>
some rule bending just for Gore, Bush still won.  It's a rather 
<br>
significant view of the data to be rhetorically denigrated as just a 
<br>
&quot;subset&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This sample is too small, too localized, and too specific to one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;type of ballot to predict the results of a county-wide recount or a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state-wide recount.  I think such predictions are merely guesses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until we actually count all six million Florida votes.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, we'll never know a precise count.  Even if we count all the votes 
<br>
in all the counties, what do we do about the 1,200 felony votes that 
<br>
are in there?  What do we do about all of the multiple votes?
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.miami.com/herald/special/news/elect2000/decision/102736.htm">http://www.miami.com/herald/special/news/elect2000/decision/102736.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ninety-year-old Cora Thigpen voted twice in the presidential
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;election -- and would have liked to have voted more.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``If I had voted a half dozen times, I would have voted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every time for Al Gore,'' the North Florida resident said.&quot;
<br>
<p>The whole thing was a big nasty mess, and the actual count has been 
<br>
one-way hashed.  We'll never find out what would have happened if the 
<br>
voting system had been perfectly fair.
<br>
<p>Arguing that we'll ever have anything *but* &quot;guesses&quot; is nothing but 
<br>
an exercise in baseless speculation where everyone will see what they 
<br>
want to see.  As usual, history will depend upon who writes the 
<br>
history books.  The facts are gone forever.
