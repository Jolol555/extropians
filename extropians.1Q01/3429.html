In the Niven stories about low and zero-g human life, the people evolved
<br>
slightly longer limbs.  That was an environement where they were free falling in
<br>
atmosphere.  So, it is completely different than how today we build a space
<br>
station very conservatively with regards to human requirements.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Things you're not considering: Whoever goes, if it's a one-way trip

</em><br>
<em>&gt; good thing for those in charge of beginning a second civilization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also--you have to feed and air-supply the full-sizers once you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grown them. If you didn't bring the food with you--where's it coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You mentioned the speed with which civilizations can arise. Sure--but

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My point?... It's expensive. Deal with it. (And not by launching

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;How about humans genetically modified to 10 kg?  Humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;have genetically modified poodles and chihuahuas (~4kg) from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;wolves (~50 kg).  Similarly domestic cats from the wild variety.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;No, forget it, unethical.  Damn.  Those born tiny would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;volunteers.  We can use only volunteers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ever compare the intelligence of a house cat to a lion? Or a chihuahua to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Great Dane?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The resulting creature would be mostly brain, not much use for colonization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or exploration unless backed by mucho hardware, which I believe would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outweigh the traveler by quite a bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unless you are going back to the idea of sending a modified (or crippled)

<p>When we talked about this before, it came up that women were more suited
<br>
physiologically in some ways for living in space.
<br>
<p>Chuck mentions some pretty sick ideas.
<br>
<p>Any humans expected to reproduce, there must at least be a healthy couple.
