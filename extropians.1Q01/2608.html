<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Multiple sclerosis halted in primate model
<br>
<p>Multiple sclerosis occurs when a person's immune system becomes sensitized
<br>
to a protein on the surface of the myelin cells which form the sheath
<br>
covering the nerves. This sensitization causes the class of immune cells
<br>
known as killer T cells to attack myelin, disabling nerve conduction,
<br>
which creates the symptoms of the disease. With each instance of immune
<br>
attack, multiple sclerosis patients experience a relapse, which consists
<br>
of an exacerbation of symptoms that often results in further disability.
<br>
<p>In research published in the February 2000 Journal of Immunology, a
<br>
disease resembling human MS was experimentally induced in marmosets by the
<br>
administration of small amounts of myelin basic protein, the antigen that
<br>
triggers immune attack in MS. The monkeys were then treated with moderate
<br>
or very high doses of the antigen, while a control group received no
<br>
treatment. The monkeys who received the highest dose experienced a
<br>
shutdown of their immune response to the antigen and a reduction in
<br>
central nervous system lesions characteristic of the disease. Those who
<br>
received moderate doses took longer to develop the disease. The control
<br>
monkeys exhibited human multiple sclerosis symptoms caused by significant
<br>
myelin damage as shown by brain scans.
<br>
<p>The researchers, led by Michael Lenardo MD, of the National Institute of
<br>
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acted on the knowledge that high and
<br>
repeated doses of antigen can supress T cell mediated diseases in rodents.
<br>
The mechanism is a safeguard to prevent too many T cells from being
<br>
activated. Dr Lenardo stated, &quot;Current treatments for MS broadly suppress
<br>
the immune system and can cause toxic side effects. This treatment, called
<br>
antigen-specific immunotherapy, specifically targets the immune system's T
<br>
cells that cause the disease. Presumably, it would not lead to such side
<br>
effects. The therapy is counter-intuitive; one might think it would be
<br>
like pouring gasoline on a fire. But the self-destruct sequence actually
<br>
protects the body from having too many active T cells, which can
<br>
themselves be toxic. Like any potent weapon, you want to control how much
<br>
is deployed. The immune system doesn't let your T cells grow uncontrolled
<br>
and kill you. In this case, adding more antigen smothers the fire.&quot;
<br>
<p>The authors concluded that specific antigen-directed therapy can be
<br>
effective in primates without toxicity. This research has important
<br>
implications for the development of treatments for all autoimmune diseases.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Multiple sclerosis
<br>
<p>The many various symptoms of multiple sclerosis include difficulty in
<br>
walking, numbness, paralysis, vision loss, pain, headache. Less common
<br>
symptoms are coordination problems, slurred speech, tremors, a decline in
<br>
cognitive function, and a sudden onset of paralysis (a symptom similar to
<br>
stroke but without a cardiovascular connection).
<br>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction occurs in about half (50%) of patients with MS.
<br>
Fortunately only about 10% of MS patients develop cognitive dysfunction
<br>
severe enough to significantly impact daily life. Family members of MS
<br>
patients are usually the first to notice changes in personality or changes
<br>
in their daily routine. Cognitive dysfunction can range from not being
<br>
able to find the right word in conversation, to impaired reasoning
<br>
ability. Measuring cognitive dysfunction requires specially trained
<br>
medical professionals known as neuropsychologists. Neuropsychologists
<br>
conduct a series of tests used to determine the level of cognitive
<br>
dysfunction present and the strengths still retained by the MS patient.
<br>
<p>Research into the use of vitamin B12 has been conducted in Japan and
<br>
England. In Japan, researchers found that massive doses of vitamin B12 (60
<br>
mg a day for 6 months) improved visual and auditory potentials over the
<br>
pretreatment period. The study in England arrived at the conclusion that
<br>
for those patients below the age of 18, early symptoms were associated
<br>
with lower vitamin B12 levels, compared to those patients who were older
<br>
than 18 when MS was first detected.
<br>
<p>Several other studies present similar data concerning the presence of
<br>
serum vitamin B12 and MS onset. Some studies were concerned with a causal
<br>
relationship concerning the use of steroids, low folate count, poor
<br>
vitamin B12 metabolism, and low serum vitamin B12. A study published in
<br>
the journal Internal Medicine (1994 Feb.; 33(2):82-86) investigated the
<br>
daily administration of 60 mg of methylcobalamin to patients with chronic
<br>
progressive MS. Although motor disability did not improve, there were
<br>
clinical improvements in visual and auditory MS-related disabilities. The
<br>
scientists stated that methylcobalamin might be an effective adjunct to
<br>
immunosuppressive treatment for chronic progressive MS. Those with less
<br>
serious forms of MS may consider adding methylcobalamin to their daily
<br>
treatment regimen.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Methylcobalamin 5 mg tablets
<br>
<p>Methylcobalamin is the neurologically active form of vitamin B12. The
<br>
liver does not convert cyanocobalamin, the commonly available form of
<br>
vitamin B12, into adequate amounts of methylcobalamin, which the body uses
<br>
to treat or correct neurological defects. Animal studies have shown that
<br>
high doses of methylcobalalmin are effective in neuron regeneration and
<br>
that there is no known toxicity at these doses.

<br>
<p>Mega-GLA softgel capsules
<br>
<p>Benefits of GLA include:
<br>
1. Vasodilation of blood vessels which can reduce high blood pressure.
<br>
2. Reduction of abnormal blood clotting which can reduce the risk of heart
<br>
attack and stroke.
<br>
3. Enhanced regulation of immune response, specifically a reduction in
<br>
autoimmune dysfunction, the underlying cause of rheumatoid arthritis.
<br>
4. Enhanced defense against abnormal cell proliferation which may prevent
<br>
and even reverse some cancers.
<br>
5. Elimination of common skin disorder such as eczema.
<br>
6. Slowing of some aspects of normal aging through a mechanism similar to
<br>
that of calorie restriction.

<p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE, January 2001
<br>
Life Extension Q and A
<br>
<p>Q: I'd really appreciate any information you can provide about the use of
<br>
methylcobalamin for nerve damage and healing. Methylcobalamin was
<br>
recommended to me due to the problem I have with my ulnar nerve. Can you
<br>
shed some light?
<br>
<p>A:  Methylcobalamin is the neurological active form of vitamin B12. The
<br>
liver does not convert cyanocobalamin, the commonly available form of
<br>
vitamin B12, into adequate amounts of methylcobalamin, which the body uses
<br>
to treat or correct neurological defects. Animal studies have shown that
<br>
high doses of methylcobalamin are effective in neuron regeneration and
<br>
that there is no known toxicity at these doses. Research shows that this
<br>
active form of B12 has the unique ability to provoke the regeneration of
<br>
nerves without adverse side effects. This is because B12 facilitates
<br>
methylation, the process that creates and maintains nerves and brain
<br>
chemicals. Research shows that a lack of methylcobalamin causes
<br>
degeneration of the brain and spinal cord-a condition known as subacute
<br>
combined degeneration. In this disease, nerves lose their insulation and
<br>
begin to deteriorate. This process, known as demyelination, occurs in
<br>
other neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic
<br>
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
