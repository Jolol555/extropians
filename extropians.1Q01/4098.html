<br>
<em>&gt; But for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some reason, consumers of regular chips don't seem to report this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon while consumers of Olestra do.
</em><br>
<p>This is because Olestra is a new product.  The media, or the attention of
<br>
the world, is focused on it.  They don't care about the old chips - that's
<br>
old news.  What is news is that their might be a dangerous side effect thus
<br>
each case is news - is doesn't mean that it is significant.
<br>
<p>It is sort of like when there was an epidemic of &quot;flesh eating disease&quot; here
<br>
in Canada.  Basically there was an outbreak in a city and a few got it.
<br>
Then for the next six months or so every new case made headlines.  In fact
<br>
there is a low rate of this disease happening all the time but it was
<br>
usually not reported - or after the epidemic did each new isolated indecent
<br>
become newsworthy.

<em>&gt; We cannot just ignore a high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of consumer complaints just because laboratory testing cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce the problem.  All recalled products, such as Thalidomide,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were first proven safe in the laboratory.  Some of their effects were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not detected until a high number of problem reports started coming in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the field.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't to say that there might be something, but trying to infer the
<br>
truth though self selected sampling (reported illnesses to FDA) is extremely
<br>
error prone.  More studies are probably the way to a solution if the
<br>
self-selected sample is figured to be near significant.
<br>
<p>All the best,
