A post on another list that I cite and then respond to:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Hayflick said that even if the most common causes of death - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancer, heart disease and stroke - were eliminated, &quot;the increase 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in life expectancy would be no more than 15 years.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With those death causes gone, he said, the true cause of death 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be revealed: the aging process. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Aging, he said, is a decline on a molecular level that makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people &quot;increasingly vulnerable to disease&quot; and that this process 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not receiving much research attention. 
</em><br>
<p>True in a way. But this entire argument is wrong-headed. It's like the case
<br>
that could have been made during most of human history against the
<br>
possibility of skyscrapers. You just can't build that tall - the mud will
<br>
crumble under compressive forces, no matter how much straw you mix with it.
<br>
And even if you could find a miracle building material, all the upper
<br>
floors would be taken up by staircases, and anyway nobody is fit enough to
<br>
climb to the 80th floor and down again every day. Then along comes steel
<br>
and electricity and the elevator. 
<br>
<p>So obviously superlongevity will not emerge from brushing your teeth and
<br>
eating right. It will come from a blend of the genome program data, fast
<br>
computational protein folding, and nanotechnology. Neither of the latter
<br>
are receiving as much funding right now as routine cardiac surgery, say,
<br>
but once they get past the bootstrap stage they'll be soaring up Moore's
<br>
Law's exponential curve and rebuilding human expectations. I just hope it
<br>
comes together before I fall apart. 
<br>
<p>As for the social problems of indefinite longevity in a closed (but
<br>
efficiently nano-recycling) world: that's an issue I'll be glad to devote a
<br>
couple of centuries to help sort out.
