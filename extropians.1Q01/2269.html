<p>As a fly, you're more likely to find food, at least more likely than a

Mmmmh, yummy. Here, have another turd.

<p>How does Java fit into *nix? Inasmuch is Java good stuff, because it pays

a lot if you can code it? Strange metric.

<br>
wrong with computers.
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey, I'm a nuclear scientist. I have no clue about the physics nor engineering
<br>
of the problem domain, but I don't have to. It gets the job done, most of the 
<br>
time, today.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; specific problems for businesses.  They may not get paid as much as a senior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java developer, but $45K - $65K is not unheard of.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; 4.  With #3 in mind, it is safe to say that 70-80% of these people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a difficult time getting a &quot;real&quot; programming job and thus might be

</em><br>
<p>Which would probably be only for all our best in the aftermath. Ha-ha,

only serious.

<em>&gt; 5.  I know this can't be a forgone conclusion, but it seems to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft has created a fantastic opportunity for millions of intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet non-computer science trained people to make much more money than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could if Microsoft didn't exist.  These people contribute greatly to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy, and I think the world is better off with them.
</em><br>
<p>Microsoft has invented the mouse, the windows-based GUI, multitasking, multiuser,
<br>
hard realtime, Ethernet networking, the hyperlink, the gopher/ftp/http/usenet, 
<br>
the file system, checkpoints, clusters, OOP and persistant objects, the hard 
<br>
drive, the microprocessor and DRAM as well as the personal computer? Plus Everything Else?
<br>
<p>I recommend going to a *good* library, and skimming every computer magazine 
<br>
since 1980, or before, if you can manage it. It shouldn't take much more than
<br>
a week, maybe two. I recommend taking some heavy antidepressiva as a precaution, 
<br>
'cause it won't be pretty.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Most of the Visual Basic developers that I know are not computer science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained.  Most easily found a job after doing a bit of work at home and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free for others.  Many have no college degrees.  I am aware, though, of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful business projects that are implemented solely with Visual Basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other Microsoft products.
</em><br>
<p>What only would have happened if there was no Microsoft, and no Visual Basic?
<br>
Why, these poor people would be forced to build their own computers from bits 
<br>
of rocks and shoestring, and write their software in Aramaic. Puh-leeze.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps I'm an idiot, or a blind sheep following an EVIL company, but by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working for companies which use Microsoft software I am now earning more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than SEVEN times as much money this year than I did in 1995.  My wife, who
</em><br>
<p>Good for you. Bad for us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; has no college degree, is making more than $50 an hour doing contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming with Microsoft technologies.  That's money that we're using to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy a new house, have lots of cool toys, and ensure that our son gets the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best private education available in Phoenix, AZ.
</em><br>
<p>Very good for your son. I hope he'll make good use of that education.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I know of a LOT of more people with similar stories.  Scott McNealy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Larry Ellison have created no where NEAR the opportunity to achieve this
</em><br>
<p>What is this people and focus on single source thing? Do you think Oracle
<br>
makes much better software than Microsoft? Why need I be for Sun, or Oracle
<br>
or XY if I'm against Microsoft?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; level of success as Bill Gates has - directly or indirectly.  I don't love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft or Bill Gates, but I do respect them for the opportunities they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have given me.
</em><br>
<p>I would respect your decision if you had sampled all the alternative
<br>
realities, and found them wanting. There *are* way worse alternative realities,
<br>
but then, there are a lot better ones. Blame IBM/Intel/Microsoft from smothering
<br>
them in their cradles.
<br>
<p>If customers didn't have the temporal depth of a parking lot puddle, IT world
<br>
wouldn't be such a sorry mess as it is now.
