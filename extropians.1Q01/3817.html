Thought this might be of interest.  I finished reading _Total Freedom_ weeks
<br>
ago and hope to participate in the seminar.  I'm also working on a review
<br>
hopefully to be completed and published later this year.:/
<br>
<p>Cheers!

<br>
<p>Chris Sciabarra's Hayek-L seminar on his recent book _Total Freedom: Toward

a Dialectical Libertarianism_ begins Feb. 26.  Sciabarra's book is available

<br>
<p>Book Description:
<br>
An effort to reclaim dialectics as a viable methodology for libertarian
<br>
social theory. Building upon his previous books about Marx, Hayek, and Rand,
<br>
Total Freedom completes what Lingua Franca has called Sciabarra’s &quot;epic
<br>
scholarly quest&quot; to reclaim dialectics, usually associated with the Marxian
<br>
left, as a methodology that can revivify libertarian thought. Part One
<br>
surveys the history of dialectics from the ancient Greeks through the
<br>
Austrian school of economics. Part Two investigates in detail the work of
<br>
Murray Rothbard as a leading modern libertarian, in whose thought Sciabarra
<br>
finds both dialectical and nondialectical elements. Ultimately, Sciabarra
<br>
aims for a dialectical-libertarian synthesis, highlighting the need (not
<br>
sufficiently recognized in liberalism) to think of the &quot;totality&quot; of
<br>
interconnections in a dynamic system as the way to ensure human freedom
<br>
while avoiding &quot;totalitarianism&quot; (such as resulted from Marxism).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the Author:
</em><br>
&quot;TOTAL FREEDOM completes the &quot;Dialectics and Liberty&quot; trilogy that began
<br>
with MARX, HAYEK, AND UTOPIA (SUNY, 1995), and AYN RAND: THE RUSSIAN RADICAL
<br>
(Penn State Press, 1995). The trilogy entails a re-reading of intellectual
<br>
history; it focuses on the Aristotelian roots and nature of dialectics and
<br>
its relationship to radical theory. More importantly, it highlights the use
<br>
of dialectical method by classical liberals and libertarians who have been
<br>
constructing a non-Marxist radicalism, one that recognizes the dynamic
<br>
interrelationships between the personal and the political, the
<br>
psychological, ethical, cultural, and economic. Ultimately, it provides a
<br>
foundation for libertarian social theory, one that stresses the necessity of
<br>
context -- the &quot;totality&quot; of systemic and dynamic connections among social
<br>
problems (hence, &quot;total&quot;) that beckon toward fundamentally libertarian
<br>
solutions (hence, &quot;freedom&quot;).&quot;
<br>
<p>Peter Boettke:
<br>
&quot;TOTAL FREEDOM is a first-rate contribution to social theory and the
<br>
enduring political project of a free and humane society.&quot;
<br>
<p>Don Lavoi:
<br>
&quot;TOTAL FREEDOM offers . . . a profoundly radical social perspective . . . a
<br>
bold successor to Marxian radicalism . . . Its scholarship is
<br>
extraordinary.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bertell Ollman:
<br>
&quot;Total Freedom offers a convincing demonstation of how crucial a role
<br>
dialectics has played in the work of many of our greatest philosophers. No
<br>
one interested in dialectics — or in the problems of change and interaction
<br>
on which it centers—can afford to miss Sciabarra’s scholarly and
<br>
surprisingly lucid history of dialectical thinking.&quot;
<br>
<p>Barbara Branden:
<br>
&quot;Chris Sciabarra’s Total Freedom is an astonishing work, astonishing in the
<br>
depth and breadth of its scholarship, in its evidence of the use of the
<br>
dialectic process by philosophers such as Aristotle, in its discovery of
<br>
dialectics in the work of economists such as Murray Rothbard, and—most of
<br>
all—in the first-handedness of its author. Unlike so many other scholars and
<br>
historians, Sciabarra looks at the history of philosophy through his own
<br>
eyes and his own understanding. As a result, this beautifully and clearly
<br>
written book will make the reader reexamine the history of philosophy and
<br>
the history of dialectics by means of a new epistemological perspective: the
<br>
perspective of dialectics. Total Freedom is a landmark in philosophical
<br>
studies and interpretation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nathaniel Branden:
<br>
&quot;In a lucid, scholarily, and daringly original exercise in truly independent
<br>
thinking, Chris Sciabarra reclaims the concept of dialectics and makes its
<br>
methodology the foundation for a radical defense of 'the libertarian
<br>
vision.' In his originality, Sciabarra is a man ahead of his time. He
<br>
stimulates us with fresh and provocative perspectives, and challenges us to
<br>
join him at the intellectual heights he so persuasively traverses. Must
<br>
reading for all those committed to the ideal of a truly free society.&quot;
<br>
