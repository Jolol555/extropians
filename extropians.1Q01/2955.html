<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Only if you get one first, and not then.

<em>&gt; &gt; Fortunately, I'm not a felon or violent felon, which were the types I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was directing my comments toward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think felons, when they've paid their debt to society, and are back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying taxes to society, they should get their vote back.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have a problem, assuming they pass a citizenship test. I never
<br>
said they would have to have this permanently. This was a concept for an
<br>
alternative to prison, a sort of mobile house arrest idea, where only
<br>
those who prove their unfitness to live in a trust society must live
<br>
under the rules of a 'transparent society'.
<br>
<p>My opposition to a transparent society is it automatically treats
<br>
everyone like felons. The technologies needed for a transparent society
<br>
can be applied far easier to treating felons like felons and free people
<br>
like free people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many people here have children in various forms.  Some of them might get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caught up in something when they turn 18 and be found guilty of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime.  Noone here would ever accept your device being put on anyone they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love.  What you have suggested is cruel and unusual punishment.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. Nobody would be in pain, while the stunner would be used
<br>
either for instances where the wearer doesn't care about being observed
<br>
(i.e. in a rage, etc) or at a low level to 'train' the felon into having
<br>
a concience via negative feedback. Far more humane than prison,
<br>
especially for non-violent offenders, they wouldn't be exposed to
<br>
incorrigibles so much and would not be at risk of prison rape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not being a felon nor draconian, you can call me &quot;Dragon.&quot;  If there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a live-or-die self-defense situation, I would kill my assailant.
</em><br>
<p>Me too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somewhere, on the books, there is a law that you have broken.  Many laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be changed.
</em><br>
<p>No doubt on both counts. I have not, however, committed any felonies.
