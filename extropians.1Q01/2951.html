</em><br>
<p>Yes, Michael. And, FWIW, let the record show once more that while John
<br>
Marlow later wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; Ah, well. No, actually I meant for the reasonably forseeable future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And on the contrary, assuming ANYone's EVER going to fund it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches absurdity.
</em><br>
<p>...what he posted at the start of this thread was:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The chances that we're ever gonna make it off this rock in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaningful way are a billion to one, to be kind.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;We&quot;, &quot;ever&quot;, &quot;meaningful&quot;... these words slip and slide as the
<br>
conversation continues. 
<br>
<p>Also, Mr. Marlow persists in speaking of &quot;funding&quot; &quot;it&quot; as some
<br>
megaproject, like getting to the Moon in 1969. Yup, can't drive a city's
<br>
worth of inhabitants to Mars (or wherever) in one big tin can which
<br>
disintegrates enroute, so no one can ever live there, yup yup. Absurd to
<br>
think so, yup yup. We are in agreement. Comes time to try flying, you
<br>
can't build much more that actually works than da Vinci's parachute with
<br>
his technology base, either.
<br>
<p>There is very little foreseeable future, and that timeline does not
<br>
intersect well with &quot;ever&quot;. &quot;Billion to one&quot; was, as expected, mere
<br>
florid posturing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Odd that you equate science fiction with stupdity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As the man said, Imagination is more important than knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Jeee. Zisss.
<br>
<p>&quot;Fell off the turnip truck...first [sf] convention&quot; is, you know, like,
<br>
what they call an image, and all. You know, like, umm, a metaphor or
<br>
something, like, for someone who is naive, like, you know? Hmm?
<br>
<p>For a professional communicator, this fellow strikes me as frequently
<br>
supercilious, sloppy, hyperbolic, and rather lazy. I've been all these
<br>
things in my time, but I hope I'm getting better. I extend the same hope
<br>
to him. But I'm tired, I've done my part. Somebody tell me if he writes
<br>
something interesting, please. *PLONK*
