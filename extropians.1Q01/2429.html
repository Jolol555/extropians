<em>&gt; human nature, then you are ill-equipped to do business with sapients that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-human -- unless you can coerce them into pretending to be human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, the natural rights theory of the 18th century is infused with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiosity: the US constitution reeks of deism, and the country that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belongs to has a higher per-capita proportion of fundamentalists than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about anywhere on the planet except Afghanistan and Iran. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Charlie,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     You might like to look at Robert L. Humphrey's VALUES FOR A NEW MILLENIUM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where in he claims to have found a couple of basic natural rights that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shared by all human societies and seem to be shared by some of our animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends.  He also asserts that Thomas Jefferson's philosophy as having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derived from a member of the Scotish enlightenment instead the normal sources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the other founding fathers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Further Mihal Csikszentmihalye in FLOW and THE EVOLVING SELF asserts a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure of happiness that can gauge all societies.  He shares some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurements from a number of different societies and they were at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising and worth pondering.
</em><br>
<p>These are very good sources. Look, its rather simple, there are things
<br>
that if you ask people they want to be able to do in their lives, they
<br>
will generally agree on if not put in political terms. They generally
<br>
involve being left alone to run their lives as they wish. There are also
<br>
taboos, like incest, murder, rape, theft, etc that are universal to all
<br>
cultures. These taboos wouldn't be universal if there were not some
<br>
objective basis for them.
