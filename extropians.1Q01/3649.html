Harvey writes, regarding the ABC news segment on cryonics,
<br>
<em>&gt; Peter Jennings had more than just a chuckle.  I distinctly heard him 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say, &quot;I know it's serious.&quot; and then &quot;My producer was saying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something in my ear.&quot;  My guess is that he was laughing and was going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make a sarcastic comment when his producer specifically instructed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him through his earphone not to say what he was about to say and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this segment was serious.
</em><br>
<p>I think he said, &quot;I know it's serious; I was going to, but my producer
<br>
is telling me in my ear that I should not.&quot;  Then he went on to say that
<br>
it would be possible to chat with Robert Ettinger on-line when the show
<br>
was over.  It was confusing, but I think he had been going to make a
<br>
joke about cryonics and was being advised not to by the producer.
<br>
<p>I felt his reaction undercut what had been a very optimistic story
<br>
about the prospects of cryonics working, emphasizing the future role
<br>
of nanotech and concluding with the suggestion that the patients might
<br>
have a new life to return to after all.  It was apparently part of a
<br>
week-long series of reports on &quot;future medicine&quot;.
<br>
<p>IMO it just goes to show how disreputable cryonics is, that after
<br>
following his script and dutifully giving the segment a respectful
<br>
lead-in, Jennings felt compelled to distance himself from the story by
<br>
his chuckle and almost-joke.  Imagine if Jennings had reacted similarly
<br>
to a story on possible cures for cystic fibrosis or ALS.  It's impossible.
<br>
We see from this how far cryonics remains from the mainstream.
