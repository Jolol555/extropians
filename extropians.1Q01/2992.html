<em>&gt;Makes you afraid to show your face in public--criminal or no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Next the thing will trap suspected criminals as they pass through a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gateway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Welcome to the future.
</em><br>
<p>What's the difference between this system and being in a small town, 
<br>
where the local police officers know who the typical &quot;trouble makers&quot; 
<br>
are?
<br>
<p>What's the difference between this system and having a large team of 
<br>
police officers, who have thoroughly studied hundreds of photos of 
<br>
felons and wanted criminals, watching near the gate?
<br>
<p>No matter how you slice it, law enforcement is intrusive.  It's hard 
<br>
to make a case against the use of technology in law enforcement just 
<br>
because it's more thorough at its job.  They're not breaking into 
<br>
anyones' houses.  They're not tapping anyones' phone conversations. 
<br>
They're not racially profiling and detaining people.  So what's the 
<br>
problem besides the fact that they're now better at their jobs?
<br>
<p>Personally, I think that there's too much real crime in our society, 
<br>
so solutions like this that don't violate anyones' rights don't 
<br>
bother me.
