<p>Yes it has. One problem is that most childbearing occurs below the
<br>
poverty line and to people with high school educations or less. Its the
<br>
stupid people that are breeding.

</em><br>
<p>Good point. Population growth in most countries that has has dropped to
<br>
zero or near zero have done so because of education, specifically
<br>
education of women. You educate women, and they are less inclined, I
<br>
think, to seek fulfillment in raising children and more inclined to seek
<br>
fulfillment in careers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; grant welfare to individuals and families where the parent, or parents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are in school, either vocational or college, and unemployment coverage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that goes beyond 6 months would mandate that the worker engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; retraining classes and agree to move to a region of lower unemployment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh huh.  This assumes a &quot;normal world&quot; of job opportunity distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across most intelligence levels of the population.  What about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, by local beliefs coming rapidly, where only the top of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence pool can be gainfully employed (with a few service jobs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one side)?   Eventually there may not be anything a given worker can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained to do that pays a living wage and there may be no region that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires such workers.  What then?
</em><br>
<p>I don't buy it.
<br>
Just as famine is not caused by lack of food but lack of distribution,
<br>
so to are high unemployment and the business cycle dependent on the
<br>
distribution of workers to where they are needed. For example, for the
<br>
past 5 years, unemployment in my local area has been below 1%, and a
<br>
minimum of a third of help wanted ads are for highly skilled positions,
<br>
and fast food restaurants are even paying $9.00 an hour plus benefits
<br>
and can't find help. I've regularly broadcast this fact in many fora
<br>
across the internet. Not one person who has ever received this
<br>
information taken advantage of it, yet I continue to hear of people
<br>
whining about getting employment in other areas of the country.
<br>
<p>When areas like mine run into a brick wall of the labor supply, if they
<br>
cannot ship enough bodies in (or cannot find enough houses to place them
<br>
in due to development restrictions), then firms must outsource work to
<br>
other regions. This causes an outflow of capital and labor cost and cost
<br>
of living inflation that triggers the next local recession. When you get
<br>
enough highly productive places running into this brick wall at the same
<br>
time, then you get a nationwide recession, and those allegedly oppressed
<br>
people in depressed areas who refused to get off their butts and move
<br>
wind up ever poorer as a result. If we had a proper system of labor
<br>
distribution in this country, the boom and bust business cycle could be
<br>
mitigated significantly.
