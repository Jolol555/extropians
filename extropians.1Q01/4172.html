</em><br>
<p>Actually, you are right.  I find that almost all belief systems are 
<br>
totally consistent within themselves.  While they may be based on 
<br>
unfounded assumptions or erroneous facts, most people really think 
<br>
consistently.  I know this is a minority view, especially on this 
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>In my experience, it is too easy to simply dismiss someone's 
<br>
viewpoints as being illogical or inconsistent.  I find that if I dig 
<br>
deeper, I usually can find a consistent position that guides all of 
<br>
their views.  This becomes extremely helpful when dealing with such 
<br>
people, or when trying to predict their future behavior.
<br>
<p>For example, it is easy to say that churches really don't believe in 
<br>
God, but are really shams to gain money and power.  This is not 
<br>
really the motivating factor in most churches.  Although this would 
<br>
seem to explain many of their actions and policies, it fails 
<br>
miserably to predict charity projects that use church funds, or 
<br>
refusal to take certain actions to protect themselves because it 
<br>
would violate some specific belief of theirs.  From their position 
<br>
that there is a God who overrides scientific law, it makes logical 
<br>
sense to follow the Bible even against the odds, because from their 
<br>
viewpoint they really have a secret Ace in the hole.
<br>
<p>Most people project their own beliefs and factual understandings onto 
<br>
other people, and then try to retrofit motivations that would explain 
<br>
the others' behaviors.  This doesn't work, because the others aren't 
<br>
working with the same beliefs or facts.  Another example of this 
<br>
would be Fox Mulder, the charcter in The X-Files.  I have seen him 
<br>
bashed on this list many times for blindly ignoring science and 
<br>
insisting on irrational beliefs.  This is a misguided criticism. 
<br>
Mulder is a fictional character in a fictional world.  In that 
<br>
fictional world, UFOs really exist.  He and his partner have 
<br>
personally seen little green men, shape-shifting monsters, and 
<br>
psychic phenomenon.  I watch the show for entertainment, and have 
<br>
rarely seen Mulder act irrationally.  In his world, the facts really 
<br>
do support his beliefs.  People on this list are inappropriately 
<br>
projecting their world-view, that UFOs and monsters are unproven in 
<br>
our world, onto Mulder's motives.  If such things don't really exist, 
<br>
then Mulder must be deliberately distorting the facts to try to 
<br>
believe in them.  Such a projection does not produce a true picture 
<br>
of Mulder's motivations, and will fail miserably to predict future 
<br>
actions of the character.
<br>
<p>When I see people doing this in real life, it bothers me.  I know 
<br>
they are projecting their own beliefs onto others.  I know they will 
<br>
then start arguing against facts that are really red herrings, 
<br>
because their opponents don't espouse the facts being refuted.  Such 
<br>
people end up arguing against a perceived position that never really 
<br>
existed and never really was presented.  They end up not refuting the 
<br>
opposing side, but totally missing the points and appearing 
<br>
nonresponsive.  Such people make their belief system appear 
<br>
faith-based and irrational because they are not really logically 
<br>
addressing facts presented by the opposing side.
<br>
<p>The flaw in trying to point out this behavior is that most people 
<br>
will assume one is defending the other side.  For some reason, most 
<br>
people can only visualize two sides to any issue.  If one points out 
<br>
a flaw in one side's argument, it must mean that one is a proponent 
<br>
of the other side.  I fully expect someone to read this long rambling 
<br>
and conclude that I am defending PETA against the criticisms leveled 
<br>
here.  My real intent was to answer the above point.  Yes, it is true 
<br>
that I am assuming that these people think about their beliefs in a 
<br>
logical way and try to resolve the inconsistencies they find.  It is 
<br>
erroneous to assumed that all logical thought leads to the same 
<br>
conclusion.  Different people have different &quot;facts&quot; and give 
<br>
different weights to different sets of evidence.  Even when using the 
<br>
same rules of logic, it is a wonder that we ever reach agreement at 
<br>
all.
