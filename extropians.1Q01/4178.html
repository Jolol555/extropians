<br>
<p>&quot;...The iButton® is a 16mm computer chip armored in a stainless steel
<br>
can.
<br>
Let's start with the package. Because of this unique, durable package,
<br>
up-to-date information can travel with a person or object. The steel
<br>
button is rugged enough to withstand harsh outdoor environments; it is
<br>
durable enough for a person to wear everyday on a digital accessory
<br>
like a ring, key fob, wallet, watch, metal card or badge (all of
<br>
which, incidentally, you can purchase from this site).
<br>
<p>Now let's move to the computer chip inside the package. There are
<br>
multiple different iButtons available. Each starts with a
<br>
guaranteed-unique registration number engraved in the silicon. From
<br>
there, iButtons branch out into three different types:...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>&quot;...The Java-powered Ring is, not surprisingly, the Java-powered iButton
<br>
mounted on a jewelry-grade, stainless steel ring. (The ring is also
<br>
available in solid gold, if you want to enter a room and make a
<br>
statement.) Why a ring? The whole idea is that you wear your
<br>
credential on a carefully guarded accessory, something you've spent
<br>
your entire life practicing how not to lose; and something rugged
<br>
enough to stand up to everyday wear. The memory iButton is also
<br>
available in ring form: the Digital Decoder Ring. If you don't like
<br>
rings, we also offer an iButton watch, wallet, engraveable metal card,
<br>
and key fob so you can wear your iButton in the form that best suits
<br>
you.....
