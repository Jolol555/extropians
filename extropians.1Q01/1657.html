<em>&gt; Hello, fellow Extropians. I am in my final semester of a CS degree and need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a programming project for my senior project course. My advisor says I need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sponsoring organization for my senior project. I would prefer to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sort of dynamic web site with a database. I am not an expert in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language but would like to learn/work in ASP/MS Access; it seems easiest;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plus most of the recent grads from my school seem to getting ASP jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are free websites that run ASP/MS Access and allow 30 Megs of storage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have to finish by early May or thereabouts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All I really need is a set of data that needs to be placed on a website.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, alternatively, any programming project for some organization would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any ideas?
</em><br>
<p>First, ASP/MS Access isn't your best choice.  If you need something
<br>
simple, try MySQL for the database, Perl CGI scripts to display the
<br>
content, and DBI to connect them.  MySQL itself is freely available
<br>
(www.mysql.com) as is Apache (www.apache.org) and Perl (www.perl.org -
<br>
if you're using a Windows machine, www.activestate.com has a good
<br>
Windows distribution).  Benefits: easier to get working, wider current
<br>
demand (Apache has been the most widely used Web server since before
<br>
MS came out with its offering, and still remains #1), and higher
<br>
potential from learning this (see reason three).
<br>
<p>Second, scout around your neighborhood for nonprofits and local
<br>
government.  There's probably some small group that wants a Web site
<br>
but doesn't know how it could implement one.  It's easiest if they
<br>
already have a 24/7 (that is, not a dialup or modem) Internet
<br>
connection, since you can load this onto one of their machines.
<br>
<p>Third, take this chance to learn how the basics of the technology works
<br>
- *NOT* just how to use it.  (This is a large part of why I reccomend
<br>
against developing with MS equivalents of free software: their
<br>
developer software tends to hide and distort explanations of how the
<br>
stuff actually works.)  This way, dreaming up nifty new things to do
<br>
with the tech will be much easier.  It's like the difference between
<br>
studying Pavlovian training and studing neurobiology, for a future
<br>
brain surgeon.
