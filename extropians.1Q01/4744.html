<p>Next on PGP creator's agenda: a secure phone
<br>
eWEEK
<br>
February 23, 2001 9:17 AM PT
<br>
URL: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2689294,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2689294,00.html</a>
<br>
<p><p>When Phil Zimmermann published Pretty Good Privacy, the first encrypted
<br>
e-mail program, in 1991, he had no idea it would become the most popular
<br>
product of its kind. Nor did he know that it would spark a three-year
<br>
investigation by the U.S. government into whether he had broken federal
<br>
laws against exporting strong encryption. Having come through the
<br>
inquiry
<br>
unscathed, Zimmermann eventually sold his company, PGP Inc., to Network
<br>
Associates Inc., staying on at the software concern to oversee
<br>
development
<br>
of future versions of his program. Earlier this week, Zimmermann left
<br>
NAI
<br>
for Hush Communications Inc., where he will become chief cryptographer.
<br>
Senior Writer Dennis Fisher talked with Zimmermann about why he left NAI
<br>
and his plans for the future.
<br>
<p>eWEEK: Why did you decide to leave Network Associates now?
<br>
<p>Zimmermann: I've had a long-standing position on publishing source code
<br>
for
<br>
crypto software. They didn't necessarily agree with that. I've been
<br>
working
<br>
on the same project [PGP] for 10 years, and as long as I continued to
<br>
work
<br>
there, they would own everything I do. I can't stay there forever.
<br>
<p>eWEEK: Is there a sense of sadness at all now that you won't be working
<br>
on
<br>
PGP anymore?
<br>
<p>Zimmermann: There is a sense of sadness, but I've been carrying the
<br>
project
<br>
for a long time. I have a special attachment to it. But I'm not going to
<br>
end my relationship with PGP. I talked to some of the engineers there
<br>
just
<br>
today. And I'll be helping Hush implement the OpenPGP standard. I've
<br>
taken
<br>
PGP as far as I can at NAI. They have a very different application at
<br>
Hush.
<br>
I have to get on with my career.
<br>
<p>eWEEK: When you first wrote PGP, did you ever think encrypted e-mail
<br>
would
<br>
become as popular as it has?
<br>
<p>Zimmermann: I thought it might become important, but what I didn't
<br>
anticipate was the interest the government would take in it. Honestly, I
<br>
was hoping it would be bigger than it is, but I think the ease-of-use
<br>
factor has held it back.
<br>
<p>eWEEK: That's been one of the criticisms of PKI (public-key
<br>
infrastructure)
<br>
in general for a long time. Do you think that has hurt its growth?
<br>
<p>Zimmermann: It's tough for anyone to roll out PKI in a big enterprise.
<br>
That's what I find interesting about Hush: If you have Web-based mail,
<br>
you
<br>
don't have to install anything on the workstation. That's a lot easier
<br>
from
<br>
the IT manager's perspective.
<br>
<p>eWEEK: What other projects are you working on now?
<br>
<p>Zimmermann: I'm working on a secure phone. It's totally written in Java.
<br>
I
<br>
did one before in C, but it never went anywhere because IT managers
<br>
weren't
<br>
interested in it. It became an orphan product, and when NAI bought my
<br>
company, they didn't even know they had it. It should be out sometime in
<br>
the spring. We're starting to put the crypto in now. That's the easy
<br>
part
<br>
for me. The telephony is the hard part.
