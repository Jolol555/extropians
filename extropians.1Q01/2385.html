</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh yes, another question. What would these different functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics be? Ie, how does 'life' differ from 'non-life', other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by definition?
</em><br>
<p>I would offer one, at least.  Life is self-generated, goal-directed action.
<br>
I'm only putting this out as a working definition.  I would say that the
<br>
self-generated part is to distinguish life from, say, a rock rolling
<br>
downhill.  The rock is acting, but not in a self-generated fashion.  It's
<br>
motion is very unlike, e.g., that of plant turning it leaves toward the
<br>
light.  &quot;Goal-directed&quot; because some actions have no goal, such as, to use
<br>
the same example, the rock's internal changes as it ages.  The plant's
<br>
turning of leaves is directed toward its continued flourishing.  Whether the
<br>
rock reaches the bottom of the hill or undergoes chemical changes really
<br>
does not change it much as a rock.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this my offering, actually borrowed much from Rand, Binswanger, and
<br>
Company.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me, it seems that things are the way they are; little more can be said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about them. If you label something 'life' or 'non-life', that doesn't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me to mean a thing. Labeling something as 'alive' only means that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view it another way, in a way that might facilitate deeper insight (or
</em><br>
not);
<br>
<em>&gt; it doesn't change the nature of that thing.
</em><br>
<p>Labeling something does not change its nature.  Big surprise!:)  The thing
<br>
is one classifies things in hopes of understanding something about them
<br>
better.  And one does not always have to have an explicit definition to do
<br>
this.  For instance, though I do not have a rock solid definition of
<br>
&quot;planet,&quot; I can classify Mars and Earth as planets and not, say, stars.
<br>
Surely, there are borderline cases.  Is a brown dwarf really a planet or a
<br>
star?  What about transneptunian objects?  Still, even with this rough
<br>
categorization, I can see there are certain salient differences -- such as
<br>
mass, energy production, composition -- between planets and stars -- even if
<br>
the line between them is hard to draw.
<br>
<p>Also, as more information is gathered, I might have to change my
<br>
classifications a little or a lot.  For instance, I started with Mars and
<br>
Earth.  How would Jupiter fit into this scheme?  It's mass is much more than
<br>
that of either Mars or Earth.  Its composition is very different too.  Does
<br>
this suddenly nullify the differences I noticed between the Earth/Mars and
<br>
stars like the Sun?  No, but it puts them in a wider context.  As my
<br>
knowledge [hopefully] grows, my definitions will become better -- more
<br>
finely tuned.
<br>
<p>One should not start with the notion that definitions are only good if they
<br>
are some kind of static, eternal, Platonic Forms that must be offered up a
<br>
priori or not at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or am I wrong? Is there a fundamental difference between 'life' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'non-life'? If so, what is the magic limit between 'life' and 'non-life'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not aware of any definition that provides a clean cut. But maybe that
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; just my lack of knowledge, maybe there is such a magical definition?
</em><br>
<p>Using &quot;magical&quot; here kind of tells me you are not serious.
<br>
<p>Definitions need not be clear cut to be helpful or to reflect real
<br>
differences.  It may be hard to show where the valley ends and the mountain
<br>
begins, but this doesn't negate that there is a difference.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
