</em><br>
<p>Mark, this is really a very dubious response to a terrible quandary. Most
<br>
scientists qualified to judge the matter appear to agree that European
<br>
settlement in Australia's terrifyingly fragile environment has savaged it
<br>
to the point where it actually is approaching unsustainability. 
<br>
<p>Such an assessment is always, of necessity, open to revision as new
<br>
technologies emerge that do more with less, or intervene powerfully at
<br>
critical points not previously understood, and so on. But do we wish to bet
<br>
our lives on it? What Phil Rhoades was describing ruefully in his quite
<br>
measured posts on Cryonet is arguably best seen as an economics of
<br>
despoliation equal to oafs living for years inside the ruins of a
<br>
magnificent palace, each winter tearing apart more paintings and antique
<br>
furniture and floorboards to light cooking fires. Hey, they're doing okay!
<br>
Look, there's another whole room of books in there they can burn next year!
<br>
<p>Can we depend with utter confidence on the AI gods of the Spike to step in
<br>
and make us new furniture and books using hyper-nano at the very edge of
<br>
disaster? Maybe. It's just as likely that any such critters will eat the
<br>
whole planet even faster. I hope not. I do hope we can morph these
<br>
accelerating technologies toward a civil and decent outcome. But in the
<br>
meantime, I believe we do the planet a disservice by bad mouthing those who
<br>
point out that the reason the emperor hasn't frozen to death, despite his
<br>
lack of clothing, is that he's huddled beside those blazing library books.
