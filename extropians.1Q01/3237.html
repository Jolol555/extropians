Anyway, catagorize this along with
<br>
<p>&quot;flaircraft&quot; that &quot;fly&quot; with weird wings that push against high pressure 
<br>
squeezed between them and the ground a few feet below. Make it big enough 
<br>
and it can transport a lot passingers in comfort.
<br>
<p>passenger and cargo submarines that go fast and save fuel because they are 
<br>
under the surface turbulence.
<br>
<p>Giant planes with giant clear bubble domes on top and swimming pools.
<br>
<p>Standing tough under stars and stripes
<br>
We can tell
<br>
This dream's in sight
<br>
You've got to admit it
<br>
At this point in time that it's clear
<br>
The future looks bright
<br>
On that train all graphite and glitter
<br>
Undersea by rail
<br>
Ninety minutes from New York to Paris
<br>
Well by seventy-six we'll be A.O.K.
<br>
What a beautiful world this will be
<br>
What a glorious time to be free
<br>
Get your ticket to that wheel in space
<br>
While there's time
<br>
The fix is in
<br>
You'll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky
<br>
You know we've got to win
<br>
Here at home we'll play in the city
<br>
Powered by the sun
<br>
Perfect weather for a streamlined world
<br>
There'll be spandex jackets one for everyone
<br>
What a beautiful world this will be
<br>
What a glorious time to be free
<br>
On that train all graphite and glitter
<br>
Undersea by rail
<br>
Ninety minutes from New York to Paris
<br>
(More leisure for artists everywhere)
<br>
A just machine to make big decisions
<br>
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision
<br>
We'll be clean when their work is done
<br>
We'll be eternally free yes and eternally young
<br>
What a beautiful world this will be
<br>
What a glorious time to be free
<br>
