<em>&gt; &gt;I've just finished re-reading (for the several-eth time) Barne's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;Mother of Storms&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In it there are several topics which relate to Extropianism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the Singularity.  One in particular that I want to mention at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time is the &quot;Personal Defender&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Said item is a small handgun.  It has several interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;features.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1. It is factory loaded.....once it's loads have been expended it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is non reloadable....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;2. Upon being fired it does three things....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a.it projects an ultra velocity bullet of depleted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;uranium....supossedly &quot;utterly lethal&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;b. it emits a radio frequency message intended to be received by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the police..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;c. it indeliably marks it's user via dye and taggats (of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sort....the hypothetical &quot;smart&quot; variety I would assume.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;3. It is readily available to anyone.....&quot;easily purchased by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;teenager at a seven-eleven&quot; .......
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This to me seem to have several advantages....all positive over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the long run...and only minor disadvantages in the short run...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Any comments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My first comment is that this is a damm fine post. You may wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; join us at <a href="mailto:exi-freedom@egroups.com?Subject=Re:%20GUNS:%20Re:%20Self%20Defense&In-Reply-To=&lt;3A6754BE.7E4C79A6@datamann.com&gt;">exi-freedom@egroups.com</a> for the ones that aren't so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine. ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My problem would be in the non-reloadable feature for one, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem that having used it once you would have to replace it or risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being short rounds if you run into multiple attackers. Or have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry multiple launchers.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the non-reloadable feature is only of use to manufacturers to make
<br>
more money. The smart thing to do is sell non-reloadable magazines that
<br>
only fit that gun, and every bullet and brass cartridge is serialized,
<br>
where anyone can buy the gun, but an ID is required to buy ammo.
<br>
<p>However, many studies of similar ammo control measures that were once
<br>
part of the GCA of 1968 proved conclusively that they had no impact on
<br>
crime, nor were they helpful in solving crime. This may change if
<br>
bullets are more reliably serialized, but thats an idea that has not
<br>
been tested yet.
