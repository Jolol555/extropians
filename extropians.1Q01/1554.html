<p>Dean Ing!  He is a FOAF, used to work here at the rocket ranch.

<p>We did end up having rolling blackouts here.  Apple Computer
<br>
got it today.  Since power has been artificially cheap here for
<br>
so long, no one has invested in diesel generators and power
<br>
conditioning equipment.  Consequently the losses go into
<br>
the jillions.  The backup equipment would have cost pennied
<br>
on the dollar of what was lost today alone.
<br>
<p>The hell of it is: suppose some enterprising individual foreseen
<br>
this day and invested in a buttload of independent
<br>
power generation equipment.  She would be speculating
<br>
that in the day the inevitable came to pass, she could offer
<br>
all the power you want, a buck a kilowatt hour.  She coulda
<br>
cleaned up, eh?  NO!  The way the Taxifornia government
<br>
is going, it woulda siezed the assets, or arrested the enterprising
<br>
individual for profiteering.  Consequentamente...  No one
<br>
invested in the equipment, and now we lose jillions of
<br>
dollars worth of productivity.  spike
