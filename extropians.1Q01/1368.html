----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Extremism&In-Reply-To=&lt;010101c07f9c$ec93aa60$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;

<p><p><em>&gt; I don't, however, get all anal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retentive about it, I don't rant on and on about how they get off over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it or make aspersions to their sexual adequacy. Because I don't exhibit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such behavior, and people like Joe and yourself do, I find it hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take seriously him or anyone who allies themeselves with him.
</em><br>
<p><p>Oh please.  'Allies' themselves?  What is this-- a game of Diplomacy?  While
<br>
I understand your need to pigeon-hole my position on this matter to save
<br>
precious discretionary brain power, it really is not demonstrative of very
<br>
much imagination.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I did not restart this thread, and I have repeatedly requested that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be moved to exi-freedom, so I can't take your complaints of my behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously if you continue to pout and stamp your footies about it.
</em><br>
<p>You are hilarious.  Where do you get these tactics from Lorrey, the
<br>
playground?  Watching you pull out the &quot;don't be such a baby,&quot; defense over
<br>
and over again is quite amusing.  Obviously you've experienced some success
<br>
with it; you employ it with uncommon predictability.  Hey, its a great
<br>
tactic, and doesn't necessitate the forming of an actual -argument!-
<br>
instead, just claim that those who disagree with you are whiners-- if they
<br>
protest, do it again!  What fun.
<br>
<p>It would be remarkably refreshing to see you (or anyone else, for that
<br>
matter,) take -some- responsibility for the continuation of content that is
<br>
clearly a matter of personal interest and only tangentially related to
<br>
purpose of this list.
<br>
<p>Here, I'll start:
<br>
<p>I'd like to apologize for throwing in my two cents.  These interjections
<br>
rarely serve the intended purpose: it is clear that it will serve only to
<br>
increase noise on this list-- now we all have to endure Michael's
<br>
counter-attacks, my counter-attacks.... blah, blah, blah, boring, boring,
<br>
boring.
<br>
<p>My post was a reflexive reaction to what I perceive as increasingly
<br>
insidious list damage, and clearly unhelpful.
<br>
<p>I promise not to respond publicly to Michael's response to this post unless
<br>
he adds something other than ridicule to the discussion.
<br>
<p><p>On a lighter, related note, is anyone interested in/aware of a mailing list
<br>
dedicated to the intelligent discussion of the constructive application of
<br>
technology, culture and art towards improving and transcending the human
<br>
condition?  I think I'm still looking for a home-- would appreciate feedback
<br>
on this.
<br>
<p><p>Ta!
