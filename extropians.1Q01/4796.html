<p><em>&gt;Eliezer, Minsky was the same guy who was the dinner speaking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the first west coast Foresight Nanocon, which was in about 1990 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;91. He dismissed solar sailing by claiming that even if nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could produce a sheet of aluminum a single atom thick, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gravitational force of the sun would be greater than the light
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;inverse square of the distance, solar gravity is greater than
</em><br>

<p><p>THE PLANETARY SOCIETY AND COSMOS STUDIOS ANNOUNCE COSMOS 1 THE
<br>
FIRST  SOLAR SAIL SPACE MISSION
<br>
<p>For News and Updates on this mission,
<br>
visit <a href="http://planetary.org/">http://planetary.org/</a>
<br>
<p>Pasadena, CA. - February 26, 2001: The Planetary Society's Cosmos
<br>
1: The First Solar Sail mission, sponsored by Cosmos Studios, is
<br>
set to  test in April with the prime mission scheduled to launch
<br>
between October - December this year.
<br>
<p>The deployment test flight will launch from a Russian submarine in
<br>
the Barents Sea and will be lifted into a thirty-minute sub-orbital
<br>
flight from a Russian Volna rocket, a converted ICBM.   The main
<br>
mission, with the goal of first solar sail flight, will launch into
<br>
Earth orbit later this year, also from a Volna rocket.
<br>
<p>Once in orbit, the solar sail spacecraft will be as bright as the
<br>
full moon (although only a point in the sky) and will be visible
<br>
from places on Earth with the naked eye.  Images of the sail in
<br>
flight will be sent to Earth from two different cameras on-board
<br>
the spacecraft.
<br>
<p>The mission represents the first private mission of space
<br>
exploration technology and the first mission by a private space
<br>
interest organization. It will explore and develop technology that
<br>
could open the door to future flights throughout the solar system
<br>
and beyond. The mission will be carried out by a unique, privately
<br>
funded Russian-American space venture.
<br>
<p>&quot;This could be a pivotal moment for space exploration, said Louis
<br>
Friedman, Executive Director of The Planetary Society and Project
<br>
Director of Cosmos 1.  &quot;Solar Sailing is a grand adventure as well
<br>
as an important leap in technological innovation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Space sailing is done not with wind, but with reflected light
<br>
pressure - pushing on giant sails, changing the orbital energy and
<br>
spacecraft velocity continuously.   The sunlight pressure is
<br>
powerful enough to push spacecraft between the planets from Mercury
<br>
out to Jupiter.  Beyond Jupiter, and out to the stars, space
<br>
sailing can be done using powerful lasers focused over long
<br>
distances in space.
<br>
<p>&quot;The lasers themselves will be powered by solar energy - keeping
<br>
the spirit of solar sailing alive to other stars,&quot; added Friedman.
<br>
<p>&quot;The many special aspects of this first attempted solar sail flight
<br>
-Russian-American collaboration; use of weapons of war for
<br>
launching peaceful technologies for humankind's future; attempting
<br>
a very low cost, privately funded space initiative in a one-year
<br>
time schedule; realizing one of Carl Sagan's dreams; working with
<br>
Ann Druyan,  Sagan's wife and long-time collaborator, who, together
<br>
with Joe  Firmage, had the courage to fund this project - make us
<br>
extremely proud of what we have accomplished before we've even
<br>
launched,&quot;  said Friedman.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. 
<br>
We are ready at last to set sail for the stars,&quot; wrote Sagan and
<br>
Druyan in their television series, Cosmos.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is a Kitty Hawk moment to us.  We feel as if we've been given
<br>
the chance to outfit the Wright Brothers' Bicycle Shop,&quot; said Ann
<br>
Druyan, CEO of Cosmos Studios, Inc. &quot;We at Cosmos Studios are
<br>
honored to work with the brilliant scientists and engineers of many
<br>
countries brought together by The Planetary Society for one great
<br>
purpose.  We are proud to be part of this historic mission, which
<br>
is a critical baby step to the stars.  It's also emblematic of
<br>
Cosmos Studios' philosophy: to support good science, clean high
<br>
technology and bold exploration, and to engage the widest possible
<br>
audience in the romance of the adventure.&quot;
<br>
<p>The low cost of this mission is made possible due to the Russians
<br>
ability to &quot;piggy-back&quot; on a successful program in developing an
<br>
inflatable re-entry vehicle.   Once injected into Earth's orbit,
<br>
the sail will be deployed by inflatable tubes, pulling out the sail
<br>
material and then rigidizing the structure.  The sail is
<br>
constructed into eight &quot;blades&quot; or &quot;petals&quot; - roughly triangular in
<br>
shape. They can be turned (pitched) like helicopter blades, and
<br>
depending on how they are turned, the sunlight will reflect in
<br>
different directions. This is how the attitude of the spacecraft is
<br>
controlled and how the sail can &quot;tack.&quot;
<br>
<p>Low cost is also made possible by use of the Volna rocket,
<br>
manufactured by the Makeev Rocket Bureau in Russia.   The Babakin
<br>
Space Center is the prime contractor for the project - the company
<br>
is a spin-off organization of NPO Lavochkin, the largest
<br>
manufacturer of robotic spacecraft in the world.
<br>
<p>The April launch will be a sub-orbital flight test of the
<br>
deployment of two solar sail blades.  An inflatable re-entry shield
<br>
is planned to bring the pictures of the deployment back to a
<br>
landing and  recovery site in Kamchatka.  The actual solar sail
<br>
flight will commence from an 850 km circular orbit, with a launch
<br>
being planned in a window between October - December of this year. 
<br>
The sail will be 600 square meters of aluminized mylar, constructed
<br>
into 8 blades.
<br>
<p>Solar sailing enables space travel without fuel.   Applications
<br>
from space weather satellites that can hold position against the
<br>
force of gravity, to interplanetary shuttles carrying cargo between
<br>
the planets and the asteroids and comets are all part of the solar
<br>
sailing future.  By diving in close to the Sun, future solar sails
<br>
will achieve enormous velocities enabling rendezvous with any solar
<br>
system object, or, as mentioned above, a flight to the stars.
<br>
<p>Cosmos 1 is staffed by a world team of Americans and Russians.  
<br>
The Planetary Society website has a dedicated section to this
<br>
mission, which includes an animation of the mission, spacecraft
<br>
details, updates and news releases. It will allow the world public
<br>
to follow  and participate in this mission. This site is open to
<br>
the public and is located at <a href="http://planetary.org">http://planetary.org</a>.
<br>
<p>This will be the first space mission that will utilize a website to
<br>
continuously interface the sequence of the mission with the general
<br>
public, allowing continued and uninterrupted public participation.
<br>
Additional information will also be available at the Cosmos Studios
<br>
website located at <a href="http://carlsagan.com">http://carlsagan.com</a>.
<br>
<p>The Planetary Society is headquartered in Pasadena, California,
<br>
U.S.A.  The organization was co-founded by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray
<br>
and Louis Friedman in 1980 to advance the exploration of the solar
<br>
system, and to continue the search for extraterrestrial life.  With
<br>
100,000 members in over 140 countries, the Society is the largest
<br>
space interest group in the world.
<br>
<p>Cosmos Studios creates science-based entertainment that seeks to
<br>
thrill and engage the broadest possible audience through the
<br>
convergence of television, cinema and the Internet.  The company
<br>
creates programming that makes news, entertains, uplifts and
<br>
inspires humankind's quest for knowledge, our understanding of
<br>
cosmic evolution, and our place in its great story. Cosmos Studios
<br>
is based in Los Angeles, California and is managed from Ithaca, New
<br>
York.
