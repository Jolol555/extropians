From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Philosophy:%20It%20doesn't%20suck%20so%20bad%20we%20can't%20ignore%20it&In-Reply-To=&lt;062901c07507$ac7a7020$88bc473f@jrmolloy&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps philosophy is useful in designing a system of ideas or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorizing a possible system of ideas, but only the scientific method
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will discover actual existing systems in the universe or confirm the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; validity of any proposed system.
</em><br>
<p>Well, in that case, I think we could replace the word &quot;philosophy&quot; with
<br>
the term &quot;rational thinking and theorizing.&quot; We don't need to hypothesize
<br>
that a mysterious substance called &quot;philosophy&quot; somehow operates in
<br>
metaphysical conjunction with system design and rational thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now that I think I am getting a clearer picture of your assessment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy, I think your statement makes a lot more sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Philosophy may be &quot;wrong&quot; for certain purposes, but for designing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software, applying law, discussion ethics, debating methods, starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a futurist movement, etc., it may be a useful tool.
</em><br>
<p>I see philosophy as a boat to carry humanity from religionism to science.
<br>
When the boat of philosophy has carried us from the shore of religionism
<br>
to the shore of science, then we can get out of the boat, and leave it
<br>
behind. The questions that we asked while in the boat made sense, but now
<br>
all those questions are the wrong questions.
<br>
As alien intelligence continues to evolve, authority will increasingly
<br>
belong to the one who best answers those who question authority.
<br>
Meanwhile, increasingly intelligent expert systems continue to feed us
<br>
news of the worlds we love, while philosophy keeps conforming to
<br>
definitions of philosophers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with much that you are saying.  However, I don't think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are aware of how much philosophizing is done in science to hash out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible theories.
</em><br>
<p>I think hashing out plausible theories, by any other name (including
<br>
&quot;philosophizing&quot;), is still hashing out plausible theories (AKA,
<br>
theorizing). I'm beginning to disbelieve in philosophy altogether. Why,
<br>
just the other day I heard someone mention &quot;Eastern philosophy&quot; -- as if
<br>
philosophy is somehow to do with geography. Imagine... if you plant
<br>
philosophers in Madras, India, they philosophize one way; and if you plant
<br>
them in Wisconsin, they philosophize in another way.
<br>
<p>I don't think this works with science. A scientific experiment will work
<br>
the same in India as in America.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once a consistent theory is proposed, it is then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigated.  The rules of logic, deduction, consistency, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Occam's razor are used to explore the possible universe first.
</em><br>
<p>In contrast, one could use a computer model to simulate all known
<br>
variables in a system. This might work better as a way to explore the
<br>
possible universe first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Expensive experiments are done later after the most likely reality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicted.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, there's only one reality, so we don't need to predict it, but I
<br>
know what you mean. Here again, I'd trust scientifically devised tests to
<br>
determine the most likely outcome of an expensive experiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would it be more accurate to frame your position as being that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy without the testing of science asks useless questions?
</em><br>
<p>Now look what you've done. ô¿ô  To frame this position in such a way that
<br>
it invites no more questions will be difficult. First, it is not a
<br>
position so much as it is an observation. It does no good to say that
<br>
philosophy is the art of asking the wrong questions, if (for example)
<br>
people go on asking for a definition of philosophy.
<br>
By asking the correct questions, one discovers everything.
<br>
By asking the wrong questions, one constructs philosophy.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
