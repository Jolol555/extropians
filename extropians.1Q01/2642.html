<p><em>&gt;I love the way this stuff is unfolding. I used to have these experiences

<em>&gt;I do think we should be cautious about calling these neurological

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;No `god' need apply, unless It's been applied in heavy strokes ahead of

<br>
<p>Good points, all. Perhaps I should have gone beyond the journalist gloss
<br>
(religion = belief in God) to focus on the actual neurophysiology described
<br>
by the researchers. What you described, Damien, is the sense of wonder or
<br>
awe that is part of many profoundly moving experiential states. But I think
<br>
the sense of falling boundaries between self and world noted by the
<br>
researchers is a step deeper than mere awe.
<br>
<p>A person can feel moved by the starry sky without feeling one with it. The
<br>
sense of oneness or union is qualitatively different. (By the way, the stuff
<br>
about holding the new-born baby is, in my experience, bunk. I have held each
<br>
of my 3 immediately after birth and I felt deep love, but nothing mystical,
<br>
or unitary, which are states I have experienced during meditation.)
<br>
<p>What I find most intriguing about neurophysiological research on
<br>
meditative/religious states is that it may lead to the development of more
<br>
efficient means for entering these states, and more general, global
<br>
explanations of their origin and usefulness. History shows that people value
<br>
these states highly. My experience (and that of many others) shows me that
<br>
these states can be achieved by direct effort through meditation, but also
<br>
by ingestion of mind-altering substances under controlled conditions
<br>
(circumstantial and memetic). Here's the rub: People who enter these altered
<br>
states become extremely susceptible to outside memetic influences, which may
<br>
or may not prove benign in the long run. If the experiencer is in a
<br>
religious environment, then he or she can become a Christian, Muslim, Jew,
<br>
Hindu, Buddhist or any New Agey religion imaginable. But what would happen
<br>
if an individual entered an experiential state of feeling one with
<br>
everything (a state of nondifferentiation) while participating in an
<br>
Extropian &quot;meditation workshop&quot;? Would he or she become a more effective
<br>
advocate of transhumanist ideas, or a glaze-eyed fanatic?
<br>
