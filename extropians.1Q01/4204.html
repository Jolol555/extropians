Thanking Web Sites, With Cash

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALL me stingy, but I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't think of a single
<br>
time I suddenly got the urge
<br>
to pay for something I had
<br>
been getting free and could
<br>
continue to get free.
<br>
<p>But that is exactly what
<br>
Amazon.com had in mind
<br>
last week when it instigated
<br>
a new scheme called the
<br>
Honor System. It's a way for
<br>
people to use the
<br>
one-click-shopping
<br>
concept to make voluntary
<br>
payments from $1 to $50 for
<br>
intangible things - humor,
<br>
advice, recipes - that they
<br>
usually get free from
<br>
Internet sites like Hearing
<br>
Voices.com, an archive of
<br>
radio clips, and SatireWire,
<br>
which publishes humorous
<br>
articles.
<br>
<p>SatireWire's FAQ about
<br>
the program summed it up
<br>
nicely:
<br>
<p>Question: If I give money,
<br>
what do I get out of it?
<br>
<p>Answer: More SatireWire.
<br>
Better SatireWire. Maybe
<br>
both.
<br>
<p>Question: That's it?
<br>
<p>Answer: No, you can buy
<br>
one of those singing fish
<br>
wall plaques and pretend we
<br>
gave it to you.
<br>
<p>I like to think I have an
<br>
open mind. So when
<br>
Amazon.com's founder, Jeff
<br>
Bezos, phoned to encourage
<br>
me to use the Honor
<br>
System, I asked in as nice a
<br>
tone as I could muster what
<br>
would ever possess me to pay for something I could get free.
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, if you get something of value, you should pay for it,&quot;
<br>
Mr. Bezos said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Like love?&quot; I asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;Like pineapples,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Mr. Bezos explained that he got the idea for the Honor
<br>
System about two years ago while visiting Hawaii. &quot;I
<br>
stopped at a roadside stand,&quot; he said, &quot;and there was a little
<br>
sign that said: `Gone for two hours. Put money in the box
<br>
and take the pineapples you want.' The Web is sort of like
<br>
that. You can't just take the pineapples.&quot;
<br>
<p>Actually, it's not the same at all. People are used to paying
<br>
for pineapples. Pineapples are a tangible product with a
<br>
specific, market-driven price. Like, say, books.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why don't you implement an honor system for paying for
<br>
your books?&quot; I asked. &quot;Send me the book, and if I like it, I'll
<br>
send you money.&quot;
<br>
<p>But Mr. Bezos, who perhaps saw my argument for the
<br>
callow attempt it was to get something for nothing, pointed
<br>
out that an honor system is a less efficient way to pay for
<br>
something like a book, where the marginal cost of supplying
<br>
the product is relatively high. An honor system works for
<br>
situations in which a supplier has a fixed up-front cost and
<br>
is in effect offering products that cost nothing extra - like
<br>
surplus pineapples left over after the rest of the crop went
<br>
to the grocery store, or humorous articles whose cost will
<br>
not change after they are posted on a site.
<br>
<p>Mr. Bezos said he thought that the potential market was
<br>
big. Maybe, he said, it would help me to think of honor
<br>
system payments as tips, like the money that restaurant
<br>
diners leave on the table.
<br>
<p>Mr. Bezos was not the first to have this idea. At a site called
<br>
Tipjar.com, in operation for five years, you can pledge
<br>
money to anyone with an e- mail address. Unlike
<br>
Amazon.com, which charges the recipient a 15-cent
<br>
transaction fee and then skims a 15 percent commission
<br>
from the total donation, Tipjar.com is a free service.
<br>
Donors mail checks to the founder, David Nicol, who puts
<br>
the money in an interest-bearing account, then mails the
<br>
recipients a check once a month. &quot;About 10 people a day
<br>
send tips,&quot; Mr. Nicol said, &quot;typically of $2 or $3. If more
<br>
people used it, I would earn enough money from the
<br>
interest-bearing account to pay for my postage costs.&quot;
<br>
<p>That made me wonder if patrons leave tips based on what
<br>
they think the service is worth or, more likely, if they leave
<br>
15 percent to conform to a perceived price point
<br>
established by cultural precedent.
<br>
<p>In fact, a recent study of tipping behavior at the Cornell
<br>
University School of Hotel Administration, conducted by
<br>
Prof. Michael Lynn, found the quality of service made only
<br>
a minor difference in the amount people left, suggesting
<br>
that diners feel they are paying a fixed price established by
<br>
custom. But in another study he conducted, in which diners
<br>
at a Mexican restaurant in Ohio were given a choice of four
<br>
tip prices for a dish they had eaten, Professor Lynn found
<br>
that about 40 percent of people chose to pay more than they
<br>
had to, perhaps because they had consumed big portions or
<br>
because they didn't want to appear cheap.
<br>
<p>Curiously, diners who ordered a dish called El Puerco (&quot;the
<br>
pig&quot;) most often felt compelled to pay the highest price.
<br>
Whether ordering something called The Pig heightens your
<br>
sense of needing to make a good impression, Professor
<br>
Lynn said he didn't know. &quot;That dish was also a big
<br>
portion,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Similar tipping behavior has been observed among people
<br>
who obtain shareware, Professor Lynn said, noting that at
<br>
least one shareware author reported that nearly 40 percent
<br>
of users sent a bigger payment than requested for a software
<br>
program they found particularly useful.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's a norm of reciprocity in nearly every country,&quot;
<br>
Professor Lynn said, &quot;the idea that when people do you a
<br>
favor, you need to pay it back.&quot;
<br>
<p>I scanned Amazon.com's list of 50 participating Honor
<br>
System sites to find one to do me a favor.
<br>
<p>Yumyum.com caught my eye. With its database of nearly
<br>
20,000 eclectic, homey recipes organized into 16 categories,
<br>
like Soups and Stews and Cakes/Pies, Yumyum.com's
<br>
mission was to help the sort of home cook who is not too
<br>
snooty to occasionally use &quot;boxed cake mix&quot; as an
<br>
ingredient. Although some of the site's more fanciful
<br>
recipes were unsuitable for serving as an entrée to children
<br>
clamoring for dinner (Wesley's Secret Eggplant Recipe,
<br>
which called for drinking a liter of bourbon while grinding
<br>
up eggplants in a garbage disposal comes to mind), I printed
<br>
out recipes for lemon poppy seed muffins and for spicy
<br>
Sopa de Albóndigas, or Meatball Soup.
<br>
<p>But then I made meatloaf instead. Why was I having such a
<br>
hard time getting over the emotional hump of making a
<br>
donation? What kind of person would use the Honor
<br>
System?
<br>
<p>To find out, I phoned Geoffrey Falk, an office assistant who
<br>
sent $10 to SatireWire. He is a Canadian. &quot;Boy, it's tough to
<br>
say why I did it,&quot; Mr. Falk said. &quot;I guess SatireWire fills a
<br>
comedic void in my life. I wanted to show my appreciation.&quot;
<br>
<p>With that in mind, I made the lemon poppy seed muffins.
<br>
They were passable. So I went back to the Yumyum.com
<br>
home page and, with $1 in mind, clicked on the Click to
<br>
Give box that would take me to an Amazon.com server to
<br>
complete the credit card transaction. That's when I saw
<br>
that Yumyum.com had set a $3 minimum on contributions.
<br>
<p>I gave the dollar to SatireWire instead.
