&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay, i've got _sociobiology_ on my lap. below are some passages
<br>
from wilson's discussion of hamiltonian kin selection in the order
<br>
hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants, etc.).
<br>
<p><p>-x
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
[Chapter 20, The Social Insects]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Prime Movers of Higher Social Evolution in Insects]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This strange calculus, when extended to other kin (see Table
<br>
20-3), leads to even stranger conclusions. Consider, for example, the
<br>
prediction that males should be more consistently selfish than females
<br>
toward everyone else in the colony. This is expected to be the case
<br>
because under all conditions except complete queen domination of the
<br>
workers, a male's expected reproductive success is greater than that of a
<br>
similar sized female (see below). In order for selection to favor male
<br>
altruism, such altruism would have to confer greater benefits than similar
<br>
altruism by a female -- an  unlikely situation. Not only is this
<br>
prediction met in nature, its fulfillment seems explicable only by this
<br>
particular theory. The selfishness of male behavior is well know but has
<br>
never before been adequately explained -- in our language, the word
<br>
&quot;drone&quot; has come to designate any lazy, parasitic person. Not only do
<br>
hymenopteran males contribute virtually nothing to the labor of the
<br>
colony, but they are also highly competitive in begging food from female
<br>
members of the colony and become quite aggressive in contending with other
<br>
males for access to females during the nuptial flights. Nature has even
<br>
provided a control experiment: termites are not haplodiploid and yet have
<br>
equaled the hymenopterans in social evolution, for different reasons that
<br>
will be discussed later. According to the theory termite males should not
<br>
be drones. And they are not. Males constitute approximately half of the
<br>
worker force, contribute and equal share of the labor, and are as
<br>
altruistic to nestmates as are their sisters.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A second, nonobvious prediction of the theory is that worders of
<br>
hymenopteran colonies should favor their own sons over their brothers. In
<br>
other words, workers should lay unfertilized eggs and try to rear them to
<br>
the exclusion of the queen's unfertilized eggs. This bias follows in part
<br>
from the simple fact that females are related to their sons by a degree
<br>
of 1/2 but to their brothers by a degree of only 1/4. It is enhanced by
<br>
the relations between sister workers, in a manner to be explained
<br>
shortly. Although the result seems odd, it can be reasonably well
<br>
documented. Males are commonly derived from worker-laid eggs in nests of
<br>
paper wasps (Yamanka, 1928), bumblebees (Ronaldo Zucchi, personal
<br>
communication), stingless bees of the genus Trigona (Bieg, 1972), and ants
<br>
of the genera Oecophylla and Myrmica (Ledoux, 1950; Brian, 1968). The
<br>
origin of males from workers appears to be a widespread phenomenon in the
<br>
social Hymenoptera. But it is no universal; in the ant genera Pheidole and
<br>
Solenopsis, for example, ovaries are completely lacking in the worker
<br>
caste. &quot;
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In summary, the kin-selection hypothesis predicts that to the
<br>
extent that workers control the reproduction of the colony -- one might
<br>
even say to the extent they &quot;exploit&quot; the queen -- the ratio of investment
<br>
will fall between 1:1 and 3:1 in favor of queen production. If the mother
<br>
queen is in control, that is &quot;exploiting&quot; the workers, the ratio should be
<br>
the usual Fisherian 1:1. For various species of ants thus far measured,
<br>
the ratio is significantly greater than 1:1, and in many cases it falls
<br>
very close to 3:1 (Trivers, 1975).&quot;
