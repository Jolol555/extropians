</em><br>
<p>I think that the philosophy above could use the word &quot;discipline&quot; a 
<br>
couple of times.  Respecting a child as an intelligent human being is 
<br>
certainly important, but just like in adult life, children need to 
<br>
come up against hard realities that demand self-control.  Sometimes, 
<br>
toys have to be taken away.  Sometimes, baby has to be taken outside 
<br>
away from the fun until she can settle down.  And yes, sometimes, 
<br>
baby has to be left in her crib to cry for a few minutes before she 
<br>
falls asleep.
<br>
<p>I guess the reason I'm interjecting this is because your description 
<br>
above reminded me of the teaching philosophy in Norther California. 
<br>
My wife was a private school teacher in the Silicon Valley, and had a 
<br>
number of friends who had moved on to or come from the public school 
<br>
system.  Apparently it's gotten to be pretty bad.  You can't tell a 
<br>
child that he got an answer wrong.  You can't discipline a child for 
<br>
bad behavior.  You can't determine a curriculum, because the children 
<br>
have to be allowed to &quot;figure out what they want to learn.&quot;
<br>
<p>Like California's ridiculous energy policy that has created a 
<br>
disaster, California is also reaping years of this 
<br>
touchy-feely-experimental education policy.  They rank very near the 
<br>
bottom in academic performance studies, and one of the main reasons 
<br>
why I moved out of that area was that I didn't want my daughter to be 
<br>
educated in such an environment.
<br>
<p>My wife and I also studied the breast feeding issue before our 
<br>
daughter was born.  Everything we read indicated that breast feeding 
<br>
is a no-brainer choice, in terms of convenience, nutrition, and 
<br>
transfer of immunity - but everything we read and heard from health 
<br>
professionals indicated that anything beyond 9 months to a year was 
<br>
unproven to have any extra benefits, physiologically or 
<br>
psychologically.  I'd be interesting in seeing any scientific 
<br>
evidence that the 3-5 year figure that you mention above has any 
<br>
advantages.  I'd certainly be willing to change my mind on the 
<br>
subject given some evidence, but currently, I find a 5 year old 
<br>
tugging on his mom's bra to get a quick bite to eat to be more of a 
<br>
potential problem than a gain.
