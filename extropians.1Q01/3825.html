Americans Feel Cloning Is Against God's Will
<br>
<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Most Americans think that cloning a human being
<br>
is a bad idea, according to recent Time/CNN poll. However, when pressed
<br>
about particulars relating to the issue, many say cloning would be okay
<br>
under certain circumstances.
<br>
<p>For instance, 28% of those polled ``think cloning would be justified if it
<br>
were to produce vital organs used to save the lives of others.''
<br>
<p>About 21% said it would be acceptable if used to save the life of a person
<br>
being cloned and 20% felt was okay for an infertile couple to have a child
<br>
using cloning.
<br>
<p>There are many different reasons people feel cloning is a bad idea but most,
<br>
about one-third (34%), cite religious beliefs as their primary reason for
<br>
opposition.
<br>
<p>``Twenty-two percent say it is because cloning interferes with human
<br>
distinctiveness and individuality; another 22% because cloning could be used
<br>
for questionable purposes like breeding a superior race or cloning armies.
<br>
Overall, 69% think it is against God's will to clone human beings,''
<br>
according to a statement issued by Time.
<br>
<p>The Time/CNN poll was conducted by telephone on February 7th and 8th. The
<br>
poll of 1,015 adult Americans was conducted by Yankelovich Partners and had
<br>
a margin of error for the total sample of +/- 3.1%.
<br>
<p>The survey comes on the heels of highly publicized story earlier this month
<br>
that details a Canadian cult's desire to make the first cloned human from
<br>
the frozen cells of a dead baby. If successful, a clone of that dead child
<br>
will be the first baby produced by Clonaid, a for-profit subsidiary of the
<br>
Raelian cult. After the initial cloning, Clonaid will offer cloning services
<br>
to others at a fee of $200,000.
<br>
<p>When the Raelians announced the cloning plans last October the announcement
<br>
was greeted with some skepticism. But last week a pair of well-known
<br>
fertility experts, Dr. Panos Zavos of the University of Kentucky and
<br>
obstetrician Dr. Severino Antinori of Rome, Italy, added some credibility to
<br>
the possibility that a human will soon be cloned when they said that they
<br>
were undertaking a human cloning project.
<br>
<p>Whether or not the Raelian group proves to be successful remains to be seen.
<br>
Nevertheless, ``almost half (45%) of all Americans think it will be possible
<br>
to create a human clone within the next 10 years, but only 5% say they would
<br>
clone themselves if they had a chance,'' the pollsters report.
