<br>
<p>Of course remember: if you really intend on /helping/ the companies in
<br>
question, you have to invest during the IPO or before. Otherwise your
<br>
cash is just going to some other random person/org, not the company
<br>
itself.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Is this becuase you would just be purchasing stock owned by some random
<br>
person/org or is my fiscal ignorance even greater than I suspected?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been putting my financial house in order of late (getting my cryo
<br>
policy funded, working on land arrangements for a off-the-grid retirement
<br>
geodesic) in
<br>
the hopes of actually having the option of retiring when I retire from
<br>
active duty.
<br>
I am thinking about long-term investments like mutual funds. That way I
<br>
could work as I chose (like say consulting in space med or something)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a biomedicine geek not a MBA. I am bright and learn quickly but part
<br>
of the reason I am mil is it makes things nice and organized. I can plot my
<br>
income easily for the next 25 years. It's all very predictable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When will Zyvex go public? Please use them as an example...if they did the
<br>
IPO (is this the Intial Public Offering?) how would one know and buy in?
<br>
&nbsp;It would be nice to be sitting on shares of the next century's Big Blue.

<p><p>&nbsp;True, but if one has to invest, you can't beat the advice of Warren
<br>
Buffet, who does say to invest in companies that make things you use,
<br>
and he sure hasn't done too badly on that strategy.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;This is the broad strategy I thought of as most appropriate for me.
<br>
&nbsp;I read the time he said he held an investement was &quot;forever&quot;. Which may be
<br>
overstating things but is the right idea..real long term. I want to live
<br>
centuries and sit on my savings all that time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If there aren't mutual funds run by &quot;good folks&quot; then maybe I should go
<br>
the &quot;low-cal&quot; approach. Isn't it possible to sometimes purchase shares
<br>
directly from a company, without going through a broker? Isn't this
<br>
benefiting the company?
<br>
&nbsp;Or is this ignorant again?
<br>
&nbsp;I would rather &quot;save shares&quot; than worry over funds (simpler)..I just
<br>
assumed small investor discrete investing was fiscal suicide.
