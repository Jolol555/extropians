<p><em>    &gt;&gt; the  fact that  evolution can't explain it [that there is something rather

</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt;So far as I'm aware it doesn't attempt to explain
</em><br>
<p>Correct, evolution can no more explain the whole shebang than the God theory can,
<br>
it doesn't even try to, so why did you bring it up?  [ Yes Damien I read Smolin's book
<br>
but he's talking about the shebang not the whole shebang]

</em><br>
<p><em>   &gt;Absolutely.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand. Why should ancient Sumerian fairytales be more profound
<br>
than 19'th century European fairytales?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Einstein is generally acknowledged to have been,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; primarily, a mathematician.
</em><br>
<p>Baloney! Einstein was never interested in mathematics in itself,
<br>
only in what it could do. His contribution to pure mathematics is precisely
<br>
zero, he never even tried to do more.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;He had little professional contact or acces to the literature of physics
</em><br>
<p>Some truth to that, because of anti-Semitism he couldn't get a job at a
<br>
university and he was a bit out of the main stream of physics working at the
<br>
patent office, but to say he wasn't trained as a physicist is ridiculous, he got
<br>
his Ph.D. in 1905 for goodness sake. I'd call a Ph.D. training.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;the biggest  breakthroughs often come from those outside the fields
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;affected by the breakthroughs.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about that but I'll tell you one thing, the biggest crackpots certainly do.
<br>
<p>And by the way, that famous quote you like from Einstein &quot;God Does Not Play Dice&quot;
<br>
well we now know he was almost certainly wrong about that. God is a dice playing fool,
<br>
in fact He not only plays dice He sometimes rolls them where they can't be seen.
