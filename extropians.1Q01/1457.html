<p><em>&gt; Moravec paints some pretty scary pictures himself in the sequel

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Solar System (those with less of a taste for battle

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Really.  Could you point out where he says the Exes would lie in wait to
<br>
blast newcomers from earth?  I didn't see that.  And I find it extremely
<br>
unlikely.  Space is vast and extra hands and minds and viewpoints would
<br>
likely be highly prized.  Why waste energy squabbling at the doorway?  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apologies to Eliezer if I have overlooked his most recent positions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these matters -- I certainly didn't mean to suggest that **he** is a monster!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, perhaps the juxtaposition with de Garis and Warwick was a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misleading.  However, it's been my impression that being willing even to contemplate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end of humanity (whether by death or the metamorphosis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;human-ness&quot; into something else) -- to take a cosmic, Stapledonian view of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place of Man in the cosmos -- gets one pegged as somewhat cold-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blooded by a lot of people with more conventional horizons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I frankly do not see why fascination with and working toward the
<br>
metamorphosis of humanity into something that transcends humanity would
<br>
cause anyone to be labeled as &quot;cold-blooded&quot;.   Especially if room is
<br>
made for the stay-at-homes to do what they wish (outside of stopping
<br>
those who see things differently).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess the point I was trying to make is that it may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever be possible, or even desirable, to candy-coat this stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the masses.  Most people still get the screaming meemies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the sort of universe that modern science rubs Man's face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in -- particularly the Darwinian vision of life.  Any film buffs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember Katherine Hepburn as Violet Venable in the movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Tennessee Williams' _Suddenly Last Summer_ describing her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poet son Sebastian's reaction to seeing the birds swoop down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the newly-hatched sea turtles during a visit to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Encantadas?  That's what I mean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Most people have pretty funny ideas about what a &quot;Darwinian vision of
<br>
life&quot; is and is not.
