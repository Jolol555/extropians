Russell Whitaker &lt;<a href="mailto:russell_whitaker@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20ASTRO:%20recc.:%20Meade%20ETX-60AT%20Astro%20Telescope?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101102240.PAA29344@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">russell_whitaker@hotmail.com</a>&gt; asked about a
<br>
telescope that would:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm primary interested in observing Earth's moon, Mars, our gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giants and their larger moons, NEO Eros, as well as some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brighter stars (higher absolute magnitude) and galaxies.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I'd like to see is the International Space
<br>
Station (ISS).  I caught it the other night with a pair of binoculars
<br>
but still couldn't resolve anything other than a shaky (had troubles
<br>
holding the binoculars still) spot.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to the local mall nature shop which had some impressive
<br>
looking Mead Telescopes.  I asked if any of them could in any way
<br>
track the ISS.  &quot;Oh yeaaah!&quot; was his response pointing to 3 of them,
<br>
which really surprised and excited me.  But latter on he was saying
<br>
things like they couldn't track satellites, and that they would always
<br>
know where the ISS is (he apparently was unaware that the ISS has
<br>
thrusters and that it will use them to drastically change it's orbit
<br>
periodically.)  At this point I felt it futile to try to educate this
<br>
obviously ignorant salesperson about things like the ISS is a
<br>
satellite... with thrusters...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, my question is, are there any reasonably priced
<br>
telescopes (&lt; $1000) which could some how find and track the ISS?  One
<br>
that could also do what Russell wants to do?  The NASA web sight gives
<br>
precise location predictions, it seems like it might be possible to
<br>
feed these into a good tracking computer and have it find it this
<br>
way, and then have some way to optically track it as it zooms across
<br>
the sky for a minute or two?  Then again, maybe not?  Can any
<br>
telescopes do this at any price?
<br>
