<em>&gt;It strikes me as a strange opinion for anyone at all to have. If there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prejudice against people of Irish heritage, I'm unaware of it. Although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see how people recieving constant comments about something can get annoying,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meaning comments about something which implies you're supposed to have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;affiliation with what they're talking about, when you really have no idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what they mean (Example: When I went to college in Buffalo and talked to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-Buffalonians, they would frequently say &quot;Sorry about the Bills&quot;. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wasn't sure what a &quot;Bill&quot; was until I asked).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I love to tell the story about how my great grandfather came to the US from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ireland. England was being hard on Ireland at the time. An English soldier
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was burning all his crops as a result of some disagreement they had. My
</em><br>
<em>&gt;great grandfather (I never met him) shot the soldier, killed him, and left
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with his family to America that night.
</em><br>
Zeb,
<br>
<p>Cool story that.  Rare that anyone got the better of a British Army 
<br>
soldier, even in their own country!:)
<br>
<p>Slan,

<br>
<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
