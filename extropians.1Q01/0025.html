</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I got or read these messages in the wrong order.  I just got 
<br>
this one after I had already sent out my critique of your definition 
<br>
of philosophy.  The above paragraph helps a lot to give me a clearer 
<br>
definition about what you mean about asking the wrong questions.
<br>
<p>It almost seems to me that when defining &quot;wrong&quot; questions, you are 
<br>
assessing the usefulness of the method for finding answers.  You rate 
<br>
scientific method as most useful, philosophy as not useful, 
<br>
priestcraft as worse than useless, etc.
<br>
<p>Perhaps philosophy is useful in designing a system of ideas or 
<br>
theorizing a possible system of ideas, but only the scientific method 
<br>
will discover actual existing systems in the universe or confirm the 
<br>
validity of any proposed system.
<br>
<p>Now that I think I am getting a clearer picture of your assessment of 
<br>
philosophy, I think your statement makes a lot more sense. 
<br>
Philosophy may be &quot;wrong&quot; for certain purposes, but for designing 
<br>
software, applying law, discussion ethics, debating methods, starting 
<br>
a futurist movement, etc., it may be a useful tool.
<br>
<p>I agree with much that you are saying.  However, I don't think you 
<br>
are aware of how much philosophizing is done in science to hash out 
<br>
plausible theories.  Once a consistent theory is proposed, it is then 
<br>
investigated.  The rules of logic, deduction, consistency, and 
<br>
Occam's razor are used to explore the possible universe first. 
<br>
Expensive experiments are done later after the most likely reality is 
<br>
predicted.
<br>
<p>Would it be more accurate to frame your position as being that 
<br>
philosophy without the testing of science asks useless questions?
