<p>
I don't think it is the job of the employer to correct the educational
<br>
deficit.  I think it is primarily the responsibility of each of us to
<br>
continue learning.  Especially as the amount and rate of knowledge
<br>
explodes around us.  Good societal policies and even business policies
<br>
can help but they cannot remotely be held as the major determiners.  
<br>
<p>I read somewhere that over 50% of all college graduates (not high
<br>
school, college) in this country don't read one single book after
<br>
graduation.  That shows a singularly inactive mind.  How can minds be so
<br>
turned off or not ever turned on or distracted by whatever that this can
<br>
be true?  Especially so many minds? 
<br>
<p>I don't think it is the employer's responsibility in part because the
<br>
entire company/employer/employee relationship and model is largely and
<br>
increasingly outmoded.  Employment is not for life or even for 5-10
<br>
years.  Seeing this, how does it make sense for an employer to
<br>
personally set up and pay for major training of an employee?  It would
<br>
make as much or little sense to donate money generally to the education
<br>
of people.  It might be an incentive to stay with a company if the
<br>
training is really good however. 
<br>
<p>When it comes to the lack of basic skills the fault is not with
<br>
employers but with the government run, piss-poor public school system. 
<br>
A 96% lack of fundamental skills, not high-end ones, is a very major
<br>
indictment of education in this country.  Of course, part of the
<br>
highness of this figure could also be due to almost all of the good
<br>
people already being employed. But this still doesn't explain while
<br>
there are many millions of people without these basic skills needed to
<br>
even begin to comprehend the world around them, much less be employable.
<br>
<p>These are truly frighening statistics.  I have no idea how to fix such a
<br>
mess short of mandatory rewiring of brains or segregation of the less
<br>
mentally challenged people away from the general cultural chaos that is
<br>
most likely about to ensue.   I hope many of these numbers are
<br>
overplayed.  I fear they are not.
