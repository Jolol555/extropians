<p><em>&gt; Neal, from your comments so far on this lists, it seems that you

</em><br>
<p>And what exactly would be the problem with this?
<br>
<p>However, you're not reading closely enough. Just because I don't
<br>
automatically jump on the anti-liberal bandwagon doesn't mean I am
<br>
identifying myself totally with the left. This is simplistic thinking.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I mean give me a break, you said on this list, &quot;As far as I'm
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you just don't admit it.
</em><br>
<p>No, give me a break. I've already explained my position as to this whole
<br>
side-taking nonsense. If you refuse to get it, I can't help you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ironically, I think that your criticism mostly stems from the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Brian is poking a jab at &quot;your side&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Not true. If you've carefully read my other posts here you'd see that I am
<br>
reacting against knee-jerk side-taking. Just because I don't side with you
<br>
doesn't mean I am on the other side. This is the type of tired old
<br>
oppositional thinking I reject. It's just not very forward thinking.
