<em>&gt; &gt; Incidentally, this rumor runs wild on the Web, so you may wish to be armed

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The &quot;seal it in an envelope and mail it to myself&quot; trick is more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; useless.  I know of NO (zero, zip, nada) court cases where it has held up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Try this: take a plain envelope and mail it to yourself unsealed.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; post office doesn't care.  Now you can put anything you want into it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; any time in the future and have it &quot;date stamped&quot; today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also called Poor Man's Copyright.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed; unreliable in court. However, the above bit can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrably guarded against by sealing the envelope with strong tape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and asking the clerk to date-stamp it over envelope and tape. Tape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be removed without destroying envelope and date stamp.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still wouldn't rely on it.
</em><br>
<p><p>You are talking about a pretty small document.  Take it to a local
<br>
notary
<br>
and have it notarized and stamped.  Low-cost and effective.  
<br>
<p>Also, if there isn't such a thing as something I thought up 9 years ago
<br>
there should be.  It was an Idea Factory business.  The idea is that
<br>
people can post their ideas to the organization in however terse form,
<br>
with protection and acknowledgement built-in that they want.  Listings
<br>
of ideas will be published.  The listings may only describe enough to
<br>
get across the basic benefit of the idea.  Those interested in an idea
<br>
will pay some fee to get more information from the factory.  The factory
<br>
will set up negotiations between the would be buyer/user/implementer and
<br>
the creator of the idea again for a small fee.  The other variant of
<br>
this is that people can most problems they are looking for ideas on how
<br>
to fix.  I believe ideas.com does this sort of approach.  Another good
<br>
idea of mine that someone else finally does something with!
