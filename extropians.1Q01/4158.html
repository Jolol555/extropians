<a href="mailto:memoria@memoria.com?Subject=Re:%20Bill%20Joy%20again&In-Reply-To=&lt;bf.bb954c1.27c0e795@aol.com&gt;">memoria@memoria.com</a> quotes the Bill Joy article:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; a..  Biotechnology will allow for routine cut-and-pasting of genetic
<br>
&nbsp;material -- and the creation, by accident or intent, of virulent pathogens
<br>
&nbsp;that could decimate whole societies.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well we already have anthrax ready to be used. We have had this capabality 
<br>
since 1935-so what? Deployment from aircraft capability since 1942(est)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;&lt;b..  Self-replicating, intelligent robots will emerge in the laboratory,
<br>
&nbsp;then merge with people, then, conceivably, subjugate and even replace the
<br>
&nbsp;human species.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>And damnit, they won't be buying Sun Microsystem stock!! They'll be investing 
<br>
in my competitors! The strawberries...somebdy took the strawberries, and 
<br>
we'll find out who!  The nanotech might merge with humans and then engage in 
<br>
all night poker tournements (shudder).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;c..  Nanotechnology, through which scientists attempt to build machines the
<br>
&nbsp;size of molecules, may lead to enormous benefits. For instance,
<br>
&nbsp;micro-machines with the intelligence of supercomputers might conduct
<br>
&nbsp;search-and-destroy missions against cancer cells inside the body. But the
<br>
&nbsp;technology might also give rise to self-replicating micro-robots, or
<br>
&nbsp;``nanobots,'' created in the laboratory to, say, kill weeds. There's always
<br>
&nbsp;the chance, though, that the micro-robots will instead mutate, escape and
<br>
&nbsp;proliferate like mad, eradicating all plant life on the planet.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am guessing that even if grey goo becomes a genuine issue, one thing Joy 
<br>
misses on all counts, is that if the USA goes &quot;British&quot; on us, that is to say 
<br>
ant-tech, some other sodden region of the world might just continue research, 
<br>
attracting newly expatriate scientists from America. Lets say that China, or 
<br>
India or Pakistan, or South Africa, or Brazil, just to name a few places that 
<br>
may just say &quot;up yours Luddites, we're making da money!&quot;  I wonder if Joy 
<br>
would call down nuclear strikes or invasions on said placed, in order to save 
<br>
the world?
