<em>&gt;  &gt; What's the difference between this system and being in a small town,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  where the local police officers know who the typical &quot;trouble makers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  are?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The difference is that in a small town people KNOW each other. They pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each other on the street and say hi several times a week. They risk their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives together when there's an emergency such as a flood or major fire. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so forth. There's a HUGE difference between being arrested by someone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whom you're just a generic criminal and being arrested by someone whose kid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you took to the hospital the time he fell from a tree and broke his arm.
</em><br>
<p>What does knowing someone have to do with prosecuting them as a 
<br>
lawbreaker?  Are you implying that someone should get special 
<br>
leniency or treatment because he knows the police who caught him?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; What's the difference between this system and having a large team of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  police officers, who have thoroughly studied hundreds of photos of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  felons and wanted criminals, watching near the gate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not much difference here. And not much difference from situations where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people are encouraged (or frightened) into spying on their neighbors and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reporting them to the cops.
</em><br>
<p>Yikes, what a non-sequitur.  &quot;Frightened&quot;?  You're implying that 
<br>
having some intelligent surveillance cameras or plenty of ready 
<br>
officers on hand is like cops bullying people into ratting on their 
<br>
neighbors?  Doesn't that ignore the poor ethics of the cops in 
<br>
bullying someone to the point of fear?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But there's something wrong with all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pictures. A society that needs that sort of observation of its members in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order to enforce its rules must have some structural flaws.
</em><br>
<p>Uh... Yes?  Are you saying that our society lacks structural flaws? 
<br>
A society that needs *any* observation of its members in order to 
<br>
enforce its rules must have some structural flaws - it's just a 
<br>
matter of minimizing the impact of those flaws upon the law-abiding 
<br>
members of our society.
<br>
<p>Personally, I'm not satisfied with the safety level in our society. 
<br>
In the last ten years or so, I've had my car stolen, my car broken 
<br>
into and valuable items stolen, a friend who was mugged and slashed 
<br>
in broad daylight downtown, etc.  Those issues are fresh in my mind 
<br>
and impact my life quite often - affecting where I go and what I do.
<br>
<p>To contrast that, I've never had law enforcement agents take my 
<br>
property or make me feel like I might lose my life.  I can't think of 
<br>
any friends or friends of friends who've had serious encounters with 
<br>
law enforcement that they didn't bring upon themselves.  I'm not 
<br>
always enamored with policemen.  Sometimes they can be a bit haughty, 
<br>
but give me an asshole cop writing me a ticket versus someone 
<br>
stealing my car from IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE any day.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
