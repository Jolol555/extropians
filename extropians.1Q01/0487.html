<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... &quot;No...&quot;, Amara says sheepishly...

</em><br>
<p>Honestly!  I am really sorry about this sheep fiasco.  I cud not resist!
<br>
<p>Do allow me to redeem myself with an idea I had while hiking
<br>
today, alongside hilly pastures where flocks graze.  I recalled
<br>
hearing of western farmers having bad times because of
<br>
losses in their flocks and herds from predatory wolves and
<br>
coyotes.  The young calves sometimes get separated from
<br>
their mothers and stand forlornly on the periphery of the
<br>
herd, bleating and mooing.  The wolves hear this cry of
<br>
distress and close in, and soon are devouring the helpless
<br>
beast as the greiving mother bawls helplessly.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, seems to me like we could develop a robolamb
<br>
or robocalf which would look just like the carbon based
<br>
variety, and act like it too: it would wander alongside the
<br>
herd, bawling like an orphan.  But with an important difference:
<br>
the robolamb would have built-in image recognition, and
<br>
would be able to figure out when the wolf pack was closing
<br>
in!  The robolamb would bleat helplessly until the big bad
<br>
wolf came in for the kill, at which time it would turn to
<br>
face the approaching attacker and give the stalking
<br>
carnovore a snoot full of double ought buck.
<br>
<p>The farmers would love such a device!  Especially if the
<br>
image recognition software in the robolamb became
<br>
sophisticated enough to distinguish between wolves and
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p>We could think up cutesy brand names for our deadly
<br>
little mechanical sheep, such as... BLamb.  Or how about:
<br>
Do Ewe Feel Lucky?  Personally, I like:  Heeeeere Wolfy
<br>
Wolfy Wolfyyyy...
<br>
<p>Soon a subspecies of wolf would evolve which
<br>
has no appetite whatsoever for sheep or calves.  A good
<br>
GPS aboard the robolamb prevents the well-armed
<br>
beast from wandering off into town, giving and entirely new
<br>
meaning to that verse in Revelation 6 regarding people
<br>
fleeing the wrath of the lamb.
<br>
<p>No, dammit I havent been smoking anything!  spike
