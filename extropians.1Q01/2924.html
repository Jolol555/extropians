<p><em>&gt; This is an area that has long been debated.  Schools are being

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That would be extremely short sighted considering that no other skills
<br>
seem as tightly correlated with programming skills as math skills.  I
<br>
can see there isn't a lot of need any more to know how to do long
<br>
division with pencil and paper or extrapolate logs from printed tables. 
<br>
But understanding mathematical reasoning and algebraic manipulations and
<br>
concepts is crucial to really understanding much of anything in science
<br>
including understanding computer science and even computer languages.  
<br>
<p>But then school almost invariably taught math as a black box where you
<br>
plug problems into a formula that works for some unknown reason and
<br>
churn out answers.  Relatively rarely is enough to really understand
<br>
taught.  I suppose I should be surprised that they teach computers and
<br>
programming the same way.
<br>
<p>But damn if it doesn't tick me off!  It made me mad when I was in high
<br>
school. I watched people's minds getting shut down.  Needlessly.
<br>
<p>Maybe I will have to do some teaching.
