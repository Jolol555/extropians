Human psychology must be taken into account. A person designed as you 
<br>
suggest will be unable to live normally (perhaps at all) on earth. 
<br>
Engineered or not, born here or there, if they can't come back 
<br>
they're goin to come to resent earth and earth people--and that could 
<br>
be very dangerous. At the very least, it could cause them to destroy 
<br>
the project.
