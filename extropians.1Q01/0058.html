</em><br>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go nanotech!
</em><br>
<p>What about Pegasus and Conestoga programs (Orbital Sciences and who
<br>
else?)??
<br>
<p>Frankly, I don't buy it. Hudson got $30 million together, built a test
<br>
vehicle, but couldn't get $150 million? $150m is a shot in the bucket to
<br>
venture capitalists for projects of similar scope (on earth). From my
<br>
investigating, the Greens are spreading the word amongst the loyal to
<br>
fight these indie launch projects, with the logic that using Mojave,
<br>
Nevada, or other western desert launch sites exposes too many
<br>
communities to possible downrange debris in case of launch failure.
<br>
There was a big article this month in Earth Island magazine condemning
<br>
Kistler Aerospace's plans for its far more conventional launcher.
<br>
<p>I think what is happening is that NASA is telling Green sceientists that
<br>
love its &quot;Touchy, Feely, Caring&quot; 'mission to planet earth' environmental
<br>
observation program to drum up the troops against its free market
<br>
competition in the launch sector.
<br>
<p>Bankers hate controversy, and they hate hard hitting 'investigative
<br>
reporting' assasins impunging them when a company they finance comes
<br>
under the sights of some competition funded 'grassroots' campaign.
