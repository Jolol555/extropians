<p>Nothing. Pen knifes are considered weapons, as is pepper spray, tasers,
<br>
batons, etc. You have no right to defend yourself in Britain, and will
<br>
be prosecuted if you are successful in doing so. If you have any martial
<br>
arts training for which there is any documentation or if you admit to it
<br>
(video rental records might even be considered 'training' if you rent
<br>
kung fu movies) then your bare hands will be considered deadly weapons.
<br>
<p>As in the ancient chinese story, where the penalies for being late for
<br>
work and for revolt were both death, all this means is that you should
<br>
carry whatever you want, don't get caught, and don't report any
<br>
instances of defending yourself. Put your assailant down, get away from
<br>
the scene, destroy your weapons and all clothes you wore at the scene
<br>
(including shoes), change your haircut and shaving pattern, and buy
<br>
yourself an alibi from a trustworthy friend or two.
