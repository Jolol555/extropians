Despite the recent court decisions against Napster, free music file
<br>
sharing (and eventually software, images, film, and anything else that
<br>
can be digitized) will likely continue to grow, given the difficulty of
<br>
controlling de-centralized P2P systems like Gnutella and Freenet.
<br>
According to Dolfsma,  gross revenues for U.S. &quot;recordables&quot; in 1996
<br>
were about $12.3 billion.  See   ( How Will The Music Industry Weather

<br>
<p>Given this likely reality, it might be useful to consider another social
<br>
institution where people freely given money: tipping.    According to
<br>
this article, approximately $20 billion was spent on restaurant tips in
<br>
1998.  Why do people give so much money they don't have to?  How readily
<br>
will this behavior translate into the online world?
<br>
<p>The Tip: A Reward, But For Whom?
<br>
By William Grimes, THE NEW YORK TIMES SERVICE.
<br>
Dated: February 24, 1999.
<br>
<p><p>Many uncertainties surround the dining experience, but one thing is
<br>
sure. At the end of the meal, the diner, barring a near-nuclear
<br>
catastrophe, will leave a tip. Last year, North American diners left
<br>
an estimated $20-billion on the table. In the United States, the
<br>
average tip was 16.7 percent of the total bill. The Canadian
<br>
Restaurant and Foodservices Association does not keep a corresponding
<br>
figure, but Canadians are generally thought to tip slightly less, in
<br>
part because of higher food prices and sales taxes. In Manhattan, the
<br>
standard tip is closer to 20 percent at a good restaurant. Regardless
<br>
of the amount, the gesture may be mass delusion.
<br>
<p>In theory, a tip is a reward for good service. But many restaurants
<br>
pool tips - putting them into one pot and evenly dividing them at the
<br>
end of the night - which means that the reward intended for a
<br>
particular server is shared among many. Under these circumstances, a
<br>
tip is a little like a declaration of love delivered over a public
<br>
address system.
<br>
<p>And, in any case, the message may say more about the sender than the
<br>
receiver. A tip, social scientists seem to be discovering, has less to
<br>
do with the diner's opinion of the service than with his opinion of
<br>
himself, his need of approval or his desire to please the waiter. The
<br>
tip, in other words, is a puzzle. No one quite knows why diners tip in
<br>
the first place, or whether tipping serves any economic purpose.
<br>
<p>One economic argument for tipping is that it gives restaurants extra
<br>
managers at no cost. Because a restaurant cannot possibly monitor its
<br>
staff as efficiently and accurately as the people being served, this
<br>
function has been delegated to diners. Tipping also allows restaurants
<br>
to keep part of the cost of labour off the bill. &quot;It's a very
<br>
attractive way to support their labour force without having to pay
<br>
that cash up front,&quot; said Jayne Drennan, a faculty member in the food
<br>
and beverage management program of Toronto's George Brown School of
<br>
Hospitality and Tourism. The prospect of a good tip motivates the
<br>
staff to provide good service in the present, and the diner who leaves
<br>
a generous tip helps ensure good service in the future. But tipping is
<br>
not only, or even primarily, an economic transaction. It is also a
<br>
social event, and as researchers have discovered, a very complex one,
<br>
at times bordering on the perverse.
<br>
<p>Michael Lynn, an associate professor of consumer behaviour at the
<br>
Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, has been studying
<br>
tipping since 1980, and although he readily admits that many mysteries
<br>
remain, one thing is fairly clear: The quality of the service has very
<br>
little to do with the size of the tip. &quot;Bill size allows me to explain
<br>
70 per cent of the variability in tip amount,&quot; he said. &quot;Less than 2
<br>
percent of the variability can be explained by how the diner rates the
<br>
service.&quot; Lynn and others have found that the social norm of tipping
<br>
dictates that a more or less predictable tip will be left, depending
<br>
on the size of the bill. &quot;The primary motivation for tipping is social
<br>
approval,&quot; Lynn said &quot;It's expected.&quot;
<br>
<p>The peculiarities of the diner-server relationship also confound the
<br>
economic model. Researchers have found that, in most cases, diners do
<br>
not feel that they are judging the waiter, but that the waiter is
<br>
judging them. They tip to please. Theoretically, the tip is a weapon,
<br>
but as a social scientist named Leo Crespi found when he studied
<br>
tipping in the 1940s, &quot;most people do not have the requisite nerve.&quot;
<br>
This may be a North American problem. Some researchers have theorized
<br>
that the tip is a way to defuse anxiety associated with the unequal
<br>
server-diner relationship, and a way of fending off envy and ill
<br>
will. In a country dedicated to the principle of social equality, this
<br>
anxiety takes an acute form. Indeed, over the years, many social
<br>
critics have attacked tipping as an insult to our society's core
<br>
values, a repellent holdover from the days when aristocrats would
<br>
fling coins at their servants.
<br>
<p>In The Itching Palm, a 1916 creed against the practice, William
<br>
R. Scott argued that &quot;Tipping equals Flunkism, the author said, is
<br>
&quot;The willingness to be servile for a consideration,&quot; and he called it
<br>
&quot;democracy's deadliest foe.&quot; Social unease may be the waiter's friend,
<br>
however. In one well-known 1984 experiment, researchers found that a
<br>
waitress who touched her customers, whether male or female, on the
<br>
hand or shoulder when asking if the meal was all right, raised her
<br>
tips to 14 per cent, from 11 per cent. Sophisticated dinners may
<br>
cringe, but waiter introductions also put green on the table. So does
<br>
crouching at the table when taking an order or, if the server is a
<br>
women, putting a smiley face on the bill. For male waiters, the smiley
<br>
face cuts tips.
<br>
<p>Some responses are simply weird. It is well known that credit card
<br>
customers tip more lavishly than cash customers, but experiments have
<br>
shown that cash customers who are presented with a bill on a tray
<br>
embossed with credit card logos will leave more than those who receive
<br>
a plain tray. The waiter does not always win. It is well documented
<br>
that tip size decreases with the size of the party, which is why many
<br>
restaurants impose a mandatory service charge for groups of six or
<br>
more. According to the NPD Group, which does research on consumer
<br>
marketing, single dinners leave an average tip of 19.7 per cent. That
<br>
number drops to 16.9 per cent for two people, 15.2 per cent for three,
<br>
15.9 per cent for four and 13.2 per cent for five.
<br>
<p>Researchers have theorized that a phenomenon known as diffusion of
<br>
responsibility may account for the downward slide. Just as a lone
<br>
witness is more likely to help an accident victim than a witness who
<br>
is part of a group, the diner in a group may hold back a bit on the
<br>
tip, expecting others to pick up the slack. Or it may be that diners
<br>
feel that the amount of attention given to each member of the party
<br>
diminishes with the size of the group. Even if tips were a purely
<br>
economic message sent from diner to waiter, the widespread practice of
<br>
pooling tips jams the signal. In what is known as a &quot;pooled house,&quot;
<br>
which includes almost all fine-dining restaurants in New York and many
<br>
in such cities as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, a tip does not
<br>
usually go directly into the pocket of the waiter.
<br>
<p>Instead, all cash and credit-card tips are added up at the end of the
<br>
evening and distributed to waiters, runners and busboys according to a
<br>
point system. A point is the total tip pool divided by the total hours
<br>
worked by the pool participants. Each worker receives an amount equal
<br>
to hours worked multiplied by the point amount, or the fraction of a
<br>
point assigned to a particular job category. In a nonpooled house,
<br>
seating can become a serious source of friction, and service can
<br>
become balkanized, with waiters at one station refusing to help
<br>
customers outside their area. In theory, workers in a pooled house
<br>
will be eager to help each other.
<br>
<p>&quot;I like the pool system better,&quot; said Belinda Behne, who has been a
<br>
waitress at Gotham Bar and Grill for five years. &quot;I realize that the
<br>
old maverick style of waiter doesn't like it, but the pool means that
<br>
no one waiter gets hurt, and you can rely on a steady income.&quot;
