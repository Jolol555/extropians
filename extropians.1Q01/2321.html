<p>My fears are the following:
<br>
&nbsp;- That CPRM might actually be a very well designed technology. If it was
<br>
just a software layer over the operating system, sure, I can break it. But
<br>
if it's integrated in the computer itself, there's no way I can defeat it on
<br>
a budget.
<br>
&nbsp;- That the masses will be indifferent enough not to mind if they buy a hard
<br>
disk and there's this weird &quot;CPRM&quot; thing mentioned in the fine print.
<br>
<p>Suddenly, there will be *no* alternatives. And while we were looking away,
<br>
the scenery for content extortion has been set up.
<br>
<p>There is this film called The Matrix, I'm sure some of you might have heard
<br>
of it [grin]. There's this Keanu Reeves that plays some bloke named Neo in
<br>
this film, and Keanu gets USD 30 million to do it. But that might still be
<br>
OK; I don't mind that.
<br>
<p>Oh, but I forgot. There is also this producer who earns hundreds of millions
<br>
from the movie. Oh, and they produce hundreds of movies to earn hundreds of
<br>
millions from. But I could tolerate that, too.
<br>
<p>What I *don't* particularly like is that these people don't realize that
<br>
they are already in an outrageously advantegous position, and now they even
<br>
want to *increase* their advantage. If this succeeds, I think it may lead to
<br>
a totalitarian regime (diguised as a democracy) with content-generators as
<br>
the new powers that be.
<br>
<p>&quot;Ave Imperator Case, morituri te salutant!&quot;
