Hi. It *seems* to be an undecided matter at this time--subject to the 
<br>
latest court decisions, of course. Found this in a book of mine 
<br>
(forgive any typos):
<br>
<p>&quot;Some website owners object to the use of deep links. They want all 
<br>
the people who use their website to go first to the home page, 
<br>
usually because advertising is posted there. The use of deep links 
<br>
can cost such a website advertising revenue. In the first case of its 
<br>
kind, Ticketmaster Online sued Microsoft because it linked from its 
<br>
Sidewalk city guides to pages deep within Ticketmaster's website. The 
<br>
case was settled, and as a result there have been no court rulings to 
<br>
date on whether deep linking constitutes copyright infringement or 
<br>
violates other intellectual property laws, such as trademark laws.
<br>
<p>&quot;Many copyright experts believe that deep linking is not copyright 
<br>
infringement--after all, the author of a novel can't prevent readers 
<br>
from reading the end first if they so desire, so why should a website 
<br>
owner have the right to determine in what order a user can access a 
<br>
website? Nevertheless, it's prudent to be careful before deep linking 
<br>
to advertising-rich commercial sites. Many such sites have linking 
<br>
policies posted. Some well-known websites such as amazon.com welcome 
<br>
deep links. If a comemrcial website has no posting [sic] linking 
<br>
policy or says that deep links are not allowed, it's wise to ask for 
<br>
permission before deep linking. Otherwiseyou could wind up getting a 
<br>
&quot;cease and desist&quot; letter from a lawyer.&quot;
<br>
<p>This from The Copyright Handbook, by Stephen Fishman (atty who also 
<br>
writes and edits ref works for attys), Nolo Press, v5 (February 
<br>
2000). If you really want to get into it, you'll need to hit a law 
<br>
library and follow current caselaw.
<br>
<p>Whether that cease &amp; desist letter will carry any weight is another 
<br>
matter--it may if the courts come down on the no-links side at a 
<br>
later date. You might respond to them that your understanding based 
<br>
on current law is that it's legal--notify you with statute/caselaw 
<br>
cites if this changes (putting the burden to follow changing law on 
<br>
them.) this will not make you any friends there, of course.
<br>
<p>I would certainly think that a deep link which did not merely take 
<br>
the viewer to the linked site, but did so while keeping him within 
<br>
the linker's frame containing advertising--would be far more likely 
<br>
to be frowned upon by a court than a straight deep link w/no frame--
<br>
particularly if the linked site contains advertising which may be 
<br>
rendered nonvisible, bypassed, or reduced in size as a result.
<br>
<p>At the moment, it *appears* to be safe to deep link. As always, the 
<br>
law blunders along behind the tech.
<br>
<p>Hope this is helpful.
<br>
Thanks for providing this forum--and so much more.

<p>&gt; Does anyone know what the law says about &quot;deep linking&quot;. Say you write some 
&gt; comments on an article appearing on a magazine's Web page, and you link 
&gt; directly to the article. (The article appears in a new browser, exactly as 
&gt; it would appear if the viewer had gone there directly.)
&gt; 
&gt; What if the magazine sent you a Cease and Desist letter, and told you that 
&gt; it did not permitting linking to its content (which is freely open to the 
&gt; public), only to its main page?
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds ridiculous to me. The magazine would be turning away freely 
&gt; given traffic that it would otherwise not receive. What I'm really 
&gt; interested in is not so much the silliness of such a policy, but whether an 
&gt; online magazine can legally enforce such a claim. I would think the law 
&gt; does *not* support this, but sometimes &quot;the law is an ass&quot;, so I'm asking 
&gt; the many-brained List if it knows the law in this area.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't imagine telling someone, &quot;No, no, I don't permit you to link to The 
&gt; Extropian Principles. You may only link to my home page.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
