Solution: full disclosure? &quot;Officer, for quality purposes, I am
<br>
recording this conversation. No, I can't turn it off, it doesn't work
<br>
like that, sorry; the system is designed to roll non stop whenever my
<br>
car is not parked in my garage. I wish I could help you. I need to be
<br>
going now.&quot;
<br>
<p>As far as video recording (not audio) goes, the courts appear to have
<br>
mostly ruled using the notion of &quot;a reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;.
<br>
One court at least ruled that a woman trapped in a car begging to be
<br>
killed to put her out of her misery later had no recourse against
<br>
ride-along media recording and broadcasting not merely her image, but
<br>
her voice as well.
<br>
<p>Strange days, indeed.
