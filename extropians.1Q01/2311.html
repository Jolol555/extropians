</em><br>
<p>I think there are two broad categories of &quot;dirty tricks&quot;.  There are
<br>
ones that actually infringe on the rights of others such as resorting to
<br>
fraud, sabotage and physical force.  These are criminal and it is the
<br>
job of the police and courts (or their private equivalents) to identify
<br>
and punish such actions.  Then there are others that may offend our
<br>
sense of fairness but are not actual violations of rights.  These
<br>
others, in theory, are self-limiting in their abuses.  Exclusionary
<br>
deals have a way of being difficult to enforce over time, although they
<br>
are easier to set up and keep going than price collusion.  
<br>
<p>The best product for the price with the best surrounding context will
<br>
win over time.  This does not mean that at any particular time
<br>
everything is fair or looks precisely like some idealized competition
<br>
model.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do other entrepreneurs think?  Is fair competition a nice, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improbable ideal?  Should a business model include cut-throat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quasi-legal activities just to stay competitive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It depends on what you have in mind.  Industrial espionage is a bit
<br>
gray.  What does and does not qualify?  Is hiring some ex-employees of
<br>
your competitor industrial espionage?  Actual spying within their plant
<br>
is a physical trespass and should be prosecuted as such.  It has no
<br>
place in legit business.  Court actions over patents?  Depends.  In
<br>
today's climate you might not have a lot of choice.  But this says
<br>
something more about today's climate than about business in general I
<br>
think.
