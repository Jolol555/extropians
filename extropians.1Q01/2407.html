<a href="http://www.opera.com">http://www.opera.com</a> ? It and Netscape 4.75 makes the wait for

usable (1.0?) Mozilla bearable, and trains people not do design

web site which can only be used with a specific browser.

<p><em>&gt; broke the syntax rules of HTML in previous versions, they have since

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Style Sheets.  They released IE for the Mac later than the PC, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this latest version is currently rated as the most CSS-compliant
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Trouble is, the web is broken, and broken beyond repair. I'm really
<br>
looking forward to p2p web successors, and whether we'll get a new
<br>
open standard simultaneously addressing the balkanization and the
<br>
technical deficiencies issues in a sustainable way.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, Netscape has released a larger, bloated version which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually degrades its function.  Since being bought out by AOL, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been more focused on merging AOL functionality into the browser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than implementing actual Internet standards.  Microsoft IE is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now a superior product over Netscape due to superior quality.
</em><br>
<p>Netscape 6 is dead as a doornail, absolutely.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; My earlier post mentioned MS' dirty tricks of serving jagged fonts to

</em><br>
<p>Here's one instance as to why the web is broken: it renders documents
<br>
for the user's retina, but it deliberately, stupidly did not specify
<br>
how exactly the document is rendered, making it rely on existing context.
<br>
<p>Instead of specifying embedded cacheable fonts (font ID made from
<br>
the cryptographic hash of the font data) and a mechanism by which 
<br>
they're typeset.
<br>
<p>You have to keep the context essentially at zero, and define higher
<br>
order functionality in terms of existing primitives. A language,
<br>
in other words. Since it can be made to run in a sandbox, it needs
<br>
not be unsafe. And don't get me started on http, oh my.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; serving error messages instead of content to Netscape.  That was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given as a history lesson.  None of Microsoft's current products are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known to play these tricks any more.  Although many old-timers have a
</em><br>
<p>Even MS does not that it can't afford playing it's usual heavy-handed
<br>
tricks if it's under heavy flak fire from all parts of horizont.
<br>
I really wish it'd sink, and only to liberate the human resources for
<br>
the job market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; long memory, the market is quick and dynamic.  The market
</em><br>
<p>I personally make a statement to boykott vendors who're malicious
<br>
and/or stupid. Concerted action can cumulate, provided well-informed
<br>
customers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; re-evaluates things currently in view.  Microsoft products are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer defacto, and are actually fighting on their merits.  Macintosh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is making a comeback.  Unix, especially AIX and Linux are becoming
</em><br>
<p>I could say several nasty things about Cupertino here, but I won't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; bigger all the time.  And Microsoft's defacto windows client base has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fragmented into window 95/98, windows NT, windows 2000, windows ME,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, they tried to cash in multiple times on essentially the same
<br>
products. Time to taste how balkanization tastes if it concerns
<br>
your own line of products on your very own market.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Although Microsoft may have gotten its start with a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quasi-legal maneuvering and dirty tricks, these methods don't work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever. If Microsoft is going to survive, it will do so based on
</em><br>
<p>Which partially restores my faith into humanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; actual product quality.  Windows was a kludge of smoke and mirrors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over DOS.  Windows 95 was actually a major product development of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shell over DOS.  Windows NT was actually a carefully designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating system.  Windows 2000 is an attempt to migrate their client
</em><br>
<p>Strictly speaking, NT was not a purely Microsoft product. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; base from the kludge to the real OS.  In the future, they will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce even more quality products.  Their quick-and-dirty tricks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be a thing of the past.
</em><br>
<p>I would love to see Microsoft to reinvent itself. It would prove that it
<br>
can be done.
