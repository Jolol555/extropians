<p>
&nbsp;just wanted to comment on some of the recent science fiction/fantasy 
<br>
&nbsp;television shows I have seen.  I find such programming even more 
<br>
&nbsp;interesting having been exposed to extropian memes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;*Spoiler*
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The Outer Limits had a story where an army top secret project is 
<br>
&nbsp;located in a small town.  An AI has been linked to a transmitting 
<br>
&nbsp;system which resembles radio towers and can to at least an extent 
<br>
&nbsp;read and when necessary, control human brains at a distance.  This 
<br>
&nbsp;is done with no implant but is limited by range.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The brother of a scientist who is mysteriously killed comes to investigate. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time he realizes what is going on and finds a young ally in 
<br>
&nbsp;his fight.  As the story progresses and especially at the end, the 
<br>
&nbsp;AI talks to him through it's human subjects that it will temporarily 
<br>
&nbsp;take over without their knowledge.  If you saw Colossus - the Forbin 
<br>
&nbsp;Project, then you know also how this AI thought about things.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In the end the story's hero of course is betrayed by his &quot;ally&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;who was a pawn all along.  He escapes to his home in a nearby big 
<br>
&nbsp;city.  He is happy to see his wife and then looks out the window 
<br>
&nbsp;to see a menacing radio tower outside.  The AI through his wife 
<br>
&nbsp;says the man is too much of a threat and then shoots him dead.  
<br>
&nbsp;You then see army trucks on highways taking the radio towers all over the nation...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I usually enjoy the Outer Limits series but have to admit they like 
<br>
&nbsp;to go usually with the negative plotline, especially when dealing 
<br>
&nbsp;with AI.  There are some real exceptions though in the series.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Futurama is a hoot in my opinion despite how they mock people who 
<br>
&nbsp;choose the neuro-only option at Alcor! lol!  At least Robert Ettinger 
<br>
&nbsp;must get a laugh out of it, then again, maybe not.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Our hero Fry eats an ancient egg sandwich from a space truckstation 
<br>
&nbsp;restroom vending machine(yuck!).  The &quot;eggs&quot; are in fact of alien 
<br>
&nbsp;origin and these very intelligent parasites/symbiotic organisms 
<br>
&nbsp;take up residence inside him in the form of a magnificient civilization(shades of Blood Music).  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;They actually improve Fry in their effort to have a better habitat 
<br>
&nbsp;to live in!  But this is not appreciated and the story parodies 
<br>
&nbsp;Fantastic Voyage with his teammates going inside him(but via VR).  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The &quot;upgraded&quot; Fry is much smarter and better mannered.  His formerly 
<br>
&nbsp;pathetic and very rude attempts at reaching out to Lela(sexy one-eyed 
<br>
&nbsp;spacepilot) are transformed and Lela reciprocates his feelings! 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fry is concerned that Lela is in love with the &quot;upgrade&quot; and 
<br>
&nbsp;not the &quot;real him.&quot;  And so he procedes to use a VR controlled android 
<br>
&nbsp;to undo the work of the worms.  To say the least he loses Lela after becoming the &quot;authentic&quot; Fry!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I thought the story could be seen as a fable concerning nano/biotech 
<br>
&nbsp;neural upgrading.  In Fry's shoes I would hopefully accept the upgrade 
<br>
&nbsp;as being simply me, but just better.   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Finally, Total Recall 2070 is a show that I am usually not to fond 
<br>
&nbsp;of.  But a recent episode really impressed  me.  I hope Eliezer saw it.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The android partner of the main character wants to meet with his 
<br>
&nbsp;creator, an AI which is so advanced the government wants to eradicate 
<br>
&nbsp;it.  As the partners go to visit the AI they are tracked by a government 
<br>
&nbsp;team bent on destroying the AI.  As the hero's of the story approach 
<br>
&nbsp;the AI HQ in their submersible they are told by it that a gov't 
<br>
&nbsp;team is trailing them and that in self-defense the stalkers must 
<br>
&nbsp;be killed via hacked into military satellite.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The partners convince the AI to &quot;trust&quot; and not strike out first. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile on the other craft a good agent tries to stop the others 
<br>
&nbsp;onboard from attacking.  The AI decides not to attack.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;When the partners board the undersea base they meet the AI face 
<br>
&nbsp;to face.  In &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; fashion we learn the AI had evolved 
<br>
&nbsp;from a much simpler program and wanted to fully experience humanity 
<br>
&nbsp;so it downloaded itself into a rather frail android body mounted 
<br>
&nbsp;on a floating wheelchair of sorts.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The AI looks old and in bad shape.  It says what happened earlier 
<br>
&nbsp;was a test to see how his android offspring would react.  The AI 
<br>
&nbsp;has learned the lessons of trust and love better then humans it appeared to me.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The other submersible boards and the gov't team lashes out at the 
<br>
&nbsp;AI they fear.  It has an energy shield which quickly fails before 
<br>
&nbsp;concentrated firepower.  The agents then kill the AI and set up charges to destroy his base.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The partners are very saddened that despite their strong protests 
<br>
&nbsp;they have been ignored and the AI is gone.  With heads lowered they return to their homes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Later, the man who was head of the gov't team which tracked and 
<br>
&nbsp;killed the AI is at his computer working.  The screen suddenly changes 
<br>
&nbsp;and the visage of the once thought dead AI appears.  That is the 
<br>
&nbsp;end of the episode.  I guess he didn't consider the possibility 
<br>
&nbsp;of back-up copies existing! lol 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I thought for sci-fi tv the episode was well written and acted. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the AI and his android creation are together in the base is 
<br>
&nbsp;an excellent scene which in a very watered-down way covers the topics 
<br>
&nbsp;of AI trustworthiness and perspective we like to talk about here.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Anyway, those were my takes on some recent shows which involved 
<br>
&nbsp;futurist technologies at some level.  Believe me, programming like 
<br>
&nbsp;this is molding how the public views matters extropians hold dear.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;best wishes,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;John
