A little something wriiten by James P. Hogan--writer, engineer, etc. which
<br>
may (or may not) be of interest:
<br>
<p>&quot;How do you get the logic across to some people that showing the butler
<br>
didn't do it doesn't prove that the chauffeur must have? ...In earlier
<br>
postings (see below and in the BB Archives), and also the essay &quot;Evolution
<br>
Revisited,&quot; contained in the fiction/nonfiction collection Rockets, Redheads, &amp;
<br>
Revolution, [link to Title Page] I've expressed reservations that the confidence
<br>
I've displayed in accepting and promoting Neo-Darwinism in years gone by
<br>
may have been misplaced. Today, it comes across as being as much the result of
<br>
dogma rather than hard evidence as the biblical fundamentalism that many of
<br>
its advocates militantly oppose. Some people conclude that therefore I must
<br>
be a Creationist....  It's an example of false dichotomy - and one that the
<br>
media and much of the world in general perceives in connection with this
<br>
topic. 
<br>
<p>Some authorities define &quot;science&quot; as the seeking and study of
<br>
materialistic, naturalistic explanations of everything. But suppose the fact is that
<br>
some things don't have materialistic, naturalistic explanations. It seems to me
<br>
that if that were the case, such narrowness could end up excluding from
<br>
&quot;science&quot; some of the most important questions confronting us. A better measure
<br>
of &quot;scientific&quot; in my view would be objectivity, i.e. forgetting
<br>
preconceptions and emotional investment in what one would like the answers to be, and
<br>
being willing to follow wherever the evidence seems to point. And if, as a
<br>
lot of hard-nosed, working scientists, not just those with religious
<br>
persuasions, are coming out in the open and saying, the sheer complexity and other
<br>
irresolvables of the things being uncovered in biological cell machinery and
<br>
elsewhere lead to the suspicion that &quot;This was designed by
<br>
somebody/something, for a purpose; it didn't just happen by itself,&quot; then so be it as far as
<br>
I'm concerned. Whatever the truth of the matter is, it isn't going to be
<br>
affected by anything I choose to believe, or how many people agree with me.&quot;

<br>
<p>Being a creationist is pretty dumb, true. However, &quot;directed evolution&quot; at
<br>
least sounds plausible, and merrits some attention. Further, the idea that
<br>
it's not all evolution, that something else important might be going on
<br>
which we can't see yet, that merrits attention too.
<br>
<p>I think it's a worthwhile thread. We assume natural selection most of the
<br>
time; it's good to try defending it/breaking it down every now and again.
