<em>&gt; I don't know the answer, but what I do know is that ants within a colony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all very closely related, all children of the same Queen.  They may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even be clones.  From this perspective the ants are in some ways more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the cells in your body than like individual organisms.
</em><br>
<p>The reason I'm asking about ant colonies is because an ant colony is a
<br>
single reproductive entity which nonetheless contains independently viable
<br>
and mobile subcomponents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You might ask whether selfishness and competition plays a role in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our bodies.
</em><br>
<p>An equally valid question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One example I can think of is sperm cells, which compete to see which can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get into the egg first.
</em><br>
<p>Sperm compete with other males' sperm.  I don't think there's any
<br>
correlation between the fitness of a particular sperm and the particular
<br>
chromosome set a sperm contains, so it's hard to see how competion could
<br>
occur or how artificial competition could be adaptive for the male. 
<br>
(Though the *female's* genes have an interest in combining only with
<br>
healthy sperm.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There may also be some competitive structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the immune system, where cells which create antibodies which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful in identifying pathogens get rewarded.  I don't know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details though.  There are also theories of &quot;neural darwinism&quot; where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain cells compete in some sense during the early months and years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain formation.
</em><br>
<p>I've heard of &quot;hedonist neuron&quot; theories of brain development, but you're
<br>
right, the use of controlled evolution in the immune system is also a case
<br>
in point.
<br>
<p>(Personal nitpick with accepted terminology:  &quot;Neural darwinism&quot; is a
<br>
lousy term, since it implies transmission of differential characteristics
<br>
to offspring.  This is not darwinism; it is survival of the fittest.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking of the sperm example, I've also read that bees use competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to decide which get to reproduce, in much the same way.  The queen bee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flies as high as possible and only the strongest males can fly up to it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and mate.  I don't know whether ants use a similar selection mechanism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it would make sense if they do.
</em><br>
<p>This is competition between reproductive entities, and thus not really a
<br>
case in point.
