<p><em>&gt;I think the point of Eliezer's puzzle was to challenge our assumptions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;force us to think outside the box ('box' probably being another clue). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;box this time being the *form* of the riddle-answer pair.
</em><br>
<p>Look, let's just work through this.
<br>
<p>I am two boxes, each inside the other;
<br>
I am myself, I have no brother;
<br>
I am exactly what I claim;
<br>
If you guess this riddle, speak my name.
<br>
<p>The reason the quote from my book referred to [indexical or deictic]
<br>
shifters is because I now take it for granted that the sentences above are
<br>
saying (falsely):
<br>
<p>As A = A, I = I. I am I, the self in the world and the self inside the
<br>
skin. When I use the term `I' in any declaration, that `I' points
<br>
reflexively back to the utterer. The name the quatrain wishes us to speak
<br>
is `I': if Eliezer proposes it as a challenge, as he did in the first
<br>
instance, another person would be justified in answering `Eliezer' to the
<br>
riddle, I should think. 
<br>
<p>To explain why this claim is false would entail a long diatribe on the
<br>
multi-part subject construction of the allegedly unitary or sovereign
<br>
classic `self', a topic exhaustively examined in the last 30 years of
<br>
deconstruction--and, of course, in `society of mind' models in cognitive
<br>
science, and psychoanalysis, and Popper, etc.
<br>
<p>It might be that these remarks will still be seen by Eliezer and Dale as
<br>
missing *their* point, in which case I invite further elucidation from them.
