<p>Well, yes, but that's almost a trivial implication of drextech general
<br>
assemblers or even advanced earlier models. FWIW, what I was raising in THE
<br>
SPIKE was the notion (adapted from Theobald and his colleagues) that *right
<br>
now* in the technologically advanced world, a GI tax floor makes sense (1)
<br>
as a way of neatening up a whole barrage of social security safety nets
<br>
that often don't work or are counter-productive, and (2) getting people at
<br>
the margins of the human work economy used to the idea of living this way. 
<br>
<p>It would take a rich First World economy to permit this allocation of
<br>
resources prior to drextech; I can't see how it would work in India *until*
<br>
assemblers arrive, at which point maybe the economy changes *so* radically
<br>
there's little point talking about strategies and tactics just now. (And
<br>
maybe the species changes fast as well, although given the slow speed with
<br>
which humans grow to maturity I suppose that's not such an issue; the
<br>
emergence of AIs and SIs will be, of course, if it happens.)
<br>
<p>Caution: this is *not* meant as a recipe for people lying in the gutter
<br>
with needles in their arms watching porno on government-provided street
<br>
corner TV screens and eating subsidized McChow. It could turn out that way,
<br>
or worse, but I think that dystopic forecast needs to be argued rather than
<br>
bleakly assumed.
