Vandals behind spread of Hybris worm named
<br>

<br>
<p>Vandals behind the spread of an irritating and potentially dangerous 
<br>
virus have being tracked down to Brazil.
<br>
<p>For weeks users, including us here at The Register, have received 
<br>
numerous emails from <a href="mailto:hahaha@sexyfun.net?Subject=Re:%20[exi-freedom]%20Virus%20warning...&In-Reply-To=&lt;p05010400b69ff9f1d737@[207.36.25.219]&gt;">hahaha@sexyfun.net</a> with attachments that appear 
<br>
to be Snow White-related porn but which actually contain the Hybris 
<br>
worm.
<br>
<p>Hybris is an Internet worm that spreads itself as an attachment to 
<br>
email messages, and affects only Windows systems. The worm contains 
<br>
components (plug-ins) in its code that are executed depending on what 
<br>
worm needs, and these components can be upgraded from a Web site. The 
<br>
worm has polymorphic attributes, which means that it can appear in a 
<br>
variety of forms, and its behaviour is determined on the set of 
<br>
installed components.
<br>
<p>When run, the worm infects WSOCK32.DLL. Whenever an email is sent, 
<br>
the worm attempts to send a copy of itself as an attachment to a 
<br>
separate message to the same recipient. This means that the virus is 
<br>
being spread by infected users to people they know, not via a spam 
<br>
campaign. The address the virus appears to come from is a fake - 
<br>
which has made identifying the people ultimately responsible for its 
<br>
spread more difficult.
<br>
<p>However, security firm Aladdin Knowledge Systems said that its 
<br>
Content Security Response Team (CSRT) has tracked down the people 
<br>
responsible for launching the attack, which it identifies as a 
<br>
Brazilian group called VX-BRAZIL. The group is well known in 
<br>
anti-virus circles and its members include Alevirus, Delta, 
<br>
Kamaileon, NBK, Eu and Vecna, whose name actually appears inside the 
<br>
malicious code itself.
<br>
<p>MessageLabs, a UK-based firm which filters users' email for malicious 
<br>
code, said that it had intercepted more than 2000 copies of Hybris, 
<br>
all of which came from hahaha@sexyfun.net. The virus can also be 
<br>
identified because one of four subjects is likely to be listed. These 
<br>
are: Snowhite and the Seven Dwarfs - The REAL story!; Branca de Neve 
<br>
porne!; Les 7 coquir nains; and Enanito si, pero con que pedazo!
<br>
<p>The attached file within the email will likely have one of 16 names. 
<br>
The most common include 'midgets.scr', 'dwarf4you.exe' and 
<br>
'blancheneige.exe' However, variants of the infected email may 
<br>
include a host of other subjects and attached file names.
<br>
<p>As well as having an up-to-date virus scanner, users can also help to 
<br>
curtail the spread of the virus, should they be able to identify the 
<br>
source of these emails sent to them, by warning people they are 
<br>
infected. As always users are advised not to open attachments they 
<br>
are not sure about and to delete any suspicious email as a matter of 
<br>
course. ®
