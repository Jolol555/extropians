</em><br>
<p><p>Quite so.  Before this, if you were convicted of a crime it was &quot;cake or 
<br>
death&quot; --  no middle ground.  However, an effective middle ground was 
<br>
created with the increasing application of &quot;clergyable&quot; offenses, mostly 
<br>
with regard to who could invoke that privilege.  Obviously this is a poor 
<br>
stopgap though.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Misleading rot. The government in 1922 was *handing out* guns to combat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vets because they were afraid of a revolution. Licensing of firearms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at that time was used for political purposes, to prevent opponents of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the state (read: communists) getting their hands on them. The current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system of handgun control came into force mostly after WW2 ...
</em><br>
<p><p>You are saying exactly what I did, just differently.  Real gun control did 
<br>
not kick in until the second half of the 20th century, nor did the serious 
<br>
increases in violence.
<br>
<p>Political licensing of firearms is *exactly* what many Americans fear about 
<br>
gun registration.  When people give the government an axe, they never 
<br>
expect it to be swung at *their* heads.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't want to get into a debate over this, but violent crime dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sharply after the English started going out armed as a matter of habit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; during the first half of the 19th century in response to the high crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bollocks to that. Violent crime dropped sharply with the introduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of modern policing, the disarmament of the nobility, and the evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a modern judicial and penal system.
</em><br>
<p><p>The murder rate at the end of the 20th century, when everyone has been 
<br>
disarmed, is something like 50% higher than the murder rate at the end of 
<br>
the 19th century, when people were armed to the teeth.  While this does not 
<br>
prove causality (anecdotal), it does disprove the inverse (i.e. fewer arms 
<br>
=&gt; less violence).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You've got a *very* weird view of English history. I don't want to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dragged into a long thread on this, but if you want I have a friend who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has recently finished a PhD in the history of English policing during
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the period in question -- I can put you in touch with him if you want.
</em><br>
<p><p>My English history is by no means thorough.  Try as I might, there are only 
<br>
so many hours in the day. :^)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Clue: the arguments I'm putting are his, not mine. Lest this sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like an appeal to authority, I'd like to point out that I do _not_ have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a PhD in the history of the development of the English police forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from 1820-1850. However, Chris's discussion of that period sounds a hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a lot more plausible than yours (and he's happy to argue footnotes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and primary sources).
</em><br>
<p><p>This isn't inconsistent with what I am stating, and I have some familiarity 
<br>
with the topic, though I am no authority myself (though I believe David 
<br>
Friedman and others have written papers on this very topic IIRC).  The 
<br>
development of English police forces was in response to perceived failures 
<br>
of existing systems in the early 19th century.  However, the creation of 
<br>
modern law enforcement in England itself created problems that hadn't 
<br>
existed prior to its creation.  In many ways, early 19th century justice 
<br>
systems had many excellent qualities that are lacking today.  One could 
<br>
argue that the best solution would have been to make minor tweaks to the 
<br>
existing mechanisms of justice (most of the problems were matters of 
<br>
convention and tradition rather than fundamental structural flaws as far as 
<br>
I can tell), rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater as has 
<br>
effectively happened.  Unfortunately, it seems that something similar has 
<br>
happened in the U.S., although the historical context is a little different.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
