<p>I'm not sure in what context you wanted to make that point, but generally
<br>
selfishness by itself isn't very efficient. It's only efficient when
<br>
combined with reasonably competitive markets (not to mention other
<br>
capitalist institutions like property rights and enforceable contracts). 
<br>
But for markets to exist you need agents who can plan and negotiate with
<br>
each other and so on. It's hard to see how an ant colony can take
<br>
advantage of &quot;capitalistic algorithms&quot; when it doesn't have the necessary
<br>
hardware to run them.
<br>
<p>To make the question more interesting you have to ask: if ants were
<br>
intelligent, would individual ants exhibit selfish behavior? I would guess
<br>
no. Even with selfish participants, command economies (like those within
<br>
corporations) can get fairly large before they become inefficient and have
<br>
to resort to markets. Probably in an organization as small as an ant
<br>
colony, and without the constraint of selfishness, having markets would
<br>
not increase efficiency. Without markets, it's hard to see what purpose
<br>
selfishness could serve.
