<p>How do you know?
<br>
You've never accumulated a thousand years of experience.
<br>
<p>You live among humans who grow old, their bodies decaying, their minds
<br>
slowly running out of neurons, and you see some of them - though not all
<br>
of them - growing weary, jaded, tired, bored, tired of life, and from this
<br>
you make the leap to minds in general?
<br>
<p>An enterprise like the Clock of the Long Now doesn't sound to me like the
<br>
product of a weary and suicidal mind.  You believe that the future is
<br>
worth gifting but you don't think it's interesting enough to be worth
<br>
seeing for yourself?  No change, no novelty, nothing worth the effort - is
<br>
that really taking the long view?  Is that really the message that you
<br>
intend the Clock of the Long Now to convey?
<br>
<p>Change is what defines time, and the long view isn't just about looking
<br>
past time, it's about looking past change.  And the message of the Clock
<br>
of the Long Now isn't just that it continues to tick; the message of the
<br>
Clock of the Long Now is that somebody back in the third millennium cared
<br>
enough about the future to send the Clock to you - even though the world
<br>
you inhabit is different from theirs, and they knew it would be, when they
<br>
built the Clock.
<br>
<p>If all you want from the Clock is changelessness, then don't bother with
<br>
the act of creation.  Just step outside and look at the night sky.
<br>
<p>But if not, you might want to consider the idea that there are things in
<br>
the future that are new.  That, even after a thousand years, there will
<br>
still be things in the thousand-and-tenth year that you haven't seen. 
<br>
That maybe the ennui that comes with old age is only the way things are
<br>
*now*, *here*; that maybe there is a better way.  That there's the
<br>
possibility, not just of change, but change for the better.  And that
<br>
that's what makes the future worth gifting to.
<br>
