<em>&gt; In many cultures (the Masai, ancient Celtic, ancient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; India) cattle theft was regarded as a perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honorable activity. One who could not keep his cattle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not deserve to do so. Rob Roy MacGregor was famous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for being a great 'riever and retriever' - a cattle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thief and one who could pursue and retrieve cattle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stolen from him.
</em><br>
<p>Oh! And yet one more example regarding homicide!
<br>
<p>Most of us know this, but didn't remember. People in India thought it proper
<br>
to burn all the man's widows - alive - once the man passed away. Word has it
<br>
that a wealthy man could leave behind 40 or 50 widows, many of them pretty
<br>
young... Imagine the massacre.
<br>
<p>I don't know what the widows in question thought about their being burned
<br>
alive, though. Does anyone know more about this phenomenon? Specifically,
<br>
what was the attitude of the women going to be burned to the fact that they
<br>
were going to be burned? Was their cooperation voluntary or was there
<br>
significant resistance?
<br>
<p>[I'm not joking - it might just be that it was, due to the peculiar social
<br>
organization, practically impossible for a woman to sustain herself after
<br>
her man died. Hence the burning. But I don't know for sure.]
