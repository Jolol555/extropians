<em>&gt; Terry:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;They also speak about the &quot;wisdom&quot; of nature
</em><br>
<p>Damien:
<br>
<em>&gt;(Nature) =  Run time + computational space.
</em><br>
<p>snip(criticism of the ability/adequacy of humans to sufficiently model their
<br>
world in order to predict the outcomes of potential actions.)
<br>
<p>snip(advice to intervening, manipulating humans to heed the 'wisdom of
<br>
nature' as man takes over the tiller.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I was trying to explicate what it *is* about`nature' that distinguishes its
</em><br>
processes and products from human `designed culture'.
<br>
<p>I think that you are looking for something that doesn't exist on the meta
<br>
level. Humanity as a subset of nature is learning the ropes of directed
<br>
evolution. Attempts to improve upon natural-selection-after-the-fact by
<br>
incorporating man's simulation/mimc capabilities will, hopefully, minimize
<br>
or reduce the number of unsuccessful (resource-depleting) 'adaptive'
<br>
attempts. The compression in TAT (turn-around-time) from implementation
<br>
until outcome will result in more drastic risk-reward gradients.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...it often makes a lot of sense to give priority to the former (nature)
</em><br>
<p>snip(nature has a proven track record running the entire earth ecosystem.
<br>
man has only a few paltry simulations.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...I'm asserting that some such implicit analysis underlies
</em><br>
many people's preference for `nature' over `human constructions', ..
<br>
(however) most people are only too eager to intervene in the world without
<br>
having a clue what they're doing...
<br>
<p>the dichotomous impact/influence of time? Nature's relative time frame
<br>
seeming rather slow and plodding. Therefore the result of natural selection
<br>
has little averaged relevance to any singular being. However, when the time
<br>
lapse
<br>
between cause-and-effect is dramatically compressed, the impact on the
<br>
individual (whose lifespan is limited) is considerable.
<br>
<p>and then there is that all-important bugaboo: Responsibility. Nature-caused
<br>
disasters are the result of unavoidable fate. Man-caused disasters are
<br>
'obviously' due to failure on the part of the organism or out-and-out evil
<br>
intentionality.
<br>
<p>I don't know. Try to use game theory to forecast the alternate payoffs.
<br>
Would you rather go head-to-head in a PD matrix with nature or humanity?
<br>
Wouldn't you prefer an antagonist that utilizes memory?
