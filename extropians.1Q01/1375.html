<p>
This list is having more problems with the g~u~n argument.  The 
<br>
problem is not really with the topic itself, but with the discussion 
<br>
about about the discussion.  This meta-discussion about whether the 
<br>
discussion should even take place is definitely a change of subject 
<br>
and not represented by whatever subject line is already in use.
<br>
<p>I propose a new prefix called &quot;ABUSE:&quot; for this purpose.  It should 
<br>
be used to complain about off-topic posts.  It should be used to 
<br>
complain about someone else's abuse of the list.  It should be used 
<br>
to flame abusive posters, insult people's motives, and beg people to 
<br>
more their discussion to another list.
<br>
<p>I propose the term &quot;ABUSE:&quot; for a number of reasons.  Some reports 
<br>
will be of actual abuse and should be discussed under this prefix. 
<br>
Other reports will be an overreaction or a form of harassment toward 
<br>
one individual or group, and will itself be a form of abuse.  The 
<br>
discussion of whether something is abuse of the list or not 
<br>
inevitably degenerates into insults, name-calling and never-ending 
<br>
circular arguments, which are against the rules and are their own 
<br>
form of list abuse.  Most cases of abuse should be handled off-list, 
<br>
and the insistence of complaining on-list is seen by some to be a 
<br>
form of abuse.  Any and all of these situations and their inevitable 
<br>
follow-ups should be combined under this prefix.
<br>
<p>Although most people would prefer not to see this topic at all, I 
<br>
think labelling it with an identifiable prefix would help mitigate 
<br>
the impact.  By using the prefix it designates a change of topic from 
<br>
the original discussion to a discussion about the discussion.  It 
<br>
keeps these discussions from occurring under unrelated subject lines. 
<br>
It helps other people avoid these discussion if they wish.  Even if 
<br>
some of the original posts of this nature are not properly prefixed, 
<br>
replies to those post could be.  This might help migrate such 
<br>
discussions into a thread with the prefix to help label it correctly.
<br>
<p>Please comment and participate in this new idea if you think it is 
<br>
worthwhile.  Please use the &quot;ABUSE:&quot; prefix in your responses!
