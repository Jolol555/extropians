</em><br>
<p>I pointed out that a view of rights rooted in human nature can't deal
<br>
with non-human entities, therefore we need a broader-based system.
<br>
<p>I think the onus is on you to demonstrate how a natural rights viewpoint
<br>
can extend to situations where the participants are non-human.
<br>
<p>And why are you insisting on judging other people by some objective
<br>
criterion? Can't you just admit that your own views of their behaviour
<br>
are subjective, and don't have any intrinsic merit or demerit?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, you haven't given a better paradigm yet nor has anyone else which
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You appear hostile to cultural relativism -- which, as far as I'm
<br>
concerned, is a vitally important viewpoint that needs to be nurtured
<br>
and cherished. (It's the best way of distinguishing fanatics from
<br>
people who you can negotiate with: the presence of relativism is an
<br>
indicator of flexibility.)
<br>
<p>Why are you opposed to relativism?
