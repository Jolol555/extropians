<p>Hooray!  Glad to hear the nay-sayers haven't worn you down.
<br>
<p>Before encountering your Low Beyond articles in '97, I had
<br>
already:
<br>
<p>1. Encountered the usual million-year timescales for the
<br>
replacement of humans by their successors in authors such as
<br>
Stapledon (_Last and First Men_, _Star Maker_) and Clarke
<br>
(_The City and The Stars_).
<br>
<p>2. Encountered near-future transcendence scenarios whose
<br>
plausibility as anything but entertainment vehicles was
<br>
weakened by reliance on extraterrestrial intervention
<br>
(Clarke's _Childhood's End_ and _2001_).
<br>
<p>3. Found a friend, whose intelligence I respect a great
<br>
deal, who took it for granted that within a thousand years
<br>
humans would have been replaced by some sort of amalgam of
<br>
cybernetics and genetically-engineered &quot;stuff&quot;.  His name
<br>
is Joe Fineman (he has posted to this list a few times in
<br>
the past, but not recently), and he's the **only** other
<br>
human being I've encountered in the flesh who actually
<br>
thinks about these things.  Unfortunately, his thousand-year
<br>
time-frame makes it impossible for him to take seriously,
<br>
or even suspend disbelief enough to read for pleasure,
<br>
**any** science fiction that's set in the far future but has
<br>
human beings in it (such as Clarke's _The City and the Stars_).
<br>
<p>4.  Read Vinge's _Marooned in Realtime_ and first heard
<br>
of the idea of the Singularity -- a sort of runaway inflation
<br>
of technological progress.   (I also read _A Fire Upon the
<br>
Deep_, was amused by the extrapolation of an interstellar
<br>
Usenet, and became familiar with the terminology therein --
<br>
Low Beyond, Transcend, Powers, etc.).
<br>
<p>5.  Read Moravec's _Mind Children_, and delighted in the
<br>
spectacle of an apparently reputable scientist being allowed
<br>
by a reputable publisher to set forth a timetable for the
<br>
creation of artifacts of human-level or greater intelligence
<br>
within the next 50 years, in a serious work of non-fiction.
<br>
<p>However, it was Yudkowsky's Web articles in which I first
<br>
encountered an apparently sane, intelligent, and articulate
<br>
person writing with panache and plausibility (and with a distinct
<br>
disinclination to pull punches for the sake of sparing the
<br>
reader's feelings, perhaps even a positive delight in
<br>
future shock &quot;pour epater la bourgeoisie&quot;) that all this
<br>
might (nay will, by Vinge) happen within reach of my own lifetime
<br>
(with a bit of luck -- on my part, that is).  Heady stuff, and
<br>
it sure got my adrenalin flowing when I encountered it, though
<br>
my acceptance of its plausibility waxes and wanes with the
<br>
moon.  I was instantly recruited as an agent of memetic replication
<br>
for this work, though my success in turning on other folks to
<br>
singularity.posthuman.com has been rather pale, even among
<br>
fellow computer programmers (very few even of computer programmers,
<br>
it turns out, are true technophiles or potential Singularitarians,
<br>
at least in the circles I find myself in at present -- this has
<br>
been a big disappointment to me!).
<br>
<p>First it was to be 2035 (IIRC).  That would be a stretch for
<br>
me (though I'm in reasonably good shape, apart from a touch of
<br>
arthritis) -- I'd be 83 that year.  Then 2025.  A more
<br>
comfortable target, for this baby boomer.  Now 2008, you say --
<br>
before I've even retired or paid off my mortgage!.
<br>
<p>2008 is near enough that I can almost taste it.  Let's see,
<br>
what do **I** expect for 2008?
<br>
<p>1.  On the computer front,  we'll be in the 2005-2010 timeframe
<br>
for those next-generation chip-manufacturing technologies that
<br>
Intel and IBM were touting recently -- extreme ultraviolet
<br>
(EUV) lithography, .07 micron line widths (IIRC), 10 gigahertz
<br>
clock rates, etc.  Perhaps 64-bit processors will be in the
<br>
mainstream by then, if the Itanium doesn't flop.  This will all
<br>
be on the typical desktop, along with RAM in the gigabyte
<br>
range, hard-disk storage in the hundreds of gigabytes.  With that
<br>
kind of processing power on the desktop, decent multimedia even
<br>
via low-bandwidth Internet is practical.
<br>
<p>2.  On the networking front, we may have really-high
<br>
bandwidth, guaranteed-service Internet 2 for the national
<br>
labs and big universities -- something that could support
<br>
surgery by telepresence, for example.  Probably no more people will
<br>
have access to this in 2008 than had access to the Internet in the
<br>
early 80's.  On the consumer front, Internet adoption
<br>
will probably have reached saturation (in the U.S. at least), at whatever
<br>
percentage that turns out to be; broadband penetration will still be
<br>
creeping along, and decent-speed, relatively cheap wireless Internet
<br>
access may prove to be the next big consumer app.  I guess my
<br>
office (at work) will be wired with gigabit Ethernet.
<br>
<p>3.  On the bio front, I have no idea.  Anti-aging therapy?
<br>
Smart drugs?  Better treatments for cancer, heart disease,
<br>
Alzheimers?  Who the hell knows?  But my expectations are rather
<br>
conservative on this front.
<br>
<p>4.  I don't expect SETI@home to contact any aliens, in the Virgo
<br>
Cluster or anywhere else :-&gt;
<br>
<p>Those are my surprise-free projections.
<br>
<p>Now lets see, Singularity, as described by Yudkowsky (IIRC), means
<br>
a runaway positive feedback loop engendered either by machines
<br>
having become sufficiently intelligent to design their own more-intelligent
<br>
successors, or IQ-boosted humans designing even more powerful IQ
<br>
boosts for **their** successors, or a combination of both -- skating
<br>
past slippery questions such as the meaning of &quot;intelligence&quot;, whether
<br>
computers have any meaningful similarities to brains, etc.
<br>
<p>Can I see a Singularity developing from my own surprise-free expectations
<br>
of 2008?  Well, it would have to depend on moderately better-than-present
<br>
hardware combined with moderately better-than-present networking combined
<br>
perhaps with a software breakthrough of some sort that would result in the birth of
<br>
genuine AI.
<br>
<p>In my very humble opinion (I am not Paul Saffo, Jaron Lanier, or anybody
<br>
else ever likely to be interviewed by John Dvorak on Tech TV's &quot;Big Thinkers&quot;)
<br>
I just don't see it happening.  I think the technology of 2008 will still
<br>
be too crude and macro-scale to compare with the fine-grained complexity
<br>
of biological machinery exhibiting the full range of behavior to which the
<br>
adjective &quot;intelligent&quot; (whatever the hell it means) is usually applied.  This would
<br>
still be true even if you could aggregate all the computers on the planet,
<br>
and will, I think, remain true in 2008.
<br>
<p>Now, that's the surprise-free scenario.  There is another possibility:
<br>
<p>5.  There will be a major paradigm shift of some sort.  A breakthrough
<br>
into the third dimension of micro-scale electronic circuitry, as Kurzweil
<br>
anticipates.  Molecular-scale computing.  Optical computing.  Quantum
<br>
computing.
<br>
<p>This is the sort of thing on which I focus my expectations of Singularity.
<br>
&quot;Cherchez la hardware&quot; is my motto (please forgive my French).
<br>
<p>Perhaps Eliezer would like to give us a clue as to which basis he's
<br>
counting on for the 2008 runaway -- (1) a software breakthrough on
<br>
somewhat-better-than-today hardware and networking, or (2) a major
<br>
paradigm shift in the hardware.  Or something else?  My guess for Eliezer is (1),
<br>
because of his writings on seed AIs, but my hope is (2) -- though even
<br>
if strong indications of such a shift have appeared by 2008, I wouldn't
<br>
expect to have reliable and cost-effective manufacturing processes or
<br>
commercial products by then.
<br>
<p>However, I'd love to be surprised!
<br>
<p>Jim F.
