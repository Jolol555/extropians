<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I see you deny the very concept of meaning being meaningful.

<em>&gt; &gt; This interpretation is probably not what you intended, but - you're entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; correct. There is no meaning. Even 'meaning' has no meaning, in a universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense of things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Actually it is precisely what I intended.  Thank you for verifying that

<p>He's not a nihilist; he's simply following the commonest theory of rights
<br>
on the planet -- one that's used by just about everyone except Americans
<br>
who've been indoctrinated with their state's peculiar constitutional
<br>
theory -- which is that rights are negotiated and conditional.
<br>
<p>A nihilist would deny that there's any _point_ in negotiating with others.
<br>
<p>You, for your part, appear to be as much a fundamentalist as a member of
<br>
the Southern Baptist Congregations: you believe in some absolute underlying
<br>
Truths (either revealed by the Lawwd God Almighty, or the Singularity, or
<br>
Human Nature(TM), or some other big source of revelation) against which
<br>
everything can be measured. This point of view has its pros and cons, but
<br>
you need to bear in mind that many other people see it as a blind spot.
