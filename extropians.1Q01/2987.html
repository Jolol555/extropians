[The following came from one of the green lists I monitor, suggesting one 
<br>
area in which extropians values of &quot;distributed power&quot; in the broadest sense 
<br>
coincide with the more clear-thinking elements of the green movement.  I 
<br>
continue to think that we may be on the verge of a revolution in power 
<br>
generation equal in importance to the impact of the &quot;micro-computer&quot; 
<br>
developments of the 1970s and 1980s, leading to a social change analogous to 
<br>
that caused by the Internet.]

<p>20TH CENTURY POWER SYSTEM INCOMPATIBLE WITH DIGITAL ECONOMY
<br>

<br>
<p>Study Calls for Greater Use of Micropower
<br>
<p>Today's giant coal and nuclear power plants are failing to provide the 
<br>
high-quality, reliable electricity needed to power the new digital economy, 
<br>
according to a new report from the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington, 
<br>
DC-based research organization.
<br>
Power interruptions due to the vulnerability of central power plants and 
<br>
transmission lines cost the United States as much as $80 billion annually.
<br>
&quot;We're beginning the 21st century with a power system that cannot take our 
<br>
economy where it needs to go,&quot; said Seth Dunn, author of Micropower: The 
<br>
Next Electrical Era. &quot;The kind of highly reliable power needed for today's 
<br>
economy can only be based on a new generation of micropower devices now 
<br>
coming on the market. These allow homes and businesses to produce their own 
<br>
electricity, with far less pollution.&quot;
<br>
The new micropower technologies, which include fuel cells, microturbines, 
<br>
and solar roofing, are as small as one-millionth the scale of today's coal 
<br>
or nuclear plants, and produce little if any of the air pollution of their 
<br>
larger cousins. Already, the multi-billion-dollar potential of the market 
<br>
for micropower has sent investors scrambling to buy into some of the new 
<br>
companies, sending their share prices soaring earlier this year.
<br>
One group of micropower technologies generates electricity by combustion. 
<br>
Reciprocating engines, traditionally fueled by diesel oil and once used 
<br>
largely for backup power, are increasingly fueled by natural gas and run 
<br>
throughout much of the day. Microturbines, advanced gas turbines derived 
<br>
from aerospace jet engines, are just starting to be mass-produced, shipped 
<br>
by the hundreds, and installed in drugstores, restaurants, and other U.S. 
<br>
commercial buildings. Stirling engines, which can run on wood chips and 
<br>
even solar heat, are becoming popular in European homes.
<br>
Other micropower systems rely on processes that do not involve combustion. 
<br>
Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that combine hydrogen and oxygen to 
<br>
produce electricity and water. Several hundred fuel cells are already 
<br>
operating worldwide, and will become commercially available for homes in 
<br>
the next one to two years.
<br>
Solar cells, or photovoltaics (PV), which use sunlight falling on 
<br>
semiconductor chips to produce electric current, have already entered the 
<br>
residential and commercial building market in nations such as Japan and 
<br>
Germany, and for off-grid use in developing nations. Wind power, the most 
<br>
cost-competitive renewable energy technology, is poised for rapid expansion 
<br>
in rural plains and offshore regions. Small geothermal, microhydro, and 
<br>
biomass systems also hold important roles in the emerging decentralized 
<br>
electricity system.
<br>
These small-scale generators have numerous advantages over large-scale 
<br>
power plants. Located close to where they are used, small-scale units can 
<br>
save electricity consumers millions of dollars by avoiding costly new 
<br>
investments in central power plants and distribution systems.
<br>
Micropower can also save homeowners and businesses millions of dollars by 
<br>
lowering the threat of power outages and subsequent lost productivity. An 
<br>
electricity grid with many small generators is inherently more stable than 
<br>
a grid served by only a few large plants. Banks, hospitals, restaurants, 
<br>
and post offices have been among the early adopters of micropower systems 
<br>
as a way to reduce their vulnerability to power interruptions. The First 
<br>
National Bank of Omaha, in Omaha, Nebraska, for example, responded to a 
<br>
costly computer system crash in 1997 by hooking its processing center up to 
<br>
two fuel cells that provide 99.9999% reliability.
<br>
Use of more efficient combustion-based micropower systems, relying 
<br>
primarily on natural gas, will substantially lower emissions of 
<br>
particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and heavy metals. These 
<br>
reductions would range from 50 to 100 percent, depending on the technology 
<br>
and pollutant.
<br>
The use of wind, solar power, and fuel cells fueled by hydrogen can also 
<br>
help reduce global carbon dioxide emissions, one third of which come from 
<br>
electricity generation. In the United States, widespread adoption of 
<br>
micropower could cut U.S. power plant carbon dioxide emissions in half. In 
<br>
developing nations, small-scale power could lower carbon emissions by 42 
<br>
percent relative to large-scale systems.
<br>
Micropower will allow developing countries to leapfrog to power sources 
<br>
that are cheaper and cleaner than building more coal or nuclear plants and 
<br>
extending existing transmission lines. Many of these countries lose the 
<br>
equivalent of 20 to 50 percent of their total power generated through leaks 
<br>
in their transmission and distribution systems. In rural regions, where 1.8 
<br>
billion people still lack access to electrical services, small-scale 
<br>
systems are already economically superior to the extension of transmission 
<br>
lines, and environmentally preferable to continued reliance on kerosene 
<br>
lanterns and diesel generators. To date, solar PV systems have been 
<br>
installed in more than half a million homes.
<br>
Despite micropower's potential benefits, current market rules in most 
<br>
countries favor the incumbent centralized model. Many electric utilities, 
<br>
moreover, perceive micropower systems as an economic threat, and are 
<br>
blocking their deployment by charging onerous connection fees and by paying 
<br>
low prices for power fed into the grid. Failure to reform these rules and 
<br>
practices could result in the construction of another generation of 
<br>
marginally improved large-scale power plants of questionable long-term 
<br>
economic and environmental value.
<br>
The extent to which current power markets favor short-sighted solutions is 
<br>
highlighted in the rush to construct some 100,000 megawatts of &quot;merchant 
<br>
plants&quot; worldwide. These large gas-fired power plants, marketed as the 
<br>
answer to power shortages, are designed to make money by selling power in 
<br>
newly deregulated electricity markets when demand and prices are high. But 
<br>
they have raised serious concerns among investors for their financial 
<br>
riskiness, and among grass-roots groups for their negative ecological 
<br>
impacts, as many are located in rural or pristine areas.
<br>
The risk of locking in outdated central power plants is even greater in the 
<br>
developing world. Over the next 20 years, some $1.7 trillion of capital 
<br>
investment in new power capacity is projected to take place in developing 
<br>
countries. &quot;These nations have a golden opportunity to get the rules right 
<br>
the first time, and set up markets that support power systems suitable for 
<br>
the 21st century and not the 20th,&quot; concludes Dunn.
