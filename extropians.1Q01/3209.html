<p>It is my Yopy PDA, from Samsung Electronics.  It has a 200 Mhz ARM processor, 32 MB of
<br>
storage and 16MB of memory.  It's color, with a touch screen and stylus, and game buttons.
<br>
It's the same size as a Palm, maybe thicker.  It came through Customs last week.
<br>
<p>Here is the web site <a href="http://www.gmate.co.kr/">http://www.gmate.co.kr/</a>.  There are other Linux PDAs, for example from
<br>
Compaq and other vendors.  There is news on the web page.

<br>
<p>There are also projects to run open source or free operating systems on practically any
<br>
processor.  For example, you can run Java on Palm.  3Com had people on Palm before the
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>I also have a PowerBook so I use Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX.
