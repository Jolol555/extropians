<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The amount of disinformation present out there is astounding, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent people are being sucked in.  One of my colleagues, an very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent and competent individual, is also extremely uncritical (he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't question the idea of 'psychic vibrations' at all until I challenged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him on his belief).  This attitude came as a big shock to me, as until
</em><br>
then
<br>
<em>&gt; I'd thought that intelligence and the tendency to think critically went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand-in-hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Psychic vibrations.. whoa man. Whoooaaaa!
<br>
<p>I'd bet we've got a million more stories like this, amongst us. This
<br>
possibly is the primary enemy of extropianism; creeping credulity, amongst
<br>
people who haven't been introduced to any way of making sound judgements
<br>
about things.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, I was seeing an australian clergyman of some note (???
<br>
Costello? brother of the treasurer?) interviewed recently. He was being
<br>
asked about new-agey kind of stuff, and what he thought about people taking
<br>
bits and pieces of Asian religions, as they felt best. He replied that he
<br>
thought it was disastrous, because what they took was the feel good stuff,
<br>
the easy stuff. They leave out the nasty stuff, the unglamorous parts, the
<br>
hard work.
<br>
<p>There's a lot of that going around, in general. Critical thinking is seen
<br>
quite sceptically, I think, by many people. Dont worry about the head, trust
<br>
your feelings. Trust your emotions. That'll be $10.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Reducing the 'sheep-effect' by introducing extropian concepts, science,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; encouraging a more questioning attitude must come under the heading of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'good thing'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An extropian outreach program!!  Now there's an idea .... (gotta be
</em><br>
careful
<br>
<em>&gt; it doesn't become dogmatic, though).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If it were to be done, it's probably better to leave most of extropianism
<br>
out. Just spread the futurist ideas, the science, the information, and the
<br>
optimism. Once people take that on board, the rest follows pretty much
<br>
automatically.
