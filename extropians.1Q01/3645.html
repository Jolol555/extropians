</em><br>
<p>Okay, granted.
<br>
<p>Trying to get to the root of things: what set me off was the assumption
<br>
that, if a group decides to use cream pies as a form of protest, it is
<br>
appropriate to treat this as serious assault or to sue them into bankruptcy.
<br>
This struck me as a deeply inappropriate, excessive, response ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, it is just a pie. I can think of a few peices of real damage it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would cause. First, it's going to ruin your shirt.
</em><br>
<p>Which is my point. A flan in the face is going to seriously annoy you and
<br>
maybe ruin your clothing (although most clothing is quite capable of 
<br>
surviving being doused in soap -- it should normally be nothing worse
<br>
than a dry-cleaning bill). Responding to it with assault charges and
<br>
demands for hundred-kilobuck fines and/or prison time is ridiculous. That
<br>
sort of response should be reserved for serious offenses.
<br>
<p>(To paraphrase: minor offenses deserve minor punishments. There's the
<br>
apocryphal tale of the Chinese emperor who instituted a draconian penal
<br>
code under which everything from rebellion to turning up late for work
<br>
had the same punishment -- death. One morning, his most gifted general
<br>
was late in to work due to a hang-over, and thought &quot;what the hell ...&quot;
<br>
Shortly thereafter, there was a new emperor.)
