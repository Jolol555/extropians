</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Let me clarify.  I realize that Zeb and I disagree on this point. 
<br>
When I said, &quot;Actually, you are right&quot; to Zeb, I was not agreeing 
<br>
with his position.  I was actually agreeing with his assessment of 
<br>
how our positions differ.
<br>
<p>Zeb seems to believe that these people do not think about their 
<br>
beliefs in a logical way and do not try to resolve the 
<br>
inconsistencies they find.  I believe that these people, and most 
<br>
people, do think about their beliefs, and they do try to resolve 
<br>
inconsistencies.  I think it is too convenient to dismiss people as 
<br>
irrational as an excuse not to debate their objections on their terms 
<br>
using their facts.
<br>
<p>Again, I know this is a minority view on this list.  However, I have 
<br>
had a lot of personal experience with Christians, occultists, 
<br>
creationists, animal-rights advocates, environmentalists, and various 
<br>
political groups.  They all sincerely believe in their goals.  They 
<br>
spend a lot of time researching and supporting their goals.  Where 
<br>
there is counter evidence, they spend a lot of time refuting the 
<br>
counter evidence.  It is too simplistic to assume that they have not 
<br>
really looked into the issue or thought about it rationally.
<br>
<p>For example, PETA believes that animals have rights.  This is a very 
<br>
difficult thing to prove or disprove logically.  However, given this 
<br>
assumption, that animals have rights, most of their other views are 
<br>
completely consistent.  If animals have rights, they should not be 
<br>
owned or kept locked up.  if animals have rights, they should not be 
<br>
used for medical experiments.  If animals have rights, they cannot be 
<br>
sold or exchanged as property.  If animals have rights, they should 
<br>
not be slaughtered for food.  These are perfectly rational beliefs. 
<br>
Just substitute &quot;human&quot; or &quot;child&quot; in place of &quot;animal&quot; to see what a 
<br>
consistent set of beliefs would look like.
<br>
<p>Now some people will argue that animals are happier as pets than they 
<br>
would be in the wild.  While this is perfectly reasonable, imagine 
<br>
saying that humans would be happier owned as slaves rather than left 
<br>
to fend for themselves.  Some people will argue that animal 
<br>
experimentation leads to medical breakthroughs that save more animals 
<br>
than are killed.  While this is perfectly reasonable, imagine saying 
<br>
that we should experiment on humans without permission because it 
<br>
will save more humans than would be sacrificed.  Although the 
<br>
animal-rights positions may seem irrational at first glance, they 
<br>
actually are obvious ramifications of the core belief that animals 
<br>
have rights.  These ideas are logically derived from that core belief 
<br>
and are not random ideas with no logical structure.  Understanding 
<br>
the core beliefs is key to understanding and predicting any belief 
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>(Note:  I am not supporting PETA here.  I am merely showing that 
<br>
their actions and motivations are logically derived from the core 
<br>
belief that animals have rights.)
<br>
<p>I'll say it again, most people on this list try to project their own 
<br>
beliefs onto opponents.  This leads to poor debating techniques, 
<br>
misrepresentation of the issues, and total failure to accurately 
<br>
predict opinions and actions of the opponents.  If you think your 
<br>
opponents are acting irrationally, it actually is an indication that 
<br>
you don't understand their actions.  Even hallucinating or insane 
<br>
people act in predictable ways deriving out of their own set of 
<br>
erroneous beliefs.  When someone dismisses an opponent as being 
<br>
irrational, what they really mean is that they don't understand and 
<br>
are not interested in investigating.
