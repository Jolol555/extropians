<em>&gt;Russell forwards a column by James C. Bennett:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  In California, some dim bulb (so to speak) had the amazing concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  deregulating the prices power companies would have to pay to power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  suppliers for their power, without deregulating the price at which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; could sell power to consumers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From what I've read about the crisis, this is not why the price freeze was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put into place.  It was actually done to benefit the utility companies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to guarantee them profits.  At the time of deregulation wholesale prices
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had been low for decades, and the reason for deregulation was to bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down retail prices, which had remained stubbornly high.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your analysis, as far as I can tell.
<br>
<p>What confuses me about this crisis is all the blame on NIMBYs and 
<br>
environmental laws for causing the problem.  The talk of opening up 
<br>
Alaska and Florida oil drilling also confuses me.  Although these 
<br>
might be worthy issues to discuss, they have nothing to do with the 
<br>
current crisis.  The problem is not being caused by a shortage of 
<br>
power plants (caused by NIMBYs) or lack or oil (caused by 
<br>
environmental restrictions on drilling).  The problem is a shortage 
<br>
of money.  The power is there, but nobody will pay for it.  End-user 
<br>
prices don't cover the cost of the electricity.  The utilities are 
<br>
bankrupt so they can't pay.
<br>
<p>The California utilities had their power cut off because they failed 
<br>
to pay their last bill.  Utilities in other states who can still pay 
<br>
for power are still getting it.  When President Bush ordered the 
<br>
other states to not cut off power, the power came back on.  There is 
<br>
no lack of power.  There is a lack of solvent utility companies. 
<br>
There is no question about how to get the power back on.  The only 
<br>
question is who is going to pay for it.
