<em>&gt; &gt;The best way to know when an extremist is about to attack is to listen to them get indignantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;defensive, which typically happens whenever someone does not absolutely agree with them
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, _very_ true. And, contrariwise, attacks are not the only sign of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremism, any more than workplace shootings are the only sign of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly unhappy worker. But not all extremists, it seems to me, attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly. Some attack indirectly.
</em><br>
<p>News flash: I'll be getting more soon, but I just found out through my
<br>
father that one of the Wakefield victims was a friend of my father and
<br>
his coworkers at Ruger. This man was an FFL holder, and a two time
<br>
president of SCAT, a shooting club near Wakefield. Because company
<br>
policy prohibited firearms in the workplace, he had no firearm to defend
<br>
himself and his coworkers in the building during the shooting (a policy
<br>
which the assailant evidently did not obey), despite having a difficult
<br>
to obtain Massachusetts Concealed Weapons Permit. One more statistic
<br>
that only law abiding people obey gun laws, and die for it every day.
<br>
(Yes, Joe, this does belong on exi-freedom... i do encourage everyone to
<br>
move it over there....)
