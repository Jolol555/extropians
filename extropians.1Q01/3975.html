<em>&gt; I took a trip to PETA's website (which is pretty and very nicely done) but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't find a single instance of an alternative use of the lives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domesticated animals.  Should we let them go free?  I seem to remember a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story about a group of eco-terrorists in France who released a whole bunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of minks (or similar critter) from a fur farm.  The poor things promptly ran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away right into traffic where a bunch were killed.  Can you imagine what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would happen if we set pigs free to roam the forrests?
</em><br>
<p>This isn't the real problem.  Even if people do decide to stop eating
<br>
animals, it won't happen overnight.  Herds will gradually decrease over a
<br>
period of years as farmers breed less due to decreased demand.  We won't
<br>
have to decide what to do with millions of unwanted cows and hogs.
<br>
<p>The issue, rather, is that a bunch of &quot;potential&quot; animals, who would
<br>
have been born, raised, slaughtered and eaten, won't be born at all.
<br>
The total number of cow-minutes of life will be greatly reduced, and
<br>
likewise for other food animals.
<br>
<p>Whether you see this as good or bad might depend on how you view the
<br>
quality of life of farm animals today.
