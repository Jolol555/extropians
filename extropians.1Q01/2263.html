<p>
Hello:
<br>
<p>Many religions have sexual taboos that prevent people from openly discussing
<br>
matters of a sexual nature.
<br>
<p>Back in the days after the Manhattan Project, they were beginning to harness
<br>
the power of the atom.
<br>
<p>In the early 50's, much thought was going into the creation of robots and
<br>
androids.
<br>
<p>When I was 8 years old, I was sodomized by a neighbor.  A teenager named
<br>
Michael O'Brien who lived a few houses down the street.  He held his hand
<br>
over my mouth while I screamed in pain, and barely a sound came out.  He
<br>
agreed to take his hand off my mouth only when I &quot;nodded&quot; that I would keep
<br>
it a secret for the rest of my life.  Otherwise, he would &quot;kill me,&quot; he
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>I forgot about the incident until my mid-twenties.
<br>
<p>When I went through puberty, I had the irresistible urge to have intercourse
<br>
with anything I could get my hands on.
<br>
<p>My dad had taught me how to cut a hole in the top of a Sunkist orange to
<br>
squeeze the juice out.
<br>
<p>One day, when I was 17, I was watching a VHS porno tape and got so excited I
<br>
couldn't stand it.  I looked around and thought about anything with a hole.
<br>
I thought about children, animals, things I could make, pot roasts,
<br>
anything.  I looked beneath the upward turned tail of our 125 pound Alaskan
<br>
Malamute and gave it serious thought.  Too dirty, I concluded, and it might
<br>
hurt the dog.
<br>
<p>I went into the kitchen and got a Sunkist orange and cut a hole in it.  Then
<br>
I put it in the microwave long enough to warm it up to flesh temperature,
<br>
maybe a little warmer but not too hot.  I took off my clothes in went into
<br>
the shower and masturbated with the orange, using Flex brand conditioner as
<br>
a lubricant.  That was my first orgasm.
<br>
<p>I wonder if my neighbor had known about the orange whether or not he would
<br>
have raped me (and my brother)?
<br>
<p>The small acrylic lamp globe I play with has a diameter of about 14&quot;.  There
<br>
are smaller globes with the diameter of 7&quot;.  What if these were to be filled
<br>
with silicone, and a small hole placed in the middle, and given to teenagers
<br>
like my neighbor so he could make it through the insanity of puberty without
<br>
permanently damaging the kids his mother baby-sits?
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sexfantasyzone.com/sexincan.html">http://www.sexfantasyzone.com/sexincan.html</a>
<br>
<p>The product exists, but costs about $70.  A lot of profit, I suppose.
<br>
<p>A scientist with the means might just choose to clone a beautiful model and
<br>
grow her into a perfect concubine (see Sharky's Machine
<br>
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0083064">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0083064</a> ).  An expert in brains and neuroanatomy
<br>
might find away to completely eliminate the sensory systems of this human
<br>
doll, and give it only a motor system controlled by a nanocomputer or
<br>
quantum computer.
<br>
<p>A very sophisticated dildo, with flesh and bone.
<br>
<p>Such creatures would have the consciousness of a piece of steak.  However,
<br>
the computers controlling them could make them behave &quot;as if&quot; they were
<br>
responding to stimulate.  You could tell it a joke, the supercomputer with
<br>
animate the puppet with all the perfect emotional reactions, laughter,
<br>
smiles, glances, shifting of body posture.  It would be indistinguishable
<br>
from the outside to something with real feelings, provided the puppetry
<br>
software and hardware was sufficiently sophisticated.
<br>
<p>I've thought about it.  Could I tell the difference?  Could it be programmed
<br>
to provide perfect feedback?  The be &quot;ready when you are&quot; so to speak.
<br>
Lubricated when necessary, like a doll that wets itself when you push a
<br>
button?
<br>
<p>Personally, I'd prefer something with &quot;real consciousness&quot; and &quot;real
<br>
emotions&quot;.  But could it still be programmable to a certain degree?  What if
<br>
an automated scripting system was capable of generating a set of
<br>
contingencies, possible courses of action and behavior, far beyond what any
<br>
human could imagine.  A script with a billion different outcomes and
<br>
branches.
<br>
<p>The android could use a real human limbic system (reptile brain) to
<br>
experience emotions, and those emotions could be interfaced to do the
<br>
&quot;choosing&quot; between options in the set of possible scripts.  To a degree, the
<br>
being would have &quot;free will&quot;, although it would really be &quot;choosing&quot; between
<br>
millions or billions of precomputed behavioral trajectories.
<br>
<p>What if I had a nanocomputer in my brain?  What if my limbic system is real.
<br>
I feel the same feelings as any other person.  But my thoughts are generated
<br>
by a supercomputer scripting system?  Am I a human?  Am I a machine?  Do I
<br>
have a right to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?&quot;  Am I
<br>
exercising &quot;free will&quot; when choosing between my precomputed alternatives?
