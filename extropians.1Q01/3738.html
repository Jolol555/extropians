<p><em>&gt; The question that arises for me is whether the second part of the passage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quoted above contains an honest criticism of high-trust civil societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without a doubt, there is a high level of conformity in thought and behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US and other such cultures.  Conformity to VALUES of respect for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autonomy of others is good, but reflexive conformity to IDEAS is inimical to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the proper functioning of a free society.  The challenge, so far as I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned, is how to encourage the one without the other.  This is obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible in theory: &quot;Meta-values&quot; of tolerance and polite skepticism serve to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curb the tendency that high-trust societies may have to fall into shallow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; channels of &quot;group-think&quot;.  In practice, this task is obviously difficult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We see in all high-trust societies (I'm thinking of the US, England, Germany,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scandinavia and Japan) a significant propensity for the great majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to accept a &quot;standard model&quot; of how their lives should be lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without any question or deep understanding of how that set of behaviors has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come to be or why they might or might not be the best way they could live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The irony is that because high-trust cultures with functioning civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies provide a comfortable basic level of &quot;social security&quot;, people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow up in such cultures are more able to simply accept the status quo as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;proper&quot; basis for life (to use that galling English adjective that sums up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so many unquestioned assumptions) and never develop the habits of mind that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from deep questioning of the world around them.  This breeds complacency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, ultimately, a kind of chauvinism that is inimical to the very kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress that made those societies possible in the first place.  More
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstractly, there seems to be an inherent paradox in our current cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scene, where healthy skepticism about social issues has led to the paralysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of post-modernist subjectivism, which is itself incompatible with many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic functions of trust and civility.  All of which has brought me over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years that I have considered these questions to the conclusion that only by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; returning to the root values of the Enlightenment can we balance both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good that comes from trust with the need for on-going skepticism.
</em><br>
<p>Wow, what an excellent analysis. I couldn't agree with you more. I've been
<br>
grappling with these ideas for many years. Having now lived in three out of four
<br>
corners of the US (Florida, Connecticut, and now California), I am upon
<br>
reflection amazed at how differently trust and complacency are manifested in
<br>
different regions, but also by how they do seem to go hand in hand. I now live
<br>
in a small town in south-central CA, and people here are, for the most part,
<br>
open, trusting, friendly, kind and extremely complacent. This baffles me,
<br>
because the ability to have trust in my immediate social group (with skeptical
<br>
alertness) has always been one of the things that has allowed me to examine the
<br>
world more critically. Having the same kind of &quot;social security&quot; that allows
<br>
others to accept the status quo has given me the freedom to question it. And
<br>
it's not like I grew up in a household of skeptics. Quite the opposite. My
<br>
father was a career military man who retired from the service and immediately
<br>
became a career civil servant at a Naval base. I was raised in an environment
<br>
where not only was the status quo not questioned, but the concept of a status
<br>
quo could not even be recognized or articulated. It simply wasn't a part of
<br>
reality. Why I turned out to be such a trouble maker is beyond my comprehension!
