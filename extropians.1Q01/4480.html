<em>&gt; He was miffed because of media portrayals of millennium nuts as being

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Also, in the United States, religion is a hot botton issue.  Attack some
<br>
religious views and it's seen as an attack on the believers of those
<br>
religions or perhaps the believers of all religions.  I usually tell people
<br>
I respect their right to hold stupid views.:)  (Of course, this is not to
<br>
say I don't hold many stupid views myself.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The speech conflates several different issues - some cases of ridiculous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior, like punishing the 8-year-old kisser, with some not-so-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculous cases, like the media portrayals of millenium nuts.  Standard

</em><br>
<p>You got that right.  However, the particular hodge podge here is the result
<br>
of a certain package-dealing typical in the United States.  American
<br>
conservatives like Heston tend to have a particular mix of positions -- some
<br>
tenable, others not -- that are peculiar to American culture.  Their
<br>
official rivals, American Liberals (welfare statist for those in other
<br>
countries, as &quot;liberal&quot; here means someone who is for ever more government),
<br>
tend to hold an opposing mix and neither side looks for a dialectical
<br>
resolution of these differences.
<br>
<p>Nor do they try to rationally reconstruct their views.  Instead, both tend
<br>
to just refine stuff that will support their prejudices and slug it out with
<br>
the other side, as if, to paraphrase Camille Paglia, 2300 years of Western
<br>
Civilization only gave us two options in everything.  Round and round we
<br>
go...
<br>
<p>Cheers!
