<em>&gt;So, while this may be a &quot;good&quot; application, it does appear that society is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;objectives which the majority in a society accept as &quot;good&quot;. This will be

</em><br>
<em>&gt;attention to the rights of minorities. Just because they are &quot;different&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't mean they have to be fined or locked up.  Where does being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;different&quot; shade into being &quot;criminal&quot;?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the other hand, this technology is not being used to fine people or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lock them up. Instead it is being used to make the unwanted (criminal?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behaviour impossible to carry out. This seems a less threatening way for the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;pot have no effect on people, or an added ingredient to beer that stops
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people getting drunk, or a car that refuses to drive with a drunk driver,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc. Is it likely in future that there will be far fewer people in prison

<p>What I want to know is: Does this system allow you to exceed the &quot;speed 
<br>
limit&quot; in an emergency, such as an evasive maneuver, passing, or trying to 
<br>
get away from a homicidal maniac who has disabled said system in HIS car...
<br>
<p>How long do you think it will be after such a system is mandated until the 
<br>
powers that be start collecting data from it for &quot;enforcement&quot; purposes?
<br>
<p>I envision a rise in suicides and violent  interpersonal behavior if 
<br>
there's no way in society to &quot;blow off steam&quot; because some benevolent Big 
<br>
Brother won't allow it - passively...
