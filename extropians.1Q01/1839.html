<p><em>&gt; Regarding the idea of a &quot;self-reporting&quot; gun, I think such a thing has a lot

</em><br>

<p>This reminds me of th facet of medeival Icelandic law (according to David
<br>
Friedman, anyway) where a killing was only considered &quot;murder&quot; if it was
<br>
hidden and no formal attempt to notify the neighbors made.
