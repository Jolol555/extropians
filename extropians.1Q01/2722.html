<em>&gt; I have a cool idea for a TV ad that I think will sell a lotta
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this idea to someone in the biz.  I dont even care how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get for it, as that isnt my usual line of business, but I
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somebody help me out here:  how do I do it?  Is there a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to copyright a simple idea?  Its a funny little skit sorta
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be made into a commercial.  Do I write it down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and send it to, say the Gap?  Or find out what company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes ads for the Gap and send it to them, and ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a few hundred bucks if they use it?  Do I need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a hard copy, notarize it with a date and send it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to some reliable third party?  Can I send it to several ad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies and tell them the first one to send me 500 clams
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may use the idea?  Thanks in advance, spike
</em><br>
<p>Figure out what products would use your idea. Find out what ad agencies
<br>
manage those accounts. Contact the ad agency and talk to whoever manages
<br>
the account, tell them you have an idea that you'd like to bounce off
<br>
them, but you want a NDA signed first. Get the NDA signed, notarized,
<br>
then give them the idea. If they want it, they'll buy it. Make sure you
<br>
describe possible variants so they can't just blow you off and make an
<br>
ad that is kinda like your idea. The ad agencies will take care of
<br>
selling the ad idea to the manufacturer.
