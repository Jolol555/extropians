<em>&gt;  &gt;something wrong with his ballot when he began to use it. He took
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it up to a poll worker (probably a Democrat :-0) to point out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;problem and was basically told &quot;too bad.&quot; This caused him to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to choose between either voting for a candidate other than the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;he had intended to vote for, or not having his vote count at all.
</em><br>
<p>This has been commonly reported in our local Florida papers.  There 
<br>
were so many people making mistakes that they quickly realized that 
<br>
they would run out of ballots.  They stopped giving out ballots for 
<br>
corrections.  People were stuck with the choice of throwing away 
<br>
their entire ballot or submitting most of their votes with at least 
<br>
one wrong vote on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Last I knew the majority of the uncounted absentee ballots were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the military, and it was the dems who tried to prevent their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inclusion, so this would not have changed the outcome.
</em><br>
<p>There were a lot of technicalities argued on both sides. 
<br>
Technically, absentee ballots without postmarks must be thrown away. 
<br>
Military mail usually does not have postmarks, so military absentee 
<br>
ballots usually get thrown away.  The Republicans wanted to ignore 
<br>
this bad rule and allow the military ballots to count (because they 
<br>
tended to favor Republicans).  On the other side, technically, 
<br>
write-in votes for Al Gore are thrown out because you aren't supposed 
<br>
to write-in a candidate if they have a punch-hole.  Republicans threw 
<br>
these ballots out while Democrats wanted them counted.
<br>
<p>Under Florida State law, the &quot;voter intent&quot; is supposed to override 
<br>
all rules and determine the vote.  However, both parties argued for 
<br>
&quot;voter intent&quot; where it suited them and against &quot;voter intent&quot; where 
<br>
it did not suit them.  Neither party really wanted to count all the 
<br>
votes.  Both parties filed multiple lawsuits to stop vote counting in 
<br>
some sector they disfavored.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;of black voters being turned away at the polls due to rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;suspicious technical snafus, and various other problems, and to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;we have a highly suspect election.
</em><br>
<p>This also has been widely reported in local papers.  Apparently, a 
<br>
lot of police districts set up police roadblocks in front of black 
<br>
polling places and arrested anybody with an outstanding warrant. In 
<br>
other districts, they put an officer at the polling place who then 
<br>
arrested anybody showing ID who had an outstanding warrant.
<br>
<p>Another snafu that has been reported was that the state accidentally 
<br>
disqualified anybody who had ever been arrested instead of just 
<br>
removing convicted felons.  Statistically, this affected blacks more 
<br>
often than whites.
<br>
<p>A third issue was that driver-license registrations from black 
<br>
districts seemed to have been lost.  Everyone who registered to vote 
<br>
at certain driver license stations were told that they were not 
<br>
registered.
<br>
<p>One story that popularized the problems was a local black college in 
<br>
Orlando that bussed their entire student body to the registration and 
<br>
later to the polls.  Not one of their students was allowed to voted. 
<br>
Every one had been disqualified due to some snafu somewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Individual claims should be investigated. Some of the claims were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;erroneous however. After the democratic initiated telemarketer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;campaign was launched, the number of complaints was considerably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher than the number of votes cast for example.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that this is statistically possible.  The voter turnout was 
<br>
very high, certainly a majority.  Even if every single Democrat in 
<br>
the county called in to complain, they could not outnumber the total 
<br>
number of voters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;My statement about us not really having a president
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;was just me tossing off a personal opinion
</em><br>
<p><p>Look for more controversy when the media-initiated vote counts show 
<br>
that Al Gore actually received more legal votes than Bush.  I don't 
<br>
know if it is being reported at the national level yet, but a few of 
<br>
the counties have already reported finding hundreds of legal votes 
<br>
for Gore that were mistakenly thrown out.  A lessor number of votes 
<br>
are being found for Bush, but Gore is over 1000 votes ahead with only 
<br>
a few counties reporting.  One county reports that over 900 Gore 
<br>
votes were thrown out by a Republican-run canvassing board because 
<br>
they also punched the hole for Al Gore, and that was two votes for 
<br>
President.  (Note that this required hand-counting the votes to find 
<br>
these and remove them since the machine-count originally counted 
<br>
these as a Gore vote since the machines don't read the write-in vote!)
<br>
<p>Although we may be sick of this topic, the controversy is not over. 
<br>
I believe that history will record that Bush was legally installed 
<br>
after Gore won the election because the counting mechanism was in 
<br>
error.
