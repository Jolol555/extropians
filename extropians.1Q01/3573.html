<em>&gt;In what way is a flan in the face comparable to rape?
</em><br>
<p>They're both forms of physically attacking someone.  The impact upon 
<br>
the individual is a subjective issue that you have no right to 
<br>
discount one way or the other.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; You just don't get it.  When someone does something physically to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  against your will, it's a violation of your person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are taking an absolutist position: that *any* physical act is morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and practically equivalent to the most serious conceivable physical act.
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm not.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that we're talking about physical acts that don't cause 
<br>
physical damage.
<br>
<p>My argument is that you have no right to judge the effects of 
<br>
violating my physical person.  Just because you think a pie in the 
<br>
face is no big deal doesn't give you the right to pie me.  I'm sure 
<br>
that many fist fighters who are used to taking a punch would think 
<br>
that a slap in the face is no big deal, but I personally don't agree 
<br>
with that.
<br>
<p>So, it's not that they're all equivalent - it's that you (as a 
<br>
private citizen, not in the act of self defense) have no right to 
<br>
cross the line of physical attack and dictate what is and isn't 
<br>
&quot;going too far&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I do not buy that position. It is self-evidently wrong. (*Why* it appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-evidently wrong to me is an interesting issue that I need to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and think about.)
</em><br>
<p>Probably because you think a pie in the face is no big deal to you - 
<br>
so you extend that valuation of the event to others.
<br>
<p>What I'm saying is that not everyone else feels the way you do.  We 
<br>
all have different idiosyncrasies about how, when, and where we don't 
<br>
wish to be touched - particularly in forced physical situations.
<br>
<p>While you may not mind a pie in the face, I really would.  While you 
<br>
may not mind being doused in urine, I really would.  While I may not 
<br>
mind being groped by strange women, my wife would most certainly mind 
<br>
being groped by strange men.
<br>
<p>One of the clear places where we can (and do) draw a clear line 
<br>
between acceptable and unacceptable interaction is at the point of 
<br>
physically attacking someone.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; By your logic, if someone is mocking me and I don't like it, I should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  be able to have my bodyguards go shove a pie in his face or do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  something else equally assaulting and degrading.  Might makes right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  huh?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nope. Go shove the pie in his face yourself. Don't be surprised if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shove one right back at you, too.
</em><br>
<p>Why should I get my hands dirty?  In protest groups aimed at pieing, 
<br>
it comes down to just one person actually performing the act.  How do 
<br>
they choose?  I choose by paying some big guy to humiliate the person 
<br>
mocking me.
<br>
<p>Why are you dictating terms regarding how I can have a pie shoved in 
<br>
someone's face?  I think we're getting a little closer to the true 
<br>
point of our disagreement.  My impression is that you think that it's 
<br>
okay for some protest group to attack someone like Bill Gates with a 
<br>
pie in the face, but if Bill Gates' organization did likewise to some 
<br>
poor sap that he didn't like, you'd have a problem with it. 
<br>
Personally, I don't like that kind of arbitrary dehumanizing 
<br>
double-standard.
<br>
<p>Besides, what is this, some Three Stooges episode where everyone is 
<br>
armed with pies?  Bill Gates is supposed to walk through the airport 
<br>
with an armful of pies so that he can stoop to the level of his 
<br>
attackers?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Look, think of it as one point on a continuum:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;* You don't object to someone mocking you verbally.
</em><br>
<p>No forced physical contact; annoying, but acceptable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;* Suppose someone dresses up as a mime and follows you around, apeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   your movements and taking the piss. Is *that* harmful?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not familiar with the expression &quot;taking the piss&quot;, but other 
<br>
than that, you're once again not talking about physical contact; very 
<br>
annoying but acceptable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;* (cream pie goes here)
</em><br>
<p>Here we've crossed the abundantly clear line into physical contact 
<br>
and assault.  The attacker has left his legal rights behind and 
<br>
violated my person.  I may not mind a pie in the face, I may really 
<br>
mind it.
<br>
<p>[other physically assaulting examples snipped]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This continuum runs from forms of criticism that are harmless to forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;criticism that are lethal.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with your argument is that the situations you described 
<br>
don't form a continuum.  There's a huge discontinuity at the point of 
<br>
physical assault.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Now, as far as I can tell, your position is that there should be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difference in response to being groped v.s. a serious rape attack: they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both bad and evil. By extension, there should be no difference in response
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to a pie in the face, or a hand grenade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Is that an accurate characterisation of your view?)
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;My point of view is simply that the response should be proportional to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any perceived threat, and that treating a cream pie in the face the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same way as a pistol (or a plateful of turds) is silly.
</em><br>
<p>My point is that human interaction is an enormously complex and 
<br>
subjective issue.  We try to draw lines between acceptable and 
<br>
unacceptable interactions in order to facilitate peaceful 
<br>
coexistence.  One line that is clear, both societally and legally, is 
<br>
physical assault.  You have no right to physically take control of my 
<br>
person in order to subject me to your will - whether it's to shove a 
<br>
pie in my face, or to punch me, or even to give me a big sloppy kiss.
<br>
<p>When you cross that line, expect the punishment that you receive to 
<br>
include a punitive element to account for my own subjective view of 
<br>
the damage that you did.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
