Eliezer writes, quoting Hal:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One example I can think of is sperm cells, which compete to see which can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get into the egg first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sperm compete with other males' sperm.
</em><br>
<p>I meant that they would be competing with other sperm cells from the
<br>
same male, the same insemination.  There is a race to the finish line
<br>
and the fastest and fittest sperm gets there first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think there's any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlation between the fitness of a particular sperm and the particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chromosome set a sperm contains, so it's hard to see how competion could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur or how artificial competition could be adaptive for the male. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Though the *female's* genes have an interest in combining only with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy sperm.)
</em><br>
<p>While sperm fitness would not correlate with the majority of phenotype
<br>
selective factors (like brains, brawn and beauty), it does relate to very
<br>
basis issues like DNA damage and metabolic fitness.  Some sperm are pretty
<br>
pathetic and can barely survive, and there is a good chance that something
<br>
is wrong with their DNA.  The &quot;swim for life&quot; is a blunt filter but one
<br>
which plausibly plays a role in maintaining evolutionary fitness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Speaking of the sperm example, I've also read that bees use competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to decide which get to reproduce, in much the same way.  The queen bee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flies as high as possible and only the strongest males can fly up to it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and mate.  I don't know whether ants use a similar selection mechanism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but it would make sense if they do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is competition between reproductive entities, and thus not really a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case in point.
</em><br>
<p>All of the bees are from the same hive, as I understand it, so if we think
<br>
of the hive as a reproductive entity then this is competition within that
<br>
entity.  In fact the bees are like sperm cells and the competition plays
<br>
the same role in terms of filtering out weaker and less fit individuals.
