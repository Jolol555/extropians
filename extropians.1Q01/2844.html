Even further confirms my opinion that most French &quot;intellectuals&quot;
<br>
are conformist windbags.  Interesting excerpt:
<br>
<p>&quot;M Bruno's views, published in the newspaper Libération,
<br>
has sparked an angry backlash from Potter fans in France,
<br>
where the four novels have sold more than a million copies.&quot;
<br>
<p>Reminds me of my time in France.  I thought I'd spend time
<br>
taking in some of the &quot;local cinema&quot; long touted by Parisian
<br>
intellectuals.  *Yawn*.  No wonder most French - to the horror
<br>
of the chattering classes - prefer American movies (emphasis
<br>
on the &quot;to move&quot; root of the word &quot;movie&quot;).
