In 1957, the Air Force dropped a ten megaton nuclear
<br>
bomb outside Albuquerque. In 1967, two, twenty four
<br>
megaton bombs in North Carolina; five of six failsafes
<br>
were tripped on one bomb—the one with the parachute,
<br>
mind you. The other one they never found. The chute
<br>
didn't open and it went into soft ground. Somewhere.
<br>
It's still there. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima was
<br>
one-fiftieth of one megaton.
<br>
<p>Nuclear warheads do not eat through their own
<br>
containment mechanisms.
<br>
<p>Three more bombs off Delaware and two in Texas the
<br>
same year. Another off Georgia the next year. Two more
<br>
on Spain in 1966. Four more on Greenland in '68…
<br>
Detonators have gone off. The same year we torpedoed
<br>
our own sub with two nukes on board. Classified for
<br>
twenty five years. It's still going on; it just hasn't
<br>
been declassified yet. The Russian record is, of
<br>
course, far worse.
<br>
<p>As to reactors: Browns Ferry, I believe it was, nearly
<br>
burned to the ground because some idiot with a LIGHTER
<br>
or a candle was poking it into FLAMMABLE
<br>
insulation--AND the redundant wiring ran right
<br>
alongside the primary wiring. Windscale, Chernobyl,
<br>
Three Mile Island all released radiation into the
<br>
atmosphere. We release self-replicating nannites,
<br>
ONCE, and it's over.
<br>
<p>We are not competent to control nanotechnology.

<p>Really?  And when have nuclear weapons been used by
<br>
mistake?  I don't see
<br>
how simply increasing the possible consequences would
<br>
cause us to *reduce*
<br>
the current safeguards or make an accident more
<br>
likely.  Quite the
<br>
opposite.
