<p>Scorched is said too much: the primordial stuff out there at the periphery
<br>
has usually never seen anything hotter than few 10 K. (It gets downright
<br>
cooked whenever a body gets flung solwards; see comets). You don't need at 
<br>
all much to denaturate that, even after brief exposure. If you have a piece 
<br>
of certified urgunk with a few-billion year old surface, and that surface 
<br>
shows signs of being subject to sudden flashes, and you can date when 
<br>
the flash came, due to subsequent microimpact erosion, it could be 
<br>
interesting. This would also help with estimating frequency of nasty bright
<br>
events like supernova and gamma flashes, because the record must be out 
<br>
there. Also, the primeordial debris cloud seems to end rather sharply, 
<br>
being possibly stripped off some rather violent event. There might be still 
<br>
traces of that possible event buried out there. We'd be stupid not
<br>
too look at that record at the earliest opportunity.

<p><em>&gt; solar system, you don't have to worry about present day military gear

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The amount of EMP necessary to fry the electronics should be invisible
<br>
to an uninstrumented human. If it's dark, you might see really bright 
<br>
aurora, but that's about it. It's just like a global NEMP nuke without
<br>
the fireball (because the source is somewhere at the galactic center).
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I take it the &quot;EMP&quot; will be caused by heavy particles traveling at sublight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speeds. If it's pure radiation, the first warning we get will also be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last thing we ever see...
</em><br>
<p>It can't be photonic radiation, but it has to be pretty relativistic, so 
<br>
there would be not much warning coming. A wave of this should be shocking
<br>
interstellar medium and anything denser than that, though, so you should
<br>
see the neighbourhood lighting up as it passes. If a wave is still travelling
<br>
out there (since there's no point in looking at megayear windows due to
<br>
low probability that such a thing is about to hit us, other risks must
<br>
have higher priorities), you should be able to map it by looking as it lits
<br>
gas and dust clouds.
<br>
<p>The point is still: are there hints that such a thing exists, or was the 
<br>
warning I read utter bogus? Amara? Anybody else?
