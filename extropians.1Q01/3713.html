Denis Bider passed on a message from a fellow in Yugoslavia which evoked some 
<br>
ideas about the general role of history and culture on the political and 
<br>
ethical aspects of extropianism.
<br>
<p>In a message dated 2/1/01 12:43:57 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:denis.bider@globera.com?Subject=Re:%20FW:%20an%20ex-Yugoslavian's%20view%20of%20USA&In-Reply-To=&lt;90.1004542b.27b81279@aol.com&gt;">denis.bider@globera.com</a> writes:

in
<br>

<p><em>&gt;   &gt;  The third thing

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; speed one after another at equidistance in the same lane. The

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; baggy kakis and polo shirts. That is also re-enforced by their

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; better you are at being mediocre, the more succesfull you will be at

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; rackers. This is how the US preserves its cherished status-quo, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the rich can sleep soundly at night.
</em><br>
<p>This passage induced a pang of annoyance in me - it struck me as the 
<br>
traditional Bohemian condemnation of the &quot;bourgeois mentality,&quot; when in fact 
<br>
I think much of it stems from a lack of appreciation for what a high-trust 
<br>
civil society looks like when it's working. People wait patiently in line 
<br>
when they have an expectation that whatever service they're waiting for will 
<br>
be provided in a fair, efficient and timely manner.  People organize 
<br>
THEMSELVES into &quot;rows&quot; when they have an expectation that other people will 
<br>
not cut in line.  People voluntarily sort out their speed and spacing on the 
<br>
road when they believe, based on experience, that other drivers will do the 
<br>
same.
<br>
<p>Contrast this with what you see in classically low-trust groups that lack 
<br>
strong values of a civil society (adopting Fukuyama's terminology).  One sees 
<br>
pushing and shoving in lines, because individuals harbor a feeling that if 
<br>
they won't, others will cheat and take an unfair advantage of their patience. 
<br>
&nbsp;Lines don't form for access to scarce goods, because in such societies 
<br>
people believe that those ahead of them will be able to offer bribes or other 
<br>
covert favors to gain access.  And one need only try to drive in a city 
<br>
without a functioning civil society to quickly develop an appreciation for 
<br>
how spontaneous ORDER does NOT arise when people don't trust each other.  I 
<br>
leave coming up with examples of where one is likely to find such situations 
<br>
as an exercise for the reader.
<br>
<p>The question that arises for me is whether the second part of the passage 
<br>
quoted above contains an honest criticism of high-trust civil societies.  
<br>
Without a doubt, there is a high level of conformity in thought and behavior 
<br>
in the US and other such cultures.  Conformity to VALUES of respect for the 
<br>
autonomy of others is good, but reflexive conformity to IDEAS is inimical to 
<br>
the proper functioning of a free society.  The challenge, so far as I am 
<br>
concerned, is how to encourage the one without the other.  This is obviously 
<br>
possible in theory: &quot;Meta-values&quot; of tolerance and polite skepticism serve to 
<br>
curb the tendency that high-trust societies may have to fall into shallow 
<br>
channels of &quot;group-think&quot;.  In practice, this task is obviously difficult.  
<br>
We see in all high-trust societies (I'm thinking of the US, England, Germany, 
<br>
Scandinavia and Japan) a significant propensity for the great majority of 
<br>
people to accept a &quot;standard model&quot; of how their lives should be lived 
<br>
without any question or deep understanding of how that set of behaviors has 
<br>
come to be or why they might or might not be the best way they could live 
<br>
their lives. 
<br>
<p>The irony is that because high-trust cultures with functioning civil 
<br>
societies provide a comfortable basic level of &quot;social security&quot;, people who 
<br>
grow up in such cultures are more able to simply accept the status quo as a 
<br>
&quot;proper&quot; basis for life (to use that galling English adjective that sums up 
<br>
so many unquestioned assumptions) and never develop the habits of mind that 
<br>
come from deep questioning of the world around them.  This breeds complacency 
<br>
and, ultimately, a kind of chauvinism that is inimical to the very kinds of 
<br>
progress that made those societies possible in the first place.  More 
<br>
abstractly, there seems to be an inherent paradox in our current cultural 
<br>
scene, where healthy skepticism about social issues has led to the paralysis 
<br>
of post-modernist subjectivism, which is itself incompatible with many of the 
<br>
basic functions of trust and civility.  All of which has brought me over the 
<br>
years that I have considered these questions to the conclusion that only by 
<br>
returning to the root values of the Enlightenment can we balance both the 
<br>
good that comes from trust with the need for on-going skepticism.
