<em>&gt; Heh.  Seriously, people who have been using Oracle for years usually don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize just how much they don't know.  Most people consider me to be an
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; things about the product.  I don't know of any links to resources, but
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; of the third party books like O'Reilly's are good (avoid Oracle's books,
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; they are basically tree dumps of the online docs).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I did get myself a book on Oracle; it's pathetic. Any specific
<br>
recommendations?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To get the most out of the Oracle environment you need to know a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things.  Most importantly, you need to learn PL/SQL and learn it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.  PL/SQL is an Ada-like language (should be trivial for you, since
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; know Delphi), is very easy to learn for an experienced programmer, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives you all the procedural constructs you need.  However, it has some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quirks and oddities that nothing but experience will teach.  The O'Reilly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book (PL/SQL Programming) is the best reference on the language that I
</em><br>
know
<br>
<em>&gt; of.  The beauty of PL/SQL isn't that it is a wonderful language (it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- much too verbose), but that you can embed PL/SQL procedural blocks into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just about everything in Oracle.  You can mingle PL/SQL code with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SQL/commands/environment/etc in SQL*Plus (what you are looking for).  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can use PL/SQL to extend the SQL syntax (e.g. you can use custom
</em><br>
procedural
<br>
<em>&gt; logic in your WHERE clauses).  There are also a bunch of standard
</em><br>
libraries
<br>
<em>&gt; in PL/SQL that allow you to interact with various parts of the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (scheduling jobs, accessing files, etc).  Additionally, you can link
</em><br>
shared
<br>
<em>&gt; libraries into Oracle and map the call interfaces to PL/SQL to extend the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionality and effectively give an unlimited number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities.  And generally speaking, nothing runs faster for doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedural database logic, though it is dog slow for many other things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (like arithmetic).  The details of how to do all these things is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documentation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I didn't know I could mingle PL/SQL in with the regular stuff; I'll have to
<br>
work out how to do this, thanks.
<br>
<p>I must say that I suspected as much, but then found all these sites doing
<br>
bizarre stuff with SQL*PLUS and
<br>
thought it must be the only way (otherwise why on earth would you do these
<br>
things?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other thing you need to learn is SQL*Plus.  This is a pain, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.  PL/SQL lets you do what you want, but SQL*Plus sets up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment and controls the scripts.  But it isn't as important to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SQL*Plus very well as it is to learn PL/SQL very well; if you don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PL/SQL, you are missing out on a significant portion of the functionality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Oracle.  When everything is set up right and you know what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing, you end up with a relatively rich scripting environment that allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to build your own components and tools in a fashion similar to Unix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition.
</em><br>
<p>Cool. I'd prefer to concentrate on PL/SQL... something I've done a lot of is
<br>
TransactSQL for
<br>
SQLServer 6.5/7 (yes, please kill me now), an hideous language but stored
<br>
procedures is stored procedures; gotta have them. I'm very interested in
<br>
PL/SQL. However, because I'm writing code at the moment to target both SQL
<br>
Server and Oracle, so stored procs are basically out, as is anything beyond
<br>
fairly standard SQL (nonstandard as it is). But for scripting... sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;DBAs exist to keep developers from getting bored.&quot; - can I have this as
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;quote?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks. Nice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Do I remember that you do really scary code generation stuff? The memory
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;vague.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but my bread-n-butter is system and application architecture on big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oracle systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm mostly small systems myself. It's a surprisingly interesting world, but
<br>
has a lot more to do with budget and time constraints I think.
