<p>Thanks to Carol Tilley and Anders Sandberg for pointers on this topic. I've
<br>
now chased down a copy, and will quote Stewart Brand's thoughts on the
<br>
matter in a moment. Meanwhile, I found a vivid declaration by Danny Hillis,
<br>
the computer innovator who initiated the project:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.wirednews.com/wired/scenarios/clock.html">http://www.wirednews.com/wired/scenarios/clock.html</a>
<br>
<p>==========
<br>
<p>Some people say that they feel the future is slipping away from them.To me,
<br>
the future is a big tractor-trailer slamming on its brakes in front of me
<br>
just as I pull into its slip stream. I am about to crash into it. 
<br>
<p>When I was a kid, three decades ago, the future was a long way off - so was
<br>
the turn of the millennium. Dates like 1984 and 2001 were comfortably
<br>
remote. But the funny thing is, that in all these years, the future that
<br>
people think about has not moved past the millennium. It's as if the future
<br>
has been shrinking one year, per year, for my entire life. 2005 is still
<br>
too far away to plan for and 2030 is too far away to even think about. Why
<br>
bother making plans when everything will change? 
<br>
<p>How we name our years is part of the problem. Those three zeros in the
<br>
millennium form a convenient barrier, a reassuring boundary by which we can
<br>
hold on to the present and isolate ourselves from whatever comes next.
<br>
Still, there is more to this shortening of the future than dates. It feels
<br>
like something big is about to happen:
<br>
graphs show us the yearly growth of populations, atmospheric concentrations
<br>
of carbon dioxide, Net addresses, and Mbytes per dollar. They all soar up
<br>
to form an asymptote just beyond the turn of the century: The singularity.
<br>
The end of everything we know. The beginning of something we may never
<br>
understand. 
<br>
<p>====================
<br>
<p>Yet he then goes on immediately, with no further argument, to plan the
<br>
long-now clock. Oh.
<br>
<p>Mr Brand follows the same odd logic. He sees a tsunami on the way, but
<br>
explains, in effect, that he intends to 
<br>
sit it out. Oh.
<br>
<p>=====================
<br>
<p>Society itself could be dismembered, as some people ride the breaking wave
<br>
of ever newer technology over the event horizon into invisibility while
<br>
others lag behind, feeling the powerful gravitational force of
<br>
still-accelerating technology yet no longer able to see it. Thus the world
<br>
would be comprehensible only to those near the leading edges of technology.
<br>
<p>The Singularity is a frightening prospect for humanity. I assume that we
<br>
will somehow dodge it or finesse it in reality, and one way to do that is
<br>
to warn about it early and begin to build in correctives. (pp. 21-2)
<br>
<p>======================
<br>
<p>Somehow, I don't think he gets it.
<br>
<p>And yet, oddly enough, p. 22 reproduces the best graphical representation
<br>
of the Spike I've ever seen (but maybe I think that because it's very like
<br>
the one I independently drew during a couple of talks at a Foresight
<br>
gathering last year): a second order curve created by a sequence of
<br>
saturating curves, or waves, as each  technology starts, takes off, hits
<br>
its limits, saturates, then declines as its successor emerges powerfully.
<br>
The graph was prepared in 1994 by Tom McKendree, then at Hughes Aircraft,
<br>
for a discussion about future military contracting... McKendree is
<br>
currently doing very impressive work in his doctoral thesis on the impact
<br>
of molecular nanotechnology (of various grades of maturity from Simple
<br>
through Complex to Advanced) upon space exploration and exploitation.
