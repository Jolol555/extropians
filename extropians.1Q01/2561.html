<em>&gt; Subject: Things extropians agree on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a spirit of non-confrontational rationalism, I'd like to see if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can compose a list of ideas that we *ALL* agree on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you disagree with any of these memes, could you wave a hand and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Forcing our fellow human beings to live their lives as we see fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    is unethical. (Persuading them of the error of their ways so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    they _choose_ to live their lives by our lights is another matter.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Initiating violence against someone is wrong; self-defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is right.
</em><br>
<p>This is the standard libertarian propaganda.  While I agree with it in
<br>
principle, I strongly doubt that a truly libertarian or anarcho-capitalistic
<br>
&quot;government&quot; would be of any actual benefit for the majority of humanity.  I
<br>
don't think that we as a species are &quot;mature&quot; enough to deal with the amount
<br>
of responsibility that libertarianism requires - yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. The scientific method provides a better way of evaluating reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    than any religious dogma.
</em><br>
<p>I completely agree with this.  We can probably remove the word religious
<br>
though.  Any form of dogma, I think, is bad.  As far as religion goes, when
<br>
I speak about Extropianism or Nanotech or the singularity with people who
<br>
don't know much at all about those things, it comes out like some sort of
<br>
religious rant.  Is Extropianism a religion?  Just without dogma?  I dunno.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Progress (increases in human intelligence, longevity, wealth, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    happiness) is possible.
</em><br>
<p>I think we all see this every single day.  Not only is progress possible,
<br>
I'd say that it is inevitable over the long run.  Maybe that's not *as* easy
<br>
to agree on though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. Central control is usually less efficient than distributed control.
</em><br>
<p>This is kind of vague.  I sort of agree with it, but don't know if it holds
<br>
for all cases...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6. Empowering people to learn, work, and transcend their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    thing.
</em><br>
<p>As long as the act of Empowering is voluntary.  And as long as the
<br>
&quot;empowerment&quot; comes with no strings attached.  This is kind of sticky.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
