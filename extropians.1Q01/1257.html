<p>
Near the end of the last millenium, television was invented and
<br>
distributed to the masses. Over the course of the last century or so,
<br>
motion picture and video technology has gone from novelty to silent
<br>
movies to HDTV with six-channel audio output.
<br>
<p>About halfway through that, modern computers were invented.  Probably
<br>
among the first computer programs were recreations, or rather,
<br>
experiments.
<br>
<p>Video games or interactive video became available to consumers about 25
<br>
years ago.  The first video computer games, or video games, were for
<br>
example the paddle-based simple tennis game Pong and soon afterwards the
<br>
Atari computers.  These saw the explosion on the mid-80's of the use of
<br>
personal computers, where users could write their own game and many
<br>
seriously complex games were made.
<br>
<p>In the early 90's, console units like the Sega, Nintendo, and Sony
<br>
devices were intriduced, and since then many games are played on them.
<br>
In that time in the personal computer segment, the games went from those
<br>
like Tetris in the late 80's and early 90's to very sophisticated RPGs
<br>
and action soon later, and the first regular 3D games.
<br>
<p>Non-interactive video has for many years has seen the investment due it
<br>
as it's art.  As well, interactive video entertainment has seen more
<br>
recent influxes of basically the entertainment dollar.
<br>
<p>It's one thing to to note that many of today's video games for the
<br>
personal computer are violent or depict violence.  That's the market,
<br>
telling us that those are the titles that sell.  Perhaps that's because
<br>
the audience is mostly male.  For example, there are approx. 80,000
<br>
users of the Red Alert 2 online interactive game since it's introduction
<br>
two months ago who actually play the game against other live people over
<br>
the Internet..  It's a combat simulation game, a &quot;real-time strategy&quot;
<br>
game.  Currently, I actually play the game myself enough to have a rank
<br>
of about 400, as they keep a massive ladder of all the battles.  From
<br>
sampling conversation, I think most of the people that play are five
<br>
years younger than me, and some older and younger.
<br>
<p>So it got me thinking about video games and how much time and money I've
<br>
ever spent playing video games.  Here's one, what rewards are in video
<br>
games?  To some extent becoming skilled increases eye-hand (or
<br>
eye-mouse) coordination in action games, in logical games, logical
<br>
ability, and in repetitive games, regularity.  To a large extent
<br>
becoming skilled at playing video games allows you to play more video
<br>
games, that is true for most fields.
<br>
<p>In terms of software interface design, we could determine what the game
<br>
skills are, and then present complex interfaces to real world items in
<br>
terms of learned game metaphor.  For example, a manufacturing process
<br>
might be automated, but volatile.  In the event of the requirement of
<br>
human interaction, perhaps among the most efficient ways are these
<br>
learned video game behaviors.
<br>
<p>So I write about computer interactivity.
