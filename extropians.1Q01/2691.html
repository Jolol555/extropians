<p>I think laws generally tend to be too strict when they are difficult to
<br>
enforce, so that they are easier to enforce in those cases when they *can*
<br>
be enforced.
<br>
<p>Once technology develops to allow a law to be enforced more easily, the law
<br>
itself needs to be adapted. The assumption that something is difficult to
<br>
enforce is usually designed into laws, so when this assumption stops being
<br>
true, the law needs to evolve consistently - in the spirit of what the law
<br>
was originally meant to achieve, not in the spirit of what the letter of the
<br>
law currently says.
<br>
<p>I am looking forward towards a time when technology will enable us to limit
<br>
ourselves to good behavior by means of technology rather than by means of
<br>
law. However, I fear that some dumbsters in charge won't realize that
<br>
existing laws *do* need to be reconsidered and adapted once this takes
<br>
place. If they are not, this could easily lead to an Orvellian society.
