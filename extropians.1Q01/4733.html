<br>
<p>Sounds very like a replicator to me.

<p>Atom Optics Technologies Could Be Phenomenal, UA Theorist Says
<br>
<p>Feb 1, 2001     Lori Stiles
<br>
<p>Forty years after the invention of the laser, we carry around compact disk
<br>
audio players.
<br>
Twenty years after the advent of fiber optics, we connect on the Internet.
<br>
No one's sure yet where atom optics will lead -- but the possibilities
<br>
border on fantastical.
<br>
<p>Most of us think of optics as using matter in the form of mirrors and lenses
<br>
to direct and manipulate light. Atom optics reverses the roles of matter and
<br>
light - it uses laser light to direct and manipulate beams of atoms, or
<br>
&quot;matter waves.&quot;
<br>
<p>When in 1993 Pierre Meystre and his colleagues at the University of Arizona
<br>
predicted that it is possible to combine beams of atoms just as beams of
<br>
laser light are mixed to form a new laser light beam, &quot;it sounded crazy,&quot; he
<br>
admitted.

-------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Then in March 1999, Nobel Prize winner William D. Phillips and his group at
<br>
the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology
<br>
proved in experiments how it can be done. They coaxed ultracold atoms into
<br>
three separate waves analogous to laser-like light, then combined them to
<br>
create a new, fourth wave.
<br>
<p>It proved that &quot;nonlinear&quot; systems -- where system output is not
<br>
proportional to system input -- applies in atom optics,
<br>
<p>&quot;Suddenly, everything we predicted worked, which was amazing,&quot; Meystre said.
<br>
&quot;Funding for research on ultra cold atoms - which is what this is all
<br>
about - is just exploding.&quot;
<br>
<p>Meystre is Chair of Quantum Optics at the Optical Sciences Center, and
<br>
professor of optical sciences and professor of physics at UA. His
<br>
forthcoming book, &quot;Atom Optics,&quot; (Springer Verlag, 2001) will be the first
<br>
published on that subject.
<br>
<p>Louis-Victor, Prince de Broglie, first postulated the concept of atoms as
<br>
waves in 1924. Just as light behaves both as waves or particles (photons),
<br>
de Broglie posited, so matter must behave as particles (atoms) or waves
<br>
(matter waves, or de Broglie waves).
<br>
<p>This particle/wave duality may be one of the most &quot;unsettling&quot; aspects of
<br>
quantum mechanics, Meystre said in a lecture he gave in Germany as an
<br>
Alexander von Humboldt Prize winner in 1997.
<br>
<p>Only in the past decade have scientists been able to study the wave
<br>
properties of whole atoms in any detail. That's because atoms must be
<br>
chilled to almost absolute zero (zero Kelvin), where they are slowed almost
<br>
to a dead stop, before they clearly exhibit their wave-like nature.
<br>
<p>In the past five years scientists have discovered how with laser light to
<br>
cool atoms to one millionth of a degree Kelvin.
<br>
<p>That's about one billion times colder than room temperature and one million
<br>
times colder than interstellar space, Meystre noted.
<br>
<p>&quot;At these extreme temperatures, the world is an utterly strange place where
<br>
our everyday common sense is useless, quantum physics rules with its
<br>
counterintuitive laws, and atoms behave as waves,&quot; he said. &quot;At these
<br>
temperatures, the wavelength of atoms becomes as long or longer than visible
<br>
light wavelengths.&quot;
<br>
<p>Scientists already have demonstrated basic atom optical elements such as
<br>
atomic mirrors, atomic beam splitters and atomic gratings. They also have
<br>
developed crude atom lasers, a device that pulses individual atoms into a
<br>
coherent beam of atoms in a single quantum state. (All atoms in a single
<br>
quantum state execute the exact same motion.)
<br>
<p>Nonlinear atom optics breakthrough published in Nature, March 1999
<br>
<p>More practical atom lasers could lead to applications in precision
<br>
nanofabrication, atom holography, and &quot;undreamed of applications that will
<br>
come as surprises,&quot; Meystre predicts.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have this vision for atom optics, which is integrated atom optics --
<br>
atom optics on a chip,&quot; he said. &quot;One problem with current atom optics
<br>
experiments is that they are really quite big. They take up a couple of
<br>
tables in the laboratory. The big push is to do atom optics on the cheap, as
<br>
electronics is done on the cheap,&quot; by guiding atoms with magnetic and
<br>
electrical fields in something the size of an electronic chip.
<br>
<p>Atom holography is another stunning idea. Instead of making an image in
<br>
light as done in conventional holography, atom optics would make the
<br>
hologram of atoms.
<br>
<p>Atom holography would create actual replicas, rather than images of light.
<br>
<p>&quot;What this means is, we could make a real, 3-dimensional replica of some
<br>
object. We could copy objects.&quot; Meystre said.
<br>
<p>&quot;All of the individual steps to do this with nonlinear atom optics have been
<br>
demonstrated. It's just a matter of making it work all together. I think it
<br>
will happen in the next two or three years.&quot;
<br>
<p>Quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and atom lithography are other
<br>
possible technologies that depend on reaching a deeper theoretical
<br>
understanding of the fundamental physics that governs how ultracold atoms
<br>
behave.
<br>
<p>Extraordinary potential applications in atom optics are driven by
<br>
fundamental physics that is Meystre's research forte.
<br>
<p>The Army, the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation,
<br>
and, most recently, NASA have awarded Meystre and his colleagues hundreds of
<br>
thousands of dollars in new research money in the past year,
<br>
<p>The most major new grant, from the Department of Defense, established a
<br>
5-year, $5 million research consortium of Harvard, MIT, Stanford, UA and
<br>
Yale to develop novel high technology sensing devices that will make current
<br>
<p>state-of-the-art sensors used for strategic navigation, guidance, detection
<br>
and mapping obsolete.
<br>
<p>Meystre and UA optical sciences Professor Ewan Wright collaborate in the
<br>
consortium with other leading U.S. scientists who are pioneering atom
<br>
optics, including Stanford's Steven Chu, who won a1997 Nobel Prize for
<br>
developing techniques to cool and trap atoms with laser light.
<br>
<p>Future &quot;matter wave sensors&quot; could include a new class of compact atom-laser
<br>
gyroscopes at least a million times more sensitive than current laser
<br>
gyroscopes and ultra-sensitive gravity-measuring sensors for detecting
<br>
underground tunnels and chambers or undiscovered oil and mineral deposits.
<br>
<p>In his newest research project, funded weeks ago by the NASA Office of
<br>
Biological and Physical Research, Meystre will study how atom optics would
<br>
work in the microgravity of space.
<br>
<p>The ultracold atoms used in atom optics are so slow-moving that gravity
<br>
pulls them to Earth. Magnetism can be used to keep beams of atoms from
<br>
falling down, Meystre said, but magnetism and electrical fields change the
<br>
properties of the atoms and degrades the &quot;coherence,&quot; or you might say the
<br>
&quot;cleanness,&quot; of atom beams .
<br>
<p>Atom holography and atom lithography for nanoscale manufacturing (smaller
<br>
than a billionth of a meter) and inertial sensors that would be billions of
<br>
times more sensitive than counterpart optical devices for navigation,
<br>
tracking and guidances are examples of atom optics applications that would
<br>
best be done in microgravity.
