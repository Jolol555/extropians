<br>
<p><em>&gt; All you've described is an efficient market, not a living being.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you could say that, although an 'efficient market' is just a subset of
<br>
what I described.
<br>
<p>You are right to state that my speculations are based on a very loose
<br>
definition of what a 'living being' is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your definition of &quot;living thing&quot; is awfully loose.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could apply that definition to any number of mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devices that you would probably agree are not alive.
</em><br>
<p>But then, maybe I can ask you this: suppose we manage to produce an AI out
<br>
of silicon. How is that AI a living being?
<br>
<p>Suppose an AI appears out of a vast network of computers, as some people
<br>
speculate. Since each individual computer can easily 'survive' on its own,
<br>
how does that affect the whole network as a 'living being'?
<br>
<p>My speculations have a similar basis as the speculations that sentience may
<br>
arise out of a network of computers, only I am using a network of humans as
<br>
my underlying element. My claim is that, as the communications between the
<br>
nodes in the network become more efficient, the entire network takes on a
<br>
greater resemblance to living things. I also claim that this would
<br>
especially show when the network is challenged to respond to an external
<br>
event as a single, coordinated entity. Whereas at other times, when there is
<br>
no need to respond in coordinated manner, the network may show little
<br>
resemblance to a living thing. [One might then even say that it is 'asleep',
<br>
but I don't want to stretch you too far...]
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So then you agree that &quot;group entities&quot; of humans are built
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely on voluntary participation and are by no means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary for individual survival.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>They do seem to be necessary for what we consider comfortable survival,
<br>
though. A human being with no support from other human beings has a very
<br>
limited potential.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your &quot;society&quot; is an arbitrary application of grouping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is your metric for &quot;society&quot;?  If I can voluntary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; join or voluntarily leave a group, at what point am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designated &quot;a member of society&quot; regardless of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual disposition?
</em><br>
<p>This doesn't seem relevant to me - I think you're asking this because you're
<br>
limiting yourself to a stricter definition of what a 'living being' might be
<br>
than I do.
<br>
<p>Note also, I do not state that a 'group entity' is entirely a living being;
<br>
I'm only saying that group entities do sometimes (or often, depending on the
<br>
entity) resemble properties characteristical to living beings. Hence, such a
<br>
'group entity' might in a way be considered alive, although according to a
<br>
strict definition it is of course not.
<br>
<p>But then, how do I know whether you are alive or not? You might be just a
<br>
simulation. I only see text that appears as if it originated from an entity
<br>
named &quot;James Rogers&quot;. I have no reason to believe that you are actually
<br>
*alive*.
<br>
<p>You seem to be using the biological definition of 'living', which seems to
<br>
me irrelevant for this discussion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Many types of cells cannot survive on their own.  Ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can (or collections that can) are individual organisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two creatures living in symbiosis are not the same creature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A cell that can choose to disassociate itself from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism and survive is an individual organism in its own right.
</em><br>
<p>True, of course. Again, I am viewing the situation in a manner that seems
<br>
somewhat more relaxed than yours. If you want to operate with your strict
<br>
definition, you are of course correct.
<br>
<p>And somewhat limited by ordinary definitions, too.
