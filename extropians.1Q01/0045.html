<p>I prefer to think of it by reference to another Henkin, in the interesting
<br>
argument advanced by Aliza Berger, who noted his Gordian knot-cutting
<br>
interpretation:
<br>
<p>`I could carry around with me the responsum in the book &quot;Bne Banim&quot; by
<br>
Rabbi Henkin, which says that 
<br>
if only a few women are present, a mechitza isn't required.  By the same
<br>
token, a man entering the women's section once in a while is all right. But
<br>
I'd rather leave the room for many women to come -- by which time 
<br>
we'd need a mechitza.  Also, I'd rather not make a scene.  I just want to
<br>
pray.'
<br>
<p>Me too, sort of.
<br>
<p>One is reminded, after all, of Chaya Ochs's conundrum, here paraphrased by
<br>
Akiva Miller:
<br>
<p>1) A person who has absolutely no money does not have to sell his
<br>
possessions to get money for Shabbos candles.
<br>
<p>2) Even such a person must sell the shirt off his back to buy a single
<br>
Chanuka candle, which is the minimum with which to do the mitzva.
<br>
<p>3) A person who has only one candle on Erev Shabbos Chanuka must use it for
<br>
the mitzva of Shabbos candles, not the mitzva of Chanuka candles.
<br>
<p>4) It turns out that he sold his shirt to buy a Shabbos candle, which he
<br>
originally was not required to do. Was this required or not?
<br>
<p>These are deep issues we venture upon, not quite paradoxes, more indices of
<br>
the power of the intelligent human mind to tangle itself up to no useful
<br>
purpose. But enough of candles and shirts and interpenetration of loci,
<br>
pray unpack that alleged boxed meta-riddle so all may understand.
