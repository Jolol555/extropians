David Friedman is far too generous, as evidenced by the libertarian
<br>
socialists and anarchist mainstream dismissing his work out of hand,
<br>
especially his concepts of PPL, which they consider to be 'garbage'
<br>
although they consider it to be the best thing to come out of extropic
<br>
thought (which tells you what they think of the rest of our ideas).
<br>
<p>What we mean by a liberal society is not what they mean by a liberal
<br>
society. They, in fact, dismiss western liberalism as a failure. They
<br>
are stridently against capitalism, they almost uniformly say their prime
<br>
goal is to end capitalism of any kind, not just the mercantilist big
<br>
business that is created and protected by big government. They are
<br>
anti-property in a very Georgist fashion, and regard anything owned
<br>
beyond ones clothes, home, and tools, to be theft (and there is debate
<br>
over ownership of one's home). Land, they say, is not ownable by anyone
<br>
or group less than all the human race (and the cute and fuzzy animals
<br>
too) without infringing on the freedom of others to access the land.
<br>
<p>Based on this, they are most properly described as communists in sheeps
<br>
clothing. They are a new communism that has merged with the
<br>
environmental movement, which is rather incongruous to anyone who has
<br>
ever seen the environmental impact of communism wherever it has taken
<br>
root. They still do NOT get it about human nature, and they refuse to
<br>
admit that because their goals conflict with human nature so severely
<br>
that they must inflict tyranny to achieve them.

<em>&gt; &quot;They wished to preserve government health case and some other welfare
