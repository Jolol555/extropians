&quot;No, What Heston did was call Time-Warner on profiteering on Ice-T's
<br>
song. He called into question their ethics.
<br>
<p>How about this, what about the family of a slain police officer
<br>
suing Ice-T for instigating the killing?&quot;
<br>
<p>How about the families of the people that died in Tienamen square squashed 
<br>
by chinese tanks? What if they sue whoever came up with the idea for the 
<br>
protest?
<br>
<p>True, Time-Warner's interest might have been (better say plainly &quot;was&quot;) 
<br>
profit, but after all, they are there for that, aren't they? You are not 
<br>
expecting them to play the role of the good samaritan? That's  the 
<br>
government funding's job (at least in my country...).
<br>
<p>That is much the same question as violence in the media. Do you honestly 
<br>
think that by taking away all violent games and movies you will prevent 
<br>
violence from happening? They didn't have any violent movies or particularly 
<br>
violent games in the middle ages, and I believe books were mostly about 
<br>
romance and religion, and still they didn't look quite that pacific lot.
<br>
<p>Ice T might have provoked the policeman's death. But freedom of speech is 
<br>
not all about roses. Everything has a price. It doesn't matter how good your 
<br>
intentions are, there will always be people there to use the things you 
<br>
defend for purposes that are not nice. Corruption is everywhere... you won't 
<br>
get rid of it neither be censoring nor by giving freedom of speech. You just 
<br>
have to be careful in what things you sacrifice for what other things (I 
<br>
look like a priest speaking...)
