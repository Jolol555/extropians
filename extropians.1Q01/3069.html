<p>Thats a start.  Something as simple as dark sunglasses would
<br>
be better.  Those who say the software cannot be fooled by
<br>
dark sunglasses, well, I beg to differ.  Whatever face recognition
<br>
software that is in our own brains is somewhat thrown off by
<br>
sunglasses.  The old Groucho Marx glasses/nose combination
<br>
should do the trick.  Failing that, some kind of pliable silly putty
<br>
substance that can be stuck to the cheeks should throw off the
<br>
imager.  Pick an example from the silly walks department, and
<br>
there ya have it.
<br>
<p>Im not too worried about giving the government too much power
<br>
until they try to pass a law that it is illegal to go around walking
<br>
silly and wearing Groucho glasses.  This is the important point,
<br>
my friends, please note:  as these kinds of technologies develop,
<br>
it becomes ever more important to keep governments under
<br>
control.  Video the cops, watch carefully for whom you vote.
<br>
This is exactly what has caused me to go pi radians on transparency
<br>
issues: technology develops more quickly than peoples attitudes
<br>
change.  spike
