<em>&gt; 7 January 2001 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A medical school drop-out will unveil next month an invention which could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolutionise the mapping of the human genome and lead far more quickly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential cures for cancer, diabetes and other diseases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He has created a &quot;biochip&quot;, part cell and part microchip, by harnessing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;quantum physics with biology&quot;. The chip, Mr Densham will proclaim at its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch next month, can read genetic codes in a fraction of the time of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current mapping methods. 
</em><br>
<p>At first I thought this was that loony idea was saw here recently that
<br>
bio molecules as large as RNA could exist in a quantum superposition of
<br>
different states (so that a ribosome could hold several different amino
<br>
acids in superposition).  But I don't think this is related.
<br>
<p>It seems to be some mechanism to put the DNA onto a silicon chip and use
<br>
sensors to distinguish the nucleotides.  Maybe you would pre-coat the chip
<br>
with some chemicals that would be sensitive to the various bases and then
<br>
when you put the DNA in place you can detect changes in the electrical
<br>
distribution, or something like that.  It's not completely implausible
<br>
but I guess we will have to wait another month for the details.
