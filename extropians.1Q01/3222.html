<p>Anders' remarks and my earlier mention of the IBM 1620 console panel
<br>
featured in _Colossus: The Forbin Project_ have recalled to me two
<br>
other pretty faces from the early history of computers which were
<br>
featured in TV shows and movies of the 60's and 70's: the ElectroData
<br>
Datatron 205 (Burroughs B-205), and the SAGE maintenance console,
<br>
which I've taken the liberty to reminisce about.
<br>
<p>I've included links below to some Web sites containing interesting
<br>
historical trivia about computers and to others containing pictures of
<br>
some old machines.  I've also included links to some TV and movie
<br>
stills I captured myself from DVD and laserdisc.  My links are the
<br>
ones with &quot;fehlinger&quot; in them.  They're in pairs, with the ones having
<br>
&quot;_small&quot; in the name all being 300 pixels in width and having been
<br>
subjected to maximum JPEG compression; the companions of these are up
<br>
to 1200 pixels in width and JPEG-compressed at &quot;high&quot; quality,
<br>
according to Photoshop.  The sizes (in KBytes) are given next to the
<br>
links. My ISP provides very limited Web hosting for subscribers, and
<br>
it's not particularly speedy.  I've checked some of the big images by
<br>
accessing them from work (shocking waste of my employer's bandwidth!),
<br>
but was only able to get them more-or-less without trouble in the
<br>
evening; during the day, some of them only partially downloaded when
<br>
Explorer claimed &quot;Done&quot;, or stalled indefinitely (this may have been
<br>
bandwidth overload at my employer's end).  The small images should be
<br>
much easier to download, and are probably adequate for most people.
<br>
<p>Also, I haven't asked permission from the copyright owners to exhibit
<br>
any of the stills I made myself, so they could disappear at a moment's
<br>
notice if I or my ISP get a letter from a movie studio's legal
<br>
department, or if I exceed my allowable bandwidth for Web hosting (I
<br>
don't remember what it is, but it isn't much! -- if there's a surge in
<br>
demand, I'm sure they'll just assume I've posted porn pictures).  If
<br>
you've managed to download one of these into your browser, and you
<br>
think you might like to look at it again, it would probably be best to
<br>
save it on your local machine.  All the Irwin Allen stills I've
<br>
captured were taken from the recently-released Image Entertainment DVD
<br>
of the 1995 _The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen_, and are the property
<br>
of Twentieth Century Fox Television.

<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p>When the earliest generation of digital computers was reaching the end
<br>
of its useful life in the early 1960's, at least one Hollywood studio
<br>
(reputed to be Twentieth Century Fox :-&gt;) had the idea of salvaging
<br>
the most visually interesting pieces of these old dinosaurs for use as
<br>
props in movies and TV shows.  Producer Irwin Allen, schlockmeister of
<br>
the American sci-fi television shows of the 60's, caused two 50's
<br>
computers to become instantly recognizable to aficionados of 60's TV,
<br>
though only people with some knowledge of the folklore of those early
<br>
machines are likely to be able to actually identify them by name.
<br>
<p>THE DATATRON 205
<br>
<p>The first of these recycled gizmos to achieve iconic status was
<br>
committed to film in the original pilot of Allen's _Lost In Space_
<br>
television series (title: &quot;No Place To Hide&quot;).  Half a dozen of them
<br>
were visible during the course of this slow pan of the &quot;Alpha Control&quot;
<br>
mission control room:
<br>

<br>
The technician in this still is staring at the panel of blinking
<br>
lights as if it were a display terminal; at least these people would
<br>
not be tempted to waste their employers' time surfing the Web!  The
<br>
date in the storyline of this show is October, 1997.
<br>
<p>Three more of these devices were present throughout the TV series on
<br>
the flight deck of the &quot;Jupiter II&quot; spacecraft, on the ledge
<br>
underneath the panes of the ship's bay window (:-&gt;, the
<br>
&quot;navi-computers&quot;):

<br>
<p>Here's the story of these gadgets: In the mid-50's, there was a
<br>
computer manufacturer called the ElectroData Corporation, which was
<br>
spun off, according to various sources on the Web (see, for instance,
<br>
<a href="http://www.digiweb.com/~hansp/ccc/ccorgs.htm#Electrodata">http://www.digiweb.com/~hansp/ccc/ccorgs.htm#Electrodata</a> ), from the
<br>
Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation in 1954.  They were selling a
<br>
computer with vacuum tube circuitry and magnetic drum memory called
<br>
the Datatron 205, which became the Burroughs B-205 when ElectroData
<br>
was acquired by the Burroughs Corporation in 1956 (there was actually
<br>
a family of these machines, including the Datatron 204, 205, and 220).
<br>
<p>Many of the programmer/operator consoles of these machines were saved
<br>
from the scrap heap when they were decommissioned in the early 1960's,
<br>
on account of their visual appeal, and a lot of them ended up in Irwin
<br>
Allen's pilot for _Lost In Space_.  A testament to the iconic status
<br>
of these boxes is the fact that the Burroughs B-205 has its own fan
<br>
site on the Web! -- see <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/B205/index.html">http://www.angelfire.com/scifi/B205/index.html</a> .
<br>
As documented in pictures at this Web site, the B-205 console
<br>
appeared not only in _Lost In Space_ (1965-1968), but also as the
<br>
&quot;Bat-computer&quot; in the _Batman_ television series (1966-1968) and in
<br>
the movie _Fantastic Voyage_ (1966).  Not just the console, but an
<br>
entire B-205 mainframe appeared in the 1959 film _The Angry Red
<br>
Planet_ (which I have not seen).  This Web site also suggests the
<br>
existence of an active present-day market in the scavenging and
<br>
refurbishing of these units, as well as in the building and selling of
<br>
replicas (there's one replica listed here for sale at $3,000 -- I
<br>
don't know if the offer is current; you'll have to contact the
<br>
seller!).  Of course, the B-205 constitutes just one corner of the
<br>
subculture of vintage computer collecting.
<br>
<p>For the personal story of one obsessed fan's mania to acquire these
<br>
objects, see <a href="http://www.alphacontrol.com/whoarewe.htm">http://www.alphacontrol.com/whoarewe.htm</a> .  There are a
<br>
number of ironies in all this.  For one thing, the price of one of
<br>
these do-nothing 60 lb. boxes far exceeds that of a fully- functional
<br>
modern computer.  In addition, the really important functional
<br>
circuitry of the old computers was of no interest (at least not to
<br>
Hollywood or the fans) -- that is long gone, while only the consoles
<br>
(and a few tape drive units) remain.  Finally, while these B-205
<br>
consoles are the shells, at least, of what was once genuine computer
<br>
equipment, their depiction on the screen is distorted in several ways.
<br>
Their multiplicity often exceeds what would have been seen in a real
<br>
computer installation (only one console would have been needed by a
<br>
real computer, typically), in order to concentrate the visual
<br>
appeal. In other cases, a single console by itself is identified as
<br>
&quot;the computer&quot;.
<br>
<p>The original neon lamps in these consoles were replaced by bulbs
<br>
emitting a much brighter glow than would have been seen in real use,
<br>
in order to satisfy the needs of the camera and make the illumination
<br>
register on film.  These were driven by timing circuits which caused
<br>
the patterns of lights to change with a cycle time of anywhere from
<br>
about an eighth of a second to one second -- blinking faster, but
<br>
still slowly enough for the blinks to be discrete to the naked eye,
<br>
was usually meant to suggest to the viewer that the computer was
<br>
&quot;working harder&quot;.  In the real world, these boxes were debugging aids,
<br>
and the lights would have represented the contents of various
<br>
processor registers, so seeing them change so slowly would imply that
<br>
not much computing is getting done -- all very well and good if a
<br>
programmer were single-stepping the processor through a piece of code
<br>
in order to trace its execution.  However, in the science-fictional
<br>
milieus in which they are seen, such details are omitted, and the
<br>
functional significance of the light show is left to the viewer's
<br>
imagination.
<br>
<p>Still, there's an undeniably hypnotic quality to these blinking
<br>
lights.  Allen used a sort of blinking checkerboard to represent a
<br>
computer on the bridge of the submarine &quot;Seaview&quot; in another sci-fi
<br>
show from the same period, _Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea_ (1964-1968):
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/voyage_small.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/voyage_small.jpg</a> (14)
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/voyage.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/voyage.jpg</a> (210)
<br>
In retrospect, that prop bore a striking resemblance to a cellular
<br>
automaton of some sort, though the patterns were too regular and
<br>
repetitive to be very interesting.  Perhaps it was also meant to
<br>
suggest the pattern of punches on a Hollerith card, which would have
<br>
been familiar to most people by that time, and which would have
<br>
suggested &quot;computer&quot; even to the uninitiated.  A blinking checkerboard
<br>
or punched-card motif is also seen in the opening titles of the _Lost
<br>
In Space_ series.
<br>
<p>Not to put too fine a point on the matter, the aesthetic appeal of
<br>
these patterns of illuminated lightbulbs recalls a passage in Edelman
<br>
and Tononi's _A Universe of Consciousness_, in which the authors
<br>
describe bitmaps of a simulated visual cortex representing a healthy
<br>
adult brain contrasted with either 1.  an old, deteriorated cortex or
<br>
2. an immature cortex.  The pictures representing the healthy adult
<br>
cortex &quot;show continually changing patterned activity, corresponding to
<br>
both high (but less than case 1) entropy **and** high (but less than
<br>
case 2) functional integration, resulting in maximal complexity&quot;.
<br>
Apprehending such complexity, on some optimal boundary between order
<br>
and chaos, seems to engage the human aesthetic faculty.  It's a pity
<br>
that the dazzling complexity of modern computers is completely
<br>
concealed from view inside featureless boxes, and only the functional
<br>
results of the operations of these machines are considered pertinent
<br>
to human users.  It would be nice, just for the entertainment value,
<br>
to be able to open a window into a modern microprocessor's innards in
<br>
order to see some aesthetically-appealing representation of the
<br>
complex activity within.  I've always been a bit disappointed that my
<br>
own career as a computer programmer began well after the era of
<br>
blinkenlights was over!  Data storage media, as well, now bear their
<br>
contents invisibly, unlike punched cards or punched paper tape.
<br>
<p>The computer science department at the University of Virginia's School
<br>
of Engineering and Applied Science has a Web site devoted to computer
<br>
memorabilia from that university's own past at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/brochure/museum.html">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/brochure/museum.html</a> .  It turns out that
<br>
UVa's first computer (in 1960) was none other than a Burroughs B-205,
<br>
so Irwin Allen's classic prop can be seen in its native environment at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/brochure/new_images/b205.gif">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/brochure/new_images/b205.gif</a> .  This Web
<br>
site even has scans of the original Burroughs documentation for the
<br>
equipment; see, for instance, the &quot;Burroughs 205 Control Console and
<br>
Consolette Handbook&quot; (Bulletin 3027, printed May, 1956) at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/brochure/images/manuals/b205/console/console_1.html">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/brochure/images/manuals/b205/console/console_1.html</a>
<br>
(only selected pages are there, not the whole manual).  I had a book
<br>
when I was a kid (_The World of Science_ by Jane Werner Watson, Golden
<br>
Press, 1958) that had a photo of this machine, and I also remember
<br>
seeing one in a Burroughs ad in a late-50's issue of _Scientific
<br>
American_.
<br>
<p>There is a Web site called &quot;Ed Thelen's Nike Missile Web Site&quot;
<br>
( <a href="http://ed-thelen.org">http://ed-thelen.org</a> ) which also contains the germ of a site that
<br>
will be an on-line accompaniment to the spin-off of the Boston
<br>
Computer Museum that was established last year at the NASA Ames
<br>
Research Center in Mountain View, California (see
<br>
<a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/cmhc-history.html">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/cmhc-history.html</a> ).  The page at
<br>
<a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist</a> has a large collection (mostly
<br>
uncatalogued and unlabelled) of monochrome photos of vintage computer
<br>
installations in their heyday.  Some of these are of Burroughs B-204
<br>
and B-205 machines, for example:

<p>SAGE
<br>
<p>A second collection of recycled gear utilized by Irwin Allen on TV and
<br>
in the movies is considerably more imposing than the Burroughs console
<br>
from _Lost In Space_.  It can be seen here in the background behind
<br>
Robert Colbert and Lee Meriwether in a still from the television
<br>
series _The Time Tunnel_ (1966-1967):

<br>
If the following Usenet post is true, this item also appeared as late as
<br>
1996 as set dressing on an ABC News television broadcast: see
<br>
<a href="http://neil.franklin.ch/Usenet/alt.folklore.computers/19980113_SAGE">http://neil.franklin.ch/Usenet/alt.folklore.computers/19980113_SAGE</a>
<br>
(search down the page for &quot;ABC&quot;).
<br>
<p>In the early Cold War days, the U. S. government funded the design and
<br>
manufacture of an enormously ambitious and expensive computer system
<br>
that was to automate the identification and tracking of potentially
<br>
hostile aircraft penetrating North American continental airspace.
<br>
This was the notorious SAGE system (Semi-Automatic Ground
<br>
Environment).  The hardware design was begun in 1951 as Project
<br>
Whirlwind at MIT's Lincoln Lab, and production machines were
<br>
manufactured by IBM as the AN/FSQ7 computer.  Each of these machines
<br>
(comprising a pair of CPUs) used 60,000 vacuum tubes (and a few
<br>
thousand transistors as well), weighed 250 tons, and consumed 3
<br>
megawatts of power (enough for an entire suburban development, but a
<br>
SAGE installation had its own generators).  A network of 23 SAGE
<br>
&quot;Direction Centers&quot; was eventually deployed, the first coming on-line
<br>
in 1956 and the last in 1962.  The last remaining SAGE Direction
<br>
Center (a Canadian installation) was decommissioned in 1983.  When
<br>
this system was first envisioned, the main threat to U. S. security
<br>
was perceived to be long-range bombers carrying hydrogen bombs, as
<br>
depicted in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 movie _Dr.  Strangelove_.  There is
<br>
an article entitled &quot;Dr. Strangelove Meets IBM: The SAGE System&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://www.ddj.com/articles/2000/0085/0085a/0085a.htm">http://www.ddj.com/articles/2000/0085/0085a/0085a.htm</a> (see also &quot;The
<br>
SAGE Site&quot; at <a href="http://www.togger.com/_main_page.shtml">http://www.togger.com/_main_page.shtml</a> and Ed Thelen's
<br>
article at <a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/sage.html">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/sage.html</a> ) By the time the
<br>
system was complete in 1962, it was already effectively obsolete, and
<br>
the state of the art in weapons delivery had shifted to the
<br>
inter-continental ballistic missile, which SAGE was too slow to be of
<br>
any use against.
<br>
<p>Some commentators laud SAGE for being a nursery of many useful
<br>
technologies, while others decry it as being the first spectacular
<br>
computer boondoggle.  In any case, Hollywood made the best of things
<br>
by acquiring retired SAGE equipment for use as high-tech props in
<br>
movies and TV shows.  In particular, the AN/FSQ7 Maintenance Console,
<br>
a sloping person-high bank of lights, knobs, and switches (a real
<br>
AN/FSQ7 installation sported a pair these, one for each of the
<br>
duplexed CPUs), made its screen debut on Irwin Allen's _The Time
<br>
Tunnel_ in 1966:

<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/tunnel_1.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/tunnel_1.jpg</a> (240).
<br>
This formed part of a larger set design obviously heavily
<br>
influenced by the decade-older _Forbidden Planet_:

<br>
<p>The SAGE console in _The Time Tunnel_ was flanked at either end by an
<br>
ASR-33 teletype, and some Burroughs tape drives:

<br>
As noted in the alt.folklore.computers Usenet thread mentioned above (the
<br>
URL, once again, is
<br>
<a href="http://neil.franklin.ch/Usenet/alt.folklore.computers/19980113_SAGE">http://neil.franklin.ch/Usenet/alt.folklore.computers/19980113_SAGE</a> ),
<br>
the big monitor displaying Lissajous figures was probably not part of
<br>
the original SAGE installation (:-&gt;):
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/tunnel5_small.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/tunnel5_small.jpg</a> (14)

<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/tunnel5.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/tunnel5.jpg</a> (235).
<br>
<p>Not surprisingly, a section of a SAGE console also eventually appeared
<br>
on the bridge of the Seaview, along the wall -- er, bulkhead to the
<br>
left of the blinking checkerboard, IIRC (not visible in the still
<br>
above, but see <a href="http://www.iann.net/voyage/manbeast/pages/voya038.html">http://www.iann.net/voyage/manbeast/pages/voya038.html</a> ).
<br>
Some individual panels from SAGE consoles are also visible at the
<br>
sides of the radar screens in the Jupiter II still above.
<br>
<p>There are photos of a real AN/FSQ7 SAGE installation at &quot;The SAGE Site
<br>
Photo Page&quot;, <a href="http://www.togger.com/photos/_photos.shtml">http://www.togger.com/photos/_photos.shtml</a> and also at
<br>
<a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-sage-a.jpg">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-sage-a.jpg</a> .  As with the B-205
<br>
consoles, the SAGE maintenance console was represented on screen as
<br>
&quot;the computer&quot;, whereas in real life the AN/FSQ7 CPUs were housed in a
<br>
different room from that containing the maintenance consoles and the
<br>
aircraft tracking displays (a wonderful bit of trivia: the tracking
<br>
displays had built-in cigarette lighters and ashtrays for the
<br>
convenience of the SAGE operators.  Later it was noticed that airborne
<br>
particulates were gumming up the magnetic drum memory units, after
<br>
which smoking was banned in these installations).
<br>
<p>At a time when few members of the general public would have had the
<br>
opportunity to interact with or even see a computer personally, Irwin
<br>
Allen's television shows established visual tropes for the computer
<br>
that made a lasting impression on the viewers of those programs.
<br>
Using decommissioned gear saved him money while providing him with
<br>
complex, attractive props (even as mere exteriors, they had been
<br>
designed by their manufacturers for a purpose, and Allen didn't have
<br>
to repeat the labor and expense of that design) that bore up well even
<br>
to closeup shots.  However, this equipment was already anywhere from 5
<br>
to 10 years out-of-date when it first appeared on TV, and whatever
<br>
window of plausibility existed for these props representing computer
<br>
hardware of the future closed abruptly with the 1968 release of
<br>
Kubrick's _2001_.  Nevertheless, both the Datatron and the SAGE props
<br>
retain their technophilic aesthetic appeal to this day; they were
<br>
cannily chosen in that regard.  Also, they clearly had a heavy
<br>
influence on the &quot;in-house&quot; prop and set designs developed by art
<br>
director Walter M. (&quot;Matt&quot;) Jefferies for the original _Star Trek_
<br>
television series.
<br>
<p>A final bit of computer trivia from the _Lost in Space_ pilot: the
<br>
prop seen in the foreground in
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/alpha2_small.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/alpha2_small.jpg</a> (15)
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/alpha2.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/alpha2.jpg</a> (161)
<br>
and in closeup in

<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/alpha3.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/alpha3.jpg</a> (183)
<br>
looks to me very much like a reworked Burroughs B-220 console; compare:
<br>

<br>
prop was also used in the late-60's pilots for two never-to-be-made TV
<br>
shows called _City Beneath The Sea_ and _The Man From The Twenty-Fifth
<br>
Century_:

<br>
SAGE equipment also appeared in both these pilots:
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/25th_2_small.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/25th_2_small.jpg</a> (12)

<br>
<p>When Irwin Allen gave up producing, umm, unchallenging sci-fi for TV
<br>
mass audiences in the 60's to take up the disaster-movie genre in the
<br>
70's (see <a href="http://www.iann.net/irwinallen/iaprofil.htm">http://www.iann.net/irwinallen/iaprofil.htm</a> ), the SAGE
<br>
maintenance console went with him, to appear in _The Towering Inferno_
<br>
(1974) as the building security computer of the ill-fated skyscraper.
<br>
As a conventionalized representation of a contemporary (rather than
<br>
futuristic) computer, the brief glimpse we have of this prop does not
<br>
detract unduly from the overall credibility of the film; nevertheless,
<br>
we are seeing equipment from the vacuum-tube era in a movie that was
<br>
released at the beginning of the microprocessor age -- a bit of a
<br>
generation gap.  In the following still,
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/inferno1_small.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/inferno1_small.jpg</a> (11)
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/inferno1.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/inferno1.jpg</a> (178),
<br>
the small device at the end of the red-painted console next to
<br>
which O. J. Simpson is standing looks very much like the keyboard from
<br>
an IBM keypunch (for example, the Model 029:
<br>
<a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~jimw/ibm029~3.jpg">http://www.rdrop.com/~jimw/ibm029~3.jpg</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~jimw/ibm029~1.jpg">http://www.rdrop.com/~jimw/ibm029~1.jpg</a> ).
<br>
<p>Here's another view of the security room from _The Towering Inferno_,
<br>
showing the panels from the SAGE maintenance console.  The IBM
<br>
cathode-ray tube display visible in this still is a very up-to-date
<br>
mid-70's terminal found in contemporary System/370 computer
<br>
installations of that period (compare
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/events/anniversaries/40th/images/ibm370_1682/20.html">http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/events/anniversaries/40th/images/ibm370_1682/20.html</a>
<br>
and <a href="http://www.obsoletecomputermuseum.org/ibm3275.html">http://www.obsoletecomputermuseum.org/ibm3275.html</a> ), making its
<br>
juxtaposition with the SAGE equipment a glaring anachronism.  It was
<br>
the advent of CRT console displays like these that brought the
<br>
blinkenlights era to a close in the 70's by making front-panel
<br>
register lights superfluous.  There is also a pair of tape drives
<br>
(Burroughs, if I'm not mistaken) visible in the still below (what
<br>
would a computer be without tape drives? what's a disk drive? :-&gt;):
<br>

<br>
<p>The SAGE equipment got its most intimate portrayal on film
<br>
(appropriately enough) in the 1972 Woody Allen comedy _Everything You
<br>
Always Wanted To Know About Sex* (*but were afraid to ask)_.  In the
<br>
final segment of this movie, titled (the prudish should avert their
<br>
eyes) &quot;what happens during ejaculation?&quot;, the SAGE console adds visual
<br>
spice to the &quot;Brain Room&quot; presided over by Tony Randall and around a
<br>
dozen more white-coated technicians (including a gum-chewing Burt
<br>
Reynolds):
<br>

<br>
This segment, by the way, provides one of the best illustrations I know
<br>
of the fallacy of the homunculus, familiar to philosophers of consciousness
<br>
(two others being the animated brain homunculi depicted in the old Bell
<br>
Science films _Gateway to the Mind_ and _Hemo the Magnificent_).

<br>
<p>A positive visual match between these movie shots and photos available
<br>
on the Web of a real SAGE installation is difficult to establish, but
<br>
compare the color photo at the bottom left of the page
<br>
<a href="http://www.togger.com/photos/_photos.shtml">http://www.togger.com/photos/_photos.shtml</a> with the following still:

<br>
<p>Since a SAGE installation consumed 3 megawatts of electricity, it's
<br>
not surprising that much of the instrumentation should be devoted to
<br>
monitoring the health of the power supply (a necessity for all
<br>
machines of the vacuum-tube era, in addition to controls for
<br>
monitoring and diagnosing the health of the vacuum tubes themselves):

<p>Metal-edged control keys and indicator lights such as these were
<br>
typical of IBM equipment in the 50's and early 60's:

<a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-0550.jpg">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-0550.jpg</a> .  The System/360,
<br>
introduced in 1964, sported a new and different look -- see, for
<br>
example <a href="http://www.nfrpartners.com/comphistory/hdcmod30d.htm">http://www.nfrpartners.com/comphistory/hdcmod30d.htm</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://www.nfrpartners.com/comphistory/hnbmod30.htm">http://www.nfrpartners.com/comphistory/hnbmod30.htm</a> ).
<br>
<p>The SAGE prop also appeared in Woody Allen's 1973 _Sleeper_.  In the
<br>
following still, the Woody Allen character Miles Monroe, disguised as
<br>
a robot, is chased around the Domesticon repair facility by security
<br>
guards while SAGE blinks in the background:

<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/sleeper.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/sleeper.jpg</a> (132).
<br>
The question of plausibility doesn't really arise with the Woody Allen
<br>
movies, since they are in any case intended as over-the-top parodies
<br>
of the sci-fi genre.  Nevertheless, it must have been a source of
<br>
hilarity to the personnel operating the remaining SAGE Direction
<br>
Centers to see this familiar equipment in the TV and movie settings in
<br>
which it was placed by Irwin Allen and Woody Allen.
<br>
<p>The total amount of money spent on the SAGE project remains classified
<br>
to this day, but has been estimated at eight to twelve billion 1964
<br>
dollars (according to
<br>
<a href="http://www.ddj.com/articles/2000/0085/0085a/0085a.htm">http://www.ddj.com/articles/2000/0085/0085a/0085a.htm</a> ).  SAGE
<br>
skeptics claim that the primary usefulness of this expenditure was to
<br>
impress VIPs (according to <a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/sage.html">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/sage.html</a> ).
<br>
To this must be added the construction of very entertaining and
<br>
memorable computer props for the television and movie industry :-&gt;.
<br>
Perhaps the final humiliation for remaining bits of the SAGE prop
<br>
occurred in the 1995 documentary film _The Fantasy Worlds of
<br>
Irwin_Allen_:

<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p>Some other memorable appearances of real computer equipment in the
<br>
movies include Stanley Kubrick's 1964 _Dr. Strangelove_, which
<br>
contains a shot of an Air Force IBM mainframe installation containing
<br>
genuine contemporary hardware in a realistic setting:

<br>
It's difficult to read the model number in this still, but
<br>
according to <a href="http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1961.htm">http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1961.htm</a> this is likely an
<br>
IBM 7040 or 7044 being used as an I/O processor handling card readers
<br>
and printers for a faster 7090 or 7094 system.
<br>
<p>The 1975 Sydney Pollack film _Three Days of the Condor_ features a
<br>
genuine Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 minicomputer in a not very
<br>
realistic setting:
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/condor_small.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/condor_small.jpg</a> (10)
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/condor.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/blinkenlights/condor.jpg</a> (118).
<br>
In this still, the device to the right of the computer (that looks like
<br>
an overhead projector) is an automatic page-turning flatbed scanner (I
<br>
suppose it might be an example of early Kurzweil equipment, but I
<br>
haven't been able to find any confirmation of this).  In the film, the
<br>
system is shown scanning far-East journals in an ideographic language,
<br>
while the computer prints out a side-by-side version in transliterated
<br>
Roman characters and translated English.  Pretty impressive for a
<br>
PDP-8!  Later in the film, the computer has apparently been halted in
<br>
mid-program; the assassin Joubert (played by Max von Sydow) causes the
<br>
Decwriter to resume printing by flipping the Run/Halt switch on the
<br>
front panel.  Not exactly standard operating procedure for a real
<br>
system.  There is a Web site called &quot;Jim's Computer Garage/Museum&quot;
<br>
(different Jim) which contains some excellent color photos of various
<br>
DEC minicomputers at <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~jimw/jcgm-min.shtml#Minis">http://www.rdrop.com/~jimw/jcgm-min.shtml#Minis</a> .
<br>
<em>&gt;From these photos, it is possible to identify the _Condor_ computer as
</em><br>
a PDP-8/e.
<br>
<p>George Lucas' 1970 _THX 1138_ contains these shots of a rather large
<br>
System/360 installation (I count four CPU consoles):

This is a contemporary 1970 computer installation, though the film is
<br>
supposedly set in the 25th Century (according to the laserdisc jacket;
<br>
I can't recall anyone in the film actually identifying the year).
<br>
There are other high-tech-looking venues used during the shooting of
<br>
this film, including the control room of what appears to be a railroad
<br>
or subway system (probably the BART system in San Francisco, whose
<br>
futuristic-looking trains also appear in the movie).  IMO, the look of
<br>
this film remains compelling despite the anachronistic technology
<br>
(which includes close-up shots of Fortran code being spit out by a
<br>
lineprinter; yes, it's something of an anti-technology rant, but it's
<br>
an entertaining one).
<br>
<p>According to the Jargon File entry at
<br>
<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/blinkenlights.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/blinkenlights.html</a> ,
<br>
&quot;blinkenlights&quot; made something of a comeback in the real world in the
<br>
80's and 90's, though they no longer represent processor registers;
<br>
most often, they comprise the twinkling red and green status LEDs on
<br>
network equipment (unfortunately, where I work, the light show is kept
<br>
out of sight in a locked closet).  Daniel Hillis' Connection Machine,
<br>
manufactured by Thinking Machines, Inc., came in for some mockery as a
<br>
result of the marketing decision made by that manufacturer to
<br>
incorporate a spectacular LED display representing the status of
<br>
individual processors in this massively parallel, multiprocessor
<br>
machine (see <a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/example-tour.html">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/example-tour.html</a> ; click
<br>
on &quot;Connection Machines&quot;).  The following quotation from TMI
<br>
literature appears in many locations on the Web as a piece of humor:
<br>
&quot;One of the most attractive features of a Connection Machine is the
<br>
array of blinking lights on the faces of its cabinet.&quot; -- CM Paris
<br>
Ref. Manual, v6.0, p48.  There is also a bit of gossip at the Ed
<br>
Thelen site (link just above) to the effect that the CM-5 had a
<br>
&quot;customer switch&quot; that would make the machine blink its LEDs to make
<br>
it look like it was working even when it wasn't doing anything useful.
<br>
In spite of the mockery this machine suffered on account of its
<br>
blinkenlights, I can think of no other real-world machine that
<br>
**looks** as much as though it ought to be hosting an AI:

<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/MetaComp/Images/CM5_lg.jpg">http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/MetaComp/Images/CM5_lg.jpg</a> I'm not
<br>
aware of any movie that used one of these as a prop, unfortunately.
<br>
<p>One last remark.  The fondness that some people have for dinosaurs
<br>
from the blinkenlights era is proved by the lengths to which a group
<br>
of enthusiasts have gone to restore one of these old machines -- none
<br>
other than an IBM 1620.  (see
<br>
<a href="http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/example-tour.html">http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/example-tour.html</a> ; click on &quot;IBM 1620,
<br>
Restored&quot;).  &quot;So everything we did is in red wires here, and the
<br>
problem was that this core memory in here disintegrated - it was 40
<br>
years old. So we designed and built a semiconductor replacement, that
<br>
you can see right here - and wired it in...  Just about a month ago
<br>
[March 2000] ran the level zero diagnostic which means everything is
<br>
working on this - after 40 years.&quot;  I'm sure there were tears in the
<br>
eyes of the old-timers when that moment arrived!  See also the &quot;IBM
<br>
1620 Restoration Mailing List Archive&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://hissa.nist.gov/mlists/ibm1620/">http://hissa.nist.gov/mlists/ibm1620/</a> and the Java simulator (this is
<br>
too cool!) at <a href="http://www.jowsey.com/java/sim1620/">http://www.jowsey.com/java/sim1620/</a> .
<br>
<p>Cheers.
