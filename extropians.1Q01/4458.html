<em>&gt; &gt;Maybe it's just me, but maybe not.  Didn't Mr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heston
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on the one hand condemn the stifling of freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;speech on campus and on the other BRAG about his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in stifling Ice-T's freedom of speech?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, What Heston did was call Time-Warner on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profiteering on Ice-T's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; song. He called into question their ethics.
</em><br>
<p>That's a way of looking at it, I suppose... but it
<br>
misses by quite a bit in my opinion.  What do YOU
<br>
think he was doing when &quot;He called into question their
<br>
ethics&quot; other than using the same tired old PC
<br>
tactics?  The very tactics his rant (excuse me...
<br>
speech) was attacking.  That's how PCness works,
<br>
through &quot;moral&quot; suasion and public approbation.
<br>
<p>Let's say an artist sings a song about Christ engaging
<br>
in oral sex with Mary Magdalene.  Or another sings a
<br>
song about smoking pot... or about dismembering
<br>
kittens, or shooting queers or establishing the gold
<br>
standard or taking away guns or giving guns away free
<br>
or or or....
<br>
<p>Even if those songs are commercially profitable, they
<br>
shouldn't be produced because some people find them
<br>
offensive?  And that would make the record companies
<br>
that did produce such songs unethical?
<br>
<p>By that standard, record companies probably shouldn't
<br>
produce anything except innocuous bubble gum love
<br>
songs, 'cause someone is gonna be offended no matter
<br>
what.
<br>
<p>The record company is ethical if and only if they
<br>
produce and promote records that sell and don't
<br>
produce or promote records that don't sell.  It is
<br>
UNETHICAL for them to NOT provide their stockholders
<br>
with a profit or their customers with a wanted product
<br>
simply because the content makes them uncomfortable.
<br>
<p>&quot;Cop Killer&quot; was a commercial success.
<br>
<p>I don't condone the sentiments expressed in that song,
<br>
but the record company wasn't unethical in the least
<br>
to produce it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about this, what about the family of a slain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police officer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suing Ice-T for instigating the killing?
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like anti black PC speak rather than pro black
<br>
PC speak.  Let them sue the manufacture and seller of
<br>
the gun used too...  And let them sue the NRA as well
<br>
for promoting the individual ownership of guns.
<br>
<p>Or how about we act like sane people and do none of
<br>
them?
<br>
<p>&quot;Songs don't kill cops, people kill cops.&quot;
<br>
<p>It's very PC to speak out against violence in
<br>
entertainment... and this is where I see Heston as a
<br>
hypocrite.  He condemns one form of &quot;thought control&quot;
<br>
and engages in another.
<br>
<p>He isn't really pro liberty... else he'd take the bad
<br>
with the good.  He just wants to draw the restrictions
<br>
in different places than they are currently drawn. 
<br>
And he acts out his desires in real life.  That's
<br>
scary.
<br>
<p>Am I the only one on this list that sees things this
<br>
way?
<br>
