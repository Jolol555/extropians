<p>Actually John, we discussed this about a year ago, but I have
<br>
enough new information to drop another post.  I have been
<br>
lurking on a couple of chat groups for persons with growth
<br>
disorders, but have not yet gotten up the guts to post anything,
<br>
and I am not guaranteeing that I will ever do so.  Dont know what
<br>
I would say:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi!  Im a six foot rocket scientist interested in recruiting a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;female from among you for a one way trip to Mars.  How
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much do you weigh?  How much do you eat?  How much
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do you *really* like this planet?
<br>
<p>I dont think so.  But I have learned some possibly useful
<br>
information.  As it turns out, humans do not scale linearly
<br>
with weight.  If all of my dimensions were cut in half, my
<br>
height would be 3 ft, my surface area would be a quarter
<br>
its current value and my weight one eighth.  So, 15 pounds,
<br>
rocket scientist's dream, lets fly.
<br>
<p>But as we said, humans do not scale linearly down.  Verne Troyer,
<br>
the actor that played MiniMe in Austin Powers, is 2 ft 8 inches
<br>
but weighs almost 70 pounds.  I may tell later how I found this
<br>
out, but the fact is, for a Mars mission, this may not matter
<br>
very much.  It matters little what one weighs, but it matters
<br>
greatly how much one eats, for this is a weight penalty that
<br>
must be paid over and over.
<br>
<p>More on that later.  Regarding pygmies, it is much more
<br>
difficult to find info on this than on dwarfism, for there are
<br>
very few pygmies online and no chat groups for pygmies
<br>
that I have been able to find.  I do not consider pygmies
<br>
ideal candidates for Mars missions for altho they tend to
<br>
be much smaller than most humans, there are language
<br>
barriers.  The !xhosa language has not been fully or
<br>
universally encoded into written form, and we are a
<br>
long way from having machines that could recognize
<br>
and translate it.  Some insight into pygmies may be gained
<br>
from viewing the movie &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; which
<br>
starred a pygmy actor whose dimensions were about 5
<br>
ft and approximately 90 pounds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also--you have to feed and air-supply
</em><br>
<p>Air supply is not such a pressing problem, as oxygen can be
<br>
regenerated from carbon dioxide, given sufficient energy.
<br>
Water too can be recycled, given an energy supply.
<br>
Of course, the energy needed is proportional to the size of
<br>
the crew.  The feed problem: also proportional to the crew
<br>
size.
<br>
<p>Before my next post in a week or so, be thinking this over:
<br>
What aspects of the mission scale linearly with the crew size?
<br>
What aspects scale as the square?  What scales as the cube?
<br>
I may prepare a full paper on this topic for the engineering
<br>
society to which I belong, the Society of Aerospace Weight
<br>
Engineers.  spike
