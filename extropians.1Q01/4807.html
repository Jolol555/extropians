<p>&nbsp;I am involved in a nanotech startup whose goals are about as Drexlerian
<br>
as Zyvex's. We're not seeking much publicity yet.
<br>
&nbsp;We are currently seeking funding from VCs. Small investors should not
<br>
expect to be welcome - the SEC seems to be rather effective at &quot;protecting&quot;
<br>
them from risky investments, and the legal system also creates costs which
<br>
make small investors less attractive to privately held companies.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The Foresight Institute has talked about someone setting up some sort of
<br>
fund to allow small investors to invest in nanotech. It's unclear to me
<br>
whether anyone is actively working on it. It may well have been abandoned
<br>
due to inadequate interest.
