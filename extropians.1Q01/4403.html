<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>Back in December, I began a thread entitled &quot;Dyson sphere stability&quot;.  (I
<br>
just tried to find it, and the rest of the posts in the thread, so I could
<br>
include direct links, but the 4th quarter 2000 posts are not yet accessible
<br>
in the archives.)  I liked the elegance of the Dyson shell, and sought to
<br>
rescue it from predictions of unworkability.
<br>
<p>At the time, Eugene gave a lengthy response, the relevant bits of which,
<br>
from my own email archive, I cut and paste below.
<br>
<p>One of the problems is the structural stability of the shell.  Gravity from
<br>
the enclosed star is pulling on it tending to make it collapse.  Someone
<br>
has run some numbers that predict compressive stresses in excess of the
<br>
strengths of available construction materials. Thus Gene's use below of the
<br>
term 'Unobtainium'.  
<br>
<p>Gene said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even if you could construct it, what about self gravitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(collapse is autocatalytic)...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;... you can't build a sphere of any relevant size
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without infinitely strong material (Unobtainium still isn't in the PSE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last time I looked). 
</em><br>
<p>Now, you can spin the sphere, and thereby counter the gravitational forces
<br>
in the equatorial region, but the caps of the sphere, the portions in the
<br>
high lattitudes north and south, bear down in compression on the equatorial
<br>
region.  
<br>
<p>This is the problem, those end caps bearing down, too heavy for any known
<br>
structural material to support.
<br>
<p>Now hold that thought.
<br>
<p>Further on in the discussion Gene addressed a point I was interested in.
<br>
The shell completely encloses the  star, intercepting the entire radiated
<br>
output.  Absorbtion, reflection, secondary absorbtion and reflection, by
<br>
both the shell and the star, and finally transmission through the shell,
<br>
and radiation from the exterior of the shell, constitutes a whole new
<br>
regime of energy transmission compared to the old star-and-planets model.
<br>
What will the equilibrium situation look like when it all settles down?
<br>
Gene weighs in on this and says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Have you considered that you're heating the star up, by reflecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bulk of radiation back in in form of shortwave photons? (Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making the orbiting objects as black as possible). Whatever the star
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is going to do, this is not going to be sustainable. You're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heat the star, which will bloat and emit bluer and bluer. You'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely can boost mass loss that way, by making the surface hotter.
</em><br>
<p>Ok.  So, without going too deeply into the machinations of the unconscious
<br>
mind, I find myself tootlin' along some months later when--blink!--on goes
<br>
the little light.  Perhaps it was Robert Bradbury's piece on 
<br>
&quot;Planet Disassembly&quot;, where he says, in the section entitled 'Planet
<br>
Vaporization',
<br>
<p>&quot;Future technologies might produce giant reflectors to focus IR, visible
<br>
and UV photons produced by the sun onto the planet. Materials making up the
<br>
surface of solid planets have boiling points from 2500 to 3800 degrees K.
<br>
Applying sufficient energy would heat the surface material of the planet to
<br>
the boiling point.  If enough energy were applied, a significant fraction
<br>
of the gas molecules would achieve escape velocity and the planet would
<br>
literally evaporate.&quot;  
<br>
<p>Whatever it was, I'm thinkin', &quot;If you heat up the star--which is after all
<br>
just a ball of hydrogen gas--and it bloats up, and it bloats up some more,
<br>
and you trap the energy from the star in the intervening space between the
<br>
star and the shell, won't that space fill up with heated gas, until finally
<br>
it bears up against the interior of the shell, supporting it against the
<br>
force of gravity?  Won't the Dyson shell become a stellar hot-hydrogen
<br>
balloon?  And what of the temperature profile of the newly configured
<br>
stellar atmosphere?  Cooler in the upper regions, perhaps?  Does the star
<br>
have enough hydrogen to provide the appropriate 
<br>
volume and density of atmosphere?  Can the size of the Dyson shell be
<br>
chosen so as to make it work?
<br>
<p>Once more into the breach!
<br>
<p><p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
