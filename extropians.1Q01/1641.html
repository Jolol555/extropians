[Having finished a major project at work earlier than I anticipated, I find I 
<br>
have a few minutes to write.  I offer the following, which CONTAINS SPOILERS.]
<br>
<p>A long time ago, <a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Crouching%20Tiger,%20Hidden%20Dragon&In-Reply-To=&lt;c4.ea08ceb.2798e12f@aol.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>  wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've been trying to think of an Extropian angle on this film, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;haven't had much luck. 
</em><br>
<p>With good reason.  I happened to unexpectedly see this film with a group of 
<br>
people one evening this week.  Although I was very impressed by its cinematic 
<br>
qualities and readily admit that it is certainly one of the best Chinese 
<br>
martial arts movies ever made, I have ultimately concluded that the film is 
<br>
deeply disturbing for two reasons: It is misleadingly &quot;quasi-historical&quot; and 
<br>
it encourages the unfortunate continuing uncritical pop-culture celebration 
<br>
of superstitious supernaturalism.
<br>
<p>Regarding the first point, I confess to a curmudgeonly habit of grumbling 
<br>
criticism of cinematic anachronism.  One of my favorite targets is the manner 
<br>
in which film depictions of the Arthurian legends are set in some 
<br>
historically indefinite &quot;Middle Ages&quot; and almost invariably contain a gross 
<br>
mishmash of a-historical technologies, especially the grossly wrong equipment 
<br>
of the &quot;knights&quot; with elaborate 16th century plate &quot;art-armor&quot; which in fact 
<br>
saw real combat use only during a very short period of time a thousand years 
<br>
after the time when the real Arthur might have lived.  In these films Camelot 
<br>
is usually shown to be some kind of idealized late mediaeval palace, rather 
<br>
than the rough, run-down abandoned Roman border fortress that it would have 
<br>
been had it actually existed.
<br>
<p>However, the typical absurd Hollywood glamorization of the visual element of 
<br>
the Arthurian legends is relatively harmless.  Most movie audiences know that 
<br>
there is some doubt about the reality of the legends and, if they think about 
<br>
it with any historical knowledge at all, know that whatever reality may lie 
<br>
behind the myths is in the deep mists of a very long-gone era which has 
<br>
little if any direct impact on contemporary life.
<br>
<p>Not so with the world depicted in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&quot;  Although 
<br>
most Western movie-goers won't realize it, the film actually provides many 
<br>
clues to being placed in an identifiable time and place.  Even before the 
<br>
lovely Chen Chang reveals in dialogue that her character Jen Yu is a 
<br>
high-born young Manchu lady, it is apparent that the film is set during the 
<br>
zenith of the Manchu Ching dynasty, probably some time between 1700 and 1850; 
<br>
more likely toward the middle of that period.  We know this because the 
<br>
ethnic Chinese - or &quot;Han&quot; - male characters all wear queues, a hairstyle 
<br>
mandated by their Manchu conquerors when the Ching defeated the last of the 
<br>
native Ming rulers in the 17th century.
<br>
<p>Other clues place the film more precisely within the Ching period.  We can be 
<br>
confident that the film takes place before the earth-shattering upheavals of 
<br>
the Tai-Ping rebellion in the middle of the 19th century (perhaps the 
<br>
largest-scale war in human history and certainly the largest civil uprising). 
<br>
&nbsp;The seeming certainly of Manchu dominance and lack of reference to any kind 
<br>
of Han resentment at the Ching place the film after the initial stages of the 
<br>
dynasty, thus placing it in its middle period.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, the director has gone out of his way to provide further 
<br>
grounding of the film in specific realities of the political and military 
<br>
world of the middle Ching period.  The powerful emperors of the time faced 
<br>
constant low-level threats on the far western borders of the empire from 
<br>
non-Han people (for instance the Uighurs).  A number of capable Manchu 
<br>
military governors were sent to Xinjiang province in the western desert to 
<br>
subdue these rebellious peoples.  Ang Li (the director) has the characters 
<br>
make specific reference to &quot;Governor Yu's&quot; service in Xinjiang and important 
<br>
plot events take place there, with the characters stating that that is the 
<br>
locale, rather than some indefinite &quot;west&quot;.
<br>
<p>So, why does this matter?  Because Ang Li has depicted important aspects of 
<br>
Chinese society during this period in grossly incorrect and dangerously 
<br>
misleading ways.  The two main female characters, Yu Shu Lien (the woman who 
<br>
runs the &quot;security agency&quot;) and Yu Jen (the young Manchu girl), are utterly 
<br>
unrealistic characters.  First, I feel certain that young Yu Jen would have 
<br>
had bound feet.  By this point the Manchus had become quite Sinified and had 
<br>
adopted most aspects of traditional Chinese Confucian culture including, I 
<br>
believe, binding their women's feet.  I checked a picture of Cu Shi, the 
<br>
infamous &quot;Dowager Empress&quot; of the last years of the Ching, and it looks to me 
<br>
like she has bound feet.  A career as a martial arts magician would have been 
<br>
impossible for someone whose feet had been broken into tiny painful stubs, as 
<br>
was the case for all Han women of even moderate social status for many 
<br>
centuries before the time in which the film is set.
<br>
<p>The other character, Yu Shu Lien was even more problematic.  The scene in 
<br>
which she rides proudly by herself through the streets of Beijing is utterly 
<br>
anachronistic.  No such behavior on the part of an educated woman of means 
<br>
would have been tolerated in Confucian China.  While there were certainly 
<br>
examples of powerful women in traditional China, they were exceedingly rare 
<br>
and ALWAYS exercised their power indirectly, through male surrogates (for 
<br>
instance, as in the most infamous example, Cu Shi, mentioned above).  A scene 
<br>
such as that so nonchalantly offered by Li of Yu Shu Lien openly riding a 
<br>
horse unescorted through the city would have set off a riot.
<br>
<p>Other examples of inaccuracies in the depiction of the film's female 
<br>
characters abound.  Yu Shu Lien would likely also have had bound feet, if her 
<br>
father had had anything like the kind of social status she seemed to inherit 
<br>
from him, again making her performance as a &quot;warrior&quot; physically impossible.  
<br>
Beyond this, the Yu family's seeming unquestioning acceptance of their young 
<br>
daughter back into their family and arrangement of her marriage to a Manchu 
<br>
prince would have been unthinkable after she had been &quot;sexually liberated&quot; by 
<br>
a non-Han &quot;barbarian&quot;.
<br>
<p>Again, why does it matter?  As one of the people I watched the movie with 
<br>
asked when I began expressing my irritation at these things said &quot;Can't you 
<br>
just enjoy the story?&quot;  If the film had been set in some indeterminate past, 
<br>
perhaps.  But one aspect of the movie that has drawn a lot of comment is its 
<br>
depiction of &quot;female empowerment&quot;.  I don't think it does the cause of women 
<br>
in China or the rest of the Sinitic world good to be unrealistic about just 
<br>
how deeply misogynistic traditional Chinese culture was -- and more 
<br>
importantly -- is.  Confucianism's glorification of inequality at every level 
<br>
of society, including explicitly between men and women, is still a living, 
<br>
powerful force in Asia.  Depiction of female characters in the way we see 
<br>
them in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; lulls people into believing that the 
<br>
burden of the past is lighter than in fact it is.
<br>
<p>My second complaint about the film is one that I level at much of what comes 
<br>
out of Hollywood and the general &quot;pop culture machine&quot; these days: The 
<br>
uncritical depiction of supernatural phenomena continues the process of 
<br>
&quot;dumbing down&quot; our cultural world.  It isn't enough that the stars of 
<br>
&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; are consummate martial arts experts.  No, 
<br>
they must also be able to fly by leaping or simply pointing their fingers.  
<br>
<p>China, like the rest of the world, is awash in a rising sea of superstition 
<br>
and belief in the supernatural.  The surprising strength and growth of the 
<br>
&quot;Fa Long Gong movement&quot; shows just how ready people are to embrace nonsense.  
<br>
On our movie and television screens we come to expect that people flying 
<br>
through an act of will, seeing ghosts, being possessed by demons, finding 
<br>
criminals through telepathy or being visited by angels is an everyday 
<br>
experience.  Meanwhile scientists are almost always depicted as 
<br>
poorly-adjusted geeks at best and &quot;evil geniuses&quot; at worst.  &quot;Science&quot; in the 
<br>
movies is just a convenient label to put on whatever gimmick the screenwriter 
<br>
needs to throw into a story to get out of plot jam.
<br>
<p>Yes, Ang Li's &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is a beautiful, 
<br>
well-constructed film.  And that is perhaps why it has irritated me so much: 
<br>
Once again, we see the considerable talents of the pop culture machine 
<br>
invested in creating deceptive, seductive nonsense that divorces us from the 
<br>
real past and the real world, when the real past and the real world offer 
<br>
wonders aplenty.
