<em>&gt; Sheesh, give it a break Eugene. The fact that you can't stand to see

</em><br>
<p>Excuse me, but you missed out that nice Mr Jobs, with his Kool-Aid
<br>
stand (&quot;now in six different exclusive flavours!&quot;).
<br>
<p>And while we're on the subject of the little list (of people who won't be
<br>
missed), can I call for a big round of applause for the lawyers who work
<br>
for the DVD Copy Control Association (a cartel that sues into the ground
<br>
anyone who tries to release a free software DVD player -- because they
<br>
charge royalties from anyone who wants to build a player in return for
<br>
the specs to their broken encryption format), and the wonderful people
<br>
who brought us CPRM? And Jeff Bezos, for patenting something so utterly
<br>
obvious that I can only conclude that the examining officer was asleep
<br>
or dead, and then using it to sue the shit out of all his business rivals
<br>
(instead of competing on the merits of his product).
<br>
<p>I think all these folks need a glad hand, along with (UK bias showing,
<br>
and getting off the topic of the eevils of the computer industry)
<br>
Jack &quot;control freak&quot; Straw, Michael &quot;prince of darkness&quot; Howard, Tony
<br>
&quot;toothpaste advert&quot; Blair, William &quot;foetus&quot; Hague, and most other
<br>
mainstream politicians.
<br>
<p>(Normal service will be resumed as soon as I finish chewing the carpet.)
