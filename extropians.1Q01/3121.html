<p>[re impact of citizen recording of police behavior]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, you know, I hate to wax realistic on you--but at the moment, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  this is not bogus; this is reality--and cyborgish humans are bogus. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Reality has its drawbacks.
</em><br>
<p>Ahh, but reality has a way of catching up with &quot;bogus&quot; ideas.  First, recall 
<br>
Rodney King.  Second, note that the camera I bought to plug into my computer 
<br>
recently (that I mentioned in another post a moment ago) cost less than $50 
<br>
retail and is packaged in a plastic housing smaller than 4 cubic inches, most 
<br>
of which is empty space.  Third, note that video and audio data compression 
<br>
technology continues to progress at an astonishing rate.  Fourth, note that 
<br>
the price of digital storage technology continues to drop precipitously.  
<br>
Fifth, the price of the technology for detecting a device's position (i.e. 
<br>
GPS) is also falling continuously.  Finally, note that the intersection of 
<br>
PDA and cell phone technology proceeds apace.
<br>
<p>Put all these things together and you have at least the distinct possibility 
<br>
that a significant number of &quot;normal&quot; people will at some point be carrying 
<br>
audio-video recording devices that automagically note and record the time and 
<br>
place of a specific recorded event.  Although I by no means agree with all of 
<br>
the moral conclusions he draws from observing these same facts and 
<br>
possibilities, David Brin has made a strong case that the reality of a 
<br>
populous equipped for ubiquitous audio-video recording will have a 
<br>
significant impact on the legal system and society at large.
<br>
<p>I don't think it's a big leap to project that by 2010 (2020 at the very 
<br>
latest) an &quot;always-on&quot; audio-video PDA will be a CHEAP and universal item of 
<br>
personal equipment.  Yes, it's a bigger leap from there to an implant.  But 
<br>
even the &quot;mature&quot; external PDA will have significant impact.  For instance, I 
<br>
can easily imagine that at a certain point a practical presumption will be 
<br>
raised that a person has a right to keep her PDA with her and on throughout 
<br>
any encounter with the police.  Such a common-sense presumption would lead to 
<br>
effects on the relationship of citizens to the police as great or greater 
<br>
than Miranda and its progeny.
