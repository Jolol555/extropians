<em>&gt;It's really not what you'd call a &quot;fast&quot; movie, y'know.  2001 dates from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time when movies were much, much more slower-paced.  That sequence at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end alone... trying to watch &quot;2001&quot; after &quot;The Matrix&quot; is like trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;watch &quot;Psycho&quot; after &quot;Hellraiser II&quot;.  You sit there and just marvel at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the idea that this was once cutting-edge; that people could think of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movie as being anything but homey, wholesome, and relaxing.  You do it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the historical value and to just appreciate how different things must have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been a couple of generations ago.  If 2001 were released today, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flop.  How can you demand of my generation that they watch it?
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, you may want to reconsider and expand your self-designed 
<br>
curriculum so that you might be better able to appreciate classical works 
<br>
of art. To say that you watched &quot;2001&quot; only for its historic value seems 
<br>
like saying you listen to J.S. Bach's orchestral suites only to observe 
<br>
technological advances in musical instruments (speaking of fast vs.slow, 
<br>
recordings of J.S. Bach's music made in the 1940's show a significantly 
<br>
slower tempo than those made in the 1990's and 2000's).
<br>
<p>What a person likes and doesn't like is at least somewhat subjective. I 
<br>
quite enjoyed &quot;The Matrix&quot; although I was disappointed by certain aspects 
<br>
of the plot. But OTOH I recently saw &quot;What Women Want&quot; which, as I recall, 
<br>
you raved about. I thought the acting was good, the cinematography and 
<br>
editing were outstanding, and it had its moments of humor and philosophical 
<br>
probing; but overall I thought it was a pretty silly movie, and not even an 
<br>
accurate representation of the time period in which it was made. The young 
<br>
friends I saw it with shared my opinion, so it's not just an Old Fogey 
<br>
thing.  These same young people can watch a movie such as &quot;2001&quot; or 
<br>
Bunuel's &quot;Los Olvidados&quot; and recognize them as classics which still have 
<br>
something worthwhile to say after all these years (&quot;Los Olvidados&quot; was 
<br>
released around 20 years earlier than &quot;2001&quot;).
<br>
<p>My daughter's high school offers a course in classic films. IMO classic 
<br>
films are as much a part of our culture as classic books, and I'm glad to 
<br>
see the course being offered. I'm curious about how common this is in high 
<br>
schools. Are there any high school students on the list, or parents with 
<br>
high school kids? If so, does your school (or your kids' shool) offer such 
<br>
courses? If I were designing a high school literature review course, I 
<br>
think I'd include films along with books, in the same course.
