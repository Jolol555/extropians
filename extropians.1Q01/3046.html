Because next thing you know it will be used to automatically track 
<br>
the comings and goings of targeted noncriminal individuals. Stakeouts 
<br>
are manpower intensive. Not anymore--set up one of these doohickeys, 
<br>
or several, near the target area--and automatically record and ID 
<br>
everyone who comes and goes. Their faces will already be on record 
<br>
from drivers licenses. Set 'em up outside porno shops, see who 
<br>
visits. Outside areas where political rallies are held. At major 
<br>
intersections. Track everyone, everywhere, all the time--
<br>
automatically. Then just punch in a name and see where he's been for 
<br>
the past ten years.
<br>
<p>I'd call those tactics a real problem.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ugh, but The Register's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all-corporations-and-governments-are-out-to-screw-you point of view 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more objective? :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Everyone entering Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida last 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sunday was subjected to the surveillance system cameras, set up at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the entrance turnstiles. No notice or disclosure was ever given, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;no one, therefore, had an opportunity to decline to enter the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stadium if they should have objected to this unprecedented treatment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would having extra security at a big event like the Super Bowl be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a reason to give notice?  Were they doing brain scans or illegally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tapping cell phones or something?  Would having extra officers there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been a reason to give notice?  Of course not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;'Similar or matching.' This clearly acknowledges the possibility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that innocent civilians going about their peaceable business may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stopped, hassled, even arrested, merely for resembling someone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;naughty. This raises sticky issues regarding the presumption of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;innocence many of us were encouraged to believe in during our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;grammar-school civics lessons. Is there a violation of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;principle when a person is required to produce evidence that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are not, in fact, the evil bastard whom they unfortunately resemble?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a problem in the non-technological law enforcement world as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.  It's unfortunate, but mistakes in identity happen.  The police 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such situations have a responsibility to treat suspects with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect and to ascertain their true identity as quickly as possible. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is the technology at fault or the tactic of using the technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a public place?  Maybe if the technology got a few more criminals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the streets, the odds of your looking like one of them would be
