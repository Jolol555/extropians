<em>&gt; &gt; The simple facts are that the kinds of people who are drawn into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and technical fields tend to be TERRIBLE communicators in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have an impact on the culture at large.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I wonder why this is. Wish we could talk about this on the list and figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it out. It hasn't always been so.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that sci/tech draws people with bad communication 
<br>
skills.  Perhaps it does, but I think there are very few naturals when it 
<br>
comes to Saganesque standards of skill.  All people, even the best, have to 
<br>
polish and hone their skills.  I remember reading Richard Dawkins a while 
<br>
ago.  He met a young woman arguing the creationist cause in a debate.  It 
<br>
turned out she didn't believe a word of it, but was doing it to sharpen her 
<br>
skills (the old &quot;if I can argue THIS successfully, I can argue just about 
<br>
anything!&quot; adage).  I not sure, but I hope she became involved in the 
<br>
Sciences!:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Even getting the people who could afford to fund the grooming of good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spokespeople to recognize the need seems to be an uphill task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is something the people on this list could begin to remedy immediately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Beginning with each person funding their own grooming (funding in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time as well as money).

<p>Agreed.  Starting with those of us who work for large corporations.  Most 
<br>
of them run assertiveness/comms skills courses, usually gratis to 
<br>
employees.  I'm hoping to look into this myself.  For those who don't have 
<br>
such access, speaking at local events/clubs etc can be a good way to 
<br>
&quot;blood&quot; oneself, esp. if it's being recorded.  Nerve-wracking if you've 
<br>
ever done it, I know.  But sometimes you just have to bite the bullet.  Let 
<br>
your passion for your subject matter drive you.  I wonder if doing local 
<br>
theatre would help someone overcome reservations about speaking out?
<br>
<p>You can bet the Luddies aren't luddite about presentation and comms.
<br>
<p>Slan,
<br>
<p><p><p>James...
<br>
<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
