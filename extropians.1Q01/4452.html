Good point, Loree. I also like the part where he says, &quot;If you think critically about a denomination, it does not make you anti-religion.&quot;
<br>
<p>Just so happens, Mr. Heston, that I AM anti-religion. You got a problem wit dat?
<br>
<p>I also was surprised to read his claim that we &quot;are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.&quot; Huh? That's high grade poppycock. I would be surprised that Heston would say that considering he lived to see the repression that existed in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, when the USA hounded dissidents, denied them passports and jobs, planted false rumors and kept a large portion of the black population without even the power to vote. And that's not even addressing all of the oppression that was inflicted upon various peoples in previous eras. Now when did women get the vote? Kind of puts his complaints about occasional abuses of political correctness into a different perspective. He's complaining about college men getting dating instructions? Cry me a river!

<p>Maybe it's just me, but maybe not.  Didn't Mr. Heston
<br>
on the one hand condemn the stifling of freedom of
<br>
speech on campus and on the other BRAG about his role
<br>
in stifling Ice-T's freedom of speech?
<br>
<p>I don't think it was damned fine at all...  It struck
<br>
me as right wing, reactionary, illogical, muddled and
<br>
emotionally loaded.  Not exptropic, not libertarian,
<br>
not rational.
