<p>No, there wouldn't.  In fact, it would be to their advantage to have it
<br>
treated as a flip dismissal - and the resulting negative media
<br>
attention would most likely further marginalize true cryonics research.
<br>
Chris puts it as &quot;ethics&quot;; I cast it in terms of practicality - which,
<br>
I admit, tends to be my ethics in practice.  The probabilities are that
<br>
filing a lawsuit against doctors who do not advise of cryo would do
<br>
more harm than good towards the end we wish to promote at this time,
<br>
therefore it is not advisable at this time.  Apologies, as always, that
<br>
this is how things appear.
