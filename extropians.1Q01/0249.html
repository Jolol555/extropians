Remember the art of the soundbite is practiced by both speakers and
<br>
newsies.
<br>
<p>Either is a possibility here. I would guess it was the latter, given
<br>
Bill's recent communications. His original &quot;Unless we take all
<br>
appropriate precautions...&quot; might have been left on the cutting room
<br>
floor in some &quot;journalists'&quot; pursuit of STORY over fair presentation.
<br>
<p>Bonus question for your Fair Witness certificate: was what you saw
<br>
continuous, or edited?

<em>&gt; A few nights ago I was fascinated to see a brief interview with Bill Joy on CBS evening news.  The topic was &quot;robotic artificial intelligence&quot; and a brief overview was given of some advances in this area.  Then Bill Joy was shown(I had never seen him before) and he summed up his quick comments with &quot;what humanity can do, it will do, and so humanity will destroy itself with these new technologies!&quot;  For such a supposedly intelligent man I was taken aback by his statement.  By his own flawed logic we should have already destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons.
