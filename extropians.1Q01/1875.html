<em>&gt; What I dislike is the seriousness with which your government approaches its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens. You walk up into a government institution, and the police officers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in there walk around with shotguns, and the sign says something like &quot;It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a federal crime to attack a police officer&quot; (don't remember the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words). Drive too fast, and they put you in jail. And so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I am talking about pretty much resembles what you and other posters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned as one of the primary justifications to posess firearms. That may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be true, you are the sole judge of that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I was trying to use the same argument the other way around: I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is possibility that attitude of the citizens reinforces the attitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the government. Which in turn reinforces the attitude of the citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Until there's a civil war...
</em><br>
<p>I won't argue too much with the idea that we seem to be heading to
<br>
becoming a police state or at least toward having the State consider
<br>
itself as paramount and the individuals it was supposed to serve as its
<br>
servants.  But this turn-about came from forgetting our roots in
<br>
individual rights and the function of government in protecting those
<br>
rights.  It did not come from the cops getting scared.  Also, I know
<br>
quite a few cops of various kinds.  Most of them are pretty decent
<br>
people that do not take the attitude you describe.  Too many of them
<br>
though are quite willing to enforce any law they are handed regardless
<br>
of how unjust they may consider it to be.  But most cops I have actually
<br>
dealt with were not pointing shotguns at me or threatening to haul me to
<br>
jail.  I have seen some who are bloody tyrants though.  I am more
<br>
frightened of government goons such as from the DEA or IRS or FBI than I
<br>
am of the run-of-mill police officer.  
<br>
<p>The right of self-defense is not contingent on perceived threats from
<br>
government employees or anyone else.  It simply grows out of one's right
<br>
to one's own life and person.  If I do not have the right to defend
<br>
myself against someone attempting to kill or seriously harm me then in
<br>
what manner do I have the right to my own life?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are two cases to look at, and you're looking at the other one. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are talking about denying an individual the right to have a gun, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact on the individual's quality of right is negative. Taking away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's rights from the outside is a Bad Thing. I believe in that as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the perspective is totally different if everyone decides that, &quot;OK, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want any of this dangerous stuff in our sight, let's get rid of it -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and let's make sure the bad guys can't get it, either.&quot; The total absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guns in a society *does* improve the quality of life of every participating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indivudual - you can't be shot if there are no guns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>And you can't defend yourself against a younger, stronger and possibly
<br>
faster agressor or a group of the same.  Exactly how do these people
<br>
simply go away if there are no guns?  They don't.  The principle of the
<br>
right to one's own life and what it applies is still being violated.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; In a choice of life or death, who wins matters a lot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eh - win win, lose lose. Whenever there is a conflict, both sides lose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no way to win a conflict. In the overall scheme of things, long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness might matter a little bit. Short term conflicts, and their short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term results, matter not. I am sure life after death is just as nice as life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before death. No need to worry too much about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;/personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What &quot;life after death&quot;?  As far as I know, there is none.  I will take
<br>
something over nothing every single time.  You have no way to be &quot;sure&quot;
<br>
of any such thing.  I am beginning to believe you use words, especially
<br>
ones like &quot;I am sure&quot; extremely loosely.  So loosely I see little use in
<br>
continuing this conversation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In a choice of being free or enslaved or easy to enslave,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it matters a lot where one is on the spectrum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See above. [But do note that what I'm saying is just my personal philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's quite extreme, and it does not necessarily have to be yours. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would probably disagree with me. I let them disagree, no problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Since you don't believe there is any truth or that anything matters at
<br>
all (up to and including whether one lives or dies) I am not surprised
<br>
by that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Above is not to mean I don't agree with you, it's that I can't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemplate what you said because the way you said it is in conflict with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I recognize as universal laws. It's meaningless to me.]
</em><br>
<p>As far as I see you deny the very concept of meaning being meaningful.
