<p>The incongruity is even more pronounced when you consider that these
<br>
people are invariably claiming to be some flavor of anarchist or
<br>
libertarian-socialists while at the same time advocating the US
<br>
equivalent of a Soviet State to accomplish their political aims (and at
<br>
the same time saying the Soviet Union was an aberration, not 'real'
<br>
socialism, etc). They claim they oppose people like Kazinski while
<br>
fawning over his Manifesto. I've been embedding myself in their online
<br>
communities, and its rather baffling, still, at how illogical,
<br>
irrational, and emotionally motivated they all seem to be. They have a
<br>
fundamental inability, typically, to carry on a rational debate: they
<br>
either launch into foaming at the mouth or else dismiss your arguments,
<br>
claiming its covered in the Anarchism FAQ (especially when it isn't).
<br>
When you actually counter their points they get all flustery claiming
<br>
that that venue is not a place for debate, that all anarchists have
<br>
always been socialists and anti-capital (typically because they kick out
<br>
anyone who isn't), and that you don't belong there.
<br>
What they are are big government totalitarian socialists.
