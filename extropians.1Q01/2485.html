Hopefully the AIs will be intelligent enough to grasp that taxation is
<br>
actually theft (and immoral) under the auspices of benlovence and will
<br>
decide that voluntary methods of financing would be a moral solution. :)
<br>
<p>i.e. One good plan Vie heard for voluntary financing is contract protection
<br>
fees. When you finance a car or house or whatever (included credit cards),
<br>
you participate in a contract with a person, corporation, etc... This
<br>
contract should be protected by law only if the people who sign it want that
<br>
protection. Obviously this would be a smart protection to have if your the
<br>
seller so you would make it a prerequisite for buying the product. The buyer
<br>
would have the choice of buying or not so for him, its a voluntary issue as
<br>
well. The government could charge 5% of the cost of the value of the
<br>
contract as an &quot;enforcement fee&quot;. With all the credit card transactions
<br>
taking place daily, this could easily make the government a large sum of
<br>
money for their services. During times of war they could increase the
<br>
percentage or lower it during times of economic prosperity or in the case
<br>
where their running surpluses. The cool thing is that nothing in this plan
<br>
is forced on the people at the point of a gun. If you want to draw up a
<br>
contract to sell you car to a friend but not buy the governments protection,
<br>
your perfectly free to do so. Just don't go crying to them when your friend
<br>
decides not to pay. ;)
<br>
<p>I know that was a bit off track, but it sounds like such a good idea, I had
<br>
to find a way to inject it in.
