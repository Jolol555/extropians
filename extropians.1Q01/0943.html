<p>Actually, I think most of the calculations on power dissipation for
<br>
replication and operation are largely bogus. It's much too early for
<br>
anything definite. I don't see why we can't
<br>
develop something with an energetic footprint of biological life or
<br>
better. Your brain burns 15-20 W, a bee brain about a microwatt. You
<br>
don't have to build anything peu a peu, there's controlled polymerisation
<br>
and self-assembly.
