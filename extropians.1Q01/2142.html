<p>The difficulty in answering this question is due partly to the
<br>
fact that what one has in mind to dignify with the term
<br>
&quot;computer&quot; is a moving target.  In the late 70's, some people were content
<br>
to spend a couple of thousand dollars on something like a Kaypro Z-80
<br>
based CP/M machine and proudly call it a computer.  Good for
<br>
serious word processing back then, but no good
<br>
at all for surfing the Web today.  It's amazing to look in old issues
<br>
of _Byte_ magazine (I have a friend with bound sets going back
<br>
to the beginning) and see that 8-bit Z-80 class chips cost more than a
<br>
hundred dollars when they were new, same as respectable (if less than
<br>
state-of-the-art) chips do today.  The same Z-80-class functionality today
<br>
can be found as embedded microprocessor &quot;cores&quot; -- perhaps with the same
<br>
architecture and instruction set as those old stand-alone chips -- which form
<br>
part of larger chips found in everything from VCRs and answering machines to
<br>
infrared remote controls and automobile ignition systems.  We hardly even think of them
<br>
as &quot;computers&quot; -- they're just the stuff inside all those gizmos
<br>
we use without thinking.  The Commodore 64, the Radio Shack TRS-80 and
<br>
their brethren are for museum-goers (although the Computer Museum in Boston
<br>
is no more, alas) and nostalgia buffs to moon over, not for serious
<br>
work or serious fun.
<br>
<p>However, let me try to pin down Kaku's statement a little more
<br>
precisely.
<br>
<p>The book you're referring to is, I guess, _Visions: How Science Will
<br>
Revolutionize the 21st Century_, which was published in hardcover
<br>
by Doubleday in 1997.  When Kaku is referring to computers vis-a-vis
<br>
the Internet, I presume he's talking about the browser end rather
<br>
than the server end (or the networking stuff in between) -- anyway,
<br>
that's what I'll focus on.  I'll take the term &quot;computer&quot; to mean
<br>
the minimum hardware that's adequate to run a Web browser of some
<br>
sort.
<br>
<p>Around the time Kaku wrote those words, the biggest bang-for-the-
<br>
buck in hardware was probably to be found not in any desktop PC
<br>
(or Macintosh!) but in the Web-browsing appliances that first
<br>
appeared in 1996 -- I'm thinking specifically of the original WebTV
<br>
box.  I bought a Sony INT-W100 &quot;Internal terminal&quot; at the end
<br>
of '96 -- it cost between $200 and $300 retail, and contained
<br>
a 112 MHz IDT/MIPS R4640 64-bit RISC processor (64 bits internally,
<br>
thought it almost certainly had a 32-bit data bus), which was
<br>
pretty damned impressive at the time.  The specs for these devices
<br>
can still be found at <a href="http://www.webtv.com/products/classic/specs.html">http://www.webtv.com/products/classic/specs.html</a>
<br>
That processor chip cost $30 in quantities of 10,000, according to
<br>
<a href="http://www.idt.com/news/1996/July96/webtv.html">http://www.idt.com/news/1996/July96/webtv.html</a>
<br>
<p>OK, fast forward to today, and the most bang for the buck is still
<br>
found, not on the desktop, but in game consoles such as the Sony
<br>
Playstation 2 and the new Microsoft X-box.  I'm not sure whether the retail
<br>
price for the latter has been fixed yet, but some folks are expecting
<br>
it to sell for around $300 (profit margins are razor-thin on this sort of
<br>
price-sensitive hardware that kids are expected to spend their
<br>
saved-up allowances on, or cadge from their parents).  The processor chip
<br>
in this box (it also has a sophisticated graphics chip, of course -- as did
<br>
the WebTV box for that matter, and as do most desktop PCs these days)
<br>
is thought to be a 733 MHz Pentium-class chip.  I'd say that
<br>
$30 quantity OEM price would be a pretty reasonable guess at the
<br>
cost of this chip, too -- it certainly couldn't be much more
<br>
in a $300-at-retail box.
<br>
<p>Now, taking the original WebTV box from '96 as the minimum chunk
<br>
of processing capacity we're deigning to call a &quot;computer&quot;, then the
<br>
cost of that much processing as a chunk of the price of the X-box
<br>
processor can be estimated.  Leaving aside any questions of
<br>
architectural differences between the 112 MHz MIPS chip and
<br>
the 733 MHz Pentium clone and just looking at the ratio of
<br>
clock speeds, then the cost of an original WebTV's worth of
<br>
processing power has declined to around (112/733 * $30) = $4.60.
<br>
<p>So I'd say Kaku's estimate was a tad over-optimistic.
<br>
<p>Notice that people probably aren't going to be getting computers
<br>
out of gumball machines any time soon.  People expect to be
<br>
able to get a desktop PC for less than $1,000 these days (though
<br>
the sub-$1,000 PC was a much-heralded milestone when it happened
<br>
a year and a half or two years ago), and the $1,800 that a &quot;serious&quot;
<br>
1982 Kaypro (let alone a really serious -- or maybe just overpriced --
<br>
$3,000 Xerox 820 CP/M machine) would have cost is considered a lot to
<br>
spend for a consumer PC these days, and would be expected to get you
<br>
almost state-of-the-art.  The way the market is evolving is
<br>
that every time you get a new PC, you expect to get a whole
<br>
lot more for the same or moderately less money.  So the game
<br>
consoles cost about the same as the WebTV boxes did four years ago,
<br>
but they do a whole lot more (nobody would look twice at the original
<br>
WebTV box for $300 put next to an X-box for $300 or a Sony
<br>
Playstation 2 -- both of the latter are in fact Internet-enabled,
<br>
I believe).
<br>
<p>Estimating the present-day cost (as a chunk of the X-box processor)
<br>
of one of those late-70's Z-80 class chips is a bit of an eye
<br>
opener, though.  Let's see, the clock speed of the original (1976) Z-80
<br>
was 2.5 MHz -- see the Web site &quot;Great Microprocessors of the Past
<br>
and Present&quot;, at <a href="http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/CIC/archive/cpu_history.html">http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/CIC/archive/cpu_history.html</a>
<br>
also &quot;Chronology of Personal Computers&quot; at <a href="http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/comphist/">http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/comphist/</a>
<br>
This time I'll include a factor of four penalty for the 8-bit vs. the
<br>
32-bit bus, so, very roughly:  (2.5/733*4 * $30) = $0.03.  Considering the Z-80
<br>
originally cost on the order of a hundred dollars (though I can't seem to find
<br>
a reference for the original price on the Web), that's pretty impressive
<br>
3,000-fold price reduction in 25 years.
<br>
<p>The Zilog Z-80 is still available after 25 years as a stand-alone microprocessor --
<br>
see <a href="http://www.zilog.com/products/">http://www.zilog.com/products/</a>
<br>
I couldn't find any pricing information on Zilog's Web site, but I'm sure
<br>
the chip costs more than three cents, even in quantity!  I saw a reference
<br>
to a $2 price for this chip, but it may well be less in large quantities.
