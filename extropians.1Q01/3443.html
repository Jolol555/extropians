That's understandable, but what does disparaging nanotech etc have to do 
<br>
with that?  If anything, most of the technologies they are complaining 
<br>
about are the ones that would allow their vision to come true.  And if it's 
<br>
not the technology that's the problem, why do they go to lengths to 
<br>
&quot;criminalize&quot; them and those who develop them?  Shouldn't they be focussed 
<br>
more on the particular companies they feel are guilty?
<br>
<p>It all sounds more like undirected fear of change to me.  Is the world 
<br>
really moving that fast?  Can't say I've had any more trouble keeping up 
<br>
than I did 10 years ago...

&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
