<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me add to this: the unbounded techno-optimism is out of step with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unbounded? Where?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the extropian principles.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, really. Where? In previous versions, there was &quot;Boundless Expansion&quot; 
<br>
but there has never been boundless optimism. On the contrary, optimism must 
<br>
be combined with careful thinking. What's more, we have publicly shifted 
<br>
more towards focusing on challenges, risks, and dangers to be discussed and 
<br>
overcome. Just look at the sub-title of the last conference (and everything 
<br>
about the next one).
<br>
<p>The discussions on this list also show that it's quite wrong to think that 
<br>
we are boundlessly optimistic. No doubt we need to continue working to 
<br>
dispel such a view of us, but any careful journalist or academic researcher 
<br>
should know better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm just saying that new technologies have side-effects, sometimes disastrous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ones, and insisting that their deployment is *always* beneficial isn't going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to fool anyone (and is going to make us look like idiots).
</em><br>
<p>Funny, I don't anyone here saying disagreeing with you. Can you say &quot;straw 
<br>
man&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, your question for $64K: why is Extropianism so overtly associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with unmitigated optimism that it's seen as a joke in some circles?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps because we are optimistic about some drastic things (such as aging 
<br>
and death) that most people continue to be doggedly pessimistic about. 
<br>
Because we point out the real constructive possibilities for all kinds of 
<br>
historically inevitable things that people either don't want to think about 
<br>
or rationalize as being a good and healthy part of the human condition.
<br>
<p>That said, I don't think we have room for complacency. We need to continue 
<br>
to grapple more with the challenges and objections (as we did in several 
<br>
responses to Bill Joy, as we did at Extro-4, as we do on this list), rather 
<br>
than only pointing out the positive possibilities. In the early days we 
<br>
primarily did point out the good possibilities, partly because *someone* 
<br>
has to. Now we're going through a process of reaching out to deal with 
<br>
fears and to deeper examination of risks and drawbacks. I just wrote about 
<br>
some of my concerns regarding human cloning (by people who don't understand 
<br>
that they are not replicating people) on the Wired email list.
<br>
<p>Still, I won't apologize for being primarily optimistic in a culture that 
<br>
continues to see death, human stupidity, and other limits as inevitable and 
<br>
even desirable.
<br>
<p>Onward!
