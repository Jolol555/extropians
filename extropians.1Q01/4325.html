<p>
An experiment for funding speakers at Extro conferences:
<br>
<p>1.  Add a form to the Extropy web site, that allows a visitor to suggest
<br>
a name for a speaker for an Extro event, plus a small blurb indicating
<br>
how much one would be willing to pay to see this person speak.
<br>
<p>2.  Set up an account with EZCmoney.com.  Here's how EZCMoney works:
<br>
<p>&quot;....Customers create an account directly at the EZCMoney Web site.
<br>
Account creation requires only an e-mail address, a user name of their
<br>
own creation, a password of their choosing, and a clue in case they
<br>
forget
<br>
their password. They then send funds to EZCardInc to open their account.
<br>
<p>Customers are then able to spend that money anywhere on the Web that
<br>
&nbsp;accepts EZCMoney by providing their EZCMoney account number instead
<br>
of a credit card number.
<br>
<p>The merchant contacts EZCardInc asking for
<br>
payment via a secure Web API or via a Web form (for manual processing).
<br>
EZCardInc notifies the customer via email to confirm the purchase and
<br>
asks him/her to approve the transfer of funds to the merchant. Once the
<br>
customer approves the purchase, the merchant is notified and gets paid,
<br>
and proceeds to process the order....&quot;
<br>
<p>3.  Ask Extropy members to pre-pay (via EZCmoney) for the speaker they
<br>
wish to see.  After a month or two, find out how much the speakers with
<br>
the most pre-paid amounts would charge in order to speak at the Extro
<br>
conference.  Post an online chart showing how much more  you would need
<br>
to get to afford each speaker.
<br>
<p>4.  After you get enough money for the speaker + administrative fee, ask
<br>
EZCMoney for payment, at which point EZCMoney will ask the Extropy
<br>
Institute members who have prepaid to confirm their pre-payment.  (Some
<br>
will likely renege, so you may have to seek some additional payments.  )
