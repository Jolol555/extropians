Friends,
<br>
<p>Regarding my advocacy of a lawsuit charging the medical profession with
<br>
negligently failing to adopt cryonics as a valid standard of care,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo writes, and I submit a point by point rebuttal.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Jeff Davis wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It's the 'ethical' part that puzzles me.  I don't think it's unethical to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Given that you have no legal basis for your proposed court challenge, 
</em><br>
<p>Certainly you believe that to be the case.  I take the opposite position.
<br>
In such a situation it is for the court to make the determination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;it's unethical to tie doctors up in court and force them to waste 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their money defending themselves.
</em><br>
<p>It is unethical for those in the medical profession and the attendent
<br>
regulatory infrastructure to prematurely abandon and condemn to certain
<br>
death those in their care.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Gene Leitl mentioned the multitude of people who had died without benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of suspension, and used the term medical malpractice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Malpractice requires a legally &quot;reasonable&quot; level of negligence.
</em><br>
<p>What was legally reasonable yesterday may not be so today.  With all due
<br>
respect, that's the nature of progress.  Many professions tend to be
<br>
conservative in regards moving forward.  Sometimes a little legal prodding
<br>
can hurry them along.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Cryonics currently is nothing more than fantasy.
</em><br>
<p>A point of view not held by all.  Dr. Semmelweiss's ideas about sanitation
<br>
were once a 'fantasy'.  Clearly what is fantasy and what is reality is a
<br>
matter of opinion, not fact.  The consequence of this opinion is the
<br>
certain death of millions, a matter of importance too great to be left
<br>
unchallenged. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has a zero rate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of return of people to the human population, and I've yet to see any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence that that's going to change right over the horizon... or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;next horizon... or the one after that.  
</em><br>
<p>With all due respect, I don't think you understand cryonics.  Please don't
<br>
feel insulted.  There is an aspect of cryonics so unprecedented, so outside
<br>
the human experience, that even people intimately acquainted with cryonics,
<br>
people who know the FACTS, still don't 'get' it.  Cryonics stops time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No doctor is being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrably negligent for not suggesting cryonics to his dying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patients.
</em><br>
<p>Demonstrably?  Time will tell.  That's the point.  Cryonics conquers time.  
<br>
<p>If the doctor doesn't know about cryonics one might reasonably question
<br>
whether he should know.  If he does know, does he understand it, and does
<br>
he have a duty to understand it?  These are questions for a court to
<br>
decide.  With benefit of hindsight, ask yourself the same questions of the
<br>
doctors of Semmelweiss's time regarding the matter of sanitation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Nitrogen was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;liquified for the first time back in 1877, so theoretically, everyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;has died since that time could have been suspended.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oh, had they solved crystallization problems back then as well?  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't think that we'd even fully done that today.
</em><br>
<p>I detect a note of smugness.  Try out the receiving end:  You know, I
<br>
suppose, all that the future holds?  I grovel before the awesome power of
<br>
your intellect,...or is it your crystal ball?   
<br>
<p>Cryonics stops time.  That is its unprecedented power.  What has been
<br>
accomplished from 1877 until today is irrelevant.  The accomplishments of
<br>
the next thousand years?,... irrelevant.  Cryonics brings to bear the
<br>
limits of the possible.  Grasp the implications of that and you will then
<br>
'get' cryonics.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Ettinger first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;published his cryonics thesis in &quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot; back in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1962.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, he discovered how we can successfully even come close to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieving restoration from a cryonic state?  No.
</em><br>
<p>He 'gets' it.  What will be possible in the future is unknown in the
<br>
present.  What are the limits of the possible?  You may believe restoration
<br>
will never be possible, I may believe the opposite.  Irrelevant.  Neither
<br>
of us can know.  What we do know, for certain, is this: the future is
<br>
coming, and with it greater--far greater--technological capabilities.  The
<br>
destiny of those not suspended is equally certain.  It is death, dust.
<br>
Cryonics can't be worse, it can only be better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;   Whatever date you choose, we're talking about a lot of people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have died since, and been condemned, perhaps unnecessarily, to dust.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technology progresses and the thesis gains credence--more people 'get it',
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not just the forward thinking types--you reach a point where arguably,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;ridicule and arbitrary dismissal become negligent in an of themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sure, if the technology progresses and the thesis gains credence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because of the scientific evidence, then doctors who ignore that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence are being negligent. 
</em><br>
<p>The future that cryonics makes accessible is a reality dependent neither on
<br>
human credence nor the imprimtur of science.  Look, I have no beef with
<br>
doctors, they're great, and I'm a good-for-nothing slug.  But the harsher
<br>
the wake-up call, the sooner the payoff.  Cryonics has possibilities,
<br>
burial has none.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My problem with your call to sue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doctors for negligence is that we're not even close to having 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence of any benefits from cryonics, so you have no case.
</em><br>
<p>You don't understand cryonics.  It accesses all that the future makes
<br>
possible.  The future will have plenty of science and plenty of evidence.
<br>
It's not an evidence-free zone, you just can't 'cite' it from the present.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Ironically this is not because the facts have changed, but rather, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;public perception has.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, you need a little thing called &quot;scientific evidence&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>The thermodynamic cessation of time which cryonics achieves is sufficient
<br>
'scientific evidence'.  Existence trumps science.  Existence was a
<br>
'credible' fact long before science become the canonical authority on
<br>
credibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggesting that doctors pursue unscientific treatments for their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patients, or they'll be sued.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Thermodynamics is sufficiently scientific to validate cryonics.  Results
<br>
accumulate with the passage of time.  And the future is a very long time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By the same logic, medical professionals could be sued for not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advising all of their dying patients that they should believe in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jesus Christ. If we can't base a belief upon scientific principles, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we might as well go with a popularity contest, right?  Next to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number of people in this world (doctors included) who believe that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jesus Christ is the solution to death, cryonics adherents are nothing.
</em><br>
<p>The analogy is inapplicable.  Religion is clearly unscientific.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;When 'ridiculous' changes to 'perhaps'.  A medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;professional has a duty to provide the best care that he can based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;rational judgement, not on irrational prejudices or ossified beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The only thing that's irrational here is the claim that doctors are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being negligent for not pursuing cryonics with their patients as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viable medical treatment.
</em><br>
<p>You don't understand cryonics.  It accesses all future
<br>
human/transhuman/post-human/non-human technological capabilities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Would we want to see our medical professionals be constantly engaged 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in lawsuits based on wishful speculation?  
</em><br>
<p>A rhetorical (ie screwy) question.  &quot;Wishful speculation&quot; reflects your
<br>
failed understanding of cryonics.  I am advocating one lawsuit, and one
<br>
lawsuit only (though, like the tobacco lawsuits and the energizer bunny, it
<br>
might keep going and going and going...):  the lawsuit that forces the
<br>
powers that be to look at cryonics until they 'get' it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I want the medical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;professionals who treat me and my family to be firmly entrenched in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the scientific method and all that extends from it.  I don't want my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doctor to talk to me about Jesus Christ, Vishnu, the healing power of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;magnets, acupuncture, or cryonics unless he has some scientific basis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for doing so.
</em><br>
<p>A gratuitous grab bag.  
<br>
<p>Thermodynamics is science, ergo, cryonics is science (unusual in the
<br>
respect that it is an ongoing experiment.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;So, despite the fact that, as I said, I don't think the case would be won,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I do think there is a strong ethical foundation.  And, perhaps I failed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;emphasize it strongly enough, the main intent (as a practical matter) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the civil action would not be to win, but rather to put the issue intthe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;public spotlight under conditions where the scientific and legal theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;would be elaborated with thoroughness and seriousness.  Flip dismissiveness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and smirky ridicule might be somewhat reduced in a real court with real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;power and billions of real dollars (apparently, potentially) at stake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In other words, you'd like to use frivolous lawsuits as publicity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stunts.  You believe that it's okay for doctors and hospitals to have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to spend their time and money defending themselves in a court of law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so that you can get some relatively cheap advertisement.
</em><br>
<p>You don't find the cryonics thesis compelling, so you feel put upon by
<br>
those who do, so you denigrate it with 'frivolous', 'stunt', and 'cheap
<br>
advertisement'.  This is exactly the attitude which makes the lawsuit
<br>
necessary.  I (and probably most cryonicists) don't denigrate the medical
<br>
profession, and I DEMAND the same respect.  If it takes a court of law to
<br>
accomplish that, then so be it.  And since the public nature of a lawsuit
<br>
serves to educate and inform the public about a life and death matter,
<br>
then, by design, it achieves a dual benefit.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By engaging in such activity, you are using a deficiency in our legal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system to destroy personal assets of those in the medical profession 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- - for advertising.  You have no real grounds for a case, yet you'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;force those medical professionals into court with their well-paid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lawyers just to maybe get a little TV time.
</em><br>
<p>More denigration stemming from your disrespect stemming from your failure
<br>
to understand cryonics.  Using the legal system to correct a vast,
<br>
life-destroying failure of vision, is hardly what I would call a deficiency
<br>
of the legal system. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As a related aside: Forcing others to help pay for your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advertisements is the tactic of spammers.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, dear god, oh, I am like unto a spammer, oh woe is me, where have I gone
<br>
wrong, I repent, please forgive me, aaaaagh!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why not do something legitimate, like pay for commercial advertising? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why not start a business selling body storage and advertise through 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infomercials?
</em><br>
<p>Good ideas, all.  In fact, if I hadn't just spent a couple of hours focused
<br>
on rebutting the points in your response to my original post, I would
<br>
probably enthusiastically agree, and spend a couple of hours enlarging on
<br>
the possibilities.  The lawsuit is an attack strategy, and has its
<br>
strengths.  Advertising, infotainment, entertainment, and commercial
<br>
enterprise have theirs.  I think I'll mostly leave the lawsuit to those
<br>
with a more combative nature.  I'm a lover not a fighter (though I recall a
<br>
playboy cartoon from the sixties where a ribbon-bedecked military man was
<br>
in bed with a babe, and the caption read, &quot;Make love AND war.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Thanks, Chris.  No hard feelings, or, as spike is wont to say,...&quot;bygones&quot;.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Chris puts it as &quot;ethics&quot;; I cast it in terms of practicality - 
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm.
<br>
<p>When I first read this, I saw your point and was inclined to agree.  If
<br>
they could make it fly, then as Mark Twain observed:
<br>
<p>There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it can be destroyed by
<br>
ridicule, howsoever poor and witless. Observe the ass, for instance: his
<br>
character is about perfect, he is the choicest spirit among all the humbler
<br>
animals, yet see what ridicule has brought him to. Instead of feeling
<br>
complimented when we are called an ass, we are left in doubt.
<br>
- Pudd'nhead Wilson 
<br>
<p>Ridicule is a powerful emotional tool, and has been used with great effect
<br>
to denigrate and marginalize cryonics.  But its application is also a
<br>
strategy which, when confronted with an appropriate counter-strategy, can
<br>
backfire.  Would attorneys, faced with sizeable damage claims, be
<br>
complacent?  Perhaps.  But they would certainly consider the overall
<br>
context, a context which would, at least at first, be set by the attorneys
<br>
for the plaintiffs. 
<br>
<p>Consider the following, which I wrote for a recent post to the cryonet:
<br>
<p>When making your case for cryonics, don't fail to mention the vast
<br>
potential for reducing human suffering.  Not only will ALL the depredations
<br>
of disease, injury, and aging be brought to a frozen standstill to
<br>
patiently await a reliably more favorable outcome (Contingent of course on
<br>
successful reanimation.  I won't go into here why I believe SUCCESS IS A
<br>
NEAR CERTAINTY.), but the benefits extend to every one of the everyday
<br>
people who then get to live in a world of vastly diminished human
<br>
suffering.  And don't forget the children.  I don't know about you, but I
<br>
know of nothing in the world more heart-rending than the horror of children
<br>
with cancer, surrounded by caregivers and family, who, themselves in the
<br>
utmost torment, have to pretend, for the sake of the kids, that life is not
<br>
a howling tragedy.  Remember the kids!]
<br>
<p>If the case is built on the reduction of human suffering, and you show the
<br>
faces of all those kids (not to mention all the other faces of suffering),
<br>
and the defense team tries to belittle you, and ridicule you, they might
<br>
very well come off as heartless monsters.  This sort of appeal to
<br>
prejudicial emotionalism might be controllable in the courtroom, but not in
<br>
the court of public opinion.  The media would eat it up.  They would like
<br>
nothing more than to play every angle for maximum air time (ie maximum
<br>
profit).  The crank cryonicists angle would certainly be appealing.  But
<br>
what about the rich heartless doctors and blood sucking lawyers as the
<br>
villians vs the white knight cryonicists defending the tragically suffering
<br>
children et al?  Which high drama makes the media cash registers ring
<br>
longer more fiercely?
<br>
<p>Tricky stuff this.  You make the call.
<br>
<p>Thanks Adrian.
