<em>&gt; &gt;Rock on, Mr. Nichols. Direct frontal assaults on belief systems always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;work. Err. Don't they?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interestingly, yes! 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You can't mean that part. Ever hear of Falun Gong? Ever hear of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Roman Empire's actions toward Christianity in the first few centuries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CE? Evidently imprisonment, torture and public execution aren't direct?
</em><br>
<p>Christianity was enforced at the point of a sword by Romans. 
<br>
Heresy was illegal until a couple of 100 years go. The conquisdors
<br>
and missionaries used bribery &amp; violence, not argument. Xianity is
<br>
unsustainable by intellectual argument alone, this is where it is
<br>
vulnerable .. by direct argument, and scientific refutation wherever 
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why should the voices of truth be silent?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Do what thou wilt. I'm for aikido, myself. I'm also an agnostic, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;God/god(s)&quot; is a squirmy concept with a lot of wiggle factor.
</em><br>
<p>Wiggle all you like .... but there is not a scrap of evidence for any of
<br>
the gods .... or do you have a way of verifying such mythology and lies?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Young children in particular will believe whatever is told to them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly by an adult, and even older folks will subconsciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept what is told to them, at least til their critical and analytic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faculties have time to kick in.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;And young people will often appear to rebel, and then fall back on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faiths of their fathers (or whatever their model of it is). 
</em><br>
<p>Are you just a human-era conservative apologist then? I am an
<br>
unashamed agent for change and extropian/post-human progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why kick the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;props out from under them? Why, for instance, try to deprive a terminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancer patient of her epiphany/notion that the world has a plan?
</em><br>
<p>Better to offer them the real prospect of cryogenics and of a
<br>
cure for cancer than delusory religious blather!!!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But sure, what are your suggestions for a &quot;sneak attack&quot; on Xian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalism?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I have no master plan, just a bunch of heuristics. You, on the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hand, have a master plan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I hope to pay attention to what works. You and I appear to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different attentions. This is OK; a sheaf of strategies is probably a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good idea. One-size-fits-all fits few. Things got the way they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because people have been the way they have been.
</em><br>
<p>Human supernaturalist beliefs systems are obsolete my friend.
<br>
Your agnostic stance is doomed to failure .... if you are going to
<br>
succeed in self-hypnotising yourself into religious ecstasy you
<br>
at least have to suspend critical faculties and disbelief in order
<br>
to throw yourself fully into the delusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have, in years past, sometimes thought that the final battle, if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comes, will not be between good and evil, but between the forces of good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the forces of good-and-evil-at-the-same-time. See Sowell's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;constrained&quot; vs. &quot;unconstrained&quot; visions.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Final battle&quot;, armageddon, religo-garbage gobbledegook. Also &quot;good&quot;
<br>
&quot;evil&quot; ultimate value judgement psychobabble ... get real. I won't see 
<br>
Sowell, he sounds a loser.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; MVT ... the all-conquering philosophy!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Umm. Right. I have delusions of _adequacy_, myself.
</em><br>
<p>All-conquering ... reductionist ... because true. Or are you
<br>
prepared to dispute with me? Ha! Your delusions of adequacy
<br>
are wholly unfounded unless you have a stronger view than MVT.
