<p>Thanks for the clarification.

<p>You're right. My use of the word &quot;obsession&quot; here was too strong, and
<br>
potentially inflammatory. Sorry. I was probably reacting more to what I
<br>
see as an unhealthy tendency on this list toward side-taking and us vs.
<br>
them posturing, rather than solid critical thinking, when it comes to
<br>
dealing with certain touchy political topics.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;How does this fit in with &quot;onward and upward&quot;? I see conflicting

<em>&gt; I'm missing the conflicting viewpoint you're talking about. By
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I was trying (not very successfully, apparently) to point out how I see
<br>
side-taking or thinking in oppositional terms to be anti-progess:
<br>
backward thinking, not forward thinking. This seems to conflict with
<br>
extropian thought. I was questioning your rhetorical methods, not the
<br>
content of the thing you were responding to.
