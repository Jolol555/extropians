1)
<br>
<p>There are a lot of good coders / IT people on this list. The best evidence
<br>
is when someone asks a computer related question; the barrage of responses
<br>
is quite overwhelming.
<br>
<p>I bet it's boring as batshit for those who don't earn a crust this way,
<br>
however.
<br>
<p>I've often wanted to ask tech questions on list, but hesitated because
<br>
that's not the list's purpose. I'm going out on a limb and assuming that
<br>
this is possibly not an uncommon experience.
<br>
<p>Should we (or someone) start an Extro IT self help list? So that all us
<br>
geekazoids can gather round, share knowledge, and beat each other over the
<br>
head on fine points of technical dogma? It'd be fun, and probably damned
<br>
useful.
<br>
<p>Any thoughts?
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
<p>The other thing this list is good at is answering science-related questions.
<br>
As an idea for positive PR, has anyone considered starting a website for
<br>
answering technical/science related questions, possibly aimed at younguns? A
<br>
lot of young people have questions to ask, and the people hereabouts answer
<br>
such questions in not only informative, but fairly entertaining ways.
<br>
<p>Such a site could be an amalgam of website based forum &amp; mailing list
<br>
(giving people the opportunity to access it in either style), and would
<br>
involve giving answers on a strictly voluntary basis (much as happens here
<br>
already). Think of it as a service to the community, and an excellent way to
<br>
increase exposure of extropian ideas which, after all, are supposed to be
<br>
driven by facts and reasonable predictions. The most common experience here
<br>
is that people come to &gt;H ideas by processing the information available to
<br>
them in their environment, and seek out Transhumanism or Extropianism after
<br>
they are already converts. So, to spread the word, we would be best served
<br>
in spreading information. And my bet is that the most likely demographic to
<br>
adopt these ideas of an amazingly changed future are young people; those
<br>
without much attachment to the way things are.
<br>
<p>Any thoughts?
<br>
