</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, I find this an interesting comment in light of a discussion that 
<br>
Barbara Lamar, Natasha and I have been having off-list regarding &quot;the Two 
<br>
Cultures&quot;, i.e. the famous divide between the humanities and arts on the one 
<br>
hand and the cultural world of science and technology on the other.  The 
<br>
passage from Damien's post you quote above is perfectly clear to me.  Perhaps 
<br>
this is because of which side of the &quot;Two Cultures&quot; divide I come from.  
<br>
Having spent a lifetime in study of literature, philosophy and history, I am 
<br>
used to thinking in the terms with which Damien expresses himself here.  
<br>
<p>In this passage Damien is expressing himself in terms of (really very slight) 
<br>
metaphor and analogy (&quot;barking our shins&quot;), two powerful tools in the kit of 
<br>
people who work on &quot;our&quot; side of the divide.  Interestingly, and apropos of 
<br>
the discussion we've been having off-list, Damien is actually addressing the 
<br>
subject of the divide itself in this passage, i.e. he is talking about the 
<br>
interaction of the empirical world with which science and technology is 
<br>
concerned (&quot;the Real&quot;) and the world of subjective experience which is the 
<br>
main object of works of &quot;symbol and culture&quot;.  Ironically, I think the point 
<br>
that Damien was making was that clever self-reference - which he took the 
<br>
solution to your riddle to be - is in fact corrosive of the value of 
<br>
grounding dialogue in the empirical world of barked shins and repeatable 
<br>
experiment.  I think his larger point (the whole book from he quotes is 
<br>
making its way to the top of my list) is that a pragmatic judgment from 
<br>
utility in the empirical world ultimately drains the quagmire of self-doubt 
<br>
and self-reference to which so much of modern &quot;culture&quot; has been reduced by 
<br>
the practice of post-modernist &quot;deconstruction&quot;.  Ultimately, Damien is 
<br>
working to bridge the chasm between &quot;the Two Cultures&quot;.  So I think you 
<br>
should try again to make out what he's talking about.
