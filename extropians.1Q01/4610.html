Subj:   TO THE PRODUCERS OF &quot;Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?&quot;
<br>
Date:   2/24/01
<br>
To: <a href="mailto:askfox@foxinc.com?Subject=Re:%20FOX%20Moon-Hoax%20Anomaly%20Debunked&In-Reply-To=&lt;8f.74adb4c.27c8fabc@aol.com&gt;">askfox@foxinc.com</a>
<br>
<p>On February 15, 2001, your network aired a television program entitled 
<br>
&quot;Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?.&quot;  With this act, you have 
<br>
reached a new low in the business of popular culture.  This program, which 
<br>
featured the absurd and easily-debunked delusions of a handful of cranks and 
<br>
crackpots, is an insult to the 12 brave men who walked on the moon, the 
<br>
brilliant and difficult work of all the other men and women who made that 
<br>
accomplishment possible and the ultimate price paid by the three heroes who 
<br>
died in the Apollo 1 fire.
<br>
<p>We live in the most free society on Earth.  You are fortunate to have the 
<br>
choice to broadcast whatever you wish to the world.  However, you seem to 
<br>
forget that with freedom comes responsibility.  In the pursuit of a momentary 
<br>
benefit - the miniscule margin of increased profit that airing the offensive 
<br>
material in this &quot;documentary&quot; might have given you - you have chosen to 
<br>
neglect any notion of journalistic responsibility and explore previously 
<br>
unknown realms of television garbage.  The American public is already 
<br>
woefully ignorant of science and its own history.  By providing an unbalanced 
<br>
forum to the morons who promote this &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; about one of our 
<br>
country's greatest achievements, you have done your part to further this 
<br>
alarming trend.
<br>
<p>Congratulations, Fox.  Sleep well in the knowledge that you have done your 
<br>
part to &quot;dumb down&quot; your fellow citizens just a little more.
<br>
<p>Greg Burch
