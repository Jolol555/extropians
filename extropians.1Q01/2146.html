<em>&gt; Heh.  Seriously, people who have been using Oracle for years usually don't

</em><br>

<p>I have refused to learn PL/SQL or SQL*Plus any other single db vendor
<br>
proprietary language.  The world does not need this and I certainly
<br>
don't.  I don't mind learning a specialized language for database if it
<br>
works on all vendor's products of a particular class.  I occassionally
<br>
learn just enough to write an adaptor to something of my own invention
<br>
that is more general.  But I believe I do my customers and employers a
<br>
disservice if I write their business logic directly in some vendor
<br>
proprietary language.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other thing you need to learn is SQL*Plus.  This is a pain, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.  PL/SQL lets you do what you want, but SQL*Plus sets up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment and controls the scripts.  But it isn't as important to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SQL*Plus very well as it is to learn PL/SQL very well; if you don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PL/SQL, you are missing out on a significant portion of the functionality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Oracle.  When everything is set up right and you know what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing, you end up with a relatively rich scripting environment that allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to build your own components and tools in a fashion similar to Unix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Oracle should be a vendor of relational dbms technology not busy locking
<br>
you in to having persistent solutions that work only on Oracle and are
<br>
useless on anything else.
