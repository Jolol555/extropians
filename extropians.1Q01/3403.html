Dreeeam ON! inthe final analysis, the party with the 
<br>
biggest/best/most weapons does what it wants to do. Right now that's 
<br>
the US gov't. If they want it, they'll take it. Period. True, the 
<br>
nature of wealth and its fluidity is making governments more 
<br>
vulnerable to the will of the wealth--but when push comes to shove, 
<br>
it's weapons that matter. Unless the &quot;private&quot; owners control or 
<br>
leverage the weapons or the governments which deploy them--no private 
<br>
ownership.

&gt; I scanned your post thrice and found nothing the least bit pessimistic
&gt; anywhere.  The analysis is right on, in fact if anything you understated
&gt; your case Adrian.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I can see, the first person who gets to Mars to stay
&gt; owns Mars, all of it.  Or at least as far as her gun can fire.  Like
&gt; it or hate it, Mars will eventually be converted entirely into
&gt; private property, immune from hassle from the blue planet.  spike
