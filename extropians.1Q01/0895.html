<p>It shouldn't take more than a few minutes of reflection to realize that
<br>
a copyright date only refers to publication. I have no idea how long
<br>
Robert was cooking this up. Why don't you ask him? Some people take
<br>
decades before they publish. It all depends.
<br>
<p>My guess is that Mr. Joy's media attention certainly had some effect on
<br>
completion and publication.

<p>OK, so you don't like Freitas having a penchant for neologisms. Hardly a
<br>
fundamental flaw in the work, it seems to me. The title was already
<br>
really long.
<br>
<p>The issue of what countermeasures would work after notice of the problem
<br>
is definitely worth further exploration. Why don't you work up something
<br>
for publication?
