<br>
<p>TONGA, a monarchy, is no cradle of
<br>
democracy. The U.S. holiday today is also the
<br>
king's birthday. But on this Fourth of July,
<br>
the multi-island nation in the South Pacific
<br>
will mark another kind of milestone, a move
<br>
toward leapfrogging the developed world in its
<br>
telecommunications.
<br>
<p>Dewayne Hendricks will be there. The longtime
<br>
Silicon Valley resident is leading the project
<br>
to deploy a nationwide wireless network based
<br>
on Internet communications standards. If it
<br>
works as planned, Tonga's 100,000 residents
<br>
will end up with a system that combines voice,
<br>
video and data running at data-transfer speeds
<br>
that the rest of the world will envy.
<br>
<p>For Hendricks, Tonga is a proving ground for
<br>
wireless technology he and his colleagues
<br>
believe could shatter the status quo
<br>
here. It's also an example of what he calls
<br>
``regulatory activism,'' working inside and
<br>
outside the system to make changes.
<br>
<p>Dave Farber, chief technologist at the Federal
<br>
Communications Commission, is intrigued by
<br>
Hendricks' work. ``He is trying to advance the
<br>
field and show the world what can be done when
<br>
regulation is relaxed and technology tried,''
<br>
Farber says.
<br>
<p>Why Tonga? It's a monarchy, for one
<br>
thing. When the royal family decides to do
<br>
something, it doesn't have to convene a
<br>
committee.
<br>
<p>The nation also has an aging and inadequate
<br>
telecommunications infrastructure, but not
<br>
enough money to repair and upgrade the
<br>
wire-based system. There is plenty of demand
<br>
-- an eight-year wait for phone service,
<br>
Hendricks notes.  Without regulatory
<br>
restraints or ``legacy systems,'' there's a
<br>
great opportunity to start from scratch.
<br>
<p>Hendricks, who started his technology career
<br>
in mainframe programming in the 1970s, has
<br>
been working with wireless Internet access for
<br>
years. He and his colleagues are convinced
<br>
that what's called an ultra-wideband,
<br>
fixed-wireless communications system can
<br>
provide the backbone for Tonga's future
<br>
needs. For more information on the technology
<br>
they're using, check out the Web site for the
<br>
Dandin Group (www.dandin.com), which is headed
<br>
by Hendricks and is the lead contractor to
<br>
Tonga's national phone system for the project.
<br>
<p>Since 1996, Hendricks has had the technology
<br>
running here. He put up antennas on Mount
<br>
Allison, which is in a line of sight to his
<br>
Fremont home. About 30 people in the Bay Area
<br>
are connecting wirelessly to the Net via the
<br>
system, he said -- and some of them are
<br>
influential in the technology field.
<br>
<p>Enter the crown prince of Tonga. He'd been
<br>
wanting to upgrade the nation's
<br>
telecommunications capabilities, Hendricks
<br>
said, and he heard about the network through
<br>
the tech grapevine. He visited Silicon Valley,
<br>
liked what he saw and decided to give it a
<br>
try.
<br>
<p>Today marks the beginning of a transition in
<br>
Tonga, the handoff of the old licensing system
<br>
to the new one. ``We'll be able to start
<br>
construction of our satellite ground
<br>
stations,'' Hendricks says. By the end of the
<br>
year, he expects to have completed part of the
<br>
overall project's mobile-communications
<br>
component.
<br>
<p>So what does Tonga have to do with the United
<br>
States? Plenty, if Hendricks gets his way.
<br>
<p>For one thing, he's planning to install
<br>
similar systems on Native American lands in
<br>
North America -- places that are notoriously
<br>
and shamefully underserved by our
<br>
telecommunications industry. Three pilot
<br>
projects are slated to start this fall.
<br>
<p>``What I try to do is go to places that don't
<br>
have incumbency issues,'' he says, referring
<br>
to the way existing telecom companies always
<br>
try to thwart new ideas that they can't
<br>
dominate themselves.
<br>
<p>Proving the concept will create demand, he
<br>
believes. That, in turn, will make it
<br>
difficult for regulators and industry to block
<br>
the development of new technologies that
<br>
threaten the status quo.
<br>
<p>Hendricks isn't doing this solely because he
<br>
believes it's a good idea, of course. He
<br>
stands to make plenty of money if everything
<br>
works as he expects.
<br>
<p>But by working the inside and outside the
<br>
system -- inside, he's a member of the FCC's
<br>
Telecommunications Advisory Committee and
<br>
calls himself a ``wireless wonk'' -- Hendricks
<br>
is striving to achieve some worthy goals. I
<br>
hope he succeeds.
