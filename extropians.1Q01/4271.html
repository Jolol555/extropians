Damien forwards from <a href="http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGAKYLXFDJC.html">http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGAKYLXFDJC.html</a>:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Claims by some scientists that humans in this century will have a life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectancy of 100 or even 120 are not realistic and not supported by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trends measuring the rates of death, said S. Jay Olshansky of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; University of Illinois, Chicago. 
</em><br>
<p>We've had some discussions previously about these trend-based analyses.
<br>
Robin posted a reference last year,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Age-specific mortality rates have fallen at a steady exponential rate for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the entire last century.  The classic source on this is
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modeling and Forecasting U. S. Mortality, by Ronald D. Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence R. Carter, J. American Statistical Association,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87(419):659-671, Sep., 1992.
<br>
<p>It is true that if you extrapolate this century-long exponential trend
<br>
forward you get the results of Olshansky.
<br>
<p>I think we need to challenge the validity of exponential extrapolations
<br>
as a guide to future changes.  My bet is that if you could look at most
<br>
data sets over a longer period, you would find that steady exponential
<br>
changes are NOT a good guide.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have much specific evidence for this, but an
<br>
excellent example is population growth.  Robin has an analysis at
<br>
<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.html</a> which shows that population growth
<br>
has gone through a series of exponential curves.  Some have lasted for
<br>
millennia, others decades.  In each case we saw an exponential curve go
<br>
through a &quot;phase transition&quot; to a new curve with a higher exponent and
<br>
more rapid change.
<br>
<p>My guess is that the same thing will happen with age specific mortality.
<br>
We will enter a new regime in which the decreases in the past of about
<br>
1% per year in mortality may increase to 10% or more per year due to
<br>
a breakthrough in knowledge.  Biology researchers often claim that the
<br>
advent of genomics will be so dramatic as to represent a new paradigm
<br>
for knowledge growth, so a breakthrough is plausible.
<br>
<p>Such a decline in mortality rates would drastically increase lifespan.
<br>
If we could hit the 10% mark, then every 8 years mortality would decline
<br>
over 50%, which would roughly counteract the age-related doubling of
<br>
mortality every 8 years (figures from Curt Adams) and give us indefinite
<br>
lifespan.
<br>
<p>Given that long term change is a series of exponential curves with
<br>
increasing exponents, and that we are on the verge of a breakthrough
<br>
in biological understanding according to the researchers involved, it
<br>
is entirely reasonable to project that we will see an increase in the
<br>
rate of mortality improvement, even though it has been constant for the
<br>
past century.
<br>
<p>The question, then, is how valid is the model of piecewise exponential
<br>
growth, over a range of data?  Are there other examples than population
<br>
which have been analyzed over a long period and where this model applies?
<br>
Or contrariwise are there examples where we have seen steady exponential
<br>
growth no matter how far back we look?
<br>
