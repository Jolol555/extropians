<p>In what way is a flan in the face comparable to rape?

<br>
<em>&gt; You just don't get it.  When someone does something physically to you

</em><br>
<p>You are taking an absolutist position: that *any* physical act is morally
<br>
and practically equivalent to the most serious conceivable physical act.
<br>
<p>I do not buy that position. It is self-evidently wrong. (*Why* it appears
<br>
self-evidently wrong to me is an interesting issue that I need to go
<br>
and think about.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Can you cope with people mocking you publicly, if they don't lay so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;as an air molecule on your person?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, I have no problem with that.  When someone mocks me publicly, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're not impeding me or attacking me physically.  They have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to mock me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By your logic, if someone is mocking me and I don't like it, I should 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; huh?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Nope. Go shove the pie in his face yourself. Don't be surprised if they
<br>
shove one right back at you, too.
<br>
<p>Look, think of it as one point on a continuum:
<br>
<p>* You don't object to someone mocking you verbally.
<br>
<p>* Suppose someone dresses up as a mime and follows you around, apeing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;your movements and taking the piss. Is *that* harmful?
<br>
<p>* (cream pie goes here)
<br>
<p>* Someone follows you around and tries to throw a plate full of feces
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in your face. They've been considerate enough to nuke any bacteria
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in it first, but it still stinks. (I think we both agree that this 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*isn't* a nice thing to do, but it is unlikely to prove fatal.)
<br>
<p>* Someone tries to shoot you. (Unequivocally bad.)
<br>
<p>This continuum runs from forms of criticism that are harmless to forms of
<br>
criticism that are lethal.
<br>
<p>Now, as far as I can tell, your position is that there should be no
<br>
difference in response to being groped v.s. a serious rape attack: they're
<br>
both bad and evil. By extension, there should be no difference in response
<br>
to a pie in the face, or a hand grenade.
<br>
<p>(Is that an accurate characterisation of your view?)
<br>
<p>My point of view is simply that the response should be proportional to 
<br>
any perceived threat, and that treating a cream pie in the face the
<br>
same way as a pistol (or a plateful of turds) is silly.
