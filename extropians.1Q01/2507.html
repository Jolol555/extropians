</em><br>
<p>For some time now, I've had a similar idea, inspired by the internet. Rewire
<br>
all the country to run on electronic transactions. Abolish cash. Then charge
<br>
5% per transaction for government services, and there you are. :-)
<br>
<p>But the thing is, you probably wouldn't collect nearly as much money this
<br>
way as the government currently collects through taxes. If a person has a
<br>
monthly throughput of 100 monetary units, the government currently taxes
<br>
away between 30 and 60 monetary units, depending on where you live. (Income
<br>
taxes + value added tax + ...) If you had a contract tax, or a transaction
<br>
tax, the government would only collect something like 5 monetary units. But
<br>
then, one *could* increase the transaction tax to 30-60%... And with such a
<br>
large tax, you then have to enforce it. If people had a choice, like in your
<br>
scheme, they would probably prefer to hire some thugs to enforce their
<br>
contract rather than pay 30-60% to have the government do it.
<br>
<p>But you do raise a good point:
<br>
<p>What would a country be like, if it charged for its services directly,
<br>
rather than through a budget? One would enumerate all services that the
<br>
government provides to the citizens, and then citizens would be charged for
<br>
use of these services according to how much they use them, when they use
<br>
them. Of course, some services would still have to be &quot;subscription-based&quot;,
<br>
but I think many could be transformed into a pay-per-use schema.
<br>
Additionally, distinct government operations would have to cover their
<br>
expenses on their own, with no help from a central budget.
<br>
<p>I think such a schema would significantly increase the efficiency of a
<br>
government, because there would be direct feedback between the service
<br>
provider and the service user.
<br>
<p>I remember hearing about research that is supposed to have shown that
<br>
operations which are funded from a budget, i.e. with no financial feedback
<br>
from users, are only about 50% as efficient as those services which are
<br>
funded directly. If anyone can confirm this or deny this, I would appreciate
<br>
it. It certainly seems like this is true from where I live.
<br>
<p>Also, if there is a future president reading this list, make sure to think
<br>
about this seriously. I'd love to implement such changes, but I'll only be
<br>
able to do this in Slovenia - unless the USA changes its constitution to
<br>
allow me to become president over there. [Perhaps I can do both - could I
<br>
telecommute to DC? :-) ]
<br>
