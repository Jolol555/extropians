<em>&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll play. Obviously I think raising and harvesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; engineered disencephalatic clones is going to be a slightly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; difficult proposition than planting weed seeds in dirt.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Do you think that it is actually desirable or preferable that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nation/state will decide which technologies you can and can't use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in your attempts to continue to live and advance?  Or merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inevitable? 
</em><br>
<p>Inevitable, but we are not without influence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you think that it is not preferable then by what means or what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do you propose to escape being limited by the votes of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;majority or the edict of this or that politician in these matters? 
</em><br>
<p>I think by being aware of the general public's reaction to things,
<br>
and avoiding the most dramatic (microencephalic parts clones) while
<br>
emphasizing the positive aspects of the technology. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ethics involving clones and associated technology is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting topic. It short circuits it to say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nation/state will decide and simply stop there.
</em><br>
<p>I was not trying to short-circuit the discussion, in fact
<br>
(confession time) I was playing DA (devil's advocate) to a degree
<br>
to promote it. (blame my college philosophy prof)
<br>
<p>Obviously a clone of a human being is also a human being, but there
<br>
are those who don't think so. The February WIRED once again
<br>
feature's cloning as it's cover story.
<br>
<p>I'm concerned about people like the one lady in the article who has
<br>
preserved a few inches of her son's skin (he died in an accident)
<br>
with the hope of &quot;bringing him back&quot;. I can see her naming a
<br>
potential clone the same name, attempting to recreate her missing
<br>
son, and being upset if it's not exactly alike.
<br>
<p>I think enough children are misunderstood and abused in this world
<br>
without creating more.
<br>
<p>These people need to understand the facts. No clone will even be
<br>
exactly alike genetically, and they most certainly will not have
<br>
the personnality of the original.
<br>
<p>They will be people, not Xerox copies.
<br>
<p>I think if this was better understood people would be less afraid. 
<br>
<p>I also worry that people who now insist on reliving their lives
<br>
vicariously through their children will see this (cloning) as an
<br>
even more likely possibility.
