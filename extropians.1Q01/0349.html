<p>Michael Kandel sparklingly translated this Lem book, and some others. He is
<br>
in consequence greatly admired among [those few] literary folks who enjoy
<br>
both sf and good writing. Other Lem work had been execrably rendered (*The
<br>
Invincible*, e.g.). Kandel confessedly does not try to find an English
<br>
equivalent for every Polish word; he seeks to convey the spirit of the
<br>
original text in the best and closest available English. My pal George
<br>
Zebrowski, who grew up lucid in Polish and knows Kandel (who learned Polish
<br>
as an adult), says he finds some of Kandel's renderings forced and on
<br>
occasion simply wrong due to ignorance. Ah well. I don't care that much,
<br>
because Kandel's work is such fun.
<br>
<p>As for Hofstadter and Onegin: this reminds me of the famous row between the
<br>
great American critic Edmund Wilson, and Vladimir Nabokov. Wilson also
<br>
taught himself Russian to translate Pushkin and others; Nabokov, whose
<br>
family had escaped from Russia early (and who'd grown up, like Hofstadter,
<br>
fluent in French and English), denounced Wilson's translations - and yet
<br>
many Russians found Nabokov's own Russian encrusted with a sort of
<br>
stuck-in-amber Edwardian floridity, a bit like the English translations of
<br>
Tolstoy by Constance Garnett. 
<br>
<p>Thanks to Amara for those delightful reflections of poetic form (and
<br>
content). It's nice to see something on this list from the other side of
<br>
the great cultural divide, especially from a professional astronomer. :)
