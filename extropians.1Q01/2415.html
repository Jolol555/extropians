<p>
Books like Richard Pipes' &quot;Property and Freedom&quot; which I recently reviewed 
<br>
here, Francis Fukuyama's &quot;Trust&quot; (which I also highly commend) and Hernando 
<br>
de Soto's &quot;The Mystery of Capital&quot; (which has been recommended to me in 
<br>
response to my review of Pipes' book) all point to a core connection between 
<br>
deep cultural histories of respect for individual and property rights and 
<br>
contemporary success for those societies that possess such histories.  My 
<br>
almost-daily dose of BBC radio news, with its reporting on the dismal reality 
<br>
of politics in the developing world, leads me to a near-constant rumination 
<br>
on the question of how such deeply flawed societies can find a path out of 
<br>
their current traps of corruption and self-inflicted violence.
<br>
<p>The standard libertarian response that developing countries need to discard 
<br>
powerful state controls to liberate the power of individual self-governance 
<br>
and enterprise don't satisfy me as anything like a complete prescription for 
<br>
the on-going, slow-motion disaster that is the equatorial world's response to 
<br>
the challenges of modernity.  Both Pipes and Fukuyama (and apparently de 
<br>
Soto) make it clear that the chronically poor regions of the world continue 
<br>
to be so because they lack a broad and deep culture of respect for individual 
<br>
autonomy and property rights and possess cultures which discourage the kind 
<br>
of voluntary bonds of trust upon which development can build.  The reflexive 
<br>
surrender to authority, be it at a tribal or ethnic level or at a &quot;national&quot; 
<br>
level to leaders like Saddam Hussein or religious zealots like the Taliban 
<br>
spiritual thugs who now rule Afghanistan, seems to be driven by deep cultural 
<br>
tendencies that predate any simple notion of &quot;state control&quot;.  The problem is 
<br>
clearly both more complex and more memetically ingrained than the modern idea 
<br>
or practice of state authority.
<br>
<p>To ask Lenin's question, &quot;what is to be done&quot;?  Addressing this problem, 
<br>
which afflicts the vast majority of human beings alive right now, seems to me 
<br>
to be a challenge that transhumanists in general and extropians in particular 
<br>
can't avoid.  The prospect of equipping people driven by tribal ethnic 
<br>
passions and who do not possess ingrained cultural restraints derived from 
<br>
respect for individual autonomy and private property with the technologies of 
<br>
the mid-21st century is surely the greatest threat to our survival, whether 
<br>
&quot;we&quot; are conceived as the human species as it is, as it may be, or simply as 
<br>
individuals who want to experience the wonders that lie ahead.
<br>
<p>I don't presume to have an answer to this question, but one thing I know 
<br>
won't help us find solutions is the more potent form of &quot;cultural 
<br>
relativism&quot;, which prohibits the passing of judgments on cultures different 
<br>
from our own.  I'm all for debating and exploring the foundations of moral 
<br>
judgment and, as I've written here before, have ideas of my own about how it 
<br>
can be that a person can rigorously make moral judgments that have real 
<br>
effect in the real world.  Without the time to get into a full-fledged 
<br>
description of those ideas, suffice it to say I believe that the power of 
<br>
18th century - really 17th century - &quot;natural law&quot; theories can be salvaged 
<br>
from any foundation in supernatural authority.  Instead, I think that 
<br>
game-theoretic insights gained from structures like the iterated prisoners' 
<br>
dilemma provide a path to a potent new formulation of natural law and a 
<br>
theory of natural rights.  
<br>
<p>In this connection, I'm currently reading Richard Epstein's book &quot;Principles 
<br>
for a Free Society: Reconciling Individual Liberty with the Common Good&quot;, 
<br>
which seems to be pointing to a consequentialist, utilitarian rationale for 
<br>
the basic moral foundations upon which the original natural law theorists 
<br>
grounded their ideas.  His discussion of the prisoners' dilemma unfortunately 
<br>
seems to be an afterthought, rather than a fundamental analytical tool.  It 
<br>
seems he is unaware of the powerful insights provided from iteration of the 
<br>
classical prisoners' dilemma, although he ALMOST works it out on his own.  At 
<br>
this point, I would look to his analysis as a happy consequence of 
<br>
application of &quot;natural&quot; respect for individual autonomy and property rights, 
<br>
rather than a sustainable theoretic foundation.
<br>
<p>Theoretical concerns aside, I believe that the weakness engendered by 
<br>
cultural relativism poses a fundamental threat to survival over the coming 
<br>
decades.  Some cultural values and practices WORK in the modern world and 
<br>
others don't.  Some tend toward peace and prosperity, and others tend toward 
<br>
violence and poverty.  Not only do we have to be able to SAY this, we have to 
<br>
be able to ACT on this realization.
