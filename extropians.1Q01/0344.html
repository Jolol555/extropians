1:
<br>
One box is big, the other is small.
<br>
<p>The keyhole in the big box is larger than the key to the smaller box. So, I
<br>
pick up the larger box, shake it around a bit, till the key to the smaller
<br>
box falls out through the keyhole of the larger box. Click, clack, and we
<br>
are done.
<br>
<p>2:
<br>
The big box is big and heavy. The small box is frail. I use the big box to
<br>
smash the small box, extract the key from the wreckage, open the big box.
<br>
<p>Alternative; it's a hardcopy version of The Spike, suitable for box
<br>
smashing.
<br>
<p>3:
<br>
Ah hah! Thought of this while typing the other two.
<br>
One box is the room we are in, with a locked door; the other is a little box
<br>
in the floor. The key to the little box is on the floor, the key to the
<br>
larger one is in the little box.
<br>
<p><pre>
----
<p>Actually, I think the box-smashing answer is the most likely to work.

&gt; I previously wrote:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Ok, try this one:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      There are two locked boxes, an old and younger brother;
&gt; &gt;      The keys to each, are inside the other;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      To cheer up the ozzy, I leave a copy of 'The Spike';
&gt; &gt;      Of which you're free to use, in any way you like;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      To keep him smiling, I promise no meta-tricks;
&gt; &gt;      No Eliezer Yudkowsky's, xgl's, or tooth picks;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      Now all that remains, is for me to ask;
&gt; &gt;      How do I open each box, and complete the task?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's actually quite an easy one. I request that Eliezer and xgl sit this
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; out to give others a shot at it. You're both free to respond privately
&gt; &gt; though.
&gt;
&gt; I expected someone would guess this pretty quickly, but only Eliezer has
&gt; attempted it. He gave the following answer:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;1)  Take the key from A.
&gt; &gt;2)  Using the key from A, unlock B.
&gt; &gt;3)  Take the key from B.
&gt; &gt;4)  Using the key from B, unlock A.  Be sure to do this before Step 1.
&gt;
&gt; While technically correct in a minimal sense, I can't declare him winner
&gt; because he does not explain how the apparent paradox was evaded. I need a
&gt; glowing lightbulb 'aha!' type answer. I'm pretty sure Damien would have
&gt; roasted me otherwise.
&gt;
&gt; Here's a couple of clues: The boxes are real wooden boxes with locks built
&gt; into them, but they are not the same size.
&gt;
&gt; Only the first 2 lines are really relevant to the puzzle. They rest is
&gt; mainly to distract you and to tease Damien.
&gt;
&gt; Eli &amp; xgl: feel free to join in publically.
&gt;
&gt; Apologies to anyone who maybe found the puzzle added to the noise. I will
&gt; post the solution next Friday and be done with it.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Dale Johnstone.
&gt; AI Researcher.
