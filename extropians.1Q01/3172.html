Of the many things claimed to increase maximum lifespan, calorie
<br>
restriction with adequate nutrition (CRAN) probably has the strongest
<br>
scientific backing.  However, this review suggests that very few of the
<br>
people who attempt to lose even modest amounts of weight  will be able
<br>
to keep it off long term. 
<br>
<p>One interesting passages reviews experiments done to see how difficult
<br>
it would be to achieve the opposite goal--to _increase_ someone's
<br>
weight:
<br>
<p>&quot;     Just as the body resists weight loss by making metabolic
<br>
adjustments, it also resists gain.  In a classic experiment,
<br>
prisoners volunteered to gain between 20% and 25% of their
<br>
original body weight by eating about twice their usual caloric
<br>
intake for about 6 months (Sims, Goldman, Gluck et al., 1968). 
<br>
Most of the men gained the initial few pounds with ease but
<br>
quickly became hypermetabolic and resisted further weight gain
<br>
despite continued overfeeding (Sims, 1976).  One prisoner stopped
<br>
gaining weight even though he was consuming close to 10,000
<br>
calories per day.  With return to normal amounts of food, most of
<br>
the men returned to the weight levels that they had maintained
<br>
prior to the experiment.&quot;

<p><p><p>CONFRONTING THE FAILURE OF BEHAVIORAL AND DIETARY TREATMENTS FOR
<br>
OBESITY
<br>
<p>By GARNER, D.M. and WOLLEY, S.C. (1991)
<br>
<p>Clinical Psychology Review, 11, 729-780
<br>
<p><p>INTRODUCTION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been over a decade since two major reviews questioned
<br>
the effectiveness and social appropriateness of behavioral
<br>
treatments for obesity (Stunkard &amp; Penick, 1979; Wooley, Wooley,
<br>
&amp; Dyrenforth, 1979a).  Other papers and books have since appeared
<br>
challenging the basic precepts which underlie dietary treatments
<br>
for obesity (Bennett, 1984, 1987; Bennett &amp; Gurin, 1982;
<br>
Ernsberger &amp; Haskew, 1987; Fitzgerald, 1981; Foreyt, Goodrick, &amp;
<br>
Gotto, 1981; Krieshok &amp; Karpowitz, 1988; Wooley &amp; Wooley, 1982,
<br>
1984; Wooley, Wooley, &amp; Dyrenforth, 1979b).  Their arguments,
<br>
however, have not been embraced, accepted, or in many cases, even
<br>
addressed by the mainstream of behavioral scientists and health
<br>
care professionals who treat obesity.  It is still widely held
<br>
within the health care professions that obesity confers
<br>
significant health risks warranting weight reduction.  Weight
<br>
loss as a means for achieving health and happiness is vigorously
<br>
promoted by the commercial weight loss industry, now a major
<br>
economic force in North America.   
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behavioral or dietary treatments for mild and moderate
<br>
obesity1 continue to be advocated despite weak and often
<br>
conflicting epidemiological data suggesting that these levels of
<br>
obesity are linked to significant health risks (cf. Mann, 1974;
<br>
Ernsberger &amp; Haskew, 1987), and despite overwhelming evidence
<br>
from controlled studies that weight loss programs are ineffective
<br>
in producing lasting weight change (cf. Bennett, 1987; Stunkard &amp;
<br>
Penick, 1979).  One can point to behavioral programs for weight
<br>
control recommended in the same publications which document
<br>
physiological resistances to weight change, seemingly without
<br>
recognition of the contradictions or problems involved in trying
<br>
to override the body's biological regulatory mechanisms.  Our
<br>
failure to fully confront these issues has meant that, despite
<br>
new knowledge, there has been no fundamental change in our
<br>
practices.  Old diets with new names, such as the &quot;set point
<br>
diet&quot; seem almost to parody the efforts of scientists to
<br>
understand the causes of obesity and provide treatments
<br>
consistent with this understanding. Another expository review of
<br>
obesity treatment studies is unnecessary since the topic has been
<br>
comprehensively reviewed elsewhere (Bennett, 1986; Brownell,
<br>
1982; Brownell &amp; Wadden, 1986; Foreyt, 1977; Foreyt et al., 1981;
<br>
Jeffery, 1987; Stunkard &amp; Mahoney, 1976; Wilson &amp; Brownell,
<br>
1980).  Instead, the primary aim of this paper is to provide an
<br>
evaluative and integrative appraisal of weight loss treatments
<br>
within the context of what is known about:  1. long-term
<br>
treatment efficacy, 2) the biology of weight regulation,  3)
<br>
eating patterns of the obese,  4) the genetic determinants of
<br>
obesity and  5) the health risks associated with obesity.  In
<br>
view of this evidence, it will be argued that mental health
<br>
professionals should, under most circumstances, be advised
<br>
against the delivery of dietary or behavioral treatments for mild
<br>
or moderate obesity rather than proposing more aggressive dietary
<br>
approaches (Brownell &amp; Jeffery, 1987).  When weight reduction is
<br>
offered, consumers should be given complete information regarding
<br>
risks and probable outcome.  Rather than expending further
<br>
resources on traditional treatments of obesity, health
<br>
professionals should be encouraged to further develop alternative
<br>
approaches that more adequately address the physical,
<br>
psychological, and social hazards associated with obesity without
<br>
requiring dieting or weight loss.
