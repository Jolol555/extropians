<p>Eliezer, Minsky was the same guy who was the dinner speaking at the
<br>
first west coast Foresight Nanocon, which was in about 1990 or 91.
<br>
He dismissed solar sailing by claiming that even if nanotech could produce a
<br>
sheet of aluminum a single atom thick, then the gravitational force of the
<br>
sun would be greater than the light pressure from the sun, and that since
<br>
both fields fall off as the inverse square of the distance, solar gravity is
<br>
greater than solar light pressure everywhere.  K. Eric Drexler was standing
<br>
next to me when the comment was made.  We looked at each other
<br>
as if to say &quot;Are you gonna let him get away with THAT?&quot;  Neither of
<br>
us said anything, nor did anyone else, but his credibility dropped about
<br>
20dB.  An aluminum sheet about 600 atoms thick would balance light
<br>
pressure and gravity, if my calcs are right.  Had we the intestinal fortitude
<br>
of Robert Bradbury, we would have shouted in unison &quot;THATS NOT
<br>
TRUE!&quot;    We would have looked like this:  ---&gt;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}8^O
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}8^O
<br>
<p>Those of us who have met you in the flesh know you to be a gentleman
<br>
and a scholar.   In the words of a famous Jew: &quot;turn the other cheek.&quot;  spike
