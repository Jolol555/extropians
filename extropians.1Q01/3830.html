<em>&gt; &gt; As others have pointed out, the inherent gender-inequality of criminal

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crime.  That said, I personally think reform of contemporary criminal law and

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and penal systems are horribly broken and counterproductive.
</em><br>
<p>While the violent prison population is primarily male dominated, in
<br>
actual crimes committed, women are almost as prevalent as men. Women
<br>
tend to focus though on non-violent crimes (shoplifting esp.), tend to
<br>
be far more sanguine and intelligent about comitting them (they don't
<br>
hawk their wares, don't brag to buddies or spouses) and so are caught
<br>
less frequently (there being far less focus on catching and prosecuting
<br>
crimes committed by women than men) and when they are caught are far
<br>
more frequently let off or given light, short sentences. Shoplifting,
<br>
for example, is a crime that is almost universally committed by teenage
<br>
girls one or more times (and many adult women, as well, important women,
<br>
even), such that 'hacking' store security devices seems to be common
<br>
knowledge among many women in their 20's, in my experience.
<br>
Women commit more domestic violence, according to survey data, that is
<br>
not reflected in criminal prosecution, which indicates a severe level of
<br>
underreporting by male victims, an unsurprising result given the total
<br>
lack of respect that society in general and law enforcment in particular
<br>
give to male victims of domestic violence.
<br>
<p>It stands to reason that one man in jail for ten years for his third
<br>
felony assault will cause the exact same level of prison crowding as
<br>
twenty women spending 6 months in jail for shoplifting.
