<p><p>It depends very much on the individual child.  All children are no more
<br>
exactly alike in what they respond to than are all adults.  Relative
<br>
sweetness and light works with some children and works much better than
<br>
anything else.  Other children need a firmer approach.  And yes, for
<br>
some children that includes even corporal punishment judiciously
<br>
applied.  I know some will not wish to accept that under any
<br>
circumstances and no, I can't prove it.  But it seems to hold in my
<br>
(admittedly limited) experience.

<em>&gt; &gt;No, baby does not HAVE to be left in her crib to cry. This is

<em>&gt; &gt;something you choose to do to her.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't it be more appropriate to say that this is how you have chosen
<br>
to react to her crying in these particular circumstances?  This is much
<br>
less biased language. Parents/caretakers and children are in a bit of a
<br>
mutual training loop.  The flow is not one-way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, when our daughter cried upon being put to bed at certain times,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we let her cry for a bit before going to bed.  Training her to go to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bed at a certain time early on means that she's now very reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about knowing her limits concerning bedtime.  
</em><br>
<p>My parents did the same thing.  As a result I learned to put myself to
<br>
sleep pretty much whenever I wish because it was boring to lay there
<br>
awake since I was not allowed to get back up or do something else.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;I think rather than more discipline, what's needed is for people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;understand the learning and thinking process and to acknowledge that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;learning and thinking cannot be forced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you partially concerning learning and think per se iff the
<br>
necessary discipline to allow learning in the educational environment is
<br>
present. Did you ever try learning when the kids in back are throwing
<br>
anything they can get their hands on at everyone else whenever the
<br>
teacher turns her back?
