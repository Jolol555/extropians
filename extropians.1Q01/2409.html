&nbsp;
<br>
Yes, I agree with that notion. I'd also go further and say that if you
<br>
want to defend yourself under such circumstances, you ought to do so.
<br>
<p>Clue: being a cultural relativist does not mean being a doormat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You appear hostile to cultural relativism -- which, as far as I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concerned, is a vitally important viewpoint that needs to be nurtured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and cherished. (It's the best way of distinguishing fanatics from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people who you can negotiate with: the presence of relativism is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indicator of flexibility.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  So you believe the opinions of primitive witch doctors on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes and cures of diseases say are every bit as good as the latest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from scientific medicine?  So it doesn't matter to you at all in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice which is used to treat you if you fall ill?  
</em><br>
<p>This is a common straw man argument, deployed against cultural relativism
<br>
by people who don't understand it.
<br>
<p>To take your witch doctor example seriously, we can agree that our
<br>
hypothetical primitive witch doctor thinks his nostrums are valid. We also
<br>
(I think) agree that he's wrong. But we're actually cheating, because this
<br>
isn't a social comparison at all: in reality, we have access to a corpus
<br>
of medical and biological knowledge that our witch doctor doesn't even
<br>
know exists, and -- more importantly -- we can verify that our system
<br>
is internally consistent and appears to produce results.
<br>
<p>Which is why I call this a straw man argument. We can verify, against
<br>
an agreed standard (&quot;I use modern medical techniques, I carry on existing&quot;)
<br>
that our own medical practices give better results.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do you mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by &quot;nourished and cherished&quot;?  If it means that you can't judge one as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more valid than the other in any aspects at all without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; un-nourishing then I have a problem.  Flexibility in matters of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does and doesn't work or is and isn't true is not always desirable. 
</em><br>
<p>The whole *point* of the scientific method is that it uses flexibility --
<br>
the willingness to revise beliefs in light of new evidence -- to achieve
<br>
superior results to dogma. This is an instance of the sort of flexibility
<br>
I'm talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Such flexibility would lead to teaching creation science as being just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as valid as evolution in our schools.  Would you consider that a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing?  If not, why not and and on what basis?
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary: &quot;creation science&quot; is promoted by people who aren't
<br>
willing or able to contemplate the possibility that their world view
<br>
is open to criticism. They demand a privileged position, based on their
<br>
belief in a received (biblical, literal) truth.  Their demands for equal
<br>
time are actually the camel's nose under the tent: what they _really_
<br>
want is to ban that Godless Darwin Nonsense(TM).
<br>
<p>They are, in fact, my pet poster-children for the evils of cultural
<br>
absolutism, and the need for a _genuine_ relativist stance. (They want
<br>
&quot;creation science&quot; teaching in schools? They want us to teach that
<br>
evolution is &quot;just a theory&quot;? Fine. We'll teach kids that _both_ ideas --
<br>
Biblical creationism and Darwinian evolution -- are just theories. But
<br>
first we'll give them a grounding in elementary logical fallacies,
<br>
and we'll also show them how to accept/reject a theory on the basis of
<br>
experimentation. Then we'll give them some petri dishes, a culture of
<br>
E. Coli, and some penicillin, and let them experiment with the evolution
<br>
of antibiotic resistance. If they want, they can run a control experiment
<br>
in which they get their local Baptist minister to pray over a culture
<br>
dish in the hope that God will grant its' occupants the mystical power
<br>
to survive antibiotic exposure.
<br>
<p>So yes, on the basis above I'd be happy to see creation science taught
<br>
in schools. I don't think the creationists would, though ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My opposition to relativism (or not) depends hugely on what is and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not meant by that term in real situations.
</em><br>
<p>It occurs to me that you may be used to hearing the term &quot;cultural
<br>
relativism&quot; used by the sorts of people who believe that our whole
<br>
existence is nothing but a text, and that if they appoint themselves
<br>
editor-in-chief they can award themselves a passing grade. Such people
<br>
also frequently assert that the whole edifice of scientific enterprise
<br>
is nothing but an exercise in literary tail-chasing, or a tribal
<br>
ritual. Sorry, but I'm not one of those folks, and I don't have much
<br>
respect for them either. I think they've unconsciously swallowed the
<br>
solipsistic bait that I rejected in my original posting on this matter.
