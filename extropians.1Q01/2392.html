</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a budget.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been following the discussion since end-December 2000, and it is indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not breakable, since built-in at the hardware level. You can't read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (large, many) CPRM keys of a hard drive (stored in a dedicated surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area) by means other than opening it in a clean room, and bypassing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controller.
</em><br>
<p>...or coming up with something to provide a known (maybe blank) key,
<br>
either to run in front of or behind the controller.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is this film called The Matrix, I'm sure some of you might have heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of it [grin]. There's this Keanu Reeves that plays some bloke named Neo in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this film, and Keanu gets USD 30 million to do it. But that might still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; OK; I don't mind that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The man wants to make copying hard. Losses are negligable if 99.9% of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; users can't bypass the copyright protection.
</em><br>
<p>And we're the remaining .1%, or at least belong to them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What I *don't* particularly like is that these people don't realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are already in an outrageously advantegous position, and now they even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to *increase* their advantage. If this succeeds, I think it may lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a totalitarian regime (diguised as a democracy) with content-generators as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the new powers that be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dunno, I can rip off DVDs and CDs just fine. I just don't bother.
</em><br>
<p>One wonders why the large commercial organizations trying to push this
<br>
can't manage to implement hard-to-break security despite the
<br>
availability of peer-reviewed, off-the-shelf methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If they're going to up the ante, we're going to get a rather large alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-commercial culture.  If I make a movie or a music piece, I own the rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to it, and can publish it on the Net as it will darn please me, do PR by word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mouth or hire a PR agency, and take whatever revenue might be coming in.
</em><br>
<p>Possibly conspiracy-theory level, but...what if they push for a law
<br>
saying that only licensed organizations are authorized to give away
<br>
copyright rights (possibly as a step down from these organizations being
<br>
the only ones allowed to have copyright, and that all content authors
<br>
must assign copyright to one of these organizations, with the
<br>
organizations able to declare themselves owner if the author does not
<br>
assign within some finite amount of time)?  The licensing agency might
<br>
be controlled by cartel, or they might just sue any licensor they do not
<br>
approve of out of existence.  Upshot: illegal to be an indie
<br>
distributor.
