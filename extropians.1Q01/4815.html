<DIV></DIV>&gt;Subject: Giving cryo talk to Jewish high school 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Date: Wed, 28 Feb 2001 11:57:29 -0800 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The recent discussions about Islam and Extropianism prompt me to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;mention 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that I'm about to head over to the Milken Community High School to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;give a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;talk about cryonics and life extension to the special honors class 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;there. I 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;resisted agreeing to this, despite having done it several times 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;before, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;because of my tight schedule, but finally caved in. The students at 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;private Jewish high school are the brightest and most engaged young 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;people 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I have had the pleasure of conversing with in years. They actually 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;*listen*, and ask intelligent questions. The Rabbi who invited me 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;also 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;likes to get involved in a friendly but probing way. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Since a lot has happened in biotech recently, I'll try to gauge 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;their 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;responses to see how sympathetic or worried they are. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>
<P>It seems to me that people of the Jewish culture are less antagonistic to cryo-Extro-life-extension ideas. Arlene Sheskin's book _Cryonics_ included a survey of cryonicists from about 25 years ago. Some very large percentage of cryos in her survey were Jewish. Admittedly, many of them apparently came from the New York area, but it was a very large percentage--perhaps 25-50%.</P>
