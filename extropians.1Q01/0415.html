<p>I think that it is very important to note that there are two very different
<br>
sides to Canada, with varying views on governments and science.  The East
<br>
(particularly Ontario and Quebec) is predominantly left-liberal, and due to
<br>
the Canadian electoral system, those two provinces alone can win an
<br>
election.  The West, however (with the semi-exception of British Columbia),
<br>
is generally more business oriented and progressive.  Canada's last
<br>
election at the end of November painted the difference quite starkly, with
<br>
the Liberal party winning Ontario, Quebec and other Eastern provinces, and
<br>
the more progressive right- wing Alliance party cleanly winning in the four
<br>
Western provinces.  Incidentally, the province with the best economy
<br>
(Alberta) is in the West.
<br>
<p>In any event, I am suspicious of articles such as the one shown above due
<br>
to the apparent myopia of the East.  Given that the article is from the
<br>
Ottawa Citizen, I would be willing to bet that all the &quot;Canadians&quot; polled
<br>
are from the East, as my experience with living in the West has shown more
<br>
toleration for GM foods and less toleration for Big Government than the
<br>
article suggests.
