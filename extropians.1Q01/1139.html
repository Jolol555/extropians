<p>There are some Americans who are obsessed with collecting Barbie dolls.
<br>
I've never understood that.
<br>
<p>I don't consider all interests obsessions. Since there are strong
<br>
feelings among some regarding  what they see as an attempt to violate a
<br>
fundamental right, strong words result. After enough strong words from
<br>
all concerned, some sort of spiral can indeed be seen.
<br>
<p>Dirigiste Europeans are free to think Americans are paranoid, childish,
<br>
etc., and so some do. The Code Napoleon strikes me as rather &quot;paranoid&quot;,
<br>
as do many European successful governments of the last two centuries.
<br>
<p>But there you have it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I suspect that statistically *non-gun owning* Americans are wounded or

</em><br>
<p>Good question. Who might collect such figures? How accurate would they
<br>
be? What would they prove? Whose figures, if anyone's, would you
<br>
believe?
<br>
<p>Anyone? Bueller?
