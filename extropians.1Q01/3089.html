<p><p>This can be a dangerous tactic.  I have seen experts come into a 
<br>
classroom with no idea how to teach.  They don't know how to organize 
<br>
their thoughts.  They don't know how to talk down to the level of 
<br>
novices who don't know the subject yet.  They declare things are 
<br>
&quot;apparent&quot; when they aren't to newcomers.
<br>
<p>Being good at a particular topic and being a good teach are two 
<br>
separate skills.  Some people are good teachers but bad at the 
<br>
subject they are trying to teach.  Other people are experts in their 
<br>
subject, but don't know how to convey the knowledge effectively. 
<br>
Some people are good at both.  Some people are lousy at both.
