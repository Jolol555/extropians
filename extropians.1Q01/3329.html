The story I heard about how man invented the keeping of time, it was a
<br>
woman who invented the keeping of time.  The story had the concept that
<br>
some regular repetition, throwing stones, was counted, and that this was
<br>
determined to be repeatable to record the same interval of time.  Later,
<br>
man used the shadow of sticks in the Sun to track time.  Besides that
<br>
micro- time, women probably had a better concept of macro- time as well.
<br>
<p>It doesn't matter if we know that we are all human, unless Yudkowsky has
<br>
gone syntropic, the problem is that there are some people in power that
<br>
are callous and self-serving, where the other ones are busy.

<em>&gt; &gt;Most all of my black friends (or African Americans if you prefer)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;live with being pulled over quite often.  I think it even gets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the point where they feel that it's just something you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deal with and they expect it.  One such friend was astonished when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I told him I'd only ever been pulled over once.  He get's pulled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;over quite a lot, as does his parents, friends, etc. And these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all middle to upper class people.  They just happen to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wrong skin color.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sad phenomenon is do to the tremendous lag time between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovery of a scientific fact and it's eventual incorporation into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact is that every piece of scientific evidence has proven that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are all one species, and that we originated in the Rift valley
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area of what is now modern day Kenya.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every Homo-sapien's on the planet is of African origin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are all literally Africans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I prefer the term American-African myself, where you are is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important than where you came from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't let my pale skin fool you, and don't let your's fool you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are all originally from Africa.
</em><br>
