Subject: Re: Heston Speech
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Since a) there are no posthumans,
</em><br>
S&gt; Nonsense, I have been post-human since the early 1980's, and Blavatsky,
<br>
S&gt; Mather's and other were 'more-than-human' back in the C19th.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And many socialists have been calling themselves 'anarchists' since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kruschev's speech, or since the fall of the USSR. Saying something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't make it so, nor does inventing our own definitions for words.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me, Blavatsky was writing about &quot;post-humans&quot; since 1888,
<br>
and I have been explaining posthuman philosophy and publishing since
<br>
the early 1980's ... it is your (more recent) definition which is wrong!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and b) the singularity has not &gt;occurred,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; Hopefully, and probably, never will. Wot a bunch of speculation and
<br>
dogma.
<br>
S&gt; Singularity is either the centre of a black hole, or a Leibnitzean monad
<br>
as
<br>
S&gt; far as I am concerned ... or has anyone demonstrated another kind?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By definition, posthumans will not exist until the singularity occurs,
</em><br>
<p>Your &quot;singularity&quot; is a fiction that won't happen ... rather like the
<br>
&quot;rapture.&quot;
<br>
What single shred of evidence do you have for it? Who wants to become
<br>
the Borg anyway .... I prefer Dr. Who who fights against would-be daleks!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;so either you should be for the singularity occurring so that you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one day call yourself posthuman, or else stop claiming to be post human.
</em><br>
<p>After (or post-) human simply indicates whatever identity comes
<br>
after the &quot;human being&quot; stage of history .... &quot;trans-&quot; human is subset
<br>
of the after/post-human identity ... for if we are &quot;transitional&quot; then we
<br>
are already different from &quot;non-transitional&quot; humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  c) nobody can make any rational claim as to what 'posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;aesthetic' is, nor is situationalism in any way extropic.
</em><br>
<p>S&gt; Sure, claims are meaningless. It is down to us to forge the new
<br>
aesthetics,
<br>
S&gt; and who says it should be a single standard? Situationalism/ survivalism/
<br>
S&gt; and pragmatism are an alternative to theory-laden, dogmatic approaches.
<br>
S&gt; It is best to stay flexible, react to the presenting realities without
<br>
<em>&gt; filtering
</em><br>
S&gt; out any of the big picture because of ideological blinkers  (extropic
<br>
S&gt; or otherwise). Why restrict yourself and lock-in to some dogma, even if
<br>
S&gt; a futurist/ progressive one? Evolution is about SURVIVAL mainly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Rejecting situationalism does not require dogman. It only requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle. In our case, the Extropian principles are quite fine, and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not dogmatic, nor are they situationalist.
</em><br>
<p>You might think you can reject (the theory of) situationism ... but
<br>
no principles can withstand every real and potential situation!
