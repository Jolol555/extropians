<em>&gt; I don't think that people are quite understanding what you mean by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; QOS - because it's a huge problem that needs to be solved on data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks before they could be used to carry voice traffic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the data networks, IP is the protocol that's used for data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmission.  IP is a great protocol in many ways, but it simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't designed to provide highly reliable dedicated connections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's one thing for your connection to flake out while you're browsing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your friend's home pages.  You just wait for the retries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually get past the problem, you hit reload, or you just try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again later.  Due to the dogged nature of retries going on in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; background, you often don't even notice the discontinuities in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet connections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, if you're talking to your friend and the signal keeps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cutting out and you keep having to call him up, you'd become quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unhappy.  If you're trying to call 911 but you can't get through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because everyone is using all of the available bandwidth in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhood to get to CNN's Elian Gonzales web page, you're in big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although consumers have become used to intermittent service
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulties on cell phone networks and on the Internet, they just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't tolerate the same kinds of problems on dedicated land lines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Riiight, so that's why anyone who can afford it seems to be replacing
<br>
their landlines with cell phones? The only two things I generally use my
<br>
landlines for nowadays are receiving faxes and calling internationally (I
<br>
get a slightly better rate). There are companies out there like LEAP
<br>
Wireless that are selling cell service as landline replacement. I think
<br>
it is a MYTH that consumers actually care that phone service is &quot;5 nines&quot;.
<br>
The reason it is held to that standard is not because of market demand, but
<br>
rather because of government regulations.
