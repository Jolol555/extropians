<p><p><em>&gt; Okay, here's a more precise version.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Take the key from A.  Do this at 5:44PM.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Unlock B.  Do this at 5:45PM.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Take the key from B.  Do this at 5:46PM.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Unlock A.  Do this at 5:43PM.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I want to say for the record that I actually *tried* this with two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locked boxes each containing the other's key, and it *worked*.  I didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually time it to the exact minute, and I had to reorder the steps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly since I didn't have a time machine, but I *did* it and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *worked*, so I don't want to hear any further complaints.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I did not put one of the boxes inside the other one.  No, I was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing inside either of the boxes.  No, one of the boxes was not shaped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a key to the other.  And no, the boxes were not made of wood.  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did check them, they were securely locked, and there was no way to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; key out of either one without unlocking it.  And this was in *real life*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plain ol' physical reality, so you can be sure there were no meta-tricks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.
</em><br>
<p>Possible solutions:
<br>
<p>1) You have a third key.
<br>
<p>2) You can unlock a box without the key.
<br>
<p>3) Both boxes begin locked. Key A is inside the lock of Box B. Key B is in
<br>
inside Box A.
<br>
You unlock Box A (Step 4).
<br>
You put Key B inside Box A.
<br>
You take Key B from Box A (Step 1).
<br>
You unlock Box B (Step 2).
<br>
You put Key A inside Box B.
<br>
You take Key A from Box B (Step 3).
<br>
<p>Hmm, no. I'm afraid this wouldn't satisfy me as a valid answer. Key A
<br>
starting inside the lock of B doesn't really count as being inside Box B.
<br>
Neither does placing each key inside the other boxes at different times.
<br>
<p>4) The locks were combination locks &amp; the keys were their numbers written on
<br>
pieces of paper.
<br>
<p>5) The boxes were identical and so were the keys. You managed to unlock each
<br>
box with the key of the other by getting it to fall into the lock. Then
<br>
using something to turn the key from the other side (the outside) of the
<br>
lock. Tricky but possible.
<br>
<p>Hmm, so what are these boxes made of anyway?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Dale Johnstone.
