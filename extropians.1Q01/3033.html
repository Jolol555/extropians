</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The difference is that in a small town people KNOW each other. They pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;each other on the street and say hi several times a week. They risk their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;lives together when there's an emergency such as a flood or major fire. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;so forth. There's a HUGE difference between being arrested by someone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whom you're just a generic criminal and being arrested by someone whose kid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you took to the hospital the time he fell from a tree and broke his arm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does knowing someone have to do with prosecuting them as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawbreaker?  Are you implying that someone should get special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leniency or treatment because he knows the police who caught him?
</em><br>
<p>No, small towns are just different. My family moved to NH when I was 9
<br>
from Lowell, Mass. In Lowell, the kids ten blocks over were the enemy,
<br>
cops were scary people who treated everyone equally, just like crap, and
<br>
scary stories kids told each other camping in tree houses didn't need to
<br>
be fabricated, they came right off the front page of the Lowell Sun.
<br>
<p>In Lebanon, NH, (pop 12,000), kids from all over town would hang out
<br>
together, most kids knew at least one or two cops personally (and they
<br>
knew those cops knew their parents as well), and old biddies all over
<br>
town would sometimes call my parents (or the parents of other kids I
<br>
hung out with) letting them know where we were, especially if we looked
<br>
like we were up to no good (which was frequently). Getting pulled over
<br>
by a cop as a teenager was not bad, since when they called your name
<br>
over the radio to check on your ID, usually another cop would get on the
<br>
horn and say,&quot;that's such and so's kid&quot;. Cops are part of the community
<br>
in a small town, and treat people they come in contact with as
<br>
neighbors, not as enemy soldiers. In such a community, police are 'our
<br>
cops', not 'those cops'.
<br>
<p>Our neighboring town, Hanover, just had its first murders in ten years
<br>
(the last one before that was in 1939), a husband/wife couple of
<br>
Dartmouth professors were stabbed to death in their homes, apparently by
<br>
a Dartmouth student (i.e. not native to the area) they had mentored and
<br>
who has dissapeared. I was actually surprised that national media has
<br>
flocked into town to cover the story (likely they want their bosses to
<br>
pay for skiing trips), and the police and state AG's office is being so
<br>
mum about the case that the national and out of state media is getting
<br>
really pissed off. I think they were more ticked off that no guns were
<br>
used.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; What's the difference between this system and having a large team of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  police officers, who have thoroughly studied hundreds of photos of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  felons and wanted criminals, watching near the gate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Not much difference here. And not much difference from situations where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people are encouraged (or frightened) into spying on their neighbors and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reporting them to the cops.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yikes, what a non-sequitur.  &quot;Frightened&quot;?  You're implying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having some intelligent surveillance cameras or plenty of ready
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officers on hand is like cops bullying people into ratting on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbors?  Doesn't that ignore the poor ethics of the cops in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullying someone to the point of fear?
</em><br>
<p>No, its like having a high cop to citizen ratio, however small
<br>
communities are the way they are because citizens watch out for their
<br>
community too, so the 'cop' population is even higher. Having
<br>
surveillance cameras in the big city is like having hundreds and
<br>
thousands of little old ladies with a permanent line to 911.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But there's something wrong with all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pictures. A society that needs that sort of observation of its members in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;order to enforce its rules must have some structural flaws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh... Yes?  Are you saying that our society lacks structural flaws?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A society that needs *any* observation of its members in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce its rules must have some structural flaws - it's just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter of minimizing the impact of those flaws upon the law-abiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of our society.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it structural, its more a systemic failing, partly induced
<br>
by insufficient acclimatization of immigrants, partly induced by
<br>
communalist tendencies and ideologies denigrating the individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I'm not satisfied with the safety level in our society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the last ten years or so, I've had my car stolen, my car broken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into and valuable items stolen, a friend who was mugged and slashed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in broad daylight downtown, etc.  Those issues are fresh in my mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and impact my life quite often - affecting where I go and what I do.
</em><br>
<p>Last time I was victimized by crime was when I was assaulted in
<br>
Burlington Vermont by some acid-head picking a fight. The time before
<br>
that was when my truck was broken into in San Francisco. City events.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To contrast that, I've never had law enforcement agents take my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property or make me feel like I might lose my life.  I can't think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any friends or friends of friends who've had serious encounters with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law enforcement that they didn't bring upon themselves.  I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always enamored with policemen.  Sometimes they can be a bit haughty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but give me an asshole cop writing me a ticket versus someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stealing my car from IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE any day.
</em><br>
<p>Tell me: how many of the crimes you cite have actually been investigated
<br>
and/or solved? I'll bet none of them. The break-in in SF that happened
<br>
to me was never solved, not that they actually put much effort into it,
<br>
(the guy who assaulted me got busted because he was so high that he
<br>
flagged down the cop for me ;-)). I'll bet if you had used a gun to
<br>
restrain the guy who stole your car, you'd have been arrested for
<br>
brandishing and assault with a deadly weapon.
<br>
<p>In Lebanon, I've been a witness to an assault, a DWI, and an instance of
<br>
destruction of town property and submitted statements which nabbed the
<br>
bad guy in every instance. Unlike city dwellers, I didn't say &quot;I'm not
<br>
involved, so I didn't see anything.&quot; I knew the guy who committed the
<br>
assault that I witnessed and fled the scene, so I and other witnesses
<br>
could not only describe the guy, but give his name and parent's address.
<br>
That doesn't happen in the city. People know me in this community. Bad
<br>
guys know who I am, that I am as likely as not armed, so consequently
<br>
not much bad stuff happens around me. The more private citizens that are
<br>
likely to be armed creates a blanket of security over a small town that
<br>
a big city can't match. Most all crime that occurs up here is committed
<br>
by people that are either drunk or high or both, such that they forget
<br>
about that blanket of security and the eyes of their neighbors.
