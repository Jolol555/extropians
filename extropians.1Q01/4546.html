<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;GE

<em>&gt; &gt; The object of a mutual fund is making money, not the unqualified investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in companies that make things you like.  Buying publicly traded stock on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the market doesn't benefit the company (ignoring minor secondary effects),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so you aren't doing them any favors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, but if one has to invest, you can't beat the advice of Warren
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buffet, who does say to invest in companies that make things you use,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and he sure hasn't done too badly on that strategy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A better strategy is to invest in good companies that don't do anything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't like (say, donating money to HCI, for example).  About half the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; companies on your list are marginal or speculative investments that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably do relatively poorly as a group.  For example, gun companies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generally a poor investment -- I wouldn't qualify their outlook as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particularly high growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gun companies are *currently* a poor investment, but are actually a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good value due to current public hysteria and anti-gun propagandizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (though there is the effect of sales going up every time some nut wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pass another ban...). At one point in the 80's, Texaco was a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor investment due to a $12 billion judgement against them to be paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Pennzoil. A year later the judgement was settled for $2 billion and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tripled my money.  Based on this, if you think that tort reform of one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind or another is likely in the next few years, invest in gun, tobacco,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil aircraft, chemical, and step-ladder companies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the point of this exercise is to use our collective foresight to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; predict what companies are likely to be the leaders in technology fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that will become huge (and profitable) in the future, gaining growth via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our presumed ability to accurately identify important ground floor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology ventures so that we can profit from explosive growth.  Balance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that with a few smart blue chips like IBM and Merck, and you have a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; basis for a mutual fund.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought I was. Given increasing energy demand due to the internet (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 13% increase in power demand in California is any indication), stocks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like GE and Westinghouse should be nice secure growing stocks. Given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased defense spending under Bush, Boeing and Lockheed stand to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most. All four are rather secure stocks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SeaLaunch cuts launch costs so should pick up market share as it gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the ground. Whether the consortium puts its stock on the market is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another question. Orbital and Kistler stand to do well as space is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privatized more and launchers come on line.
</em><br>
<p>You should have gotten Ralston Purina, Gatorade, and transportation stocks.
