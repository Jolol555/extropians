<p>You're no worse than say, Gore, when it comes to flip-flopping... ;-)
<br>
<p>To be consistent, though, you'd have to agree that private property
<br>
rights should restrict any recordings from public property onto private
<br>
property.
<br>
<p>The problem I find with this public transparency for everyone is that it
<br>
will lead to a more puritanical society, or at least if it leads to a
<br>
more tolerant society, it will be over the bodies and reputations of
<br>
thousands, if not millions of people before standards change.
