<em>&gt;I'm still not getting it, Robin.  My supposition was that some do-gooders
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;buy enough bonds to repay the effort.  This doesn't sound like your &quot;unless

<em>&gt;they also have private info about whether they will help&quot;, which seems much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more passive.  You seem to be drawing causality the other direction: if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they know they will help address the policy issue, then they buy more bonds.
</em><br>
<p>They need to have private info about whether they will buy enough bonds.
<br>
<p>Now this private info can come naturally in the process of trying to
<br>
privately buy bonds.  If the people on the other side of each trade do not
<br>
know whether this buyer is the do-gooder or a mere speculator, if the buyer
<br>
is a do-gooder, she can gain a little on the trade.  This gain to the
<br>
do-gooder is a loss to the seller.
<br>
<p>Let's consider an example.  You want to reduce the crime rate in some region
<br>
and sell a billion dollars in bonds at an auction.  Each bond pays $1 if
<br>
the crime rate falls below some threshold, and nothing otherwise.  If the
<br>
crime boss does nothing, there is a 20% chance of crime falling enough.
<br>
If he foregoes $100M in profits he can increase this to a 40% chance.
<br>
Now if the crime boss held all billion bonds in his hands, he would max
<br>
his profits by reducing crime.  This would cost him $100M but gain him
<br>
(.4-.2)*$1B = $200M in expected bond value.  If he held half of the bonds
<br>
he would be just indifferent between reducing crime or not doing so.
<br>
<p>Now imagine that the bonds go up for sale in a (non-package) one-time
<br>
auction.  If speculators thought there was a probability P that the crime
<br>
boss would gain 75% of the bonds, and thus want to reduce crime, they would
<br>
bid $P for each bond, and so the crime boss would profit by the amount
<br>
(.4 - (.4*P + .2*(1-P)))*75%*$1B - $.1B.  This is negative if P &gt; 1/3.
<br>
Thus to profit from this approach the crime boss needs to create the
<br>
impression that there is less than a 1/3 chance of reducing crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is also supposed to be one of the strong points of Idea Futures.  IF
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provides incentive for effort to be placed in areas where someone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invested.  Some polymaths can decide where to spend their investigation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time based on which market they have collected sufficient coupons to make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient return on.
</em><br>
<p>The concept of idea futures is to create incentives to produce information,
<br>
not to create incentives to make good policy happen.  (That's the concept
<br>
of futarchy :-).
