Without reposting anything Barbara Lamar wrote - because I agreed with all
<br>
of it -- I want to add my own 2 cents to this thread.
<br>
<p>I approach the matter of raising my children like the proverbial sculptor
<br>
approaches an uncarved block of stone: I look for (try to perceive
<br>
imaginatively) the form hidden within, and then I chip away the obtruding
<br>
stone until that form is revealed.
<br>
<p>In other words, I try to understand what my children need and want, and then
<br>
I work with them to fulfill their needs and to enable them to exercise their
<br>
talents.
<br>
<p>This does not mean that they are undisciplined, however. They know that when
<br>
I tell them to do something, I expect them to do it. &quot;I should only have to
<br>
tell you once&quot; is my motto.
<br>
<p>I spend a lot of time with my kids. We play together, do fun things
<br>
together, and also spend a lot of boring time doing chores together. I
<br>
believe that the quantity of time one spends with one's children is just as
<br>
important as the so-called &quot;quality time&quot; which may not be long enough or
<br>
often enough to meet a child's needs for time-with-a-parent.
<br>
<p>Because I am so close to my kids, the only form of punishment I have ever
<br>
had to use with them is to deny them time with me. If they seriously
<br>
misbehave, I tell them that we cannot do something that they had wanted to
<br>
do. That's it; no swatting, hitting, or other forms of corporal punishment
<br>
are needed. At the worst, the youngest one might have to sit in a corner in
<br>
&quot;time out&quot; until she agrees not to hit her old brother (who never hits her
<br>
back, by the way).
<br>
<p>My kids (ages 15, 8 and 2) were weaned gradually (the youngest is still
<br>
nursing). My wife lets them nurse until around age 3, but we don't have a
<br>
hard and fast rule about that.
<br>
<p>As for sleeping arrangements, the baby of the litter always sleeps in our
<br>
room, either on the futon we keep on the floor next to our bed, or in bed
<br>
with us. Is this inconvenient for us? Yes, but not terribly so. We can move
<br>
her for an hour or so, and we get time alone when we need it. More
<br>
importantly, our children are happily well-adjusted intelligent individuals
<br>
who have not the slightest doubt that they are loved and supported.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael LaTorra
