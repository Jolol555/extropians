<em>&gt; Olestra is a non-digestible oil.  Like Castor Oil, it goes all the

</em><br>
<p>Castor oil doesn't cause diarrhea because it's undigestible. It causes
<br>
diarrhea because it contains a trace amount of ricin, a substance which in
<br>
larger--but still quite small--amounts causes death by dehydration due to
<br>
uncontrollable diarrhea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is true that scientific studies show that the incidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this to no higher with Olestra than with regular chips.  But for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some reason, consumers of regular chips don't seem to report this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon while consumers of Olestra do.  The scientific studies do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not seem to match the experience of actual consumers.
</em><br>
<p>So what? There is a small percentage of the population with severe peanut
<br>
allergies. One peanut can be fatal to them. Death is arguably more serious
<br>
than severe gas and diarrhea, yet the FDA hasn't banned peanuts. Why not?
<br>
Well, because lots of people like them and aren't allergic to them. Those
<br>
who shouldn't eat peanuts can simply not eat them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is normal for the FDA to review consumer complaints for a new food 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or drug product.  If there is a high number of complaints, they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require these to be studied before use of the new product can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanded into higher-use applications.
</em><br>
<p>On the one hand we have reports of severe diarrhea in some small percentage
<br>
of the population. On the other hand, we have millions of obese people who
<br>
could benefit dramatically from wider use of Olestra. Once reasonable
<br>
precautions have been taken, further delays to ensure absolute compatibility
<br>
with the entire population of the world are foolish and borderline immoral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...  All recalled products, such as Thalidomide, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were first proven safe in the laboratory.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense. Nothing can be proven safe. And obviously if it was, it couldn't
<br>
cause harm, could it, unless the definitions of &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;prove&quot; have been
<br>
changed recently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Why would federal health regulators unnecessarily restrict such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;desirable and popular product?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because many people report severe, painful and embarrassing symptoms 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within an hour of eating this substance.
</em><br>
<p>Well, gee, we wouldn't to *embarrass* anyone, would we? Sheesh. Meanwhile,
<br>
we refuse to allow Olestra to be used to improve the actual, physical health
<br>
of millions of Americans.
<br>
<p>I've eaten Olestra, and I never had a negative reaction to it. But you know
<br>
what I'd do if I did? I'd stop eating it. Duh.
