<p>True and false in the same sentence.
<br>
<p>On the one hand, yes: lots of people who think the singularity is imminent
<br>
fall into the same pitfall as the fundies with their rapture. And yes, the
<br>
development of new technologies tends to follow a sigmoid curve that caps
<br>
off after a while. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, what we're seeing is *more and more* new technology
<br>
curves starting up, based on existing ones. For example, in the nineteenth
<br>
century the only really obvious ones in action were steam power,
<br>
telegraphy, and ironworks. These days, we probably see that many new,
<br>
fundamentally important technologies, starting up every week. As David
<br>
Brin commented a couple of years ago, there are now more scientists alive
<br>
and working full- time than in the whole of human history up to about
<br>
ten or twenty years ago.  We've got an order of magnitude more people
<br>
than they had in 1900 -- and they're overall better educated. This means
<br>
*more* than an order of magnitude more scientists and engineers working,
<br>
so it would be astonishing if they weren't coming up with new discoveries
<br>
and technologies.
<br>
<p>The real point of the singularity argument, though, is this: posit a 
<br>
single assumption -- that intelligence is a computational process (or can
<br>
be emulated by computational processes). This assumption falls out of an
<br>
explicit rejection of cartesian dualism (for which neuroscience has found
<br>
no supporting evidence). It's not a cut-and-dried issue yet, but opponents
<br>
of computational intelligence have to jump through quite a few hoops if
<br>
they want to prove that it is impossible (cf. Roger Penrose, Ronald Searle).
<br>
<p>*IF* we posit the possibility of a computational intelligence that is human-
<br>
equivalent in its ability to cogitate, and *IF* we develop such a tool, 
<br>
*THEN* we can be certain that said tool can also invent a CI. We can also
<br>
be certain that by throwing more (or vastly more) processing resources at
<br>
it, we can enhance its speed. Thus, we get what Vinge describes in his paper
<br>
(see <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0092.html">http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0092.html</a>) as &quot;weak superhumanity&quot;
<br>
(or &quot;fast thinking&quot;). At this point, the rate of change goes through the
<br>
roof -- human thought processes are slow in comparison.
<br>
<p>This still doesn't give us the singularity (a la Rapture) that many
<br>
people believe in; it just gives us very rapid incremental improvements
<br>
to everything we can see around us, such that a lot of hard problems get 
<br>
solved. (For example, if there's a non-obvious shortcut to building an 
<br>
economically useful cheap fusion reactor, expect it to be invented at 
<br>
this point.)
<br>
<p>The big leap of faith comes if we posit the possibility of higher-order
<br>
types of intelligence existing. Just what these are, or would act like,
<br>
isn't really clear. (However, Hans Moravec takes a stab at them (see:
<br>
<a href="http://www.ix.de/tp/english/special/vag/6037/1.html">http://www.ix.de/tp/english/special/vag/6037/1.html</a>). If it's possible
<br>
for a human-type intelligence to build a computational higher-order
<br>
intelligence, then this is more likely to be carried out by a weakly
<br>
superhuman AI trying to augment itself than by human scientists. And this
<br>
really does represent a singularity, because beyond this point we can no
<br>
more understand the intelligences modifying the universe we live in than
<br>
the cat sitting on my mouse-mat and purring right now can understand this 
<br>
posting.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this gives us a chain of possibilities, linked by assumptions
<br>
about the world that are testable:
<br>
<p>* Do combinations of technologies facilitate the serendipitous discovery
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of yet more new technologies? (If so, each technology might follow a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sigmoidal curve of development, but the overall curve you get when you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;superimpose them all will be exponential)
<br>
<p>* Is consciousness computationally tractable? (If you believe in immaterial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;spirits and ghosts, the answer is clearly &quot;no&quot;; if, on the other hand,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you believe that our consciousness is an emergent property of brains,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which are just big wet endocrine glands with horribly complicated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;internal connections, the answer is clearly &quot;yes&quot; -- although the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*degree* of tractability can vary; estimates of the computational
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bandwidth of a brain run in the range 10^16 to 10^24 MIPS, but could go
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drastically higher if quantum processes are involved, as Penrose asserts).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Moravec's paper at <a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm">http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm</a>;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;personally I think he's over-optimistic.)
<br>
<p>* This begs the question of mind uploading (is human consciousness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;something that can be transferred to a computing device -- see
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/jstrout/uploading/MUHomePage.html">http://www.ibiblio.org/jstrout/uploading/MUHomePage.html</a>). However,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;simulated neurons in a well-known biological system
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have been successfully coupled to a real system; see
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://inls.ucsd.edu/~hdia/home.html">http://inls.ucsd.edu/~hdia/home.html</a> for a description of the research.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(The paper is <a href="http://inls.ucsd.edu/~hdia/neurorpt.pdf">http://inls.ucsd.edu/~hdia/neurorpt.pdf</a> -- &quot;Interacting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;biological and electronic neurons generate realistic oscillatory
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rhythms&quot;, pub.  Neuroreport on February 28, 2000).  This appears to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be the first actual case of uploading in practice -- admittedly, of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a couple of neurons in the stomatogastric ganglion of a spiny lobster.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="http://cart.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1999/NASA.report.99/">http://cart.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1999/NASA.report.99/</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for a tool which, in fifty years' time, might be able to do it in real
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;time to a human brain.
<br>
<p>* If consciousness is computational, can it be optimized for higher
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;performance? (Almost certainly &quot;yes&quot; for linear speed improvements -- 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;very probably &quot;yes&quot; for algorithmic improvements *if* mimicking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;human consciousness is less of a priority than getting thinking done
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fast).
<br>
<p>* Are higher orders of intelligence possible? (Don't know -- we have no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence. However, see 
<br>
<a href="http://cart.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html">http://cart.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for some interesting speculations on the implications of causality 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;violation for computation.)
<br>
<p>If you stack enough &quot;S&quot; curves on top of each other, you get something 
<br>
that looks awfully like an exponential ...
