Hmm, the rhetoric isn't new, but we better get better at countering
<br>
these memes at the source.
<br>
<p>Note the assumption that genetic engineering will make us beastly -
<br>
there is room for an entire postmodern essay about the assumptions
<br>
hidden in that reasoning. It is intriguingly modernistic/conservative
<br>
in its bias against the beastly and implications that good old family
<br>
values must be retained despite claiming to be against the modern
<br>
project.
<br>
<p>I think the core of Kass' argument is that by designing children we
<br>
remove the respect for the unique. But he makes a fundamental error
<br>
here by assuming genetic determinism. Our unique personal identity
<br>
does not stem from our genes - they are a necessary but not sufficient
<br>
basis - but from how we develop as a dialectic between the genes,
<br>
environment and our own actions/thoughts. New life emerges in its
<br>
novelty even among a bunch of clones.
<br>
<p>I think the big problem postmodernists (Damien, as the resident expert
<br>
here might disagree) see with transhumanist technologies for
<br>
self-modification is that they make someone (me or my child) an object
<br>
of transformation, hence reducing the person. Making humans objects =
<br>
bad. But if I change myself, then I am both subject and object in a
<br>
strange loop, and I would say the criticism against transformation
<br>
making us into objects become invalid. In the case of a child there is
<br>
no object in the first place, but only later does something appear -
<br>
something that becomes a subject.  The issue is how to get around
<br>
simplistic genetic determinism poisoning the upbringing of children,
<br>
but that is not different from how to deal with other neurotic
<br>
mistakes in upbringing. It is a cultural problem, not a problem
<br>
inherent in genetic engineering.
<br>
<p>I found it humorous that Kass blames utilitarianism and libertarianism
<br>
for the technological imperative in this context, since I attended a
<br>
lecture with Torbjorn Tannsjo, a leading Swedish utilitarian (well
<br>
known here for his controversial editorials where he applies
<br>
utilitarianism ad absurdum to medical ethics) about genetic
<br>
engineering of humans. He surprised me by becoming libertarian on this
<br>
issue (otherwise he is a firm socialist), saying that the best
<br>
solution would be no government control over what bodies are ideal and
<br>
that it would entirely be up to the parents to decide on what genes to
<br>
insert. He then defended it well against the assembled social
<br>
democrats who were itching for government controls. How this squares
<br>
with his socialism and utilitarism is left as a puzzle. But I guess
<br>
Kass wouldn't be happy about this kind of unholy agreement.
