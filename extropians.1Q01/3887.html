If the Singularity pops up in the standard, Singularity (tm) form, the
<br>
business world might have a lot of other things to think about at the
<br>
time...
<br>
<p>Programming is unlikely to dissapear; I think it'll probably increase.
<br>
Programmers do the meta level of automation - creating automated systems -
<br>
where that creation is not, in itself, automatable. As time progresses, more
<br>
of the meta level becomes automatable... which also always seems to mean we
<br>
can automate a bunch new things which before we could not. However, these
<br>
new capabilities of software, previously unachievable, but now achievable
<br>
due to increased automation of things we used to do by hand, tend to,
<br>
themselves, require hand coding. And so, the programmer goes on.
<br>
<p>Think of it this way... at any time, we can do a bunch of things
<br>
automatically, and there are a bunch of things which we cannot do at all.
<br>
Between these two bunches (lets call them, um, sets), exists a bunch of
<br>
things which we can do only by hand (relying also on many layers and many
<br>
generations of prewritten software). Or to put it another way, we can always
<br>
do more with automated systems + coders, than we can do with automated
<br>
systems alone.
<br>
<p>We are a necessary evil... we wont go back in the box!

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From an encyclopedia article I am editing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;   The 1954 Preliminary Report on Fortran stated that &quot;...Fortran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;   should virtually eliminate coding and debugging...&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this quotation well known?  No reference was given.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've never seen a reference to this specific quotation, but I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen many references to the indestructible hope held over the years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by the managers who hate having to pay for programmers that some magic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; software tool will eliminate them once and for all.  In the 50's, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; magic software bullet was newly-invented high-level languages like
</em><br>
Fortran
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and COBOL.  In more recent years, it's been other tools, like
</em><br>
report-generation
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; languages, relational databases, object-oriented languages, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so-called 4GLs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have a book called _The Programmer's Survival Guide_ by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Janet Ruhl (Prentice Hall, 1989) that's unusually frank about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the attitude corporate management has toward data processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; staff:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -----------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; p. 41 &quot;Why Management Doesn't Like Programmers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In every business I have ever worked in, no matter how much lip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; service was paid to the importance of technical people, the simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact remains that... the skills that management rewards most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; highly are precisely those that management itself has -- and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are definitely not technical skills...  The fundamental truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that anyone who ventures into a corporate environment needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand is that all rewards in the corporate world stem from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the degree to which you are helping the company make a quick buck...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Computers are Overhead&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This fact should be engraved over the doorways of all data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processing offices in large gold letters.  Except for a small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number of companies that make their profits selling computer programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and programming services, the programming of computers is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; directly contributing to the profitability of the corporation...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because computer programming is overhead, all good managers want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to keep it as controlled as possible.  The problem, unfortunately,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that computer systems are almost uncontrollable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most of the major decisions that lead to the development of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer systems in large companies are made by extremely nontechnical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; upper management types who don't want to go overboard on costly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer systems but are swayed by the press releases and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blandishments of very effective vendor salesmen...  Often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; salesmen will go out of their way to assure the hesitant executive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that he will not be dependent on programmers.  Murmuring buzzwords
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like &quot;fourth-generation language&quot; and &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the salesman bears tales of a wonderful future in which computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will program themselves, conversing with the (executive) user
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like well-trained children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -----------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course, if those vendors ever get to the point of really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; delivering on those implied promises, we'll be in the midst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the Singularity.
