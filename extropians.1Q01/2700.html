<p>Man, you are OUT of your mind. The women would be sex slaves, 
<br>
bartered and sold or rented out--or stolen. You're talking the worst 
<br>
convicts around. Get real.

&gt; &gt; &gt; some have speculated, &quot;free basics&quot; might come with some strings attached...
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly.  Free basics in exchange for non-reproduction.  The
&gt; free food would contain birth control medications.  Everyone
&gt; wins: society could offer educational benefits, shelter, food, you
&gt; name it, and even the conservative element would gain some
&gt; enthusiasm.  The medications would be non-permanent, so that
&gt; if the recipients get with it and row their own boat, then they
&gt; can after a few months bear litters of pups.  What we still need
&gt; is a medication that makes the men temporarily sterile.  Ive heard
&gt; such a thing exists, dont know the details.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, when you think it over, we could remake prison colonies
&gt; this way, for those who are serving life terms.  Delete the death
&gt; penalty, create a prison colony where men and women can live
&gt; together in a roach-motel kinda city, difference being everyone
&gt; there is sterile.  Im sure the prisoners would opt for it in a second.
&gt; The main hitch is that there are probably at least 20 to 1 men to women
&gt; doing life.  That colony would be worse than the Silicon Valley.

&gt; The ladies need not fear mistreatment in such an arrangement:
&gt; as in the old west, even the most inferior examples of womanhood
&gt; would be well protected from those who would do them harm.
