<p><em>&gt; An orthogonal view of architecture to that of Soleri is provided by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christopher Alexander.  Alexander believes that the strongest constructions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the best places to live or work) are those that have developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organically.  In his work, he has attempted to codify all the forces that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come into play at varying levels of abstraction (from design of a doorway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to regional planning of highways).  He then does design, taking into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account all the patterns he has captured, leaving room in the process for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the various parts of the developing entity to inform each other so that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result can be much more than the result of one person's ability to foresee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the affects ahead of time.
</em><br>
<p>I was first introduced to Alexander's work many years ago when I saw a 
<br>
copy of &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; on the desk of a co-worker. Since we are both 
<br>
computer programmers, I assumed it was about programming. He leant me the 
<br>
book, and I became fascinated by it. Ever since, it has strongly 
<br>
influenced my views on architecture. All that having been said, I'm afraid 
<br>
that in many ways Alexander seems to be a bit of a luddite, in that the 
<br>
book is almost totally devoid of technological solutions to architectural 
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>For example, he notes a number of studies (another nice thing about the 
<br>
man, he provides references) that show that people living in apartments 
<br>
that are over 4 floors removed from the street almost never participate in 
<br>
the activities that go on at street level, while those who live four 
<br>
floors or less removed often do. His conclusion is that no habitat should 
<br>
be over four floors tall. *My* conclusion was that a communal living area 
<br>
must be within four floors (and within view) of any living quarters.  His 
<br>
conclusion rules out arcologies (for instance), where my conclusion merely 
<br>
imposes some reasonable constraints.
<br>
<p>This is just one example. Throughout the entire book I kept wanting to 
<br>
shake the man and say &quot;Look, technology *exists*. Use it already!&quot;. The 
<br>
final third of the book, concerning details of house construction was the 
<br>
most bothersome. He seems to feel that houses need to be customizable 
<br>
(fine by me) but that that implies that the house must be modifiable by 
<br>
hand, *without* the benefit of power tools.  Now, I've yet to live in a 
<br>
house that didn't undergo modifications to suit  me or my parents, and not 
<br>
once did we find the requirement of power tools either offensive or 
<br>
difficult. In fact, we would have scoffed at the idea of walls that were 
<br>
soft enough that you could carve out bookshelves with a spoon. The results 
<br>
would have been walls that were always scratched and missing bits.  Just 
<br>
think what kids would do to such a structure!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's at least a start at a theory of how to design in a way that allows the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inhabitants and users of a space to adapt the built environment to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own needs and tastes.
</em><br>
<p>It is that, and I do heartily recommend the book to those interested in 
<br>
architecture, or design issues in general. I'm just saying it has its 
<br>
flaws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's a sub-culture in software development (within Object-Oriented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Programming) that has stolen the theme from Alexander and started
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing similar catalogs of patterns of forces at varying levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstraction.  Alexander gave a talk at Stanford in November on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications for software of his ideas.  (He apologised for not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding software better.)  He apparently has more readers these days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the software community than in architecture.  Like Soleri, he's never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten much respect or attention from his peers.
</em><br>
<p>True. Many of the problems of designing large complex systems are shared 
<br>
by architecture and computer science and Alexander provided a wonderful 
<br>
insight into a way or organising interlocking solutions to these problems 
<br>
as they are developed. That said, most books that I've yet seen on 
<br>
software patterns are either too simple, or seriously flawed. Then again, 
<br>
the field is in its infancy. Give it another 10-20 years and we may start 
<br>
having a field of computer engineering which is worthy of the 
<br>
'engineering' part.
