<p>I hope you're right.  One of the best programmers we did have in our 
<br>
office there was a woman.  Our Indian office manager was a little 
<br>
scandalized when we made her a project leader, and the other men had 
<br>
to report to her.  Not only did the fact that she was female 
<br>
intimidate them, but she was Muslim to boot. :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;I could spend days detailing my experiences there and those of my 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;big magical mystery.  They're not just the fault of their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;government or their large population or the evil Western World. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It's a failure of the individuals of their society who embrace a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;culture of ignorance, corruption, and getting the &quot;other guy&quot; to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;their work for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Based on what you saw of life in India, Chris, what effect do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think a guraranteed income would have on individuals (assuming that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such a thing were possible at no cost to anyone else, such as with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nanotechnology)?
</em><br>
<p>Would they stand on that bedrock to try to do more with their lives 
<br>
in terms of achieving educational and career goals?  Or would 
<br>
standing around talking to their friends be what they'd do every day 
<br>
of their lives - because they could.
<br>
<p>If the very act of getting food for themselves and their families 
<br>
isn't motivation enough for some people, how much motivation will 
<br>
those same people have in life when even food isn't a concern?
<br>
<p>I think that if you gave everyone in India who is starving a 
<br>
&quot;limitless&quot; supply of food, you'd see a population explosion there of 
<br>
unimaginable proportions.  How far will even miraculous 
<br>
nanotechnology be able to be stretched before we once again have 
<br>
people starving?
<br>
<p>I believe that most of mankind's societal problems are self 
<br>
inflicted, and that no matter how miraculous the technology that we 
<br>
discover, we won't achieve the kind of &quot;world problem solving&quot; 
<br>
progress that has been discussed in this thread until we change 
<br>
ourselves.
