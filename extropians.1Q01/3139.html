<em>&gt; Marlow quoting Hogan:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hmm.  Difficult to know which to pick.  Maybe the question of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; origin of the stupendous amount of information in a genome -- genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; program coding not only structural organization &amp; growth, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instincts, behavior, responses to injury, stress, etc. etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is this being measured?  I've cited the work of Brooks and Wiley in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous posts.  They use a formalism to evaluate the information in living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, the surprising thing should not be the amount of information, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the amount of noise in living systems.  I'm sure we are all aware of DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes -- to stick with DNA; the focus should not be on DNA alone -- many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random changes in DNA have no or little impact on anything else.  Part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is because DNA and proteins made from it -- indirectly, of course --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have active sites and passive sites.  Most of DNA and most of protein is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passive -- just there for the ride and as long as it doesn't affect anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else, it doesn't make a difference.  An analogy might prove helpful here.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein's active site might be compared to the tires on a car or any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vital component.  The license plate cover on a car, however, is more like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passive site.  It has no or little effect on performance.  It might on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; margin, but, for the most part, it does not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Now, imagine if lots of random change accumulates in passive areas, then an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; active area changes or an area changes that makes formerly passive areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; active.  You might wind up with a huge shift in DNA or protein behavior.)
</em><br>
<p>**I believe what he's saying is that all, or at least many, eventualities were coded
<br>
&nbsp;for at or near inception. That &quot;useless excess&quot; DNA is not in fact useless--but 
<br>
waiting to be triggered into usefulness by changing conditions.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Darwinism were correct, such programs accumulated from nothing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tiny increments.  Hence every evolutionary step along the way, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; average, should add information to the growing genome.  But _not one_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the examples usually cited in textbooks etc. as &quot;evolution in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action&quot; has ever been found to add information, and so cannot count
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as a meaningful evolutionary step.  Bacterial resistance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; antibiotics, for example, (e.g. streptomycin) results from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deterioration that loses the molecular specificity necessary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accept the antibiotic's deactivating &quot;key&quot; -- i.e. a loss of genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information, not a gain.  The much-touted pepper moth in England is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simple instance of population dynamics, the dominant color changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as the environment changes.  But light and dark varieties were both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; present to begin with.  Nothing genetically new came into existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with the peppermoth example.  In fact, Brooks and Wiley use it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their _Evolution as Entropy_ to highlight the difference between reversible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and irreversible change.  They believe the latter is more important to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution.  However, you seem to be overlooking the fact that variations can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arise.  We'd have to do further, deeper analysis to see why both varieties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist -- under the assumption that such variation is not primary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet these are offered as among the best examples. Programs of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complexity don't write themselves from random changes.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact, the reverse -- the more complex and precise a program becomes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the more random changes are likely to disrupt it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Genomes, in general, are very resilient to some disruptions.  Even though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g., humans get cancer, even most cancer victims live long enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce, raise their children, and so on.  I would look at the problem the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way.  Why is there so little information in any genome of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevance to the organism?
</em><br>
<p>**See above point. Little of relevance to the organism _in the 
<br>
present environment._
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's important to distinguish between information and the medium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; holding it. &quot;Macbeth&quot; remains the same play whether represented as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ink on paper, dots on a diskette, sound waves, laser pulses, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Similarly with genetic information.  I'd contend that saying genomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are just an emergent property of DNA is like saying Macbeth is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emergent property of ink and paper, missing the whole point that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; medium isn't the origin of the message.  It just carries it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such a distinction makes sense in an abstract symbol system like writing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The alphabet we use has no necessary relation to information coded in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Macbeth&quot; would still be &quot;Macbeth&quot; even if it were coded in, say, Unifon --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we knew how to read Unifon.  However, the relation between DNA and an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism is a lot different.  The genome of any living thing is not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract symbol system.  In fact, it's an active information system and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes proteins and regulates itself.  There are triggers of when to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain things and what to do in it.  It requires no outside interpreter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it does have emergent properties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the analogy between &quot;Macbeth&quot; and biological information breaks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down on these points.  (But getting back to random mutations, imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changing a period to a comma in &quot;Macbeth.&quot;  How much meaning would be lost?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for not wanting to debate the issues, well, whatever.:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers!
