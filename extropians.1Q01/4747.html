<p>The Hidden Cost Of P2P

<br>
<p>If peer-to-peer applications become ubiquitous, they could break the
<br>
existing business models of many Internet service providers and force
<br>
them
<br>
to raise their prices, experts said.
<br>
<p>Peer-to-peer computing, which lets networked computers act as both
<br>
clients
<br>
and servers, is the next great innovation on the Internet, according to
<br>
some marketers. Napster is the best-known P2P application, but dozens of
<br>
new companies are developing all kinds of P2P applications for consumers
<br>
as
<br>
well as business customers.
<br>
<p>&quot;The hype around P2P is valid,&quot; said Larry Cheng, an associate at
<br>
venture
<br>
capital firm Battery Ventures. &quot;It's changing the nature of Internet
<br>
computing.&quot;
<br>
<p>But observers predicted the rise of P2P could also mean the rise of
<br>
Internet service provider (ISP) access fees. Why? Because P2P programs
<br>
have
<br>
the potential to radically change the amount of bandwidth the average
<br>
Internet user consumes.
<br>
<p>The flat-rate pricing of most ISPs is based on the assumption that
<br>
subscribers will only intermittently access the Web or e-mail. ISPs
<br>
often
<br>
&quot;oversubscribe&quot; their networks by a certain ratio - 40-to-1 is typical -
<br>
which means they don't actually have the capacity to handle all of their
<br>
users simultaneously.
<br>
<p>So, if most computers on an ISP's network stay constantly connected
<br>
running
<br>
a P2P application like Napster - chewing up bandwidth by serving up
<br>
files
<br>
or otherwise communicating with other peers in the network -- the
<br>
original
<br>
ISP usage model will be shattered. And in that case, ISPs may have no
<br>
recourse except to raise their access fees, experts said.
<br>
<p>&quot;The ISPs are in a tough situation,&quot; said Clay Shirky, a partner at The
<br>
Acceleratorgroup, an investment firm. &quot;All of their pricing models were
<br>
based on everyone at the edge of the network tolerating second-class
<br>
citizenship. They're totally unprepared for the idea that end users will
<br>
distribute content to each other.&quot; Shirky's firm has invested in two P2P
<br>
start-ups, Aimster and Uprizer.
<br>
<p>ISPs have long had to deal with &quot;bandwidth hogs.&quot; From a service
<br>
provider's
<br>
perspective, these are customers who cost money by using an unusually
<br>
large
<br>
amount of bandwidth to download large files from Web sites or
<br>
newsgroups,
<br>
or to view streaming media clips.
<br>
<p>But P2P applications are different, experts said. They can turn any
<br>
computer into an always-on bandwidth glutton because they run
<br>
unattended,
<br>
without any user intervention.
<br>
<p>There's no shortage of P2P programs available that could potentially bog
<br>
down ISP networks. In addition to Napster, start-ups such as Flycode and
<br>
OpenCola are developing new P2P file sharing programs. Other file
<br>
swapping
<br>
programs, such as BearShare and LimeWire, are built around the open
<br>
source
<br>
Gnutella P2P protocol. Meanwhile, P2P companies such as Entropia,
<br>
Popular
<br>
Power and United Devices are building distributed computing services,
<br>
which
<br>
propose to use thousands of Internet-connected computers to process
<br>
large
<br>
computational problems.
<br>
<p>None of these programs has become as popular as Napster - which claims
<br>
to
<br>
have 62 million registered users - but Napster has provided a stark
<br>
glimpse
<br>
into the ability of P2P apps to overwhelm networks. Universities were
<br>
the
<br>
first to feel severe pain from Napster, which was actively adopted by
<br>
college students when it was released in 1999. Many institutions - and
<br>
some
<br>
private corporations - have banned the application from their networks,
<br>
and
<br>
others are taking steps to limit the amount of bandwidth Napster users
<br>
consume.
<br>
<p>For now, most service providers are monitoring the growth of P2P
<br>
application usage on their networks. But ISP executives admitted that if
<br>
their customers' bandwidth usage shifts substantially, they may have to
<br>
increase their access fees.
<br>
<p>&quot;If there's a quantum leap in demand, then we'd have to modify and
<br>
change
<br>
our cost model a little bit,&quot; said Steve Dougherty, EarthLink's director
<br>
of
<br>
systems vendor management. He added, though, that EarthLink's aggregate
<br>
bandwidth consumption historically has increased gradually from month to
<br>
month. &quot;The growth isn't going to suddenly double one morning,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>What's more, ISPs said, their bandwidth costs drop regularly. &quot;We're
<br>
seeing
<br>
greater decreases in the cost of the bandwidth than we are seeing
<br>
increases
<br>
in individual bandwidth usage,&quot; said David Allred, vice president of
<br>
broadband services at Telocity, a provider of residential Digital
<br>
Subscriber Line (DSL) services.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, some ISPs have adopted restrictive policies regarding the
<br>
use
<br>
of P2P applications in order to cut down on bandwidth use. Cox
<br>
Communications last year notified Cox@Home cable modem service
<br>
subscribers
<br>
that using Napster or other file sharing programs violated their terms
<br>
of
<br>
service agreements.
<br>
<p>Analysts predicted that if bandwidth-intensive P2P applications become
<br>
more
<br>
popular, more ISPs will offer tiered pricing plans. Instead of raising
<br>
rates across the board, ISPs &quot;may add an additional tier of [service
<br>
for]
<br>
high-bandwidth users,&quot; said Rob Lancaster, an analyst at The Yankee
<br>
Group.
<br>
<p>Qwest Communications International already offers a $19.95-per-month
<br>
plan
<br>
for DSL service that requires a customer to log off every two hours for
<br>
10
<br>
minutes. The always-on version of the service is $29.95.
<br>
<p>While P2P computing evangelists are fond of saying P2P takes advantage
<br>
of
<br>
otherwise &quot;wasted&quot; resources, such as bandwidth, the truth of the matter
<br>
is
<br>
that bandwidth isn't free.
<br>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that somebody has to pay for it,&quot; said Preston
<br>
Austin,
<br>
president of Clotho Advanced Media, a small Web consulting firm.
