<em>&gt; A &quot;felon&quot; is simply and only a person convicted of breaking certain

</em><br>
<em>&gt; felonies, irrational or not.  The *felon* is first and foremost a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That is why I said 'non-citizen' versus 'non-person'. Non-citizens here
<br>
in the US are restricted in many areas: they cannot carry concealed
<br>
weapons or own guns (because as non-citizens, they are not part of or
<br>
eligible to belong to the 'militia', organized or unorganized, which is
<br>
made up of all voter-eligible citizens).
<br>
<p>A felon is in a state of what is called 'civil disability', meaning that
<br>
due to their criminal convictions, they are disabled from belonging to
<br>
the militia, and from engaging in many other activities which are the
<br>
natural right of people, especially those who are citizens. A felon can
<br>
regain the right to vote and keep and bear arms by petitioning the court
<br>
for 'relief from civil disability' after three years of good behavior
<br>
following the conclusion of their sentence (which includes probation
<br>
time).
<br>
<p>You are right to be concerned about 'slippery slopes' if government
<br>
decides to make a large percent of the population into felons, however,
<br>
as I've said before, people tend to get the government they deserve. If
<br>
enough people wanted that sort of government, they are going to get it
<br>
whether they like the results or not. This occured in both Germany and
<br>
Italy, where the concept of natural rights was non-existent. Here, at
<br>
least, the logic is that government can only suspend one's rights for
<br>
demonstrating an inability to use them responsibly, it cannot
<br>
permanently confiscate them because they don't belong to or originate
<br>
from the government. This doesn't mean that such abuses are impossible,
<br>
they just take longer and require a slower rate of erosion.
<br>
<p>I hope this explains my position better.
