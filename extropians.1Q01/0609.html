<em>&gt; Additional problems include: High Pressure Nervous Syndrome (HPNS), which

</em><br>
<p>Nah, even at 70 g, the max hydrostatic pressure is only about 3 bars-
<br>
the total N2 saturation would be modest, and limited by the lower
<br>
pressure in the upper portions of the body.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For a diver, HPNS is bad news because he has to function as a worker, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mention survive in a hazardous environment, but for an astronaut just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laying back for the trip, it's not so critical.  I'm not a hundred percent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain, but as I recall the theory of HPNS attributes it to mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distortion--due to compression--of neural cell membranes, and that it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be prevented or reversed by administration of anesthesia, which, absorbed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the membranes, causes them to swell.  First it restores normal nerve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function, then, with additional absorbtion and swelling, it puts you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sleep.  So to prevent our astronaut from becoming wired to the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seizures--that's what HPNS does to you--we have to medicate him.
</em><br>
<p>No, HPNS is adequately countered by adding a small amount of N2 to the
<br>
breathing mix.  That's how the 2000+ fsw dives were done, and is used in
<br>
routine saturation diving at lesser depths.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What with the escalting complexity of life-support with increasing G
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces, I conclude that one G, a good book, some videos, and a bucket of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; McNuggets will do just fine.  Two days one hour and fifty minutes (at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mars-to-earth closest approach) is less time than it takes to cross the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atlantic by boat, even today.
</em><br>
<p>Perzackly- and engine mass is typically proportional to thrust, so it
<br>
would probably be the best trade of speed vs performance to drop the
<br>
acceleration to 1 m/s and take 3x as long to get there- using 1/3 the
<br>
propellant.  A few weeks is still far better than nine months.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And one last comment.  The rotary rocket engine, the spinning wheel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhaust nozzles at the periphery, dynamic geometric simplicity replacing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex and expensive turbopumps, remains for me a concept of breathtaking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dazzling elegance.  I am bereft and inconsolable at the thought that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to be.  Rather, I choose to believe that persons of venality and small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision, the spawn which curseth humanity by their abundance, have simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postponed the day when that beauty of engineering shall grace the skies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tell me Doug--lie if you have to--that there is still hope.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, there *is* hope but the rotary engine is not the be-all and end-all
<br>
of efficient and simple propulsion.  It has a certain elegance, true,
<br>
but it has its own can of worms also.  I can't talk about our activities
<br>
at XCOR, but we *are* making progress.
