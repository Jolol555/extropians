True true--though I must confess I give more credit based on what I 
<br>
know him to Anders' dismissal of V than to Clark's--and more still to 
<br>
Einstein's--who wrote (Yes, I'm citing authority!):
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;I have read the whole book about the planet Venus. There is much of 
<br>
interest in the book which proves that in fact catastrophes have 
<br>
taken place which must be attributed to extraterrestrial causes. 
<br>
However it is evident to every sensible physicist that these 
<br>
catastrophes can have nothing to do with the planet Venus and that 
<br>
also the direction of the inclination of the terrestrial axis towards 
<br>
the ecliptic could not have undergone a considerable change without 
<br>
the total destruction of the entire earth’s crust. Your arguments in 
<br>
this regard are so weak as opposed to the mechanical-astronomical 
<br>
ones, that no expert will be able to take them seriously. It were 
<br>
best in my opinion if you would in this way revise your books, which 
<br>
contain truly valuable material. If you cannot decide on this, then 
<br>
what is valuable in your deliberations will become ineffective, and 
<br>
it may be difficult finding a sensible publisher who would take the 
<br>
risk of such a heavy fiasco upon himself.&quot;
<br>
AE, July 8, 1946, letter to IV
<br>
I suggest E was right (isn't he always?) in that some here give no 
<br>
credence to what may be of value because of the Venus assertions--
<br>
which are the only ones I've seen attacked.
