</em><br>
<p>Aristotle spoke about: the material cause,
<br>
the efficient cause, the formal cause,
<br>
the spontaneity &lt;automaton&gt;, the chance &lt;tyche&gt;,
<br>
the inner final cause &lt;telos&gt;, the hylomorphic way
<br>
(matter becomes form or, shall we say?, information).
<br>
<p>We all know, at least after John Bell, that chance
<br>
is not 'incidental' (as Aristotle said), and that
<br>
physical sequences are intentionless, and that Lamark
<br>
was wrong. 
<br>
<p>But his idea that a cosmic 'evolution' (self-referential,
<br>
Aristotle said: ³doctor doctoring himself²) is going on
<br>
is still alive (Wheeler¹s ŒU¹, etc.). And this is the
<br>
Œvery interesting¹ point, imo.
<br>
- scerir  
<br>
<p>Aristotle in nuce. 
<br>
<p>Spontaneity and chance differ in that spontaneity
<br>
is the wider term. Every result of chance is from
<br>
what is spontaneous, but not everything that is from
<br>
what is spontaneous is from chance. Chance is in
<br>
the sphere of moral actions. Hence what is not capable
<br>
of moral action cannot do anything by chance.
<br>
The spontaneous on the other hand is found both
<br>
in the lower animals and in inanimate objects.
<br>
Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects
<br>
which though they might result from intelligence
<br>
or nature, have in fact been caused by something
<br>
incidentally. Both (spontaneity and chance) belong
<br>
to the mode of causation source of changes,
<br>
for either some natural or some intelligent agent
<br>
is always the cause. But in this sort of causation
<br>
the number of possible causes is indefinite.
<br>
Now since nothing which is incidental is prior to what
<br>
is per se, it is clear that no incidental cause can be
<br>
prior to a cause per se. Spontaneity and chance, therefore,
<br>
are posterior to intelligence and nature. Hence, however
<br>
true it may be that the heavens are due to spontaneity,
<br>
it will still be true that intelligence and nature
<br>
will be prior causes of this ³all² and of many things
<br>
in it besides.
<br>
<p>For those things are natural which, by a continuous
<br>
movement originated from an internal principle,
<br>
arrive at some completion: the same completion
<br>
is not reached from every principle; nor any chance
<br>
completion, but always the tendency in each is towards
<br>
the same end, if there is no impediment. The end and
<br>
the means towards it may come about by chance.
<br>
But it is absurd to suppose that purpose is not
<br>
present because we do not observe the agent deliberating.
<br>
The best illustration is a doctor doctoring himself:
<br>
nature is like that. It is plain then that nature
<br>
is a cause, a cause that operates for a purpose.
