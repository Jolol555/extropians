<p>Weary? Bored? Suicidal?  I can't see any basis for concluding that such 
<br>
feelings would be the norm for 1000-year-old people. How do you figure 
<br>
this? I haven't found that life becomes any less exciting as I age. In 
<br>
fact, since I've gained some skills and knowledge along the way, I'm 
<br>
finding life even more interesting now than it was when I was younger.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It's not even interesting being pretty and strong if everybody is pretty 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What a strange idea! I've found my strength to be of greater use to me when 
<br>
I'm alone in the woods than when I'm in the company of other people. And 
<br>
the pleasure of doing things with a well-functioning body, even simple 
<br>
things like harvesting lettuce from the garden, is quite as wonderful when 
<br>
there's no one around to notice or be compared to. Being pretty?  Well, one 
<br>
doesn't often look at one's own face, but I confess I've admired the sight 
<br>
of my sturdy, sandal-clad feet, and I doubt my admiration would be any less 
<br>
if everyone in the world had feet as lovely.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;A thousand years wise might mean something.
</em><br>
<p>In the past there have been so few really intelligent people alive at any 
<br>
one time. Many of the geniuses of the past speak to us now through their 
<br>
writings. I wonder what the world would be like if they weren't dead now, 
<br>
if we could chat with them on the Internet or sit by the river and talk to 
<br>
them.
