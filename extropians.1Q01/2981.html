Makes you afraid to show your face in public--criminal or no.
<br>
Next the thing will trap suspected criminals as they pass through a 
<br>
gateway.
<br>
<p>Welcome to the future.

<em>&gt; GRAPHCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. Provides Surveillance for Raymond James 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stadium to Identify Known Suspects, Deter Crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On January 28th, Criminals No Longer Another Face in the Tampa Stadium Crowd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tampa, Florida, January 29, 2001 -Graphco Technologies, Inc. (G-TEC), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a leading developer of technology and solutions for biometric 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authentication, secure access, and expert information-sharing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems, announced today that they provided a surveillance and facial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognition system at both the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa and at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ybor City, Florida. The system was in place from January 21 - January 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 28, 2001 to monitor potential criminal activities during the sporting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events and related activities at the two locations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In cooperation with the Tampa Sports Authority, Graphco Technologies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partnered with Raytheon Company's (NYSE: RTNA, RTNB) Linthicum, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maryland office, Viisage Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: VISG), and VelTek 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; International, Inc., to provide its FaceTrac facial recognition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system to the Tampa Police Department and other federal, state and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local law enforcement agencies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Not everyone comes to sporting events with good intentions,&quot; says 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Watkins, G-TEC's Managing Director, &quot;The multiple distractions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the nation's premier athletic events provide criminals with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities to engage in a variety of illegal activities. G-TEC's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facial recognition system provided the Raymond James Stadium with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superior surveillance system that not only captures images of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals but also compares their facial features against a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; database of known felons.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The FaceTrac core facial recognition technology provides the ability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to locate faces, to build 'face print' templates and to recognize 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matches to images stored in a database. When integrated with G-TEC's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law enforcement database, FaceTrac allows rapid search, comparison 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and identification of suspect facial photos within the database. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FaceTrac may be used for surveillance with multiple locations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networked to a high capacity site, for analysis and system-search 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results. G-TEC installed FaceTrac at the Raymond James Stadium as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single site system, integrated with a custom designed database and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search result notifications for tracking faces in a crowd and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monitoring access to secure areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tom Colatosti, Viisage President and CEO said, &quot;Places where large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crowds are present, such as sporting events, are tempting targets for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all types mischief, criminal behavior and larger threats. Using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patented Viisage technology, G-TEC has introduced a new generation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools for law enforcement officials to more effectively and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-intrusively provide for public safety. As an integral partner in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the project, Viisage Technology provided G-TEC with the industry's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leading and most robust face-recognition technology.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Viisage Technology's FaceFINDER software drives the FaceTrac 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surveillance and identification process. Viisage's industry-leading 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face-recognition technology has the world's largest image database 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deployment in surveillance and investigative applications. Viisage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also provided the project with image acquisition and integration 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology and services.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During the week of January 21st, G-TEC deployed the FaceTrac system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the Raymond James Stadium to detect and identify 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals who are wanted or suspect, and may present a danger to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public. Using standard cameras to recognize human faces during 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entry to the sporting event, FaceTrac continuously compared faces in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the incoming crowd to an extensive, customized database of known 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felons, terrorists, and con artists provided by multiple local, state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and federal agencies. A law enforcement task force of local, state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and federal agency personnel monitored the system. Once individuals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were matched with photo files in the database, officers of the joint 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; task force, circulating throughout the complex, could be dispatched 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately to make possible arrests, quickly and discreetly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In addition to installing cameras supplied by VelTek International at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Raymond James Stadium, G-TEC adapted its FaceTrac capability to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cameras in Ybor City, Florida to oversee the celebrations before and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the athletic events. Raytheon Company, a global developer and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplier of high-tech products and services, and a G-TEC partner, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided sophisticated cameras and expertise to provide police with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceptional night vision capabilities for poorly lit or darkened 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas in Ybor City.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure and applications in support of public and private law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforcement, corporate security, manufacturing, and secure
