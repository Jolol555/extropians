<em>&gt; Claims by some scientists that humans in this century will have a life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectancy of 100 or even 120 are not realistic and not supported by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trends measuring the rates of death, said S. Jay Olshansky of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; University of Illinois, Chicago. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We anticipate that many people here today will live long enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; witness a life expectancy of 85 years, but everybody alive today will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long dead before a life expectancy of 100 is achieved, if ever,&quot; said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Olshansky. 
</em><br>
<p>Olshansky has an article in the March issue of Scientific American showing
<br>
a number of his (rather questionable) improvements to the human body that
<br>
would make it more suited to long life.  Thicker bones, stronger disks,
<br>
extra muscles seem reasonable enough.  But knees that bend backward
<br>
and don't lock in place would, he admits, make standing difficult.
<br>
Raising the trachea would reduce the risk of choking on food, but would
<br>
have the minor side effect of disrupting breathing and speech.
<br>
<p>It's a valid point that the human body could be improved, but Olshansky
<br>
tries to draw the lesson from this that significant enhancements to
<br>
lifespan are impossible.  The problem is that he is focusing on relatively
<br>
minor symptoms of old age: arthritis, disk problems, incontinence,
<br>
varicose veins, cataracts, etc.  It will undoubtedly be a big job to
<br>
fix all these, but most of them are not life threatening.  Even if we
<br>
couldn't do anything about all this, it wouldn't have implications for
<br>
life extension.
<br>
<p>To make his point he needs to list conditions that actually kill people.
<br>
And there wouldn't be much difficulty in doing so; just look at the list
<br>
of the top 20 or 30 killers.  Then he could argue that to extend lifespan
<br>
we'd have to have interventions that dealt with all of these problems,
<br>
which is going to be extremely difficult (pending a fix-everything pill).
<br>
<p>But he doesn't do this.  Admittedly his fanciful drawings of dwarvish
<br>
humans with backwards knees are more eye-catching than charts showing
<br>
the death rate from kidney failure.  But if he wants to conclude that
<br>
significant life extension is unlikely, he needs to use a different
<br>
argument.
