Briefly; we were both in San Francisco and he had a talk to attend.

Decidedly eccentric mannerisms and speech in person--but it sure

<p>**Well, I &quot;know&quot; him now. As to the insufficient respect; on THIS

list that's hard to take personally...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; Spike: Had an interesting chat with a NASA dude the other night.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Turns out NASA personnel were in fact openly discussing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; feasibility of sending quad amps on extended missions to other worlds-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -Mars in particular.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ja, well I would think they need 2 good arms at least, and these can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried with little penalty, unlike legs...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Nowthen, if our home were to be a 2 meter radius sphere, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person of my height, 185 cm, the quarters would effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have only one floor: a flat surface with another flat surface 187
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cm above that, since there is tremendous psychological advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to being able to stand up straight.  {Trust me on this one, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I lived in Seattle during the summer of 1983 in a &quot;structure&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I could not stand up straight.  Long story.}  A 185
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cm person, who might actually stretch a couple cm in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0.38G, would find it close quarters indeed...
</em><br>
<p>**Heh. The guy I was talking to is 6'7.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice Im not suggesting *amputating*
<br>
<em>&gt; operable legs, but rather choosing a volunteer who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already lacks these lower appendages.
</em><br>
<p>**Yah; they were talking of using people already quads. &quot;They don't 
<br>
need them anyway, why not lop them off?&quot; was his comment. (And he 
<br>
doesn't look like a funny guy, trust me.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I told him someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (you) had suggested bringing new humans in test tubes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or a thermos bottle, yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But of course that's not exactly feasible just now either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly why not?  If we had a female version of Troyer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could she not thaw and implant a frozen embryo, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subsurface farm works out?  Such technology has been with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us for years actually.  What did you see as the show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stopper?  spike
</em><br>
<p>**Oh, saaay--the 18 year mission duration before you have someone 
<br>
halfway competent to do anything useful which requires 
<br>
mobility/dexterity...
<br>
<p>**Quads wouldn't work anyway, in my opinion; the minute something 
<br>
went wrong which required mobility/dexterity--they die and the 
<br>
mission fails.
