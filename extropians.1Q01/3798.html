<p>I don't know; that's what scares me.  &lt;grin&gt;
<br>
<p>Okay, that wasn't the response you were looking for... what got me onto
<br>
that track was thinking about our mental stream-of-consciousness, and
<br>
where the sentences come from in the first place, and what the difference
<br>
is between thinking up the sentence and actually enunciating it
<br>
internally.  Plus at least one person on SL4 saying that they had learned
<br>
to think without enunciating a stream of consciousness, which is something
<br>
that I once tried to do but hadn't even begun to make progress on.  So I
<br>
started to wonder whether the full complexity was really necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also please give your working definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;thought&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>In humans, the running dialogue that forms our stream of consciousness. 
<br>
Formed by taking symbols - nouns, adjectives; content creators and content
<br>
modifiers - mutually targeted in such ways as to form coherent structures
<br>
that load coherent visualizations into working memory.
<br>
<p>In AIs, the highest level of description of cognitive content - the one
<br>
that implements the business of designing and analyzing and planning and
<br>
so on, as seen on CaTAI section 2.4, &quot;Thoughts&quot;.  I initially thought this
<br>
was going to work the same way as in humans; now I'm no longer sure this
<br>
is the simplest possible implementation, but I'm still planning to do it
<br>
the human way unless something concretely simpler comes along.
