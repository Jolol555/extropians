<em>&gt;Riiight, so that's why anyone who can afford it seems to be replacing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their landlines with cell phones?
</em><br>
<p>Bleah, the one guy I know who tried that owns a cell phone business 
<br>
in Silicon Valley (Sunnyvale).  He got all the free minutes and best 
<br>
phones, so it seemed to be a financial no-brainer when he moved into 
<br>
his new house to not purchase any land lines.  He had to give it up 
<br>
after a couple of months because he kept losing important calls.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  The only two things I generally use my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;landlines for nowadays are receiving faxes and calling internationally (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get a slightly better rate). There are companies out there like LEAP
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wireless that are selling cell service as landline replacement. I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is a MYTH that consumers actually care that phone service is &quot;5 nines&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The reason it is held to that standard is not because of market demand, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather because of government regulations.
</em><br>
<p>When I pick up my cell phone to make a call and it doesn't go through 
<br>
or it gets disconnected, I'm irked - but I understand that it's the 
<br>
price I pay for being mobile and a limitation of the technology.
<br>
<p>When I'm at home, I *know* the level of service that land lines are 
<br>
able to provide.  I want crystal clear, reliable connections that are 
<br>
made every single time I dial.  If the phone companies degrade that 
<br>
QOS, my phone service had better start being for free.  If a 
<br>
higher-quality non-free service is available, I imagine I'll be one 
<br>
of the suckers paying for it.
<br>
<p>I guess I'm a part of that MYTH you mentioned.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
