<em>&gt;Presuming that you do remember to take it, does Melatonin work? I seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have buckled the wheel on my sleep cycle; I'm all over the place.

<p><p>Yes, it does work for most people. My mom takes 3mg a night and it works
<br>
pretty well for her. And it's a great, cheap anti-aging supplement.
<br>
<p>LEF has a lot of info on it. There are some articles on it here:

<p>Melatonin replacement therapy of elderly insomniacs
<br>
Sleep (UNITED STATES) Sep 1995, 18 (7) p598-603,
<br>
<p>Changes in sleep-wake patterns are among the hallmarks of biological aging.
<br>
Previously, we reported that impaired melatonin secretion is associated with
<br>
sleep disorders in old age. In this study we investigated the effects of
<br>
melatonin replacement therapy on melatonin-deficient elderly insomniacs. The
<br>
study comprised a running-in, no-treatment period and four experimental
<br>
periods. During the second, third and fourth periods, subjects were
<br>
administered tablets for 7 consecutive days, 2 hours before desired bedtime.
<br>
The tablets were either 2 mg melatonin administered as sustained-release or
<br>
fast-release formulations, or an identical-looking placebo. The fifth
<br>
period, which concluded the study, was a 2-month period of daily
<br>
administration of 1 mg sustained-release melatonin 2 hours before desired
<br>
bedtime. During each of these five experimental periods, sleep-wake patterns
<br>
were monitored by wrist-worn actigraphs. Analysis of the first three 1-week
<br>
periods revealed that a 1-week treatment with 2 mg sustained-release
<br>
melatonin was effective for sleep maintenance (i.e. sleep efficiency and
<br>
activity level) of elderly insomniacs, while sleep initiation was improved
<br>
by the fast-release melatonin treatment. Sleep maintenance and initiation
<br>
were further improved following the 2-month 1-mg sustained-release melatonin
<br>
treatment, indicating that tolerance had not developed. After cessation of
<br>
treatment sleep quality deteriorated. Our findings suggest that for
<br>
melatonin-deficient elderly insomniacs, melatonin replacement therapy may be
<br>
beneficial in the initiation and maintenance of sleep.

<p>Improvement of sleep quality in elderly people by controlled-release
melatonin
Lancet (ENGLAND) Aug 26 1995, 346 (8974) p541-4,
<p>Melatonin, produced by the pineal gland at night, has a role in regulation
of the sleep-wake cycle. Among elderly people, even those who are healthy,
the frequency of sleep disorders is high and there is an association with
impairment of melatonin production. We investigated the effect of a
controlled-release formulation of melatonin on sleep quality in 12 elderly
subjects (aged 76 [SD 8] years) who were receiving various medications for
chronic illnesses and who complained of insomnia. In all 12 subjects the
peak excretion of the main melatonin metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin during
the night was lower than normal and/or delayed in comparison with
non-insomniac elderly people. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study
the subjects were treated for 3 weeks with 2 mg per night of
controlled-release melatonin and for 3 weeks with placebo, with a week's
washout period. Sleep quality was objectively monitored by wrist actigraphy.
Sleep efficiency was significantly greater after melatonin than after
placebo (83[SE 4] vs. 75[3]%,p &lt; 0.001) and wake time after sleep onset was
significantly shorter (49 [14] vs. 73 [13] mm, p &lt; 0.001). Sleep latency
decreased, but not significantly (19 [5] vs. 33 [7] mm, p (0.088). Total
sleep time was not affected. The only adverse effects reported were two
cases of pruritus, one during melatonin and one during placebo treatment:
both resolved spontaneously. Melatonin deficiency may have an important role
in the high frequency of insomnia among elderly people. Controlled-release
melatonin replacement therapy effectively improves sleep quality in this
population.
