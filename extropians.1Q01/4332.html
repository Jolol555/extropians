<p>Language can fuel, or abate, public fears about bioengineered foods
<br>
<p>FOR RELEASE: 18 FEBRUARY 2001 AT 12:00 ET US
<br>
North Carolina State University
<br>
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/">http://www.ncsu.edu/</a>
<br>
<p>Frankenfoods or miracle crops to help feed a hungry world?
<br>
<p>Your feelings about genetically modified foods depend, in good measure, on
<br>
how their benefits and potential risks are explained to you. The words used,
<br>
and
<br>
the way they're used, color your perceptions. That seems obvious enough,
<br>
says Dr. Steven B. Katz, associate professor of English at North Carolina
<br>
State
<br>
University.
<br>
<p>So how come so many scientists and policy-makers don't get it?
<br>
<p>&quot;The important role that language plays in the public's perception and
<br>
reception of scientific data and risk assessment is often neglected by
<br>
scientists and program administrators,&quot; said Katz, who has reviewed many
<br>
case studies, both in the U.S. and abroad, of controversial subjects - like
<br>
biotechnology - that have been slowed or completely halted by public
<br>
opposition.
<br>
<p>&quot;In many of these cases, public resistance, at least in part, has been
<br>
traced to communication problems - flawed rhetorical choices and faulty
<br>
assumptions
<br>
by scientists about the role of language, emotion and values in
<br>
communicating
<br>
with the media and public,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Katz will present &quot;Language and Persuasion: The Communication of
<br>
Biotechnology with the Public,&quot; at 9 a.m. PST (noon EST) Sunday, Feb. 18, at
<br>
the annual
<br>
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in San
<br>
Francisco. He also will offer some positive recommendations for facilitating
<br>
biotechnology communication with the public.
<br>
<p>Katz's examination of the role language plays in the biotechnology debate
<br>
touches on a number of crucial issues: the effect words may have on the
<br>
public; the way experts accommodate information for non-expert audiences;
<br>
communication models for risk-assessment communication; and the importance
<br>
of public
<br>
participation in the process.
<br>
<p>Syntax, diction and the arrangement of ideas in communication all seem to
<br>
play significant roles in determining its effect, Katz has found. &quot;Even when
<br>
a
<br>
paper is 'clearly written,' word choice, style and order of presentation can
<br>
have
<br>
an effect on the public's reception, understanding and acceptance of
<br>
communication concerning biotechnology,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Sacrificing accuracy for general comprehension - though necessary - can also
<br>
complicate matters if the communication about the benefits and risks of
<br>
science, such as biotechnology, is not built on the concerns, knowledge and
<br>
values of the audience, Katz said. If scientists have an understanding of
<br>
their audience, &quot;the information is transformed in that it becomes a
<br>
different
<br>
message, one adapted to the specific needs of the audience,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Certain communication models, such as the practice Katz calls &quot;one-way
<br>
communication&quot; - in which the educator or expert does all the talking and
<br>
the public does all the listening - can be detrimental to the communication
<br>
process. No consensus can be achieved when this occurs, because the public
<br>
is given little or no voice in the discussion. &quot;This form of communication
<br>
will
<br>
often devalue the listener or audience because the listener or audience is
<br>
given no opportunity to provide input, ask questions or make decisions,&quot;
<br>
Katz said.
<br>
<p>&quot;The values and knowledge of the public need to be respected, recognized and
<br>
utilized in communication,&quot; he said. &quot;There are serious implications for
<br>
biotechnology research and industry if they are not.&quot;

<p>&quot;Language and Persuasion: The Communication of Biotechnology with the
<br>
Public&quot; By Steven B. Katz, NC State University Feb. 18, 2001, at the
<br>
American
<br>
Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting
<br>
<p>Abstract: The role that language plays in the communication of science to
<br>
the general public is an important if generally unrecognized one within
<br>
fields
<br>
of science. The important role that language plays in the public's
<br>
perception
<br>
and reception of scientific data and risk assessment is often neglected by
<br>
scientists and program administrators who seek to apply in the public realm
<br>
new discoveries and knowledge to improve existing products or methods,
<br>
and/or
<br>
implement advanced or novel techniques to create new products and
<br>
procedures.
<br>
<p>Cases abound, both in the U.S. and abroad, of technologies that have been
<br>
slowed or completely halted by public opposition. In many of these cases,
<br>
public resistance, at least in part, has been traced to communication
<br>
problems, which in turn are often based not only on flawed rhetorical
<br>
choices of style
<br>
and organization but also on faulty assumptions about the role of language,
<br>
emotion, and values in the communication process even in science, but
<br>
especially in scientific communication with the media and the public. This
<br>
is no less true in biotechnology communication, which still has been largely
<br>
unexplored even by those studying the use of language and persuasion in
<br>
science. This presentation will review relevant literature on the rhetoric
<br>
of audience accommodation, risk communication, and public controversy caused
<br>
by
<br>
problems of communication; present models of communication and discuss the
<br>
various issues and values implicit in each; and then apply rhetorical
<br>
criteria developed in the literature to an examination of examples of
<br>
biotechnology
<br>
communication with the public. Concepts and assumptions embedded in and
<br>
communicated to the public through diction, syntax, and organization will be
<br>
illustrated. Finally, possible suggestions for facilitating biotechnology
<br>
communication with the public will be offered.
