<em>&gt;You'd be surprised at how rationally children behave when they're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give the opportunity. I can't see why a child would NEED to come up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against hard realities. Sometimes the hard realities can't be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avoided, but it seems very strange to wish them upon your child or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone else you love.
</em><br>
<p>Why would you say that I &quot;wish&quot; them upon my child when I never even 
<br>
remotely implied such a thing?  I dare say that I love my child every 
<br>
bit as much as I'm sure you love yours, so let's avoid maligning each 
<br>
others' motives, okay?
<br>
<p>Do you think that people who believe in using discipline do so to 
<br>
make their children's lives more difficult?  Maybe out of some sort 
<br>
of sadistic impulse?  Are you surprised to learn that we do it 
<br>
because we love our children dearly and want to make their lives 
<br>
easier?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Do you really believe that you need to come up against hard realities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What sort of hard realities do you need to come up against?
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  My income isn't infinite, so my wife and I have to discipline 
<br>
ourselves to spend wisely.  I've had to learn lots about my taxes and 
<br>
the business world, not because I enjoy it, but because they're 
<br>
skills I've needed to achieve my goals in life.  I have customers to 
<br>
keep pleased when honestly, I'd prefer to be with my family, 
<br>
exercising, reading, or playing video games.  As time goes on, I'll 
<br>
come up against other hard realities, as I and my loved ones are 
<br>
victims of crime, disease, or our own stupidities.  These limitations 
<br>
of life are what I term &quot;hard realities&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;   And yes, sometimes, baby has to be left in her crib to cry for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;few minutes before she falls asleep.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, baby does not HAVE to be left in her crib to cry. This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something you choose to do to her.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, when our daughter cried upon being put to bed at certain times, 
<br>
we let her cry for a bit before going to bed.  Training her to go to 
<br>
bed at a certain time early on means that she's now very reliable 
<br>
about knowing her limits concerning bedtime.  When mommy and daddy 
<br>
say it's time for bed, she goes to bed without many problems.  We 
<br>
could have done like my close friend's wife.  She couldn't stand to 
<br>
hear their baby crying, so even though the child is 3 1/2, the mother 
<br>
*still* has to rock the child to sleep and cater to the child's whims 
<br>
about where he wants to sleep and when.  The kid has an absolute 
<br>
panic attack if she isn't there when he wakes up from a nap.  You 
<br>
were mentioning &quot;independence&quot;?
<br>
<p><p>[Barbara's personal experience snipped]
<br>
<em>&gt;believe they WERE required to pass certain state tests for standard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff such as reading and math skills--is this not the case for all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CA schools?)
</em><br>
<p>Regardless, every year in the news, we heard about how California was 
<br>
typically somewhere between 46th and 48th in the nation in terms of 
<br>
how well California students scored on standardized tests.
<br>
<p>My wife taught at a private school that had a very traditional 
<br>
(somewhat Asian) approach to education.  Every year, she'd get a few 
<br>
public school kids in her class, and they were always the ones who 
<br>
had the most difficulty.  They lacked knowledge, they scored poorly 
<br>
on standardized tests, they had more conduct problems, and they 
<br>
required a lot more personal attention.  My wife felt that they were 
<br>
bright kids, but that public school had left them unprepared to learn 
<br>
in a focused environment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I think rather than more discipline, what's needed is for people to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand the learning and thinking process and to acknowledge that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;learning and thinking cannot be forced.
</em><br>
<p>When I was an employee at a company, and my boss said, &quot;We need to 
<br>
implement this totally different X with this new technology Y.&quot;  You 
<br>
bet your sweet bippy that I did some forced learning and thinking. 
<br>
That's the way life normally works, and to shield children from being 
<br>
trained in methods of coping with that is a tremendous disservice to 
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Here's an excerpt from an article by Katherine A. Dettwyler, PhD. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Abstract with references at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/BA/Aug94p3.html">http://www.lalecheleague.org/BA/Aug94p3.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the link, I'll take a look at it, although the excerpt you 
<br>
posted really was just a vague theory, and not scientific evidence. 
<br>
I'm looking for more of the latter type of information.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;   I'd certainly be willing to change my mind on the subject given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;some evidence, but currently, I find a 5 year old tugging on his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mom's bra to get a quick bite to eat to be more of a potential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;problem than a gain.
</em><br>
<p>[Barbara's own successful long-term breast feeding example snipped]
<br>
<p>Actually, when I mentioned the above, I had a family in mind that I 
<br>
knew in California.  The mother was a big believer in not forcing her 
<br>
kids to do anything.  The older boy was 4 when I last saw him.  Twice 
<br>
that day, he tugged on his mom for a snack.  He and his little sister 
<br>
are total brats - they don't listen to any adults, they destroy 
<br>
things, they have no sense of limits or.... *discipline*... and it 
<br>
shows.  Hmmm, I *wonder* how that happened.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
