Olbers' paradox is still questionable, as you can read.
<br>
<a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/news/5/1/12">http://physicsweb.org/article/news/5/1/12</a>
<br>
<p>It's interesting to point out that Edgar Allan Poe
<br>
made attempts, in his &quot;Eureka&quot;, to &quot;solve&quot; the paradox.
<br>
Indeed, in 1848, he stated that the blackness
<br>
of space between the stars was a glimpse of
<br>
featureless chaos before creation.

<p>I've also got this old file (below), in my pc, about
<br>
Olbers' paradox. But I do not remember who was the writer.
<br>
<p>Olbers' Paradox was so-named by Hermann Bondi in the 1950s,
<br>
after Heinrich Olbers who in 1823 discussed the problem:
<br>
why is the sky dark at night, indeed why do we see only the Sun by day?
<br>
If the Universe is infinite with uniform distribution of stars, every ray
<br>
must
<br>
sooner or later hit a star, and there would be continuous light.
<br>
Let us start from Olbers' basic assumptions:
<br>
(1) the Universe is infinite;
<br>
(2) stars are uniformly distributed throughout the Universe;
<br>
(3) the Universe does not vary with time;
<br>
(4) stars are permanent and unchanging.
<br>
Now compare a thin shell of space around the Earth with radius r and
<br>
thickness
<br>
dr containing n stars, with another shell with twice the radius.
<br>
The area of the second shell is four times the area of the first, and if
<br>
each
<br>
has the same thickness, the volume and number of stars in the second will
<br>
also
<br>
be four times those in the the first. But as the light received at Earth
<br>
diminishes by the square of the distance, the Earth receives from a star in
<br>
the
<br>
outer shell one quarter of the light from each star in the inner shell, but
<br>
as
<br>
there are four times as many stars in the outer shell, Earth receives the
<br>
same
<br>
amount of light from each shell.
<br>
If you go on taking shells right out to infinity, each shell gives us the
<br>
same
<br>
amount of light. If an outer star happens to be hidden by a nearer star, the
<br>
latter permanently receives the radiation from the outer one, and in due
<br>
time
<br>
equilibrium must be reached where the nearer star radiates the output from
<br>
both.
<br>
Hence the whole sky should be as bright and as hot as the surface of the
<br>
Sun,
<br>
both day and night! As this is clearly not so, one or more of the three
<br>
assumptions above, must be false. In Olbers' time, only stars were
<br>
considered,
<br>
but the argument is the same if galaxies are substituted.
<br>
Although Bondi gave Olbers the honour of pioneer, the problem had already
<br>
been
<br>
raised many times before him. Thomas Digges in 1576 recognized the problem,
<br>
but explained it by increasing faintness of stars with distance, which from
<br>
the
<br>
above discussion in not valid. Johannes Kepler, in 1610, found no problem,
<br>
because he rejected the idea of an infinite Universe, and believed that most
<br>
rays reached the boundary of the Universe without meeting a star For him,
<br>
the
<br>
dark night sky proved that the Universe was not infinite. In 1721, Edmund
<br>
Halley
<br>
returned to Digges' false explanation.
<br>
In 1750, the Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux, after thorough
<br>
consideration of the distribution and brightness of stars visible in his
<br>
observatory telescope, developed the geometrical argument stated above, that
<br>
the
<br>
decreasing luminosity of stars with distance should be exactly compensated
<br>
by
<br>
their increasing numbers. However, he did not abandon any of the four
<br>
premises,
<br>
but instead concluded that space must absorb radiation, so stars did fade
<br>
out
<br>
with distance.
<br>
This was essentially the explanation adopted by Olbers in 1823. He suggested
<br>
that interstellar clouds and dispersed gases absorb the radiation. But this
<br>
explanation fails in an infinite Universe, because the radiation absorbed by
<br>
the
<br>
interstellar gases does not disappear, it simply heats them up, so that in
<br>
due
<br>
time they radiate as much as they receive, and re-establish the searing sky.
<br>
Lord Kelvin &quot;solved&quot; the problem in l868 because he knew of no other source
<br>
of
<br>
solar or stellar energy than gravitational contraction, which was incapable
<br>
of
<br>
maintaining the observed energy output of the Sun for more than 100 million
<br>
years, so that any star that many light-years away would have burnt out
<br>
before
<br>
its initial light could reach us. This solution lapsed with the discovery of
<br>
nuclear energy.
<br>
The Hebrew, Christian, and Muslim doctrines, of course, had an adequate
<br>
answer
<br>
in their initial divine creation, because no stars could precede the
<br>
creation,
<br>
and even if they had since been receding with the velocity of light (a
<br>
limiting
<br>
asymptote) none would yet be 6,000 light-years away, less than a twentieth
<br>
of
<br>
the radius of our galaxy, or a millionth of the most distant galaxies
<br>
visible by
<br>
telescope.
<br>
Indeed, in 1848, the American writer, Edgar Allan Poe, stated that the
<br>
blackness
<br>
of space between the stars was a glimpse of featureless chaos before
<br>
creation.
<br>
In Ireland, sixty years later, Fournier d'Albe developed similar
<br>
propositions.
<br>
Indeed, modern big bangers are really saying the same thing!
<br>
However, I pointed out a decade ago that the universal background radiation
<br>
discovered by Penzias and Wilson, far from being the relict of Gamow's
<br>
imaginary
<br>
big-bang fireball, is in fact the real solution to Olbers' Paradox.
<br>
At the limit of the best telescopes (at red shift z ~ 4), there are as many
<br>
galaxies as there are stars in our Milky Way galaxy. But they are already so
<br>
faint as to be scarcely detectable, and the angle separating galaxies
<br>
averages
<br>
only 4p x 10-14 steradians, an extremely small angle.
<br>
But they continue on beyond, until the decreasing angular separation between
<br>
them reaches the Raleigh criterion, which limits of resolution of the radio
<br>
telescopes. This depends only on focal length and aperture. (Resolution of
<br>
two
<br>
wavelengths of equal intensity is just possible when the maximum of one
<br>
falls on
<br>
the first diffraction minimum of the other).
<br>
Beyond this distance the images cannot be separated by the telescopes and
<br>
fuse
<br>
into a continuous field of radiation. But at this distance, the Hubble
<br>
redshift
<br>
has gone far beyond the visible spectrum into the microwave band a couple of
<br>
degrees above absolute zero. Here indeed is the universal whiteout predicted
<br>
by
<br>
Olbers. In the best optical telescopes, galaxies fade out before reaching
<br>
the
<br>
Raleigh limit of separation. Those pairs within that limit appear as single
<br>
sources, not as an Olbers continuum. Indeed, the last sources to fade would
<br>
be
<br>
such optically fused pairs and triplets. At progressively longer
<br>
wavelengths,
<br>
Wien's law indicates that blackbody emission peaks at Wien's constant
<br>
(2897/T m)
<br>
that is a wavelength of about 0.2 cm.
<br>
At shorter wavelengths, the flux declines rapidly to a tenth at 0.1 cm, but
<br>
declines more slowly at longer wave-lengths. At the limit of resolution of
<br>
radio
<br>
telescopes, Oblers' whiteout then dawns redshifted far into the microwave
<br>
bands
<br>
(12 cm-1 cm), not far above absolute zero.
<br>
Far from implying a big bang, it would be impossible to have a Universe
<br>
without
<br>
such a background radiation near absolute zero. At the limit of our knowable
<br>
Universe, the redshift parameter would indeed reach infinity corresponding
<br>
to
<br>
absolute zero temperature, and the energy reaching us would be attenuated to
<br>
zero.
