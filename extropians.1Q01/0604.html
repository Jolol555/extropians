<em>&gt; Eugene, do you know if anyone's ever found capitalistic algorithms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating inside the apparent communism of an ant colony?  I wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make some point about &quot;If selfishness is so efficient, why hasn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved in ant colonies&quot;, and then I realized that for all I knew, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had.  Then I became genuinely interested in how, if a &quot;hedonistic ant&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm had evolved in ant colonies, the pseudo-selfishness would differ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from real selfishness.  You seem like the person most likely to know about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it...
</em><br>
<p>I don't know the answer, but what I do know is that ants within a colony
<br>
are all very closely related, all children of the same Queen.  They may
<br>
even be clones.  From this perspective the ants are in some ways more
<br>
like the cells in your body than like individual organisms.
<br>
<p>You might ask whether selfishness and competition plays a role in
<br>
our bodies.  Of course we are familiar with the ultimate selfishness
<br>
that occurs in a cancer when a cell reproduces excessively, but this
<br>
is a harmful state.  Are there systems which rely on competition to
<br>
work properly?
<br>
<p>One example I can think of is sperm cells, which compete to see which can
<br>
get into the egg first.  There may also be some competitive structure
<br>
in the immune system, where cells which create antibodies which are
<br>
successful in identifying pathogens get rewarded.  I don't know the
<br>
details though.  There are also theories of &quot;neural darwinism&quot; where
<br>
brain cells compete in some sense during the early months and years of
<br>
brain formation.
<br>
<p>Speaking of the sperm example, I've also read that bees use competition
<br>
to decide which get to reproduce, in much the same way.  The queen bee
<br>
flies as high as possible and only the strongest males can fly up to it
<br>
and mate.  I don't know whether ants use a similar selection mechanism,
<br>
but it would make sense if they do.
