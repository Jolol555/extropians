<p>This fits with my own views, mostly.  I haven't seen enough evidence 
<br>
to attribute temperature changes to &quot;Malenkovich Cycles,&quot; however.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you are

</em><br>
<p>(I can't speak for Greens, since I don't hold their views, but I 
<br>
think I have it right.)  They seem to have a consistent view of 
<br>
leaving &quot;Nature&quot; in its &quot;natural&quot; state.  I think they want to fight 
<br>
pollution because it harms Nature.  It does not surprise me that they 
<br>
see breeder reactors as &quot;unnatural.&quot;  Nor does it surprise me that 
<br>
they don't want to seed plankton beds with iron.  These seem to be 
<br>
consistent views for people who value the natural environment over 
<br>
any man-made environment.
<br>
<p>We do not need political agendas or conspiracy theories to explain 
<br>
their actions.  Even if I don't agree with them, I can see how their 
<br>
beliefs lead them to their actions.  They simply do not believe that 
<br>
nuclear power or iron-seeding the oceans is &quot;natural&quot; or as safe as 
<br>
we do.  They probably fear technology, and are more afraid of 
<br>
unforeseen consequences than technophiles do.
<br>
<p>No offense, but I think you are projecting your own beliefs (that 
<br>
breeder reactors and iron-seeding would solve the problem) onto them 
<br>
and then trying to rationalize why they wouldn't follow the obvious 
<br>
conclusion.  Your answer is that they have a hidden agenda.  I think 
<br>
the simpler answer is that they simply don't agree that breeder 
<br>
reactors and iron-seeding the oceans would work or be safe.  If they 
<br>
truly believed that these methods were untrustworthy, as either 
<br>
unsafe or unproven, I think they would follow their current course of 
<br>
action.
