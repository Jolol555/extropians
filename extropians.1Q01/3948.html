Scientists develop artificial 'skin'
<br>
<p><p><p>The plastic might one day be used for making artificial organs
<br>
<p>A self-repairing plastic &quot;skin&quot; has been developed and tested by US 
<br>
scientists. 
<br>
The smart type of plastic, which automatically knits together when cracked or 
<br>
broken, could one day be used to make artificial organs. 
<br>
<p>The material contains microcapsules filled with a special healing agent. 
<br>
<p>Like human skin, it bleeds and heals itself, offering a potential 
<br>
breakthrough in vital materials used in surgical implants. It could also 
<br>
prove useful for making rocket and spacecraft components, which cannot be 
<br>
repaired once they are in use. 
<br>
<p>Wear and tear 
<br>
<p>Plastics are normally susceptible to cracking caused by vibration, bending, 
<br>
and heat. Often the damage is deep within a structure, where it is difficult 
<br>
to detect and repair. 
<br>
<p>But in fracture tests, the new self-healing plastic regained 75% of its 
<br>
original strength. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p>The technology could revolutionise the space industry
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Scott White, a member of the University of Illinois team that developed the 
<br>
&quot;skin&quot;, said: &quot;When the material cracks, the microcapsules rupture and 
<br>
release the healing agent into the damaged region through capillary action.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The scientists are now trying to modify the plastic so that it is suitable 
<br>
for commercial use. 
<br>
<p>They believe the technology could revolutionise the plastics industry, with 
<br>
satellites, rocket motors and prosthetic organs prime candidates for 
<br>
treatment. 
<br>
<p>The research is reported in the journal Nature.
