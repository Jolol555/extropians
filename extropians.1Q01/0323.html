<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeah.  &quot;Why can't I, a world-reknowned jazz musician, be considered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sculptor?  Sculpture is nothing more than a barrier to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'non-sculptors' out.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>When you, or I, am sculpting we are &quot;sculptors&quot; ... so you can be
<br>
a sculptor whenever you like, though maybe not a world-famous one!
<br>
I also think anyone can do &quot;philosophy&quot; but that the peculiar school
<br>
of academic or conventionalist philosophy muddies the water and
<br>
needs to be got rid of, for clarities sake ..... it obscures rather than
<br>
clarifies. If the world of arty-farty sculpturing got too pretentious I
<br>
would criticise that also.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I am going to argue that your whole case relies on DEFINING
<br>
S&gt; everything as &quot;physical&quot; and not allowing anything to exist outside
<br>
S&gt; this definition ...  you can call it anti-realism or whatever, but
<br>
S&gt; your argument is completely vacuous and circular. If &quot;Principles&quot;
<br>
S&gt; and &quot;symbols&quot; and &quot;time&quot; are physical (ha, what rubbish) then at
<br>
S&gt; least you have to accept they are not &quot;physical&quot; in the same sense
<br>
S&gt; of the word as rocks or brains are &quot;physical&quot; ... so what value has
<br>
S&gt; this catch-all word &quot;physical&quot; ... none at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, it has some uses.  It has an intension as well as an extension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Physical&quot; doesn't just describe the set of things which do exist, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the set of things which could possibly exist.  It supports
</em><br>
<em>&gt;counterfactuals, as they say.
</em><br>
<p>This just proves my point. Not only do you define everything that exists
<br>
or has been thought of as &quot;physical&quot; but everything that hasn't been
<br>
thought of as well!  What &quot;uses&quot; do you have in mind, I find this
<br>
manoeuvre pointless. You are also committing a well-known error
<br>
by conflating &quot;exists&quot; with &quot;physical&quot; (the same strategy that was
<br>
used in one of the well-known arguments for the existence of God).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;More to the point, it seems to be in opposition to theories like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yours.  If &quot;physical&quot; meant nothing, or everything, you should be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to show that, under my own definition of &quot;physical,&quot; your theory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely .. under *your* definition of physical MVT is physical!
<br>
I just don't find any value in your definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But you can't do that.  You theory inherently relies on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-physical elements.  (Yet you try to claim the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high-ground and resort to name-calling with cries of &quot;medievalism.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>This is just the way we define things, I don't rely on any &quot;elements&quot;
<br>
that are not conceivable within your system, it is just that you want to
<br>
call everything physical. Maybe the phantom eye concept is one of
<br>
your &quot;counterfactuals&quot; .... but MVT offers several levels of explanation
<br>
and doesn't demand a leap of faith into the non-material. I am
<br>
happy to  provide a descriptive level how the &quot;phantom&quot; pineal eye
<br>
operates in terms of neural information, glandular and action potentials,
<br>
and thus is experienced in the same way that externally originating
<br>
sense-data/ neural information is experienced (as conscious &quot;behaviour&quot;).
<br>
<p>There is an ADDITIONAL level that MVT/ Third Eye (Kether, Eye of
<br>
Shiva, Dharma Eye) can be understood that is beyond and above the
<br>
limitation of your syntax and knowledge, possibly, but this meditational
<br>
awareness state is not what we are discussing, as I am aware it goes
<br>
beyond what can be described by biology and physics. Cultural &amp; mental,
<br>
yes, with &quot;consciousness correlates&quot; that have been identified by most
<br>
human-era societies as the &quot;source&quot; of spirituality ... but not particularly
<br>
identified with your Charvaka (materialist) view ... the philosophy of ash
<br>
(or dust ... the view that everything reduces to dust or atoms).
<br>
<p>MVT promises to reduce supernaturalism as well as materialism, in
<br>
that it explains phenomena in more natural, basic terms. I do not
<br>
think, whatever you say, that &quot;time&quot; and &quot;meaning&quot; can be transformed
<br>
into atomic quantities (dust in India 2,000bc was thought to be the
<br>
smallest particle). If your physicalism is anything more that a tautologous
<br>
definition (which I assert it is) then you should have some evidence that
<br>
everything is atomic.
<br>
<p>S&gt; &gt;Well, my physicalism denies that symbols are anything more than their
<br>
S&gt; &gt;physical part.  e.g. Writing is nothing more than scratches on paper.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; So all scratches on paper ARE writing? Ridiculous!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Forgive me.  Scratches on paper that are USED in a certain way by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people.  No non-physical component, unless you consider their use as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of &quot;logical part,&quot; which is misleading.
</em><br>
<p>But your physicalism &quot;denies that symbols are anything more than their
<br>
physical part.  e.g. Writing is nothing more than scratches on paper&quot; but
<br>
now in response to my point you add a qualifier about &quot;USE&quot; made by
<br>
them, which seems an intentional quality rather than anything physical.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Who apart from a philosopher would talk about &quot;meaning-object&quot; in
<br>
S&gt; order to deny straightforward &quot;meaning&quot; ... I bet you do not use this
<br>
S&gt; garbage-speech in normal conversation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't normally have conversations about physicalism.  But, I assure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you, whenever I do, I use these sorts of words and adopt this style of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, just goes to show how ludicrous philosophy is.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Not &quot;out there&quot; anywhere , this is just a lame assumption that everything
<br>
S&gt; is physical again .... ideas are properties of the mind (phantom pineal
<br>
S&gt; eye) so do not need physical extension.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Properties of a non-physical object?  No good.  As far as I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerned, ideas may be properties of physical objects, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;second-order properties of properties of physical objects, but at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end of the day, it must be a physical property.
</em><br>
<p>But this is pure conjecture, just your &quot;idea&quot;, what evidence do
<br>
you back this with? I can back up MVT with scientific experiment
<br>
and observation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;1 a : a comprehensive and fundamental law, doctrine, or assumption b
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(1) : a rule or code of conduct (2) : habitual devotion to right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principles &lt;a man of principle&gt; c : the laws or facts of nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;underlying the working of an artificial device
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2 : a primary source : ORIGIN
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3 a : an underlying faculty or endowment &lt;such principles of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nature as greed and curiosity&gt; b : an ingredient (as a chemical) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exhibits or imparts a characteristic quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;4 capitalized, Christian Science : a divine principle : GOD
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I clearly didn't mean 2-4 when I said that principles were arrays of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;symbols.  (And, hey, if you'd had some charity, maybe you could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen that.  This is an area where bad ethos will get you in trouble.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but my system can cope with ALL the definitions, whereas your
<br>
physicalism in my opinion fails to account for any of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Seriously, try to engage with respect and empathy.  Try to figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how I could possibly be right.  You just might figure out what I meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a change.)
</em><br>
<p>Within your strict set of closed definitions that everything (even
<br>
undiscovered)
<br>
MUST be physical, then you are right, but not otherwise. Anyway, how
<br>
do you (of all people) expect me to *read your mind* when all you give out
<br>
(and can give out) are physical scratches that I have to read literally!
<br>
You are what you say .... whereas I am far, far more because my view
<br>
allows for the possibility of any physical *or* non-physical properties.
<br>
I can identify with and &quot;understand&quot; fictional characters for instance,
<br>
although these fictions cannot be reduced to atoms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So I meant definition 1.  And laws, doctrines, assumptions, rules, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;codes are all statements, usually sentences.  Sentences ARE arrays of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;symbols.  But the key point I was making there is that even principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which are not written down as scratches on paper are encoded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physically in the brain: they are coded statements.  The brain is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;symbolic processor in this sense, just like the Turing machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Principles in the brain are complex arrays of brain symbols.
</em><br>
<p>But in a Turing machine everything is explicit, and somewhere on
<br>
the tape you can read these arrays. In the brain they cannot be
<br>
observed or detected. What are &quot;brain symbols&quot; anyway, I have never
<br>
heard of these .....
<br>
<p>S&gt; Are you claiming your strange definition is correct and *everybody*
<br>
S&gt; else including the Oxford English Dictionary is wrong?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, I claim that you failed to understand what I said, because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were looking for a way to make me wrong, rather than looking for how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or why I could possibly be right.  You picked the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpretation, instead of the right one.  See how that's a waste of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our time?
</em><br>
<p>It is not my job to argue your case or to pretend to agree with
<br>
you when I do not see any merit in your argument. If I have a choice
<br>
then you are not presenting a very water-tight case.  To be honest,
<br>
I still fail to see how (any kind of) &quot;principle&quot; can be physical.
<br>
<p>I don't ask you to  agree with my views unchallenged.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The brain can't *arbitrarily* change its hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; The brain is very plastic and continually forges new connectivity ..
<br>
S&gt; the *physical neurons* change ... and not just signal routes. Do
<br>
S&gt; you deny this? How can ontogeny occur at all by your account?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, I don't deny this.  But changing physical neurons does not imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changing hardware.  Babbage's Analytical Engine, a mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer, changes its PHYSICAL layout.  But it still can't change its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hardware.  The hardware is just the part that it can't change.  In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;normal desktop computer, the hardware is the stuff you can drop on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your foot, but that's just a coincidence about computers as we build
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them today.
</em><br>
<p>There are records of young car crash victims who lived an apparently
<br>
normal life, but on autopsy it was discovered that only 5% of their brains
<br>
had been functioning! If brain damage occurs at an early enough age
<br>
it is plastic enough that any part of the brain can take over functions of
<br>
any other part ... so you are wrong in fact on this issue.
<br>
<p>S&gt; But it isn't like the brain in ANY way ... the brain is distributed
<br>
S&gt; parallel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They are both equivalent in behavior to a Turing machine.  Therefore,
</em><br>
t&gt;hey both share the limitations of a Turing machine.  One of them is a
<br>
<em>&gt;distributed parallel system, and the other one isn't.  But (pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attention now) that is irrelevant to the claim I'm making.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Distributed parallel systems are equivalent to Turing machines in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior.  They can't do anything a big fast Turing machine couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do.
</em><br>
<p>We have already decided that *real-time* responses cannot be
<br>
simulated. Neither could a big Turing machine have evolved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does that mean that I'd build one?  No, but that doesn't matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What matters is that they share the same limitations.  Whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior the one couldn't exhibit, the other couldn't exhibit either.
</em><br>
<p>The brain can develop entirely new modules (eg. the neocortex)
<br>
in response to changing environmental demands, how would your
<br>
Turing machine do this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Neither one can change their own &quot;hardware,&quot; by definition.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong, see above. I suppose you might be right in the case of
<br>
some artificial silicon neural-computers, since these are designed
<br>
and manufactured, but this is not true of brains, which are plastic.
<br>
<p>S&gt; You persist with the old hardware/ software language that just doesn't
<br>
S&gt; cut it when examining neural computers .... there is not software, just
<br>
S&gt; weight-states ... evolution sculpts the response directly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What's wrong with calling that software, exactly?
</em><br>
<p>Because it isn't arrays or streams of signals (code), it is electrical
<br>
charge only .... there is no symbolic equivalent. You get  the two
<br>
types of computers to behave similarly, but the method by which they
<br>
reach this behavior is not equivalent or even similar. Your Turing
<br>
or von Neumann machine also has electrical pulse, but this is not
<br>
what you mean by &quot;software&quot; ... and nor is the same as &quot;weight states&quot;
<br>
as these carry different information than logic gate arrays &amp;c.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt;So, I'm not telling you that the brain's circuitry is analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt;circuitry of a Turing machine, but that the brain's hardware, the part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt;that cannot be changed internally, is equivalent to the Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt;machine's hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; There is not a scrap of evidence for this ... what studies do you cite
<br>
here?
<br>
S&gt; And which parts of the brain are you saying are non-plastic?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Look, I'm not going to *bother* to cite this no-brainer.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;characteristics of the brain are non-plastic.  The fact that the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can't change the laws of physics implies that the laws of physics can,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if need be, serve as the non-plastic element.  I'm not making a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large assumption here, but important conclusions follow from this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious point.
</em><br>
<p>The Laws of Physics might be unalterable, but where do these disagree
<br>
with the proven facts (can provide car crash refs if needed) that the brain
<br>
(pretty much all of it) can be reconfigured for different tasks, and that
<br>
cells
<br>
and neurones are constantly dying, creating new connections, and even
<br>
physically migrating during early brain formation.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Why *should* we do that ... why adopt such ludicrous and
<br>
S&gt; anti-intuitional way of talking .. nobody actually does this. I can
<br>
S&gt; make equally as strong a case that the physical is an epiphenomena
<br>
S&gt; of the mental, and that everything is an &quot;illusion&quot; and that nothing
<br>
S&gt; is physical .... but I would rather assume that both physical AND
<br>
S&gt; non-physical entities can happily co-exist. MVT allows me that ... I
<br>
S&gt; am not forced to adopt such extreme and unwieldy positions as either
<br>
S&gt; materialism or idealism (both worn-out philosophical jargon worlds).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Because materialism is scientific.  Materials can be scientifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;verified.  Phenomena cannot.  No other philosophical theory, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MVT, can claim the scientific high ground.  We need nothing more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the materials to explain everything material.  Why invoke the ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when we have a science of materials?
</em><br>
<p>But only &quot;materials&quot; can be verified (molecular descriptions?) by
<br>
science, whereas you widen the claim for physicality to everything,
<br>
even principles, which cannot be verified as materials. No  way.
<br>
<p>S&gt; All you are saying is that there is a lessening only in *degree or type*
<br>
of
<br>
S&gt; physicalness ... that the phantom effect of the pineal eye is less
<br>
physical
<br>
S&gt; than the actual cellular structure that has gone ... whereas I take the
<br>
S&gt; further view that abstract images can only be formed by an abstract
<br>
S&gt; sense-organ (memory of physical organ, if you like). The language
<br>
differs,
<br>
S&gt; but maybe this is not a significant difference .. the philosophy and its
<br>
S&gt; jargon just gets in the way here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you like.  But it seems that one way of using this jargon has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considerably more intuitive appeal than the other, though we disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which one has that status.  If you like, this may be an argument from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intuitive grounds as to which jargon we ought to use.  But this is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an idle concern.  Our jargon shapes the way we view the world and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interact with it.  It fundamentally shapes what theories we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accept and which we will not.  So, if that's irrelevant to you, we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skip the philosophy, and leave it up in the air as to which jargon has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more intuitive appeal.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, ditch the philosophy by all means. It is quite inadequate.
<br>
I argue for a post-human aesthetic that can embrace the
<br>
powerful new vocabulary and world-view that MVT offers. The
<br>
many various mental phenomena can all be described using
<br>
the evolutionary narrative (scientific) offered by MVT, whereas
<br>
the old philosophical jargon offers nothing. I disagree with you
<br>
that functionalism solves Leibnitz Law , by the way, on any
<br>
level other than by linguistic contrivance. MVT offers a constructive
<br>
reconciliation by means of the virtual generic sensor as a bridge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;My incapacity to point to something doesn't mean that it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical.  But no matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; I think you have big problems here ... the  essence of being physical
<br>
S&gt; seems to be that there *should* be something you can point to, or at
<br>
S&gt; least detect by the instrument of physics. Without any objective
<br>
evidence,
<br>
S&gt; your claim to the physicallness of such &quot;unpointable to&quot; things is weak
<br>
S&gt; at best ... and is eminently challengeable by idealists and others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Not very.  All physical objects can be pointed to.  You cannot point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at any properties, however.  Time is a property of a physical object.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is not a physical object, but it is a physical property.  Same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing with length.  You cannot point to two inches, but you can point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to objects which are two inches long, and no non-physical things have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the property of being two-inches long.
</em><br>
<p>God is a fictional character .... he cannot be pointed to so is not
<br>
a physical object ... but how is he a &quot;property of a physical object?&quot;
<br>
What you call a &quot;physical property&quot; could equally well be described as
<br>
a &quot;concept.&quot;
<br>
S&gt; &quot;Physical&quot; here might mean &quot;hallucinatory&quot; or &quot;mental&quot; .... fictional
<br>
S&gt; even? What exactly do you mean by &quot;physical&quot; since you use it
<br>
S&gt; to describe some very, very different things. Can one thing be
<br>
S&gt; &quot;less&quot; physical than another? If so, then you have a scalar system,
<br>
S&gt; and at one extreme of the scale will be &quot;non-physical&quot; things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Because even under idealism there will be a difference between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hallucinations of brains and minds.  The one will be a &quot;physical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hallucination, under that wacky definition, but even then, the mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;STILL won't be &quot;physical.&quot;  Same old problem, even under a radically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bizarre definition of &quot;physical.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Sure, idealism (an human-era philosophical device, like physicalism)
<br>
gives some bizarre conclusions ... but no more bizarre than your
<br>
view, and equally (or even less) unprovable.
<br>
<p>S Yes, which is why (if you have ever read any of my MVT publications) I
<br>
S&gt; am careful to avoid identification with any of the philosophical camps
<br>
...
<br>
S&gt; I trot out the idealist position just to counter your physicalist
<br>
S&gt; assumption,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But it doesn't help *your* position, because you fall under attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from both sides.  If I have to, I'll take the more general view that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it doesn't matter which is right, idealism or physicalism, because,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whichever it turns out to be, your theory is either wrong or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-explanatory.
</em><br>
<p>But this &quot;general view&quot; that follows from either idealism or materialism
<br>
does not allow ANY explanation of 'consciousness' ...so this bothers
<br>
me not in the least. It is the philosophical models that are wrong, not MVT.
<br>
<p>S&gt; but I actually think the distinction between phyical and mental is
<br>
blurred,
<br>
S&gt; the shape of the body changes the shape of the mind, and the shape
<br>
S&gt; of the mind affects the shape and action of the body (Aristotle).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Aristotle didn't know, just as Descartes didn't know, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical world is causally closed.  That was our original problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you'll recall.
</em><br>
<p>Quantum physics allows (theoretically) non-causal effects, action at
<br>
a distance and so on. We also cannot describe what &quot;Laws&quot; are
<br>
in operation at the point of singularity in a black hole. On macro-level
<br>
description, Aristotle seems to be correct. And we can think, plan
<br>
and mentally model (internal thought, not possible to E-2 animals!?)
<br>
action before manifesting it physically. The mind affects the body.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Read that again... I was characterizing a view which you might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;holding.  Are you?  I assume not, but if not, it's not obvious what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you WERE saying.
</em><br>
<p>No, I think that we can never be certain that we are not in trance and
<br>
hallucinating, but this does not mean that I think we ARE in trance all
<br>
the time ...  otherwise it would be problematic to make graduations
<br>
between depths and types of trance ...  but I do think that certain
<br>
individuals (Buddha's) might be more aware/ awake than run-of-the
<br>
-mill humanoids, and experience states not accessible to you or me.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Just word games, absolutely content-free!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If that's the case, then the difference between MVT and MVT' is nil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One has some extra non-scientific content-free statements.  Hmmm.
</em><br>
<p>I make it plain (I hope) that some parts are scientifically based
<br>
premises, and that there is a stronger case that relies on the whole
<br>
aesthetic, circumstantial and pattern-completion (elegance) case
<br>
to support claims ... which ultimately rely on opinion. But I think the
<br>
scientific observations and evolutionary account for why animals
<br>
&nbsp;behaviour that was externally controlled by sunlight and glandular
<br>
reactions in the pineal eye ALSO cover areas such as how ectothermy
<br>
became supplanted by internal (endothermic) behavioural strategies
<br>
and why this COULD NOT occur while the external clock/ pineal eye
<br>
existed as a cellular structure.
<br>
<p>I take the next step in drawing attention to similarity between properties
<br>
of
<br>
modern E-1 consciousness and the (known) properties of the physical
<br>
median eye (non-transferability, generic wholeness &amp;c, 6 are listed in
<br>
my book &amp; film).  There may or may not be experimental means to PROVE
<br>
that the old median eye is the template for modern types of mental phenomena
<br>
such as the pervasive &quot;self&quot; ... but the MVT account for how and why REM
<br>
arose in evolution, and similarities between night-time median (direct or
<br>
physical) vision in cold-blooded E-2 animals and DREAM mentation that
<br>
we have ... are fairly apparent.
<br>
<p>If the loss of the pineal eye explains how &amp; why modern brains AND their
<br>
accompanying mental life evolved, then this is our best shot at clearing up
<br>
associated problems (Globus' and Menakers's theories in physiology) and
<br>
getting rid of philosophical quandaries. I challenge you to suggest another
<br>
natural/ physiological scenario that resolves Leibnitz Law ... Putnam
<br>
just doesn't cut it.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I have a scalar view which is actually neither physicalist, idealist or
<br>
S&gt; dualist .... MVT is adequate on all explanatory accounts, whereas your
<br>
S&gt; fictional and unbuildable Turing machine view is no better than a
<br>
S&gt; medieval supernaturalist account .... you have no evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Name calling.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't call you anything here, just ridicule your idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And, I argue, the reverse of the case: MVT FAILS under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all explanatory accounts.  It's no good under idealism, no good under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physicalism, no good under dualism (even scalar dualism), it's just no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good, unless you resort to equating MVT with MVT', which is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acceptable interpretative manoeuvre, but makes your theory no theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness at all.
</em><br>
<p>MVT doesn't fail .... Idealism, Dualism and Physicalism fail!
<br>
Bye bye to failed lingoistic philosophy. None of these accounts
<br>
resolves the mind-body problem .... physicalism might try to deny
<br>
the mental, but still cannot overcome the Identity = Interchangeability
<br>
issue because the thoughts of the brain ARE NOT the cellular matter
<br>
of the brain, however you cut it (even as &quot;properties&quot; or &quot;conscious
<br>
behaviour.&quot;) They may correlate with, but are not &quot;fully interchangeable&quot;
<br>
since the language used to describe each type is different.
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; But your epiphenomenalism has to show that everything runs exactly
<br>
S&gt; the same whether people can &quot;think&quot; or not, and the placebo case
<br>
S&gt; clearly refutes this. &quot;Thinks&quot; is a consciousness term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I put scare quotes around &quot;thinks&quot; to indicate that I meant my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-realistic &quot;thinks.&quot;  It's the behavior of your thinking, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical part of your thinking, the bit that, formally speaking, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophical zombie could exhibit without having any thoughts at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thinking and acting like you're thinking are not the same; the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part is what I mean when I say &quot;thinks.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Simply by making the patient do the physical part, the placebo works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No mental elements need be involved.  &quot;thinks&quot; is a shorthand for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain states, not for non-physical ghoulies and gohesties which you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never observe.
</em><br>
<p>But if you claim this, then &quot;brain states&quot; and &quot;thinks&quot; are the same thing,
<br>
so you can substitute one for the other in any sentence without changing the
<br>
meaning? Is this what you are saying?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, meaning is as physical as an air-wave.
</em><br>
<p>I can measure sound in decibels, or with an air sock.
<br>
It has location, speed, frequency and other physical
<br>
properties.
<br>
<p>How do I measure &quot;meaning&quot; ..... what tests can I do
<br>
and what physical measurements do I take, using
<br>
what instruments?
<br>
<p>S&gt; But no one can read the internal state of a neural computer
<br>
S&gt; because it is a dynamic system ... the memory does not &quot;exist&quot;
<br>
S&gt; as stored until some hook or other activates a state similar to a
<br>
S&gt; previous pattern that evokes a &quot;memory&quot;. I think you are confusing
<br>
S&gt; &quot;program&quot; with &quot;constraints&quot; .... a neural computer &quot;learns&quot; by exposure
<br>
S&gt; to lots of examples .. and makes its own patterns from these ..
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; This is how a humanoid infant learns to talk .. by being talked to ..
<br>
S&gt; and listening to voices in the world, and NOT by being given a
<br>
S&gt; book on the rules of grammar or a English primer. Same with neural
<br>
S&gt; computers ... no programmers or software .... just reward for correct
<br>
S&gt; and absence or reward for wrong, and it figures out the patterns for
<br>
S&gt; itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When I simulate a neural network that does this on my desktop, is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exhibiting a program or constraints?  I'm not conflating these;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they're the same.  The presence or absence of a human programmer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't imply that it's not a program.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree that a serial simulation is identical with a physical, parallel
<br>
instantiation ... they may exhibit behaviour that we think is equivalent,
<br>
but one is algorithmic and provable at any point, and the other is not.
<br>
<p>Also I deny that you can even simulate RGA circuits on your laptop.
<br>
The difference is much the same as between a stage-play (simulation)
<br>
that is based on events and characters in real life. Your programmed
<br>
version is an artificial construct .... there are clear operational
<br>
differences
<br>
between the two .. which is why hybrid systems have been designed
<br>
to maximise the respective strengths of both systems. Connectionist
<br>
glue between von Neumann databases does seem to be more efficient
<br>
than either one or the other.
<br>
<p>Of course, reciprocally, there is not task that can be performed by a
<br>
(dumb but fast) Turing machine or von Neumann that cannot be done
<br>
using parallel distributed architectures .....  but I do not claim that
<br>
somehow von Neumann processors are REALLY neural computers,
<br>
or that neural architecture has *anything whatsoever* to do with their
<br>
design or evolution. They are just a (less optimised) alternative!
<br>
<p>S&gt; The link is in the identification with phantom pineal eye sensation
<br>
S&gt; as &quot;self&quot; owned or originating .... we &quot;own&quot; our thoughts and feelings
<br>
S&gt;  in a  way that your robot cannot, it is a closed physical system,
<br>
whereas
<br>
S&gt; we have a &quot;non-cellular&quot; component.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, this is not an explanation.  You don't explain why we necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a feeling when we have physical (in)capacities.  Here, you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;re-insist that we DO.
</em><br>
<p>The medical literature on why (in ALL cases of recorded traumatic
<br>
organ loss) we have phantom sensations explains this point adequately.
<br>
There is a necessity about such phenomena, not a voluntary choice.
<br>
<p>S&gt; The whole-part fusion of physical brain with phantom organ of generic
<br>
sense
<br>
S&gt; is enough to provide us with an experiential gestalt, we can reintegrate
<br>
S&gt; action-potential signals into the whole experience because our brains
<br>
S&gt; instantiate a sensor out of the very same type of action-potential
<br>
signals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No.  There's no gestalt when one link in the chain is missing: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;link between the physical (in)capacities and the feelings, on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms.
</em><br>
<p>The neurosignatures are generated along with 'phantom eye'
<br>
information thereby identifying this information as &quot;self&quot; originating,
<br>
but distinct from signals originating at the retina and so on.
<br>
I accept Melzacks' neuromatrix theory of self, by and large.
<br>
<p>S&gt; But you cannot move from &quot;can&quot; to &quot;does&quot; ... so your speculation
<br>
<em>&gt; carries no more weight than the supernaturalists, perhaps the
</em><br>
S&gt; Scientologists who think we are possessed by Thetan demons ..
<br>
S&gt; both accounts work in theory to cover any potential type of experience,
<br>
S&gt; but neither are true in practice.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; Start from the phenomena, look at how the brain IS constructed, and
<br>
S&gt; the case that the brain is a neural computer (or cluster of) is
<br>
irrefutable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Neural computers, all of them, are Turing machine equivalents.
</em><br>
<p>No ... as discussed above, I can simulate all the behaviours of a
<br>
Turing machine on neural systems, but they are not identical.
<br>
You fail to take on board my point that (theoretically .. and not
<br>
in practice since your Turing machine has never, and will never
<br>
be built, since as we decided earlier it is &quot;daft&quot;) the THETAN
<br>
DEMON of the scientologists *could* do anything your Turing
<br>
machine (until it ran out of tape or demands exceeded the
<br>
wit of its army of programmers/ homunculi) could do.  But
<br>
the two things are not equivalents. You accept that the Turing
<br>
machine is running neural simulations in lock-step (very fast,
<br>
but not INSTANT) .. and so you fail on your equivalence claim
<br>
just on the real-time property alone .... and I think there are further
<br>
differences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When we design a functional human-equivalent AI, it will obviously be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a Turing equivalent.  Will you be in the camp of philosophers who will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;insist that it still cannot be conscious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; Go ahead and do it ...... if you can. But even if you achieve it YOU
<br>
still
<br>
S&gt; deny it can be &quot;conscious&quot; because of your strange physicalist beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I asked you a question.  This was not an answer.
</em><br>
<p>I answer this point by saying the type of &quot;consciousness&quot; would be
<br>
different either from (a) silicon neural systems, or (b) E-2 brains ...
<br>
the type of &quot;self&quot; that self-referential consciousness has are different
<br>
by the very natures of the things. We are evolved, organic lifeforms.
<br>
I do not know whether insects have a rudimentary consciousness or
<br>
not, but if they do I suggest it would not be equivalent to humanoid.
<br>
<p>S&gt; And you are talking only about a &quot;human EQUIVALENT&quot; .. I and MVT
<br>
S&gt; are talking about the real things and how they actually DID evolve, not
<br>
S&gt; some simulation fiction!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The simulation tells us facts about the reality.  It's like how math
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tells us about physics.
</em><br>
<p>But the only simulations in silicon of EVOLVED intelligent are with
<br>
reconfigurable hardware and neural computers. And why look
<br>
at simulations in preference to the real things ... at best they are
<br>
a substitute.  I argue that the best simulations (neural computers)
<br>
are based on study and reverse engineering of actual brains
<br>
rather than purely conceptual models such as you describe.
<br>
<p>Maths is the language of physics by and large, not a simulation.
<br>
Big particle accelerator chambers &amp;c. and &quot;experiments&quot; are
<br>
the simulations of physical events, maths is just a terminology.
<br>
<p>I am interested in building MVT-based machines in which
<br>
components are removed and self-organisation thereby allowed
<br>
and stimulated (of both hardware or in software/ simulation).
<br>
However, while these computers might be useful slaves, I expect
<br>
to gain more understanding of E-2 consciousness (behaviour)
<br>
by using MVT model in a psychotherapeutic context. Real life
<br>
is better than contrived simulations and robotic toys.
