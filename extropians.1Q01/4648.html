<p>I apologize if my defense of Joe sounded like I was accusing Mike. 
<br>
That was not my intent, but I agree that my words sounded like an 
<br>
accusation against Mike.  I wish I had been more clear.  I was merely 
<br>
trying to prove that Joe did not start the thread by showing Mike's 
<br>
previous post.  I did not mean to therefore pin the blame on Mike.  I 
<br>
would have and should have done much further research into the 
<br>
history of the thread before blaming Mike.  I do not know that Mike 
<br>
was the first poster of the duel thread, and that was not the real 
<br>
point of my post.
<br>
<p>In my mind, there should be no blame at all.  I therefore stupidly 
<br>
missed the obvious connotation of what I said.  It was not my intent 
<br>
to blame Mike for anything.  I do not believe he did anything wrong, 
<br>
and he is only involved in this thread because of my ill-chosen 
<br>
words.  I wish I had been clearer in defending all participants in 
<br>
the thread, and not just the first victim of the blame-game.
<br>
<p>No offense has been committed here.  The g-word is not a banned 
<br>
topic.  It can and has been discussed rationally on this list. 
<br>
Anyone is free to mention it in passing or discuss extropian issues 
<br>
that might include guns.  If it develops into a flame war, it is the 
<br>
fault of the participants who are fighting.  We cannot blame an 
<br>
entire thread one one person or one side of an argument.  It takes 
<br>
two sides to have a war.  The whole search for blame is unnecessary 
<br>
and unfair to all people accused.  The blame-game itself becomes a 
<br>
witch-hunt where no original offense occurred.
<br>
<p>Again, I apologize.  Nobody is guilty of anything here except of 
<br>
being victims of an imperfect communications medium.
