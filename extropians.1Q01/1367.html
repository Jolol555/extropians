</em><br>
<p>...which leads to a question that's been idling in my mind.  I think I
<br>
know the answer, but I'd like to make sure.
<br>
<p>Question/problem: if physical immortality arrives, with attendant
<br>
ability to cure gross defects like dementia and senility, but stagnates
<br>
at that ability level for some length of time, would most people decay
<br>
into conservative, nostalgic sheeple who use their collected wisdom and
<br>
wealth to struggle to keep things the way they are, viewing young humans
<br>
and robots (sentient or not) equally as slaves laboring to support them?
<br>
<p>Answer/solution: it only takes one person committed to renewing their
<br>
own physical and mental advancement, and to offering such advances to
<br>
all of humanity, to keep the flame alive.  It is easier if there are
<br>
many, for individuals can be drowned out by the tides of the masses,
<br>
though if this went to its logical extreme the individuals could take
<br>
to hermitage, probably asteroid habitats given the tech level society
<br>
would likely settle at in this case.  This might result in raiding the
<br>
aging society for its younger members, not yet calcified in their
<br>
thinking, though one suspects that the long term revolution this would
<br>
help forment would be ignored if the short term production of the
<br>
extracted people was replaced by the extractor, say by more robots or by
<br>
improvements to existing ones.
<br>
<p>Maybe I should write that one up.  Make for one heck of a dystopia (in
<br>
the eyes of the newborn slaves), if nothing else.
