<em>&gt; 1. Wasn't the Gulf War about property rights?
</em><br>
<p>Nope.
<br>
<p>It was about enforcement of a UN Resolution brought by the Security
<br>
Council against a UN member and treaty signatory which had violated
<br>
an international treaty which it had signed. (Said violation consisted
<br>
of waging aggressive war against it's neighbour state.)
<br>
<p>At least, that's the official fiction. To the extent that the Gulf
<br>
War was about property rights it was *not* about British property rights
<br>
other than in the very tenuous sense of protecting investments of British
<br>
corporations overseas.
<br>
<p>Cynically, the war was fought to keep the price of gas down at pumps
<br>
across the US heartland in the run-up to an election.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. Weren't the British active participants in the Gulf War - using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lethal force to protect those property rights?
</em><br>
<p>The British were active participants but their official reason for
<br>
being there was nothing to do with property rights. Period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. Why is it okay to wipe out thousands of soldiers and more than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few innocents to protect property rights on a country scale, but it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not okay to protect property with lethal force on an individual scale?
</em><br>
<p>It's not okay to do *either*. Period.
<br>
<p>Please do not mistake me for the British government.
