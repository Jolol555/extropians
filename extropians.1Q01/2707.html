<p>Anyone know about how long it takes for these ideas to trickle enough so
<br>
that at least 50% of the people we would meet in normal life would at
<br>
least be consciously aware of having heard about these ideas, or what
<br>
that rate depends on?

<p>Take the &quot;true abundance&quot; thread, and advance it by however-many years
<br>
(probably centuries) of tech progress, but severely constrain potential
<br>
intelligence of AI (say, if even faster and faster CPUs can not increase
<br>
the non-computational part of intelligence), and that's about what you
<br>
get here.  Though one wonders why they would ever have to buy anything:
<br>
surely a ship like Andromeda would have been equipped with industrial
<br>
nanobots to strip some unclaimed asteroids or planets, then go into a
<br>
tight orbit around the nearest star, set up a factory and solar panels,
<br>
and make whatever it needed.
