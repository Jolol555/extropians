<p>&quot;Well&quot;, he says kind of sheepishly, digging the toe of his
<br>
sneaker into the dirt, I did leave you all the carbon,
<br>
not to mention the gold and silver.  Those are
<br>
8x10^25, 3.1x10^18 kg, 1.4x10^18 kg.  Actually, in
<br>
looking at this, I realized that I didn't adjust from
<br>
number fraction to mass fraction, so these should be
<br>
taken as order-of-magnitude estimates only... :-(
<br>
<p>And if 43 trillion channels is boring, you could limit
<br>
yourself to silver mirrors, but I'm assuming that that
<br>
is better used in the high temperature superconducting
<br>
cables in some of your computronium.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW. Don't you think that you would need some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptive optics to stabilize that mirror?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the mirrors are stabilized by electrostatic forces
<br>
so they don't need too much mass.  I need to read the source paper in
<br>
detail at some point (J. R. Angel et al, SPIE 4013 699-705 (2000)),
<br>
to see how much mass is really be required.  I would imagine that
<br>
large flat sheets of ice (very abundant) reinforced with carbon
<br>
nanotubes internally would make a strong enough &quot;base&quot; sheet.
<br>
These could either be positioned on the outside of MBrains where
<br>
solar light pressure doesn't disturb them excessively or located
<br>
way out in space in locations such as the gravitational lensing
<br>
focal points of stars (hundreds of AU from the star).
<br>
<p>The question is, can I image an individual dust particle at
<br>
10 light years with that much collecting area?  (Pls don't
<br>
take it as a serious question.)
