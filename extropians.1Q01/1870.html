<a name=sum><h1>Summary</h1></a>

<P>For decades, science fiction writers have noted the possibility of using technology to
upgrade the human condition.  Agriculture, industrial processes, computers, and other
applications of human ingenuity make our lives very different from that of our
hunter-gatherer ancestors thousands of years ago.  But the stuff human beings are made of
has not changed that much, and the resulting limits still place a cap on humanity's
potential.  We propose to change that, in a safe and effective way so as to gain many
customers - and so as to gain much profit.  (See <a href=#converter>Proposed Solution,
paragraph 3</a> for a quick example of how.)

<a name=prob><h1>Problem Statement</h1></a>

<P>Biologically safe implants have been around for decades, but the field has recently
experienced many breakthroughs.  Silicon chips that can directly link human neurons to
computers and machines have been a commercial reality since at least early 1999.  New
methods of growing human tissue are being published in science journals every few months.
Runaway pets can now be tracked with a radio tag inserted just under the skin.  Massive
investment in biotechnology seems likely to produce many more such advances in the very
near future.

<P>However, when it comes to using these on people, almost all of the applications are
focused on simply repairing or aiding people below the human norm.  For instance, prosthetic
arms and legs are used only to replace limbs already missing; anyone with an intact arm
which happens to be unusable due to arthritis or the like is out of luck.  Most scientific
papers on decoding human nervous signals are careful only to mention applications to the
disabled, if they mention applications at all.  The only significant exceptions are where
public notions of "normal" are already skewed towards an ideal, for instance with
liposuction and eye surgery.

<P>The main reason is not a lack of technology or interest.  Many professional athletes and
their support staffs try to increase athletic performance by any means possible, so long as
they can hide the more artifical means from sports officials.  Devices outside the body
which increase personal ability typically meet with wide support, as perhaps best
demonstrated by the worldwide adoption rate of cell phones.  Mood altering drugs have a
long history of use and abuse, including the two most popular modern ones, alcohol and
caffiene.

<P>It is mainly public perception which frowns upon seeking to improve oneself in this way,
and for good reason.  Modern history is filled with failed attempts to do so, with
publically tragic results - most notably, the eugenics programs of the Nazis, the most well
known piece of which is more widely termed the Holocaust.  Further, these attempts are
usually done by organizations which do not bother to address public concerns, thus raising
much fear even if they are in fact utterly benign.  A good example is the above mentioned
pet tracking tags: there is public debate about applying the same technology to certain
classes of people, for instance children, the mentally ill, and convicts, where the
tracking is justified by their classification; yet simply leaving the tag active will deny
them their privacy even when they grow up, get cured, or are reformed and returned to
society.

<a name=prop><h1>Proposed Solution</h1></a>

<P>One way to change public perception is to change the public's perceived reality.  If
implants that augment body functions achieve widespread use, few will continue to deny
their potential, and the path will be open for all kinds of upgrades of the human
condition.  Of course, the trick is to how to get that widespread use in the first place.

<P>One path that seems promising is to develop a few basic applications of the technology
and get it into the hands of early adoptors.  Standard market penetration strategies can be
followed from there, while the revenues are used to develop more advanced applications.
This requires a business to develop, manufacture, and sell these applications, and a
business requires profit.  Fortunately, there are some applications which do not require
much initial development, and should be rather easy to sell once on the market.

<a name=converter> </a>
<P>Perhaps the best initial application is a simple device that sits in a person's gut and
converts fat to electricity, by artificially stimulating metabolism and capturing the
resulting energy.  When the device's battery fills up, it could discharge to some external
device by induction (not conduction, since that would damage body tissue).  Later
generations of this device might power other devices, but the point of the first generation
is simply effortless, zero willpower, 24/7 calorie burning.  Given the number of obese
Americans, and the lesser but not insignificant percent of overwieght people worldwide, this
should prove rather popular - provided it actually works at a decent rate.  Since the first
versions may require minor surgery to install, we can also require distribution through
doctors, who will naturally act to prevent PR disasters like letting anorexics abuse the
device (since it would be their reputation, even more than our product's, which would suffer
from such an event).

<P>Another possibility is a memory chip or other data storage device in the arm.  This
would use the body as nothing more than a casing.  It could communicate with the outside
world via a cuff wrapped around the arm near the chip, with which it would talk via
induction.  The same induction, at higher power, could also be used to recharge the
device's batteries.  Among the potential applications here is medical records: barring loss
of arm, this chip would always be present and scannable by properly equipped medical
personell.  Another potential use would be data security: if all accesses to the chip are
logged, and if the log can not be erased without erasing the rest of the data, then - even
if any encryption were broken, and even assuming contact so slight the user never notices
at the time - the user will at least know if the chip has been accessed by someone else
(again, barring loss of arm, which would <i>definitely</i> be noticed).  There is also the
coolness factor (one possible catchphrase: "Let me download that to my arm"), though it may
be best to passively, not actively, emphasize that in case some people use active marketing
of this to brand the company as irresponsible.

<P>Further applications, for instance powering the above mentioned chip with the above
mentioned converter, or artificial muscles, or coatings to strengthen bone, or any of a
number of other possibilities, can be brought to market using funds from earlier
applications.  There is a potentially infinite supply of science fiction material dealing
with this area if our own inspiration runs dry.  Ideas are not the problem - implementation
and acceptance are.  Implementation is largely a matter of developing the technology and
getting it through the standard clinical development cycle.  Acceptance is largely a matter
of getting real world examples of the technology in use, to prove what it is and is not.

<a name=tm><h1>Target Markets</h1></a>

(Need to determine best target markets in detail.  Possible points:
<UL>
<LI>Access to trained medical personell, to do installation and in case something goes wrong
<LI>General public acceptance of new tech
<LI>People with money to spend on improving themselves
</OL>
Elective surgery market may be good model to follow, except eventual aim here is far wider
use.)

<a name=comp><h1>Competition</h1></a>

<P>As noted above, most potential direct competitors prefer instead to aid the disabled
rather than go after our customers.  Although this may change once we have established the
market, it is also the case that most such firms are large and relatively conservative, and
thus resistant to change.  It will therefore probably be years before we experience direct
competition.

<P>Indirect competition is another matter.  Modification of one's body is not the only way
to purchase improvements of one's capabilities.  A number of potential applications give
benefit to the user not because the device is inside the user, but because it is always with
the user - which is also the main selling point of wearable computers.  Any function that
can be done as a wearable, can almost definitely be done cheaper than as an implant, though
not necessarily better.

<P>To minimize the effect of this competition, we must market applications which can not be
done by wearable devices, or at least ones that obviously (to our customers) can not be done
nearly as well.  For example, many people carry laptop computers or PDAs today to take data
with them.  However, these devices can be stolen.  That is practically impossible if the
data storage unit is inside a person's body.  For another example, no device outside the
body can directly interact with a person's internal organs except under surgical conditions,
but something that is already inside can give its aid no matter what conditions its user
faces.

<P>That said, it is also possible to take advantage of these competitors.  Induced currents,
or data ports that breach the skin (once that can be done without risk of infection), can
communicate between our devices and wearables, to integrate both sets into a system.  It
may, in fact, be worth presenting this to customers as an analog to modern desktop
computers: that which is inside the body is the core system, which must always be present
and is slightly more expensive to upgrade (thus justifying higher costs for our products),
while that which is outside are mere peripherals that can be present or not at the user's
whim.

<a name=dopas><h1>Design Of Products And Services</h1></a>

<P>Take any basic action that people do, or would do if easily possible, on at least a daily
basis.  Add a device or substance that - or in major cases, replace some or all of the
relevant parts of the body used to do the action with a mechanism that - can do the action
easier, faster, more efficient, or otherwise better by a nontrivial margin.  Make sure the
additions and replacements do not interfer with any other functions that the natural parts
also do, and are safe for use with the rest of the body.  Finally, come up with a way to
cheaply install the parts, say by robots that will need minimal if any reprogramming per
patient, or by injection with standard syringes if possible.

<P>That is the ideal for design of our products, though Murphy's Law indicates that there
will inevitably be complications that can, or at least will, not be forseen.  Even so,
complicating a simple process merely gives a complex process, not an insurmountable one.

<P>Services will likely be minimal.  Any device that requires extensive training of doctors
to administer can probably be made more profitable by redesigning to do away with the need
for training.  Offering a community to our users, including tips as to how to use the
devices, will be more effective if viewed more as a cost of marketing (and thus, a freebie
they give out) than as a service to charge for.

<a name=oc><h1>Outside Components</h1></a>

<P>Most of our devices will merely be assemblies of standard medical and electrical
components, with shells to seperate them from the body except where interaction is desired.
Titanium and silver are good examples of biosafe materials, which can be dropped in the
body and safely left there forever, thus they are good candidate materials for these shells.
Medical and electrical supply are well established industries, with many suppliers in case
any particular one has problems, and the shells can be made from base metals purchased on
the commodities market.  Even those devices that require nonstandard components, for
instance the chemistry to convert glucose to electricity, will usually be mimicing or taking
advantage of some already well-known biological process, and it is usually the case that
there exist multiple industrial suppliers of the chemicals for said processes.  This aspect
should present few, if any, serious problems.

<a name=pdp><h1>Product Development Plan</h1></a>

<P>Most of the costs of developing products are expected to fall into two areas:
per-capability design, and clinical testing.  Testing our devices will be so similar to
testing drugs that this can probably be outsourced to a firm that does drug testing.
Designing the products will require laboratory equipment for each feature that the product
being developed uses.  Sample features include interaction with specific types of cells,
power storage, and data communication.  This will likely be a significant initial cost,
after which the existing labs can be used for new combinations of features.

<P>People are likely to be the biggest stumbling block here.  Given the public concern over
this field, and given as anyone we hire is by definition a member of society, care must be
taken to ensure that our hires know a firm distinction between the vague fears that keep our
would-be competitors away from our field, and the realities of what we are doing.  Safety is
likely to be a larger concern than is appreciated by the typical engineer in the field: if
our products are not safe, they will not sell, moreso here than with almost any other type
of product.  At the same time, our products must remain cheap enough to be accessible to
the general public if we are to gain many customers; safety, when bolted on as an
afterthought rather than being considered in the initial design, has historically been an
enemy of cheap.  Note that this applies mainly to the engineering side of the firm, while
the rest of the company can be standard for its roles.

<a name=mark><h1>Marketing Plan</h1></a>

(Need to find out what's needed for one.)

<a name=fp><h1>Financial Projections</h1></a>

(Need to find out how to do this.)

<a name=risks><h1>Risks</h1></a>

<P>The biggest risk is a PR disaster before we get many users.  There is already a public
perception of technology which seeks to break limits as inherently unsafe.  If we are
perceived to be merely the next iteration of what has come before, some well-meaning civic
group may well sue to shut us down.  This is actually a danger at any stage of the company,
but once we have real world demonstrations that our products are safe, we can more easily
get such cases thrown out of court before the legal bills pile up.  Best defense: make
sure our products work, and make sure our distributors have more at risk than we do so the
distributors do not act irresponsibly.

<P>Another risk is widespread rejection of our products.  There are people who actively
propose much more radical versions of what this plan proposes, however those plans are
rarely followed up because they lack any focus on safety, and thus fail to gather backing
capital.  If it turns out that such people are the only ones who would use our products, and
most people prefer to stay as they are rather than buy improvements, then our customer base
will remain small and stagnant.  Best defense: marketing.

<P>It may also prove impossible to cheaply install most of our products, thus keeping them
out of reach of most customers.  This would also keep our customer base small and stagnant.
Best defense: simply looking for cheap methods of installation, rather than assuming the
need for a multi-person surgical team and full operating room equipment.

<P>There is also some risk of government rejection of our products, if and only if they are
not convinced of the safety.  Best defense: make sure marketing emphasizes, at least in the
media the regulators listen to, that the products are safe.  Also, play up the day-to-day
benefits on those devices that can improve general citizen health.  And, of course, design
our products so they really are safe.

<a name=swota><h1>Stengths/Weaknesses/Opportunites/Threats Analysis</h1></a>

Main strengths/opportunities:<UL>
<LI>Can tap extensive research in field in ways that no one else dares or knows how, even
after we become visible to would-be competitors.
<LI>Emphasis on cost reduction may allow attack on large, established markets where existing
competitors pay little attention to end user's cost.
<LI>Once we have a customer, our products are with the customer 24/7, meaning we have that
customer for life (barring surgical removal - not trivial effort).
<LI>Human brain is already wired to learn how to use slowly changing body (most evoution of
this trait occured when maximum lifespan was under 30, so body grew during more than half of
lifespan), and our products are mostly a change to the body.
<LI>Early adoptors tend to be tech-aware: much overlap with dotcom millionaires and other
highly paid computer and biotech professionals, and with people willing to make devices
work without relying on us for support.
</OL>

Main weaknesses/threats:<UL>
<LI>Must aggressively counter public antipathy towards field.
<LI>Many startups in wearable devices, providing much indirect competition.
<LI>Initial distribution necessarily through doctors, rather than retail.
<LI>Can not effectively rent products, or otherwise charge on an ongoing basis.
</OL>

<a name=man><h1>Management Plan</h1></a>

<P>A standard Marketing/Sales/Design/Production/Ops division should suffice at the
beginning.  Marketing's focus is on the end users, and they are perhaps the best direct
contact with people actually using the devices, though care must be taken to capture the
data that Engineering will need to effectively upgrade our offerings and make new ones.
Sales would be more focused on the doctors and institutions through which we would
distribute these devices.  Design, of course, is responsible for designing and testing new
devices, including getting FDA approval (and, eventually, international equivalents) as
necessary.  Production is responsible for making sure our distributors have or can quickly
get our products, and thus would not exist until Design was almost done with its first
product.  Ops is responsible for supporting the rest of the company, including HR, finance,
and IS tasks, with probably more concentration on HR and finance since the IS needs will
likely be minimal.

<P>(Need to get people for those roles; first several hires should focus on being able to
do the basic tasks, with one or two managers at most.)
