</em><br>
<p>Nobody looks clean in a dirty fight.  Such tactics taint everybody involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Find the least charismatic of the lot and turn them into Hitler...
</em><br>
<p>This is obviously unethical.  If a person does something bad, then by 
<br>
all means criticize them.  But to target someone because they are not 
<br>
charismatic is to choose a victim because they can't defend 
<br>
themselves.  To &quot;turn them into Hitler&quot; clearly implies that they 
<br>
aren't as bad as they will be made to appear.  These tactics are 
<br>
disgusting and are likely to backfire.  People investigating your 
<br>
claims will find them to be lacking.  People trying to collaborate 
<br>
your claims will have to be as dishonest as you are.  People who do 
<br>
not play dirty will disassociate themselves with you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's not even intellectually dishonest--
</em><br>
<p>Yes it is.  You believe that other people fight dirty, and you want 
<br>
to do it too.  How is this any less dishonest than the enemy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The struggle to survive inherently involves some unavoidable negativism.
</em><br>
<p>We can react to negative events in a positive way.  We do not have to 
<br>
allow ourselves to turn negative.  Such tactics eventually turn us 
<br>
into the enemy we are trying to defeat.
<br>
<p>Why stop with the enemy?  Why not use such tactics against other 
<br>
transhumanist groups to make sure our particular group survives?  Why 
<br>
not use such tactics against honest competitors to free up more 
<br>
resources for our goals?  Why not turn on each other to fight for who 
<br>
gets to be the supreme spokesperson for our group?  Why not steal 
<br>
each other's ideas and not give credit, so we can amass these 
<br>
resources and make sure our way (the right way) prevails?
<br>
<p>How can anybody trust us if we use these tactics?  Nobody will be 
<br>
able to tell when we are playing fair or playing dirty.  Everything 
<br>
we do would become suspect.  I find no compelling reason to adopt 
<br>
these tactics.
