</em><br>
<p>Because it would be different from that way, then they could be compared.    For
<br>
example, some early motor vehicles had three wheels.
<br>
<p>If there are counterrotating wheels in the same inertial space, and the magnetic
<br>
levitation fails, then the wheel would take some other material not spinning at a
<br>
high rate of speed.  This introduces a variety of reasons why to consider systems
<br>
that reduce this risk.  The counterrotating wheels could each have a motor to spin
<br>
the mass the other way. We haven't yet mentioned good axles.
<br>
<p>I was wondering if the wheel was spinning fast enough with relation to the gravity
<br>
of the Earth that it would not spin in place until it slowed enough for gravity to
<br>
pull it to the Earth.  It would be an object more difficult to move than other
<br>
objects.  When it did slow to a speed would it contact another physical item, one
<br>
might envision a liquid barrier with high viscosity that evaporates into
<br>
near-frictionless material.
<br>
<p>So, it might be better to have two counterrotating wheels.  I think gyroscopic
<br>
effects can actually be used instead of avoided, in terms of gyroscopic inertial
<br>
effects.
