I think the explanation of &quot;IT&quot; which Max forwarded is correct, given
<br>
the links he provided (which I will repeat here as his message appeared
<br>
in HTML format):
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.dekaresearch.com">http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.dekaresearch.com</a> referring to
<br>
the Independence Transporter
<br>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/ginger.jpg">http://boingboing.net/ginger.jpg</a> which is part of the first drawing of
<br>
the patent
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.delphion.com/details?&pn=US05971091">http://www.delphion.com/details?&pn=US05971091</a>__ which is the patent.
<br>
<p>The patent is basically for the stair-climbing wheelchair, and shows
<br>
dozens of variations on the theme, but at least one, figure 21 (seen in
<br>
smaller form at the boing-boing link above), is intended for able-bodied
<br>
persons:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FIG. 21, it can be seen that a vehicle can be made in accordance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the present invention without providing a chair. The subject
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stands on a platform and holds a grip on handle attached to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;platform, so that the vehicle of this embodiment may be operated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a manner analogous to a scooter. The grip may be conveniently
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided with a thumb-operated joystick for directional control,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;although other methods of control may also be used. For example,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the handle and grip may be avoided altogether, and the platform may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be equipped with sensors to detect leaning of the subject. Indeed,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as described in connection with FIG. 5 and as further described below,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pitch of the vehicle is sensed and compensated for in the control
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop, so that if the subject leans forward, the vehicle will move
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward to maintain vertical stability. Accordingly, a forward lean
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will cause forward movement; a backward lean will cause backward
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movement. Appropriate force transducers may be provided to sense
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leftward and rightward leaning and related controls provided to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause left and right turning as a result of the sensed leaning. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaning may also be detected using proximity sensors. Similarly, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vehicle of this embodiment may be equipped with a foot- (or force-)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actuated switch to activate the vehicle, in such a manner that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;switch is closed so as to power the vehicle automatically when the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject stands on the platform.
<br>
<p>If he got that feedback mechanism working, it sounds like fun: lean
<br>
forward and the device scoots ahead to stay under you.  That could
<br>
account for Bezos' &quot;loud, booming laugh&quot; described in the tease document.
<br>
<p>If you could ride this thing around, steering it by leaning, going up and
<br>
down curbs, stairs, etc, that could really be revolutionary.  I don't
<br>
think you'd necessarily commute to work on it but for short trips it
<br>
would be great.  Imagine all the people you see walking around in the
<br>
city, or taking taxi rides of just a few miles, instead riding ITs,
<br>
right into the building where they are going.
<br>
<p>I have to confess, I've dreamed for years about a device like this,
<br>
a motorized platform you'd stand on and which would use leaning for
<br>
control.  I know nothing about mechanical engineering so it didn't go
<br>
farther than that.  But I'd love to try one.
<br>
