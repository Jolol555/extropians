<p>
actually, i didn't respond, because i really don't know much about that, and 
<br>
when i am ignorant, i have an instinct to protect and hide that ignorance. 
<br>
sorry.
<br>
<p>i really am interested in archeological sites, i used to read on and on 
<br>
about macchu picchu and aztech civ. (another reason why mormons kinda piss 
<br>
me off, here in utah, with their &quot;american history&quot;)
<br>
does anyone on this list ascribe to what i think people call catastrophism? 
<br>
where real advanced (well, more than conventionally believed) civilizations 
<br>
may have existed much further back than usually thought, and blown, bred, or 
<br>
diseased themselves out of existence? in the same vein are theories that the 
<br>
egyptians had a rudimentary knowledge of electric theory, that the number 
<br>
systems in ancient maya approached calculus level, stuff like that. it 
<br>
fascinates me, but it's hard to find &quot;speculative historians&quot;, i guess you 
<br>
might say.
<br>
<p>thanks for the in, to discuss something totally different, by the way. and 
<br>
yes, i did check out nan madol, and i wonder if anybody knows how many 
<br>
people are going there to look at it? will we see it in national geographic?

<em>&gt;Not a single response. Hmm. OK, maybe I *have* been under a rock and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone's just too polite to point that out. Yeah, right. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or maybe nobody here cares about archaeology. We're more future oriented
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than past oriented, right? Well, yeah, but we're smart enough to realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the past has valuable lessons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe everyone's too busy working riddles. But Nan Madol is real world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;riddle whose solution would benefit mankind, not just boost the egos of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who can solve it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm stumped. I can't figure out why nobody else seems to care...
