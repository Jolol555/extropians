Speaking of DNA sequencing, a month ago Damien forwarded,
<br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Science/2001-01/gene070101.shtml">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Science/2001-01/gene070101.shtml</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7 January 2001 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A medical school drop-out will unveil next month an invention which could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolutionise the mapping of the human genome and lead far more quickly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential cures for cancer, diabetes and other diseases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He has created a &quot;biochip&quot;, part cell and part microchip, by harnessing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;quantum physics with biology&quot;. The chip, Mr Densham will proclaim at its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch next month, can read genetic codes in a fraction of the time of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current mapping methods. 
</em><br>
<p>They were supposed to have more information in about a month, but
<br>
all I have found is their web site at <a href="http://www.mobious.com">http://www.mobious.com</a> [sic].
<br>
This has a flash animation proclaiming that gel electrophoresis is
<br>
dead as a DNA sequencing technology, to be replaced by their &quot;molecular
<br>
resonance sequencing&quot;.
<br>
<p>According to the limited information provided in the slide show, DNA
<br>
sequencing is done by breaking the DNA into fragments, which are then
<br>
sequenced, and the results put back together computationally.  This is
<br>
done via gel electrophoresis, in which the fragments are separated in
<br>
a gel medium.
<br>
<p>The new technique is apparently able to accomplish sequencing in a
<br>
different way, and its advantage is that it can handle longer fragments.
<br>
This makes the reassembly process much faster and provides for rapid
<br>
genome sequencing.
<br>
<p>One goal described on the web site is to monitor changes in the genome of
<br>
disease organisms over short time scales.  When a pathogen invades the
<br>
body, it is entering unknown territory with its own particular hazards.
<br>
Under those circumstances, selection pressures will rapidly change the
<br>
gene pool of the invader during the initial generations.  According
<br>
to the site, the bacteria that eventually make you sick have a very
<br>
different genomic composition than the ones which initially entered
<br>
the body.  Tracking these short-term changes will be possible using
<br>
Mobious technology and may provide new insights into the progress of
<br>
infectious disease.
<br>
<p>Of course another often discussed goal is to speed up sequencing to the
<br>
point where everyone (or at least sick people) can have their personal
<br>
genomes sequenced to help target medical therapies.  Hopefully Mobious
<br>
will provide more information soon about how their technology actually
<br>
works.
