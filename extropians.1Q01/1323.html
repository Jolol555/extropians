<p>Yup. The first priority of the world government is *stability*. So once

they've got a working system, they modify people to fit the system, not
<br>
vice versa.

sold a couple of novellas to Asimov's SF magazine that, among other things,

touch on just this theme ...)

</em><br>
<p>I'll agree with the &quot;optimally&quot;. In practice, that ain't going to happen
<br>
until pregnancy is a 100% *deliberately incurred* condition -- prerequisites
<br>
for which I see as including (a) very cheap, totally effective, safe 
<br>
contraception, and (b) universal sex education.
