<p>
I'm reading this book right now, and while I find some of Malik's critique
<br>
muddled or too easy, much is challenging and useful. The book is
<br>
impressively researched in sevral disciplines, grounded in the history of
<br>
humanism, and deserves to be read by anyone who thinks THE ADAPTED MIND and
<br>
the collected works of Dennett and Pinker are the last word on the topics.
<br>
<p>Here are two reviews from British journals:
<br>
==================
<br>
<p>Man, Beast and Zombie: what science can and cannot tell us
<br>
about human nature by Kenan Malik (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson,
<br>
£20, 470pp) 
<br>
<p>By Jonathan Rée
<br>
<p>16 December 2000
<br>
<p>It is exactly 25 years since Edward O Wilson published his
<br>
Sociobiology: a new synthesis. With its blend of new research and
<br>
vivid popularisation, the book changed the course of intellectual
<br>
history. The tedious charades of space exploration became a
<br>
sideshow, and the unimaginable formalisms of relativity and quantum
<br>
mechanics were sent back to the specialists. Evolutionary biology
<br>
became the public's favourite science and has remained so. 
<br>
<p>Wilson's synthesis promised to explain the whole of human existence
<br>
- mind and consciousness as well as body and instinct - in terms of
<br>
evolution; but its basic principles were not novel. The general idea that
<br>
populations tend, over the generations, to become better adapted to
<br>
their circumstances went back to Charles Darwin's The Origin of
<br>
Species. The same applies to the notion that biological progress
<br>
comes about not through will or purpose but as an automatic outcome
<br>
of blind natural selection. Wilson's elaboration of the mathematics of
<br>
evolution had long roots, too, and he was far from the first to suggest
<br>
that biological explanations could be extended into human
<br>
self-knowledge, reducing such conceited disciplines as literature, art,
<br>
philosophy and the social sciences to &quot;branches of biology&quot;. 
<br>
<p>The success of Sociobiology was due in part to Wilson's mastery of
<br>
the art of making enemies. As Kenan Malik explains in Man, Beast and
<br>
Zombie, there was soon an organised opposition called the
<br>
Sociobiology Study Group, which included Wilson's Harvard
<br>
colleagues Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould. In a letter to the
<br>
New York Review of Books, the group denounced sociobiology as a
<br>
right-wing conspiracy, an attempt to &quot;provide a genetic justification of
<br>
the status quo&quot; that had affinities with &quot;the eugenic policies which led
<br>
to the establishment of gas chambers in Nazi Germany&quot;. 
<br>
<p>A little later, a band of demonstrators interrupted a public lecture by
<br>
Wilson, pouring water over him and yelling, &quot;Wilson, you're all wet
<br>
now!&quot; It was not a very strong argument, and Wilson now likes to
<br>
recall his triumphs over &quot;the last of the Marxist intellectuals&quot;. 
<br>
<p>The hullabaloo marked the end of a century-long friendship between
<br>
Darwinism and those who liked to consider themselves progressive.
<br>
The Darwinist notion of the mutability of species had hitherto seemed
<br>
to rhyme with the leftist idea that nothing lasts for ever. And the
<br>
doctrine of evolution seemed to suggest that the human race was
<br>
riding on a biological escalator to ever-higher levels of intelligence,
<br>
health and happiness. It had always seemed as if Darwin and Marx
<br>
were comrades. 
<br>
<p>During the seventies, as Malik shows, all the ideological furniture was
<br>
rearranged. Leftists began to prefer sociology and anthropology to the
<br>
natural sciences, and it became an article of faith that changes in the
<br>
human world must be a matter of cultural choice rather than natural
<br>
selection. The new progressive conscience concerned itself less with
<br>
improving the wealth of the masses than with protecting individual
<br>
rights. In that context, the inoffensive truism that our capacities
<br>
depend on genetic inheritance began to seem like an excuse for racial
<br>
prejudice rather than an argument for equality. Wilson fired his
<br>
opening shot, and the science wars began. 
<br>
<p>Malik provides lucid and readable explanations of Wilson's
<br>
neo-Darwinism and traces its ramifications in modular psychology and
<br>
artificial intelligence. He also pays his respects to the opposition,
<br>
noting that on points of science they sometimes got the better of
<br>
Wilson. (They were right to insist that biological structures that now
<br>
serve one purpose might originally have developed because they
<br>
served another.) But in the end Malik cuts both sides down to size by
<br>
setting them in a vast historical landscape as participants in the
<br>
dispute between &quot;human exceptionalism&quot; and &quot;scientific reductionism&quot;
<br>
that has raged since the Renaissance. 
<br>
<p>Malik's governing argument is that science and humanism are not
<br>
really alternatives. Scientific reasoning itself points to the conclusion
<br>
that humans are exceptional, and explanations of human behaviour
<br>
will remain scientifically incomplete as long as &quot;objective causes&quot; are
<br>
not supplemented by &quot;subjective reasons&quot;. As Malik demonstrates
<br>
with force and eloquence, the idea of irreducibly subjective reasons
<br>
contains nothing that need offend even the most puritanical
<br>
naturalists: it does not rest on anything more mysterious than
<br>
networks of social relationships developed through history and
<br>
mediated by language. 
<br>
<p>Malik's attempt to broker a theoretical peace between hard-headed
<br>
Darwinists and tender-minded humanists has obvious appeal. But the
<br>
problem is a matter of points of view rather than theories, and it is
<br>
hard to believe that the settlement will last. Wilson once said that
<br>
sociobiologists try to explain human behaviour impartially, as if they
<br>
were &quot;zoologists from another planet&quot;. Malik operates from the same
<br>
perspective, though unlike Wilson he thinks that his extra-terrestrial
<br>
colleagues would have to take account of subjective historical causes
<br>
as well as objective natural ones. 
<br>
<p>But it is not so easy to shuffle off our earthly shells, and even Wilson
<br>
and Malik never come close to managing it. The paradoxical splendour
<br>
of the kind of popular science-writing in which they both excel is that
<br>
it consists not in science but in history. Sociobiology itself began and
<br>
ended with passages comparing Darwinism with the existentialism of
<br>
Albert Camus - themes that no amount of effort could reduce to the
<br>
principles of biological explanation. Wilson even allowed himself to
<br>
expound a &quot;vision of the future of behavioural biology&quot;, and his
<br>
prophecies for the year 2000 turn out to have been close to the mark. 
<br>
<p>But he reached them by reasoning as a historian, not a naturalist. As
<br>
the philosopher R G Collingwood said more than half a century ago,
<br>
the science of the mind may be far less arcane than natural scientists
<br>
would have us believe. Its proper name, according to him, is &quot;history&quot;.

<p>================================
<br>
<p>Book review by Anthony Campbell. Copyright © Anthony Campbell (2000).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>There have been several books published in the last few years which have
<br>
sought to diminish the importance of science; see, for example, Brian
<br>
Appleyard's Understanding the Present. The first thing to say about Malik's
<br>
book is that it is at a considerably higher level than many of these. It is
<br>
closely argued (and quite a demanding read) and gives the ideas and authors
<br>
it criticizes a fair hearing. It was reassuring to find, at the beginning
<br>
of the book, a rejection of the `social construction' view of science as
<br>
simply creating a picture of the world rather than discovering what is
<br>
actually there. Nevertheless, Malik finds an important difference between
<br>
science as it applies to cosmology, physics, and chemistry and as it
<br>
applies to human beings and society. &quot;When it comes to the science of
<br>
Man... matters are different.&quot; The analysis of this difference is really
<br>
what his book is about.
<br>
<p>Two scientific disciplines in particular attract Malik's attention:
<br>
evolutionary psychology and cognitive science. Both, he believes, have
<br>
seriously distorted the way we think about ourselves. Darwinism and
<br>
artificial intelligence seem to many to have jointly solved the problem of
<br>
how we should understand our position in a material universe, but Malik's
<br>
view is that this is &quot;an illusion fostered by the abandonment of any
<br>
attachment to a humanistic vision&quot;. It is also, he holds, the result of a
<br>
collective loss of nerve. Most of the book is made up of a large body of
<br>
evidence to support these opinions, including scientific arguments about
<br>
human nature, the impact of cultural and intellectual changes on scientific
<br>
views of Man, and the philosophical framework within which our modern view
<br>
of ourself resides.
<br>
<p>Malik presents a detailed account of the arguments that took place in the
<br>
twentieth century among advocates of the application of genetics and
<br>
Darwinism to human nature. He sees all these often disparate groups as
<br>
reacting against what he terms Unesco Man. This was an idealized figure,
<br>
created, according to Malik, by the United Nations Educational and
<br>
Scientific Organization after the Second World War as a reaction to Nazi
<br>
racism; Unesco Man had a rather simple and very plastic mind, to emphasize
<br>
the absence of inbuilt barriers between different cultures. E.O. Wilson's
<br>
sociobiology was a reaction against this, since it revived the idea of an
<br>
inbuilt human nature.
<br>
<p>Other views of how genetics and Darwinism influence human culture followed.
<br>
However, any simple description of these developments is prevented by the
<br>
complicated in-fighting that has gone on within science itself; for
<br>
example, between supporters and opponents of reductionism. Here Malik, who
<br>
has a weakness for jokey labels, identifies the Fab Four of 1960s
<br>
evolutionary biology (Williams, Hamilton, Trivers, and Maynard Smith) in
<br>
contrast to the Furious Five (Gould, Eldredge, Lewontin, Leon Kamin, and
<br>
Steven Rose), who challenged many accepted Darwinian tenets. Malik
<br>
concludes that the `reductionist' transformation of Darwinian theory has
<br>
proved to be broadly right, but that the attempt to apply these methods to
<br>
human affairs has been a failure.
<br>
<p>Animal behaviour, Malik insists, does not illuminate human behaviour. He
<br>
illustrates this with a fairly detailed discussion of Jared Diamond's claim
<br>
that genocide is a hangover from our evolutionary past. This can only be
<br>
maintained, Malik says, by using the term so loosely that it becomes almost
<br>
meaningless. He also does not accept that we can draw conclusions about
<br>
stone age man from how modern hunter gatherer societies are organized.
<br>
<p>The concluding chapters of the book look at the mind-body problem in
<br>
relation to artificial intelligence, which is where the &quot;zombie&quot; of the
<br>
title comes in. Malik has a fair amount of sympathy with Daniel Dennett's
<br>
views but does not think that Dennett has solved the problem of
<br>
subjectivity. His own position is that it is quite possible to be a
<br>
materialist, in the sense of rejecting divine explanations and accepting
<br>
that the only stuff that exists is physical, without believing that mental
<br>
and social phenomena can be explained purely mechanistically. If we try to
<br>
offer materialistic explanations for everything we end by viewing human
<br>
beings more as objects than as subjects, more as victims than as agents.
<br>
This, he says, is precisely what has happened. We have reached a position
<br>
where ridiculous deterministic explanations for behaviour are proffered
<br>
quite seriously, even in courts of law. We are supposed to be constrained
<br>
in what we can and cannot do by our evolutionary heritage, but by defining
<br>
what is politically possible in evolutionary terms, we limit our available
<br>
options unnecessarily.
<br>
<p>It's at this section that the book may become vulnerable to criticism, or
<br>
at least to misunderstanding. Malik would presumably admit that the human
<br>
body has been produced by evolution; human society, and consequently the
<br>
human mind, are supposed to be different. This implies a form of dualism,
<br>
which, as Malik acknowledges, is an unfashionable notion. Dualism, as he
<br>
says, can be interpreted in different ways, but in even mentioning the term
<br>
he risks opening the door to mysticism. This is something that he is
<br>
anxious to avoid. On his final page he censures Appleyard (rightly, I
<br>
think) for doing this (see Understanding the Present). Mysticism, he
<br>
insists, offers no alternative to mechanistic theories of our nature.
<br>
<p>&quot;To challenge mechanism we need not to retreat from reason, but to embrace
<br>
it, for mysticism and mechanism are both irrational accounts of human
<br>
nature. It would be inhuman to give up on the quest to understand
<br>
humanness.&quot; These are important caveats, but I suspect that some readers,
<br>
at least, will disregard them, and will quote the book as support for their
<br>
view that science itself is irrelevant. This would be a pity, for what it
<br>
is saying is important even if not welcome to everyone. I found that it
<br>
challenged ideas that I had more or less accepted as true for a number of
<br>
years, and it will probably take one or two more readings before I can
<br>
decide how far I need to revise my thinking. I suspect I will continue to
<br>
find more evidence for the importance of our evolutionary past in shaping
<br>
our present than Malik allows, but he is certainly right to make us think,
<br>
and think again, about the ideas that many of us have adopted.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I approve of Campbell's openness to persuasion. Malik, BTW, is a
<br>
neuroscientist and psychologist, and a notable scientific critic of racism.
