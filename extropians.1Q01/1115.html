Mystery Invention 'Ginger' May Be Motorized Scooter
<br>
Set to Be Unveiled in 2002 by Millionaire Inventor 
<br>
<p>By Eric Auchard and Tim Castle
<br>
Reuters
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
NEW YORK (Jan. 12) - The mystery invention code-named ''Ginger'' that has set 
<br>
the technology world abuzz may be little more than a motorized miniscooter, 
<br>
judging from a recent patent application that came to light on Friday.
<br>
<p>A Dec. 14, 2000, filing with the World Intellectual Property Organization 
<br>
available on the Internet at &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.wipo.org">http://www.wipo.org</a>&quot;&gt;www.wipo.org&lt;/A&gt; 
<br>
describes a ''class of transportation vehicles for carrying an individual 
<br>
over ground ... that is unstable with respect to tipping when ... not 
<br>
powered.''
<br>
<p>A picture of this ''personal mobility vehicle'' shows what appears to be a 
<br>
young girl balanced on a two-wheeled scooter. The patent application fits 
<br>
descriptions made in broadcast reports by people claiming to have seen 
<br>
prototypes of the vehicle.
<br>
<p>A proposal for a planned book about the mysterious invention described it as 
<br>
possibly more important than the World Wide Web and capable of generating 
<br>
fantastic riches, exciting a wave of media speculation over the machine.
<br>
<p>Harvard Business School Press is said to have paid $250,000 for the book 
<br>
detailing the device, also referred to as ''IT,'' which is set to be unveiled 
<br>
in 2002 by millionaire inventor Dean Kamen. Kamen's previous inventions 
<br>
include a portable insulin pump and a wheelchair that climbs stairs.
<br>
<p>A spokeswoman for the publisher declined to comment on Friday.
<br>
<p>CALLED EASY TO ASSEMBLE
<br>
<p>The invention is said to take just 10 minutes to assemble using simple tools, 
<br>
according to details from the book proposal published by media industry 
<br>
watchers Inside.com. Each Ginger object could cost less than $2,000. Top 
<br>
computer industry figures and investment bankers were named as backers, 
<br>
Inside.com said.
<br>
<p>In a statement issued on Thursday, Kamen, 49, declined to reveal much about 
<br>
the device, saying, ''While our projects are in the development phase and 
<br>
have client confidentiality requirements, it is impossible for us to comment 
<br>
further.''
<br>
<p>Calls to Kamen and his company, DEKA Research of Manchester, New Hampshire, 
<br>
seeking comment on the patent application were not returned.
<br>
<p>After seeing a prototype, Jeff Bezos, the founder of online retailer 
<br>
Amazon.com, was quoted as saying that IT ''is a product so revolutionary 
<br>
you'll have no problem selling it. The question is, are people going to be 
<br>
allowed to use it?''
<br>
<p>A scooter like one described in Kamen's recent application might piggyback on 
<br>
the popularity of Razor, the manually powered scooter that became a hit with 
<br>
American youth over the past year. More than 5 million of the devices have 
<br>
been sold, inspiring a host of imitators, Razor USA LLC said in December.
<br>
<p>NETIZENS SPECULATE
<br>
<p>Ginger was the subject of an hourlong U.S. talk show on CNN. On the Internet, 
<br>
debate raged over what the device might be, with opinions raging from 
<br>
enthusiastic to sarcastic to bombastic.
<br>
<p>Some questioned if the device was not, in fact, a personal Hovercraft, with 
<br>
the patent meant to throw the public off the real scent. Others argued it was 
<br>
an updated version of Kamen's wheelchairs or a sophisticated can opener or a 
<br>
clothes iron.
<br>
<p>''So what! This is all hype to sell a book,'' one skeptic said on an online 
<br>
message board. ''You people in the media need to be a little more skeptical. 
<br>
If it's so great, why does it have to be a secret?''
<br>
<p>Revolutionary personal transport systems have been revealed to an expectant, 
<br>
and disbelieving, world before.
<br>
<p>In January 1985 British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair unveiled his 
<br>
three-wheeler C5, a kind of surfboard tricycle in which plucky drivers lay on 
<br>
their backs and navigated the roads feet first.
<br>
<p>Powered by battery and pedaling, the low-level vehicle was invisible to 
<br>
trucks. It was immediately condemned by Britain's Automobile Association as 
<br>
''a hazard to the occupant and other road users.''
<br>
<p>Sales were minimal and production stopped within months. Sinclair's 
<br>
reputation as the distinguished inventor of cheap calculators and computers 
<br>
was in tatters, his C5 a national joke.
<br>
<p>A satirical song occasioned by the invention of the C5 contains the line 
<br>
''Don't want a Jag, don't want a Merc, I want to look like an absolute berk 
<br>
(idiot).''
