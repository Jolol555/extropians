<em>&gt; To your last question, no. In fact, there's no genetic basis for race at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all. Skin color is genetically controlled obviously, but what I mean is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no gross difference in the genomes between people of different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; races on the same scale as the X/Y difference in gender. If you were to come 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with a genetic basis for race, you would have to come up with some very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated rules, like &quot;people with Gene A but not Gene B or C are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered this race, unless they have Gene D (but not E)&quot;. Race is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearance based.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't figure there was.  However, I see it as an extremely cultural
<br>
'difference', not necessarily disadvantage.  Thus far, my experience is
<br>
that black people just do not like Math.  In fact trends in popularity of
<br>
majors amongst blacks are quite similar to the trends amongst women (my
<br>
data to support this is just the enrollment of my school and others I've
<br>
known who've headed off to college).  There's a heavy concentration in
<br>
liberal arts fields especially psychology, and if they enjoy science, they
<br>
tend towards bio-medical fields.
<br>
<p>I'm not really certain this is 'bad'.  Any who want to study
<br>
math/physics/engineering can easily obtain minority scholarships in such
<br>
fields, they just aren't utilized.  If the desire isn't there, why push
<br>
them into it.  Perhaps demographics will even out economically, but for
<br>
now, the blacks I know from wealthy suburban backgrounds avoid the
<br>
sciences as well.
