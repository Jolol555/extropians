<p><em>&gt; &gt; But our present system isn't working very well either. Not for the vast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; majority of people living within it. Most people spend the majority of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; their time doing things they don't want to be doing. For most people, 
</em><br>
life 
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; cannot be said to be joyful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This may be true, but the problem is this.  Almost half of all people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  live in China or India.  I've never been there and I know little about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their culture.  Any analysis of what &quot;most people&quot; do must be based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  lifestyles in these countries and other countries where the bulk of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people in the world live.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Most people are, by Western standards, very poor.  It may well be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  most people do not experience much joy in life.  I don't know; I've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  spoken with a poor Chinese peasant.  But if we hope to improve the lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of most people, we should not analyze their situation in the context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a Western middle class lifestyle.
</em><br>
<p>If the experience of China over the last 20 years is any guide, it seems that 
<br>
some of the basic material elements of what people call &quot;Western&quot; life are 
<br>
wanted by the 1.5 billion people living there.  Rural peasants in China tend 
<br>
to want to move to cities and get some fairly specific material goods and 
<br>
acquire a particular lifestyle: They want private living space (and as much 
<br>
as they can get), they want to be able to buy (instead of grow their own) 
<br>
food and have personal transportation and they want electronic media.  The 
<br>
Chinese population is consuming these goods and services as fast as they can 
<br>
be produced.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  It's one thing to talk about the future of the West, about the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  technologies and what opportunities they will bring to those of us wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and fortunate enough to be participating on this mailing list.  But let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  us not forget that &quot;most people&quot; are unlike us.  It's going to be a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  longer road for them to share in the bountiful future we hope to see.
</em><br>
<p>That, of course, is the issue.  What if that road can be considerably 
<br>
shortened by advances in technology?  What happens if billions of people can, 
<br>
in just a brief part of a single lifetime, make the transition from 
<br>
subsistence agriculture to having all the &quot;basics&quot; of a technological, urban 
<br>
lifestyle?
