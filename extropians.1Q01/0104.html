<p>Wow, cooool Im glad this discussion went down this path.  In the
<br>
past several months I have been toying with probability distribution
<br>
functions to make estimates of the probability of finding a new
<br>
record prime number in any given time span.  {Shall I change
<br>
the subject line?}
<br>
<p>Eliezer is right: to estimate a probability for living to see the
<br>
singularity, one need not first estimate a date, then estimate 
<br>
a probability of living that long.  Of course Gene, I did not 
<br>
do that estimate scientifically: I don't understand enough 
<br>
about AI to do that.  However, I do have some comments regarding 
<br>
probability distributions WRT the next record breaking prime, 
<br>
which I did calculate.
<br>
<p>Turns out, it is easy to show that the next record prime, and all
<br>
record primes henceforth for all time will be Mersenne primes,
<br>
that class of primes which are of the form 2^n-1.  The organized
<br>
effort to search Mersenne numbers {GIMPS} has four probability
<br>
functions that must be modeled:  1)  a linearly increasing number
<br>
of participants, 2)  the compute capability of the computers is
<br>
increasing exponentially, 3)  the probability of each mersenne
<br>
number being prime is decreasing logarithmically, and 4) the
<br>
number of compute cycles required to analyze each candidate
<br>
is increasing exponentially.
<br>
<p>Each of these factors can be expressed as a probability distribution
<br>
function, and the four PDFs can be superimposed to find that the
<br>
probability of finding a new record prime on any given day is...
<br>
decreasing linearly.
<br>
<p>Another way of stating this is that the inverse of the probability of
<br>
a new prime on any given day is increasing linearly.  For instance,
<br>
on 1 June 1999 {the day after the current record holder was
<br>
discovered} the probability of discovering a prime on that day
<br>
could have been calculated at about 1 in 160.  The probability of
<br>
a record breaker being discovered tomorrow is about 1 in 640.
<br>
<p>Record primes were discovered in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999.
<br>
The Mersenne Prime list was discussing yesterday that 2000 is
<br>
the first year since the GIMPS effort was organized that the record
<br>
was not smashed.  I had to inform them that according to my
<br>
probability distribution analysis, there is about a 63% chance
<br>
that we will go hungry in 2001 as well.  {8-[   dammit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think my grandparents are going to make it.
</em><br>
<p>I sincerely hope they do, Eleizer.  {8-]  spike
