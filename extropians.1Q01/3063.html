<p>**Yes; abuse is rampant.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;As with any law enforcement technology,

</em><br>
<p>**Good in theory; never happens in practice.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main, I'd think that it should only be used to search 
<br>
<em>&gt; for known criminals or suspects under investigation, in which case 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the proper warrants should be required.
</em><br>
<p>**Of course, but see above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Stakeouts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are manpower intensive. Not anymore--set up one of these doohickeys,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or several, near the target area--and automatically record and ID
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;everyone who comes and goes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would think that storing those records would be illegal, and at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very least such evidence should be inadmissible in a court of law.
</em><br>
<p>**Of course it would be illegal; never stoped 'em before. being 
<br>
inadmissible in court, practically speaking, doesn't really matter. 
<br>
Let's say I wanna nail you because I think you're buying smart-drugs 
<br>
from Mickey Megabrain. I set the things up, learn your routine, when 
<br>
you meet him, etc. Using that information, I then time my legitimate 
<br>
bust of Mickey (based on other evidence) for the sole purpose of 
<br>
nailing you. I don't need to admit the illegal evidence which led me 
<br>
to set you up. Nonetheless, the setup was completely 
<br>
unconstitutional.
<br>
<p>**But even this is not necessary. The courts have already ruled 
<br>
repeatedly that if you're in a public place, you're subject to being 
<br>
photographed, even having those photos published without your 
<br>
permission. Therefore, no warrant required to monitor public places--
<br>
through which we must travel to reach private places.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Their faces will already be on record
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;from drivers licenses. Set 'em up outside porno shops, see who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;visits. Outside areas where political rallies are held. At major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intersections. Track everyone, everywhere, all the time--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;automatically. Then just punch in a name and see where he's been for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the past ten years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I'd call those tactics a real problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; C'mon, haven't we all come to realize that the whole Orwellian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario never happened and it's unlikely to happen as long as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens don't become total sheep?
</em><br>
<p>**No, it never happened because it was too labor-intensive--i.e., 
<br>
horridly expensive. It simply wasn't possible to monitor everyone, 
<br>
everywhere, all the time, and properly index and cross-reference that 
<br>
info. Now, however, what ECHELON did for ecomm, this may do for 
<br>
people. Assuming it can be made to work reasonably well. As to 
<br>
facepainting, etc.--it will simply be outlawed, like those ski masks 
<br>
and hoods. Except, perhaps, on Halloween.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And no, I'm not advocating acting 
<br>
<em>&gt; like a sheep by allowing law enforcement agents to have better tools 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do their jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With this law enforcement equipment, technologies like genetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering, and freedoms like legal drug use, it's easy to see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slippery slopes everywhere that lead to disaster.  Does that mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we should just give up on them?
</em><br>
<p>**Of course not--but we don't have to hand them permission to use 
<br>
them against us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The key is to recognize and actively enforce the responsibilities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon the parties that stand to increase their liberties.
</em><br>
<p>**One would hope. Best of luck to us.
