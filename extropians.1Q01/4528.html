<em>&gt;&gt; I'm curious as to what you saw that was unfair about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;election.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm really rather tired of this subject, but will mention one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing of which I have personal knowledge: my brother, who lives in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Palm Beach County and has been voting there for 20 years, noticed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something wrong with his ballot when he began to use it. He took
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it up to a poll worker (probably a Democrat :-0) to point out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem and was basically told &quot;too bad.&quot; This caused him to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to choose between either voting for a candidate other than the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he had intended to vote for, or not having his vote count at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If this had been an isolated case, I could understand it, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not. I have since spoken with a number of people I know who live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the same county, and have been told similar stories.
</em><br>
<p>Although you did not mention it in this post, If I recall correctly
<br>
the problem you were refering to was the holes in the ballot not
<br>
lining up properly. I do not recall seeing any information on this
<br>
but I would be interested in any referrences.
<br>
<p>The poll worker involved shold be punished/barred from
<br>
participating in further elections.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Add this to the thousands of reported cases of this happening, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;votes being thrown out for various other reasons, of absentee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ballots not being counted or being counted twice, 
</em><br>
<p>Last I knew the majority of the uncounted absentee ballots were
<br>
from the military, and it was the dems who tried to prevent their
<br>
inclusion, so this would not have changed the outcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;of black voters being turned away at the polls due to rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspicious technical snafus, and various other problems, and to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we have a highly suspect election.
</em><br>
<p>Individual claims should be investigated. Some of the claims were
<br>
erroneous however. After the democratic initiated telemarketer
<br>
campaign was launched, the number of complaints was considerably
<br>
higher than the number of votes cast for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But this is all irrelevant to the response I made to your original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posting. The only reason I addressed it here is because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brought it up. My statement about us not really having a president
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was just me tossing off a personal opinion, and it was delivered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as such. I had no interest in convincing anyone of my point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view. Besides, there's not a lot we can do about it now.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there is little use in debating personal opinions.
<br>
<p>I was just curious.
