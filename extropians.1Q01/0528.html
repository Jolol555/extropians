<p>Strange, I don't see a single reason why it shouldn't. And a lot 
<br>
of reasons why it should.
<br>
<p>Because quite a lot is at stake if the SI is even uncaring,
<br>
I suggest to give the matter the benefit of doubt. Fortunately, 
<br>
AI is rather tough to do, as given how many people share above 
<br>
attitude we'd be rather far up the creek already, minus the paddle.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The first thing I would do when uploaded would be to leave the gravity well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and start mining the solar system for raw materials for a bigger and faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain. Until I was the brightest object in the sky so to speak ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Can you guarantee that you'll be the single one to do so, preventing
<br>
egress of others? If not, can you guarantee what your peers will and 
<br>
will not do? Can you at all make meaningful statements about MaxM++'s 
<br>
strategy, today? 
<br>
<p>And why have I to repeat above arguments, all of time, year after year?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So much wealth up there and so little time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should I bother about the earth? There is too much energy and materal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elsewhere and I wouldn't have to fight no one to get it either. Well not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beginning anyway.
</em><br>
<p>Right, not in the beginning. But rather soon, and soon in our current use of
<br>
the word. So as soon the Diaspora ran out of easily minable resources in its
<br>
exponential runaway, it's going to turn to less easily minable resources. 
<br>
A 500 km space rock makes for a lot of gadgetry, if disassembled. 
<br>
You'd be surface pitted against volume (imagine how much volume you'll fill
<br>
with asteroids, comets, space junk, satellites from Saturnian and Jovian
<br>
system, and Mercury, Moon, Mars, and the like), and low-tech surface at that. 
<br>
Even without nanotechnology, and with suboptimal use this more than enough
<br>
to eclipse the Sun (hey, you don't have to burn off the atmosphere/hydrosphere,
<br>
you can simply shade it off and freeze it out). If you're outmanned, outteched 
<br>
and outgunned by nine orders of magnitude at the very least, your chances are, 
<br>
how to put it midly, somewhat limited.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I guess that other uploads would do the same. There would still be limits in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth due to the speed of light, though massively parallel use of nanotech
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how the light cone should concern those who're sitting at the
<br>
origin. If you mean communication lag, then I don't see the point why
<br>
I should wait for something in lightminute distances. I just go ahead with
<br>
my daily business in the here and now. If there's something in my reach
<br>
or if I'm ejected from my niche I'll go around wandering. Hmm, nice tasty
<br>
planet snack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; could help on that. But probably a better use of my time would be to make my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain smarter instead of just making it bigger.
</em><br>
<p>There's a limit as to how many OPs/s you can extract from a chunk of matter
<br>
in a classical computation, and you'll very quickly reach that limit with
<br>
molecular circuitry of the second and third generation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't see why I should stay on earth to do that either.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't see what should keep you and your offspring from coming back,
<br>
and tearing this place apart for resources.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Most likely the best strategy would be some kind of tradeoff between a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of different factors. Brain speed, Intelligence level, production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability, growth speed etc. to name a few, including some I cannot even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehend now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But why I should even bother to look back on earth I don't know.
</em><br>
<p>If you don't multiply, somebody else will. The substrate dish is rather
<br>
large, so those who multiply fastest, will dominate. Why they should
<br>
suddenly stop multiplying and back off when they run out of resources, 
<br>
and have to disassemble the Earth I do not see.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It could be fun to play out a scenario based on SI and it's spreading in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Solar system. But I must agree with Eliezer that if Nano comes before SI we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be in grave trouble.
</em><br>
<p>It is difficult to see why AI (and very soon after, SI) should wait very long
<br>
after the advent of useful nano. Molecular circuitry is easiest to do by
<br>
self-assembly, which is a distinctly weaker technology than machine-phase
<br>
mechanosynthetic self-replicating nanorobotics it it's matter-manipulating
<br>
aspect. Which probably means that we'll get AI first, unless we continue to
<br>
insist perpetuating our broken approach to software design, of course.
<br>
<p>An AI in a positive feedback runaway is going to invent a lot of stuff,
<br>
so you can assume nanorobotics will be there instantly after SI is there,
<br>
from human time scale point of view.
