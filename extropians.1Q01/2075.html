<em>&gt; &gt; But then we did have a 10-day 'war' 10 years ago, in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something like 10 Slovenians died. (Duh, all 10-s) During
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that period, it was quite possible to hear more than 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gunshots. Ah well, nobody's perfect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And how many people were forced out?
</em><br>
<p>Close to 0. Slovenians, that is. As for Serbians and other &quot;southern
<br>
brothers&quot; who live and used to live in Slovenia - after the 'war', our
<br>
society didn't treat them very well for some time, and several may have been
<br>
deported from our country. The treatment in those years wasn't exactly
<br>
correct - mostly because people were angry at Serbs for sending tanks to our
<br>
country, and at Croatians for allowing the tanks to pass through. When the
<br>
Yugo army headed for Slovenia on Croatian highways, Croatians even cheered
<br>
the tanks, just to have them return after 10 days to start a war with
<br>
Croatians instead...
<br>
<p>By the way, I recently found that the total number of deaths in that 'war'
<br>
of ours was 64, on both sides. As far as I recall, the majority of these
<br>
deaths was on the side of the Yugo army.
<br>
<p>Note also that we didn't win because we somehow 'overforced' the Yugo army,
<br>
as the popular belief seems to be (?), but because the army withdrew on its
<br>
own accord. Presumably because someone, possibly Milosevic, realized that
<br>
we're too far away and that Croatia is a more imminent threat. Croatia,
<br>
Bosnia and Kosovo - all of them directly neighbouring to Serbia - then
<br>
suffered incredibly more than we ever did.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't think the propaganda you've been hearing is accurate.
</em><br>
<p>Well... the conflict did last something like 10 days, one could see that
<br>
with one's own eyes. As for the number of killings, I gathered that from
<br>
international sources by browsing the web.
<br>
<p>In general, I try _not_ to rely on mainstream sources of information. (Which
<br>
is why I don't like CNN - owned by that fine BBS sysop, Mr Steve Case - but
<br>
as far as TV news are concerned, there doesn't seem to be a good
<br>
alternative...)
