<em>&gt; I assume that [do-gooders] do sometimes change their non-bond-market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior in ways that helps the social policy, but this doesn't help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them unless they also have private info about whether they will help,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and buy more bonds when they privately know they will help.
</em><br>
<p>I'm still not getting it, Robin.  My supposition was that some do-gooders 
<br>
would decide whether or not to help depending on whether they were able to 
<br>
buy enough bonds to repay the effort.  This doesn't sound like your &quot;unless 
<br>
they also have private info about whether they will help&quot;, which seems much 
<br>
more passive.  You seem to be drawing causality the other direction: if 
<br>
they know they will help address the policy issue, then they buy more 
<br>
bonds.  In that case, you're right that they can't make money unless they 
<br>
know more than other experts about how many people will work on the issue.
<br>
<p>My interpretation of the value of the bonds has the causality in the other 
<br>
direction for at least some people.  They invest in a bond issue in which 
<br>
they could help address the issue.  (They might actually invest widely in 
<br>
these bonds so there are more issues that they would conditionally effect.) 
<br>
&nbsp;When they amass a sufficient stake in one issue, they decide to move on 
<br>
actually doing the work.  If they can't get enough, they move their 
<br>
attention elsewhere.
<br>
<p>This is also supposed to be one of the strong points of Idea Futures.  IF 
<br>
provides incentive for effort to be placed in areas where someone has 
<br>
invested.  Some polymaths can decide where to spend their investigation 
<br>
time based on which market they have collected sufficient coupons to make a 
<br>
sufficient return on.
