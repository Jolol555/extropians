None from me; I said the same thing. Except--you can't legislate that 
<br>
citizens MUST carry the things--only the cops.

<p>&nbsp;If you put all these lines together, they seem to me to point 
<br>
<em>&gt; strongly in the direction of making all interactions with government actors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freely recordable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is what I had in mind when I posted yesterday about the development of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new presumption regarding evidence derived from near-future PDAs.  If I were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sitting on the bench, faced with a questionable arrest in 2015, I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect to see at LEAST two distinct recordings of the events in question; one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from the police and one from the defendant.  The absence of the defendant's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recording would automatically make the legality of the arrest suspect and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shift the burden to the police to establish that it was constitutional.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, how would such a presumption impact police behavior?  One, it would make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them very careful not to interfere with a citizen's PDA, if she had one.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two, it would encourage people who believe that they might be subject to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improper police behavior to get and maintain PDAs.  Three, it would encourage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the police to develop and maintain the best possible recording equipment, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the best possible security against tampering - by the police or anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else.  Finally, it would create on the part of the government a keen interest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the development and implementation of secure, tamper-proof data protocols 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for EVERYONE, police and citizen alike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Criticisms?
