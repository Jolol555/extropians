</em><br>
<p>Thanks for your contribution. I think this has gotten a bit out of the
<br>
intent of the original comment. Blaikie was trying to insinuate that I
<br>
was some how racist or something of the sort by trying to get me to say
<br>
that only *some* types of people can live in a libertarian or a stable
<br>
democratic society. Greg, I think, has made a far more cogent argument
<br>
that is in the vein of the point I am trying to make, namely that
<br>
societies which are low-trust tend to be rather unstable and in *need*
<br>
of a rather repressive government using systematized violence to
<br>
maintain stability, or else such societies must accept high levels of
<br>
instability and random violence. I've often said that societies tend to
<br>
get the government they deserve (whether its self or externally
<br>
imposed). Societies that are high-trust tend toward libertarian
<br>
societies. When such societies are subject to immigration from low-trust
<br>
societies, then destabilization occurs, trust decreases, and governments
<br>
try to re-establish equilibrium at a lower level of trust and greater
<br>
government power, rather than trying to educate or assimilate immigrants
<br>
into high-trust modes of thought, based on dim-witted ideas about
<br>
'cultural preservation', etc.
<br>
<p>This is not a new phenomenon, as the comments about lines illustrates.
<br>
George Orwell commented on this in the 30's with respect to jewish
<br>
refugees from eastern europe living in Britain. He noticed that when
<br>
there were few immigrants, the normal british civility would quickly
<br>
train them to the ideas of trust involved in line waiting, but when
<br>
neighborhoods became overwhelmed with easterners, the normally quiet and
<br>
polite bus lines quickly devolved into pushing, shoving, shouting and
<br>
punching matches.
<br>
<p>Because of this, societies which resist becoming 'high trust' societies
<br>
will tend to employ high levels of violence in opposing such societies.
<br>
In order to overcome such low trust societies, high trust societies must
<br>
in many cases meet the level of resistance with a relfective level of
<br>
opressive violence until the society is assimilated or else give up on
<br>
assimilation.
<br>
<p>Here in North and South American, and in Australia as well, the accident
<br>
of disease and the 'virgin field' decimated prior societies, while the
<br>
introduction of the horse created additional destabilization to the
<br>
native society. The native societies faced by europeans, when europeans
<br>
actually faced them were generally (not in every case of course) already
<br>
drastically different from the societies that existed prior to the
<br>
original conquistador period. Midwest tribes had transformed from
<br>
stationary agricultural cultures that traded widely and were generally
<br>
high trust nations to nomadic buffalo hunting cultures, for example.
<br>
Because of these destabilizations, native cultures had become low-trust
<br>
cultures that were resistant to returning to the sedentary agricultural
<br>
high trust culture of their forebears.
