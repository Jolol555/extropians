Admittedly humans have serious reasoning and communications limitations
<br>
but can that excuse such rampant metaphorical and analogical abuse?  By
<br>
the flawed analogy, I prefer to eat actually nourishing food but will
<br>
eat junk food if nothing else is available or I am lazy.  I forego
<br>
poison entirely as much as is possible in a world where one
<br>
occassionally has to wade across a poisoned swamp to get to some
<br>
nourishment.  And I try to point out poisons so others can avoid it and
<br>
perhaps help to clean it up.
