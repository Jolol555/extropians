<br>
(Reply to <a href="mailto:mikegrossb@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Libertarian%20Futurist%20Society%20Announces%20First%20National%20Conference&In-Reply-To=&lt;v04220814b69f4bb6d4fd@[198.4.94.179]&gt;">mikegrossb@aol.com</a>)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Libertarian Futurist Society will celebrate its 20th anniversary by
<br>
sponsoring its first national conference May 25-27 at Marcon 36 at the Hyatt
<br>
Regency hotel and Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LFScon will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear Prometheus Award
<br>
winners and LFS leaders explore the future of freedom and the potential of
<br>
libertarian science fiction to shape a more rational, diverse, tolerant and
<br>
optimistic vision of what is possible in the 21st and coming centuries.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Libertarian Futurist Society will present its 2001 Prometheus Hall of
<br>
Fame awards ceremony before an audience of more than 1,500 people during the
<br>
intermission of Marcon's Saturday night masquerade-- its most popular event.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LFScon will feature more Prometheus Awardwinning novelists than any other
<br>
sf convention or libertarian conference in history.  So far, the LFS has
<br>
confirmed eight Prometheus Awardwinners, who collectively have won 11 Best
<br>
Novel awards and five Hall of Fame awards: special LFScon Guest of Honor L.
<br>
Neil Smith (The Probability Broach, Pallas), Poul Anderson (Trader to the
<br>
Stars, The Stars are Also Fire, The Star Fox), F. Paul Wilson (Healer, Wheels
<br>
within Wheels, An Enemy of the State), James Hogan (Voyage From Yesteryear,
<br>
The Multiplex Man), Vernor Vinge (Marooned in Realtime, A Deepness in the
<br>
Sky), J. Neil Schulman (Alongside Night, The Rainbow Cadenza), Brad
<br>
Linaweaver (Moon of Ice) and Victor Milan (The Cybernetic Samurai.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcon and LFScon are jointly planning a major LFScon program track,
<br>
with a dozen major panels on libertarian themes, including:
<br>

<br>
full panel of our Prometheus Awardwinners;
<br>
* Will the Future Be More or Less Free?
<br>
* Who Wants to Be a Zillionaire in Space?- A Free Market Approach to
<br>
Exploring, Industrializing and Colonizing the Solar System
<br>
* Intelligent Self-Defense, the 2nd Amendment and the Hi-Tech Weaponry of the
<br>
Future
<br>

filking pioneer Karen Anderson, Poul Anderson's wife.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ohio's oldest and largest sf/fantasy convention, Marcon annually
<br>
attracts more than 3,000 people (3,400 last year), including authors,
<br>
artists, editors, scientists, costumers, gamers and fans from more than 30

<br>

<br>
parties (including an LFS Friday night bash in a Hyatt Hotel suite); art show
<br>

<br>
Futurist Society exhibit/book-sale.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides freedom, Marcon's other 2001 program themes will be intelligence
<br>

<br>
Lockwood) and heroic fantasy (in honor of Marcon fantasy guest Robert
<br>
Jordan.)  Other featured Marcon/LFScon guests include ’ Babylon 5's actor
