<p>Lawrence Vanston Makes Some Pretty Bold
<br>
Predictions for the Future of Telecoms. He's Been
<br>
Right Before
<br>
<p>By G. CHRISTIAN HILL
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/public/current/articles/SB905789075507168500.htm">http://www.wsj.com/public/current/articles/SB905789075507168500.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p><p>Some people are born to sing, some to run; Lawrence K.
<br>
Vanston was born to predict.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Mr. Vanston, 44 years old, is
<br>
&nbsp;president of Technology Futures Inc.,
<br>
&nbsp;an Austin, Texas, consulting firm
<br>
&nbsp;that specializes in forecasting the
<br>
impact of technology change, particularly on the telephone
<br>
companies. His father, John, founded the firm in 1978 to
<br>
predict energy trends, and taught a technology forecasting
<br>
seminar at the University of Texas, where he was a professor
<br>
of nuclear engineering.
<br>
<p>While the younger Mr.
<br>
Vanston didn't exactly grow
<br>
up discussing Gompertz and
<br>
Fisher-Pry forecasting
<br>
models around the dinner
<br>
table, he did take his dad's
<br>
seminar while completing a
<br>
doctorate in operations
<br>
research, a field that involves
<br>
modeling and optimizing
<br>
business processes. After four
<br>
years at Bell Laboratories, he
<br>
decided the forecasting game
<br>
was in his blood too, and joined his father at the research
<br>
firm.
<br>
<p>&quot;I saw a need for a perspective that fit between dealing with
<br>
day-to-day problems with a short-term focus and blue-sky
<br>
speculation about the distant future,&quot; he says. &quot;This
<br>
perspective requires balancing realism and imagination.... In
<br>
other words, you have to have one foot firmly planted on the
<br>
ground and the other in the clouds. That was me, so I decided
<br>
to go for it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Vanston's work involves a lot of sophisticated statistical
<br>
modeling based on how new technologies have replaced old
<br>
ones in the past, and a canny recognition of all the variables
<br>
and assumptions that might throw the model off. But he's
<br>
careful to point out that some of his forecasts are based
<br>
partly on somewhat simplistic &quot;everything else stays the
<br>
same&quot; scenarios.
<br>
<p>For example, Mr. Vanston might look at what would happen
<br>
in the market if wireless prices plunge while assuming that
<br>
the Bells' prices and costs for providing voice service remain
<br>
the same. These simplistic analyses aren't necessarily
<br>
unrealistic, though. While they try to compete with wireless
<br>
providers, the phone companies may in fact have trouble
<br>
lowering both prices and costs while financing major
<br>
investments in new technology.
<br>
<p>Based on such assumptions, Mr. Vanston's forecasts can be
<br>
breathtaking: Local telephone carriers could lose 50% of
<br>
their calling revenue to wireless providers by 2005; unless
<br>
they co-opt wireless technology, grab much of the data
<br>
traffic and successfully enter other new businesses, their
<br>
annual cash flow will turn negative by 2010.
<br>
<p>He also foresees nearly 90% of the nation's households being
<br>
able to buy some sort of digital data pipeline -- a cable
<br>
modem, digital phone line or direct connection to a
<br>
fiber-optic network -- by 2020, and being able to download
<br>
video and other information at the amazing speed of 100
<br>
million bits a second. That's enough capacity for each home
<br>
to simultaneously receive three or four high-definition
<br>
television shows, conduct several video-telephone
<br>
conversations and still have room to download other data or
<br>
graphics at more than 10 million bits a second.
<br>
<p>But Mr. Vanston isn't regarded as some loose-tongued
<br>
dreamer. His clients include most of the Baby Bells, GTE
<br>
Corp. and Sprint Corp. They belong to a joint research
<br>
effort, the Telecommunications Technology Forecasting
<br>
Group, and have been paying for the Vanstons' research for
<br>
about a dozen years. They have used it to, among other
<br>
things, help persuade regulators to let them write off older
<br>
cable and switching equipment much more quickly, on the
<br>
theory that rapid technological changes were rendering the
<br>
assets obsolete more quickly.
<br>
<p>&quot;In categories where you can have a quantitative track
<br>
record, his record is very good,&quot; says Robert N. Welsh,
<br>
manager for capital recovery at Bell Atlantic Corp. and the
<br>
forecasting group's chairman. &quot;A classic example is the
<br>
analog switch. Larry's company forecast the demise of the
<br>
analog switch investment long before it showed up in the
<br>
[actual] data.&quot; However, Mr. Walsh warns, &quot;you have to be
<br>
careful when you look at studies in which a lot of things are
<br>
being held equal. It is a very simplistic model of a very
<br>
complex set of things.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bell Atlantic is already aggressively pursuing
<br>
countermeasures advised by Mr. Vanston, a spokesman for
<br>
the company says. It has the largest wireless operation
<br>
among the Bells and plans to deploy seven million
<br>
high-speed digital data lines to customers by the end of next
<br>
year.
<br>
<p>If anything, Mr. Vanston tries to err on the conservative
<br>
side. For example, some of his forecasts aren't adjusted to
<br>
reflect the potential &quot;multiplier&quot; effect of several
<br>
complementary technologies, such as fiber optics and
<br>
advanced digital switches, being adopted at the same time. A
<br>
forecast he made in 1995, of 48.9 million cellular-phone
<br>
users by 1997, fell short of the actual number, 55.3 million,
<br>
although it was still a lot closer to the mark than most other
<br>
predictions.
<br>
<p>Recently Mr. Vanston sat down with The Wall Street
<br>
Journal to discuss his outlook for competition in the
<br>
telecommunications industry -- in particular, whether the
<br>
Bells' lock on the &quot;last mile&quot; of connections to the nation's
<br>
households would retard market changes, or whether it
<br>
would be circumvented by new technology.
