<p>How about humans genetically modified to 10 kg?  Humans
<br>
have genetically modified poodles and chihuahuas (~4kg) from
<br>
wolves (~50 kg).  Similarly domestic cats from the wild variety.
<br>
No, forget it, unethical.  Damn.  Those born tiny would not be
<br>
volunteers.  We can use only volunteers.
<br>
<p>This is a perplexing problem.  As John Marlow pointed out,
<br>
governments wont pay for a Mars mission.  I will see his won't,
<br>
and raise him a shouldn't.  Governments *shouldnt* do this kinda
<br>
thing.  Governments should do only that which must be done,
<br>
yet cannot be done individually.  A Mars mission fails to meet
<br>
the 'must be done' criterion.
<br>
<p>So, that goes right back to private funding, which can be raised
<br>
only if there is some way to earn the money back, which leads
<br>
to tiny single astronauts because we only have funds for one
<br>
launch vehicle, outrageously high risk and attemtps to earn back
<br>
the money by selling the astronaut's email.  Most people find
<br>
one or more of these results distasteful or unacceptable.  What
<br>
am I missing in this analysis?  spike
