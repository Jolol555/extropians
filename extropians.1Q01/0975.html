Okay, call me self-aggrandizing, but this has for some
<br>
time been my take on entrusting our fates to machines:
<br>
<p>Marlow's Paradox:
<br>
<p>“We cannot entrust our fate to machines without
<br>
emotions, for they have no compassion; we cannot
<br>
entrust our fate to machines with emotions, for they
<br>
are unpredictable.” 
<br>
<p>Basically, we can't trust machines.
<br>
<p>Right now the armed parties are spread across the
<br>
globe. True, the US could hammer the rest of the world
<br>
combined--but would suffer immense damage in doing so.
<br>
<p>Handing all of the major hardware to a single, INHUMAN
<br>
party is insanity. Absolute, unmitigated lunacy.
<br>
Anything purely logical would exterminate us as
<br>
unpredictable and dangerous. Anything emotional is
<br>
itself unpredictable and dangerous.
<br>
<p>To top it off, no nation is going to willingly fund
<br>
and imlement an impartial, all-powerful AI. Any nation
<br>
funding or implementing such a thing will make damned
<br>
sure it IS partial--to them. And probably that it has
<br>
backdoors as well.
