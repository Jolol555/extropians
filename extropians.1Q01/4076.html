</em><br>
<p>yes, that is what i intend.  however, there were no entries for it in
<br>
WORLDCAT, MEDLINE, and there were only two hits on the internet for
<br>
&quot;orthogony&quot; and one was talking about religion and i cannot remember
<br>
what the other was talking of (i think religion).  orthogon hit for
<br>
hacking.  the crystal engineer, computer scientist, and architect all
<br>
disagreed with me and said i was mutilating way too much and that
<br>
words mysteriously come from Europe only.  however, i think the
<br>
concept is highly applicable and there is no need to say
<br>
&quot;orthogonality&quot;.  for instance this + would be an orthogon.  and
<br>
perhaps the more abstract concepts, or theoretical biological objects
<br>
(or CS obj's) can be in orthogony, or orthogonic.  the main thought
<br>
that i have is that &quot;something is exhibiting orthogony&quot;.
