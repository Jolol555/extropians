<p>By BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse 
<br>
Mankind will soon have the ability to move the Earth into a new orbit, say a 
<br>
team of astronomers. The planetary manoeuvre may more than double the time 
<br>
life can survive on our planet, they believe. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Our initial analysis shows that the general problem of long-term planetary 
<br>
engineering is almost alarmingly feasible
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Korycansky and colleagues  
<br>
Our Sun will increase its brightness in the next billion years or so, and if 
<br>
the Earth stays in its present orbit it will be fried and all life 
<br>
eliminated. 
<br>
<p>Using the well-understood &quot;gravitational sling shot&quot; technique that has been 
<br>
employed to send space probes to the outer planets, the researchers now think 
<br>
a large asteroid could be used to reposition the Earth to maintain a benign 
<br>
global climate. 
<br>
<p>It is an &quot;alarmingly simple&quot; technique, the astronomers say. It could ensure 
<br>
humanity's survival and even allow our descendants to alter our Solar System 
<br>
to move moons and planets to make new Earths. 
<br>
<p>The astonishing idea has been put forward by Don Korycansky, of the 
<br>
University of California, along with Gregory Laughlin, of the US space Agency 
<br>
Nasa, and Fred Adams, of the University of Michigan. 
<br>
<p>End of life 
<br>
<p>Astronomers believe that in a billion years from now our Sun will be over 10% 
<br>
brighter than it is today. Global climate models indicate that the Earth will 
<br>
react to this increase by at first becoming a &quot;moist greenhouse&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Looking even further ahead, the Sun will increase its luminosity by about 40% 
<br>
in three billion years. This will force the Earth into a &quot;runaway greenhouse&quot; 
<br>
state, such as exists currently on the planet Venus. 
<br>
<p>According to the authors of a new study, this will &quot;spell a definite end to 
<br>
life on our planet&quot;. But there is a way to counter the increasing brightness 
<br>
of the Sun, the scientists say - just increase the radius of the Earth's 
<br>
orbit! 
<br>
<p>&quot;Our initial analysis shows that the general problem of long-term planetary 
<br>
engineering is almost alarmingly feasible,&quot; they say. 
<br>
<p>All that is required is for a large asteroid, about 100 km (62 miles) across, 
<br>
to fly past the Earth transferring some of its orbital energy to our planet. 
<br>
The asteroid would then move out to encounter Jupiter where it would acquire 
<br>
more energy that it could impart to the Earth on a subsequent encounter. 
<br>
<p>Favourable position 
<br>
<p>To expand the Earth's orbit around the Sun at a rate that compensates for the 
<br>
increasing brightness of the star would require an encounter every 6,000 
<br>
years, or about every 240 generations. 
<br>
<p>Earth's gradual outward migration may require adjustments to be made to the 
<br>
orbits of other planets as well. Recent calculations of the Solar System's 
<br>
stability indicate that if the Earth was removed then Venus and Mercury would 
<br>
become destabilised in a relatively short time. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps, the authors suggest, many moons and planets could be moved into more 
<br>
favourable positions in the Solar System where their climates might support 
<br>
life. 
<br>
<p>In the past, some astronomers have suggested that Mars could be terraformed 
<br>
to make it more like the Earth. The Earth-orbital-migration technique, say 
<br>
the researchers, is a far easier way to provide living space for humans in a 
<br>
changing Solar System. 
<br>
<p>But it would be a procedure that required some care. If the 100 km asteroid 
<br>
was to collide with the Earth then it would wipe out all life on our planet. 
<br>
&quot;This danger cannot be overemphasised,&quot; the researchers stress. 
<br>
<p>But &quot;as a way of preserving the entire biosphere of the Earth, this method is 
<br>
promising and efficient,&quot; they say.
