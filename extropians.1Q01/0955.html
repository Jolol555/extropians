The Project is looking for a small amount of funding to enable it to
<br>
continue until at least March 31, 2001, by which time Dr Pichugin
<br>
expects to have a visa which will enable him to leave the project to
<br>
pursue research elsewhere.
<br>
<p>Those wishing to support this endeavor with a donation which might be
<br>
used for US federal and California state tax relief (possibly still
<br>
for the year 2000, if done quickly) may do so by sending a monetary
<br>
instrument to:
<br>
<p>The Institute for Neural Cryobiology
<br>
238 Davenport Rd, #240
<br>
Toronto, ON M5R 1J6
<br>
Canada
<br>
<p>Thank you for your attention,

<p>HSCP Progress Report and Plans
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time of the Asilomar meeting, the HSCP had
<br>
managed to achieve a more than 10 times improvement in the
<br>
state of the art of cryopreservation of large, integrated
<br>
neural systems, the cryopreservation of which had not
<br>
previously been reported in the formal scientific literature
<br>
to our knowledge.  Hippocampal brain slices frozen in a
<br>
variety of ways using the standard glycerol originally found
<br>
by Suda to be optimal for cryopreservation of brains were
<br>
found to yield only about 5% plus or minus 5% viability after
<br>
thawing from dry ice temperature.  Hippocampal slices
<br>
vitrified with the simplest and most elementary exemplar 
<br>
of the new 21CM vitrification solutions (essentially Veg) 
<br>
recovered with 53% of the potassium and sodium transport
<br>
capacity of fresh, untreated slices.  This accomplishment
<br>
greatly understates the magnitude of the advance over the
<br>
prior state of the art in that it is safe to assume that frozen-
<br>
thawed slices sustain major structural damage as a result of
<br>
the formation and dissolution of ice, whereas such damage
<br>
is presumably absent after vitrification and warming. Therefore,
<br>
the new methods are believed to achieve both immensely
<br>
greater functional recovery and immensely greater structural
<br>
preservation than has been possible with more conventional
<br>
techniques.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Asilomar meeting, an attempt has been made to
<br>
further improve upon these results.  The bottom line is that,
<br>
at the time of this report (January 9, 2001), the viability of
<br>
vitrified/rewarmed rat hippocampal brain slices has been
<br>
increased to about 66%.  Progress was slower than hoped for
<br>
because the thrust of the experiments was to exploit more
<br>
sophisticated vitrification solutions, and this required a 
<br>
re-optimization of the method for adding and removing the
<br>
cryoprotectant.  The damage sustained by the slices is very
<br>
sensitive to factors such as osmotic stress, temperature, and
<br>
time, and the previous method of addition and washout was no
<br>
longer the best.  Also, due to the presence of non-penetrating
<br>
cryoprotectants that require time to diffuse into the slices,
<br>
we found that it was necessary to expose the slices to the
<br>
highest concentrations of cryoprotectant for longer times in
<br>
order to allow vitrification to occur.
<br>
When the previous equilibration time of 10 min was used, slices
<br>
that were cooled to below -130oC and rewarmed gave variable and
<br>
usually suboptimal results, but when equilibration time was
<br>
extended to 20 min, then vitrification yielded the 66% recovery
<br>
just noted.  It is possible this can be improved slightly by
<br>
even longer exposure to the cryoprotectant prior to
<br>
vitrification, or by modifications of the solution that will
<br>
allow for faster equilibration. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, 66% recovery of brain slice function is 
<br>
equivalent to the recovery of K/Na ratio typically achieved for
<br>
vitrified/rewarmed rabbit kidney slices by 21CM, a remarkable
<br>
coincidence.  There is indirect evidence that this may be
<br>
sufficient for long term cellular survival after transplantation
<br>
and in vivo recovery.  We attempted to improve the K/Na ratio of
<br>
rat hippocampal slices by culturing them for longer times after
<br>
exposure to cryoprotectant to see if self-repair would be
<br>
apparent, but at incubation times at least as long as 8 hours,
<br>
there was no apparent improvement.  On the other hand, we believe
<br>
that 66% recovery implies 66% recovery of the function of each 
<br>
individual cell, rather than outright loss of 34% of the cells
<br>
with full recovery of the remaining 66%.  Several brain slices
<br>
have been fixed using an electron microscopy grade fixative and
<br>
will be examined structurally to verify general integrity of all
<br>
cells and the preservation of brain slice structure after
<br>
vitrification and rewarming.  Unfortunately, as of the time of
<br>
this writing, the samples have not yet been processed and the
<br>
structural results are not available.  If the project continues,
<br>
this gap will be closed by processing these samples as well as
<br>
additional samples that will further probe the issue of
<br>
structural preservation after vitrification.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, we plan to use a vitrification solution that
<br>
we believe is an improvement over the one adopted following the
<br>
Asilomar meeting.  In February, we expect to have a further
<br>
improvement ready for trial on brain slices.  The 3rd
<br>
vitrification solution has already been shipped to Dr. Pichugin
<br>
and has been received, along with more of the 2nd solution for
<br>
direct head-to-head comparison.  At present, we have no reason
<br>
to believe that we cannot exceed the 66% functional recovery
<br>
level achieved so far.
