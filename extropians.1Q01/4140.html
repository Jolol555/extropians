<p>Guiding Science
<br>
Technologist Bill Joy leads a debate over how far we should go with new
<br>
machines
<br>
BY RICHARD SCHEININ
<br>
Mercury News
<br>
<p>Bill Joy is once more trumpeting the dangers of technology run amok.
<br>
Speaking in San Francisco this week, there was a moment when the co-inventor
<br>
of Java brought home the deep impact of his argument: Perhaps science should
<br>
stop manipulating genes, he suggested, even if new gene therapies might save
<br>
a child from incurable cancer.
<br>
<p>``No, we don't have to fix it,'' said Joy, the co-founder and chief
<br>
scientist of Sun Microsystems, if the cost to society is dire.
<br>
<p>He's said it before, he continued, and ``people have left the room'' over
<br>
his suggestion ``that I could imagine letting someone suffer to protect the
<br>
group.''
<br>
<p>There it was: Joy had called for a new ethical consideration of research
<br>
into new technologies that, he contends, could lead to the extinction of the
<br>
human species in the 21st century. The panel of experts who responded to
<br>
Joy -- a geneticist, a robotics researcher, a biochemist, a philosopher, an
<br>
ethicist -- didn't necessarily buy his arguments. Yet Joy had put one of the
<br>
great questions of the age right out there in the open: In the face of
<br>
technologies that might kill us, are we willing to curtail the rights of the
<br>
individual to protect society?
<br>
<p>The Wednesday night forum at Grace Cathedral was called to consider how the
<br>
swiftly emerging fields of genomics, robotics and nanotechnology might
<br>
converge and affect humanity's future. Now there is a broad discussion on
<br>
this subject, a dialogue across the boundaries of science and religion.
<br>
Wednesday's event was a sign of this faith-science convergence: Its sponsors
<br>
included the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Program
<br>
of Dialogue on Science, Ethics and Religion; the Center for Theology and the
<br>
Natural Sciences in Berkeley; the Episcopal Working Group on Science,
<br>
Technology and Faith; Grace Cathedral; and the Episcopal Diocese of
<br>
California.
<br>
<p>The jump-off point for the forum was a long, widely discussed and decidedly
<br>
apocalyptic article that Joy wrote in the April 2000 issue of Wired magazine
<br>
called ``Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.'' (It's available at
<br>
www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html)
<br>
<p>In a nutshell, Joy forecast doom: ``I think it is no exaggeration to say we
<br>
are on the cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil,'' he wrote, ``an
<br>
evil whose possibility spreads well beyond that which weapons of mass
<br>
destruction bequeathed to nation-states, on to a surprising and terrible
<br>
empowerment of extreme individuals.''
<br>
<p>Joy began his talk Wednesday by reviewing portions of what he wrote: He
<br>
believes that commercial forces -- consumed by profit, unconcerned with
<br>
risk -- are propelling us toward calamity. By 2030, he says, computers will
<br>
be a million times more powerful than they are now and there will be no time
<br>
left to curb their impact:
<br>
<p><p>a..  Biotechnology will allow for routine cut-and-pasting of genetic
<br>
material -- and the creation, by accident or intent, of virulent pathogens
<br>
that could decimate whole societies.
<br>
<p>b..  Self-replicating, intelligent robots will emerge in the laboratory,
<br>
then merge with people, then, conceivably, subjugate and even replace the
<br>
human species.
<br>
<p>c..  Nanotechnology, through which scientists attempt to build machines the
<br>
size of molecules, may lead to enormous benefits. For instance,
<br>
micro-machines with the intelligence of supercomputers might conduct
<br>
search-and-destroy missions against cancer cells inside the body. But the
<br>
technology might also give rise to self-replicating micro-robots, or
<br>
``nanobots,'' created in the laboratory to, say, kill weeds. There's always
<br>
the chance, though, that the micro-robots will instead mutate, escape and
<br>
proliferate like mad, eradicating all plant life on the planet.
<br>
<p>Turning on technology
<br>
<p>There was more than a little irony in hearing Joy, a celebrated creator of
<br>
technology, turning on it.
<br>
<p>``Come on, Bill!'' exclaimed panelist Manuela Veloso, a leading builder of
<br>
robots and professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute.
<br>
``You shut Sun and I will close my laboratory,'' she challenged him, adding
<br>
that advances in robotics could not happen without ``extremely fast and
<br>
beautiful computers. Who made them? You did. Not me.''
<br>
<p>Certainly, humanity has lived with the specter of technological destruction
<br>
for some time. Since July 16, 1945, when the first atomic test was conducted
<br>
in the New Mexico desert, a fiery sword of Damocles has hung over humanity's
<br>
head. Eyewitnesses were so filled with awe that they resorted to religious
<br>
imagery to describe the spectacle: ``I am become death, the destroyer of
<br>
worlds,'' physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the bomb, quoted
<br>
from the Bhagavad-Gita.
<br>
<p>Yet governments have thus far succeeded in stepping away from the nuclear
<br>
abyss. And despite the much-talked-about threat of bio-terrorism, it hasn't
<br>
happened, argued Ken Culver, executive director of the department of
<br>
pharmacogenetics for the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. in New Jersey.
<br>
<p>``What's most important?'' asked Culver, another panelist, who says
<br>
experimental gene therapies are already demonstrating curative powers.
<br>
``Each of us has people in our families who encounter the health-care system
<br>
only to be told there's nothing that can be done to help loved ones who are
<br>
sick. Do we really want to relinquish our understanding of the human
<br>
genome'' -- the newly discovered sequence in which human genes are strung
<br>
together -- ``because of speculative theory . . . that sinister behavior
<br>
will occur?''
<br>
<p>James Heath, a biochemist and nanotechnology researcher at the University of
<br>
California-Los Angeles, told Joy that ``nanobots'' are ``science fiction.''
<br>
Workaday scientists in his field are trying to create incredibly
<br>
energy-efficient micro-machines to alleviate the developing world's energy
<br>
shortage -- and California's, too.
<br>
<p>More than once, Veloso scolded Joy: ``The future is not so dark.''
<br>
<p>But Joy, rail-skinny, a little disheveled and still looking like the
<br>
Berkeley graduate student he once was, said that, if anything, it's getting
<br>
darker.
<br>
<p><p>Seeing bleak
<br>
<p>In the past year, it was reported that Russian scientists in 1990 combined
<br>
anthrax with a soil bacterium to make a new anthrax resistant to vaccines.
<br>
Last month, Australian scientists announced that, while trying to engineer a
<br>
contraceptive vaccine for laboratory mice, they accidentally created a
<br>
disease that killed the mice.
<br>
<p>That scientists might accidentally kill people, or that deranged people
<br>
might set out to do just that, is not science fiction, Joy told the audience
<br>
of 200 who filled most of the assembly hall in the cathedral's basement.
<br>
<p>So what exactly is coming out of all this besides argument and depression?
<br>
<p>A surprising lot.
<br>
<p>In an interview before the forum, Joy noted that the emerging wave of
<br>
technologies is forcing discussion of fundamental questions. What's the
<br>
right way to live? What does it mean to be in the world? What is the value
<br>
and danger of knowledge? What are our highest values?
<br>
<p>He doesn't describe himself as a religious person. But more and more, he
<br>
finds himself thrust into religious communities. Last year, while camping in
<br>
the desert, a friend offered to introduce him to Rabbi Zalman
<br>
Schachter-Shalomi, a leader in what's known as the ``Jewish Renewal''
<br>
movement who lives, like Joy, in Colorado.
<br>
<p>``Zalman said, `Maybe we should declare that nanotechnology isn't kosher,
<br>
and maybe the pope should declare it a mortal sin,''' Joy said. ``I said,
<br>
`That's an interesting perspective. Most of the people in my company don't
<br>
think like that.'
<br>
<p>``I'm not trying to be apocalyptic. I'm just observing facts,'' he
<br>
continued. ``You can be in denial or you can talk about it. Or you can look
<br>
at it sort of mystically and say, `It'll all work out OK. Just have faith.'
<br>
But religion doesn't say that, does it? Religion says if it doesn't work
<br>
out, the big flood is going to come and we'll have to start all over
<br>
again.''
<br>
<p>Wednesday night, he told the audience that he wants to be an optimist. He
<br>
floated some ideas for reducing the risk of technological calamity:
<br>
Establish a Hippocratic oath of responsibility for scientists; ``monetize''
<br>
risk, by factoring it into corporate spreadsheets as a hedge against
<br>
recklessness in technological development; and, most controversially, set
<br>
limits on free speech to stop the spread of dangerous technological
<br>
knowledge. Not all information, not all computer coding, should be shared
<br>
with just anyone anymore, he said.
<br>
<p>This last suggestion has caused critics to describe Joy as an enemy of the
<br>
democratic, open society. His response: ``What are we getting from society
<br>
if we can't protect it from these kooks?''
<br>
<p>No one engaged Joy on the free-speech issue.
<br>
<p>But some of his warnings were being heard.
<br>
<p>Philip Clayton, who chairs the Sonoma State University philosophy
<br>
department, compared advancing technology to a ``supertanker'' that can be
<br>
slowly steered but not stopped. ``What if the Brave New World has already
<br>
arrived?'' he asked.
<br>
<p>Clayton asked the other panelists not to dismiss Joy's predictions out of
<br>
hand. Joy had mentioned an apocryphal story of Native American elders who
<br>
never make a tribal decision until they consider its impact on the next
<br>
seven generations.
<br>
<p>``Do we vote for the good of the seventh generation?'' Clayton asked. ``Or
<br>
do we generally vote for what we take to be our personal good? How
<br>
enlightened are we?''
<br>
<p>At this moment, not very. Yet the ``multi-generational impact'' of
<br>
technology must be assessed, said ethicist Audrey Chapman, who heads the
<br>
Dialogue on Science, Ethics and Religion of the American Association for the
<br>
Advancement of Science. The largest association of scientists in the
<br>
country, it is holding its annual conference in San Francisco this weekend.
<br>
<p>``We live in a permissive society . . .'' Chapman said. ``There's this idea
<br>
that individuals should have the right to adopt and use any technologies
<br>
that they consider advantageous.''
<br>
<p><p>Debating rights
<br>
<p>As the evening wound down, conversation was returning to individual rights
<br>
vs. collective rights.
<br>
<p>The matter of the hypothetical child, sick with cancer, returned.
<br>
<p>Joy repeated that he might abstain from seeking new treatments if it
<br>
involved risky genetic research.
<br>
<p>``Bill, you are afflicted with fixing all the bugs in your software,'' said
<br>
Veloso, the robotics researcher. ``But you don't want other scientists to be
<br>
afflicted with fixing people.''
<br>
<p>Culver, the geneticist, was perturbed by Joy's position: ``It isn't about
<br>
individual health,'' he told Joy. ``It's about all our health, which
<br>
includes individuals.''
<br>
<p>Joy considered that statement for a moment. Then he said that not knowing
<br>
everything there is to know ``may have group benefit as well.''
