<p>If Bill Joy's concerns are justified (i.e. not in the dino-killer

asteroid strike to Tunguska Event range of probability) then I would

advocate that nano should only be tested OFF earth. On that basis,

colonizing the moon and mars in order to build nanotech development

infrastructure is of paramount importance and totally justifies the
<br>
investment. The potential benefits of nanotech are too great to not
<br>
develop it.
