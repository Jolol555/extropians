</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does this belief effect the way you live your life?
</em><br>
<p>My initial response would be that it doesn't.
<br>
<p>But in truth, that may not be entirely correct. Let me think about it...
<br>
<p>I spent decades literally fighting against everything I perceived people
<br>
were trying to force upon me. This caused me to think of the &quot;society&quot;, of
<br>
the &quot;masses&quot;, as a horde of sheep; I perceived the government as a bunch of
<br>
robbers who are trying to steal things away from me; and I really couldn't
<br>
identify with anyone who claimed that 'society' is a good thing, and that
<br>
paying one's 'debt' towards the 'society' is good. Because, I thought, there
<br>
is no such thing as a 'society' - there's just a bunch of morons who want to
<br>
control me. [This paragraph is slightly exaggerated for purposes of
<br>
illustration.]
<br>
<p>Then, one day, I found that, without this horrible society that I live in, I
<br>
wouldn't have had nothing that I like and love. I would have no internet
<br>
connection. I would have no computer. I would have no car. I would have no
<br>
refrigerator. I would have no toothbrush. I wouldn't have the clothes that I
<br>
have. All of this is made possible because of Law And Order (TM), and
<br>
law+order come at a price. I suddenly realized society is a good thing.
<br>
<p>I then suddenly realized that I am a contributor in this society, as are
<br>
lots of other people. I realized we can do things together that we couldn't
<br>
have done alone. That law and order are good, and that even taxes as a
<br>
principle are good, despite the morons that run the whole show.
<br>
Instinctively, I started perceiving the whole system as a Living Thing that
<br>
works much like a human organism, and in which I have a place.
<br>
<p>In time, I might even become a sociable human being. ;-)
<br>
<p>Hm. But all of this is just about my perception of society as &quot;a good thing&quot;
<br>
versus &quot;a bad thing&quot;. It really has nothing to do with whether I perceive
<br>
the society to be &quot;alive&quot; or not.
<br>
<p>So I guess the answer to your question is the same as my original response.
<br>
My comparing the society to a living thing does not really have an influence
<br>
on my life. It doesn't really matter. I'm just annoyed by people who insist
<br>
on rejecting different views because they are, well, incompatible with their
<br>
preferred mode of thinking.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; What things would you do differently if you didn't believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society is a living entity?
</em><br>
<p>I probably wouldn't do anything differently.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; This is not meant to be a rhetorical question. I'd really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to know the answer.
</em><br>
<p>Appreciated.
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
<p>denis
