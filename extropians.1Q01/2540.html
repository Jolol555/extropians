<p>Time for real intelligence?
By BBC News Online's Ivan Noble
<p>It is time to start building machines which can learn and be raised in the
same way as humans, the authors of an article in the journal Science say.
<p>Building an intelligent machine is no small feat and so previous efforts
have centred on designing a machine to carry out specific tasks.
<p>But computer scientist Professor Juyang Weng of Michigan State University
says it is time to work on systems which &quot;live&quot; autonomously, have bodies
suited to their working environment and learn in a general sense.
<p>&quot;According to this paradigm, robots should be designed to go through a long
period of autonomous mental development, from 'infancy' to 'adulthood'.&quot;
&quot;The essence of mental development is to enable robots to autonomously
'live' in the world and to become smart on their own, with some supervision
by humans,&quot; he writes.
<p>Underlying principles
<p>Making computers copy the way humans learn should not be as difficult as it
sounds if scientists can uncover the underlying principles of mental
development.
<p>Experiments using animals have shown that similar processes are at work for
different senses, such as sight and hearing.
<p>A living brain does not take in every single aspect of an image it is
seeing, but makes general observations about shape, colour and motion.
<p>Developmental robots will learn to perform dull and repetitive tasks that
humans do not like to do
Professor Juyang Weng
<p>Experimenting with robots will also improve the chances of answering
questions such as how the human brain develops a sense of the world
around it, Professor Weng says.
<p>And developmental robots will learn to do jobs which humans shun, such as
working underwater and in space, or cleaning up nuclear waste, he says.
<p>Prototype
<p>Professor Weng and his colleagues have already built a prototype
developmental robot, called SAIL.
<p>SAIL is allowed to explore the real world for itself, but a supervising
human shows it toys and reinforces behaviour patterns by pressing a &quot;good&quot;
button and a &quot;bad&quot; button.
<p>More money needs to be spent on understanding the way humans and animals
learn, he says:
<p>&quot;Biologically motivated mental development methods for robots and
computational modelling of animal mental development should be especially
encouraged.&quot;
