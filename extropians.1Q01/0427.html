<p><em>&gt;It should also be noted that a good (but not great) movie about Onegin came
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out a year or so ago, with typically splendid acting from Ralph Fiennes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(perhaps my favorite actor).
</em><br>
<p>Drat, missed it. I like Fiennes too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Though I have not read it yet (it is on my &quot;to-read&quot; bookshelf...),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hofstadter's _Le Ton Beau de Marot_ is about interpretation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translation, revolving primarily around little-known French poet Clement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Marot.
</em><br>
<p>OK, I'm convinced. Now this is a future book for me to read.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just look at the Bible.  The amount of interpretations and translations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which have been derived from that book boggle the mind.
</em><br>
<p>Silly me,
<br>
<p>Somehow I forgot this interpreted work. Probably the largest and
<br>
longest-running interpreted work ever. We should add the Koran too.
<br>
<p>Did anyone else ever read _Good News for Modern Man_ (I think that's
<br>
the title), a strange translation of the Bible's New Testament, where
<br>
the words are rewritten in &quot;today's&quot; language? It's wierd. I think I
<br>
prefer Jesus Christ Superstar (or Life of Brian)  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Music is perhaps the only art in which emulation/interpretation can be as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creative as new compositions.  Though I generally prefer newer music on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avant-garde, I have heard some wonderful renditions of old classics which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are both creative and still retain the essence of the original (a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example of this is George Winston's 5 &amp; 1/2 minute rendition of Pachabel's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Canon in D).
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p>I read somewhere that Nigel Kennedy's Vivaldi: Four Seasons was on
<br>
Britain's  Top-40 POP MUSIC list (~10 years ago). Definitely not traditional.
<br>
<p>Alot of years ago, when I was younger and generally more stupid about
<br>
symphonic music, I had a conversation with my Estonian cousin-in-law,
<br>
who is a professional music conductor and violinist, about some music
<br>
cassette tapes that I had with me of some classical music. I didn't write
<br>
on the cassette box the name of the orchestra or the conductor,
<br>
because I honestly didn't think that it made much difference. &quot;You
<br>
*don't know* and *it doesn't matter*?!&quot; he asks. &quot;No...&quot;, Amara says
<br>
sheepishly. (A composer's piece sounds basically the same, no matter
<br>
what orchestra plays it and no matter what conductor interprets it,
<br>
right? )  How embarrassing.
<br>
<p>Needless to say, he straightened me out on that (our first) meeting
<br>
about the huge difference the conductor and orchestra make in interpreting
<br>
classical music.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is interesting that the sonnet form caught on so quickly after Thomas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wyatt brought it back from Italy (originally devised by an Italian named
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Petrarch). Wyatt's most famous poem is both a combination of translation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(most of it), as well as a mirror of his own situation (it refers to his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mistress, Anne Boelin):
</em><br>
<p>In _Handbook to Literature_ by C. Holman, the author says that Wyatt
<br>
translated Petrarchan (14th century) Italian sonnets and then left over 30
<br>
sonnets of his own composition in English. An associate of Wyatt,
<br>
named Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (1517-1547) shares the credit with
<br>
Wyatt for introducing the Italian sonnet form to England.
<br>
<p>(who says my high school literature class was not useful?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Wyatt's most famous poem is both a combination of translation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(most of it), as well as a mirror of his own situation
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the poetry. It's fun to weave oneself into one's own public
<br>
writings,
<br>
especially in extremely subtle ways, which no one else would understand.
<br>
(private jokes)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is interesting to note that the English language is (in the early 16th
</em><br>
<em>&gt;century) quite legible and understandable by today's standards, yet when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one reads Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_ from ~130 years earlier, its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;language is quite hard to understand.
</em><br>
<p>You too?  I had a conference in Canterbury last April, and I bought
<br>
Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_ as a souvenir. The book is too
<br>
tedious to read, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There's no question that Hofstadter would be the best kind of person to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translations.  If only he would take a stab at Dostoyevsky...
</em><br>
<p>Dostoevsky's _The Idiot_ has been my airplane and holiday reading
<br>
material during the last 2 weeks. The main character, Prince Myshkin,
<br>
acts in the Russian tradition of the Holy Fool. What a character!
<br>
The novel is entertaining and an interesting perspective of upper class
<br>
19th century Russian life. I'm sure I'm missing important aspects in the
<br>
English translation, though, and interestingly enough, the
<br>
translator's name is not listed anywhere in the paperback book.
