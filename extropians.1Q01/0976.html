Additional thought:
<br>
<p>You are right that &quot;who do you trust?&quot; becomes ever more important as
<br>
power concentrates. As I never tire of repeating, even something as
<br>
rudimentary as Axelrod's _The Evolution of Cooperation_
<br>
(<a href="http://pscs.physics.lsa.umich.edu/Software/CC/ECHome.html">http://pscs.physics.lsa.umich.edu/Software/CC/ECHome.html</a> if you're
<br>
lazy) points out that rough parity between players is essential for
<br>
cooperation to be a successful, evolutionarily stable strategy.
