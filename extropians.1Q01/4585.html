<p><em>&gt;&gt; I tend to look down on political theory ... and prefer to judge issues on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a case-by-case, situationalist (posthuman aesthetic) way.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't look down on political philosophy, though I look down on certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong political philosophies.
</em><br>
<p>No political theory is completely correct ... and all are formed out
<br>
of past events so might not be relevant in the future. If a theory cannot
<br>
be continually modified ... then it is dead meat. And if it is continually
<br>
modified, then it cannot ever be formulated ......  so why bother?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By what means does one &quot;to judge issues on a case-by-case, situationalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(posthuman aesthetic) way?&quot;  That would seem to mean to me an implicit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tacit political philosophy as opposed to an explicit one.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The latter is easier to examine.
</em><br>
<p>Fossils are easy to examine, this is true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(Also, I think such &quot;case-by-case&quot; thinking is just how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the average person and politician approaches matters.
</em><br>
<p>Of course it must be ..... politicians in practice find they cannot
<br>
stick to their cumbersome political theories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is how we get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people who say they are for freedom of expression, but against expression
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they or well established find offensive, such as people who against anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making anti-Christian art.)
</em><br>
<p>Not sure what you mean here, but certainly, a priori offence at
<br>
anti-Christian
<br>
art is a 'political' theory rather than a case-by-case aesthetic judgement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think also there is a difference between having a rule in this area and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having principles.  The latter are contextual and open-ended, the former
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt;neither.  Most people I know don't think of the latter as an alternative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the former.  They are suspicious of any systematic thinking.  I'm not.:)
</em><br>
<p>Principles or guide-lines are &quot;soft rules&quot; as opposed to &quot;hard rules&quot;, sure.
<br>
I have deliberately never tried to compile any &quot;Posthuman Principles&quot;
<br>
though because I *do* distrust (or rather, see little point in) UNIVERSAL
<br>
catch-all linguistic formulations that are independent of any empirical test
<br>
or evidence. I suppose it is inevitable that we make up Posthuman
<br>
*suggestions* from time to time, but maybe shouldn't try to pretend that
<br>
such suggestions are immune from change and somehow true for all
<br>
time or permanent .. that would be self-defeating for a radical futurist
<br>
agenda! And if the extropian principles are updated every year, then
<br>
they cannot be very principled principles anyway ... far too short term ..
