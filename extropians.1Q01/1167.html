<p>
I have had reason recently to consider a species of hyperfocus that can
<br>
set in. Sometimes, fueled by habit or high emotions, people get wound up
<br>
in talking about &quot;the problem&quot;. This can quickly become The Problem or
<br>
even THE PROBLEM. Tunnel vision naturally ensues. Severe tunnel vision
<br>
has costs, including alienation and behavior that might seem extreme.
<br>
<p>I have had a chapter title in the back of my mind for some time now:
<br>
&quot;The problem is 'The Problem Is...'&quot;
<br>
<p>Has anyone got constructive comments on how to productively deal with
<br>
this sort of thing? I've written a bunch of stuff elsewhere on flaming
<br>
causes and cures. I'll post a URL if it's worth bothering.
<br>
<p>We can save &quot;All &lt;x&gt; do &lt;y&gt;, so all who do &lt;y&gt; must be &lt;x&gt;&quot; for another
<br>
time...
