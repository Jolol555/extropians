Brian Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:brian@posthuman.com?Subject=Re:%20More%20important%2012th%20question?%20(was%20Re:%2011%20questions%20about%20the%20Universe)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101220550.WAA11710@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">brian@posthuman.com</a>&gt; asked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And Brent what if science goes on for another 50 years with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovery of this? At what point would you accept that it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist? It seems kinda like the problem with never being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove God doesn't exist.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, great question!  But it depends on which particular theory
<br>
turns out to be true in place of this one.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Moravek's idea of opening up the skull and layer by layer
<br>
replacing each neuron with a purely causally simulated version running
<br>
on hardware very different than the brain.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we get to the primary visual cortex, lets start by just
<br>
replacing one point in the field of vision and simulating it.
<br>
According to this theory, the person could still behave in some
<br>
similar ways, perhaps like a person with &quot;blind sight&quot;.  But the new
<br>
simulated spot in his visual cortex would no longer be phenomenally
<br>
present in his field of vision.  It would be a blind spot, just as
<br>
subjectively blind in that spot as if the person had lost that spot of
<br>
his visual cortex due to some kind of trauma.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the subjective experience wasn't copying the same to the
<br>
drastically different computational machinery, they would stop and try
<br>
to figure out what and why such wasn't moving across.  Why doesn't the
<br>
new causal virtual neuron have the same subjective &quot;pheomenal
<br>
qualiteies&quot; would be the question.  Surely qualia will be discovered
<br>
long before we attempt anything like this, for mainly the same
<br>
reasons.  But if they are able to do it just as Hans says, completely
<br>
copying or uploading a person into some radically different, purely
<br>
causal software machine.  If such an uploaded person says, this salty
<br>
sensation I'm experiencing after this upload is the same as it was
<br>
when I was in my meat body, and no one, including the subject, notices
<br>
any difference regardless of what hardware his new &quot;virtual&quot; simulated
<br>
self is running on.  Then of course this qualia theory will have been
<br>
completely proved wrong.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course, when my brain dies, if my spirit is really
<br>
freed from my dieing brain going of to heaven or hell... then of
<br>
course I will know that that particular theory was correct instead of
<br>
this qualia one...  ;)  How many other theories are there?
