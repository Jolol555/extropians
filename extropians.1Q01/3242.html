<p>Perhaps you are not reading carefully. I said &quot;once you are under
<br>
arrest&quot;. Arrest is not detainment, and it's not conversation.
<br>
<p>&quot;Rights&quot;? It's more proper to speak of police _powers_. 
<br>
<p>I agree that an individual policeman has the same rights as I have. Im
<br>
the jurisdictions I keep tabs on, however, their powers to arrest are
<br>
significantly stronger. And, once one is arrested, they can legitimately
<br>
search one's person. 
<br>
<p>Exactly what that means might vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction;
<br>
but I do know that they don't need a warrant to put everything one has
<br>
with one into a bag _once one is under arrest_. That comes with the
<br>
booking, usually.
