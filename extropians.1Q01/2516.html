<p>This sort of assertion is not worthy of your intelligence, Mike. 
<br>
<p>That's the only conceivable reason for opposing fast breeder reactors, eh?
<br>
<p>Let's see:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.ieer.org/reports/npdd.html">http://www.ieer.org/reports/npdd.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt; Reactors designed specifically to produce more fissile material than they
<br>
consume as a result of the conversion of uranium-238 into fissile plutonium
<br>
isotopes are called &quot;breeder reactors.&quot;&gt;
<br>
<p>Hey! That's a great idea! Let's breed lots and lots of fissile plutonium
<br>
isotopes! We could set up another plant down the road to pump out
<br>
industrial quantities of Sarin gas while we're at it, but we'd make sure to
<br>
keep it in very safe bottles.
<br>
<p>Oh, by the way, the same report claims:
<br>
<p>&lt; Despite its theoretical attractiveness in converting non-fissile into
<br>
fissile material, the breeder reactor has turned out to be a far tougher
<br>
technology than thermal reactors. Despite five decades of effort during
<br>
which many pilot and &quot;demonstration&quot; plants have been built, the
<br>
sodium-cooled breeder reactor design remains on the margin of commercial
<br>
nuclear technology. The magic of fuel multiplication has not yet been
<br>
realized on any meaningful scale relative to nuclear electricity generation
<br>
levels. &gt;
<br>
<p>Is that to be believed? After all, the Institute for Energy and
<br>
Environmental Research is almost certainly a bunch of pinko self-serving
<br>
sky-are-fallers. And it might be that the reason breeders are not yet
<br>
financially plausible is precisely because ninny bureaucracies have
<br>
mandated orders of magnitude more safety provisions over their deployment
<br>
than is warranted. I can accept that. I mean, this is just nice, clean
<br>
*plutonium* we're talking about making here, right, all around the world?
