<p>I'm not attempting to derive natural rights -- I'm demonstrating that
<br>
there's no such thing as natural rights derived from human nature, and 
<br>
that it's much more useful to view rights as constructions emerging
<br>
from social interaction.
<br>
<p>I'm also deliberately not making any assumptions about &quot;human nature&quot; 
<br>
(which underpins natural rights theory) because this is the EXTROPIANS
<br>
LIST, where concepts such as alien intelligences, AI's, uplifted
<br>
chimpanzees, Matrioshka brains, and so on are topics of discussion.
<br>
<p>Extropianism is about transhumanism.  This implies a willingness to
<br>
contemplate fundamental changes in human nature. If your theory of rights
<br>
is derived from human nature, then you are ill-equipped to do business
<br>
with sapients that are non-human -- unless you can coerce them into
<br>
pretending to be human.
<br>
<p>Moreover, the natural rights theory of the 18th century is infused with
<br>
religiosity: the US constitution reeks of deism, and the country that
<br>
it belongs to has a higher per-capita proportion of fundamentalists than
<br>
just about anywhere on the planet except Afghanistan and Iran. If you
<br>
swim in that sea, it's hard to tell what colour the water is -- but to
<br>
an outsider, the tint is strikingly obvious. 
<br>
<p>*** I repeat: I am not discussing natural rights. I think natural rights
<br>
are incorrect and that a *better* paradigm for analysing rights exists,
<br>
just as the Einsteinian view of gravitation displaced the Newtonian
<br>
one. This isn't something I dreamed up overnight, either; it's been
<br>
floating around for quite a few decades and is quite common outside
<br>
your own parochial national boundaries. ***
