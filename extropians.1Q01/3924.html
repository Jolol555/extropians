<p><em>&gt; I began wondering, &quot;Wouldn't it be cool if we had an Extropy booth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the state fair?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes definitely!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it's a good idea, but what *would* an Extropy booth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look like?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're going to save the world right!?  We are the ones
<br>
offering real &quot;eternal salvation&quot;.  (as opposed to some neither world
<br>
after life garbage.) Real Eternal life and blissful heaven is just
<br>
around corner.  (sooner if we are all more worthy and make the right
<br>
choices and overcome the fear of technology).  If you are not
<br>
baptized, um I mean signed up for cryonic preservation, you'll miss
<br>
out and end up in hell, um I mean in the grave and suffer information
<br>
theoretical death right!?  For every $$ you fail to donate for
<br>
something like cancer research or cryonic research, it could mean yet
<br>
another one of our children will not make it to this heaven right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone interested in doing such a thing?  I'd be willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteer time if we had a great idea/theme/whatever...
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am.  But I couldn't drive to the state fair in Arizona, and
<br>
there aren't enough extropians in Colorado, let alone Northern Colora,
<br>
to man such a booth.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a very &quot;evangelistic&quot; extropian.  Doing anything I can in
<br>
an attempt to &quot;save the world&quot; or at least as many people as possible.
<br>
I think we should be a much better organized, have missionaries, and
<br>
everything.  Working on saving the world like this is tough.  It's so
<br>
hard to watch yet another loved one needlessly be buried to rot in the
<br>
grave.  I look forward to the day when we have more extropians to help
<br>
out with all this.  We just haven't reached critical mass yet.
<br>
