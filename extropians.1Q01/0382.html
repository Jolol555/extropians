<p>There is no silicon based intelligence now, I doubt there will ever

be. Silicon doesn't do intricate stable 3d structures very well, so
<br>
it probably has to be carbon (check out latest <a href="http://sciencemag.org">http://sciencemag.org</a>).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; based intelligence have different diets and different habitats.  I have

<p>Same diet: energy and atoms to build your substrate. Same energy, (mostly)
<br>
same atoms. Same habitat: surface of the Earth, at least initially.
<br>
Houston, we seem to have a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a notion that emotion is seated in intelligence.  Super intelligence
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily. You have to build it that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then means super emotions, and so... I hope this is how it works...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a super AI would love us.  It (or they) would see how it (or they)
</em><br>
<p>You can't build a super AI, no one is that smart. You can only create
<br>
a seed AI, an AI child, if you wish. If you make it basically human,
<br>
by looking which structures are created during neuromorphogenesis and
<br>
replicate their functions, and rear the AI child amongst the humans,
<br>
it will have similiar emotions. Initially. (Unless you broke something,
<br>
and raised a psychopathic AI without knowing it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and humans could work together, help each other, etc.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no reason why we and Si-AI should be enemies, since we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can coexist.
</em><br>
<p>No sir, superintelligence is something qualitatively different.
<br>
The positive autofeedback runaway which you cannot follow soon
<br>
confronts you with something incomprehensible. A supernatural
<br>
force of nature, if you so wish.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Another angle is this: a more advanced civilization has the luxury
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of trying to protect and preserve wildlife.  The western world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does this.  Those societies where people are starving have little
</em><br>
<p>Thank you, but the wildlife is dying just fine, despite the protection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; regard for preserving wildlife, eh?  So the AI would be a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced civilization, and we would be the wildlife.  Temporarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is, until we merge with the AI.
</em><br>
<p>So let's merge with the ants, and the nematodes, and the gastropods.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course this analysis could be wrong, we just dont know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will happen.  On the other hand, we *do* know exactly what
</em><br>
<p>Exactly: we don't know what will happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; will happen if we fail to develop nanotech and/or AI.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Yes, lowtech scenarios are more easily understandable, and none
<br>
of them look very pretty nor sustainable.
