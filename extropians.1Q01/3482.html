Oooh! This is a great thread, because I have come to view much of the 
<br>
newser's works as little more then biased, in what we receive as &quot;knowledge&quot;. 
<br>
More precisely,
<br>
the newsers seems to present half-truths, and pick people that agree with 
<br>
their opinions to interview, and thus present this as the news.  I completely 
<br>
understand the desire  for 'advocacy journalism', but when only part of the 
<br>
available 'truth' is presented; one cannot properly judge, or help find 
<br>
viable, solutions to problems.  
<br>
<p>This has pushed me farther to the 'right' out of frustration, then I have 
<br>
ever been in my life ( not that rightward is necessarilly, truth-ward).

<p>&lt;&lt; 1) find journalist(s) whose words you trust and weigh those in your
<br>
&nbsp;readings/viewings
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;2) ask your friends and colleagues, who have spent some time in the U.S.,
<br>
&nbsp;questions (and then *listen* to their answers).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;3) go spend some time there and experience for yourself. _that's_
<br>
&nbsp;the best way.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;BTW: I realize that the LA Times is local, and *should* be accurate, but
<br>
&nbsp;it still has a slant. As for the news reports that make it over
<br>
&nbsp;the Atlantic (International Herald Tribune, television, etc.):
<br>
&nbsp;Much of the media reports that the the Americans receive regarding
<br>
&nbsp;European life is just as slanted and skewed as the media reports that the
<br>
&nbsp;Europeans receive about American life. The writers have their bias,
<br>
&nbsp;so it's best to be skeptical.
