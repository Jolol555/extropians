Hey, All:
<br>
<p>One of the scientists in our (Wired's) story on human cloning 
<br>
publicly announced that he's going to go for it. This guy is a 
<br>
serious player in IVF, so this represents big news. Story below; and 
<br>
here's a link to our piece:

<p><p><p>Italian doc says he will clone human

<br>
<p><p>Italian doc says he will clone human
<br>
<p><p>LEXINGTON, Ky., Jan. 26 (UPI) -- An Italian doctor and fertility expert
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;told a lecture at Samaritan Hospital that he plans to attempt to clone a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;human being within the next year.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Severino Antinori of Rome said he is treating 10 couples -- including
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one American couple -- who are candidates for what he described as a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;therapeutic procedure. Antinori said this is the first time he has made his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;intentions public.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whether we like it or not, we will have cloned individuals in the very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;near future,&quot; said Dr. Panos Zavos, a friend of Antinori, who delivered his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lecture Thursday.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zavos told Friday's Lexington Herald-Leader, &quot;If it's done sensibly and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibly enough, I think there is a place for cloning in this world. It's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;going to happen.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonini, 55, who is known for his work in assisted reproduction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;techniques and in developing methods have allowed even women in their early
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;60s to get pregnant, said the chance to help infertile couples outweighs the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ethical objections to his procedure, which he describes as safe.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Life is important,&quot; he said. &quot;The goal to be a father, to be a mother, is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a human right, an absolute human right.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonini said the cloning attempt likely would be made somewhere in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mediterranean.
