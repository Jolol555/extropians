<em>&gt;Good point Sean, it would be nice to get an answer on that one.  Do people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here believe there is something inherently &quot;embarrasing&quot; about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Irishness?  This would strike me as an incredibly strange attitude given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the calibre of people on this list.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;James...
</em><br>
<p>It strikes me as a strange opinion for anyone at all to have. If there's a 
<br>
prejudice against people of Irish heritage, I'm unaware of it. Although I 
<br>
see how people recieving constant comments about something can get annoying, 
<br>
meaning comments about something which implies you're supposed to have some 
<br>
affiliation with what they're talking about, when you really have no idea 
<br>
what they mean (Example: When I went to college in Buffalo and talked to 
<br>
non-Buffalonians, they would frequently say &quot;Sorry about the Bills&quot;. I 
<br>
wasn't sure what a &quot;Bill&quot; was until I asked).
<br>
I love to tell the story about how my great grandfather came to the US from 
<br>
Ireland. England was being hard on Ireland at the time. An English soldier 
<br>
was burning all his crops as a result of some disagreement they had. My 
<br>
great grandfather (I never met him) shot the soldier, killed him, and left 
<br>
with his family to America that night.
