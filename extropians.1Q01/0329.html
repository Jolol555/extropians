<p>And how many of these weapons detonated?  None?   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nuclear warheads do not eat through their own

</em><br>
<p>And nanoreplicators would?  Why?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Three more bombs off Delaware and two in Texas the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Spain in 1966. Four more on Greenland in '68…
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Detonators have gone off. The same year we torpedoed

<em>&gt; our own sub with two nukes on board. Classified for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twenty five years. It's still going on; it just hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been declassified yet. The Russian record is, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, far worse.
</em><br>
<p>And despite all these mishaps, there were no nuclear explosions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to reactors: Browns Ferry, I believe it was, nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burned to the ground because some idiot with a LIGHTER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a candle was poking it into FLAMMABLE

</em><br>
<em>&gt; alongside the primary wiring. Windscale, Chernobyl,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three Mile Island all released radiation into the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And despite the most appalling of human stupidity, all these accidents
<br>
*combined* have killed only a small fraction of those who have died in
<br>
other industrial accidents.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We release self-replicating nannites,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ONCE, and it's over.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  Nanotech is not magic.  
<br>

<p>interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We are not competent to control nanotechnology
</em><br>
<p>Possible.  It is a more difficult problem than nuclear weapons and power,
<br>
since nanotech does not require exotic, easily controlled materials.
<br>
However, it is far from obvious that it is hopeless, as you seem to think.
