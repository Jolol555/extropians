<p>When you're done with radioactive materials, you can shoot some of them
<br>
far away.  This implies economical launch costs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Here's an idea, put two big concrete pilings a mile or so part. in the ocean where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are a quarter mile apart and hundreds of feet from the surface.  Surround the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; What a dinky little installation. Here's something I could pay from my cookie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jar money. (I'd wish).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It's just an example, I'm sure many like it exist.  For example, from
<br>
children's art there are sometimes fantastic installations and ships.
<br>
<p>About the algae, it worthwhile to grow it in the ocean if it can be
<br>
controlled.  There are various forms of aerobic and anaerobic
<br>
microorganisms that can convert biomass elements from one type of
<br>
biomass element to another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; area around the two pilings with an electric chain fence to discourage alge growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and fish swimming into the area.  Between the two pilings, hang a set of louvers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Never mind electrocorrosion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ha ha.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; that swing back and forth.  As the ocean current flows through, which it regularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will, then the kinetic energy could be converted to power.   Perhaps better, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's a lot of energy in the tides and the surf, but the energy density,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially peak energy density, does not make this a viable, practical option.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At least with our current materials, and means of engineering. Not to mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coarse grain/high installation threshold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an algae bank above it in a bubble growing methane and burning it there for power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be retransformed into methane through alternate algae photosynthesis, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could also start air repair.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seaborne structures are notoriously problematic, really. And if you're into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biomass for energy (why on earth? it doesn't make sense even for resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as long as our fossils are not completely depleted), why nonaquatic biomass?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I read the National Geographics magazine from the 60's and 70's about
<br>
some underwater installations.  There are submarines that patrol for
<br>
months at a time underwater.  There are water installations like bridges
<br>
and tunnels and oil platforms.
<br>
<p>Some &quot;big science&quot; is expensive because it provides large rewards.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Some people have states [sic] ideas of beaming power from space.  The way this happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that power is generated on the lit side of the moon using solar cells.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is beamed using high-power microwaves to those areas in the line of sight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where it is required.  Drawback:  misaligned microwave cooks area.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Photovoltaical [sic] satellites are actually great, the problem is that you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make them from terrestrial material as long as the launch costs and ecological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impacts of launches stay within an order of magnitude of state of the art (to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break this mere economies of scale won't do). So you have to wait for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until you can mine the Moon (NEA have to [sic] much delta vee and too much latency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for teleoperation to be for much use). So there's a very high technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threshold for that scheme, as seen from here and now (Jan 2001).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Btw: if you look at the power density, it is not an issue. But you *could*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus the power to high fluxes for special uses, for instance such as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missile shield (or nuking cities instead of just lunch). But of course the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem set shifts when your tech is high enough to have that much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware in the sky.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We're talking about electrical equipment, I wonder what the order is in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consumption of these products:  green pc, green monitor, iron, electric stovetop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; range, electric furnace, stereo, large television, 100W light bulb, dishwasher,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; microwave.  These are some typical home products.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Here's a guess:
<br>
<p>oven
<br>
iron
<br>
lighbulb
<br>
large television
<br>
stereo
<br>
green monitor
<br>
green pc
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think an order of magnitude improvement on power consumption to a typical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. household should be very attainable without paying a too hefty toll.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first thing to start with would do with insulation, passive solar and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heat exchangers in the ventilation pathways. But currently fossils are too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap for that, at least in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The price cap on power sounds kind of socialist or fascist.  It could probably use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some reregulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we should develop a more pragmatic attitude: whatever makes sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (on the *long* run) should gets done, whatever the motivation. Free markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or state regulations should be used, whatever fits best for the current task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think if the use nuclear power were tripled or perhaps quadrupled in the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; States, and the rollout of superconductor in products and local links to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; efficiency were done, then there would be a better situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As long as we don't have practical room temperature superconductors their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use is utterly nonviable. In any case, I'm rather fond of micrograin/grassroot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions to the faux &quot;energy crisis&quot;, because it shifts the power balance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to individuals and small groups of individuals. In a cliche, power to the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nukes are really really a nonsolution to a nonproblem at best, a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on their own at worst.
</em><br>
<p>We talk about decentralized power, but if there was one big fusion
<br>
tokamak then it could support a large grid.
<br>
<p>There are a lot of logistics to the utilities that might seem regular to
<br>
people that work or have worked with utilities, while the metrics seem
<br>
irregular to others within or outside of the context.
