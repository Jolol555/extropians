<p>There are several huge problems.  Like it being hideously expensive to
<br>
get much of humanity to Mars and established there.  Like there being no
<br>
known way the colony could break even or be self-supporting in less than
<br>
oh about a dozen generations.  That is a pretty slow to take hold backup
<br>
and pretty darn fragile - much more so than earth.  Like the dearth of
<br>
volunteers to go endure utterly horrid conditions and a huge likelihood
<br>
of death with no discernible golden lining for quite some time.  
<br>
<p>Exactly where do you believe the money will come from to fund such a
<br>
misadventure?
