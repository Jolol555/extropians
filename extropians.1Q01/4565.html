<p><em>&gt;This has been commonly reported in our local Florida papers. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There were so many people making mistakes that they quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realized that they would run out of ballots.  They stopped giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out ballots for corrections.  People were stuck with the choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;throwing away their entire ballot or submitting most of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;votes with at least one wrong vote on it.
</em><br>
<p>There was not one word of it here. I leave it to conspiracy
<br>
theoristists as to why.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Last I knew the majority of the uncounted absentee ballots were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;from the military, and it was the dems who tried to prevent their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;inclusion, so this would not have changed the outcome.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;There were a lot of technicalities argued on both sides. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Technically, absentee ballots without postmarks must be thrown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away. Military mail usually does not have postmarks, so military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;absentee ballots usually get thrown away.  The Republicans wanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to ignore this bad rule and allow the military ballots to count
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(because they  tended to favor Republicans).  On the other side,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technically, write-in votes for Al Gore are thrown out because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aren't supposed to write-in a candidate if they have a punch-hole. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Republicans threw these ballots out while Democrats wanted them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;counted.
</em><br>
<p>Incorrect, there is a federal law that specifically states that
<br>
military absentee ballots do not require postmarks.
<br>
<p>&lt;long list of other locally reported items deleted for brevity&gt;
<br>
<p>It seems like there are a number of problems to be corrected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Individual claims should be investigated. Some of the claims were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;erroneous however. After the democratic initiated telemarketer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;campaign was launched, the number of complaints was considerably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher than the number of votes cast for example.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I doubt that this is statistically possible.  The voter turnout
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was very high, certainly a majority.  Even if every single
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Democrat in the county called in to complain, they could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outnumber the total number of voters.
</em><br>
<p>This is my mistake for not being clearer. I was referinng to those
<br>
who called in saying they had accidentally voted for Buchanon (sp?)
<br>
this number was something like three times the total number of
<br>
votes received.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Although we may be sick of this topic, the controversy is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over. I believe that history will record that Bush was legally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;installed after Gore won the election because the counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanism was in error.
