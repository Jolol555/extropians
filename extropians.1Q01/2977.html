<p>Of course.  What I am proposing is not to reproduce earth civilization
<br>
on Mars.  This is a long-after-nano kind of task.  What I have in mind
<br>
is much more modest: preserving an example of earth-based life in
<br>
the event that Bill Joy is right: that we get nano and it gets away from
<br>
us and slays everything on the planet.
<br>
<p>I personally believe that we will eventually get nanotech and it will not
<br>
kill us, but I could be wrong.  Even if we do escape grey goo, there are
<br>
other threatening technologies that we will probably master but perhaps
<br>
not.  We are a warlike species.  There is a finite chance that we will
<br>
eventually wipe ourselves out.  We need to get someone living on Mars
<br>
before nanotech and before the singularity and hope for the best.
<br>
<p>We need not preserve civilization.  It has been shown that civilization
<br>
can develop quickly.  Ours did in a few 10 kiloyears, and most of the
<br>
real progress happened in the last couple hundred.  It could do so
<br>
again if need be, but the species needed billions to evolve.  spike
