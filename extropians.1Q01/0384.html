<p><em>&gt; I clearly didn't mean 2-4 when I said that principles were arrays of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbols.  (And, hey, if you'd had some charity, maybe you could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen that.  This is an area where bad ethos will get you in trouble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, try to engage with respect and empathy.  Try to figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how I could possibly be right.  You just might figure out what I meant
</em><br>

<p>Hi Dan (et al.)
<br>
<p>Whilst skimming, I stumbled across your above passage, and I must confess:
<br>
it gave me pause: it reflects a sentiment I too have held on not infrequent
<br>
occasion.
<br>
<p>We are all guilty, perhaps, of bad ethos, or rather, we are heavily given to
<br>
engaging each other as antagonists-- it is oft times more important for us
<br>
to be perceived as right rather than to illuminate rightness.
<br>
<p>It is very natural, and very human, especially for us damnable eggheads.
<br>
<p>However, in our continual scrambling for rightness, we pave over the
<br>
synergies we are capable of creating through collaborative effort.  Indeed,
<br>
strangely, positive feedback appears to extinguish conversation in this
<br>
mailing-list environment-- competition gives rise to far more dynamism. I'm
<br>
certain the longest and most recurring threads are those that are the most
<br>
contentious.
<br>
<p>It would be interesting, I think, if we were more often able to expend some
<br>
energy in pursuit of uplifting the arguments of others.  Never fear, I'm not
<br>
talking about suspending skepticism, but, rather, seeking rightness.  We
<br>
might more often cash in on the benefits of collaboration-- one need only
<br>
look to the markets to see the benefits of enhancing local collaboration
<br>
whilst maintaining aggressiveness in the macro-dynamic.
<br>
<p>I am deeply in favor of individual empowerment, but also recognize the value
<br>
of compromise in the face of holistic goal achievement.
<br>
<p><p>Ok, so now my 2001 resolution with regard to this list is to spend just
<br>
a -wee- bit more time seeking out my opponent's rightness.  Even better:
<br>
lets find a way to turn that approach into a positive attractor state with
<br>
regards to the volume of our dialogue.
