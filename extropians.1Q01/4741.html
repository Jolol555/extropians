Here are some excerpts from a new book by Michael Mandel. Some of the
<br>
possibilities he suggests are grim, but I don't mean for this post to be a
<br>
downer. There are always opportunities. Some people made fortunes during the
<br>
depression years of the 1930's. It's a simple fact that the stock market is
<br>
presently overvalued in terms of objective value of corporate assets (both
<br>
tangible and intangible and including such items as R&amp;D and [especially]
<br>
market development expenditures) and future cash flows. I have not yet seen
<br>
any evidence that would lead me to believe that such a situation can be
<br>
maintained indefinitely.
<br>
<p>An economy going into a phase of inflationary depression is especially
<br>
tricky. Ordinarily, one would want to be ready to take advantage of bargains
<br>
that arise as stock prices fall to more realistic values, but when one can't
<br>
rely on maintaining a strong cash position this is a problem. In the past,
<br>
converting a significant % of one's cash to precious metals has worked. Any
<br>
thoughts out there on what might work this time around if the economy heads
<br>
south?

<br>
<p><p>==============================
<br>
<p>The New Economy is not simply a more cosmopolitan version of the old
<br>
industrial economy, a faster model with better suspension and steering. It
<br>
is something very different.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the great strengths of the New Economy — and its great flaw as
<br>
well — is the blossoming of a systematic market mechanism devoted to finding
<br>
and funding technological and business innovation on a large scale.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mechanism includes venture capital funds, which funnel money from
<br>
pension funds and other large investors into high-risk, high-return new
<br>
businesses; stock exchanges that easily allow new firms to go public; a
<br>
large pool of sophisticated risk-taking capital; and a cohort of skilled
<br>
workers who are willing to take chances on working for new firms, in
<br>
exchange for the prospect of stock options and future wealth.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>So what’s the problem? It’s this: for the first time, the process of
<br>
technological and business innovation amplifies the normal rhythms of the
<br>
overall economy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding for innovation now depends on the state of the stock market and
<br>
the expected growth of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).
<br>
Technology has become synchronized with the ups and downs of the rest of the
<br>
economy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that the Old Economy business cycle has been replaced by
<br>
the New Economy tech cycle: longer expansions, followed by deeper and
<br>
harsher recessions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the upside, innovation and economic growth reinforce each other.
<br>
More money spent on innovation means faster growth with low inflation.
<br>
Faster growth and a rising stock market increase the incentives to invest in
<br>
innovation — which yields more startups, faster adoption of technology, and
<br>
more pressure on existing companies to keep up.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>But when a downturn starts, watch out. The powerful forces that have made
<br>
the New Economy so dynamic will begin moving in reverse — first slowly, then
<br>
faster and faster. Rather than being led by housing and autos, as in the
<br>
past, the next recession will be driven by the innovative sectors of the
<br>
economy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A falling stock market and a slowing economy will mean lower potential
<br>
payoffs even from successful startups, which will diminish the willingness
<br>
of venture capitalists and corporations to put resources into the risky
<br>
business of developing new innovations. The number of startups will decline,
<br>
the pace of innovation will slow, and prices for tech equipment will fall
<br>
more slowly or even start to rise, reducing the willingness of companies to
<br>
buy new technology.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s worse, as the wave of innovation slows, existing companies will
<br>
lose their fear of being overrun by new competitors. With less pressure from
<br>
rivals, and facing slower productivity growth and a squeeze on profit
<br>
margins, any increase in wages will immediately translate into higher
<br>
prices. Inflation will jump back in every sector of the economy.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Some of the most lauded features of the New Economy will come back to haunt
<br>
us. When venture capital dries up, so will the multitude of jobs being
<br>
funded by it. The young college and business-school graduates who joined the
<br>
dot.com revolution hoping for a quick score will be back living with their
<br>
parents. Stock options will become worthless pieces of paper.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unemployment rate will soar, affecting people who never expected to
<br>
be out of work. Almost 60 percent of the new jobs generated between 1995 and
<br>
2000 were managerial or professional jobs, and these will be hit hard by the
<br>
tech cycle downturn.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest cuts will happen among the people most intimately
<br>
associated with the New Economy — the web site designers, the marketers at
<br>
dot.coms, the consultants and investment bankers who rode the boom, and the
<br>
journalists who covered them. The shortages of information technology (IT)
<br>
workers will turn into surpluses
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>The deterioration of the U.S. economy will not happen overnight. The
<br>
protective institutions put in place in the 1930s will mean that there will
<br>
be no banking panic, no wholesale closing of factories, no moment where it
<br>
feels like the economy is in free fall. Even once the slowdown begins to
<br>
broaden and deepen, it could take a year or two for the U.S. to actually
<br>
slip into recession.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s bad enough. But if policymakers don’t respond quickly and
<br>
aggressively to the unfolding tech downturn, there’s a good chance that it
<br>
could morph into something deeper and more sinister — an Internet Depression
<br>
that drains the economy of its vigor for an extended period.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s instructive to look back at the events of 1929 and 1930. It took
<br>
about a year after the October 1929 stock market crash before businesses and
<br>
investors realized that they were not simply in a mild decline. In the
<br>
aftermath of the crash, the market actually rebounded, and for much of April
<br>
1930 the Standard and Poor’s index was up on a year-over-year basis.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it took at least a year before the effects of the 1990
<br>
Japanese stock market collapse percolated through that nation’s economy. The
<br>
Nikkei index peaked at the end of 1989 and then dropped by as much as 50
<br>
percent in 1990, triggering a decade-long slump. But well into 1991 — more
<br>
than a year later — capital investment was still rising rapidly, inflation
<br>
was accelerating, and the governor of the Bank of Japan was still talking
<br>
about the strong economy. The unemployment rate, which had dropped as low as
<br>
2 percent, did not rise over 2.2 percent until late in 1992.
