I promise these are my last remarks on the topic of _2001: A Space Odyssey_;
<br>
I'll make them, and then shut up about it for good! (It's considerably more
<br>
frivolous than my earlier posts, though, so be warned ;-&gt;)
<br>
<p>It has long been rumored that the letters &quot;HAL&quot; were derived by Clarke and
<br>
Kubrick by decrementing each of the letters in &quot;IBM&quot;, with the intention
<br>
of either saluting, or twitting (or both) the IBM Corporation.  Clarke has
<br>
strenuously denied this, even going so far as to include the denial as a
<br>
bit of dialog inserted into the novel _2010: Odyssey Two_ and also in his
<br>
foreword to David Stork's book _HAL's Legacy: 2001's Computer as Dream and
<br>
Reality_ (MIT Press, 1997) -- the text of this foreword is available at <a href="http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/foreword/foreword1.html">http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/foreword/foreword1.html</a>
<br>
(full texts of some of the chapters of _HAL's Legacy_ and abstracts of
<br>
others are also available at <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/contents.html">http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/contents.html</a> ).
<br>
Kubrick also insisted that the relationship between &quot;HAL&quot; and &quot;IBM&quot; was purely
<br>
coincidental, remarking in a newspaper interview &quot;It would have taken
<br>
a cryptographer to notice that.&quot; (quoted in the Kubrick FAQ
<br>
( <a href="http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/">http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/</a> ) in the answer to Question 7 &quot;What do the
<br>
letters HAL stand for and is there a connection with IBM?&quot;.  See also the article
<br>
&quot;Open the Pod Bay Doors, HAL&quot; by Roger Smith in the Jan. 2001 issue of
<br>
_Software Development_ on-line at
<br>
<a href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/articles/2001/0101/0101a/0101a.htm">http://www.sdmagazine.com/articles/2001/0101/0101a/0101a.htm</a>
<br>
<p>If the joke was ever intentional, it's clear that both Clarke and Kubrick
<br>
came to regret the possibility of being on the outs with IBM.  According to
<br>
&quot;Underman's 2001 FAQ&quot; at <a href="http://www.underview.com/2001/faqs/faqs.html#faqh">http://www.underview.com/2001/faqs/faqs.html#faqh</a>
<br>
(in the answer to Question 8), IBM initially provided advice and assistance
<br>
in the production of _2001_, but changed its corporate mind and withdrew
<br>
its support, not over HAL's name, but because the murderous computer
<br>
was seen as bad PR for the computer industry in general.  This sort of on-again,
<br>
off-again skittishness and paranoia is common enough when corporations
<br>
are asked for help by artists or litterateurs; I recall that Tracy Kidder
<br>
recounts a similar abrupt withdrawal of support by Data General during
<br>
the writing of _The Soul of a New Machine_ (Modern Library, 1981), and Edwin
<br>
Black says in the Introduction to _IBM and the Holocaust_ &quot;Since WWII, the
<br>
company has steadfastly refused to cooperate with outside authors.  Virtually
<br>
every recent book on IBM, whether written by esteemed business historians
<br>
or ex-IBM employees, includes a reference to the company's refusal to
<br>
cooperate with the author in any way.&quot;
<br>
<p>Be that as it may, there is also a visual element to the HAL/IBM pun which I
<br>
haven't seen noticed anywhere in print.  The logo on all of HAL's camera faceplates
<br>
is at the thin edge of visibility in home video formats, even in the closest
<br>
closeups, and even with a software DVD player scaling the picture to higher-than-TV
<br>
resolution on a computer monitor, but it's always been my impression that the logo
<br>
is in an outline font, and this is confirmed by the picture on p. 59 of the Piers
<br>
Bizony book, _2001: Filming the Future_ (you'll need a magnifying glass!).  The
<br>
HAL logo is also depicted that way (but with a spurious white outline surrounding
<br>
the box and separating the blue and black halves which is not present in the movie)
<br>
at the &quot;HAL Corporation&quot; Web site, as shown at <a href="http://guide.net/~mental/hal9000/hal_info.html">http://guide.net/~mental/hal9000/hal_info.html</a>
<br>
(the home page of the &quot;HAL Corporation&quot; is at <a href="http://guide.net/~mental/hal9000/index.html">http://guide.net/~mental/hal9000/index.html</a> ).
<br>
<p>Now compare this with <a href="http://www.teleport.com/~prp/collect/ibm709.jpg">http://www.teleport.com/~prp/collect/ibm709.jpg</a> , which
<br>
contains a logo similar to that which appeared on many IBM computers of the 50's
<br>
and early 60's, including the one which Peter Sellers appeared next to in
<br>
_Dr. Strangelove_ (see also <a href="http://www.teleport.com/~prp/collect/ibm7094.jpg">http://www.teleport.com/~prp/collect/ibm7094.jpg</a> ).
<br>
Unfortunately, HAL's logo is not in a serif font, and the letters are not solid white
<br>
rather than outline, both of which would have reinforced the joke.  There are other
<br>
differences, of course -- in the real IBM 709 nameplate, the left-hand blue portion of
<br>
the background just fits the flush-left company initials, the model number (also serif, and
<br>
with squarer 0's and 9's than HAL's) is flush right, and there's that 1/3-height silver
<br>
strip underneath with the words &quot;DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM&quot;.  The later
<br>
IBM 7094 nameplate in the second picture is a much closer visual match to HAL's
<br>
nameplate.  Recall, of course, that IBM does in fact get its proper name in the
<br>
film on the flight console of the Pan Am shuttle.
<br>
<p>To digress slightly, Peter Hyams' 1984 _2010: The Year We Make Contact_, while a
<br>
perfectly enjoyable movie on its own terms, does not measure up to the standards set
<br>
by the richness and attention to detail of _2001_, including the visual representation
<br>
of technology.  While the later film takes great pains to make Jupiter and its
<br>
satellites match the Voyager closeups, the resurrected and morally rehabilitated
<br>
HAL puts on a much shabbier face.  HAL's main display board in the centrifuge
<br>
on board Discovery in _2001_ is a visual feast, from the mysterious track-lit
<br>
glow surrounding the camera faceplate to the eerie black-lit fluorescence of the
<br>
distinctively-shaped display panels (according to the Bizony book [p. 123], these
<br>
displays were actually painstakingly-animated 16 mm. film projections):
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/2001/2001_HAL_small.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/2001/2001_HAL_small.jpg</a>  (8K)

<br>
In contrast, the rebuilt HAL display board in the Discovery cockpit as seen
<br>
in _2010_ is a bare-bones sketch of the original, with cheesy-looking conventional
<br>
mid-80's CRTs inset in cutouts in a black-painted wall replacing the animated projections
<br>
of the original movie and with less subtlety of lighting (notice the glare across
<br>
the roughly-painted wall and the absence of the soft glow around HAL's camera plate).
<br>
The outline font in the HAL logo is replaced by a bland, solid sans-serif font, and
<br>
the left-hand blue background has been darkened to the point of being barely
<br>
distinguishable from the right-hand black:
<br>

<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/2001/2010_HAL.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/2001/2010_HAL.jpg</a>  (134K)
<br>
<p>One final morsel of trivia from _2010_: if you've ever found yourself
<br>
unaccountably reminded of Murphy Brown while watching this movie, it may
<br>
be because the voice of HAL's &quot;sister&quot; SAL is performed by Candace
<br>
Bergen (credited as &quot;Olga Mallsnerd&quot;)!
<br>
<p>Cheers.
