Hooboy. Well, personally, I'd say the issue of these
<br>
foreign nations not using the things could just as
<br>
well be fear of US or international retaliation (after
<br>
all, which is the only nation ever to have used the
<br>
damned things?) as &quot;responsibility.&quot; Probably more
<br>
likely, in fact; some of these guys REALLY don't like
<br>
each other...
<br>
<p>Sure, accidents may be containable. Most probably
<br>
would be, no question. That's not my problem. My
<br>
problem is that there is a potential here--never
<br>
before seen--for a SELF-REPLICATING accident the
<br>
consequences of which expand exponentially and which
<br>
cannot be halted. Somewhat analogous to Teller's
<br>
side-bets on Trinity igniting the atmosphere in a
<br>
globe-spanning chain reaction. Meticulous calculations
<br>
showed that to be very, very, very unlikely, if not
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p>I'd love to see similar calculations regarding the goo
<br>
situation.
<br>
<p>I really would.

&gt; Your position rests, though, on one key principle:
&gt; that absolutely
&gt; nobody can be trusted. I think the fact that most
&gt; intelligence analysts
&gt; will admit that at least one if not more nuclear
&gt; weapons may be already
&gt; in the hands of one or more terrorist groups, yet
&gt; they have not been
&gt; used is a pretty good indicator that even the most
&gt; extreme individuals
&gt; can still have the capacity to retain some sanity in
&gt; their judgement.
&gt; The mere fact that the russians, chinese, cubans,
&gt; and others have had
&gt; them and not used them is a pretty good indicator
&gt; that most people are
&gt; pretty good at being responsible with such power.
&gt; Accidents do happen,
&gt; no doubt, however you have not shown any indications
&gt; that advanced
&gt; nanotech would be as uncontrollable as you claim.
&gt; You have no evidence
&gt; (nor, IMHO, any knowledged to judge) that any
&gt; accidents would not be
&gt; containable.

&gt; &gt; All true, all true--but irrelevant; point is it
&gt; can happen. Two further
&gt; &gt; points: nukes can be tracked, perhaps even by
&gt; satellite, by rad emissions,
&gt; &gt; making use difficult. Not so nannite packages.
&gt; Also, any party employing a
&gt; &gt; backpack nuke must fear massive retaliation from
&gt; the target nation. With
&gt; &gt; the proper nanoweapon, however, the target nation
&gt; can be obliterated,
&gt; &gt; making retaliation improbable and use more likely.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How long have they been missing? For years, so far
&gt; as I know. Not one
&gt; &gt; has been used. How about that?
&gt; &gt; Here's another question? How do we know they
&gt; actually had them to begin
&gt; &gt; with? Perhaps its just a matter of a commie
&gt; official reporting x number
&gt; &gt; were made and not actually making that many, then
&gt; pocketing the
&gt; &gt; difference. Not unheard of.
