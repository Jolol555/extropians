Ah, those Matrioshka brains, they love to huddle in the dark.

<p><p><p>Invisible galaxies:
<br>
<p>A trail of stars and gas reveals a dark matter galaxy, say astronomers 
<br>
<p><p><p>Stuart Clark
<br>
<p><p><p>Astronomers have detected a bridge of matter extending from a galaxy,
<br>
apparently, towards nothing.
<br>
Neil Trentham, Ole Moller and Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, at the Institute of
<br>
Astronomy, Cambridge, believe their finding means an invisible galaxy, made
<br>
entirely of dark matter, is lurking beside UGC 10214.
<br>
<p>Astronomers believe that up to 90% of the Universe is made of non-luminous
<br>
material that betrays its presence only through the action of its
<br>
gravitational field. What this dark matter is remains a mystery.
<br>
The group's work, suggests that dark matter galaxies might eventually be
<br>
found to outnumber ordinary galaxies by a hundred to one.
<br>
<p>Galactic collision 
<br>
<p>When galaxies collide it is common to see bridges of luminous material
<br>
being dragged from one to the other. Only in active galaxies are jets of
<br>
material seen emanating from individuals. 
<br>
But despite UGC 10214's apparent isolation, Trentham believes visible trail
<br>
is a bridge: &quot;It's too thick to be a jet from an active galaxy. Also, some
<br>
of the material is made up of stars and a jet would not push out stars.&quot;
<br>
Trentham has been working on formation theories for dark galaxies and
<br>
believes that they are celestial latecomers, incapable of making stars.
<br>
He told New Scientist: &quot;Galaxies grow from perturbations in dark matter.
<br>
Normal galaxies began forming in the couple of billion years after the Big
<br>
Bang. As the haloes grow, they pull in gas to form stars. 
<br>
&quot;Now imagine five to 10 billion years after the Big Bang. The gas sitting
<br>
out between the galaxies has been heated by starlight and is travelling
<br>
fast. A late forming halo can no longer hold onto it because its speed is
<br>
so high. And without gas, the galaxy cannot form stars.&quot;
<br>
Possible candidates for dark matter include subatomic particles or failed
<br>
stars, called brown dwarfs. If it is the latter, Trentham believes it may
<br>
be possible to see these dark galaxies by their infrared glow.
<br>
<p>----------
<br>
<p>The research will be published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
<br>
Society.
