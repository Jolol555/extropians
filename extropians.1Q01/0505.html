<p>
A few minutes ago I sent an email to the list that was meant to go to 
<br>
Damien personally.
<br>
<p>It was like this:  Damien and I had been discussing web sites and 
<br>
computers--I was in a terrible mood because my computer was not doing what 
<br>
I wanted it to, and I was cussing the poor thing, talking about taking a 
<br>
sledge hammer to it and so forth.
<br>
<p>Jason's riddles cheered me up. So I wanted to drop Damien a short note, 
<br>
because his answers to Jason's riddle were nice. Since we'd been talking 
<br>
about web sites, I commented that Jason's a web designer but that his site 
<br>
was too glizty and took too long to load--meaning for people like me who 
<br>
have slow connections. I've said this to Jason too (and he's well aware of 
<br>
it anyhow and has a notice to that effect on his site), but I would not 
<br>
have chosen to post it to the list in those terms. As I've also said to 
<br>
Jason and others, his site is a masterpiece if you have the equipment to 
<br>
view and hear it properly.
<br>
<p>So anyway, I apologize to all list members for cluttering the list with a 
<br>
personal message. And I apologize to you, Jason, for saying something about 
<br>
your web site that could have been interpreted as derogatory. And thank you 
<br>
for cheering me up by posting your riddle and Fanshawe's poem.
<br>
<p>Barbara
