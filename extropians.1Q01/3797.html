The only thing that annoys me about the whole &quot;folkways&quot; thing, is those 
<br>
who then go on to complain about losing it.  Kind of like the bemoaning of 
<br>
MacDonalds, yet having your breakfast there.  Countries are responsible for 
<br>
the preservation of their own culture.  They can decide to reject outside 
<br>
cultural influence.  Funny thing is, they're not half so annoyed when their 
<br>
own culture &quot;goes abroad&quot;.
<br>
<p>Whatever anyone might say about the British killing the Gaelic language, it 
<br>
stayed dead because we really couldn't have been bothered to resurrect it.

<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
