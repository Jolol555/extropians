<p><em>&gt;Another good example of translated poetry is in the work of Stanislaw Lem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translated from Polish to English.  The Cyberiad has two robots engaging in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a poetry duel.  One is challenged to write &quot;a poem about a haircut! But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lofty, nobel, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heroism in the face of certain doom! Six lines, cleverly rhymed, and every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word beginning with the letter &quot;s&quot;!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>for those wondering...
<br>
-------
<br>
<p>Seduced, shaggy Samson snored.
<br>
She scissord short. Sorely shorn,
<br>
Soon shackled slave, Samson signed,
<br>
Silently scheming,
<br>
Sightlessly seeking
<br>
Some saveage, spectacular suicide.
<br>
<p>&quot;Well what do you say to that?&quot; asked Trurl, his arms folded proudly.
<br>
But Klapaucius was already shouting:
<br>
<p>&quot;Now all in g! A sonnet, trochaic hexameter, about an old cyclotron who
<br>
kept sixteen artificial mistresses, blue and radioactive, had four wings,
<br>
three purple pavilions, two lacquered chests, each containing exactly one
<br>
thousand medallions bearing the likeness of Czar Murdicog the Headless...&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Grinding gleeful gears, Gerontogyron grabbed/Giggling gynecobalt-60 golems,&quot;
<br>
began the machine, but Trurl leaped to the console, shut off the power and
<br>
turned, defending the machine with his body.
<br>
<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; he said, hoarse with indignation. &quot;How dare you waste a great talent
<br>
on such drivel? Either give it decent poems to write or I call the whole thing
<br>
off!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What, those aren't decent poems?&quot; protested Klapaucius.
<br>
<p>&quot;Certainly not! I didn't build a machine to solve ridiculous crossword
<br>
puzzles! That's hack work, not Great Art! Just give it a topic, any topic,
<br>
as diffiicult as you like ...&quot;
<br>
<p>Klapaucius thought, and thought some more. Finally he nodded and said:
<br>
<p>&quot;Very well. Let's have a love poem, lyrical, pastoral, and expressed in
<br>
the language of pure mathematics. Tensor algebra mainly, with a little
<br>
topology and higher calculus, if need be. But with feeling, you understand,
<br>
and in the cybernetic spirit.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Love and tensor algebra? Have you taken leave of your senses?&quot;
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p><p>Thanks Chris! This delightlful book is on my my bookshelf, UNREAD still.
<br>
(OK, I peeked, to find the  6 line poem). Now moved up in my reading queue.

<br>
<p>who sees nothing nonsensical about love expressed in tensor algebra (with
<br>
a little bit of topology and higher calculus, of course)
