Borrowed from another site..........
<br>
<p>Efficiency of Waste Removal and Structural Repairs
<br>
<p>Workouts are hell on your muscles. They generate free radicals, produce 
<br>
lactic acid, cause microscopic tears in the muscles and tendons and 
<br>
basically turn your body into a metabolic scene reminiscent of Braveheart 
<br>
after the Scotts got their butts kicked. The faster your body can get rid of 
<br>
the dead (metabolic wastes) and fix the wounded (structural damage), the 
<br>
faster it can be ready for action.
<br>
<p>Faster and more complete recovery of this kind will lead to far more 
<br>
progress in the long run because of more quality workouts and less time lost 
<br>
to injuries. Unfortunately, forgetting about your body's recovery 
<br>
immediately after your post-workout shake isn't going to cut it.
<br>
<p>To claim victory here you have to form a multi-pronged attack. To speed the 
<br>
removal of the metabolic wastes after working out, simply use a cool-down 
<br>
(10 to 15 minutes of light aerobic activity) and stretch for 10 to 15 
<br>
minutes after that. Don't scoff; the cool-down is an essential part of 
<br>
recovery. It helps your heart pump fresh blood in and pump waste-ridden 
<br>
blood out of your muscles. Stretching helps to &quot;wring&quot; the muscles of even 
<br>
more of these casualties of war. Stretching after training also helps speed 
<br>
recovery since muscles won't really start to recover until they return to 
<br>
their normal length. (Strength training leaves the muscles in a shortened 
<br>
state.)
<br>
<p>As far as speeding the repair of structural damage, my first two 
<br>
recommendations involve supplements that will give your body the raw 
<br>
materials needed for the repairs. Protein is obviously key (preferably with 
<br>
most coming from whey and casein) and the recommendation of 1 to 1.5 grams 
<br>
per pound of bodyweight is usually sufficient. I also recommend using a 
<br>
glucosamine/chondroitin combination. Don't wait until you need it to start 
<br>
using this powerful supplement duo. The whole idea is to be aggressive and 
<br>
head off any problems before they arise.
<br>
<p>Stretching also helps speed the structural regeneration of your body, so 
<br>
take 15 minutes every day and stretch. I personally use and recommend the 
<br>
routine described in Ian King's article The Lazy Man's Guide to Stretching. 
<br>
Stop making excuses why you can't stretch. Put a towel by your couch so that 
<br>
when you're sitting there watching television you'll be reminded to get on 
<br>
the floor and stretch. Don't worry, you can still watch Tony Soprano whack 
<br>
people and get in a good stretching session.
<br>
<p>Lastly, make use of one of the most powerful (and least used) regeneration 
<br>
techniques — massage. Massage is perhaps the oldest technique known to 
<br>
mankind for speeding recovery and has an almost endless list of therapeutic 
<br>
affects including removal of metabolic waste, restoration of optimum muscle 
<br>
tension and length and circulation of lymph, just to name a few.
<br>
<p>You don't even have to shell out the $50+ dollars an hour to put it to work 
<br>
for you. All you need to do is find a massage school near you that has a 
<br>
student clinic. At these student clinics you can get an hour long full-body 
<br>
massage for $20 to $30. Since massage students must log a certain number of 
<br>
hours to receive their certifications, almost all schools have some form of 
<br>
this, so ask around. Get a massage two to four times a month and I'll 
<br>
guarantee that you'll feel and notice the difference.
<br>
<p>In battle, every good general knows that staying one step ahead of the enemy 
<br>
is the only way you can really hope to defeat him. Taking these steps will 
<br>
make sure your body can clean up the battlefield and get the reserves in 
<br>
place as quickly as possible to do just that.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Many sources of fitness advise advocate stretching or cooling down after a
<br>
workout to flush lactic acid from fatigued muscles.  This has clear
<br>
benefits of reducing soreness and reducing lost flexibility.
<br>
<p>I am curious, however, about the relationship between lactic acid and
<br>
promotion of new muscular growth.  By flushing the lactic acid from one's
<br>
muscles, is one reducing the muscle growth that will result from the
<br>
workout?
<br>
<p>Any input is appreciated.
<br>
<p>thanks,
<br>
