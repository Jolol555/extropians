<p>My doctor recommended that I contact the University of Washington to
<br>
participate in a controlled study of prescription marijuana.  I use it
<br>
therapeutically to increase my tactility when reintegrating my dissociated
<br>
kinesthetic memory.
<br>
<p>BRAIN TEASER: What would &quot;hardness and surveillance&quot; have to do with
<br>
nanotech and cryonics?
<br>
<p>Dear Extropians:
<br>
<p>I have been thinking a lot lately about &quot;institutions.&quot;  Which reminds me of
<br>
the term &quot;institutional momentum&quot; which I first heard in Engines of
<br>
Creation.
<br>
<p>My mother and I have some genes in common.
<br>
<p>Monday - thru - Friday, she wakes up at about 5am and sits in front of a
<br>
make-up mirror puting on her make-up.
<br>
<p>Around 7 am, she begins frantically running around the house looking for
<br>
various things: her purse, cell phone, paperwork.
<br>
<p>At about 7:30 she leaves for her job at Boeing, where she enters Software
<br>
Problem Reports into a database (about one a month).
<br>
<p>Most of the time, she surfs the web and files her nails.
<br>
<p>Our house is very cluttered, as she has way too many clothes for the amount
<br>
of storage space.  She also is obsessed with lipstick, and has a collection
<br>
of about 40 or so various shades.
<br>
<p>I mentioned to her that if I was at work where she works, I'd probably just
<br>
create a web-based form so the programmers on her project (IUS: inertial
<br>
upper stage) would be able to enter their own software problem reports.
<br>
Unfortunately, there wouldn't be much left for her to do.
<br>
<p>When I was a young kid, her job a Boeing was ferociously important to her,
<br>
as she was a military brat and it was her first real job.  She needed the
<br>
money after the divorce to pay the rent and take care of my brother and I.
<br>

<br>
<p>When I was 13 (the same year I stopped wetting the bed), she ended up
<br>
getting transferred from Vandenberg Air Force base, where she worked in
<br>
&quot;Hardness and Surveillance&quot;, to Seattle, where she worked with engineers who
<br>
put satellites into the proper orbit.  My brother and I stayed in
<br>
California, with my dad.

<br>

<br>
<p>She was alone up in Seattle, and was naturally quite depressed and loney.
<br>
She amused herself by participating in various self-help workshops (Context
<br>
Seminars, Gestalt retreats to Hawaii), and by participating in the Boeing
<br>
Psychic Club.
<br>
<p>We'd see her for 6 weeks each summer, in Seattle (got to see Mt. St. Helens
<br>
blow in realtime from Military Way over Southcenter).
<br>
<p>In October of 1998, I got kicked out of my apartment (Hastings East, 3355
<br>
Pennsylvania Avenue, Fremont, CA, across the street from Spoons restaurant)
<br>
for making too much noise late at night (I was learning about electrostatic
<br>
charge by rotating a Chinese Medicine Ball inside a Wooden Bowl).  I'd smoke
<br>
a little doobie and sit on the floor all night rotating the ball.  As a
<br>
System Administrator (SA) at SGI, I had some great video games that were
<br>
great to play when I.  Especially FOR-SA-KEN.
<br>
<p>(see

<br>
the-retina_floozer_ghost_tractor.jpg)
<br>
<p>I was short on cash.  Luckily, I had a SONY DCR-VX 1000 camcorder that I'd
<br>
purchased on the &quot;9 months same as cash&quot;[ 23% interest on all balance if not
<br>
paid in full with 9 months] from Fry's electronics.  I qualified for SONY
<br>
card and a $5000 limit when I put in my application.  I fibbed a little and
<br>
said that I was working for SGI, when really I was a contractor so my checks
<br>
came from the contract agency.  Anywell, Wells-Fargo had offered me a
<br>
balance transfer promotion, so I &quot;paid off&quot; the SONY card right away and
<br>
enjoyed having the camcorder sitting on the floor in my room 98.6% of the
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>I was out of cash and had an eviction notice.
<br>
<p>What the hell, I thought, place an ad in CLASSIFIEDS 2000 and sell the
<br>
camcorder at a $600 loss, good as new, still in the box.
<br>
<p>Got a lot of calls that sounded suspicious, then one that sounded valid from
<br>
a sweet old lady named &quot;Virginia Andrews&quot;.  She called on Thursday and
<br>
wondered if I could ship it C.O.D. on Friday for overnight weekend delivery
<br>
on Saturday before noon.  It was her husbands birthday and he really wanted
<br>
a camera.  Sure, I said.
<br>
<p>2 weeks later I got the check from UPS and deposited it no problem.  Now I
<br>
had over $3000 in my checking account, so I'd be able to pay first and last
<br>
on a new apartment.
<br>
<p>What the heck, I'll go up and visit Mom.  She's so fucking lonely and
<br>
depressed.  Maybe I can help her move out of the apartment and get into a
<br>
house so she can have a dog.  That'd be some companionship so she wouldn't
<br>
have to sleep on the floor in the living room all the time because she
<br>
didn't &quot;have the energy&quot; to take the piles of clothes and shoes off of her
<br>
bed because there was just too many things that needed ironing and to be
<br>
sorted out for goodwill.
<br>
<p>I put my shit in storage and drove up to Seattle (with my PC).
<br>
<p>After spending about a week with my Mom and helping her clear a path between
<br>
the living room and her bedroom, I was encouraged to see that the rent for
<br>
homes was much lower in Federal Way than in Silicon Valley.  I could help
<br>
her get moved by her birthday on October 30th, then go back to Silicon
<br>
Valley where I was raking in the dough.  I went to the cash machine to get
<br>
some weed money and there was no cash available.
<br>
<p>Couldn't get anyone from the bank on the phone for a few days, but had to
<br>
act quick.  They said the check was counterfit.  I did some research on
<br>
Virginia Andrews and found a few of them in the phone book, but none with
<br>
the same address.  So I went to MAPQUEST and looked up the address.  It was
<br>
on the corner of some street by the railroad tracks in Watts, in Los
<br>
Angeles.  Shit!  I fucked up.  Called the detective in the area and he just
<br>
chuckled.  &quot;There's nothing we can do,&quot; he said.  Gangs do this all the
<br>
time.  Golf clubs, computers, camcorders.  All kinds of stuff.  They just
<br>
get Quicken or something and plug in the logo of a bank and go ahead and
<br>
make a laser printout on a blank check that looks real.  Sorry, you're out
<br>
of luck&quot;.  He said, as he finished his doughnut.

<br>

<br>
<p>Anyway, I love my mother.  She had a &quot;Sim&quot; and was gone for a while, so I
<br>
hooked up with some chick at Denny's with big tits and warm hands.  She said
<br>
she worked at Boeing.  I got my mom's bed cleared off in a few minutes and
<br>
had a lot of fun.  Changed the sheets before my mom got back.  Found a house
<br>
down the street, and got a two-bedroom.  Luckily it was a problem with my
<br>
mom.
<br>
<p><a href="http://ifeden.com/1/teeth1.jpg">http://ifeden.com/1/teeth1.jpg</a>
<br>
<p>She has a nice smile, but she's been having trouble maintaining that smile,
<br>
lately.  &quot;You put me through hell,&quot; she says, referring to the two-weeks I
<br>
spent confined in Western State Hospital as a result of the 24-Hour Fitness
<br>
Supplements/DejaVu nightclub trial.
<br>
<p>Anyway, anytime I criticize Boeing as being a &quot;tyrannical bureacracy&quot;, she
<br>
says &quot;Shut Up!  My job's done a lot for you.  Boeing paid for your braces.
<br>
Boeing bought your clothes.  Boeing pays [my half of] the rent.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yeah, I guess she's right.
<br>
<p>So if I were working there, would I &quot;automate&quot; her job and give her a pink
<br>
slip (or golden handshake), or would I just be cordial and try to politely
<br>
look the other way as she surfs the web all day between e-mails gossiping
<br>
about the cat-fights between secretaries.  She's also obsessed with making
<br>
it to the next &quot;Sim&quot; in Sunnyvale, where she normally makes the coffee.
<br>
<p>Anyway, since I love her and realize she's been doing this almost 30 years
<br>
and doesn't have a lot of initiative left (on the surface), it would present
<br>
quite a &quot;Catch 22 (my jersey number in pee-wee footbal league)&quot;.
<br>
<p>Then I realized something: she's probably just like all the &quot;government
<br>
workers&quot; that are effected by downsizing of the government.
<br>
<p>When I think about all the government bureacracies in school districts,
<br>
courts, city, county and state government...  it's basically a lot of people
<br>
in a similar situation: file clerks when are running out of paper and things
<br>
to do.
<br>
<p>Best solution, I think, would be to just keep paying her the normal salary,
<br>
but tell her to please go home and play so she's out of the way of the
<br>
engineers and not slowing things down.  Funny how such a simple business
<br>
decision would actually improve the efficiency of the Software Engineers who
<br>
launch our spy satellites.
<br>
<p>Just a thought...
<br>
<p>Anyway, she makes it out of the office sometime before 5:30 every day, and
<br>
manages to tolerate the hour commute back home, where she does her nails and
<br>
watches tv.
<br>
<p>On weekends, she normally sleeps in until around 1:30 or so, then lollygags
<br>
around the house saying she can't go out because she's &quot;got a lot to do,
<br>
like clean up her room and sort out the shed.&quot;  She's been saying the same
<br>
thing for about 2 years.
<br>
<p>Last week month she was going through my things and found about 1/2 of a
<br>
joint.  (It was the first I'd had in about 18 months, and costed $100).  She
<br>
flushed it down the toilet when I was asleep.  A few days ago, she called my
<br>
psychiatrist to tell him that I was smoking with my meds when I wasn't
<br>
supposed to be, and suggested that maybe I spend a few days in the hospital.
<br>
<p>Having just spent 14 days in a hospital (at a cost to the state of
<br>
$330/day), I thought a voucher system might be better.
<br>
<p>I could have spent the money on a trib to Club-Med in Mexico, or maybe a
<br>
week or so in Amsterdam.
