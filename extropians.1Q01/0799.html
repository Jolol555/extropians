I'm reading it now. The science is good, obviously,
<br>
and I'm not all the way through it, but holes appear
<br>
in the first few paragraphs. For example--the comment
<br>
that a stealth buildup would take 20 mo to accomplish
<br>
and that a more rapid buildup would be detected,
<br>
thereby enabling defenses to be deployed.
<br>
<p>Yah, right.
<br>
<p>WHAT defenses? The basic problem, of course, is that
<br>
you really need a nanodefense--and that you can't
<br>
possibly develop one until (as Drexler has pointed
<br>
out) the tech is already here.
<br>
<p>Therefore: If the first guy/nation/AI to develop the
<br>
tech screws up or goes psychotic, detection becomes
<br>
quite irrelevant because there ARE no defenses.
<br>
<p>As to the little buggers not devouring the planet's
<br>
core because of meltown--well, that hardly matters to
<br>
us, does it?
<br>
<p>But, as I say, I'm still looking it over. Homework is
<br>
what I'm doing; that's why I'm here.
<br>
<p>Thanks to you and those others who've provided helpful
<br>
links. Last time I plowed through foresight in-depth,
<br>
the ecophagy piece wasn't there.

&gt; Jeeze, Mr. Marlow. Do
&gt; your freaking homework. Please. Get a copy of the
&gt; Freitas paper from
&gt; Foresight.
&gt; 
&gt; www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html. Read it.
&gt; It's the first paper
&gt; on the subject of any detail. As I say, I think some
&gt; of what he says is
&gt; arguable.

&gt; &gt; I'd love to see similar calculations regarding the

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I really would.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Your position rests, though, on one key
&gt; principle:
&gt; &gt; &gt; that absolutely
&gt; &gt; &gt; nobody can be trusted. I think the fact that
&gt; most
&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence analysts
&gt; &gt; &gt; will admit that at least one if not more nuclear
&gt; &gt; &gt; weapons may be already
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the hands of one or more terrorist groups,
&gt; yet
&gt; &gt; &gt; they have not been
&gt; &gt; &gt; used is a pretty good indicator that even the
&gt; most
&gt; &gt; &gt; extreme individuals
&gt; &gt; &gt; can still have the capacity to retain some
&gt; sanity in
&gt; &gt; &gt; their judgement.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The mere fact that the russians, chinese,
&gt; cubans,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and others have had
&gt; &gt; &gt; them and not used them is a pretty good
&gt; indicator
&gt; &gt; &gt; that most people are
&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty good at being responsible with such
&gt; power.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Accidents do happen,
&gt; &gt; &gt; no doubt, however you have not shown any
&gt; indications
&gt; &gt; &gt; that advanced
&gt; &gt; &gt; nanotech would be as uncontrollable as you
&gt; claim.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You have no evidence
&gt; &gt; &gt; (nor, IMHO, any knowledged to judge) that any
&gt; &gt; &gt; accidents would not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; containable.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All true, all true--but irrelevant; point is
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; can happen. Two further
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; points: nukes can be tracked, perhaps even by
&gt; &gt; &gt; satellite, by rad emissions,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making use difficult. Not so nannite packages.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, any party employing a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; backpack nuke must fear massive retaliation
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; the target nation. With
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the proper nanoweapon, however, the target
&gt; nation
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be obliterated,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making retaliation improbable and use more
&gt; likely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How long have they been missing? For years, so
&gt; far
&gt; &gt; &gt; as I know. Not one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has been used. How about that?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's another question? How do we know they
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually had them to begin
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with? Perhaps its just a matter of a commie
&gt; &gt; &gt; official reporting x number
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were made and not actually making that many,
&gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; pocketing the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difference. Not unheard of.
