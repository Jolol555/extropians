(Reposted from the last time we discussed the Clock of the Long Now.)
<br>
<p>==
<br>
<p>In the western spiral arm of our galaxy lies a star system and a planet
<br>
occupied ages ago.  On one mountain of that planet there is a great
<br>
structure, thousands of cubits tall.  It is constructed of sapphire and
<br>
diamond, is self-repairing, and derives energy from both solar power and
<br>
an internal power supply which we still do not understand.
<br>
<p>Each solar rotation, this vast mechanism emits a tick.  Each hundred
<br>
rotations, it emits a gong.  Those who study the mechanism believe that
<br>
every ten thousand rotations, a small mechanism will appear from a certain
<br>
door and make a sound.  The last effect has not been observed in living
<br>
memory, and the next occurrence is projected to be nearly eighty
<br>
generations removed from those now living.  Xenoarchaeologists say that
<br>
the gong's period was longer than the lifespan of an individual of that
<br>
species, and that the unseen mechanism has a period longer than that
<br>
species' entire recorded history.  The entire edifice was constructed only
<br>
a few years before that race vanished forever to wherever ancient races
<br>
go.
<br>
<p>Philosophers across the galaxy have argued over the purpose of the
<br>
Eternal Clock.  As with other artifacts such as the Diamond Book, the
<br>
Circle of Time, the Oracle, and the Wandering Flame, consensus holds
<br>
that the motive was not religious or superstitious in nature, but
<br>
philosophical.
<br>
<p>What principle the Eternal Clock was intended to embody is still a matter
<br>
of great controversy.  But while arguments rage in the halls of
<br>
philosophy, while children are born and great-grandparents die, while
<br>
intelligent races evolve and vanish, the Eternal Clock continues to tick. 
<br>
And perhaps that is the message it is intended to convey.
