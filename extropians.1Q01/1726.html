Physicists bring light to a stop
<br>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA
<br>
AP Science Writer
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(AP) - Physicists say they have brought light particles to a
<br>
screeching
<br>
halt, then revved them up again so that they could continue their
<br>
journey at a blistering 186,000 miles per second.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are the latest in a growing number of experiments
<br>
that manipulate light, the fastest and most ephemeral form of
<br>
energy in the universe.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, researchers hope to harness its speedy properties in
<br>
the development of more powerful computers and other technologies
<br>
that store information in light particles rather than electrons.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiments were conducted in separate laboratories in
<br>
Cambridge, Mass., by groups led by Lene Vestergaard Hau of Harvard
<br>
and the Rowland Institute of Science and Ronald L. Walsworth and
<br>
Mikhail D. Lukin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for
<br>
Astrophysics.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results will be published in upcoming issues of the journals
<br>
Nature and American Physical Letters.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicists who did not participate in the experiments said the
<br>
two research papers make an important contribution to understanding
<br>
the properties of light. However, any practical applications are
<br>
far off, they said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``It's a real first,'' said Stanford physicist Stephen Harris,
<br>
who collaborated on a 1999 experiment with Hau that slowed light to
<br>
38 mph. ``These experiments are beautiful science.''
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latest experiments, researchers took steps to not only
<br>
slow light to a virtual crawl, but to stop it completely.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so, they created a trap in which atoms of gas were chilled
<br>
magnetically to within a few-millionths of a degree of absolute
<br>
zero and a consistency they described as ``optical molasses.''
<br>
Hau's group used sodium atoms, while Waldsworth's group used
<br>
rubidium, an alkaline metal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, the gas atoms would absorb any light directed into the
<br>
trap. The researchers solved this problem by aiming a ``control''
<br>
laser beam into the gas, which transformed it from opaque to a
<br>
state known as electromagnetic ally induced transparency, or EIT.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they shined a second, probe laser that operated at a
<br>
different frequency. When the wave of light particles hit the gas
<br>
atoms, the particles slowed dramatically.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop the probe light entirely, the researchers waited until
<br>
it had entered the vessel, encountered the gas atoms and imprinted
<br>
a pattern into the orientation of the spinning atoms.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the scientists gradually reduced the intensity of the
<br>
control beam.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the probe light dimmed and then vanished. But
<br>
information in the light particles still was imprinted on the atoms
<br>
of sodium and rubidium, effectively freezing or storing it,
<br>
according to Hau.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the scientists gradually restored the control beam. The
<br>
light that had been stored in the spinning atoms was reconstituted
<br>
and continued its journey through the vessel.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``It's as if you stretched a silk thread across a railroad track
<br>
and a train vanishes into it,'' said University of Colorado
<br>
physicist Eric Cornell, who reviewed the Hau study for Nature.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``You wait and then _ bam! _ the train reappears and goes
<br>
zooming down the track,'' Cornell said. ``It's not at all what you
<br>
would expect from a pulse of light.''
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 50 percent of the light _ and its information _ was
<br>
retrieved in the regenerated light pulse, scientists said. That
<br>
might not be good enough for a practical computing system, but it
<br>
demonstrates how such a system might store and ship data.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``Nothing is ready to be picked up by the optical communications
<br>
industry,'' Harris said. ``It needs further invention.''
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether either group actually stopped the light completely is
<br>
open to some interpretation. The probe laser actually is a bundle
<br>
of light waves that form a single wave. This is known to physicists
<br>
as the group velocity; it is the light that your eye sees and a
<br>
camera uses to record an image.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does stopping the group velocity means that the individual light
<br>
waves themselves were stopped? That's a deeper quantum question,
<br>
physicists said, but they considered the Cambridge groups' claims
<br>
to be valid.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``It is a real effect,'' said Ben Stein of the American Physical
<br>
Society.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manipulating light's properties is a subject of intensely
<br>
competitive research. In July, physicists in Princeton, N.J.,
<br>
apparently pushed a laser pulse through a vapor of cesium atoms so
<br>
it traveled faster than the conventional speed of light.
