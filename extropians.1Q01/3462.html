Wow Zeb,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to have a number of friends and acquaintances who have become police officers, and without exception they did so for the same reason I joined the Navy.  A deep abiding respect for the good things this society has to offer and a desire to ensure that it will continue to offer those things in the future, coupled with the willingness to put ones own life on the line to ensure that happens.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that there are many &quot;Cops&quot; out there who are willing to be abusive of the power situation they have over any citizen, though I would imagine that much of that arises from the constant uncertainty in any situation that they may be involved in (remember that Officers have been shot at &quot;routine&quot; traffic stops.)
<br>
<p>Just my 2 cents
<br>
<p><p>John calvin
