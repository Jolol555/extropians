The efficiency of a rocket depends on its exhaust velocity, the faster the better.
<br>
The space shuttle's oxygen hydrogen engine has a exhaust velocity of about
<br>
4500 meters per second and that's pretty good for a chemical rocket,
<br>
the nuclear heated rocket called NERVA tested in the 1960's had a exhaust velocity
<br>
of 8000 meters per second, and ion engines are about 80,000. Is there any way to
<br>
do better, much better, say around 200,000,000 meters per second? Perhaps.
<br>
<p>The primary products of a fission reaction are about that fast, but if you use
<br>
Uranium 235 or Plutonium 239 the large bulk of the material will absorb the
<br>
primary fission products and just heat up the material, that slows things way down.
<br>
However the critical mass for the little used element Americium-242 (half life about
<br>
a century) is less than 1% that of Plutonium. This would be great stuff to make a
<br>
nuclear bomb you could put in your pocket, but it may have other uses.
<br>
<p>In the January issue of Nuclear Instruments and Methods Physics Research A
<br>
Yigal Ronen and Eugene Shwagerous calculate that a metallic film of Americium 242
<br>
less than a thousandth of a millimeter thick would undergo fission. This is so thin
<br>
that rather than heat the bulk material the energy of the process would go almost
<br>
entirely into the speed of the primary fission products, they would go free.
<br>
They figure a Americium-242 rocket could get to Mars in two weeks not two years
<br>
as with a chemical rocket.
<br>
<p>There are problems of course, engineering the rocket would be tricky and I'm not sure
<br>
I'd want to be on the same continent as a Americium 242 production facility,
<br>
but it's an interesting idea.
