You wanna practice full disclosure? Here's what happened to the likes 
<br>
of David Horowitz, NBC, ABC, AP, etc.--in full view of one another. 
<br>
What do you think would happen to YOU, alone, on a lonesome road (or 
<br>
crowded freeway, for that matter)?
<br>
<p>Your intentions may be good--but you know where that road leads...

<p>As one photog put it:
<br>
<p>“There’s clear time on both sides to recognize who we are, who the 
<br>
police are and who the press is. And you know, we are supposed to 
<br>
have a white flag,” Crespo said. “I was in Kosovo last year, you 
<br>
know, and I didn’t get shot there. I got shot in Los Angeles.”
