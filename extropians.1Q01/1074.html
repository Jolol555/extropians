Mike Lorrey said some stuff, which I quote out of order and interject
<br>
comments on:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Read gun magazines and books,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become one of those guys at the grocery story people look leery at for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading 'those gun magazines'
</em><br>
<p>Warning! Warning!
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, most gun magazines exist, like most car magazines, to
<br>
sell copies of themselves and thus to sell advertising. No matter how
<br>
knowledgeable a single author sounds, do not swallow any &quot;party line&quot;
<br>
whole. Be skeptical. Keep learning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If stopping power is what you are interested, dropping a perp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately with little chance of him continuing an assault, then you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to use a larger caliber pistol round, from 9mm, .40, .45 ACP, .45
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Special, .45 Long Colt, .44 magnum, .454 Casull, or .480 Ruger. Hollow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point ammo, especially +P powered hollow point like Cor-Bon is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective in stopping a perp, but oddly enough less likely to kill them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from wounds than a small caliber like .22 (because they don't go into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shock as easily from smaller calibers, they bleed easier).
</em><br>
<p>Umm. Well. *Ahem*. The Marshall and Sanow notion of the ultrafast light
<br>
projectile in larger calibers sure seems to sell a lot of magazines. 
<br>
<p>However, there is a lot of terminal ballistics work by Dr/Col Martin
<br>
Fackler and others that suggests that &quot;big, slow&quot; does most jobs better
<br>
than Cor-Bon. So, for instance: One of the best rounds for .40 Lib is
<br>
the 180 Gr. JHP Golden Saber from Remington, which dawdles along at just
<br>
about the speed of sound. 
<br>
<p>Check out the work of the International Wound Ballistics Assn. and Peter
<br>
Kasler's book _Business Partners_.
<br>
<p>Never count on &quot;stopping power&quot;. Always count on placing shots until the
<br>
assailant stops.
<br>
<p>IIRC, some LEOs in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area alternate hollow points
<br>
and ball (regular bullet-shaped bullets with a funny name for historical
<br>
reasons) on the theory that hollowpoint might not penetrate far through
<br>
an assailant's layered winter clothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, 9mm and .40 Liberty are the primary self defense calibers, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .45 ACP and .44 magnum close behind. .454 Casull is a powerhouse round
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that only a well built man over 6 feet can really handle with ease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, if concealability is your thing, then you could look at a .25, .32,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or .357 caliber gun. SeeCamp, and some clone companies make some decent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very compact .32 caliber autoloaders that fit in the pocket of one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; khakis with little or no 'printing' or sag. 
</em><br>
<p>With smaller calibers, placing shots properly is even more important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Airlite .357 and .38
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special revolvers from S&amp;W and Taurus are made from titanium and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely light with similar concealability.
</em><br>
<p>There are also small .45 ACP weapons with slightly higher capacity well
<br>
worth considering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Before you choose your gun, make some friends at a local club and tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them you are shopping and would like to try what they have if they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing.  Don't buy your first gun new from the manufacturer,
</em><br>
<p>Also: don't be flummoxed or confused by all the different calibers, etc.
<br>
Manufacturers like to come up with new things to sell. As a result, the
<br>
actual diameters of many bullets with different names are surprisingly
<br>
close. 
<br>
<p>Important example: A .38 Special round is actually just about the same
<br>
physical size as .357 Magnum, BUT NOTE that you don't want to shoot .357
<br>
Magnum in a gun built to shoot only the lighter, older .38 Spl
<br>
cartridge. And it's a bad idea to shoot +P or +P+ higher-velocity loads
<br>
in a weapon that was not built to take the strain of these &quot;hot&quot; loads. 
<br>
<p>There is an excellent CD-ROM available for book-learning about firearms,
<br>
as an adjunct to real training from a real live instructor. I'll post
<br>
the URL if there's interest.
