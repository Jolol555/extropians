<p><em>&gt; This is what I was getting at. As the transparent society technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  approaches, society will increasingly face the dilemma of what to do when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  they find that under the existing laws &quot;everyone&quot; is a criminal in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  aspect of their life. The USA found that the Prohibition laws were ruining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their society so they scrapped them. Today the USA prisons are filling up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with soft drugs users and again ruining many lives unnecessarily. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  prisons will continue to fill up until they see sense once again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Advanced technology can be used to detect more and more &quot;crime&quot; but there 
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt;  no point to it. Prison will have to be restricted to serious criminals. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  see this speed limit technology as a sign of the way things will go in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  future. Rather than detection and punishment , which is very expensive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  society will go the cheaper route of either stopping the crime from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  happening or scrapping minor offences which are too much trouble to bother
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with.
</em><br>
<p>There's a very interesting question implied in these observations that has a 
<br>
vital implication for transhumanism.  I was led to this question by reading 
<br>
the above and asking myself why Prohibition (of alcohol) only lasted about a 
<br>
decade in the US, but the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; has dragged out much longer, has had 
<br>
effects on US society that seem to be MUCH more damaging, and yet shows no 
<br>
signs of abating.  Perhaps the answer is also suggested by the above: 
<br>
Prohibition of alcohol sought to change long-established patterns of 
<br>
consumption and behavior existing in a large segment of the society, while 
<br>
WIDESPREAD use of the drugs attacked in the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; has been a 
<br>
relatively recent phenomenon in the US (mainly since the mid-1960s).
<br>
<p>This observation doesn't bode well for the capacity of society to accommodate 
<br>
the kind of change we seek.  Yes, there does seem to be a tendency for the 
<br>
law to &quot;back off&quot; when it attempts to prohibit behavior that a large segment 
<br>
of the population will engage in regardless of that prohibition.  Thus repeal 
<br>
of the prohibition on alcohol and the 55 mph speed limit.  But when it comes 
<br>
to accommodating new kinds of behavior deemed threatening by a significant 
<br>
segment of the population, the legislative and enforcement apparatus appears 
<br>
to be much less flexible.
<br>
<p>I'm afraid that social conservatives may be much more tempted by improved 
<br>
techniques of surveillance and enforcement to &quot;nip in the bud&quot; the kinds of 
<br>
augmentation technology we seek, simply because it will not be widespread at 
<br>
first and won't have a well-established base of acceptance in society.  This 
<br>
makes current efforts at cultural accommodation of change in general and 
<br>
augmentation of the human animal in particular all the more important.
