I think all this is pretty doubtful.. Stirling engines are not what I would
<br>
call a &quot;mass consumer&quot; product, which is supposedly what IT is. And as you
<br>
see, it is not a secret they are working on that.
<br>
<p>And it also doubtful that it is anything like the hockey puck thing that
<br>
would require new city infrastructure even before it could be used. The
<br>
article states they expect this to be the most successful startup in history
<br>
within its first year- can't do that if you have to build new highways first.
<br>
<p>I am sticking with either personal telepresence robot, or maybe some kind
<br>
of personal helicopter. I don't think it can be any kind of normal ground
<br>
transport since that doesn't solve the existing traffic problems in cities.

<em>&gt; &gt; This guy was the subject of an article in WIRED months ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supposedly he was working on perfecting the Stirling (sp) engine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for use as a portable power source.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW I found the original article forwarded here at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.inside.com/it.html">http://www.inside.com/it.html</a>.  They also have a message board where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people can put up their guesses, which is where I think the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air-hockey puck idea came from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Wired article Brian mentions was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/kamen.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/kamen.html</a>:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Lately, Kamen has broadened his work beyond health care. He believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     technology and ingenuity can solve all kinds of social ills - like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     pollution, limited access to electricity, and contaminated water
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     in many third-world countries, where bacteria from human feces in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     drinking water is a leading cause of cholera. To help ameliorate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the water problem, Deka's team of 170 engineers is working on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     nonpolluting engine - funded by several million dollars of Kamen's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     own money - based on a concept first floated in the early 1800s but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     never realized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The device is called the Stirling engine; Kamen hopes it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     developed into an affordable, portable machine that will run a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     water purifier/power generator that could zap contaminated H20 with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a UV laser to make it safe for drinking. &quot;It can burn any fuel, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     you can do all kinds of things with it,&quot; he says. &quot;It might be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     valuable in emerging economies, giving them access to electricity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     even the Net.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds like a likely guess given the size of the device described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the article (fits in a duffle bag, roughly).  However the Wired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article goes on to say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Another project, to be unveiled in the next year, will necessitate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     building &quot;the largest company in New Hampshire,&quot; Kamen says with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     characteristic bravura. He's shy about details, except to say it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     involves a consumer device unrelated to health care and will require
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     $100 million in financing. Among the investors: Kleiner Perkins.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The secrecy might point to this as IT rather than the Stirling engine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although it could be misdirection, the factory actually being for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing the engine.
