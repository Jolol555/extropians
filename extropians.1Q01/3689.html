<p>Although that is a common stereotype I think it is incorrect.  I believe
<br>
that many scientists are amazing communicators and many are crappy
<br>
communicators.  I suspect that as compared to non-scientists, the population
<br>
of scientists may have a higher mean communication ability - I'm just
<br>
guessing that more intelligent people tend to be able to communicate clearer
<br>
on average.  This stereotype may result from the fact we notice those
<br>
scientists that cannot communicate well more because we are more interested
<br>
in what they have to say and what they are trying to communicate is of a
<br>
fairly high complexity.

</em><br>
<p>Yes to the first part, no to the second.  In Baddeley's conceptualization of
<br>
short-term memory he did divide it into two short-term stores, the
<br>
phonological loop and the visuospatial workspace, which are both under the
<br>
control of the central executive.  Later expansions of this model allow for
<br>
short-term memory stores in other sensory and motor modalities.  Thus one
<br>
part of short-term memory, the phonological loop, is involved in auditory
<br>
acts and perception, namely speaking and listening.  But unless the problem
<br>
solving that is going on is mainly linguistic or auditory this short-term
<br>
memory store is not that used.  For example that Einstein guy did a lot of
<br>
visual imaging thus he probably used his visuospatial working memory and not
<br>
his phonological loop - thus his communication problems (he wasn't a great
<br>
writer) probably come from a visual orientation rather than verbal
<br>
orientation thus his verbal skills are neglected rather than being
<br>
interfered with by his problem solving.
<br>
<p>Anyways some &quot;genius&quot; type individuals tend not to be great verbally, but
<br>
that is usually because they develop other skills to the neglect of verbal
<br>
ones.  Sometimes that development of non-verbal skills happens because they
<br>
might actually have a verbal deficit of some type - a compensatory
<br>
development of non-verbal skills instead of just a neglect of verbal skills.
