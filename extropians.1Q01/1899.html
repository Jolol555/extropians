<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; How about a rocket that you can carry around and set on the ground,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rocket that weighs less than fifty pounds.  It would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-contained levelling stand so it could point in the good direction
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; launch vesicle, and power itself from the via ramscoop once it hit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; velocity.  You would have to stand fifty or a hundred meters away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Alternate approach: give it wings sufficient to take off from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; commercial airport.  Much easier integration into existing aerospace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infrastructure that way, even if the wings aren't that useful once in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; orbit.  Even non-fusion-powered plasma might be doable to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; orbit, since you'd only have to supply a few minutes of power from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; batteries or capacitors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The challenge here would be making the engine light but powerful enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to deliver &gt; 1 G of thrust.  Existing similar engines are designed for,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at most, .05 G, though that's mainly because they're envisioned only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for use after launch, for hours or days of constant thrust, with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; onboard power plant which would be inordinately heavy if providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power for 1 G.  I suspect one could get some useful economies of scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as the engine gets more powerful; at worst, though, if one engine gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; X newtons of thrust above what it needs to thrust itself (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power source, reaction mass, and structure to hold the engine) at 1 G
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (or whatever launch acceleration is desired) for the launch period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (that is, however long it takes to achieve orbital velocity), and one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needs Y newtons of thrust to give the same acceleration over the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; period to the rest of the rocket, then one simply needs to mount Y/X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was thinking along these lines as well.  For example, it could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multi-stage rocket or missile, with the lift stage components used as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction mass as its functional apparatus is outmoded.  So, the booster to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low orbit could direction the launch stage component towards the planet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only practical application of this I have is making those cardboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rockets with the chemical engines with electric starters, for examples the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Estes rocket, that launch and have a parachute or glider to return the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nacelle and body to Earth.
</em><br>
<p>My application: single stage spaceplane, to get people and cargoes to
<br>
orbit and back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This might be at a technology level different than ours.
</em><br>
<p>If it were, then we would never use it.  I'd rather make it with our
<br>
technology level - pushing said level if necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then after that, maybe, you could have a PC terminal that you could tell to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow you and it would float through the air carrying your other stuff.
</em><br>
<p>NASA's already making personal satellites for just this application.
<br>
They might be able to have them on the space station within a decade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If this launcher could recharge in orbit (electricity via solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; panels, and reaction mass via ramscoop - though this latter one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be too slow for practical use), it could launch with just enough power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to get to orbit plus maneuvering, then at the end of its mission,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reverse thrust and drop to near 0 velocity relative to Earth, dropping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; back into the atmosphere without resorting to aerobraking (and thus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without needing the thermal protection that aerobraking to remove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; orbital velocity requires) except to bleed off the last few hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kmph once it gets to its landing area (just like airplanes do).  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; again, it might be better just to launch it with enough charge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reaction mass to get to orbit and return, thus allowing mission abort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at any time (better known as &quot;safety margin&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There could be wings of sufficiently tensile material that could deploy at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of aerobraking.  There could be ornithopters with quite complex and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liquid surfaces.  Some designs of planes that use canards and other exotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancements, not to mention vectored thrust, are highly manueverable, but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a bird, that is small enough that it could have complex and very close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogs of the actual bird's structure.  What that leads to is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of systems that model organic behavior accurately.
</em><br>
<p>True, true.  But *there* we're getting far beyond our current tech
<br>
level, such that we'd have to push it quite a ways.  Plasma engines, on
<br>
the other hand, are tried and tested technology, just not tested at
<br>
very high power yet.  Using what already exists is cheaper - and at the
<br>
moment, access to space happens to be very expensive; one must get that
<br>
to be *much* cheaper before one can stop worrying about cost of space
<br>
access.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that's one place where computer simulation offers a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity.  For example, if we wrote just now as we did, and the program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gave us the design to build it, then we have built a good program.
</em><br>
<p>But how can you know if a newly developed simulation's not overlooking
<br>
some critical aspect of reality before you actually do what is
<br>
simulated?
