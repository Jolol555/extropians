<p>Actually, today is the first time I've posted here, although I've been on and off the list
<br>
over the last few years. I'm definitely not a green (I actually don't believe in party
<br>
affiliations; it's too limiting), although I did vote for Nader in the last presidential
<br>
election (but not because he ran on the green ticket).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They are invariably anti-capital, and blame all of society's ills on
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; same sort of excuses they use to apologize for the USSR: government is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a tool that has been corrupted by corporations because it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structured to protect the rich, etc. etc etc.
</em><br>
<p>I would be interested to know if your sampling from these groups is scientific or
<br>
anecdotal, because this seems like a simplification. Of course, it's common for people
<br>
from all political persuasions to lack the critical thinking skills necessary to make
<br>
sound judgments about  issues that push emotional buttons in them. But I would be no more
<br>
willing to accept the position that ALL of anything this complex can be attributed to
<br>
corporations than I would be to entirely blame government. Just because there are people
<br>
in the greens who only see things in black and white doesn't weaken the argument that some
<br>
corporations are responsible for some ills (this seems more reasonable and likely to me).
<br>
I am confused by your statment that &quot;they refuse to see government as the problem,&quot; since
<br>
it is unlikely that government is THE problem any more than it is that corporations are
<br>
THE problem. Certainly it's more likely a confluence of culprits, many of whom are not
<br>
acting out of greed or evil, but are simply misinformed or ignorant (although there are
<br>
glaring exceptions).
<br>
<p>As for the last sentence quoted above, I believe there is plenty of actual evidence that
<br>
the US government (at least) has pretty much been bought and paid for by powerful (i.e.,
<br>
rich) interests. This has been par for the course throughout the history of this country,
<br>
and the recent presidential coup is only one more example of it. Why exactly does
<br>
accepting this interpretation somehow conflict with your libertarian position? Why is a
<br>
large, powerful collective that calls itself a corporation better than a large, powerful
<br>
collective that calls itself a government? I mean, who's watching the watchers here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is only an ideal in that despots and demagogues have warped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political landscape so much that we think the current state is 'the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; norm', that the middle of the current political landscape is 'centrist'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its not.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you on this, but it seems likely I would probably attribute it to a different
<br>
set of interpretations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If your statement is true, then why do the people in every other culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invariably want the sort of society we have? They want 4 door cars, PCs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet access, good neighborhoods and schools, honest elections, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of the other features of the America that isn't marred by big city
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare state problems.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying my statement is true. I'm just asking that we allow for the possibility
<br>
that not everyone values what we value, even though many do. There is a rich body of
<br>
anthropological evidence that suggests that imposing our values on other cultures has
<br>
been, in many (but not all) cases, a negative process. I believe they used to call this
<br>
imperialism. ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I agree with you on this one because it can be traced to our biology. This applies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most animals in varying degrees.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you should accept the previous one as well. Animals always want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the greatest benefit for the least investment possible, and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage in pecking order behaviors.
</em><br>
<p>I can't accept your line of reasoning here, but would defend to the death your right to
<br>
say it. Something we humans have going for us that appears to be lacking in most of the
<br>
other animals (as far as we can tell) is this nifty little thing called culture, which
<br>
provides us with such potentially elevating concepts as ethics, morality, altruism and
<br>
cooperation (among so many others). Self preservation is still there underneath it all, of
<br>
course, but we now have thousands of years worth of conceptual tools that help us to think
<br>
about our actions and their consequences.
