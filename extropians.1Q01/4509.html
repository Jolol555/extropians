</em><br>
<p>If you look carefully at my original response to Brian, you'll see that I
<br>
didn't criticize him for identifying with a particular side. I simply asked
<br>
him to define his terms, and asked him why he was so interested in taking
<br>
sides. As I have said over and over again in this forum, I see knee-jerk
<br>
side-taking as more of a problem than taking a particular side. This is a
<br>
subtle distinction, I will admit, but an important one. As long as we continue
<br>
to automatically take one side or another, to see side-taking as an important
<br>
thing to do, we'll never get anywhere. This is the main problem with partisan
<br>
politics. Everyone's so busy taking sides, defining positions, and then
<br>
defending them to the death, that no actual problem solving or forward
<br>
progress is possible.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Just because you give lip service to the idea of partisan

</em><br>
<p>I've never once expressed offense because someone has taken a jab at the left.
<br>
My problem is with the act of replacing critical thinking with simplistic
<br>
jabbing. Again, this isn't side taking. It is critiquing what I see as useless
<br>
methodologies.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Actually, if you had read Brian's post carefully, you would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticed that he didn't claim to be on one side or the other.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply said that &quot;the other side&quot; was getting a taste of their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medicine.  He could easily have been referring to the other side of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heston's affiliation, but your own simplistic thinking didn't give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian the benefit of the doubt, you just pounced.
</em><br>
<p>I never claimed he was taking sides. As I said above, I was merely asking him
<br>
to define his terms, and was questioning his need to see things in
<br>
oppositional, side-taking terms. There is a difference between simplistic
<br>
thinking (side-taking) and subtle thinking (questioning the need to take
<br>
sides). Oh, and asking someone to clarify what he has said in a public forum
<br>
is not pouncing. It's a legitimate response.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If you reject tired old thinking, then how can you see what happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Florida as anything but a power struggle between two political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parties using every legal means they each had at their disposal.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggle was initiated by the Democrats because they were behind in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the count, then it was finished by the Republicans, because they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the highest trump card to play.
</em><br>
<p>I've never once disagreed with this position. I have equal disdain for the
<br>
machinations of the Democrats.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; To say that &quot;we have no president&quot; is an indicator that you bought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into every single scrap of Democratic thought that came out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole affair.
</em><br>
<p>Not true. It simply indicates that I thought Bush was handed the presidency
<br>
unfairly. If Gore had won by the same or similar tactics, I would have made
<br>
the same comment. My problem is and will continue to be the fact that we, the
<br>
American people, have been screwed, they did it blatantly, and very few people
<br>
seem to care about it. I am not a supporter of Gore or the Democratic party,
<br>
and thought he handled himself poorly. If you see this as me being partisan, I
<br>
guess there's nothing I can do about it. You obviously have a different
<br>
definition of the term.
