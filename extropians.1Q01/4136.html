<em>&gt; Goofing partially aside, if a term isnt widely known, it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be discarded.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid I have to disagree, Spike. (with this and the pygmies in space
<br>
thing, but that's another subject)  I think that developing and keeping in
<br>
use words which describe a concept for which there are no other words is a
<br>
very important cause.  The richness of English comes from its wide variety
<br>
of words, with their subtle flavors and colors, and the ability of English
<br>
speakers to generate new words to describe new things.  One of the rare
<br>
compliments my German friends give English is that it is very expressive and
<br>
subtle, which is also one of the only things about the language they find
<br>
hard to learn.  Instead of discarding words, let's work on using them more
<br>
often, in a rich context which gives clues to their meanings.  &quot;Orthogonal&quot;
<br>
has a different meaning than &quot;superfluous,&quot; or &quot;extraneous,&quot; or even
<br>
&quot;off-topic.&quot;  It's a wonderful word, and I think its worthy of use and
<br>
preservation.
<br>
<p>I hope I don't sound like one of Steven Pinker's &quot;Language Mavens,&quot;
<br>
protecting our hallowed language against Newspeak, but I do believe that an
<br>
expressive, subtle language is useful for converting thought to
<br>
communication to thought again.
