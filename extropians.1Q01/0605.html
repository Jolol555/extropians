<br>
<p>Subject:    I want my money back
<br>
<p><p>2 months ago I a 24-Hour Fitness Personal Trainer recommended some vitamin
<br>
supplements to me.
<br>
<p>A week later I signed a CONTRACT for 18 sessions with a FITNESS TRAINER at a
<br>
cost of more than a thousand dollars.
<br>
<p>I was unemployed and about $19,000 in debt at the time.  I charged it to my
<br>
Wells-Fargo Mastercard.
<br>
<p>Now I'm over $20,000 in debt.  I wish I was better at managing money.
<br>
<p>Due to circumstances beyond my control, I didn't really make much use of the
<br>
contract, and would like the money refunded.
<br>
<p>I've done my best to document the events surrounding my latest manic episode
<br>
and the following conflicts with authorities.
<br>
<p>What began as a short memo evolved into a sort of narrative.
<br>
<p>I recorded it to cdrom and have shipped copies to the concerned parties and
<br>
others who I believed would be supportive of my position.
<br>
<p>With the US Postal Service raising postage rates again, who knows if the
<br>
cd's will ever reach their target audience?
<br>
<p>In any case, attached this this note is the unformatted plain text from the
<br>
Letter to 24 Hour Fitness Management.
<br>
<p>On the CD, the document is formatted in Adobe Acrobat and there's also a
<br>
version in Microsoft Word.
<br>
<p>There are a few mistakes and some potholes and bumps in the road, and a wee
<br>
bit repetitive.
<br>
<p>I did my best to proof it, but haven't yet checked all the facts.
<br>
<p>There's always room for improvement.
<br>
<p>I'll surely make more changes.
<br>
<p>It's a work in progress.
<br>
<p>Printed it anyway.
<br>
<p>I'm in therapy.
<br>
<p>Ultra cool.
<br>
<p>Copy.
<br>
<p>we.
<br>
<p>i.
<br>
<p>.
