<p>Well Ill be damned.  Altho this wasnt the name I was thinking,
<br>
it is a better answer than mine, so I will call and end to it.  Eliezer,
<br>
<p>you are too good at this.
<br>
<p>I was looking for an invention that contained and immortalized
<br>
the name of the inventor.  Really good examples of this would be
<br>
Bunsen burner, Dewar, Biro, Diesel, Rubik's cube, Crapper, Pasteur,
<br>
annnnnndddd...
<br>
<p>the one I was thinking is below:
<br>

<br>
Saxophone.
<br>
<p>Inventor: Adolph Sax, Paris, 1842.
<br>
<p>1)  This item is an invention that did more to immortalize
<br>
the name of the inventor than any other invention I can
<br>
think of, for he named it after himself.
<br>
<p>2)  The inventor is long dead, natural causes. (Died in 1894)
<br>
<p>3)  Many people have used this item, some do so on
<br>
a regular basis.  (Including such notables as the previous U.S.
<br>
president
<br>
and Fed Chair Alan Greenspan.  I use one on a more
<br>
or less regular basis still.)
<br>
<p>4)  If shown this item, nearly everyone knows its name, whether
<br>
they have ever used one or not.  Every single person reading this
<br>
list could correctly name the item within two seconds of seeing
<br>
one.  There is no alternate name for this item. (Wouldnt you
<br>
know the name of it if you saw it?)
<br>
<p>5)  The inventor is not American.  (French, born in Belgium in 1814).
<br>
<p>6) The item is well known all over the world, better known in
<br>
some places than others I suppose.  (Some places might not
<br>
have a sax anywhere.)
<br>
<p>7)  The name is not a brand name: all brands of this item
<br>
are still called by one name.
<br>
<p>8)  Altho this item has been around for some time, it
<br>
has changed little since it was invented. (I have played
<br>
a replica of Sax's original.  Pretty close to today's
<br>
instrument.)
<br>
<p>Congrats Eliezer, for the best answer to the puzzle.  {8-]  spike
