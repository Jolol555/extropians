<p>If you don't understand how hitting someone in the face with a 
<br>
physical object (a pie) isn't a physical attack, I guess the rest of 
<br>
this discussion is pointless.
<br>
<p>Here's a thought - why not make the pie out of feces?
<br>
<p>If you can't separate a person's dignity from his face when you're 
<br>
looking at how to attack that dignity, that doesn't give you the 
<br>
right to go for both.  Your ends don't justify your means.
<br>
<p>I'm sorry, but as long as I'm minding my own business, you as a 
<br>
private citizen have no right to touch me, hit me, hug me, push me, 
<br>
or beat me - without my consent.  It's that simple.
<br>
<p>Regards,
