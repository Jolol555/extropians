<p>Hang on Al, James presented a well written and accurate response here, what 
<br>
exactly about it has gotten your goat up?
<br>
<p>To follow on from James' point, the company I work for has spent a fortune 
<br>
ensuring there is little/no impact to the local environment, and 
<br>
recycling/reuse philosophies are very prevalent.  They also encourage 
<br>
active participation by employees in their local communities.

&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
