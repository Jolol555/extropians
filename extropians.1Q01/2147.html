<p>Mike,
<br>
<p>Even in England, I find this astounding, this bit about
<br>
martial arts training there.
<br>
<p>The gun and knife situation is dire indeed.  A lot's changed
<br>
in the last decade alone.  Prior to my having left London
<br>
8 years ago, I had for the latter part of my 3-year stint
<br>
there been a member of the Imperial College non-staff shooting
<br>
club.  That would not be possible now.
<br>
<p>Non-firearms martial arts in England have not been banned
<br>
outright, to my knowledge.  The art I practice (outside of
<br>
&quot;gun-do&quot;), bujinkan budo taijutsu, has some of its most
<br>
serious and well-respected students in England; Southampton
<br>
U. has an active training group that I know of; see:
<br>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~budo/">http://www.soton.ac.uk/~budo/</a>&quot;
<br>
<p>You can ask questions about carriage of knives and such
<br>
here:
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://pub18.ezboard.com/bunofficialbujinkanukboard">http://pub18.ezboard.com/bunofficialbujinkanukboard</a>&quot;
<br>
<p>Oh, and I just found the jewel:
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://www.wpo.de/school.html#United">http://www.wpo.de/school.html#United</a> Kingdom&quot;
<br>
That lists Peter King's dojo in South Croyden.  I really wish
<br>
I'd known about the Bujinkan when I lived in London: he's one of
<br>
the most respected teachers in the art.  I know: I lived
<br>
and trained a year in Tokyo until recently, and even the
<br>
Japanese talk of him very respectfully.
<br>
<p>Peter King
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Regardless of the dread stories of being prejudiced against
<br>
if you have to defend yourself with training you've
<br>
acquired, train anyway.  Better to have it if you need it.
<br>
<p>I notice that two of you in this thread are Italian.
<br>
I'm not personally familiar with any Italian teachers
<br>
by name, but I was impressed with the fighting spirit
<br>
of the Italian visitor students I met last year
<br>
in Japan; maybe you can start by checking here:

<br>
<p><em>&gt;As in the ancient chinese story, where the penalies for being late for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work and for revolt were both death, all this means is that you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carry whatever you want, don't get caught, and don't report any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instances of defending yourself. Put your assailant down, get away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the scene, destroy your weapons and all clothes you wore at the scene
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(including shoes), change your haircut and shaving pattern, and buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself an alibi from a trustworthy friend or two.
