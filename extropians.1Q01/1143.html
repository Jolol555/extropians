<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to post my position on this recent spiralling thread/threads about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremism, guns, and gun control/revoking, whether guns are okay to talk 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about, recently whether self defense is extropic, etc. i don't know anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about guns. i've never owned a gun. i really don't know whether they're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neccesary, or if that's a valid question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having said that, i do have some thoughts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this list is normally very polite, very intelligent. i can think of very few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people on this list that haven't posted something very intelligent and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thoughtful, that i've taken to heart, or revised for my own use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i asked a question about guns on this list, i admit. and in retrospect, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the debate going on, i likely should have done that offlist, just out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respect to the &quot;non-combatants&quot; as it were. but i wanted to get a range of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's a little surprising to me that some of the attacks that have occured, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did. both pro, and anti gun advocates have made rather ugly statements, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which saddens me a bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i really dont' know which side i fall in, or if either position is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particularly valid. it's interesting that a &quot;bigger&quot; issue like nanotech 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weaponry, the pros, cons, ability of individuals to control it, etc, is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;readily accepted because nanotech is automatically &gt;H, no matter what it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use. in my view, weapon technology is weapon technology, whether nanoscale, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or macroengineering. if that's to be banned, that sounds fine, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unneccesarily repressive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Max sent an email to the point that guns as tools or meta discussion of guns 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not extropic and not relevant to the list. i would disagree, but i 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respect his position. this list is high volume as it is, and we should make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an effort to constrict it's topics to provide higher utility to it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;members, as well as avoid unneccesary conflict. on the other hand, i look at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this list as something of a society of friends. i asked the question 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;innocently, actually hoping that some of the people who had disagreed with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the use of guns would reply, with arguments as to why i, as a undecided 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voter, as it were, should not associate or train with firearms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a &quot;hopefully&quot; society of friends, associated by a transhuman interest, i 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will try to treat you guys/and gals, like i treat my friends. and when there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a problem between my friends, we think that there are really only two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choices,  not to bring up the subject, and be polite, or be a little more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aware, and work it out, finding rules and obeying them, or even just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agreeing to disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so can we come to some to some sort of consensus as to what to do about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this? i dislike unreflective conflict.
</em><br>

Discussing firearms on this list ludditic and is anachronistic.  They are basically metallically comprised chemical reaction/detonation powered slingshots, and most of the technology is hundreds of years old (even full auto has been around for more than half a century).  In the not-too-far future, the wielders of such weapons will be viewed by most laser or nano-packing futurists about the same way we presently view troglodytes with clubs.  I fail to see how adolescently fawning, reveling and jean-creaming over one contemporary model or other of such crude and unsophisticated slingshots does anything to advance extropian causes or accelerate the members of this list on the posthuman path.
