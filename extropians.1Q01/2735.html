</em><br>
<p>Of course he got raked over the coals by the knee-jerk libertarians here,
<br>
but Denis makes a good point.  Given that you are going to have laws
<br>
at all (whether privately enforced, public, negotiated or whatever),
<br>
it makes sense that uniform and consistent application is preferable to
<br>
haphazard and random enforcement.  One of the great advances of Western
<br>
society was the move towards the &quot;rule of law&quot; rather than the &quot;rule
<br>
of men&quot;.  Removing the element of capriciousness from law enforcement
<br>
makes it easier for everyone to make decisions.
<br>
<p>Imagine that other aspects of life, such as contracts for employment,
<br>
were enforced in the same random way that most laws are today.  There's a
<br>
certain chance you won't get paid at all, another chance that you'll
<br>
get paid what you should, a different chance that you'll be paid twice
<br>
as much, and so on.  Would anyone argue that such a system is superior
<br>
to one where you have consistent and reliable expectations about the
<br>
outcomes of your actions?
<br>
<p>I understand the fear that greater consistency of law enforcement will
<br>
automatically lead to a more restrictive society.  But this assumes that
<br>
society does not already have the degree of restrictiveness that people
<br>
desire on the average.  If that were true, people would already have
<br>
increased penalties and/or spent more money on law enforcement.  The fact
<br>
that society is (roughly) in a steady state on these issues indicates that
<br>
the degree of restrictiveness is approximately what is already desired.
<br>
With more effective law enforcement tools, Denis is entirely correct
<br>
that we should expect the laws to be relaxed correspondingly.
<br>
<p>If you want to gamble, go to the casinos.  But in your legal relationships
<br>
with society, predictability and reliability is preferable.
