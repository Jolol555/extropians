</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>You watch too much TV/movies.  The same applies to the U.S.  Most police
<br>
officers will go an entire career without having to shoot anyone.  As for
<br>
police corruption, it is like politician corruption -- it happens
<br>
everywhere.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In particular, your argument about someone protecting themselves with a gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the police &quot;raid his house with a swat team&quot; is, well, far off. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think your swat teams are expert enough that no one will survive shooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back against them. 
</em><br>
<p><p>But what do you know?  You clearly don't have the experience to make such a
<br>
determination of possibility regarding these things -- perhaps you should
<br>
leave such determinations to people that do.  What you believe may seem
<br>
true in principle, but in practice there have been many times where
<br>
individuals with guns *have* successfully fended off a police raid and
<br>
lived to tell about it.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If they want to shoot you, they can do it anyway -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretending a gun provides any real protection against the police is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion. The only thing you might be able to do with it is kill a few good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police officers before they put a bullet in your head for doing so.
</em><br>
<p><p>If they are kicking in your door for reasons that make one's shooting at
<br>
them a defensible action, then I would question just how &quot;good&quot; those
<br>
officers were that you killed.  After all, if they were willing to kick in
<br>
your door and shoot you on whatever illegal basis, then they don't meet
<br>
my definition of &quot;good&quot;.  In the long run, justice is better served if a
<br>
few officers take a bullet for doing something patently illegal/stupid
<br>
that has the strong potential for killing another human being.
