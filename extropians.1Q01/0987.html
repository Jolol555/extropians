Well I do confess to a perhaps inordinate fondness for
<br>
James Cameron epics--but &quot;friendly&quot; is of course a
<br>
human concept which, arguably, is not logic-based--or
<br>
wouldn't be for an entity not dependent upon friends
<br>
for its own well-being.
<br>
<p>I present the following scenario: AI programmed to be
<br>
friendly and oversee humanity, exterminating pesky
<br>
aggressors. Something goes wrong with AI. Humans try
<br>
to shut it down to avoid catastrophe. AI perceives
<br>
this as aggression (after all, why would we want to
<br>
harm Mr. Friendly..?), and so on...
<br>
<p>Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?
<br>
HAL was unarmed.

<em>&gt; &gt; Okay, call me self-aggrandizing, but this has for

<em>&gt; &gt; Marlow's Paradox:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; “We cannot entrust our fate to machines without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emotions, for they have no compassion; we cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entrust our fate to machines with emotions, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are unpredictable.”
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A Friendly AI is neither emotional nor unemotional. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anything purely logical would exterminate us as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unpredictable and dangerous. Anything emotional is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; itself unpredictable and dangerous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You, sir, have been watching too much Hollywood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive science.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to exterminate unpredictable and dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things is itself an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is nothing inconsistent about the idea of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'logical' (intelligent)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity whose goal is to be Friendly.  (Why isn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfish?  Because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfishness is an evolved attribute, and complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional adaptations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't just materialize in source code.  So how does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Friendliness get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the contents of cognition?  Because we put it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.  That basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inequality is what makes it all possible.)
