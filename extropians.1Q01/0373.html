Oh this is beautiful; how to make nanotechnology even
<br>
harder! I agree that such precautions could be taken.
<br>
Will they be, by all parties? Not likely. Limiting the
<br>
things in such ways will drastically reduce their
<br>
usefulness.
<br>
<p>I also agree that nanotechnological weapons MAY be the
<br>
primary threat. After all--a weapon which is not
<br>
natural-environment-capable is useless. Weapons will
<br>
be designed to disassemble ALL matter, and they will
<br>
be able to operate in ALL environments. This is why I
<br>
used weapons as an example.
<br>
<p>To be truthful, though, I really can't see how AIs
<br>
will improve things on the weapons front.

<p>The problem of not accidentally releasing a

natural-environment-capable
<br>
replicator can be solved very easily by never
<br>
designing a
<br>
natural-environment-capable replicator, and, of
<br>
course, making very very
<br>
sure that replicators don't have the capability to
<br>
mutate.  Build
<br>
replicators that incorporate yttrium and boron and can
<br>
only reproduce in
<br>
high vacuum at eighty degrees Kelvin using broadcast
<br>
power and broadcast
<br>
information, and an accidental spill won't make a
<br>
difference.  Encrypting
<br>
the reproduction information - if you have it
<br>
on-board, which is itself a
<br>
mistake - is also easy; what you'd have to watch out
<br>
for would be prions,
<br>
structural deformations that result in similar
<br>
structural deformations in
<br>
offspring.
<br>
<p>It's nanotechnological warfare, not the sheer
<br>
stupidity required for an
<br>
accidental error, that imposes the time limit on us
<br>
AIfolk.
