<em>&gt;&gt; Anyway, even if Einstein had been the greatest admirer of Velikovsky

<p><em>&gt;As I've argued earlier -- though Damien disagreed with me.  They have no

</em><br>
<p>I was trying to draw a useful distinction between `argument from authority'
<br>
of the form &lt; Aristotle believed this, so it must be true so shut your trap
<br>
<em>&gt; and &lt; Here is Einstein's view of relativistic time dilatation; you might
</em><br>
prefer to pay closer attention to this than to Donald Duck's rubber band
<br>
aether account &gt;.
<br>
<p>I feel comforted by the extra details JM has now posted concerning
<br>
Einstein's interest in Velikovsky's piffle. As for the science, AE's own
<br>
specialty: embarrassing horseshit, sez Albert. So what *did* he like in the
<br>
book? Well, that apparently inexplicable bunch of stuff about historic and
<br>
prehistoric catastrophes - a field in which Einstein was no authority at all. 
<br>
<p>But what is it leads us to suspect that he was being misled by Velikovsky's
<br>
jackdaw scrapheap pseudo-arguments? Why, in the first instance, the many
<br>
raspberries blown by experts in those fields - which, when one follows them
<br>
up, appear to be based upon abundant evidence and logic. 
<br>
<p>But--
<br>
<p>Both plate tectonics and the impact of major vulcanism and random cometary
<br>
impacts were poorly understood and usually mocked by the experts at that
<br>
time. Bearing this in mind, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that *some* of
<br>
what Einstein meant by `There is much of interest in the book which proves
<br>
that in fact catastrophes have taken place which must be attributed to
<br>
extraterrestrial causes' could ndeed now find their explanation in terms
<br>
outside those available to authorities in the mid-1950s. 
<br>
<p>In that sense, Velikovsky, like Charles Fort and von Daniken and Colin
<br>
Wilson and possibly Donald Duck, could have drawn useful attention to
<br>
disruptive anomalies in the `authoritative' geological and astrophysical
<br>
science of his time. Any value in doing so, though, was entirely vitiated
<br>
by his mad, bad pseudo-science. I would not be surprised if his big public
<br>
profile served to turn some serious attention away from any interesting
<br>
aspects of the world drawn into his zany web - just as I feel that the
<br>
authentic evidence for some classes of parapsychological phenomena [boo!
<br>
hiss! from the monkey gallery :) ] are lost from view amid the antics of
<br>
Uri Geller and his sorry like.
