Obviously the previous post was not appropriate for SL4, and I've already
<br>
spoken to the poster about that.  However, I should also like to note that
<br>
I am, in general, bored with &quot;Hey, maybe yada-dada is a transhumanist!&quot;
<br>
posts - here, and on the Extropians list, and everywhere else in the Solar
<br>
System.  I do not care whether the Beatles, Einstein, or Christopher
<br>
Columbus were transhumanists or Singularitarians or whatever.  Claiming
<br>
that [insert historical figure] was &quot;really&quot; a member of [insert speaker's
<br>
Cause] is symptomatic of a total lack of self-confidence.  It is a meme
<br>
trying to promote itself by claiming credit for someone else's work. 
<br>
Transhumanism and Singularitarianism will stand or fall on their own damn
<br>
merits, and if you want to see famous transhumanists, I suggest you become
<br>
a transhumanist and then make yourself famous.
<br>
<p>Expressing heart-warmingly vague sentiments about growth and change is a
<br>
human thing, not a transhumanist thing, and has undoubtedly been done by
<br>
every historical goodguy from Socrates to Gandhi.  It's expected, it's
<br>
natural, and it doesn't mean one damn thing.  Transhumanism in its
<br>
reified, explicit, non-heartwarmingly-vague form is a very recent
<br>
innovation, and I do not expect to find that Columbus was a closet
<br>
transhumanist any more than I expect to find that Socrates was a closet
<br>
Yankees fan.
<br>
<p>If Loreena McKennitt announces tomorrow that she's joined the Extropy
<br>
Institute, it'll be a newsworthy item; go ahead and post it.  Until then,
<br>
I don't give a flying damn *what* she thinks.  The reason I'm confident in
<br>
my ideas is that a very smart person agrees with them - *me*.  If someone
<br>
else also agrees with me, good for *them*.  I'm quite sure that everyone
<br>
on this list who was smart enough to grow up an outsider in grade school
<br>
understands exactly what I mean.  You don't have to be the smartest person
<br>
in the world to be smarter than 90% of the thoughts you come into contact
<br>
with over your lifetime, and if that's how you grow up, then caring what
<br>
Christopher Columbus thinks just isn't part of your personality.  You may
<br>
have one or two childhood heroes who you wouldn't want to hear calling you
<br>
an idiot, and you may understand the PR necessity of getting people to
<br>
agree with you, and you may even buy into the scientific peer-review
<br>
process in the abstract - but at the end of the day, the reason you
<br>
believe in your ideas is that *you* decided they were right.  You don't
<br>
really give a damn what anyone else in the solar system thinks, though you
<br>
may think you ought to.
<br>
<p>Smart Person's Iconoclasm Syndrome is one of the SL2 basics.  I expect
<br>
everyone smart enough to post on SL4 to be familiar with the ways of
<br>
iconoclasm, regardless of whether they personally consider themselves to
<br>
be proudly defiant iconoclasts, or consider iconoclasm to be an immature
<br>
juvenile stupidity that they outgrew.  I can understand a smart person who
<br>
never had Smart Person's Iconoclasm Syndrome even as a twelve-year-old,
<br>
but not a smart person who doesn't know what Smart Person's Iconoclasm
<br>
Syndrome *is*.  I myself have no great emotional investment in iconoclasm
<br>
- I don't try to monitor or control my level of iconoclasm - but an
<br>
internal scan clearly shows that, no, I still don't give a damn what other
<br>
people think.
<br>
<p>I shouldn't even have to post this.  I'm an iconoclast and I know it, but
<br>
it's been... oh, around three years, I think... since I've had to fire any
<br>
of the &quot;defiant iconoclasm&quot; neurons.  But, for the record - *yes*, Smart
<br>
Person's Iconoclasm Syndrome is one of the basics, and you are expected to
<br>
know how it works, whether or not you agree with it.
