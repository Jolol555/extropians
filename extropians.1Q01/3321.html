<br>
Uh, no I don't. I *like* living in an extremely dense city where I can
<br>
walk anywhere I need to go. However, for the sake of argument ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Earth could be a place like that, but... with 6 billion people? I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know. Can the planet sustain 6 billion individuals with high energy/space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs?
</em><br>
<p>One estimate I've seen is that the earth has roughly 49 million square
<br>
miles of inhabitable land (total surface area of 197 million square
<br>
miles). That's actually 127 million square kilometres (inhabitable)
<br>
and 510 million square kilometres (total, including sea).
<br>
<p>So. If we take six billion people and spread them evenly across the entire
<br>
planetary surface (glug, glug :) we get ten people per square kilometre,
<br>
or roughly ten hectares per person. There are 2.47 acres per hectare, so
<br>
we're talking about a roughly 25 acre plot per person -- divide by four
<br>
for the sea surface, and we still have 6 acres each of habitable land.
<br>
<p>Just one acre is a pretty damn big urban plot: where I live, it's about
<br>
one block -- with maybe eighty households living on it. So, although you
<br>
might *think* that a population density of ten people per square kilometre
<br>
everywhere is high, it's actually about three orders of magnitude lower
<br>
than a density that I find comfortable.
<br>
<p>Human cities currently tend towards population densities in the
<br>
1000-10,000 person/km^2 range, without the need for high-density vertical
<br>
accomodation (except in the more dense areas). And an increasing
<br>
proportion of the world's population lives in such cities: I believe
<br>
that we may have a situation where most people *prefer* city life.
<br>
<p>So, even given the option of a six acre plot of dry land, or 25 acres
<br>
including mostly deep ocean, I figure a large proportion (20-80%) of
<br>
the world population would prefer urban living -- albeit probably with
<br>
a bit more space and better amenities than they have today.
<br>
<p>If 50% of the population accept city life,  they end up occupying maybe
<br>
1% of the planetary surface -- leaving 11.9 dry acres of land to everybody
<br>
else, or fifty acres of ocean. This is a highly sensitive ratio: if 80%
<br>
want to live in cities (as seems the case, most places) the country-
<br>
dwellers get a farm-sized estate each.
<br>
<p>If we extrapolate in the opposite direction, at a density of 10,000 people
<br>
per square kilometre (same order as downtown Hong Kong) we have a carrying
<br>
capacity of 1.27 trillion people on Earth -- before we move into vertical 
<br>
arcologies that add at least another order of magnitude. At the trillion-
<br>
citizen point we have an increasing problem with heat dissipation: just our
<br>
metabolic functions will pump out getting on for 0.5 x 10^15 watts. If we
<br>
allow for extremely efficient nanosystems to keep us fed, clothed, housed,
<br>
and amused, we can probably stick another order of magnitude onto that --
<br>
assuming a person consumes 5Kw of power (this highly insulated northern
<br>
European household typically draws about 10-20Kw and doesn't live on a soup
<br>
of nanomachines or include food production) we have a figure of 5 x 10^15
<br>
watts.
<br>
<p>To put this in perspective, if we cover the entire land area with solar
<br>
cells that are 100% efficient, half of it is in sunlight at any time
<br>
-- so we have roughly 65 million km^2 of solar panels. Assuming 100
<br>
watts/square metre reaches ground level (a bit high, I think -- anyone
<br>
got the figures?) this gives us 6.5 x 10^15 watts of insolation. 
<br>
<p>So, with a population of 1.2 trillion people (200 times our current level)
<br>
we have just hit the buffers using solar power and a population density
<br>
no higher than a current-era highly affluent city (Hong Kong's quality of
<br>
life being not too dissimilar to that in urban Japan, in material terms).
<br>
<p>I therefore conclude that there is *no* requirement to go for massive
<br>
population reduction. The earth can carry 200 times as many people before
<br>
things get sticky enough to require us to disrupt the planetary energy
<br>
budget and deal with our own waste heat, or overcrowd ourselves relative
<br>
to current high end population densities. Even with the current population,
<br>
there's no reason why everybody who wants it can't have a generous plot of
<br>
land.
