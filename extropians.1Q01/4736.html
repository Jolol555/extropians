Here's the post from another list that I mentioned yesterday. The author,
<br>
Lynn Wigglesworth, gave me permission to repost it here. The thread was
<br>
about government/corporate partnerships and their effect on food production.
<br>
The first bit, enclosed in brackets, was posted by another list member.
<br>
<p>I expect the reflex reaction from some Extropians will be to accuse me of
<br>
being a Luddite when I say I'm in favor of low-input farming. Please
<br>
understand I'm not advocating going backwards to the way things were done
<br>
150 years ago. I'm saying that, based on what I've learned so far from 51
<br>
years of being curious and poking around to see how things work, it makes
<br>
far more sense to UNDERSTAND natural processes and work with them to the
<br>
extent possible rather than to use brute force without understanding what
<br>
one is doing. In terms of dollars, why spend $2000 for something when you
<br>
could get the same, or better, for 50 cents?

<p>=========================================
<br>
<p>[&gt;It is not difficult to foresee full taxpayer subsidization of
<br>
<em>&gt;farms owned by ADM, Cargill, Monsanto, ad nauseum, perhaps set up as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;utilities have been, monopolies to ensure profit, eminent domain used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create mega-farms.]
</em><br>
<p>I do see change happening in agriculture. Small farms are making a
<br>
comeback.  They aren't pretty, don't have hired hands, and don't have a lot
<br>
of fancy machinery. But they are successful. You don't hear a lot about
<br>
these people because they are tucked away on backroads. They are too busy
<br>
making a living and optimistic to be out complaining about how bad farming
<br>
is. There are a lot of Joel Salatin types that aren't as vocal. I know a
<br>
good number of people like this...our spring grazing conference is
<br>
expecting 200 (mostly dairy) farmers with this mindset (even if they aren't
<br>
doing it yet) from a 2-county area. That's almost enough to start a
<br>
movement, except these types aren't 'joiners' (a friend says that
<br>
coordinating farmers is like trying to move frogs in a wheelbarrow).
<br>
<p>Even we, with our 10 scruffy milk cows, are probably making more money
<br>
(ACTUAL $ PROFIT) than the 1000 cow dairies in Ca. Not much in the winter
<br>
with all purchased feed (but at least we don't lose money), but during
<br>
grazing season, it's almost no cost and all profit (obviously our next goal
<br>
is to extend the grazing season as much as possible). The big dairies
<br>
publish their numbers in places like Hoards...many of them LOSE money month
<br>
after month. They have loans on top of loans. We can wait them out. The
<br>
future is about low input farming, not more chemicals and bigger tractors.
<br>
Low-input farming is sustainable and profitable. I see it happening in
<br>
Pennsylvania and New York. I am encouraged.
