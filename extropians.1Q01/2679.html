<p>On the one hand, it's hard to justify objecting to it within the
<br>
framework of the existing law.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if you think the law is *wrong* it's, um, repressive
<br>
to say the least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is like developing an immunisation jab that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pot have no effect on people,
</em><br>
<p>This would be disastrous; you're trying to mess around with a neurotransmitter
<br>
analog! If you get it wrong, you'll make people immune to a chunk of their
<br>
central nervous system. Not good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or an added ingredient to beer that stops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people getting drunk,
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with getting drunk in private? Getting drunk is not, I stress
<br>
this, illegal: it's only an offense to be a nuisance in public, or operate
<br>
certain types of machinery while under the influence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or a car that refuses to drive with a drunk driver,
</em><br>
<p>Harder to oppose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; etc. Is it likely in future that there will be far fewer people in prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because more &quot;crimes&quot; will become impossible to commit?
</em><br>
<p>There're some more possibilities you forgot, if you follow this line of
<br>
reasoning. Fit all pre-17 year olds with chastity belts because sex before
<br>
17 violates the age of consent. Strip-search people every week to look for
<br>
suspicious signs that they've been engaging in sadomasochistic sexual
<br>
activities that cause physical damage. Ban use of any computer software
<br>
that doesn't have a commercial license and a commercial source of origin,
<br>
and regularly audit machines to look for illegal content or unlicensed
<br>
software. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We're doing it to protect you&quot; is by far the most insidious excuse for 
<br>
grotesque totalitarian abuses of civil liberties.  And with Jack Straw
<br>
running the Home Office, you actually want to *support* this tendency?
