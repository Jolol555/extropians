<p><em>&gt; INDUSTRY MEETS ENVIRONMENT IN NEW INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  A community of researchers, policy makers, industrial strategists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and environmental advocates announces the launch of the International
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Society of Industrial Ecology. The new field of industrial ecology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  applies ecological concepts to the organization and operation of industry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The tools of industrial ecology include eco-design, eco-industrial parks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  material and energy flow studies, life cycle assessment (LCA) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  organizational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  design.
</em><br>
<p>These are very appealing goals to me.  Fifteen years ago, when I began 
<br>
working in the &quot;independent power&quot; industry, it was known as the &quot;cogen&quot; 
<br>
business, an abbreviation of &quot;cogeneration&quot;, or the idea of building power 
<br>
plants which fit into existing industrial processes with minimal waste.  The 
<br>
most elaborate of these plants I worked on at that time used gas turbines to 
<br>
directly generate electricity via a drive shaft connected to the turbine 
<br>
shaft.  Hot exhaust gasses from the turbine were routed through a boiler, 
<br>
which created steam.  Some of this high-pressure steam was routed to the host 
<br>
industrial plant to be used as &quot;process steam&quot; in some chemical process (I 
<br>
never knew what that was).  That water was returned to the cogen plant after 
<br>
its heat had been extracted.  The rest of the high-pressure steam drove 
<br>
another turbine that was connected to an electrical generator.  The low 
<br>
pressure steam exiting from the steam turbine was &quot;busted&quot; in a cooling tower 
<br>
and re-routed back to the gas turbine exhaust gas boilers.
<br>
<p>This plant was basically designed in 1983 and also included what at the time 
<br>
was a cutting edge idea: Distributed digital control.  Each of the plant's 
<br>
components had its own computer, which communicated over a &quot;data highway&quot; (as 
<br>
it was called) LAN with all the other components, so that the balance among 
<br>
the input and output of all the individual pieces could be worked out on a 
<br>
distributed and emergent basis.  It was also designed to be able to grow, so 
<br>
that the original five gas turbines could be increased later.  Today there 
<br>
are eight gas turbines in that plant.
<br>
<p>All of this was a real visionary move toward the concept of organic 
<br>
industrial ecology.  (Yes - this was the group that ended up being the power 
<br>
subsidiary of Dynegy, that much-vilified &quot;greedy profiteer&quot; that now figures 
<br>
as the chief villain in the lawsuits that have been filed by various 
<br>
Californian People's Commissars.  Interestingly, that company that was known 
<br>
in 1983 as Power Systems Engineering was primarily created as the vision of a 
<br>
single man, Al Smith, who could be a character out of Atlas Shrugged and is 
<br>
one of my personal heroes.  Al also happened to be a great believer in the 
<br>
profitable power of diversity and groomed and promoted a number of brilliant 
<br>
women and African Americans in his organization.)  
<br>
<p>As it turned out, these kinds of true cogen plants aren't being made any more 
<br>
(although &quot;combined cycle&quot; power plants, that at least use the gas turbine 
<br>
waste heat to make steam for additional electrical generation, are still 
<br>
occasionally being built).  Folded up inside the tortuous history of 
<br>
cogeneration and independent power are some interesting lessons about how 
<br>
government works well and poorly in connection with economic and industrial 
<br>
policy.  The heyday of cogeneration was fostered by some hellishly complex 
<br>
federal legislation that granted tax incentives to industrial companies that 
<br>
undertook these generation facilities in association with existing plants.  
<br>
This legislation was necessary because electrical power generation was at the 
<br>
time the sole preserve of monopolies granted by state and local governments.  
<br>
The federal cogen laws were a clever creature of Carter-era energy policies 
<br>
that sought to encourage more efficient use of hydrocarbon-fueled electrical 
<br>
generation.  With the fall of gas prices in the '80s, this kind of subsidy 
<br>
wasn't seen as necessary any more and was discontinued.  Fortunately, though, 
<br>
the cat was out of the bag and companies like Dynegy and Enron were able to 
<br>
continue the assault on local power monopolies that has resulted in the 
<br>
beginnings of power deregulation we see today - with mixed results.
<br>
<p>All of which leads to the question of how the kinds of &quot;industrial ecology&quot; 
<br>
values promoted by the group mentioned in Barbara's post can be fostered in 
<br>
the current political and economic environment.  As regular readers of this 
<br>
list will know, I don't need to establish my libertarian or free market 
<br>
credentials.  On the other hand, I do have a nostalgia for the fiendishly 
<br>
clever interconnectedness of the kind of cogen plants we were building in the 
<br>
early and mid-80s under the Carter laws.  There is no doubt that the current 
<br>
state of simple market factors aren't creating incentives for this kind of 
<br>
design and construction now; take my word for it.  Energy prices don't 
<br>
support the extra effort they require.  Presumably, rising energy prices WILL 
<br>
cause such efforts to be undertaken again in the future.  On the other hand, 
<br>
significant advances in photovoltaics and power storage will also make them 
<br>
unnecessary.  
<br>
<p>I'd be curious to see a discussion here about how free market forces can be 
<br>
harnessed to encourage closing industrial cycles more efficiently and cleanly.
