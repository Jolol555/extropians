<p><em>&gt; &gt;  Maybe there's more, but I think this would do it very well. I would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  see what happens if everyone, with no work required and no compensation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  expected, could be granted all of the above benefits, by means of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  self-maintaining technology. I speculate the world would be a better place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We used to talk about this a lot - but the subject hasn't come up lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The basic concept held by some is that a very sophisticated nanotech-enabled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy would be so rich that &quot;the basics&quot; as you describe them could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided to people at such low cost that they would be essentially free.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some have speculated, &quot;free basics&quot; might come with some strings attached,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as built-in advertising, or as a give-away in connection with some other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods or services.  Beyond this, a sufficiently wealthy and technologically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced civilization might be able to afford universal &quot;free basics&quot; as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter of charity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I find this idea very appealing also.  Especially if you throw in all
<br>
the computing power you could want and full access to information. Then
<br>
people like me who have some strange scheme they want to work on but
<br>
can't find a backer need not worry about starving or becoming homeless
<br>
while developing it.  It could be very liberating.  
<br>
<p>On the other hand I think that some 90% of the population would go into
<br>
ultimate couch potato land, breed like rabbits and spend the rest of
<br>
their time killing one another and doing other basic hominid madness. 
<br>
Many people claim and believe that they only reason to work is because
<br>
they have to.  Perhaps not having to would enable them to find things to
<br>
do that are more uplifting or interesting for their own sake.  But I
<br>
wouldn't count on it.  Now I have known a lot of techno-hippies over the
<br>
years that lived off of government checks (SSI and such) and did
<br>
wonderful fantastic works of their own design which could not have been
<br>
done in a paying job.  It would be good if everyone got the chance to do
<br>
this.
