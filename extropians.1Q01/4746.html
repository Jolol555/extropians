<br>
<p>The World Gold Council publishes a monthly list of official gold
<br>
holdings
<br>
of 112 countries and institutions. This list is mainly based on data
<br>
reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
<br>
<p>E-GOLD has 44,800 ounces in the vault, which is equal to 1.4 tonnes (at
<br>
32,151 troy ounces per metric tonne). This puts e-gold on rank #88 of
<br>
the
<br>
112 countries. It means that e-gold has already more gold than 24 of the
<br>
IMF member countries. Not bad for a young Internet company.
<br>
<p>The WGC statistics reveal some worrying aspects of the national
<br>
currencies:
<br>
<p>1. The total gold holding of the 109 countries + IMF + BIS + ECB is just
<br>
under 33,000 tonnes which is on average only 12% of the countries'
<br>
reserves. The USA reported 8,136 tonnes (56%), the Euro countries 12,427
<br>
tonnes (31%), the IMF 3,217 tonnes and Switzerland 2,419 tonnes (40%).
<br>
These four groups own 80% of the total official gold
<br>
<p>2. The statistics include gold leased out to bullion banks and
<br>
manufacturers. The physical gold owned by the central banks might be
<br>
less.
<br>
I have not yet obtained accurate statistics to determine the extent of
<br>
the
<br>
gold leasing
<br>
<p>3. Harry Schultz estimated in January 2001 that 78% of the non-gold
<br>
reserves are held in US Dollars or US Treasury bonds. This places an
<br>
extreme responsibility on Alan Greenspan to maintain the international
<br>
confidence in the dollar.
<br>
<p>4. These statistics reinforce the conclusion that the Dollar and all
<br>
national currencies are backed by someone else's liability. As long as
<br>
everyone has confidence in the system it will work. However, this week
<br>
the
<br>
Turkish Lira collapsed in value by 28%.
<br>
<p>5. Douglas Jackson's comment a few days ago about the possibility that
<br>
Bullion banks might not always have the physical gold in stock, just
<br>
highlighted the fact that most institutions have short positions in
<br>
gold.
<br>
This is very profitable while the price is falling and many institutions
<br>
would be very vulnerable in case the price would start to go up.
<br>
<p>In a new book, The Future of Money, Mr Bernard Lietaer (ex- Belgian
<br>
National Bank) makes a strong argument for commodity backed currencies
<br>
(like e-gold) and for time based community currencies (like TimeDollars
<br>
and LETS). He does not spare his criticism of fiat currencies. It is
<br>
worth
<br>
reading.
<br>
<p>The tide is changing against national currencies and e-gold, e-dinar and
<br>
GoldMoney are well placed to become major methods of payment in the
<br>
future.
