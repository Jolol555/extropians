</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm. This is an interesting issue, since in science (unlike many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fields of human endeavor) authorities often have this status granted them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by their peers not due to birth or wealth or winsomeness or force of arms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but because of track record in their fields of expertise.
</em><br>
<p>Think of stocks and bonds: a track record is no guarantee of future
<br>
performance.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Acknowledged authority thus becomes a useful shorthand, inviting us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consult one rather than another body of claim and argument. Granted, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heuristic sometimes breaks down, when the brash innovator from the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides of the track record comes up with a snazzy paradigm buster. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually not. Science mostly *is* cumulative, despite research program and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradigm discontinuities.
</em><br>
<p>The thing is the ideas, not the people.  Granted, you might trust a zaney
<br>
idea coming from someone who is usually sober -- as opposed to from your
<br>
corner drunk.  However, this is still not correct.  This is only because
<br>
you're allowing yourself to succumb to spell of authority.  (See below.)
<br>
The ideas and theories must be considered based on whether they explain the
<br>
facts (and some might argue fit with other ideas) better than others.
<br>
<p>It is not a valid argument to say, A with a PhD in chemistry says X, and if
<br>
X then Y, therefore Y.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That being the case, it makes plenty of sense to heed, by preference, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledged authorities in the first, second and third instance, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn to the unheralded self-proclaimed geniuses as a last resort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desperation (and, of course, for fun and sport).
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  I might be willing to consider ideas from such sources more readily,
<br>
but the same rules still apply.  In other words, if the corner drunk tells
<br>
me his TOE (Theory of Everything), I'm unlikely to listen long while if
<br>
Stephen Hawking tells me his, I'm likely to listen, BUT I'm not going to
<br>
think Hawking's must be true because he holds the Lucasian chair at Oxford
<br>
(the chair does not guarantee truth or wisdom), is considered a genius
<br>
(genius status does not ditto), and an expert in physics (expertise does not
<br>
ditto).  (In fact, I disagree with a lot of Stephen Hawking's ideas.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
