<em>&gt; Hey, Ive an idea.  Many will agree that a rising sea is bad for those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who live near it on low ground.  What if we were to intentionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower the sea level?  Wouldnt we recover a bunch of ground that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; would love this idea:  could we not pump sea water inland on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Antarctica and spew it into the sky on a cold dark summer day?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We would create a mountain of ice and salt that would store water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a sense.  Then we go ahead and let the earth warm up a bit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it more hospitable to those who have a lotta money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Has this idea been proposed before?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know, but this brings up an idea: What impact upon ocean sea
<br>
levels has the Russian redirecting of rivers away from the Caspian and
<br>
Aral seas done? If water flows were corrected, would this mitigate
<br>
rising sea levels?
<br>
<p>Your idea I think would likely be a bad idea, since ice in Antarctica is
<br>
pure water, not salt water, adding salt would loosen it up and cause it
<br>
to flow outward. The water can easily be accumulated in freshwater
<br>
deposits if they are built for rains to fill.
<br>
<p>The big solution is to drop an asteroid or two on the Nepal/Caspian
<br>
region, digging some huge lakebeds to fill up with water. Dredge out the
<br>
Great Lakes. Dam the Grand Canyon, Bryce canyon, and flood the Death
<br>
Valley and Dead Sea with canal tunnels from the coast, blast open an
<br>
inlet to the Great Rift Valley. Lake Baikal, for instance, could hold
<br>
twice as much water as it does if its outlet were dammed up.
<br>
<p>I just put in a post to my cousin if he has any data on the volumes of
<br>
the below sea level volumes of the three areas I listed.
