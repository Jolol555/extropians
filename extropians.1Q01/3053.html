<p>Playing Devil's Advocate here, but what's the justification?
<br>
Off-planet, you can survive if the Earth turns into grey goo.  Not so
<br>
here.  Merely preparing for off-planet has some merit, but not much:
<br>
you run into conditions that are neither at your chosen off-planet site
<br>
or in normal Earth habitation, and have to waste (from the end goal's
<br>
viewpoint) at least some of the effort you spend adapting to them.
<br>
<p>Maybe if there were some economic motivation?  Say, you find a way to
<br>
manufacture stuff, or a kind of therapy, or some mineral extraction,
<br>
that can only/best be done at the target site?  (The first and third
<br>
have to answer why human presence, and not just robot presence, is
<br>
necessary; this usually involves something that robots can not do, or
<br>
at least not do well given current tech.)
