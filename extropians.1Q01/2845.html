<em>&gt; &gt; This is a popular socialist argument.  It assumes that all of us, every

<p>Yes, and each and everyone one of them is paid the market value of their
<br>
contribution already.  So exactly why do they deserve a cut of someone
<br>
else's contribution?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;From this viewpoint, being creative and innovative is merely a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've noticed a tendency of people on this list -- and of libertarians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in general -- to flatter themselves with the idea that they belong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some tiny elite, buried in the seething masses, who actually make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things work and civlization progress. Well, it might be true -- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that might be a pig I see through my study window, on final approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into Turnhouse airport. Folks, we *are* those masses. Doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if most of them are dumb as a plank; we're still related.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually I belong to several &quot;elites&quot;.  So what?  I don't believe in of
<br>
them are utterly responsible for all progress.  I also don't believe any
<br>
of them ride on the backs of the masses unfairly and therefore owe the
<br>
masses more than they already give.  And I certainly understand my
<br>
relationship and samenesses and differences with other people.  Not of
<br>
that changes the argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I figure that if you want to set ethical goals for extropians, taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those dumb-as-a-plank people and helping them learn to *think* would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a good starting point for activism. Denying that they're *capable*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thought is actually a first step down another road -- one that leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a hereditary aristocracy or a caste system.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there is some actual evidence that beyond a certain point in life
<br>
the brain is not exactly very malleable to learning some foundational
<br>
things including formal operations.  And there is the tiny problem that
<br>
no matter how patiently you lead the horse to water that you can't force
<br>
it to drink. 
<br>
<p>Thinking is not heriditary and introducing that here is a canard. It is
<br>
a matter of training and will and basic ability.  Only a small part of
<br>
basic ability is arguably genetic.
