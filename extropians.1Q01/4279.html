<p><em>&gt; &gt; In a sense, but, pre-nanotech, the notion is that the GI

<p>Might be even worse. After a generation, people born into such a society
<br>
would not know any other way of living than being idle. Most people with
<br>
high potential would be silently discouraged by their elders as well as
<br>
peers. The result would be an idle, no-good society; no development, no
<br>
purpose, no nothing. A bunch of people living like monkeys.
<br>
<p>Or maybe it's not so gloom? There's often a very thin line between a good
<br>
solution and a bad solution. Maybe this
<br>
guaranteed-income/nano-generated-resources society can be tweaked in only a
<br>
few places to produce a society that does *not* discourage its members from
<br>
curiosity, research, and action. And that does not multiply like rabbits.
<br>
<p>Yes, I would actually be willing to say that it's all in the way it's
<br>
executed. We would simply have to experiment and find out. We already have a
<br>
few negative examples; for instance, Egypt (the whole country is 80% funded
<br>
by tourism) got it wrong. But if we are able to find or produce some
<br>
positive examples, and analyze the difference, we would be heading in a good
<br>
direction.
