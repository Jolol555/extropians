<em>&gt; &gt; The authors were writing about specifically different problems. Orwell

<em>&gt; &gt; imposed by the stratification of a consumerist society along the lines

<em>&gt; If automation eliminates the need for 90% of workers[*], then a utilitarian

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<em>&gt; [*] Note that this isn't the same as eliminating the need for 90% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     work -- workers can be redeployed and retrained, most of the time. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     question is, what do you do when 90% of your population _can't_ be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     retrained to do something useful?
</em><br>
<p>However, under the pretext of the novel, all non-Alphas were as they
<br>
were *by design*. Since automation eliminates the need for lower classes
<br>
to be made, then there is no need to intentionally produce lower class
<br>
individuals within the context of the society of the novel. This
<br>
presupposes that the society of the novel, because all people are the
<br>
way they are by design, that all people could theoretically be born
<br>
Alphas if left untampered. This theoretical concept of a fully alpha'd
<br>
society supported completely by an automated society of robots was
<br>
posited in the end but untested (what had been tested was the idea of
<br>
Alphas filling every position in society, including drudgework
<br>
positions). Huxley could not extrapolate this accurately because such a
<br>
society has never occured before.
<br>
<p>While your 'short step' is something a luddite would accuse an extropian
<br>
of, we'd rather advocate that everyone receive genetic therapy in the
<br>
womb to maximize all potentials (as well as mandate that those that
<br>
choose to use their bodies as person manufacturing facilities behave in
<br>
compliance with OSHA regulations: i.e. no smoking, exposure to smoke or
<br>
other toxic substances like alchohol, drugs, etc.) I'm for maximizing
<br>
liberty, including that of the occupant of that person manufacturing
<br>
facility. Optimally its rights should not be any less important than the
<br>
mothers.
