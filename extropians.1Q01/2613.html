<em>&gt;  &gt;Be careful with these kind of rumor pages.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes.  Never believe everything you read.
</em><br>
<p><p>Further information:
<br>
<p>CNN is now reporting that President Bush denies the story.  He says 
<br>
there may have been &quot;a few&quot; pranks, but nothing like the rumors are 
<br>
reporting.  He says that there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing 
<br>
and in any case there will be no investigation.
<br>
<p>CNN further reports that it cannot find any witnesses who claim to 
<br>
have seen the damage that has been described.  Thus far, all the 
<br>
persons they have contacted in the actual offices are saying that 
<br>
they were in order or were being renovated.  Thus far, this is 
<br>
strictly an unconfirmed rumor.  Nobody can be found who actually 
<br>
claims to have seen the damage firsthand.  All reports have been from 
<br>
a friend-of-a-friend variety.
<br>
<p>The Drudge Report seems to be the source of this story.  All other 
<br>
articles seem to quote verbatim from the original Drudge Report 
<br>
article or cite it directly.  Although the Drudge Report has also 
<br>
posted all these follow-up articles creating a circle of 
<br>
self-referencing confirmation, it still seems to be the source of the 
<br>
original story.  None of the other reporters could cite independent 
<br>
sources.
