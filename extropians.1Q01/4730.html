Well, most of them aren't that 'touchy', it was just something about which
<br>
I know they can be sensitive,
<br>
since most Westerners tend to think in Christian terms (whether they are or not) and it doesn't work here.
<br>
I hardly think being asked to be polite is a good reason not to discuss something with someone.

<em>&gt; Just a point of politeness, but if you're ever discussing this with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslim, don't call it theology. Apparently one of the tenets of Islam is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that since God is unknowable, you can't study him (theo-ology), and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might take it as an insult. Not necessarily, but you never know.
</em><br>
<p>If they're that touchy, reason may temp extropians to avoid discussing this with a Muslim at all.
