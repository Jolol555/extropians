<p>We already commented on this weeks ago.  IT is a two-wheeled scooter 
<br>
with advanced stability controls.  This can be determined from the 
<br>
patent office filing which is public domain.  It may have a new power 
<br>
system.  Many people  have denounced the hype surrounding IT as 
<br>
exaggerated claims.  The inventor himself says that he doesn't know 
<br>
why people are hyping this up so much.  Even though he agreed not to 
<br>
release any details, he says the hype is way out of proportion.  The 
<br>
famous people who have seen it and have been quoted on it have said 
<br>
that their quotes have been taken out of context and deliberately 
<br>
distributed to generate more baseless hype for this invention. 
<br>
Whatever it is, IT is supposed to be good, but not a tenth of what 
<br>
the hype is suggesting.
