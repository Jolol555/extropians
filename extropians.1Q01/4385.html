This is a belated comment on an earlier discussion, but since a
<br>
theatrical re-release of this film will be underway in the U.K.,
<br>
France, Germany, Japan and Australia starting this spring, and
<br>
will **probably** come to the U.S. (along with a new DVD mastering)
<br>
before the end of the year, I guess it's still relevant.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, Warner Bros. (current owner of the film: the
<br>
chronological sequence of ownership is MGM -&gt; Turner -&gt; Warners, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.dvdfile.com/news/special_report/features/studio/liberationofmgm.htm">http://www.dvdfile.com/news/special_report/features/studio/liberationofmgm.htm</a> )
<br>
has apparently not yet announced any **specific** re-release plans for
<br>
the U.S., see

<p>None of the Kubrick films I've seen (which only include the ones

<br>
<p>SPOILER WARNING
<br>
<p>Gilliatt gets at the heart of Kubrick's bleak portrayal of modern
<br>
technological society:  &quot;The film is... hideously funny -- like
<br>
Dr. Strangelove -- about human speech and response at a point where they have
<br>
begun to seem computerized, and where more and more people sound like
<br>
recordings left on while the soul is out...  The grim joke is that life in 2001
<br>
is only faintly more gruesome in its details of sophisticated affluence than it
<br>
is now...&quot;  When Dr. Heywood Floyd disembarks from the Pan Am shuttle, he is
<br>
greeted on the space station by a pink plastic receptionist (Miss Turner) with
<br>
forced cheerfulness: &quot;Did you have a **pleasant** flight?&quot;.  As Gilliatt
<br>
remarks, &quot;He [Floyd] takes the inanities of space personnel on the chin. 'Did
<br>
you have a pleasant flight?' Smile, smile. Another smile, possibly pre-filmed,
<br>
from a girl on a television monitor handling voice-print identification at
<br>
Immigration...  The citizens of 2001 have forgotten how to joke and resist,
<br>
just as they have forgotten how to chat, speculate, grow intimate, or interest
<br>
one another...  [Dr. Floyd] telephones his daughter by television for her
<br>
birthday, but he has nothing to say, and his wife is out; an astronaut on the
<br>
nine month mission to Jupiter gets a prerecorded TV birthday message from his
<br>
parents.  That's the sum of intimacy.&quot;  All of this coldness and bleakness is
<br>
admirably reinforced by the classical and avant-garde music of the soundtrack,
<br>
particularly Khachaturian's Gayaneh ballet suite, heard during the opening
<br>
scenes aboard the Discovery.
<br>
<p>Gilliatt observes:  &quot;The film is hypnotically entertaining, and it is
<br>
funny without once being gaggy, but it is also rather harrowing. It is as
<br>
eloquent about what is missing from the people of 2001 as about what is there.
<br>
The characters seem isolated almost beyond endurance. Even in the most absurd
<br>
scenes, there is often a fugitive melancholy -- as astronauts solemnly watch
<br>
themselves on homey B.B.C. interviews seen millions of miles from Earth, for
<br>
instance, or as they burn their fingers on their space meals, prepared with
<br>
the utmost scientific care but a shade too hot to touch, or as they plod
<br>
around a centrifuge to get some exercise, shadowboxing alone past white
<br>
coffins where the rest of the Crew hibernates in deep freeze. Separation
<br>
from other people is total and unmentioned. Kubrick has no characters in
<br>
the film who are sexually related, nor any close friends. Communication
<br>
is stuffy and guarded, made at the level of men together on committees
<br>
or of someone being interviewed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kubrick seems to relish foregrounding the banal conversation and behavior of
<br>
Floyd and the other space bureaucrats against the cosmic significance of the
<br>
lunar Monolith, giving the viewer the comical scene of the spacesuited Floyd
<br>
and his companions being lined up by a photographer like tourists in front of
<br>
the Monolith at the Tycho excavation site, and the earlier conversation in the
<br>
&quot;rocket bus&quot; transporting Floyd from Clavius base to the TMA-1 excavation site:
<br>
<p>DR. ROBERT MICHAELS (carrying sandwich container):  Well, anybody hungry?
<br>
<p>DR. HEYWOOD FLOYD:  Ah, great!
<br>
<p>DR. RALPH HALVORSEN:  Yeah!
<br>
<p>FLOYD:  Whadda we got?
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  You name it.
<br>
<p>FLOYD:  What's that, chicken?
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  Something like that.  Tastes the same, anyway. (laughs)
<br>
<p>FLOYD:  Huh. (laughs)
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  Got any ham?
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  Ham, ham, ham, ham....  There it is.
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  Oh yeah, there.  Good.
<br>
<p>FLOYD:  Ahhh....  They look pretty good!
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  Well, we're getting better at it all the time. (laughs)
<br>
<p>FLOYD: Laughs.
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  You know, that was an excellent speech you gave us,
<br>
Heywood.
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  It certainly was.
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.
<br>
<p>FLOYD (with mouth full):  Thanks, Ralph.  Oh by the way, I
<br>
wanted to say to both of you I think you've done a wonderful
<br>
job.  I appreciate the way you've handled this thing.
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  Well, the way we look at it, it's... our job to do
<br>
this thing the way **you** want it done...  we're only too
<br>
happy to be able to oblige.
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  Have you seen these yet?
<br>
<p>FLOYD:  What are they?
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  Yeah, have a look at them.
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  Here's what started the whole thing.
<br>
<p>FLOYD:  Oh, yeah.
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  When we first found it we thought it might be an
<br>
outcrop of magnetic rock, but all the geological evidence was
<br>
against it.  And not even a big nickel-iron meteorite could
<br>
produce a field as intense as this, so, we decided to have a
<br>
look!
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  We thought it might be the upper part of some buried
<br>
structure, so we excavated out on all sides, but unfortunately
<br>
we didn't find anything else. (takes another bite of sandwich)
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  And what's more, the evidence seems pretty conclusive
<br>
that...  it hasn't been covered up by natural erosion or other
<br>
forces, it...  seems to have been deliberately buried.
<br>
<p>FLOYD (chomping on sandwich):  Deliberately buried!  (shakes head) Huh, ha!
<br>
<p>MICHAELS:  Well.  How 'bout a little coffee?
<br>
<p>FLOYD:  Oh, great!
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  Good idea.
<br>
<p>FLOYD (wiping mouth with napkin):  I don't suppose you have any
<br>
idea what the damn thing is, huh?
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN (laughing conspiratorially):  Hoo, hoo.  Wish the hell
<br>
we did.  Nope...  the only thing we're sure of is it was buried
<br>
four million years ago.
<br>
<p>FLOYD:  Well, I must say...  you guys have certainly come up with
<br>
something!
<br>
<p>HALVORSEN:  Ha, ha.
<br>
<p>MICHAELS (pouring coffee)  Watch this, now, it's hot.
<br>
<p>A photo caption on p. 75 of the Bizony book (_2001: Filming the Future_)
<br>
reads:  &quot;The banality of realism:  A stewardess relaxes in Kubrick's
<br>
garish space station -- a place no less horrible than most of today's
<br>
airport lounges.&quot;  This realism was achieved by close consultation with
<br>
some of the premier American corporate custodians of high technology
<br>
(see &quot;_2001: A Space Odyssey_ in Retrospect&quot; by Frederick I. Ordway III
<br>
at <a href="http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0075.html">http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0075.html</a> ) who were probably
<br>
happy enough to see their corporate names in a big-screen high-tech
<br>
extravaganza, and likely didn't pick up on Kubrick's ironic intentions.
<br>
<p>Here's a bit of trivia I wasn't aware of until I saw the Bizony book.
<br>
Another photo caption on p. 85 reads &quot;Company car:  Fred Ordway persuaded
<br>
major manufacturers to supply props, such as this 1966 concept car from
<br>
General Motors.  It was used as the background for the trite
<br>
television love scene which sends Heywood Floyd to sleep during his
<br>
space shuttle trip.&quot;  The car in the photo's foreground is the Firebird IV,
<br>
an experimental car which I saw in the flesh in the summer of 1965
<br>
in the &quot;Avenue of Progress&quot; at the end of the &quot;Futurama II&quot; ride in
<br>
the General Motors pavilion at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair.  However,
<br>
the car in the film is not in fact the Firebird IV, it is the other car barely
<br>
visible in the background of the Bizony photo, the &quot;Runabout&quot;.  Both these cars,
<br>
and photos from the rest of the Futurama II exhibit, can be seen at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.nywf64.com/nywf64set.html">http://www.nywf64.com/nywf64set.html</a> (scroll the left frame down to
<br>
&quot;Transportation Area&quot;, click on General Motors; then scroll to the bottom
<br>
of the right frame and click &quot;Next&quot;, then scroll the right frame down
<br>
to Gallery One).  The GM Futurama II is one of my favorite icons of the
<br>
past of &quot;The Future&quot; (I wasn't around for the original GM Futurama in
<br>
'39 -- you can read about that in David Gelernter's book); cf. Paul Simon's
<br>
lyric &quot;And I believe these are the days of lasers in the jungle,
<br>
lasers in the jungle somewhere&quot; from &quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; on the
<br>
_Graceland_ album, Warner Bros. 9 25447-2.
<br>
<p>In the January Extropians' thread on this film, Tom Hanks is quoted
<br>
from <a href="http://www.space.com/news/spacehistory/hanks_2001_yearender.html">http://www.space.com/news/spacehistory/hanks_2001_yearender.html</a>
<br>
as saying &quot;And my God, when that bone gets thrown up in the air and
<br>
you make that transformation into an orbiting bomb -- the greatest time-cut
<br>
in the history of cinema -- and the &quot;Blue Danube&quot; started up, I mean, I was
<br>
in heaven. I felt as though the universe were expanding before my very eyes.&quot;
<br>
Gilliatt also mentions this famous jump cut to a matching shot:
<br>
&quot;...one of the apes, squatting in front of a bed of bones, picks up his first
<br>
weapon. In slow motion, the hairy arm swings up into an empty frame and then
<br>
down again, and the smashed bones bounce into the air...  The last bone thrown
<br>
in the air is matched, in the next cut, to a spaceship at the same angle [not
<br>
the same angle on my DVD, but it's not surprising Gilliatt remembered it that
<br>
way].  It is now 2001.&quot;  As well as providing a cinematically effective
<br>
transition from the prehistoric past to the technological future (I remember,
<br>
when the blue sky framing the bone as it has just started to descend abruptly
<br>
changed into the blackness of space surrounding a satellite which is also
<br>
descending in the frame, grabbing the arms of my theater seat as though I
<br>
were going to fall into the screen), Kubrick is making a terribly cynical
<br>
observation about the significance of Man's awakening into sentience -- the
<br>
bone club, the first product of awakened human intelligence, isn't just the
<br>
first tool, it's also the first **weapon**; and in the jump cut it
<br>
metamorphoses into, not a spaceship, but the latest state-of-the-art **weapon**
<br>
(not explicitly identified as such in the film, but what looks like a
<br>
gun-turret on both the first and second of the orbiting white cylinders is
<br>
suggestive of weaponry -- perhaps an orbiting laser or particle-beam
<br>
weapon).  There's certainly more than a hint of _Dr. Strangelove_ here.
<br>
<p>HAL, the artifical intelligence on board the spaceship Discovery, comes
<br>
across as more lively than the cardboard-cutout human beings sleepwalking
<br>
across the screen, despite (or perhaps even all the more because of) the
<br>
fact that it goes berserk.  Gilliatt comments: &quot;The computer on the Jupiter
<br>
spaceship -- a chatty, fussy genius called HAL, which has nice manners and a
<br>
rather querulous need for reassurance about being wanted -- talks more like a
<br>
human being than any human being does in the picture. HAL runs the craft,
<br>
watches over the rotating quota of men in deep freeze, and plays chess. He
<br>
gives a lot of thought to how he strikes others, and sometimes carries on
<br>
about himself like a mother fussing on the telephone to keep a bored grown
<br>
child hanging on.&quot;  This observation reminded me of a similar one I recently
<br>
came across in a review of Iain Banks' _Excession_ (by Charles Shaar Murray,
<br>
from the July 26, 1996 _New Statesman_, at
<br>
<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m0FQP/n4294_v125/18538882/print.jhtml">http://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m0FQP/n4294_v125/18538882/print.jhtml</a> ):
<br>
&quot;In a long and honourable SF tradition, from Frankenstein's monster to
<br>
Trek's Commander Data, The Culture's AIs tend to be rather more 'human' than
<br>
the majority of its citizens.&quot;
<br>
<p>So no, _2001_ isn't an action movie; it doesn't offer music-video-style,
<br>
fast-paced entertainment along the lines of _The Matrix_.  This isn't
<br>
just a matter of the film having been made in the creaky old 1960's,
<br>
either -- contemporary critics recognized from the outset that
<br>
this was likely to be a difficult movie for mainstream audiences, as shown
<br>
by these quotes from a 1968 review in the Harvard _Crimson_ (at
<br>
<a href="http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0038.html">http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0038.html</a> ):
<br>
&quot;..._2001_ is probable commercial poison...  [a] sure-fire audience baffler
<br>
guaranteed to empty any theater of ten percent of its audience...
<br>
Kubrick's dilemma in terms of satisfying an audience is that his best
<br>
work in _2001_ is plotless slow-paced material...&quot;  Nevertheless, if
<br>
you're at all susceptible to Kubrick's style of understated irony, this is a
<br>
film that is likely to grow on you, and get better (and funnier) with repeated
<br>
viewing.  The technology still looks great, due to Kubrick's fanatical
<br>
devotion to realism, but the glossy, expensive panoply of techno-toys
<br>
is sent up by Kubrick's subtle mockery,  Even technophiles can learn to
<br>
appreciate the irony, if they have a bit of patience and a sense of humor.
<br>
Also, one can take some comfort that in the real year 2001, things don't
<br>
seem quite as stuffy as a pessimist looking forward from the military-
<br>
industrial culture of the 1960's might have feared.
<br>
<p>Granting that it may be funny, is _2001_ Extropian, or Singularitarian,
<br>
or Transhumanist?  Well of course it is in a sense, except that the
<br>
deux ex machina in the film isn't AI (though AI exists) or anything
<br>
coming out of merely human technology, it's a pair of mysterious artifacts
<br>
left by meddling aliens apparently kick-starting sentience throughout the
<br>
galaxy a la patrons and progenitors in David Brin's &quot;Uplift&quot; stories (I think
<br>
it's a sign of _2001_'s failure with mainstream audiences that UFO
<br>
abductees do not report having been guests in fancy hotels :-&gt;).
<br>
It is purely Singularitarian in the Vingean sense of the Singularity
<br>
as a point in time beyond which we cannot attempt to forecast, because
<br>
when the Star Child reappears in near-Earth space we have no idea
<br>
what will happen next, and the movie gives no clue.
<br>
<p>By the way, the closeup shots of HAL getting lobotomized suggest
<br>
a paradigm shift beyond the integrated circuits we know and love today
<br>
(Intel was founded the year _2001_ was released) that, unfortunately,
<br>
hasn't happened yet.  The three-dimensional, crystalline circuit blocks in
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/2001/2001_small.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/2001/2001_small.jpg</a> (13K)
<br>
<a href="http://members.home.net/fehlinger/2001/2001.jpg">http://members.home.net/fehlinger/2001/2001.jpg</a> (193K)
<br>
suggest to me a plausible representation of optical processing
<br>
elements, though the movie says no such thing.  Clarke's novel says
<br>
only (in Chapter 15, &quot;Hal&quot;):  &quot;In the 1980s, Minsky and Good had
<br>
shown how neural networks [**Minsky** and neural networks? Rosenblatt
<br>
must've appreciated that!] could be generated automatically --
<br>
self-replicated -- in accordance with an arbitrary learning program.
<br>
Artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly similar to the
<br>
development of a human brain.  In any given case, the precise details
<br>
could never be known, and even if they were, they would be millions of
<br>
times too complex for human understanding.&quot;  And later in Chapter 28,
<br>
&quot;In Vacuum&quot;:  &quot;He released the locking bar on the section labelled
<br>
COGNITIVE FEEDBACK and pulled out the first memory block.  The marvellously
<br>
complex three-dimensional network, which could lie comfortably in a man's
<br>
hand yet contained millions [only millions? :-&gt;] of elements, floated
<br>
away across the vault.&quot;  The red light illuminating HAL's sanctum
<br>
sanctorum may simply have looked good to Kubrick, or may have been meant
<br>
to suggest the blood-red interior of an organic brain, but I've thought
<br>
of another explanation -- the darkroom-red illumination may have been
<br>
necessary to avoid interfering with HAL's optical processors (:-&gt;).

aunts along with my cousin and his wife and children (three girls and a boy).
<br>
The oldest girl is high-school age, and I learned to my amazement that
<br>
she is fond of movies from the 30's, and particularly Fred Astaire and
<br>
Ginger Rogers (whom I certainly had not known about when I was in high
<br>
school).  I spent an afternoon with the kids and their mother watching
<br>
_The Gay Divorcee_ from my aunt's home-video library.  Listening to
<br>
them sing along with &quot;The Continental&quot; was a slightly surreal experience
<br>
for me.  It's certainly a brave new media world (with the Web now piled
<br>
on top of everything else) -- not memory-denuded: incredibly rich,
<br>
but ever more fragmented into pockets of special interests, apart from the
<br>
frantic mass-marketing and insistent distraction of the new.  Are you ready
<br>
for the first installment of the cinematic _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy
<br>
this Christmas?
<br>
<p>Cheers.
<br>
