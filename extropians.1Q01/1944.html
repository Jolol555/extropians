<p><em>&gt;  In self-defense, lethality is irrelevant; stopping the

</em><br>
<p><p>Got it.......so hyper-velocity, depleted uranium is OUT for Self Defense.
<br>
<p>So how about this......a shaped explosive charge?
<br>
<p>No.....really.....we're talking advanced technological design right?  MEMS 
<br>
perhaps if not actual nanotech?  So whats to prevent (other than 
<br>
Murphy)......the design of a miniscule shaped explosvie charge on the tip of 
<br>
the projectile such that upon contact it goes BOOM.....the boom being 
<br>
directed at the bad guy.......from up close and personal...

<p><p><em>&gt; The smart thing to do is sell non-reloadable magazines that

</em><br>
<p><p>Good point.....I like that....
<br>
<p>Other posts by other individuals have also pointed out other problems...which 
<br>
may or may not be show-stoppers...
<br>
<p><p>1  some bright but unethical individual being able to &quot;hack&quot; the system..
<br>
2 dirty cops...
<br>
<p>just to name two.
<br>
<p>I dunno what could be done about the cops....
<br>
<p>However.........hacking the system might not be a show stopper.
<br>
<p>Consider.....suppose the device (it's a little MORE than just a 
<br>
gun).......were built in such a manner that any attempt to alter it rendered 
<br>
it useless.....built in tamperproffing.
<br>
<p>Also suppose that it was built using MEMS technology.......with all the 
<br>
software in ROM.....I mean....how DO you go about altering the physical 
<br>
components in .....say.......a Pentium III microchip?    Certain things just 
<br>
can't be changed without VERY special tools.......if at all.  Build the whole 
<br>
thing (or at least the ammo/magazine) using fab technology.....(ignoring the 
<br>
economics here)..
<br>
<p>Version 2.0
<br>
<p>Laser Targeted Multiple Launched(say a three shot burst per trigger pull)  
<br>
Mini-Scram Jets Tipped with Shaped charges...range.......closeup...say thirty 
<br>
feet...this thing is ment to replace a holdout or &quot;belly&quot; gun..
<br>
<p>Non -reloadable tamperproof  ID'd magazines...
<br>
<p>Practice Magazines available without extra &quot;features&quot;... ...for familiarity 
<br>
and target practice...
<br>
<p>Radio Snitch to the Cops upon launch of &quot;live&quot; ammo......as well as taggat 
<br>
relase..
<br>
<p>Assuming the Cops are good guys.......
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners of the Personel Defender are given a training course as well 
<br>
as allowed (encouraged) to attend regular   practice sessions   at the police 
<br>
fireing range...(the policeman is your freiiiiiiiiind)..
<br>
<p><p>oh well.....yeah....I'm dreaming....
