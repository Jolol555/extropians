<em>&gt;Nothing that most of us don't already know, but here's a scary set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facts, considering the importance to us of continued and accelerated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technical change:
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If competitive success is achieved through people, then the skills of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people are critical. Consequently, one of the most obvious implications of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the changing basis of competitive success is the growing importance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having a work force with adequate skills. Historical studies show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between 1929 and 1982, education prior to work accounted for 26% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth in the productive capacity of the United States, with learning on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the job contributing to an additional 55%. It seems clear that &quot;learning in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school and learning on the job are by far the most important factors behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American economic growth and productivity in this century, and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determine the nation's economic prospects in the next.&quot;(33) The evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;however, is that skill problems in the U.S. work force are widespread and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moreover, there is little evidence that U.S. employers, for the most part,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are doing what is required to address this problem. Regarding the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point, the skill problem, an overview of training and preparation for work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concluded, &quot;As we approach the end of this century, it becomes ever more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apparent that the demand for more skilled workers is on a collision course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the quantity and quality of the labor supply.&quot;(34) In an article
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reporting the declining position of the United States in world trade in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;telecommunications equipment, the New York Telephone Company reported that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;it tested 57,000 job applicants in 1987 and found that 54,900, or 96.3%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lacked basic skills in math, reading, and reasoning.&quot;(35) A human resource
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planning document prepared at the Bank of America in 1990 reported that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Chemical Bank in New York must interview 40 applicants to find one who can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be successfully trained as a teller&quot;;(36) &quot;at Pacific Bell in Los Angeles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;95% of the 3,500 people who recently took a competency test for entry-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jobs not requiring a high school education failed&quot;; and &quot;at Motorola, 80%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of its applicants cannot pass a simple 7th grade English comprehension or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;5th grade math test. At Bell South in Atlanta, fewer than 1 in 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applicants meet all qualification standards.&quot;(37)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A U.S. Department of Education report covering document, prose, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quantitative literacy summarized the findings of a study mandated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Congress because of its concern about skill deficiencies in the work place
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and came to equally grim conclusions.(38) For instance, in 1986, only about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;50% of all high school graduates achieved literacy at a level that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enable them to follow directions to travel from one location to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;using a map, and only 10% of the graduates could use a bus schedule to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;select the appropriate bus for given departures and arrivals.(39) Only 3%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of high school graduates could orally interpret distinctions between types
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of employee benefits, and just 4.5% could estimate cost using grocery
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unit-price labels.(40) Assessments of mathematical proficiency are also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distressing.(41) Almost one-quarter of high school seniors could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accurately determine the cost of a simple meal from a short menu of items
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and prices,(42) and fewer than half &quot;demonstrated a consistent grasp of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decimals, percents, fractions, and simple algebra.&quot;(43)
</em><br>

<p><p>Your implicit agreementr with the gist of this article seems at odds with 
<br>
your Libertarian stance. Why should a Lib care if others in the country 
<br>
(Libs don't like countries anyway, etc etc) he happens to live in are (most 
<br>
certainly arguably IMO) less skilled than they should?
