From: Max More &lt;<a href="mailto:max@maxmore.com?Subject=Re:%20ECON:%20Re:%20Lack%20of%20skilled%20people%20in%20the%20USA&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101311510.HAA23872@well.com&gt;">max@maxmore.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In an article reporting the declining position of the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;States in world trade in telecommunications equipment, the New
</em><br>
<em>&gt;York Telephone Company reported that &quot;it tested 57,000 job
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applicants in 1987 and found that 54,900, or 96.3% lacked basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skills in math, reading, and reasoning.&quot;(35) A human resource
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planning document prepared at the Bank of America in 1990 reported
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that &quot;Chemical Bank in New York must interview 40 applicants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find one who can be successfully trained as a teller&quot;;(36) &quot;at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pacific Bell in Los Angeles, 95% of the 3,500 people who recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;took a competency test for entry-level jobs not requiring a high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;school education failed&quot;; and &quot;at Motorola, 80% of its applicants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot pass a simple 7th grade English comprehension or 5th grade
</em><br>
<em>&gt;math test. At Bell South in Atlanta, fewer than 1 in 10 applicants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meet all qualification standards.&quot;(37)
</em><br>
<p>The company I work for is having the same problem. Their solution?
<br>
Lower standards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(39) Only 3% of high school graduates could orally interpret
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinctions between types of employee benefits, 
</em><br>
<p>I'm facing this tonight, the company has decided it doesn't like
<br>
the new Union contract and has been in negotiating with the Union
<br>
for a separate agreement. While we won't see the agreement till
<br>
tonight, rumors have it as a bad deal.
<br>
<p>The company is offering personnal days and a signing bonus trying
<br>
to get members to sign, but one of the casualties is the $3.38 an
<br>
hour they have to pay into a separate annuity as part of the
<br>
existing contract.
<br>
<p>My associates and I are trying to educate members they will
<br>
literally be giving away a million dollars if they sign this deal.
<br>
<p>This may actually backfire on the company, if this deal goes
<br>
through, some of it's most qualified people will have little choice
<br>
but to leave.
