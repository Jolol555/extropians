<p>Sorry, pal, this is the standard ignorati travesty of darwinist
<br>
evolutionary theory. I'm shocked to see it mentioned here in this gun
<br>
forum, but as I said earlier I'm not surprised, given a number of your
<br>
earlier remarks.
<br>
<p>Evolution is precisely *not* a theory of coincidence. It's a model of how
<br>
heritable random genotypic and thence phenotypic variations subjected to
<br>
contest in the real unforgiving world are thereby sieved, and improvements
<br>
preferentially conserved. Natural *selection*, geddit?
<br>

</em><br>
<p>We both see a high degree of order. You, I gather, see a Mind from outside
<br>
the system intervening top-down to produce an echo of Its own order. I,
<br>
like most of the scientists in the world, see the painfully cruel accretion
<br>
of 
<br>
organization over billions of years from a state of utter noise, driven
<br>
ultimately by gravitational and other energetic gradients in an expanding
<br>
universe. Whether or not there are ancillary aspects of the universal
<br>
substrate conducting to spontaneous order (as, say, Stuart Kauffman
<br>
argues), the fact remains that darwinian selection is the best available
<br>
explanation for the diversity of phenomena we observe - including, as Lee
<br>
Smolin and others argue, the very features of the local universe that
<br>
conduce to organic life evolving in the first place.
<br>
<p>This last is not an Intelligent Mind reaching out of Platoland to stir the
<br>
muck with a Finger; it's a cosmic crap shoot where even the very unlikely
<br>
happens eventually. At this enormous level, yes, it's happenstance. Beyond
<br>
that, once the substrate emerges, everything is randomness *plus* that
<br>
ceaseless selective sieve, and the great energy gradient powering it all.
<br>
What's difficult to grasp in this wonderful explanation?
<br>
<p>To address a general point: the Singularity talk I gave at a university the
<br>
other day was quickly interrupted by a young man who made somewhat similar
<br>
points to yours, although he was quite proud to call himself a creationist;
<br>
under pressure he admitted that he was a Christian creationist (why the
<br>
reluctance? because it showed him as a partisan). Reflecting later, I
<br>
concluded that I ought to have answered him thus:
<br>
<p>Q.  Don't forget that the *theory* of evolution is only a *theory*, not a
<br>
*fact*. Indeed, most leading scientists from the Billy-Bob College of
<br>
Ineffable Knowledge have conclusively demonstrated that--
<br>
<p>A:  Hang on a moment. You're right - biological evolution is indeed `just a
<br>
theory' - that is, an always provisional broad framework for organizing our
<br>
many observations of the living world and allowing competent scientists
<br>
trained in the discipline to make powerful, unexpected and falsifiable
<br>
predictions. In the same way, the *theories* of relativity (the universe at
<br>
the very large, very fast scale) and quantum theory (the universe at the
<br>
very smallest scale) are also *theories*. They are very good theories, too,
<br>
since their logic has held up extraordinarily well under powerful attempts
<br>
to break it down, and their predictions are repeatedly corroborated in ways
<br>
highly counterintuitive to common sense, with a startling degree of
<br>
accuracy to many decimal points.
<br>
<p>Creationism, on the other hand, is *not* a *theory*. It is a *dogma*. In
<br>
the final analysis it derives its claim to legitimacy not from concerted,
<br>
falsifiable attempts to understand the natural world by observation,
<br>
theory-building and test, but directly from a purported revelation from the
<br>
Supreme Being or Creator. Despite some admitted translation hazards, its
<br>
claims--drawn from a revelation given directly by the divine to human
<br>
creatures-- ought not be put to the test, for this would be impiety.
<br>
Creation *science*, therefore, is an oxymoron, since by its own premises it
<br>
must speak the timeless and unchallengeable truth: its proper name,
<br>
therefore, is Creation *Doctrine*.
<br>
<p>Since we are discussing science rather than dogma here today, I'm afraid we
<br>
must put your interesting religious observations to one side and proceed
<br>
with the scheduled program.
<br>
<p>Hmmm...
