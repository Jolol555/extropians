</em><br>
<p>Hmm, yes, I did. [Response below]
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Not that I'm completely against more flexibility in

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually, I'm not sure how we can significantly improve the quality of
<br>
teachers without improving the system. I would think that many bad teachers
<br>
are bad partially also because the system makes it difficult for them to be
<br>
good; so they gave up trying.
<br>
<p>I do agree that everything would be great if all teachers were 100% perfect.
<br>
If all teachers were interesting, motivating, knowledgeable, and fair, a
<br>
strict curriculum would be less of a problem. But I don't see how to switch
<br>
to manufacturing all great teachers without changing the system - seeing
<br>
that the system *is* what manufactures bad teachers right now.
<br>
<p>So, I think the system is the core of the problem. [At least in our country,
<br>
which doesn't necessarily mean anything for the USA.]
<br>
<p>I will not claim that I have a recipe on how to make it better though. But I
<br>
think at least someone should try.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
