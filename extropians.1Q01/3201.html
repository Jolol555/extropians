<p>Well, if a recording surfaces, it will be a bit difficult to prove
<br>
that it was indeed me who recorded it, and also made it available. It could
<br>
be my wife's detective, or my kid doing a technological lark. Yessir, your
<br>
honour, that's exactly how it went down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And don't be expecting the media to run with your illegally-recorded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence, either--at least until The Supremes decide this one:
</em><br>
<p>I dunno about the media, but I can publish it on Freenet or MojoNation.
<br>
You may think it's a small thing, if a video depicting a fully identified 
<br>
officer during unlawful activities is being irretractably published, for
<br>
everybody with eyes too see, but the police office and the citizens might 
<br>
be of another opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You might also check out the info on recording equipment in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courthouses. No rational reason to prevent participants from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recording the events, of course. (Court reporters will likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree.) I can state from experience that official court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcripts can be at variance with reality.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think it is my damn right to record whatever it damn
<br>
pleases me in my vicinity, whatever other people might think.
<br>
If they're of another opinion, they shouln't let the photons
<br>
fly my way.

<em>&gt; Also of interest--access a password-protected site without permission
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This happens when you try pulling old categories into new areas.
<br>
Packet sniffing is a lot like wire tapping, accessing a password-protected
<br>
site illegally is accessing a password-protected site illegally. It is
<br>
a bit like entering a house by picking a lock, except from the fact that it
<br>
isn't. A hard drive is not a house, I don't live in a 19&quot; rack.
