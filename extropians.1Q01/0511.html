From: &quot;Spike Jones&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:spike66@attglobal.net?Subject=Re:%20CULTURE:%20Chicago%20Tribune%20on%20Futurists%20(Includes%20Extropians)&In-Reply-To=&lt;0d2d01c0789d$27235740$39bc473f@jrmolloy&gt;">spike66@attglobal.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm.  I didnt make this clear at all.  I dont mean make a 3D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain outta silicon.  I meant a silicon microprocessor running a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation of carbon-based brain cells.  I suppose the first time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we make a real silicon based sim of a brain, it would run much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slower than realtime, perhaps one millionth as fast.  It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not much of a conversationalist.  At first.
</em><br>
<p>That would be one way to do it, I suppose. Another way would be to augment
<br>
and enhance an ordinary human brain (OK, for the sake of argument, I'll
<br>
volunteer) until it becomes an alien intelligence. Yeah, the old Borg
<br>
scenario.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But also a solution.  We can run AI in geosynchronous orbit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with restricted downlink.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like an orbital version of the Global Brain (3rd generation
<br>
Internet).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  we have then two alternatives: one unknown and one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unabiguously bad.  I choooooose...  the unknown.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it's not all that unknown... if we keep testing the alien
<br>
intelligence as it is being developed, give it plenty of theses to write
<br>
and experiments to conduct, and give it MMPI and other psych tests along
<br>
the way, it's profile will become known around the world (and not just
<br>
because it's in orbit). ô¿ô
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, this whole thread has been tremendously insightful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the two choices, I personally would choose taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my chances with a possibly hostile AI than simply dying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old fashioned way.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, especially if the possibly hostile alien intelligence turns out to be
<br>
our most promising hope of attaining indefinitely extended life spans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet if I had heirs, I see the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of view of the Luddites, who would prefer to relinquish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology and hand a low-tech world to their children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and grandchildren.
</em><br>
<p>Of all the scenarios presented here, I find this the most unlikely to
<br>
occur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I myself see the entire exercise as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless if they too are to grow old and die.  Yet I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see where some may logically disagree.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Well, just because life is pointless doesn't mean that it's not worth
<br>
living. One of the first hurdles in the education of an alien intelligence
<br>
would, of course, involve the question of the significance of life, and
<br>
how to deal with meaningless existence.
<br>
<p>Life means to find out. ô¿ô
