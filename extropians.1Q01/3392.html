SPIKE! SPIKE! I HAVE YOUR SOLUTION!
<br>
<p>What you need to do is recruit pygmies, midgets, and dwarves for 
<br>
astronaut training and perhaps voluntary selective breeding. Have 
<br>
them carry the goop to make full-sized humans when they get there. Of 
<br>
course, you may well wind up with a society whose idea of a good time 
<br>
is boiled heads and roasted aardvarks, but what the heck...
<br>
<p>Things you're not considering: Whoever goes, if it's a one-way trip 
<br>
they won't be happy campers. Even if they were volunteers, they'll 
<br>
come to resent those who sent them, perhaps everyone on earth. Not a 
<br>
good thing for those in charge of beginning a second civilization.
<br>
<p>Also--you have to feed and air-supply the full-sizers once you've 
<br>
grown them. If you didn't bring the food with you--where's it coming 
<br>
from?
<br>
<p>You mentioned the speed with which civilizations can arise. Sure--but 
<br>
that's here, where you don't need to worry about where your next 
<br>
breath is coming from and the nearest source of abundant food isn't 
<br>
78 million kilometers away on the far side of vacuum.
