<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as video recording (not audio) goes, the courts appear to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; mostly ruled using the notion of &quot;a reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; So how can any interaction with a &quot;public servant&quot; in their official
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; capacity be considered private?
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Gburch? :)
</em><br>
<p>Not my area of specialty, but here's some comments off the top of my head.  
<br>
First, you'd need a more precise definition of what you mean by &quot;privacy&quot;.  
<br>
Clearly, the current Anglo-American legal concepts of SECRECY in dealings 
<br>
with public officials contemplate that some interactions with &quot;public 
<br>
servants&quot; can be kept secret.  Just ask Wen Ho Li in the US or any number of 
<br>
folks who have run afoul of the Official Secrets Act(s) in the UK.  
<br>
<p>On the other hand, since the Pentagon Papers and Watergate there has been a 
<br>
laudable steady erosion of the power of state actors in the US to claim that 
<br>
information they possess can be legally kept from the public.  The federal 
<br>
Freedom of Information Act and its many state counterparts (usually called 
<br>
&quot;sunshine&quot; or &quot;open meeting&quot; laws) create a presumption against the secrecy 
<br>
of information created, gathered and possessed by the government.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, the developing common law of defamation of public figures lays 
<br>
out another vector of insight into the question.  Communications ABOUT people 
<br>
found to be &quot;public figures&quot; (which includes all government actors doing so 
<br>
in their public capacity) are held to a lower standard in the test for 
<br>
actionable defamation.  (Tom knows more about this field, so I hope he'll 
<br>
correct me if I've misstated the law.)
<br>
<p>Finally, common law rules regarding the recording of people's actions and 
<br>
words do seem to ultimately turn on the notion of a &quot;reasonable expectation 
<br>
of privacy.&quot;  If you put all these lines together, they seem to me to point 
<br>
strongly in the direction of making all interactions with government actors 
<br>
freely recordable.
<br>
<p>This is what I had in mind when I posted yesterday about the development of a 
<br>
new presumption regarding evidence derived from near-future PDAs.  If I were 
<br>
sitting on the bench, faced with a questionable arrest in 2015, I would 
<br>
expect to see at LEAST two distinct recordings of the events in question; one 
<br>
from the police and one from the defendant.  The absence of the defendant's 
<br>
recording would automatically make the legality of the arrest suspect and 
<br>
shift the burden to the police to establish that it was constitutional.  
<br>
<p>Now, how would such a presumption impact police behavior?  One, it would make 
<br>
them very careful not to interfere with a citizen's PDA, if she had one.  
<br>
Two, it would encourage people who believe that they might be subject to 
<br>
improper police behavior to get and maintain PDAs.  Three, it would encourage 
<br>
the police to develop and maintain the best possible recording equipment, 
<br>
with the best possible security against tampering - by the police or anyone 
<br>
else.  Finally, it would create on the part of the government a keen interest 
<br>
in the development and implementation of secure, tamper-proof data protocols 
<br>
for EVERYONE, police and citizen alike.
<br>
<p>Criticisms?
