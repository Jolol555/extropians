<em>&gt; I think telepresense is a bit of a sleeper concept which will gain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stronger hold in the next few years. Particularly in countries such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US where fear of the outside world seems pretty extreme, I would expect that

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Frankly, Emlyn, all we really fear is how eager so many foreign people
<br>
seem to be to enslave themselves and surrender their rights as much as
<br>
possible, and how much you all want us to do the same. Outside of that,
<br>
we tend to travel much. However, because our own nation is so large and
<br>
diverse (and inexpensive) we tend to travel within our country, or just
<br>
to either Canada or Mexico. For me, traveling to New York is the same as
<br>
Dennis traveling to Paris, me going to DC is like him going to Belgium
<br>
(actually, I'm traveling further).
<br>
Europeans will take to telepresence for economic reasons: its cheaper
<br>
because transportation in europe is expensive compared to the US. I can
<br>
fly from Boston to Seattle (over 3000 miles) for $350 US in 5-7 hours. I
<br>
can fly to Las Vegas for under $150 on occasion. I can drive to Seattle
<br>
for the same amount of money (in my Jeep) or less than half of that with
<br>
an economy car. The numbers are almost there, here, for employee
<br>
telepresence, to outsource to areas with lower cost of living (i.e.
<br>
Boston companies hiring me to work via telepresence in NH for half the
<br>
money of a Massachusetts resident employee), but only if they are
<br>
willing to loosen up on the control department. Here again, the issues
<br>
of trust of the individual come into play. Its more profitable to trust
<br>
people if those people are trust worthy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, the place that holds your intelligence substrate is a liability;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it breaks, you die. So, options to remove this vulnerability will hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appeal. In the short term, hiding the body away (at home) is likely to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well. In the longer term, we upload and perhaps copy ourselves for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redundancy (if we can just solve those pesky consciousness problems), or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else we all get eaten by grey goo or are replaced by AI SIs... but there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another story.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the way, I'd never wear that armour, or carry a gun for that matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless circumstances were entirely different. It'd impinge on my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of coolness. Can't have that.
