<em>&gt;&gt; It is impossible and too silly a parody to even be amusing.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Awww, come on, Samantha!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suggest that we send Spike along. First, we'll have to lighten him a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little more than he's already done...amputate all non-essential appendages,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surgically remove one lung, one kidney, a gall bladder, most of his gut,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part of his liver, etc. Then instead of an adult-sized uterus vehicle...have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a newborn baby girl accompany him with that stash of assorted frozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embryos.
</em><br>
<p>Heeeyyyyy, I hadnt thought of that, ct!  You are right, tho, that would
<br>
reduce my 125 pound frame to perhaps in the mid 80s and would
<br>
surely reduce my need for food.  Now yer thinking!  Not only that,
<br>
but I bring to the table aerospace engineering skills.  Of course, most
<br>
of this earthbound wisdom would be perfectly useless, along with
<br>
most of my knowledge of literature, etc.
<br>
<p>That idea of bringing an infant girl wont work tho.  That is a definite
<br>
no-no, for she would not be a *volunteer*.  We can use only those
<br>
who want to go so desperately that they would find no meaning in
<br>
life here, should they be left behind.  We can use only those who
<br>
want to go so badly they will gladly have their bodies modified
<br>
surgically to be better suited to their new home.
<br>
<p>This is something I have pondered long and hard.  The embryos
<br>
born on Mars are not exactly volunteers either, however humans
<br>
in general have considered it perfectly ethical to go off into remote
<br>
corners of the world and breed.  Let us call this the missionaries
<br>
dilemma.  I would not be comfortable bringing along a woman
<br>
child, for she would not have attained the age of consent.  And yet
<br>
frozen embryos are fair game, for those born on Mars would not
<br>
long for the gravity field triple that of their home planet.  Ethicists,
<br>
care to comment?
<br>
<p>Medics, just outta curiosity, what is the minimum organage needed
<br>
to sustain life, assuming one intends to spend the rest of it operating
<br>
joy sticks at a control console on Mars?  What else besides ct's list
<br>
could we remove?
<br>
<p>How long before we can surgically transplant a functional uterus
<br>
into the body of a man?  spike
<br>
<p>ps.  Samantha, I will save you some time and go ahead and write
<br>
out my own insults and hurl them at myself.  Ahem.  Spike, you are
<br>
one truly weird messed-up, twisted, insane, [insert Jeff-Davis-ian
<br>
string of adjectives], excuse for a human being!  Be gone with you!
