Not necessarily. If the CEP is small, the infestation is small or
<br>
nascent, and the radius of total destruction is large. And yes, if you
<br>
get the focus and there's none other nearby.
<br>
<p>All very arguable. I was assuming best case; a known lab, still locked
<br>
down, with goo ready to deploy, or barely deployed, with a single focus.
<br>
I have no reason to believe such an optimistic outbreak would occur.
<br>
Just saying, is all.
