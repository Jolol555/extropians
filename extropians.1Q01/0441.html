<em>&gt; &gt;Hofstadter's _Le Ton Beau de Marot_ is about interpretation and translation...
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Amara Graps wrote:  OK, I'm convinced. Now this is a future book for me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read.

<p>Le Ton is tough going, unless you are a specialist in translation
<br>
of course.  There was too much there about which I havent a clue,
<br>
being strictly mono.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Just look at the Bible.  The amount of interpretations and translations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which have been derived from that book boggle the mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did anyone else ever read _Good News for Modern Man_ (I think...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ..I prefer Jesus Christ Superstar (or Life of Brian)  :-)
</em><br>
<p>Consider John Grigg's sheep site, which started this line of
<br>
ruminations:  Revelation 6:16, King James:
<br>
<p>&quot;...[They] said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us...
<br>
from the wrath of the Lamb.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nowthen, for one to prefer rocks on the head to this alternative,
<br>
that must be one thoroughly pissed off lamb.  I dont think Ive ever
<br>
even seen a mildly irritated lamb, never mind one so incensed and
<br>
outraged that I would prefer a cave collapse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...I honestly didn't think that it made much difference. &quot;You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *don't know* and *it doesn't matter*?!&quot; he asks. &quot;No...&quot;, Amara says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sheepishly...
</em><br>
<p>Amara!  One woold think ewe woold know better.  If I ram-
<br>
ember correctly, such details seldom slip pasture notice.
<br>
I hope your Estonian cousin was gentle and did not lamb-
<br>
ast you too severely, or cause you to be shorn of your
<br>
dignity.
<br>
<p>Friends, I apologize.  I just got back from a 15 mile hike,
<br>
25 km to the rest of the world, and I am so exhausted this
<br>
silliness just spilled out of me.  I know I should keep it the
<br>
flock outta the extropians list.  It is baa-aa-aad, I know.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I will start a parallel list, like exi-freedom, where
<br>
we can discuss those difficult and emotional issues such as
<br>
pun control.  spike
