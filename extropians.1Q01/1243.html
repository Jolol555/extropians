<p><em> &gt; I haven't found a copy yet. Anyone care to summarize what the book says
</em><br>
<em> &gt; about the prospects, and likely impact for their project, of an impending
</em><br>
<em> &gt; technological singularity?
</em><br>
<p>They have a short chapter on the singularity. Essentially they don't
<br>
approve of it - it is exactly the kind of planning horizon they
<br>
disapprove of: &quot;Oh, we cannot plan beyond that since by definition
<br>
everything will be changed&quot;, which makes people discount the long
<br>
future. Instead of seeing it as an inevitability (like many here) they
<br>
consider it just another possible scenario that may or may not
<br>
happen. In fact, an unattractive scenario that might even be
<br>
deliberately avoided by people.
<br>
<p>It doesn't really impact the clock project, which is really about more
<br>
than the physical clock. I get the impression that the real impact of
<br>
the project is intended to occur in the present (and then hopefully
<br>
accumulate over long time; I really like some of their library
<br>
projects), so even if everything get changed at some point by a
<br>
singularity it doesn't diminish the present value of the project.
<br>
<p>I liked the book - transhumanism is not just about singularities and
<br>
femtosecond processes, it is also about the real long span of human
<br>
(and posthuman) evolution. Getting a feeling of deep time is healthy,
<br>
just as learning to enjoy the rush of change.
