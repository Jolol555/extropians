<em>&gt;  Just what Americans need - more reasons to be litigious.
</em><br>
<p>According to a Feb 1 article in the Los Angeles Times, &quot;We Aren't
<br>
Seeing You in Court&quot;, America's litigation levels have levelled off
<br>
and actually been falling in recent years, especially in California.
<br>
Furthermore, the so-called litigation explosion was actually not much of
<br>
an explosion after all.  The article is available in the Times archives
<br>
(with free registration) for another day or two.  Here are some excerpts:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America's litigation explosion has fizzled.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans are no longer suing each other as much.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Californians are suing each other much less.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After years of steady decline, the number of big-money personal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;injury lawsuits in California is roughly half of what it was a decade
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ago. Small claims have fallen to levels unseen in 30 years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;California may be a bit more precipitous,&quot; said University of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisconsin law professor Marc Galanter, an expert on lawsuit patterns,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;but this is the general picture in the United States.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Explosion' May Have Been Overstated
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably, that image has always been overblown. Legal scholars suggest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that only a small percentage of those who suffered injuries ever took
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their claims to court.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A massive study of the behavior of injured Americans in the late 1980s
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the Rand Corp.'s Institute for Civil Justice found that only 2%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of injured Americans sought compensation by filing lawsuits.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tort litigation &quot;explosion&quot; occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lawsuits increased by a little more than half, suggesting that 3%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those injured were filing them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was not a big event in the long lens of American
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history. Litigation rates were higher in colonial and pre-20th
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;century America than at the height of the modern &quot;explosion,&quot; said
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the University of Wisconsin's Galanter.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the &quot;explosion&quot; may have been perceived as bigger than it was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it followed a period of decline in lawsuits that began during
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Great Depression and continued through World War II and the postwar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recovery years. A law review article from that period reflected the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concern of some lawyers and judges that they might not have enough
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to do. It was titled: &quot;The Problem of Decreasing Litigation.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rand economist Stephen Carroll attributes the big slide here mainly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the long-term repercussions of a 1988 state Supreme Court decision
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that changed the rules under which injury lawsuits are brought.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That decision took away a powerful negotiating tool that plaintiffs'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attorneys had used to pry settlement offers out of insurers. The vast
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majority of lawsuits are settled before trial.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the high court acted, a plaintiff's attorney could bring a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lawsuit accusing an insurer of bad faith if the insurer failed to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make a reasonable settlement offer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high court took away that threat of punitive damages and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insurers were freer to make low-ball settlement offers or none at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all. Plaintiffs' attorneys, largely dependent on settlements for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their own incomes, may then have become choosier about which cases
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they filed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the high court decision, personal injury lawsuits filed annually
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in California Superior Courts fell over a decade from 132,000 to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70,000.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest subgroup of the lawsuits, involving motor vehicle injuries,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fell from 91,000 to 42,000 per year.
<br>
<p>You see, everything you know is wrong.
<br>
