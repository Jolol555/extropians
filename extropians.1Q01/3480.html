<br>
Being hit with a cream pie is no more terrorism than copying software
<br>
without permission is piracy. You're misusing the language, applying
<br>
hyperbolic terminology to trivia. What's next -- calling non-teetotalers
<br>
junkies and charging everyone who throws a punch in a bar when drunk with
<br>
attempted murder?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Throwing a pie is no better than slapping a person.
</em><br>
<p>It is considerably better than slapping someone. (I take it you've never
<br>
been on the receiving end of a cream pie. Speaking as someone who has,
<br>
I think you're taking yourself way too seriously.) The cream pie in the
<br>
face is basically a message: that the person delivering it thinks that
<br>
the person receiving it takes themselves *way* too seriously. Furthermore,
<br>
the cream pie in the face is almost never required when dealing with people
<br>
who enter into genuine dialogue. Look at the list of targets of the Belgian
<br>
tarteurs and you'll find po-faced self-important politicians, religious
<br>
leaders of the most bigoted stripe (whose statements are deemed to have
<br>
total authority, and brook no debate), and businessmen whose shady tactics
<br>
and unwillingness to engage in open debate are notorious.
<br>
<p>None of these characteristics are capital offenses, but they *do* deserve
<br>
a wake-up call, and if these guys aren't willing to put their reputation
<br>
on the line in even a symbolic manner, they should damn well stay out of
<br>
the public arena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construe such actions of attack as &quot;defusing&quot;?  They're clearly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended to strike out physically, which only leads to escalations - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and with a pie, there's the added insult of having a damned pie 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hanging off your face.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They are not, repeat not, a physical attack: they're an attack on the
<br>
dignity of the victim. Which is the whole point. 
<br>
<p>(Incidentally, seeing how a public person responds to being flanned by
<br>
surprise gives us more insight into their character than any number of
<br>
staged sound-bites. Prominent people aren't normally exposed to random 
<br>
public stimuli of a non-life-threatening but dignity-infringing variety 
<br>
on camera.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<br>
<em>&gt; Sure, if every homicidal loon substituted pies for their weapons, I'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be with you.  That would represent a reversing trend of violence in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world.
</em><br>
<p>No it wouldn't. 
<br>
<p>Believe it or not, the world is becoming a *less* violent place over
<br>
time. There are exceptions, but just about anywhere in the developed 
<br>
world -- yes, including gun-ridden and jail-crowded America -- you're
<br>
less likely to be assaulted or murdered than you would have been fifty
<br>
or a hundred years ago. 
<br>
<p>Part of our problem is that TV and news audiences like bad news -- it's
<br>
the same syndrome as the traffic jam crawling past the pile-up. People
<br>
like to rubberneck. So the news media have responded by going forth
<br>
and feeding us a diet of mayhem, and this makes us *feel* endangered,
<br>
even though our actual circumstances are anything but hazardous. It's
<br>
not aided by the war on drugs, which adds a lot of high-value commodities
<br>
and encourages violent and socially marginal types to engage in gang 
<br>
warfare over them. (Subtract the WoD and the high level of violence it
<br>
generates, and in most of the EU newspaper editors would be tearing 
<br>
their hair out looking for something to write about.)
<br>
<p>My general point, however, is that you are *safe*. The chances of an
<br>
army marching through your town, raping the women and stealing the cattle
<br>
and burning a few houses for fun, are about zip. The same goes for me,
<br>
too. Again: go back to the 1830's and English upper-class types went
<br>
armed in public because there was a very real probability of violence
<br>
if they didn't. The fact that the British government *can* ban handguns
<br>
is a pointer to the level of social change, and the marginalization of
<br>
violence in private life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  However, the little groups doing these pieings weren't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assassins anyway.  They were just doing standard protest stuff 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before,
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Standard protest stuff&quot; generally involves a bit more than
<br>
demonstrations.  It also covers trespassing, destruction of property,
<br>
assault, people chaining themselves to railings and throwing paint over
<br>
equipment owned by organisations they disapprove of, and a whole host
<br>
of other things. Compared to which, cream pies are actually a very
<br>
precisely targeted and relatively gentle hint.
<br>
<p>Believe me, the flan-in-the-face is trivial. If you want something to
<br>
worry about, go for the suicide bombers with a speed-boat full of 
<br>
explosives and a warm welcome awaiting them in paradise. Now, *they* are
<br>
dangerous!
