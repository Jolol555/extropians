<p>Hmm, I think I might do that for a while, too. Why, after all, if you can
<br>
afford &quot;limitless&quot; abundance through nanotech, is this actually a problem?
<br>
<p>Given this premise of providing a base for everyone at no cost, there's no
<br>
moral imperative for these people to behave in any particular way. May we
<br>
all do what we will.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that if you gave everyone in India who is starving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;limitless&quot; supply of food, you'd see a population explosion there of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unimaginable proportions.  How far will even miraculous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology be able to be stretched before we once again have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people starving?
</em><br>
<p>Depends on why people have kids. There is a strong argument that people in
<br>
conditions of third world poverty have big families, not because they are
<br>
mindless rabbits, but rather because it is a survival advantage in
<br>
conditions of such scarcity (because children rather quickly begin to
<br>
provide a net profit to the family unit). Going down that path, it seems
<br>
reasonable that the population growth would slow, rather than increase,
<br>
under conditions of abundance, and I think that's a common experience where
<br>
levels of wealth have increased in previously poor populations. Add
<br>
education, and you might hit zpg rather quickly. Well resourced &amp; educated
<br>
people tend not to breed all that much.
<br>
<p>So there's a pretty good solution to the population explosion. Get everyone
<br>
wealthy &amp; educated, and it takes care of itself. Well, after a bit of delay
<br>
anyway (say 50 years); admittedly that interim period promises more
<br>
immediate population problems...
