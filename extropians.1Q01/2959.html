<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Fortunately, I'm not a felon or violent felon, which were the types I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; was directing my comments toward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think felons, when they've paid their debt to society, and are back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paying taxes to society, they should get their vote back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have a problem, assuming they pass a citizenship test. I never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said they would have to have this permanently. This was a concept for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative to prison, a sort of mobile house arrest idea, where only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who prove their unfitness to live in a trust society must live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the rules of a 'transparent society'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, the current electronic monitoring devices that are used instead of prison
<br>
or as required by legal judgment, some of them are attached to the citzen like
<br>
a leg bracelet, then there is a device at that home or other location where the
<br>
citzen is required by law to stay.  None of them in any way affect the
<br>
citizen's health.
<br>
<p>These are a little different than electronic shock collars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My opposition to a transparent society is it automatically treats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone like felons. The technologies needed for a transparent society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be applied far easier to treating felons like felons and free people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like free people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have problems with &quot;transparent&quot; society also.  There is Supreme Court legal
<br>
precedent for the Right to Privacy (right to be left alone).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Many people here have children in various forms.  Some of them might get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; caught up in something when they turn 18 and be found guilty of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crime.  Noone here would ever accept your device being put on anyone they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; love.  What you have suggested is cruel and unusual punishment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not at all. Nobody would be in pain, while the stunner would be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either for instances where the wearer doesn't care about being observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. in a rage, etc) or at a low level to 'train' the felon into having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a concience via negative feedback. Far more humane than prison,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially for non-violent offenders, they wouldn't be exposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrigibles so much and would not be at risk of prison rape.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely negative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not being a felon nor draconian, you can call me &quot;Dragon.&quot;  If there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a live-or-die self-defense situation, I would kill my assailant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thus, if we had a pair of robots, one identical in physical characteristics to
<br>
me and the other to Lorrey, and we were able to sensorily inhabit those robots
<br>
while our bodies were safe, then the robots could fight to destruction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Somewhere, on the books, there is a law that you have broken.  Many laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be changed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No doubt on both counts. I have not, however, committed any felonies.
</em><br>
<p>I might have broken some drug laws.  I have not committed any &quot;non-consensual&quot;
<br>
physical act since childhood, more or less.  For example, in school, I used to
<br>
punch this friend sometimes, but not to the point where he wouldn't punch back.
