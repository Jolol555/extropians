<em>&gt; Max More wrote:   In an article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporting the declining position of the United States in world trade in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telecommunications equipment,
</em><br>
<p>Part of the problem might be that a long run of good times has
<br>
to a certain extent demotivated students.  Even the slouches
<br>
manage to find adequate employment.  We are to a certain
<br>
extent victims of our own success.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the New York Telephone Company reported that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;it tested 57,000 job applicants in 1987 and found that 54,900, or 96.3%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lacked basic skills in math, reading, and reasoning.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Right, but they are likely getting the bottom of the barrel applicants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (35) A human resource
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planning document prepared at the Bank of America in 1990 reported that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Chemical Bank in New York must interview 40 applicants to find one who can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be successfully trained as a teller&quot;;
</em><br>
<p>Again, the better qualified applicants are not looking to become
<br>
bank tellers.  Who aspires to compete with ATMs?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (36) &quot;at Pacific Bell in Los Angeles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 95% of the 3,500 people who recently took a competency test for entry-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs not requiring a high school education failed&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I would certainly agree that the US educational system is failing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Almost one-quarter of high school seniors could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurately determine the cost of a simple meal from a short menu of items
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and prices,(42) and fewer than half &quot;demonstrated a consistent grasp of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decimals, percents, fractions, and simple algebra.&quot;(43)
</em><br>
<p>This is an area that has long been debated.  Schools are being
<br>
required to teach additional skills in addition to the ones taught 30
<br>
yrs ago, such as computer competency.  The total amount of
<br>
time in class has not changed.  So what should be dropped off
<br>
of the curriculum?  The most common thing has been math
<br>
skills, with the notion that having computer skills will somehow
<br>
compensate for the loss.  What isnt fully understood is that the
<br>
study of mathematics trains the mind in logic and clear thinking.
<br>
<p>Max, being an educator, this must cause you countless
<br>
headaches, eh?  spike
