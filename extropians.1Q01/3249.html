</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is my Yopy PDA, from Samsung Electronics.  It has a 200 Mhz ARM processor, 32 MB of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; storage and 16MB of memory.  It's color, with a touch screen and stylus, and game buttons. It's the same size as a Palm, maybe thicker.  It came through Customs last week.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Here is the web site <a href="http://www.gmate.co.kr/">http://www.gmate.co.kr/</a>.  
</em><br>
<p>I'm wondering if anyone has tried using QNX for a PDA OS. THe OS with
<br>
browser and other utilities all fits on a 1.44 floppy and boots on my
<br>
PCs and linux boxes just dandy.
<br>
See www.qnx.com for info if you haven't seen this before.
