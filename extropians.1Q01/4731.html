<br>
<p><em>&gt;As an aside, consider the following. Typically, the pure sciences and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematics don't pay as well as law and medicine, and tend to have a lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;status in society.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree about the 'lower status in society' in the societies
<br>
where I've lived. I think the words: 'different status' or 'unique
<br>
status' might be more appropriate. I agree with your assessment
<br>
about the money earnings, however.
<br>
<p>So of the countries that I know about-
<br>
<p>I know that in Poland the bus drivers make more money than PhD
<br>
astrophysics researchers- there's something very wrong IMO about the
<br>
science earnings and status in that society. Hungary and the Czech
<br>
Republic and Romania and Baltic countries are better as far as the
<br>
&quot;status&quot; part goes, but the earning power in those societes is bleak.
<br>
(economically those countries have some ways to go)
<br>
<p>In the US, I was earning more as a scientific programmer in my
<br>
government (NASA) lab than the post-docs at the same place, who had
<br>
more formal scientific training.
<br>
<p>Germany is interesting ... people seem to be leaving the sciences
<br>
in droves (simply my subjective opinion) and headed towards the
<br>
businesses because of the money lure. The societal status of
<br>
scientists is fairly good here, but money doesn't follow. The
<br>
scientists I know are not poor, but there is not anyone who is
<br>
wealthy either.
<br>
<p>Maybe a useful note: every astronomer I know is in the astronomy
<br>
field because they love the work and not for the money (take an
<br>
astronomer to lunch, please). Another note: the astronomers whom I
<br>
know that have left the field because of the money lure, later
<br>
regretted it. As a point of reference: I cut my monthly earnings by
<br>
about 2/3 in order to go for my astrophysics PhD. I have no
<br>
illusions of big money in the coming years either, and that
<br>
honestly doesn't bother me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As a living, physics and math just don't cut it.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.. Supporting one.. looks OK to me. Supporting more
<br>
than one person.. well.. could be a problem. Some high-paying
<br>
consultant work on the side would be beneficial (!).
<br>
<p>Everyone needs to assess for themselves the &quot;money value&quot; compared
<br>
to the &quot;joy value&quot; of one's work-life, don't you think?
