I found a good resource for economic analysis of the California
<br>
electrical power crisis.  It is the UC Energy Institute at Berkeley,
<br>
<a href="http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/">http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/</a>.  Their working paper #074, from
<br>
February, 2000, presciently describes the difficulties facing electrical
<br>
markets in periods of shortages:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of very inelastic short-run demand and supply (at peak
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times) with the real-time nature of the market (costly storage and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grid reliability requirements) make electricity markets especially
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vulnerable to the exercise of market power.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see why this is the case, think about the dreadful summer afternoon
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the temperature and humidity are at peak levels and the grid needs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtually all resources in production in order to meet the tremendous
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demand for electricity to run air conditioning units. If the grid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has only a few percent margin of reserve capacity at that time and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a producer that is supplying more the a few percent of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total output, then that producer is pivotal in meeting the demand. Put
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differently, that producer can ask for an extremely high price in order
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deliver the power and consumers--more specifically the local utility
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that represents them in the wholesale power market--will pay it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most markets, there are other constraints that keep a single firm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a fairly small percentage of production from driving up the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;price by a large amount. If the good is storable, then the buyers,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or marketers in the middle, can store product to defend against such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vulnerability. If end-use consumers receive the price information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before buying, then their own hesitancy to pay extreme prices
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discourages the seller from asking such a price. If there is supply
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elasticity, then one firm demanding a high price for its output will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just shift market share to another supplier. Each of these attributes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is much less prevalent in electricity markets than in nearly any other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;industry. The result is that the ability of firms with even modest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market shares to exercise market power is greater than in most markets.
<br>
<p>Other papers in the series present evidence of market power (price
<br>
manipulation beyond competitive levels) in the detailed data available on
<br>
the California markets.  They also offer some remedies, including price
<br>
stability through futures markets, and increased use of real-time pricing
<br>
(which requires special electric meters which report hourly use).
<br>
<p>The one I quoted above concludes, &quot;The movement towards less regulation
<br>
and more reliance upon market processes in the electricity industry has
<br>
enormous potential benefits, and also potential risks. A move toward
<br>
deregulation that does not take the issue of market power seriously can
<br>
undermine the goals of industry restructuring and even, as in the case
<br>
of England, produce a regulatory backlash.&quot;  Unfortunately it appears
<br>
that this prediction is being borne out very accurately.
