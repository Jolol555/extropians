<br>
<p><p>The job has taken a beating in recent years--it appears to have been
<br>
one of the major casualties of the corporate restructuring which swept
<br>
through the U.S. economy in the early 1990s. Most Americans know
<br>
someone whose position has been downsized or outsourced, and a series
<br>
of high-profile articles in prominent publications have suggested that
<br>
&quot;good&quot; jobs--those offering health insurance and a pension, along with
<br>
a prospect for advancement--are increasingly relics of the past.[1]
<br>
<p>This attention has been spurred by the rapid increase in the use of
<br>
temporary employees--the number of positions filled by temporary
<br>
agencies more than doubled during the first half of the 1990s--and by
<br>
many highly-visible instances of corporate downsizing and
<br>
outsourcing.[2] In fast-growing, knowledge-intensive sectors of the
<br>
economy, such as high technology and entertainment, skilled workers
<br>
increasingly operate outside the framework of traditional jobs
<br>
altogether. Instead they work as independent contractors, establishing
<br>
ongoing relationships with a number of different firms.[3]
<br>
<p>Many observers believe that highly flexible organizational
<br>
forms--often called networked organizations or virtual
<br>
corporations--will become increasingly common in the future. In our
<br>
research at MIT, for example, we have examined scenarios in which
<br>
temporary networks of very small companies and independent contractors
<br>
could undertake much of the work that is performed by large
<br>
organizations today.[4]
<br>
<p>In many situations, these new ways of working result in much greater
<br>
economic efficiency and flexibility. But what about the individuals in
<br>
these flexible networks? Where will they go to fulfill the human needs
<br>
that are satisfied today by large organizations? How, for instance,
<br>
will they find financial security? Who will provide for their health
<br>
care and retirement? Will they be lonely, working all day with their
<br>
customers and suppliers, but never with colleagues?
<br>
<p>The current conversation on these issues is highly polarized. One
<br>
viewpoint, espoused by much of the business press and many
<br>
conservative politicians, focuses on the benefits of flexible work
<br>
arrangements, while de-emphasizing their human costs. The other
<br>
stance, favored by many union leaders and liberal politicians,
<br>
emphasizes the human costs, without acknowledging that the new
<br>
arrangements are often more productive ways of organizing work.
<br>
<p>Once we began thinking about these questions, we realized that there
<br>
was an obvious--but not widely appreciated--possibility for answering
<br>
them. What if, rather than relying on an employer or the government to
<br>
meet their human needs, individual workers joined independent
<br>
organizations whose primary purpose was to provide stable &quot;homes&quot; as
<br>
they moved from job to job? We call these organizations &quot;guilds&quot; by
<br>
analogy to the craft associations of the Middle Ages, and in this
<br>
paper we examine what they might do and how they might emerge.
