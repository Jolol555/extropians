<p><em>&gt; It's one thing to talk about the future of the West, about

</em><br>
<p>True, with the following comments:
<br>
<p>- Whatever needs to be done, once someone has done it, it is a lot easier
<br>
for others to follow. Example paves the way. It will be easier to show the
<br>
eastern guys that our lifestyle is good once it is *actually* good. At this
<br>
time, many of those eastern guys might argue that they have nothing to learn
<br>
from the western civilization: &quot;Just look at yourself, what do you do all
<br>
day? Sure you're clean, sure you've got gadgets, but how are you any more
<br>
happy than we are?&quot;
<br>
<p>- If you manage to motivate those eastern guys by example, by showing them
<br>
that we have achieved something that they really desire, then, once people
<br>
are motivated, the road need not be long at all. Laws of slow change apply
<br>
to an idle, non-motivated society. I think that if you managed to show all
<br>
of India something that would motivate all of them to strive towards a goal,
<br>
you would be able to have them get there very quickly. [Or so I think.] Just
<br>
compare this to conductors: you can't nearly put as much power through a
<br>
semiconductor as you can through a superconductor. Yet the difference is
<br>
primarily in the internal order within the material.
<br>
<p>The reason I am saying this is because some people tend to have a
<br>
'perfectionist' approach: let's make sure everything is nice and correct
<br>
right now, and then we'll figure out what to do next. &quot;Let's not go to Mars
<br>
until we have Earth figured out.&quot; I think that's the wrong approach; by the
<br>
time we have Earth figured out, it might be too late.
<br>
<p>I think a good way forward is to devote a substantial amount of resources
<br>
into trying to figure out what to do next *before* you have everything set
<br>
up nice and correctly, because knowledge of what comes next might render
<br>
your current knowledge obsolete.
