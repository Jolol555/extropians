<em>&gt; &gt; There are a lot of good coders / IT people on this list. The best
</em><br>
evidence
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is when someone asks a computer related question; the barrage of
</em><br>
responses
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is quite overwhelming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I bet it's boring as batshit for those who don't earn a crust this way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've often wanted to ask tech questions on list, but hesitated because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that's not the list's purpose. I'm going out on a limb and assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is possibly not an uncommon experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should we (or someone) start an Extro IT self help list? So that all us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; geekazoids can gather round, share knowledge, and beat each other over
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; head on fine points of technical dogma? It'd be fun, and probably damned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I don't think so.  Some of the tech stuff on here is what makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list interesting and lively.  I don't see anyone being offended by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it in any case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's because we don't talk the talk all that much. Trust me, that can
<br>
really piss people off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The other thing this list is good at is answering science-related
</em><br>
questions.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As an idea for positive PR, has anyone considered starting a website for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answering technical/science related questions, possibly aimed at
</em><br>
younguns? A
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lot of young people have questions to ask, and the people hereabouts
</em><br>
answer
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such questions in not only informative, but fairly entertaining ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Such a site could be an amalgam of website based forum &amp; mailing list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (giving people the opportunity to access it in either style), and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; involve giving answers on a strictly voluntary basis (much as happens
</em><br>
here
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; already). Think of it as a service to the community, and an excellent
</em><br>
way to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increase exposure of extropian ideas which, after all, are supposed to
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; driven by facts and reasonable predictions. The most common experience
</em><br>
here
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that people come to &gt;H ideas by processing the information available
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them in their environment, and seek out Transhumanism or Extropianism
</em><br>
after
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are already converts. So, to spread the word, we would be best
</em><br>
served
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in spreading information. And my bet is that the most likely demographic
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adopt these ideas of an amazingly changed future are young people; those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without much attachment to the way things are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why nail down the technical form of the list early?  Such a list is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea but there are already broad efforts to do this type of thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is another needed?  Does it necessarily have to do with Extropians?  Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it a front for pulling people in?  If so then it seem a bit less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honest.  Now an extropian outreach to the young (or young of mind &lt;g&gt;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems reasonable enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, it could be a (visibly) Exi-institute backed site. As to technical
<br>
form, that was just a suggestion.
<br>
<p>As to whether another science q&amp;a site/forum/list is needed, hell yes! Take
<br>
this bit from Greg Burch's criticism of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon:
<br>
<p>Once again, we see the considerable talents of the pop culture machine
<br>
invested in creating deceptive, seductive nonsense that divorces us from the
<br>
real past and the real world, when the real past and the real world offer
<br>
wonders aplenty.
<br>
<p>This got me thinking... Greg was talking about the dumbing down of western
<br>
culture through uncritical use of supernatural influnces. The world is awash
<br>
in mumbo-jumbo. A couple of days ago, for instance, I discovered that most
<br>
of the parents I know in the local area, of kids who go to the same school
<br>
as my daughter, don't have their kids immunised. The reason? Lots of rubbish
<br>
about the body healing itself, putting disease into children is tantamount
<br>
to child abuse, all sorts of crap. The same people are heavily influences by
<br>
whatever faddish &quot;alternative&quot; nonsense is doing the rounds (nlp today, I
<br>
believe).
<br>
<p>Talking about science is talking about verifiable stuff, as opposed to sheer
<br>
crap. Doing a bit more of that, in an accessible way, that would be a
<br>
worthwhile thing.
