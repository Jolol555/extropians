<em>&gt; It's one thing to to note that many of today's video games for the

<em>&gt; personal computer are violent or depict violence.  That's the market,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telling us that those are the titles that sell.  Perhaps that's because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the audience is mostly male.  For example, there are approx. 80,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; users of the Red Alert 2 online interactive game since it's introduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two months ago who actually play the game against other live people over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Internet..  It's a combat simulation game, a &quot;real-time strategy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game.  Currently, I actually play the game myself enough to have a rank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of about 400, as they keep a massive ladder of all the battles.  From
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sampling conversation, I think most of the people that play are five
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years younger than me, and some older and younger.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I've played that game some more and been able to increase my rank
<br>
among players of that game to 250.  That is good, because even one loss at
<br>
that level can reduce the rank several hundred places.  The system matches
<br>
players so that they play other players at some level near their own, so it
<br>
is competitive in the sense that to reach higher ranks you must outperform
<br>
your peers, not the general population, as the population is large.
<br>
<p>That video game is based on a theme of a World War II type setting in an
<br>
alternate historical universe.
<br>
<p>So it's a fun game and I should give the disks away.
