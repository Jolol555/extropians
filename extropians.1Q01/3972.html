I took a trip to PETA's website (which is pretty and very nicely done) but
<br>
couldn't find a single instance of an alternative use of the lives of
<br>
domesticated animals.  Should we let them go free?  I seem to remember a
<br>
story about a group of eco-terrorists in France who released a whole bunch
<br>
of minks (or similar critter) from a fur farm.  The poor things promptly ran
<br>
away right into traffic where a bunch were killed.  Can you imagine what
<br>
would happen if we set pigs free to roam the forrests?
<br>
<p>Aside from pictures of pretty celebrities telling us to keep away from
<br>
leather, I didn't see much of anything substantive.  I'm not particularly
<br>
comfortable with having to kill other creatures for food and clothing - I'd
<br>
much rather get that from nano-Santa - but I can't see any humane
<br>
alternatives.  Of course, come to think of it, Nano-Santa will probably
<br>
spell the end of domesticated animals as well, except perhaps as zoo
<br>
curiosities - &quot;Look mommy!  A *cow*!!!!! Wow!&quot;  &quot;Yes, Billy, we used to kill
<br>
those and then eat and wear their flesh...&quot;  &quot;Ewwwww, mommy, that's gross!&quot;
<br>
<p>Why spend resources on something that you don't need?
<br>
<p>Poor cows and pigs and goats and chickens.  I'll miss you all!  *sob*
<br>
<p>Next Mission:  Get Alicia Silverstone and Prince to do PR for Zyvex!
<br>
Mwuhahahahahaha!

<em>&gt; You're not the only person to point this out. A Burlington, VT school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principal got in hot water recently with parents and the local dairy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry when she caved into the demand of ONE PETA member demanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal space to put posters next to the 'Got Milk?' posters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that detailed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the alleged health problems associated with milk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption (while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curiously not mentioning all of the health problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of dairy consumption). Rather than put up the PETA posters, the school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; board originally decided to take all the posters down, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Governor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got into the act, who told PETA to stuff it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PETA is for the genocide of domesticated animals of all kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (individual members may not take it that far, but that is the party
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line).
