<p>You've made an interesting point here. It's very arguable (and probably even
<br>
provable) that much harm has been done in the name of such lofty concepts as
<br>
morality, ethics, altruism, etc. And certainly it is at least arrogant to
<br>
assume we have entirely overcome our natural instincts (or &quot;human nature,&quot; or
<br>
whatever we want to call it). I think an honest recognition of our biological
<br>
and genetic heritage is necessary if we are to improve ourselves, but the
<br>
conceptual tools we have at our disposal (and the many new ones we will
<br>
invent) are powerful and capable enough to do the job when handled with
<br>
balance and wisdom. I would be the first to admit we have a long way to go,
<br>
but am also optimistic enough to think we can accomplish whatever we set our
<br>
minds to.
<br>
<p>I read Ishmael a couple of years ago and thought some of his ideas were
<br>
compelling, but that his overall application of them to history was overly
<br>
romantic and greatly flawed. He had some good insights, but IMHO failed to
<br>
understand the larger picture. But I could be wrong.
