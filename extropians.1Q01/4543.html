<p>It seems like I've heard about this being noted by astronomers.  The
<br>
moon is brighter at full moon than what you would predict if you had
<br>
uniform reflectance in all directions.
<br>
<p>According to <a href="http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a11387.html">http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a11387.html</a>, &quot;The Full
<br>
Moon is about a factor of 10 times brighter than the Half Moon phase.&quot;
<br>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.hockey.net/~wb0bwl/tom/paper/old/magnitud.htm">http://www.hockey.net/~wb0bwl/tom/paper/old/magnitud.htm</a>,
<br>
after several pages of calculus assuming &quot;the surface brightness appears
<br>
the same for any direction relative to the surface normal&quot;, we find,
<br>
&quot;One interesting thing I found that comes out of this is that the phase
<br>
factor is 1 for full phase and 1/pi for quarter phase which means the
<br>
planet is over 3 times brighter when it is full compared to half full.&quot;
<br>
<p>So according to this calculation (which I didn't try to verify),
<br>
uniform reflectance predicts that a full moon will be pi times as bright
<br>
as a half moon, while observations show a much larger factor of 10.
<br>
This would suggest that the moon's surface does preferentially reflect
<br>
light back in the direction it shines from, since during a full moon we
<br>
are looking at the moon from the same direction as the sun.
