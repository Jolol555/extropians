<em>&gt; Huh?  I don't know of a single State that requires citizenship to purchase

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ok, I probably got bamboozled by 'conventional wisdom' here. I do know
<br>
that in Massachusetts this is the case (Sasha was not permitted to buy
<br>
guns), but as said by others, Mass is a lost cause. I was under the
<br>
impression that the various and many 'anti-terrorist' acts passed in the
<br>
last decade had tightened up most of the processes for non-citizens to
<br>
legally own or carry guns, and the Brady Act paperwork does specifically
<br>
ask residency/citizenship status, a wrong answer meaning instant
<br>
rejection.
<br>
<p>Now, to prove residency, you need a state ID, for which you have to
<br>
provide some legal residency papers (not necessarily a working green
<br>
card). Frankly I find the idea that I can't buy a gun in a state I'm not
<br>
resident in unless I have them ship them to a dealer in my home state
<br>
(and if the gun is legally purchasable in my home state), while a
<br>
non-citizen can come in and buy to be totally ludicrous.
