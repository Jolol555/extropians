Let's look at the situation of cows, pigs, etc from the selfish-gene point 
<br>
of view, which seems to me is the most appropriate. In ants, bees and 
<br>
termites only the queens pass on their genes, but that is not a problem, as 
<br>
all ants in a colony share the same genome and are indirectly spreading it 
<br>
by working for the success of the colony. Farm animals are in a similar 
<br>
situation, the only difference being that the &quot;queens&quot; are handpicked by 
<br>
humans. These species have lost control over their evolution (they would not 
<br>
look like they do today without human intervention), but they achieved 
<br>
otherwise impossible success in terms of numbers and geographical spread - 
<br>
let's face it: they have hitched the ride of their evolutionary life on the 
<br>
back of a more successfull species! The fact that they are slaughtered for 
<br>
meat makes no difference, as it also happens in the wild (and in a nastier 
<br>
way, too - typically by being eaten alive by a pack of dog-like creatures).
<br>
<p>The problem with this, of course, it's that it's not as easy a message as 
<br>
that of PETA to communicate... that's the problem with science!
