<em>&gt;I heard the definition of philosophy as &quot;the art of asking the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions&quot; it seemed to me an accurate description. (In case you didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know it, my favorite definition of philosophy is a take-off on Abraham
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Joshua Keschel's definition... &quot;Philosophy may be defined as the art of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asking the right questions...&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>For the first time, I realize that this entire thread was meant to be a joke.
<br>
This was never a usable definition, it was always a humorous punch-line.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; For a proper definition, you need to expand on what makes a question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;wrong&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, that would be philosophical... and a waste of time.
</em><br>
<p>And I realize that your answers are supposed to be humorous by being 
<br>
deliberately circular.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Everyone knows what wrong means, but philosophy attempts to prove the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incredible by an appeal to the unintelligible.
</em><br>
<p>You deliberately kept the conversation by being non-responsive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;official definition (of course) comes from Ambrose Bierce: &quot;Philosophy, n.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A route of many roads leading from nowhere to nothing.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Another joke.  Perhaps you should investigate a concept known as smiley-faces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It seems to me you're asking the wrong questions. That's OK, you're an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accomplished philosopher.
</em><br>
<p>I am not an accomplished philosopher.  I seriously was trying to 
<br>
figure out what your content-free postings were trying to say. 
<br>
That's OK, you're an accomplished troll.  You are now in my kill-file 
<br>
with other trolls.
