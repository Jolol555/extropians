Your position rests, though, on one key principle: that absolutely
<br>
nobody can be trusted. I think the fact that most intelligence analysts
<br>
will admit that at least one if not more nuclear weapons may be already
<br>
in the hands of one or more terrorist groups, yet they have not been
<br>
used is a pretty good indicator that even the most extreme individuals
<br>
can still have the capacity to retain some sanity in their judgement.
<br>
The mere fact that the russians, chinese, cubans, and others have had
<br>
them and not used them is a pretty good indicator that most people are
<br>
pretty good at being responsible with such power. Accidents do happen,
<br>
no doubt, however you have not shown any indications that advanced
<br>
nanotech would be as uncontrollable as you claim. You have no evidence
<br>
(nor, IMHO, any knowledged to judge) that any accidents would not be
<br>
containable.
