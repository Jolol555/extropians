</em><br>
<p>It's true! Under Soviet socialism, but not US capitalism, you could very 
<br>
quickly move from a comfortable existence as a Kulak to sudden death. You 
<br>
could move quickly from privileged member of the Communist Party to 
<br>
Siberia, if you said the wrong thing, knew the wrong people, or if Stalin 
<br>
had a bad day.
<br>
<p>The figures for social mobility anywhere are suspect, unless they give 
<br>
dynamic rather than static data. (This has often not been the case.) The 
<br>
overall composition might look static if about the same percentage remain 
<br>
in specified groups, but you may find that the individual in those groups 
<br>
change greatly over time. Contrary to what you suggest here, I believe this 
<br>
is often the case in the US. I've seen studies to this effect, but cannot 
<br>
remember where either!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Another relatively random point; did anyone notice the recent article on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NYT, which talked about the fact that over the last decade (?), the major
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trend in employees has been in moving back to large organisations, and out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of risky smaller ventures and self employment, contrary to popular opinion?
</em><br>
<p>Funny, again my understanding is the opposite. The figures I've seen quite 
<br>
recently showed that a declining number of people are employed by large 
<br>
companies, more people are consultants or self-employed or work for smaller 
<br>
companies, *even though* the share of economic output attributed to large 
<br>
companies has increased.
<br>
<p>Alas, I don't have those figures or studies at hand. So take my impressions 
<br>
for what they're worth.
