<p>Prisons are sad.  Imprisoning each of the 2 million prisoners costs American
<br>
taxpayers about 60,000 a year each, not to mention prison construction and
<br>
labor costs.  Two million times 60,000 is 120,000,000,000 dollars a year.
<br>
Maybe the cost per prisoner is actually only 15,000 dollars a year, which it
<br>
is not, then it would cost thirty billion dollars, a year.  Perhaps these
<br>
numbers are lower and higher, but they are illustrative.
<br>
<p>American has the highest rate of imprisonment of any democratic country, which
<br>
is absolutely pathetic.  Even ninety-nine percent of extremely violent
<br>
offenders are not violent ninety-nine percent of the time.
<br>
<p>Not having been imprisoned, I wouldn't want to be.  Not being a criminal, I
<br>
see less reason to imprison anyone.
<br>
<p>When I was a high school student, the debate topic for the year was prison
<br>
overcrowding, and how to resolve it.  Plans included decriminalizing drugs.
<br>
We argued for the complete year the entire issue of prisons.  The other annual
<br>
debate topics were space and the elderly.
<br>
<p>Sometimes this list talks about &quot;transparency&quot;, where for example public
<br>
cameras help deter crime.  Here's how it should be, all the on-duty cops and
<br>
prison guards are videotaped regularly, and only them, as it can be expected
<br>
that they would be in the vicinity of crime reports.  This video wouldn't be
<br>
available to the general public, nor any other public or private entity, but
<br>
it would be available to any court proceeding.
