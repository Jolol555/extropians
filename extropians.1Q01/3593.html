Hey, I'm with you on this one.  Humour can be one of the best ways of 
<br>
getting an idea across also.  The day we get too serious is the day were on 
<br>
the downward spiral into stagnation.
<br>
<p>Oh, and no one responded to my Neutron joke.  I'm a two-bit comedian, and I 
<br>
demand an audience, damnit!!:)
<br>
<p>Regards,

<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
