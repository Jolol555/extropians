</em><br>
<p>This statement seems rather simplistic to me.
<br>
<p>Incest: wasn't a taboo in Europe's aristocracy for a long long time. [Now
<br>
that we have birth control and adoption, I don't see why it should remain
<br>
taboo either.]
<br>
<p>Murder: different groups of people have quite different conceptions about
<br>
which kinds of homicide constitute murder and which do not. [Countries with
<br>
capital punishment vs. countries without it seem like the most innocent
<br>
example, but there are probably more examples - whoever said something about
<br>
Iceland(?) and how they only interpreted homicide as murder if it wasn't
<br>
reported to neighbors?]
<br>
<p>Paedophilia: see one of my earlier messages regarding Greeks.
<br>
<p>There are probably more examples like this; if there is a historian or an
<br>
expert in cultures on this list, they will be best equipped to comment on
<br>
this issue.
