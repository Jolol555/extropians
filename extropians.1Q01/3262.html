<p>This is not true.  When I was 20, I used to teach computer seminars 
<br>
at my company's Ft. Lauderdale division every weekend for a while.  I 
<br>
looked younger for my age.  I was driving a Trans Am, wearing a suit, 
<br>
with a briefcase in the passenger seat, and kept under the speed 
<br>
limit driving down I-95 on weekends.  I fit many of the profiling 
<br>
attributes of a young drug dealer.  As such, I was stopped and 
<br>
searched on most trips.  They would go through my checkbook, my 
<br>
briefcase, my cell-phone, everything.   I tried giving them 
<br>
permission to search, I tried denying them permission to search, but 
<br>
nothing worked.  You might think that they might learn to recognize 
<br>
me, but this made it even worse, when one of the cops would remember 
<br>
having stopped me on suspicion on previous occasions.  I have even 
<br>
had guns drawn on me once when I said that I would not consent to a 
<br>
search.  Being law abiding offers no protection from the police.
