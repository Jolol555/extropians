Fred Hapgood has a number of wonderful articles on his website at

<a href="http://world.std.com/~fhapgood/">http://world.std.com/~fhapgood/</a>.  Be sure to check out
<br>
Underground Montreal at
<br>
<a href="http://world.std.com/~fhapgood/texts/montreal.htm">http://world.std.com/~fhapgood/texts/montreal.htm</a>.   What follows is the
<br>
text of a presentation he made to the Digital Commerce Society of
<br>
Boston  on September 5, 2000
<br>
<p>You can find the original here:  <a href="http://tipster.weblogs.com/hapgood">http://tipster.weblogs.com/hapgood</a>,
<br>
another website I recommend.
<br>
<p>We are discussing here today mechanisms that would allow
<br>
small payments to be made on a quasi-automated, highly
<br>
configurable, and entirely voluntary basis to any
<br>
desired individual or organization.
<br>
<p>While such a system would have many applications, our
<br>
immediate interest is sending money directly to artists
<br>
as 'applause' for their works: for instance, to flip
<br>
Elastica a dime whenever I download or play their hit
<br>
'Connection', or to parcel a set amount across the
<br>
accounts of all the musicians I listen to in a given
<br>
month, or whatever. There are many alternatives, which
<br>
is one of the charms of the system.
<br>
<p>Voluntary payments are not inherently radical, since in
<br>
theory they might do nothing more than supplement the
<br>
current revenue structure. However, some think such
<br>
payments might actually replace the present IP
<br>
(intellectual property) revenue system, at least for
<br>
some media. Technological changes might so undermine the
<br>
present system as to make it necessary to find an
<br>
alternative for the revenue and services the current
<br>
model pays out, directly and indirectly, to
<br>
artists. Others feel that the current system has drifted
<br>
so far out of synch with the relationship society wants
<br>
and needs to have with its artists that it needs to be
<br>
replaced with something better, entirely apart from the
<br>
technological or business issues. In this view,
<br>
voluntary payments would be that something better,
<br>
establishing a more sensitive, responsive, and intimate
<br>
relationship with our artists. Some of us hold both
<br>
opinions.
<br>
<p>There is no doubt that Big Copyright seems to be dying,
<br>
though it is dying hard. Already staggering from the
<br>
effect of simple client- server filesharing, the
<br>
copyright industries got another serious whack last year
<br>
from a new style of networking, called peer-to-peer. The
<br>
idea behind P2P is that any machine or group of machines
<br>
can perform any function or supply any resource for any
<br>
other user or group of users. I can store material for
<br>
you; you can do processing for me. Any random group of
<br>
machines can combine to form their own online service,
<br>
their own AOL, independent of who owns those machines.
<br>
<p>As Napster shows, P2P is reasonably compatible with the
<br>
technological environment now. Down the road a bit (like
<br>
a year or two) the spread of broadband, with its
<br>
continuous connections and faster file transfers, plus
<br>
other tweaks like file streaming, will make the
<br>
technology even more attractive. If you think we are
<br>
moving into a world in which your net connections will
<br>
be mediated through and over many different devices,
<br>
then being able to generate integrated catalogs for all
<br>
the media types (family videos, recipes, gene sequences,
<br>
galaxy profiles) residing on every relevant device, from
<br>
workstations to Palm Pilots, is close to a necessity.
<br>
<p>The international reach of Napster hides an interesting
<br>
feature of P2P networks, which is that their usefulness
<br>
both accelerates and saturates rapidly. Imagine that you
<br>
wanted to build a P2P blues catalog. You start by asking
<br>
your friends, who ask their friends, etc. The first few
<br>
dozen members might bring in several hundred tracks,
<br>
giving you an integrated library larger than any but the
<br>
very largest blues archives. Members added after this
<br>
point might add an average of one or two new files. Once
<br>
you got to a network of a few hundred, or at most a
<br>
thousand or two, you might need to add ten or twenty
<br>
members to get one new track. At that point there is no
<br>
incentive to build the network any larger.
<br>
<p>Indeed, to the contrary: P2P networks have many reasons
<br>
for wanting to stay small. A network built up out a few
<br>
hundred trusted nodes -- the friends and family of
<br>
members of the Boston Blues Lovers Society -- would be a
<br>
lot safer and more secure than a file server sitting on
<br>
the current internet and exposed to the whole
<br>
world. There would be less exposure to marketing
<br>
messages, hackers and other mischief-makers, and anti-
<br>
piracy cops alike. Students have lots of ways to deal
<br>
with the anti- Napster access restrictions colleges are
<br>
imposing, but perhaps the simplest is to build a P2P
<br>
network that never even asks to get past the college
<br>
firewall. A catalog combining the archives of the
<br>
residents of a single dorm would probably be able to
<br>
deal with 99% of the requests put to it by other
<br>
students at that college.
<br>
<p>The challenge systems like these present to business
<br>
models organized around control of copyright is quite
<br>
general. While music, films, and books are perhaps most
<br>
vulnerable, there seems to be no reason why pay- per-
<br>
view and subscription cable won't go down the same
<br>
drain, as software spreads that allows users to
<br>
redistribute the signals coming out of the audio and
<br>
video jacks of their televisions. Even paid admission to
<br>
live performances might suffer some loss of revenue to
<br>
customers 'broadcasting' their shows with wireless
<br>
videocams, though obviously no technology in our
<br>
lifetimes is going to fully replace the electricity of
<br>
live events.
<br>
<p>The only category of content that is even somewhat
<br>
piracy proof is interactive media; media that offers a
<br>
variety of paths through an experience. Any one path can
<br>
be recorded and distributed, but the freedom to choose a
<br>
path cannot. While most interactive experiences rely on
<br>
physical presence (listening to one's sounds mingle with
<br>
those of the audience, doing the wave, talking with
<br>
whoever happens to be in the next seat), online
<br>
analogies are not too hard to imagine. A viewer might be
<br>
able to wander (virtually speaking) through any path in
<br>
a concert hall or even through the scenes in a
<br>
movie. (However, note that given enough processing
<br>
intelligence even quite complex interactive experiences
<br>
could be pirateable, since a very smart computer would
<br>
be able to figure out the domain well enough to predict
<br>
these experiences.)
<br>
<p>We sometimes hear that the present system can adapt by
<br>
out- Napstering Napster -- building a huge catalog that
<br>
would match the convenience of P2P catalogs and then
<br>
selling encrypted downloads out of this database. This
<br>
is the 'getting it' option.  Consultants and analysts
<br>
are peddling it from every corner. I have serious
<br>
doubts. An official metacatalog raises huge antitrust,
<br>
channel conflict, and institutional culture hurdles. I
<br>
have no concept of what would be involved with getting
<br>
the rights required to build such a huge base, but they
<br>
would be very complex, which is to say expensive.
<br>
<p>But leaving all that to one side, an official site will
<br>
probably not be able to run in P2P mode. The companies
<br>
would be unlikely to trust us enough to want to be
<br>
dependent on our resources, and we are not likely to
<br>
want to let them do so even if they did. An RIAA Napster
<br>
will have to buy its own storage and bandwidth, both of
<br>
which it will need a lot of to be competitively
<br>
convenient. All these difficulties suggest it will be
<br>
very hard for an &quot;official Napster&quot; to keep its prices
<br>
low enough to compete with the unofficial libraries that
<br>
are bound to be running everywhere on the net. The
<br>
industry might try to use their lawyers to drive P2P
<br>
networks out of existence, but a networking culture
<br>
built out of hundreds of thousands of catalogs would be
<br>
very difficult to bring to heel.
<br>
<p>This story is formidable enough, but there is a second
<br>
problem that has nothing to do with technology: there
<br>
can be no understating the effect of the developing
<br>
impatience of the culture at large with copyrights,
<br>
especially as they relate to music. First, sharing --
<br>
exchanging reactions to experiences held in common --
<br>
lies at the core of what culture is. If the world has
<br>
changed in such a way that copyright and simple, cheap,
<br>
sharing cannot co-exist (and the forces of Big Copyright
<br>
agree with me on this, if nothing else) then copyright
<br>
has to give way.
<br>
<p>Second, revenue models organized around copyright
<br>
naturally have very low marginal costs. Once the
<br>
production or publishing costs are paid, the cost of
<br>
printing one extra book or stamping out one more CD is
<br>
very low. Such industries naturally want to base their
<br>
sales on the smallest possible number of discrete
<br>
products (titles) so as to enjoy the most favorable
<br>
economies of scale. As the sector develops, copyright
<br>
businesses naturally become blockbuster-seeking; they
<br>
look for products that favor large homogeneous
<br>
constituencies that respond in a disciplined way to a
<br>
drumbeat of cheap, low- bandwidth, promotion
<br>
messages. These are of course are fine people whose
<br>
needs should be met, but they are not the whole culture.
<br>
<p>Finally, it seems critical to a culture that audiences
<br>
communicate their responses to artists, and to do so in
<br>
way that is as finely- tuned as possible. Audiences have
<br>
to be able to talk to their artists, freely and at
<br>
length. They need to be able to applaud. The copyright
<br>
model makes this hard, because the audience response is
<br>
mediated by the copyright-owner, which at the least
<br>
muffles the signal and possibly redirects it
<br>
altogether. When people buy a Spice Girls album, whose
<br>
are they 'applauding': the artists or EMD/Virgin's
<br>
promotion and marketing departments?
<br>
<p>These technical and cultural trends interact. Our
<br>
dissatisfaction with copyright causes us to champion
<br>
technologies that evade it (why are we not sad to see
<br>
copyright eroded?) and the technologies allow us to
<br>
experience and think about new relationships with
<br>
artists against which our dissatisfaction with
<br>
copyrights grows even worse. We end up thinking about
<br>
alternatives like voluntary payments.
<br>
<p>Voluntary payments are conceptually simple and cheap to
<br>
maintain, since all parties have the same goals: the
<br>
donor wants the money to go to the artist and the artist
<br>
wants to get it. They are infinitely flexible, and
<br>
therefore can be configured to be receptive to any sort
<br>
of user response. In theory when I listen to a
<br>
performance by the Boston Symphony I would have the
<br>
choice of donating to the composer's estate, to the
<br>
conductor, the soloist, the musician's union, or any
<br>
combination of these. If the Symphony was able to make
<br>
use of this information, more power to them. In the
<br>
context of music they would almost certainly pay
<br>
musicians more than they get from the copyright
<br>
industries now, because right now almost no musicians
<br>
get anything from their recording companies but some
<br>
free CDs.
<br>
<p>People have lots of reasons to give money to artists:
<br>
because they need it; because they deserve it; because
<br>
this is righteous shit that the world needs to hear;
<br>
because it is the right thing to do; because without
<br>
donations musical culture will atrophy. Motives much
<br>
like these prompt us to give $16 billion a year to
<br>
waiters and waitresses (more than the annual revenues of
<br>
the entire recording industry) and $300 billion a year
<br>
to charities. It would not seem hard to improve on the
<br>
present system in terms of sheer returns.
<br>
<p>Other benefits seem possible. To repeat, copyright
<br>
businesses typically have high fixed costs and low
<br>
marginal costs; in such sectors discriminatory pricing,
<br>
in which some pay more than others, is economically
<br>
rational, in that it should lead to wider distribution
<br>
of the product, which (presumably) should benefit the
<br>
culture as a whole (since more people will be able to
<br>
express and satisfy their preferences). Producers
<br>
themselves also benefit from the largest possible
<br>
distribution, of course.
<br>
<p>Despite this logic, discriminatory pricing is impossible
<br>
as a practical matter, because, as Amazon has recently
<br>
had occasion to learn, buyers hate it when it is imposed
<br>
on them by corporations.  Voluntary payments offer a way
<br>
around this problem; they promote what is in effect
<br>
discriminatory pricing (assuming donors get to choose
<br>
the size of their 'tip'), running all the way down to
<br>
zero, and in a form that no one is likely to object to.
<br>
People are seldom bothered when the diner at the next
<br>
table leaves a lower tip than they do. (To the contrary,
<br>
they are likely to feel better about themselves.)
<br>
<p>It is very difficult now to capitalize on the great
<br>
opportunities the internet offers to tighten the
<br>
connection between artists and their audience, since in
<br>
so many cases a corporation ends up in the middle of the
<br>
bed. For instance, the more a band knows about its fans
<br>
the smarter it can be about planning tours and designing
<br>
and distributing merchandise. As a consumer I don't
<br>
necessarily want Rupert Murdock to have that
<br>
information, but I am less likely to mind giving my zip
<br>
code or even email address to an artist that I am giving
<br>
actual money to.
<br>
<p>Another example of the same effect: There is some
<br>
apprehension that the copyright industries will use
<br>
encryption and their control of the legal system to
<br>
impose what will amount to a 'pay- per- listen' regime
<br>
on music consumers. At present PPL is viewed with
<br>
extreme alarm by many as the ultimate in corporate
<br>
control of the culture. Yet it true that it is good for
<br>
artists, and therefore us, to have the most accurate,
<br>
resolved, picture of the relation of their art to their
<br>
audience. Under a voluntary payment scheme, where
<br>
consumers could choose whether or not to enroll in such
<br>
a program and revenues went first to the artist, PPL
<br>
might be much more acceptable.
<br>
<p>Copyright businesses typically have high fixed and low
<br>
marginal costs. It is easy to see how voluntary payments
<br>
might deal with the latter. How about the fixed costs:
<br>
production and promotion? An artist with a history of
<br>
attracting significant voluntary payments might be able
<br>
to borrow against future proceeds, but other ideas are
<br>
possible. We can imagine a site on which a
<br>
writer/director/composer/musician describes a project of
<br>
personal interest on a website somewhere and names a sum
<br>
that will allow the project to be financed; fans make
<br>
commitments to the project of choice; when these
<br>
commitments pass the threshold sum all the
<br>
&quot;micropatrons&quot; are notified and their credit cards
<br>
charged accordingly. www.openculture.org is an
<br>
&quot;evaluation model&quot; that is already online. The theory of
<br>
such a system is discussed in detail at
<br>
<a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue4_6/kelsey">http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue4_6/kelsey</a>.
<br>
<p>One can sort the sectors of social economies -- or at
<br>
least their productive modes -- into command, market,
<br>
and gift. Workers in command mode (like soldiers) work
<br>
because they are told to; in market mode because they
<br>
are paid; in gift mode because they are doing what they
<br>
want to be doing. Examples within this culture might be
<br>
artists or scientists. In a command economy status
<br>
varies by rank; in a market, by income; in a gift, by
<br>
professional reputation (usually) or possibly the size
<br>
of the population consuming or enjoying the product.
<br>
<p>Command economies are predictable and stable but
<br>
unproductive, both because they are economically
<br>
irrational and learn slowly.  Gift cultures, on the
<br>
other extreme, are enormously productive, not because
<br>
they make efficient use of material resources, which
<br>
they do not, but because they tap the potential inherent
<br>
in human creativity and passion. They are, however,
<br>
chaotic; goods and services are likely to appear and
<br>
disappear without warning, which in many contexts makes
<br>
their higher productivity purely theoretical. Market
<br>
cultures fall somewhere in between, imposing more order
<br>
than a gift economy but permitting more unpredictability
<br>
than a command economy. Gift economies generate a huge
<br>
range of one-of-a-kind products and services, command
<br>
economies only a handful, with market economies, again,
<br>
somewhere in between.
<br>
<p>If we accept that traditional cultures, with their noble
<br>
and clerical hierarchies and confining traditions were a
<br>
species of command culture, the trend in our time (for
<br>
whatever reason) has clearly been from Command to
<br>
Market. The fate of socialism emphasizes the point. The
<br>
internet appears to be dragging the market culture --
<br>
kicking and screaming, in many cases -- through the next
<br>
transition, into a gift society. The first illustration
<br>
of the point was the rise of Open Source
<br>
programming. Voluntary payments may be the second.
<br>
<p>The internet's great powers of connectivity and
<br>
selection have allowed it to compensate for the chaotic
<br>
nature of the Gift economy with a huge range of
<br>
inputs. Whatever you want, given a hundred million
<br>
sites, or however many there are, someone is going to be
<br>
offering it in Gift economy mode, which means with
<br>
verve, dedication, humor, and passion, and very
<br>
cheaply. This is a difficult package for conventional
<br>
market-mode producers to compete with. If you have a
<br>
hundred sites offering a given good, all equally
<br>
accessible, it no longer matters if one or two disappear
<br>
because their maintainers grew bored. There are always
<br>
others willing to step in to replace them.
<br>
<p>Voluntary payments would seem to be the natural
<br>
transaction mechanism for a gift economy. They are
<br>
disorderly and chaotic, but they place relationships and
<br>
passion at the heart of the producer/consumer
<br>
interaction. Given any kind of chance, nothing can stand
<br>
against a dynamic with genes like those.
