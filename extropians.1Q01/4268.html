<p>I know that we all gloss over irrationalities in our own philosophies 
<br>
to some extent, since it's basic human nature.  In order to achieve 
<br>
any coherence of thought, human beings can't constantly question 
<br>
every notion they've ever had.
<br>
<p>That's why it's good to have reminders, like Extropians principle #7. 
<br>
We need to be ever vigilant against falling into the trap of 
<br>
accepting our own logical inconsistencies.
<br>
<p>I think that it's fair to say that some groups hold on to rationality 
<br>
more than others.  Look at the scientific community researching 
<br>
genetics.  They just had their apple carts completely upset with the 
<br>
discovery that we have far fewer genes than had been previously 
<br>
suspected.  What did they do, ignore the issue?  Attack those who 
<br>
dared contradict their preconceptions?  No, for the most part they 
<br>
just said, &quot;holy shit&quot;, and have started to wrap their minds around 
<br>
the new concept.  Here's an op ed from Stephen Jay Gould:
