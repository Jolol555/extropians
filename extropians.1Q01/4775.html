Egoism is always an annoyance, especially when seeking information from 
<br>
somebody talented or gifted.  That is one of the problems of  mailing lists 
<br>
also, is that the people involved get overloaded with competition for 
<br>
attention, as well as the ego-related notion that &quot;I shall not suffer fools 
<br>
gladly.&quot;  This leaves some of us reckoning that we all play the fool at some 
<br>
point, whether we are brilliant or average. 
<br>
So food for thought, if you want to advance your cause, whether Extropianism 
<br>
or the Singularity, or Transhumanism; niceness and patience counts.

<p>&lt;&lt; t seems I was wrong not to discuss the incident.  I have no particular
<br>
&nbsp;interest in pursuing a grudge with Marvin Minsky, though I'll confess that
<br>
&nbsp;I felt pretty disillusioned then and I still feel disillusioned now.  For
<br>
&nbsp;the record, I didn't do anything to attack Minsky or defend myself, I
<br>
&nbsp;didn't write anything at all about the incident, until I found out the
<br>
&nbsp;hard way that the ripples hadn't just died out - that they were, in fact,
<br>
&nbsp;affecting other people considering me as a possible speaker.  This post is
<br>
&nbsp;to make clear my view of what happened, and I'd like to ask all of you to
<br>
&nbsp;forward it on wherever these rumors are discussed. &gt;&gt;
