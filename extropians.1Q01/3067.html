<p>Practicality be praised.  Part of the reason I squick people with that
<br>
single astronaut riff is that I fail to provide enough background on
<br>
my assumptions.  Those interested in Mars colonies need to start
<br>
out by realizing two things  1.  how damned expensive it is, and
<br>
2.  where the money is coming from.
<br>
<p>I think it was you who pointed out that governments are unlikely
<br>
to come up with the money.  Did not Papa Bush ask NASA what
<br>
it would cost?  He was told 500 billion.  Hmmmm.  Turns out
<br>
governments are not at liberty to do the stunts that privately funded
<br>
organizations are free to do.

<br>
<p>These links are not great, but they are a starting point.  It points
<br>
out an order of magnitude on how much it takes to soft-land stuff
<br>
on Mars, or the moon for that matter.  For instance the Vikings were
<br>
launched by a Titan III with a Centaur upper stage.  The mass of the
<br>
lander was 576 kg.  Cost of the mission in current bucks, about
<br>
3 billion.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, all the propulsion/guidance tech needed to do a Mars
<br>
mission today is already developed.  However, if you take the
<br>
time to review the sizes of the past Mars landers, you will see
<br>
why we need to go to absurd lengths to reduce the weight of
<br>
the payload.  A typical stock buyer would perhaps drop 100
<br>
bucks for a share, eh?  Well, fine, that constitutes *one gram* of
<br>
food.  Dinner will run well over a thousand dollars per bite.  Shall
<br>
we not search far and wide for the minimal biter?  This minimal
<br>
approach is all about practicality, John.
<br>
<p>ct suggested removal of redundant organs.  Well, why not?  But
<br>
not intestines, those need to be fully functional and extracting
<br>
every calorie, especially considering those calories cost 30 bucks
<br>
apiece.  And that is an optimistic estimate.  Keep those in there.
<br>
<p>All of these problems will be solvable if someone would just
<br>
kindly provide us with a person 30 cm tall and weighing 5 kg,
<br>
with an appetite to match.  The rest of the miniaturization we
<br>
can do.  spike
