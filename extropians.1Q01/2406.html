<p>I'll grant you readily that Flight Simulator is an excellent, probably
<br>
even the best flight simulator software on market. It is one of a
<br>
rare instance where Redmond bought a company, and managed not to screw
<br>
up a decent product. Miracles happen.
<br>
<p>I honestly don't know of a single instance of a decent MS product having
<br>
been developed entirely in-house. Max, anyone, please tell me one, I 
<br>
honestly want to know. Such a case needs to be studied, since being an 
<br>
excellent diagnostic, the first step to therapy.
<br>
<p>My point is that there's something strange going on inside Microsoft.
<br>
They have money to hire the best of the best in the industry (their
<br>
job interviews is state of the art in Spanish Inquisition), and they 
<br>
did. But somehow, the company structure is scrambled, and, worse, 
<br>
scrambled in a way which actively resists fixing.
<br>
<p>For instance, yesterday www.microsoft.com was unreachable for
<br>
prolonged periods of time (see the register for details), and according
<br>
to preliminary reports it turned out Microsofts three DNS servers were 
<br>
all on the same subnet, which was unreachable.
<br>
<p>&lt;BOGGLE&gt;
<br>
<p>Now I'm not a system administrator, but this is one of the basic
<br>
cardinal sins of system administration. You Just Don't Do That,
<br>
even for a mom &amp; pop shop. Not to be talking about the Death Star
<br>
of software industry. This is like putting self-destruct buttons
<br>
right next to the light switches on a Navy destroyer. (Or letting
<br>
said destroyer be run by software which makes it unmaneuvrable
<br>
for hours by entering a zero in a screen mask, see RISKS).
<br>
<p>I wouldn't even be mentioning if this was an isolated incidence,
<br>
but you surely remember the break-in into the inner sanctum, where
<br>
the intruders had the opportunity to see and modify OS sources for
<br>
several weeks, after a guy clicked on an executable mail attachement,
<br>
containing a well-known remote administration package aka backdoor.
<br>
<p>There were others, of similiar magnitude. The deeper you dig, the more
<br>
astonishing stuff you unearth, also the little issue of business
<br>
practices which look like a judicious mix of a buccaneer and Catharina
<br>
de Medici. Even more bogglement ensues if one reads the BUGTRAQ list 
<br>
for prolonged periods of time. Worse that the bugs are many and should 
<br>
never found their way into production code, MS has very deep meta 
<br>
level/design problems, and as a collective entity is not even aware 
<br>
that it does have them.
<br>
<p>I think many books and dissertations will be written postmortem on the
<br>
issue, and that a similiar debacle never occurs in the industry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you are incapable of an objective view. The vast gulf in perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between some of the programmers and the actual users (who pay for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff) astounds me. I'm amazed that all this vitriol is reserved
</em><br>
<p>It seems that users are rather tolerant of flaky software, system 
<br>
crashes and loss of data, and attribute the results due to their own 
<br>
mistakes or that it cannot be done better, obviously, because Microsoft,
<br>
an industry leader and standard, is unable to do better.
<br>
<p>As to users, well there's something to be said for naivete, and not
<br>
being able to associate cause with effect, especially on the really
<br>
long run. My attitude by now is to let people who insist on using
<br>
broken software despite being repeatedly pointed out alternatives
<br>
to deal with their own problems. When I was looking for a job I
<br>
explicitly ignored all heavy MS shops. Right now my desire to deal
<br>
with things Microsoft is about the same as handling week-old roadkill.
<br>
Unprovoked, I usually think about MS as much as about said roadkill.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; exclusively for MS and Gates, while Ellison and that hypocritical McNealy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the self-described libertarian who runs to the politicians rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing) are left alone. What's that all about?
</em><br>
<p>Huh? We started this this flambe fete, since someone started expressing
<br>
glowing admiration for one William H. Gates, for what he has done to the
<br>
user community and the industry in particular. 
<br>
<p>He wasn't singing praise to Ellison, iirc. I'm not particularly impressed
<br>
with the Oracle line of database products (though being noticeably
<br>
better than Redmond's offering), particularly given recently maturing
<br>
OpenSource alternatives (check out <a href="http://mysql.com">http://mysql.com</a> , for instance). 
<br>
They're not there yet, but it doesn't take a genius to extrapolate 
<br>
that quite soon they will be.
<br>
<p>I will not praising Sun here, though at least their OS is decent. Their
<br>
hardware is unremarkable, especially given recent trend to COTS clustering,
<br>
and Java technology is not something I could weep tears of joy about.
<br>
<p>Summa summarum, these are the lesser villains. I would have reacted to
<br>
anyone praising them unreflexively in a somewhat toned down fashion,
<br>
but I would have reacted.
