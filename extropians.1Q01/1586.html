<p><em>    &gt;Actually, quantum theory sounds a whole lot kookier than Velikovsky-

</em><br>
<p>It doesn't matter how strange something sounds, only how well it fits the facts.
<br>
Velikovsky doesn't fit the fact of the conservation of energy, or momentum, it
<br>
doesn't fit with Newton's theory of gravity, or Einstein's, it doesn't explain how
<br>
a highly elliptical orbit of a comet can become the most nearly circular orbit of any
<br>
of the planets in the solar system, that of Venus. And oh yes I almost forgot, there is
<br>
that little discrepancy of a thousand trillion or so between the mass of a comet and
<br>
that of a planet.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;*&quot;I have already carefully read the first volume of the memoirs to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&quot;Worlds in Collision,&quot; and have supplied it with a few marginal notes
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;in pencil that can be easily erased...&quot; --Albert Einstein, letter to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;Immanuel Velikovsky, March 17, 1955
</em><br>
<p>It's possible Einstein actually did write to the jerk, I know at times when the mood hit him
<br>
he also corresponded with children who thought they made a great scientific discovery,
<br>
he tried to let them down gently without destroying there enthusiasm for science. Assuming
<br>
that he actually wrote to Velikovsky, and I have no evidence that he did, I have no doubt that
<br>
once you factor out Einstein's well known politeness the &quot;marginal notes&quot; were the equivalent
<br>
of &quot; You sir are a jackass.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I refuse to discount a theory based upon the opinion and characterizations of an
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;individual who has examined said theory for a total of 4.3 seconds
</em><br>
<p>Do as you please, just don't do it on the Extropian list, it's for serious discussions.
<br>
As for me. I'm bitter that Velikovsky has stolen 4.3 seconds of my life that I will never get back.
