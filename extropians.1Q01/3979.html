If PETA is so concerned about the welfare of animals why don't they put
<br>
their money where their mouth is and fund a program of  DNA/tissue research
<br>
to develop a healthy tank grown meat to replace existing animal sources. It
<br>
could be cheaper, easier on the environment, healthier and better than
<br>
killing animals.

<em>&gt;&gt; I took a trip to PETA's website (which is pretty and very nicely done) but

<em>&gt;&gt; couldn't find a single instance of an alternative use of the lives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; domesticated animals.  Should we let them go free?  I seem to remember a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; story about a group of eco-terrorists in France who released a whole bunch
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; away right into traffic where a bunch were killed.  Can you imagine what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would happen if we set pigs free to roam the forrests?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This isn't the real problem.  Even if people do decide to stop eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;animals, it won't happen overnight.  Herds will gradually decrease over a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;period of years as farmers breed less due to decreased demand.  We won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to decide what to do with millions of unwanted cows and hogs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The issue, rather, is that a bunch of &quot;potential&quot; animals, who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been born, raised, slaughtered and eaten, won't be born at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The total number of cow-minutes of life will be greatly reduced, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likewise for other food animals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Whether you see this as good or bad might depend on how you view the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quality of life of farm animals today.
