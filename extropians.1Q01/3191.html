The PDA might contain the citizen's life-saving medical device.  Any interference
<br>
with personal electronics that threatens the health of the citizen is not allowed.
<br>
<p>Almost every single phone has a simple password of at least one letter or number.
<br>
If you have reason to believe that you would care to use it, then you don't have to
<br>
give it to anybody without a subpoena.
