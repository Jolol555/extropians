I've snipped the stuff where we basically agreed; I hope that isn't a sign
<br>
of a combative personality on my part (who am I kidding?).

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A really very interesting thing to note about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural selection is that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; works better than you would imagine. I learned this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; after working on some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; material from a book called &quot;genetic programming&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (can't remember the author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or anything else, it was borrowed from the library).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It turns out that, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; software mimicking the process of natural selection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you can evolve highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ordered solutions or systems (even software) from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surprisingly small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number of generations. What you can do in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; afternoon on a single-processor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pentium is quite astounding, and un-intuitive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps the world could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; created in 7 days after all; it'd probably require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; P4 though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Yeah; some interesting stuff going on right now. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course, WE intelligently PROGRAMMED the computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do this within parameters established by us.
</em><br>
<p>Only partially are the parameters established by us. Mostly we are mimicking
<br>
a &quot;natural&quot; process, where by &quot;natural&quot; I mean it came about and continues
<br>
without/despite us (probly shudda useda diffrent word).
<br>
<p>The stuff we change is usually either because we are working on something
<br>
not naturally occuring (xor table, for example), or because the &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
process is hideously complicated; too damned hard.
<br>
<p>I'll just throw in an unrelated argument against design (as opposed to
<br>
natural selection) - what you see around you is all kludges. The much
<br>
vaunted eye, far from being the miracle of creation, is quite flawed and
<br>
dodgy. DNA itself seems to be a fairly klunky thing in whole, likewise
<br>
neurons and a bazillion other biological mechanisms. There's no wheel, no
<br>
gears/levers, all kinds of stuff missing from the &quot;natural&quot; world. If it's
<br>
hand designed, it's done pretty poorly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What do you mean by &quot;The intelligence may BE the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system&quot;? How?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **How? I don't know how. It could all be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective experience of a single consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something like Shintoism (later repackaged as The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Force).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK, that's all very metaphysical, but what does it mean? We could all be a
<br>
weird video game in a real universe, just some really overblown detail in a
<br>
distant corner, whilst the green beep-beep protaganist fights black droids
<br>
on the other side of space.
<br>
<p>But that doesn't matter one jot, unless it affects us. Either it affects us,
<br>
which means the laws of physics, elusive as they can be, are violated now
<br>
and again, or it doesn't, in which case they are not.
<br>
<p>If it doesn't affect us at all, then by Occam's razor we cannot consider it,
<br>
because it is of no useful purpose. The intangible is pure conjecture, by
<br>
definition.
<br>
<p>If it does affect us, we must at some point be able to detect it. Yet again,
<br>
whilst we can find no reasonable purpose to presuppose a &quot;supernatural&quot;
<br>
meddler, we must presume there is not one. If we can detect it, then we have
<br>
another ball game. This is not currently the case.
<br>
<p>I know it sounds terribly banal of me to be so utilitarian. But consider; to
<br>
what purpose do we assume an interfering external entity, when we have no
<br>
evidence? What can we do if we allow this? Nothing. If we cannot predict
<br>
it's actions, we cannot predict the universe. People can make wild claims of
<br>
regarding its actions, and we cannot refute them. Kind of dumb, if there is
<br>
no evidence.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, we seem to be getting by fairly well by assuming no
<br>
external force. We can predict things, we continue to learn more; things
<br>
which are pretty detailed, as Damien has pointed out.
<br>
<p>Another point of view; what makes an external entity? If it acts as part of
<br>
the universe (works with it), then it is part of the universe; an ET at best
<br>
(after all, this idea of conscious directed entity, that's a being). If it
<br>
changes things in the universe, it is operating within &quot;natural&quot; laws
<br>
(perhaps ones that we don't know about). So there's no such thing as an
<br>
external entity; it must be internal. The only external entity is one which
<br>
never affects the universe; pointless to speculate on.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the physical laws of the universe somehow embody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is some extra thing which guides their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (assumedly capricious)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **I believe (note use of word &quot;believe&quot;) that at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very least, something consciously determined the rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by which the game would be played, and then set it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into motion. Whether that something is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around..(?) Why not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough. That question about whether or not something consciously kicked
<br>
the whole thing off does not have a clear answer, or maybe any credible
<br>
answer at this point. It might even be the wrong question. So pick your
<br>
favorite.
<br>
<p>However, whether this thing, this conscious directed entity, is still
<br>
kicking around, is subject to the points I made above. Either it affects the
<br>
universe, or it doesn't. We must assume it, or anything fitting it's
<br>
description, does not.
<br>
<p>I should say something about the nature of scientific enquiry, which is
<br>
this; science does not find the &quot;truth&quot;. The truth is a statement about
<br>
absolute reality, which we cannot directly experience. What science does,
<br>
instead, is helps us to build an increasingly complex and increasingly
<br>
complete *model* of reality, of truth. It's a behaviorist approach.
<br>
<p>For instance, we know nothing &quot;true&quot; about the subatomic world, to take a
<br>
tiny example (apologies). We do know, however, a lot about how it behaves,
<br>
through models we have constructed of that world, honed by measuring,
<br>
relatively indirectly, it's behaviour. So, we can talk about atoms, quarks,
<br>
spin, resonance, and quantum effects. But none of these things is &quot;true&quot;;
<br>
they just well describe a piece of reality which we cannot directly
<br>
experience; by well describe, I mean that they have, as corollaries,
<br>
falsifiable predictions, which tend not to be falsified.
<br>
<p>It is in this light of modelling truth, that Occam's Razor is used as the
<br>
guiding principle. This is necessary because anything can be modelled in
<br>
multiple ways, all of those ways being correct. The &quot;model&quot; example is the
<br>
circular orbits of the heavenly bodies, due to Aristotle, with all the
<br>
epicycle kludging used to make the models fit reality (at least closely
<br>
enough) vs Copernicus' revelation of eliptical orbits. Both of these are
<br>
valid models; both can be used; however, eliptical orbits seem to work more
<br>
&quot;cleanly&quot;, ie: they don't require such complexity, and eliptical orbits mesh
<br>
with other theories, most notably gravitation. Circular orbits and Epicycles
<br>
would require some pretty hard transformation of newton's laws to integrate
<br>
usefully. Which is possibly doable, but would be ridiculously complex;
<br>
Occam's Razor says no.
<br>
<p>The conscious directing entity is also a victim of William of Occam's
<br>
pronouncement. We have been able to show that the laws of physics model
<br>
reality to a useful degree; coming back to the case in point, the utility of
<br>
the theory of natural selection in many areas, amongst them biological
<br>
evolution, is not in doubt. So we either assume those laws (plus stuff we
<br>
don't know yet) on their own, or we assume them + CDE. There is no way as
<br>
yet to say which way is &quot;true&quot;, but CDE has not shown it's utility. So it's
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>But without evidence, it's a matter of aesthetics; Occam's Razor is
<br>
fundamentally an aesthetic principle, an heuristic. So I guess you can
<br>
choose any way you will. I'm an atheist, personally, and I don't believe in
<br>
a CDE who interferes with things; but I recognise it as an aesthetic choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  That's the same as assuming God, as far as I can see.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Hmm. You wanna call that God? Okay. God is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details. When people say God, I think of this big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muscular bearded guy pointing fingers and hurling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thunderbolts. That I don't buy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Only a drooling idiot would buy that. Actually, now that I think about it,
<br>
I'd buy a God that threw thunderbolts; as long as he is house trained (I'm
<br>
renting, got white carpets).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; **Discussion broadened, or so I thought. &quot;Angelic?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hardly. (Hey that's religion, ain't it?) There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no proof we evolved from primordial pond scum, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in turn evolved from nothing. doesn't that sound a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; LITTLE unlikely..?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Well, we came from somewhere. A fairly mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view is that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massively unlikely, in fact; however, there's a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe out there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a long, long time; on that scale, it becomes more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probable that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhen, this kind of improbable event could occur.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **AACCKKK!!!
</em><br>
<p>That's not up to par. I assume you mean &quot;that doesn't suit me
<br>
aesthetically&quot;. You have to explain why (your specific objection), and what
<br>
your alternative is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The really big jump, I think, is from non-replacing
</em><br>
(I meant to say &quot;replicating&quot;, not &quot;replacing&quot;)
<br>
<em>&gt; chemical soup to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicators.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **That first step's a dandy, all right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd like to hear some pontificating on this from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledgable, if any of you are reading this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Ditto.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; After the replicators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, it all becomes a lot more stolid, marching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to generation. Now, from pond scum to us, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty unlikely, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any state some billions (?) of years after the initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iterative system. From pond scum to something which in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no way resembles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; origins, that is incredibly probable. From pond scum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pond scum,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unimaginable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;On the other hand, the probability does not come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play. By the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle, we are going to be us, intelligent life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because what else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be? If we had never existed, that might say something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us existing. Our existence, however, does not say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are possible. It is not possible to estimate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our origin does not have to be probable. Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Double AAACCKKK!!!
</em><br>
<p>Again, explain yourself. That's a cogent argument, which you have not
<br>
addressed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't really explain anything; there is a whiff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of trolldom in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **No; you know what it is, really? I've been spending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much time around idiots, and then I tuned in to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this place. Perhaps I'm overcompensating.
</em><br>
<p>It's a tough crowd, I'll give you that. This is a pet topic too; the burden
<br>
of argument lies on you, however unfair that might seem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What do you mean?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  More than handwaving about something greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves; let us know how you really think we came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about. What's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **I don't know. And on this issue of original origin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (can there even be such a thing?) I'm not sure WHAT I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean in its entirety--but I DO mean, as a part of it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that This Place (Life, The Universe, and Everything)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not happenstance. I will never believe that. Can I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove it? Of course not--not can anyone prove it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. But to reiterate:
<br>
- There is no reason to assume God (sorry, CDE) or not. In the absence of a
<br>
reason, He is Razored away.
<br>
- Even if there is a CDE to organise time zero, it says nothing about any
<br>
time after that. The machine seems to run well enough on it's own.
<br>
- CDE can be motivational for some scientists and thinkers, but is only a
<br>
hindrance in actual predictive hypotheses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; **How can we even go about it properly when our minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot even grasp the concepts involved? For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example--when and what was the beginning? There had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be one--yet a beginning is, quite clearly, a logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossibility. There had to be something before that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on... Same with the extent of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I believe that this is a deceptive simplification.
<br>
<p>As humans, we experience a few things which are questionable when applied to
<br>
the universe. Cause&amp;effect, linear time, a pitiful handful of dimensions, to
<br>
name a few. Most importantly, we expect reasons for things. There isn't a
<br>
lot of evidence that this stuff applies universally.
<br>
<p>The idea of the universe having a beginning implies a strong linearity, and
<br>
ignores an important point; what came before the beginning? Who created the
<br>
creator? The more you think about it, the more you see that a universe which
<br>
must probably go on forever, must also probably have been forever. So then,
<br>
where is the necessity for a creator in the first place? Being as there is
<br>
no first place?
<br>
<p>Then this is woolly headed too. After all, it seems that time is a far more
<br>
complex beasty than this simple train-track approach. For a start, it
<br>
procedes relatively. Time passes differently in different places. I believe
<br>
(I could be wrong about this, out of my depth), that the &quot;big bang&quot; starts
<br>
at a point where there is no time. Time comes from it, in some very odd
<br>
sense. I can't talk anymore about this; I don't know anything about it. But
<br>
it does seem that, before you can ask &quot;what came first&quot;, you must prove the
<br>
validity of the concept &quot;first&quot; as valid in this context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; **We must become more than we are to find out. That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what this is about, yes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Maybe. More than we are will be fun... that's my motivation; basically quite
<br>
ego-driven. Quite possibly we could find out everything without changing at
<br>
all, eventually. But we keep finding out very cool things on the way; things
<br>
that cry out to be applied. I think I'm a transhumanist because I'm
<br>
programmed to be, because a long time ago it turned out to be useful to
<br>
think and make tools, so I was programmed (by natural selection) to get a
<br>
kick out of these things.
