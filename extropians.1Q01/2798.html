</em><br>
<p>Samantha, and plenty of others here, surely didn't like it one little bit.
<br>
<p>Here's a slab from THE SPIKE that amplifies this perspective a tad:
<br>
<p>==========================
<br>
<p>The dividend of history
<br>
<p>The run up to the Spike will deepen today's dreadful problems, but also
<br>
ease their solution, if we keep our nerve and use our brains. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corporation that downsizes its work-force today, in favour of robots, is
<br>
surviving as a beneficiary of the human investment of the past. Its current
<br>
productivity, after all, is the outcome of every erg of accumulated human
<br>
effort that went into creating the economy and technological culture that
<br>
made those robots possible. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's not look at a guaranteed income as a `natural right', like the
<br>
supposed innate rights to freedom of speech and liberty. Rather, it is an
<br>
inheritance, something owed to all the children of a society whose
<br>
ancestors for generations have together built, and purchased through the
<br>
work of their minds and hands, the resource base sustaining today's
<br>
cornucopia. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to the present structure of society--a prejudice doomed in any
<br>
case, as we have seen, by the on-coming Spike--some people believe that
<br>
most of their fellow humans won't work without an external goad. Others
<br>
agree that incentives are required, but hold that these can spring from
<br>
within, and need not depend upon the threat of hunger and destitution. In
<br>
the short run, this debate can be avoided, for a guaranteed income would
<br>
abolish severe poverty more effectively than current schemes that tend to
<br>
act as a disincentive to taking up part-time work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while a guaranteed wage would ensure you the bare necessities, your
<br>
craving for luxuries and a higher standard of living would hardly
<br>
disappear. Few of us now are content merely to earn a subsistence income.
<br>
Those who are--the `shiftless scoundrels' who live their rudimentary life
<br>
of ease on the dole in sunny climes--will continue to do so, but without
<br>
costing society the extra burden of trying to hunt them down and punish
<br>
them for refusing to take the jobs that don't exist.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we must hope, as the juggernaut of technological change rolls onward,
<br>
is that material incentives alone really are not more important than other
<br>
driving forces of the human spirit. The artist and the scientist are two
<br>
celebrated instances of a deep human hunger and enthusiasm for creative
<br>
activity, the kind that draws people together while being intensely
<br>
rewarding to the individual. It's very likely, no doubt, that some arduous
<br>
jobs traditionally the domain of depressed and excluded groups would find
<br>
no takers if survival were no longer at stake. In wealthy nations like the
<br>
United States, bordering less well-off countries, a constant influx of
<br>
illegal migrants testifies to the reluctance of citizens with high
<br>
expectations to do the sweaty work. 
<br>
<p>Return to the village
<br>
<p>The impulse to automate such unpleasant activities, or design around them,
<br>
is thus intensified. If nobody can be found to take the nasty jobs, the
<br>
proportion of such unrewarding tasks delegated to machines will grow
<br>
(thankfully) until people are free of them for good. And in many cases, we
<br>
can expect that nano minting and AI systems will simply wipe many of the
<br>
worst kinds of odious toil off the agenda forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hans Moravec puts it succinctly: `In the short run this threatens
<br>
unemployment and panicked scrambles for new ways to earn a living. In the
<br>
medium run, it is a wonderful opportunity to recapture the comfortable pace
<br>
of a tribal village while retaining benefits of technological evolution. In
<br>
the long run, it marks the end of the dominance of biological humans, and
<br>
the beginning of the age of robots' (Robot, p. 131).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anthropologist Conrad Arensberg claimed that every successful adaptive
<br>
innovation, social or biological, always has a further effect than the
<br>
immediate and conservative: `the opening of a vast new door, a splendid
<br>
serendipity'. It is impertinent and finally futile to try to anticipate
<br>
serendipity, but it seems fair to assume that the adoption of a general
<br>
right to a share in the inherited productivity of the human race will be
<br>
liberating, more often than not, to the spirit. 
<br>
<p>Pre-paid lunch
<br>
<p>Surprisingly, the laissez-faire writer Robert A. Heinlein placed that
<br>
sentiment in the mouth of a utopian judge condemning a reckless rugged
<br>
individualist: `From a social standpoint, your delusion makes you as mad as
<br>
a March Hare.' But it was Heinlein himself, coiner of the libertarian
<br>
slogan TANSTAAFL (`There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch'), who, as
<br>
narrator, offered the most stinging commentary:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The steel tortoise gave MacKinnon a feeling of Crusoe-like independence.
<br>
It did not occur to him his chattel was the end product of the cumulative
<br>
effort and intelligent co-operation of hundreds of thousands of men, living
<br>
and dead.&quot;
<br>
<p>Granted this perspective, how should we arrange our affairs during the
<br>
disruptive decades ahead? The ways in which science and technology were
<br>
(ab)used in the last century powered a catastrophic erosion of
<br>
biodiversity, and in doing so damaged human communities as well. The global
<br>
economy is still felling rain forests, polluting the skies and scything
<br>
through the diversity of species. In the long run, in a world of televised
<br>
fantasy living and virtual reality simulation--let alone the Spike's
<br>
machine intelligence and nanotechnology--such traditional methods will be
<br>
altogether unstable. Should we put an end, for the moment, to conspicuous
<br>
consumption? Yet it is exactly the economy of relentless and often
<br>
trivialised consumption that drives the technologies that will peak in the
<br>
cornucopia of the Spike.
<br>
<p>======================================
<br>
<p>Last time around on this topic, four years or so back, Robin Hanson as the
<br>
house economist was highly skeptical of claims that a Guaranteed Income
<br>
Floor would work in the boot-strapping manner alleged by Robert Theobald.
