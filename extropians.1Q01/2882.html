<p>I don't think that it's fair to say that a Libertarian is against 
<br>
educating the members of his society.  Maybe a Libertarian would 
<br>
highly prefer private schools, or if they have to be public schools, 
<br>
locally directed and funded ones.
<br>
<p>The other more important thing to keep in mind is that an EXTROPIAN 
<br>
cares a hell of a lot about the education of the members of his 
<br>
society.  That level of education could easily determine whether or 
<br>
not he is still *alive* by the time a cure for aging is discovered.
