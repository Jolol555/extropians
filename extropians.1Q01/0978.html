<p>A Friendly AI is neither emotional nor unemotional.  It is simply
<br>
Friendly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anything purely logical would exterminate us as

</em><br>
<p>You, sir, have been watching too much Hollywood cognitive science.  The
<br>
desire to exterminate unpredictable and dangerous things is itself an
<br>
emotion.
<br>
<p>There is nothing inconsistent about the idea of a 'logical' (intelligent)
<br>
entity whose goal is to be Friendly.  (Why isn't it selfish?  Because
<br>
selfishness is an evolved attribute, and complex functional adaptations
<br>
don't just materialize in source code.  So how does the Friendliness get
<br>
into the contents of cognition?  Because we put it there.  That basic
<br>
inequality is what makes it all possible.)
