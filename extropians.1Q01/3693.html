<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can think of only four references to cryonics in film/TV:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1)  Clarke's 2001
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2)  6 Million Dollar Woman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3)  Woody Allen's Sleeper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;4)  Austin Powers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Any others that come to mind?  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Futurama.
<br>
Lots more, go to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/search">http://us.imdb.com/search</a>, scroll down to the &quot;Word Search&quot; 
<br>
option, select &quot;Keyword&quot; from the dropdown menu, and type in &quot;Cryonics&quot;. 
<br>
Also try &quot;Cryogenics&quot;, as thats what people with a faint familiarity with 
<br>
cryonics think its called.
<br>
<p>Personally I would prefer that very few people sign up for it or take it 
<br>
seriously for many reasons. One is that, as it becomes more widely known, 
<br>
there will be wider opposition to it. The idea that we all have a certain 
<br>
alloted time here, and that to want to live forever is unnatural, horrific, 
<br>
and  worst of all &quot;selfish&quot;, is going to be deeply rooted in most people's 
<br>
minds. I hope I'm the first person revived because unless there is a serious 
<br>
change in most people's moral attitude about life (fingers crossed), 
<br>
cryonics will be banned and agencies shut down soon after the first success. 
<br>
The reason this isn't happening right now is because it's not taken 
<br>
seriously. If someone with enough power started taking it more seriously 
<br>
then the public, then the agencies would be shut down under the pretense 
<br>
that they're defrauding their members. The fact that the members are willing 
<br>
participants and will vocally defend their right to be &quot;defrauded&quot; has never 
<br>
seemed to make a difference in the legislation of other victimless crimes. I 
<br>
tell people that I've signed up despite the fact that chances of my revival 
<br>
are slim, because slim is better then nothing. And when I say the chances of 
<br>
revival are slim, the scientific feasibility is the smallest part of the 
<br>
barrier preventing it. They should do the first revivals in secret and do 
<br>
them all at once.
<br>
When/if it is banned or fought against, a possible legal defense would be 
<br>
that a ban would violate freedom of (from) religion. My partaking, and that 
<br>
of others I assume, is very much tied to not having any religious beliefs 
<br>
about an afterlife. To allow other practices which rely on the belief in a 
<br>
supernatural afterlife, but disallow those that depend on belief in a 
<br>
potential natural &quot;afterlife&quot;, is religious discriminiation. Similarly to 
<br>
the way that atheists and agnostics are allowed to be conscientious 
<br>
objectors.
<br>
The downside of low signups is that is results in less money coming in to 
<br>
cryonics agencies, and also that there will be less research into revival 
<br>
scenerios.
