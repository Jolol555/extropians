<em>&gt;I apologize for graphically describing how these folks get and give 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each other jollies,
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for that.  I know how these kinds of conversations escalate 
<br>
and draw people in.  I've been drawn in myself many times.  I think a 
<br>
friendly reminder helps tone things down.  I don't think anybody is 
<br>
deliberately trying to disrupt the list.  We rarely have that 
<br>
problem.  As such, we really don't have serious opponents in this 
<br>
group.  We merely have some friendly disagreement over complicated 
<br>
issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;but you must agree that a flood of group backpatting comparisons of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gun models belongs on exi-freedom, not here.  The only reason that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are posting such stuff here instead of exi-freedom, where they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easily could be doing the same thing, is to exhibitionistically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expose the entire extropy list to it whether they want to be or not, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps hoping to (1) harass those who do not wish to be subjected 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to it (such as myself) and (2) troll for firearms voyeurs for their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exi list; I consider such behavior to be impositional, puerile and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfortunate.
</em><br>
<p>You may be right.  I don't think we have actually banned the subject, 
<br>
but I'm not sure if it belongs here either.
<br>
<p>I don't think guns are anti-extropian, but I'm not sure they are 
<br>
extropian either.  The may be unrelated technology.  Sure, extropians 
<br>
are pro-technology, pro-freedom, and pro-self-reliance, and the 
<br>
related tools are important.  But how detailed do we want to get into 
<br>
tools?  Gun advise would help extropians secure their personal safety 
<br>
and freedom.  Likewise, Windows debugging tips would help extropians 
<br>
daily use of technology.  Helping people smuggle in illegal 
<br>
life-extension drugs might help achieve our longevity goals. 
<br>
Debugging bottlenecks in the Internet would help our on-line 
<br>
communications flow smoothly.  Such tools are important, and are 
<br>
relevant for extropian goals, but are they really general interest 
<br>
enough to broadcast to every extropian on this list?
<br>
<p>I don't think so.  I think this list should be kept general interest. 
<br>
Very specialized topics should be diverted to smaller groups of 
<br>
experts (or other interested people) to hold more detailed 
<br>
discussions.  It is not that such topics are banned or wrong.  They 
<br>
merely are too specific for general consumption.  The glow-monkey 
<br>
discussion belongs here, because I think everyone is interested.  If 
<br>
we started debugging the exact DNA sequence of the monkey and started 
<br>
looking for more enhancements, that would be too specialized.  Most 
<br>
people would not participate in sequencing specific genetic 
<br>
base-pairs.  It would be so specialized, so extremely on-topic to a 
<br>
specific point, that most people would be unable to follow the 
<br>
conversation.  Likewise, general gun announcements or news could be 
<br>
posted here, but specific recommendations about where to shoot, where 
<br>
to get ammo, and comparing brands of ammo are too specialized.  Most 
<br>
people don't purchase new guns regularly enough to utilize such 
<br>
suggestions.  The number of people currently looking to purchase a 
<br>
new gun at any given time is a small fraction of the total list. 
<br>
More people will delete such a post unread than would read it.  Such 
<br>
a discussion is not wrong, but are merely off-topic for most readers. 
<br>
It becomes a specialized discussion for experts or for a smaller 
<br>
subset of the whole list.
<br>
<p>These are my opinions only.  No official decision has been made on 
<br>
this topic.  Even the oft-referenced &quot;gun ban&quot; was just temporary, 
<br>
and was just an emergency response to traffic overload on this list. 
<br>
It was not a permanent decision, and it was directed toward volume 
<br>
not topic.  I don't think anybody has actively tried to invent rules 
<br>
for which subjects are on-topic for extropians and which are not.
