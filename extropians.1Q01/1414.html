Keith Henson asked me to post this to the extropians list regarding his
<br>
ongoing legal battle with the Scientologists. Any support anyone can
<br>
provide him in his quest I think would be greatly appreciated. He's had
<br>
a rough time of things, and seems like the Hubbardites are trying to
<br>
bury him in paperwork. Any appeals from Californians to their Attorney
<br>
General on this case I think would be greately appreciated. Read on:
<br>
Cross-post as desired...

<br>
<p>Just because I am not posting much does not mean that all is quiet. More 
<br>
likely it means I am too busy to post very often.

<br>
The latest news is from my daughter.  My wife and I paid a lawyer in LA 
<br>
to seek a protective order to limit her deposition.  Judge March limited 
<br>
it to one hour and sanctioned the scientologists $1000 &quot;sue sponte.&quot; She 
<br>
also made comments to the effect of having never seen a bankruptcy of
<br>
even 
<br>
a major international company which had a 34 page docket sheet or this
<br>
many 
<br>
hours of deposition.  Of course, Helena Kobrin appealed the limit and
<br>
the 
<br>
sanctions.  The lawyer we were using has decided she no longer wants to 
<br>
be involved, so the papers Helena filed got shipped to us--nearly a half 
<br>
inch thick brief to the district court and a 1.5 inch thick stack of
<br>
pages 
<br>
pulled out of the court documents and deposition transcripts.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If anyone knows a lawyer in the LA area who would like to take on a
<br>
scientology 
<br>
case, my daughter could really use pro bono or reduced fees
<br>
representation. 
<br>
&nbsp;So far we have spent as much as half a year of college for her legal
<br>
representation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Speaking about abuse of process, I filed a complaint with the New York
<br>
Bar 
<br>
about Rosen.  I may post it here eventually, but for now, if you are
<br>
known 
<br>
to me just ask for a copy by email.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My trial in Hemet on &quot;misdemeanor terrorism&quot; starts a week from next
<br>
Monday,
<br>
&nbsp;assuming it is not overtaken by other events.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Which reminds me--from <a href="http://caag.state.ca.us/piu/da.htm">http://caag.state.ca.us/piu/da.htm</a>,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Complaints against District Attorneys are, in certain specified
<br>
situations,
<br>
&nbsp;handled directly by the Office of the Attorney General. However, the
<br>
Attorney 
<br>
General's intervention is appropriate only where there is a demonstrated 
<br>
conflict of interest which would disqualify the district attorney from a 
<br>
particular case.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
**********
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Also, if there is an obvious abuse of the district attorney's legal
<br>
discretion 
<br>
in the decision whether to file a criminal charge, the Attorney General 
<br>
may intervene.&quot;
<br>
******************************
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There is the statement of Deputy Tony Greer,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In reviewing all of the Internet postings I did not see any direct   
<br>
threat of violence towards the church or any personnel of the   church.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Combined with my First Amendment protected activity of picketing gold
<br>
base 
<br>
(and being arrested while picketing) makes the actions of the Hemet DAs 
<br>
look a lot like an &quot;obvious abuse of the district attorney's legal
<br>
discretion&quot; 
<br>
and an attempt to violate my right to peacefully protest the vicious
<br>
abuses 
<br>
of scientology.  (Including two deaths at gold last year.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't know if is any truth to vague rumors about Judge Rodney L.
<br>
Walker 
<br>
talking to the the AG's office, but there does seem to be darn good
<br>
cause 
<br>
if he has asked them to check out this case.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Of course, it would not hurt a bit for others to contact the California 
<br>
AG, especially Californians who can go through their elected
<br>
representaive 
<br>
and have them suggest to the AG that he take a look at the Deputy DAs in 
<br>
Hemet and this case.  But even if you are not from California, email
<br>
here 
<br>
will have an effect.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You can email right out of the form here <a href="http://caag.state.ca.us/piu/">http://caag.state.ca.us/piu/</a> 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Thanks to any who do.  I would appreciate your making a copy and posting 
<br>
it on alt.religion.scientology
<br>
and/or sending me a copy at <a href="mailto:hkhenson@pacbell.net?Subject=Re:%20Update%20on%20Keith%20Henson's%20Scientology%20trial...&In-Reply-To=&lt;3A64A241.583A77B5@datamann.com&gt;">hkhenson@pacbell.net</a>

<br>
PS, A really good video about the corruption of the Clearwater, FL
<br>
police 
<br>
is rapidly making the rounds in Hemet, where my trial will be held. 
<br>
Perhaps 
<br>
it can be put on the web, but anyone in the Bay area can ask to see it
<br>
in 
<br>
Palo Alto.
