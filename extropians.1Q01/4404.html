Although I have one or two minor reservations, for a public speech this is 
<br>
damned fine. Practically John Galt-like.
<br>
<p>Mr. Heston, you ARE the Omega Man!

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For 50 years, the Harvard Law School Forum has been sponsoring speeches by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  luminaries ranging from Fidel Castro to Gerald Ford to Dr. Ruth.  Sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the speeches have generated a bit of media coverage, sometimes not.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  given last month by Charlton Heston has taken on a life of its own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Heston,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the actor and conservative activist, delivered a stem-winder to about 200
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  listeners about &quot;a cultural war that's about to hijack your birthright to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  think and say what resides in your heart.&quot;  &quot;He knew he was coming to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  liberal environment, and clearly a group of his listeners was conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and another was more liberal,&quot; said David Christopherson, president of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  forum.  &quot;About half respectfully challenged him during the questions.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  generated a lot of debate around the campus.  But what's happened caught us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  off-guard.&quot;  What happened was Rush Limbaugh's radio talk show.  On March
</em><br>
<em>&gt;15,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Limbaugh read the entire speech on the air, only to find himself bombarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with thousands of requests for a copy of it.  The same thing happened at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Harvard Law.  &quot;We couldn't keep up with all the requests,&quot; said Mike Chmura
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  at Harvard.  &quot;It really didn't have legs and might have been forgotten if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Mr.Limbaugh hadn't decided to deliver it.&quot;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Winning the Cultural War' Charlton Heston's Speech to the Harvard Law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;School
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Forum February 16, 1999
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I remember my son when he was five, explaining to his kindergarten class
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  his father did for a living.  &quot;My Daddy,&quot; he said, &quot;pretends to be people.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  And there have been quite a few of them: Prophets from the Old and New
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Testaments, a couple of Christian saints, generals of various nationalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and different centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo.  If you want the ceiling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  re-painted I'll do my best.  There always seem to be a lot of different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fellows up here.  I'm never sure which one of them gets to talk.  Right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I guess I'm the guy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my Creator gave me the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gift
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men, then I want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  use that same gift now to re-connect you with your own sense of liberty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  your own freedom of thought ... your own compass for what is right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, &quot;We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.  &quot;  Those words are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  true again.  I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cultural war that's about to hijack your birthright to think and say what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  resides in your heart.  I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  liberty inside you ... the stuff that made this country rise from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wilderness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  into the miracle that it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Let me back up.  About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Association, which protects the right to keep and bear arms.  I ran for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I serve as a moving target for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  media who've called me everything from &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;duped&quot; to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;brain-injured, senile, crazy old man.&quot;  I know ... I'm pretty old... but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sure am not senile.  As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  issue.  No, it's much, much bigger than that.  I've come to understand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cultural war is raging across our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated.  For example, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;marched
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 - long before Hollywood found it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fashionable.  But when I told an audience last year that white pride is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  racist.  I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.  I served in World War II
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  against the Axis powers.  But during a speech, when I drew an analogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  singling out innocent Jews and singling out innocent gun owners, I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  an anti-Semite.  Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  against my country.  But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.  From Time magazine to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  friends and colleagues, they're essentially saying, &quot;Chuck, how dare you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  speak your mind.  You are using language not authorized for public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  consumption!&quot;  But I am not afraid.  If Americans believed in political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  correctness, we'd still be King George's boys - subjects bound to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;British
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  crown.  In his book, &quot;The End of Sanity,&quot; Martin Gross writes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  almost every area of human endeavor.  There seem to be new customs, new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rules, and newanti-intellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  direction. Underneath, the  nation is roiling.  Americans know something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  without a name is undermining  the nation, turning the mind mushy when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  comes to separating truth from  falsehood and right from wrong.  And they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  don't like it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot; Let me read a few examples.  At Antioch college in Ohio,  young men
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each  step of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   process from kissing to petting to final copulation ... all  clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  spelled  out in a printed college directive.  In New Jersey,  despite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  death of  several patients nationwide who had been infected by  dentists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  had  concealed their AIDS --- the state commissioner announced  that health
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  providers who are HIV-positive need not.....  need not .....  tell  their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  patients that they are infected.  At William and Mary, students tried  to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  change the name of the school team &quot;The Tribe&quot; because it was supposedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  insulting to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  truly like the name.  In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  protecting the rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  surgery.  In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in Spanish solely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  because their last names sound Hispanic.  At the University of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pennsylvania,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in a state where thousands died at Gettysburg opposing  slavery, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  president of that college officially set up segregated  dormitory space for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  black students.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds  now.  Dr. King said &quot;Negroes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jimmy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Baldwin and most of us on the March said  &quot;black.&quot;  But it's a no-no  now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ...  particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;Native-American.&quot;  I'm a Native American, for God's sake.  I also  happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux.  On my wife's side,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  my  grandson is a thirteenth generation native American... with a  capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  letter on &quot;American.&quot;  Finally, just last month ... David Howard,  head of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the Washington D.C. Office of Public Advocate, used the word &quot;niggardly&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  while talking to colleagues about budgetary matters.  Of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;niggardly&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  means stingy or scanty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But within days Howard was forced to  publicly apologize and resign.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  columnist Tony Snow wrote: &quot;David Howard  got fired because  some people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  public employ were morons who, (a) didn't  know the  meaning of niggardly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to  discover the meaning, and, (c)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  actually demanded that he apologize for  their ignorance.&quot;  What does all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  this mean?  It means that telling us  what to think has evolved into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  us what to say , so telling us what  to  do can't be far behind.  Before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  claim to be a champion of free thought,  tell me: Why did political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  correctness originate on America's  campuses?  And why do you continue to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  tolerate it?  Why do you, who're  supposed to debate ideas, surrender to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their suppression?  Let's be  honest.  Who here thinks your professors can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  say what they really  believe?  It scares me to death, and should scare you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  too, that the  superstition of political correctness rules the halls of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reason.  You are  the best and the brightest.  You, here in the fertile
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cradle of American  academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  River, you  are the  cream.  But I submit that you, and your counterparts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  across the  land,  are the most socially conformed and politically silenced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  generation  since  Concord Bridge.  And as long as you validate that ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  abide it ...you  are  - by your grandfathers' standards - cowards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Here's another  example.  Right now at more than one major  university,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Second Amendment  scholars and researchers are being told to  shut up about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their findings or  they'll lose their jobs.  Why?  Because  their research
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  findings would  undermine big-city mayor's pending  lawsuits that seek to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  extort hundreds of  millions of dollars from  firearm manufacturers.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  care what you think  about guns.  But if  you are not shocked at that, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  shocked at you.  Who  will guard the raw  material of unfettered ideas, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not you?  Who will defend  the core value  of academia, if you supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  soldiers of free thought and  expression lay  down your arms and plead,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;Don't shoot me.&quot;  If you talk  about race, it  does not make you a racist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If you see distinctions between  the genders,  it does not make you a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sexist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   If you think critically about a  denomination, it does not make you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  anti-religion.  If you accept but don't  celebrate homosexuality, it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  make you a homophobe.  Don't let  America's universities continue to serve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  incubators for this rampant  epidemic of new McCarthyism.  But what can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  do?  How can anyone prevail  against such pervasive social subjugation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  answer's been here all  along.  I learned it 36 years ago, on the steps of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the Lincoln Memorial in  Washington D.C., standing with Dr. Martin Luther
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  King and two hundred  thousand people.  You simply ... disobey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Peaceably, yes.  Respectfully,  of course.  Nonviolently, absolutely.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  when  told how to think or what to  say or how to behave, we don't.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  disobey  social protocol that stifles and  stigmatizes personal freedom.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  learned the awesome power of  disobedience from Dr. King ... who learned it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  from Gandhi, and Thoreau, and  Jesus, and every other great man who led
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  those in the right against those  with the might.  Disobedience is in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  DNA.  We feel innate kinship with that  disobedient spirit that tossed tea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  into Boston Harbor, that sent Thoreau to  jail, that refused to sit in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  back of the bus, that protested a war  in Viet Nam.  In that same spirit, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  am asking you to disavow cultural  correctness with massive disobedience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rogue authority, social directives, and onerous laws that weaken personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  freedom.  But be careful  ... it hurts.  Disobedience demands that you put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  yourself at  risk.  Dr. King  stood on lots of balconies.  You must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  willing to be  humiliated ... to  endure the modern-day equivalent of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  police dogs at  Montgomery and the  water cannons at Selma.  You must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  willing to  experience discomfort.  I'm  not complaining, but my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decades
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of social  activism have taken their toll  on me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Let me tell you a story.  A few years back I heard about a  rapper named
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Ice-T who was selling a CD called &quot;Cop Killer&quot; celebrating  ambushing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  murdering police officers.  It was being marketed by none other  than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.  Police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  across the country were outraged.  Rightfully so-at least one had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  murdered.  But Time/Warner was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for them, and the media were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  black.  I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Hills.  I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.  What I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  there was against the advice of my family and colleagues.  I asked for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  floor.  To a hushed room of a thousand average American stockholders, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  simply read the full lyrics of &quot;Cop Killer&quot;- every vicious, vulgar,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  instructional word.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS  TURNED OFF
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'M ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'M ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS  OFF...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It got worse, a lot worse.  I won't read the rest of it to you.  But trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched faces.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Time/Warner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their  shoes.  They hated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  me for that.  Then I delivered another volley of sick  lyric brimming with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  racist filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing  two 12-year old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nieces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of Al and Tipper Gore.  &quot;SHE PUSHED HER  BUTT AGAINST  MY ....&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them.  Let's  just say I left
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  room in echoing silence.  When I read the lyrics to the  waiting press
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  corps, one of them said &quot;We can't print that.&quot;  &quot;I know,&quot; I  replied, &quot;but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Time/Warner's selling it.&quot;  Two months later, Time/Warner  terminated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Ice-T's contract.  I'll never be offered another film by Warner's,  or get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  good review from Time magazine.  But disobedience means you must  be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to act, not just talk.  When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  herself ... jam the switchboard of the district attorney's office.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  your  university is pressured to lower standards until 80% of the  students
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of regents.  When  an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the playground and gets hauled  into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  court for sexual harassment ... march on that school and block  its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  doorways.  When someone you elected is seduced by political power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  betrays you...petition them, oust them, banish them.  When Time  magazine's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy Christians  holding a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cross
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as it did last month ... boycott their magazine and the  products it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  advertises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So that this nation may long endure, I urge you  to follow in  the hallowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  footsteps of the great disobediences of history  that freed  exiles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;founded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the  hands fan  aroused rabble in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  arms and a few great men, by God's grace,  built this  country.  If Dr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;King
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  were here, I think he would agree.
