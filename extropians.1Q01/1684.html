<p>The thing with the publisher is that they are typically desperate to
<br>
maximize ad revinues on web content, since there are typically no
<br>
subscription revinues. They want you going to their main page so they
<br>
get you to receive the maximum number of ad 'impressions' possible
<br>
between entering the site and receiving what you want. You may notice
<br>
some publishers seem to make links excessively long to deep content.
<br>
This interferes with emailing the link to people, so it winds up being
<br>
less work for the recipient to just go to the main page and click
<br>
through to the content.
<br>
<p>If they were smart, they'd do what search engine sites do and charge
<br>
extra to advertisers wanting to focus their bought impressions toward
<br>
browsers who are focused on keywords that are relevant to their
<br>
business.
