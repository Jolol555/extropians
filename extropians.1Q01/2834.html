<em>&gt; &gt; I don't have a problem with the old and feeble being paroled...such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; British 1950's organized crime figure who was recently paroled about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; month before his death (cancer I believe).  Perhaps *very* occasionally in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the face of overwhelming evidence that the prisioner has turned his life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; around and no further good is ocomplished by incarceration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There may also be other rare circumstances for parole...possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; participation in dangerous medical experiments?  Though the bioethicists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have ruled that one out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prisons are sad.  Imprisoning each of the 2 million prisoners costs American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxpayers about 60,000 a year each, not to mention prison construction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor costs.  Two million times 60,000 is 120,000,000,000 dollars a year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe the cost per prisoner is actually only 15,000 dollars a year, which it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not, then it would cost thirty billion dollars, a year.  Perhaps these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers are lower and higher, but they are illustrative.
</em><br>
<p>The average cost is around $35,000. The $60,000 figure is for death row
<br>
inmates specifically. Either way, for most non-violent prisoners who are
<br>
not mentally ill, some say it would be cheaper to just cut them a check,
<br>
or maybe not. It costs around $60,000 a year per beneficiary to run the
<br>
welfare system (even though the average recipient only receives around
<br>
$10,000). So as long as they are not on death row, prisoners actually
<br>
are cheaper than if they were on welfare on the outside.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American has the highest rate of imprisonment of any democratic country, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is absolutely pathetic.  Even ninety-nine percent of extremely violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offenders are not violent ninety-nine percent of the time.
</em><br>
<p>The second sentence here is a non-sequitur. It makes no logical sense in
<br>
the argument. Just as a genius only needs to be brilliant once to be
<br>
regarded as such, a killer only needs to kill once to deserve the death
<br>
penalty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not having been imprisoned, I wouldn't want to be.  Not being a criminal, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see less reason to imprison anyone.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, you don't have the sort of moral flexibility and
<br>
initiative criminals do. You can't imagine why they do the things they
<br>
do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I was a high school student, the debate topic for the year was prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcrowding, and how to resolve it.  Plans included decriminalizing drugs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We argued for the complete year the entire issue of prisons.  The other annual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate topics were space and the elderly.
</em><br>
<p>I say cordon off selected areas of the country. Structure social
<br>
services they depend on to only have offices in those selected areas.
<br>
Essentially set up communities such that criminals typically only kill,
<br>
rob, or hurt other criminals. Oh, yeah, we already have those. They are
<br>
called cities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes this list talks about &quot;transparency&quot;, where for example public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cameras help deter crime.  Here's how it should be, all the on-duty cops and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prison guards are videotaped regularly, and only them, as it can be expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they would be in the vicinity of crime reports.  This video wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to the general public, nor any other public or private entity, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be available to any court proceeding.
</em><br>
<p>How about this: weld a camera around the neck and embed a transponder
<br>
and taser into the skull of anyone convicted of a felony.
