<p><p>This is a pretty bizarre attitude toward libertarians and libertarian

thought.  It is not in a libertarians interest to live among a group of
<br>
simpletons that cannot generate that much value to trade nor appreciate
<br>
value, nor be counted on to understand enough of the world to be
<br>
reasonable neighbors.  This does not mean that a libertarian believes
<br>
taking away resources by force from some to redistribute via government
<br>
to others will resolve the problem.  But poverty of human intellect and
<br>
acheivement is not in a libertarian's interest in the least.  Our
<br>
ability to reach Singularity and to transcend limitations is highly
<br>
dependent on a critical mass of skilled and knowledgeable people.  That
<br>
mass being sub-critical can screw up everything and literally condemn
<br>
humanity to extinction.
