When you're writing a paper, the rule is that you don't appeal to emotion;
<br>
an appeal to emotion indicates that an idea cannot be supported by appeal
<br>
to rationality.  The idea of appealing to an emotion or intuition as a
<br>
*valid shortcut* for the rational argument is neither widespread nor
<br>
popular.  An appeal to emotion can be used to prove wrong ideas as easily
<br>
as right ideas, so the scientific community is very reluctant to appeal to
<br>
emotion for any reason; it seems (intuitively, ironically enough) to fall
<br>
under &quot;the end does not justify the means&quot;.  How could you be sure that
<br>
you were resorting to an emotional appeal as a cognitive isomorph of the
<br>
full rational argument, and not because your argument was weak, or because
<br>
you gave into the temptation to manipulate the audience?  You'd need to
<br>
know - not abstractly, but perceptually - the complete cognitive structure
<br>
of the emotional appeal.  Evolutionary psychology is neither advanced
<br>
enough, nor widespread enough in the scientific community, for
<br>
technophiles to feel confident of competence in that domain.
<br>
<p>So technophobes, who don't even have the concepts to describe those kind
<br>
of scruples, much less be bound by them, can tear the living daylights out
<br>
of technophiles on television; a technophobe can fire off ten strongly
<br>
resonating arguments in the time it takes a technophile to describe vis
<br>
initial assumptions.
<br>
<p>If the scientific community decides that it's okay to argue emotionally,
<br>
technophilia will win a lot more political arguments.  But there would be
<br>
a cost to the effectiveness of the scientific community at large.  So far,
<br>
there are only a few speakers experimenting with the idea that it is
<br>
possibly to ethically argue using a deliberate understanding of emotional
<br>
and intuitive structure.
