<p>Thanks for clarifying your position on that. I am in full agreement with
<br>
you. However, I am concerned
<br>
with this: how do we accomplish limiting the ability of one gang of
<br>
thugs (&quot;the government&quot; in this case)
<br>
without leaving things so wide open that another gang of thugs (perhaps
<br>
a &quot;corporation,&quot; perhaps the
<br>
&quot;greens&quot; or &quot;anarchists&quot;) can just move in and take over? It is at this
<br>
nexus of change that I see the
<br>
most potential danger, which is why I am cautious about pronouncing any
<br>
one action a solution.

<p><em>&gt; Not necessary, as anyone with military experience can tell you,

</em><br>
<p>Thanks, this is much more clear now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remove government's ability to do so, and corporations will be

</em><br>
<p>This seems naive to me, but I honestly hope you are right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question with India is to ask if it is in better condition than if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the British had never dipped their hands in, no matter how selfishly.
</em><br>
<p>How can either one of us decide this? Isn't this really only something
<br>
that each individual Indian can
<br>
answer for him or herself?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All of the problems that India has, in my view, tend to be problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused by cultural practices remaining that predate the British era.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Left uninfluenced, India in my view would have currently become a rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty combination of Balkan politics and African chaos and brutality.
</em><br>
<p>Again, how can we really say? The deed (colonization) is already done,
<br>
and the complex system we are left
<br>
with is too slippery to get a handle on. Perhaps you're right about what
<br>
would have happened to India if
<br>
left uninfluenced, but since that cannot now happen, there's really no
<br>
way to know. Maybe the individuals
<br>
of that country could have solved their own problems. With the added
<br>
burden of colonization to overcome,
<br>
it's not surprising at all that many of the old problems still remain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a Scot whose family was brutally persecuted and forcibly removed from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Gordon lands after Culloden, shipped to Nova Scotia and left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abandoned, I would never claim that the British colonial mentality was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any way considerate of individual rights or cultural heritage.
</em><br>
<p>I'm glad we agree on this. Since I share an almost identical heritage
<br>
(my ancestors were also from Scotland and ended up in Nova
<br>
Scotia), maybe you can understand why I won't give them any slack. I
<br>
extend this attitude to all
<br>
oppressors, even if it's my own people or myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I think its rather indicative that survive assimilation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British colonized nations tend to be far more civil and humane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals than groups left to their own devices.
</em><br>
<p>Are you actually saying that people in colonized nations would be less
<br>
civil and humane if they had been
<br>
left to their own devices? That for some reason they aren't as &quot;well
<br>
behaved&quot; as we are? I don't want to
<br>
believe it, but sometimes it really seems like you are suggesting that
<br>
some people (yourself, for
<br>
example) can and should be left to their own devices but that other
<br>
groups of people (pre-colonial
<br>
Indians, for example) should be colonized. Again, it sounds to me like
<br>
you are defending imperialism,
<br>
which is a form of oppression and removes individuals' liberty. This
<br>
seems to contradict your libertarian
<br>
position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most all of native american deaths occured during the Conquest period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when conquistadors were not only completely unaware of the cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diseases that killed off millions of natives in virgin field epidemics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were typically hundreds if not thousands of miles away from most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the deaths when they happened. Calling this genocide is like accusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some ancient Babylonian of genocide for playing with rats.
</em><br>
<p>Since I never mentioned the Native American deaths that were due to
<br>
epidemics, it seems odd you would
<br>
bring this up. Of course this isn't genocide, just a sad side-effect of
<br>
an already bad situation. I am
<br>
referring to the deaths that can be attributed to the direct actions of
<br>
the conquerors, and I would use
<br>
the term genocide for quite a number of specific incidents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; How is any form of serfdom irrelevant? To claim that's it was okay for one group to conquer another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because they're not quite as bad is ludicrous. Aren't all forms of oppression wrong? We see to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agreeing here, but I feel like you're clinging to something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clining to the idea of being humane versus inhumane. Its not all black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and white. Do you claim that Jefferson was an abominable criminal for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owning slaves?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm with you on the humane over inhumane idea. I'm glad to hear
<br>
this. And I would never claim it's
<br>
all black and white. Quite the contrary, which can be evidenced by
<br>
looking at my other posts. Looking at
<br>
things only in black and white terms is one of the things I am objecting
<br>
to here. Again, I think we are
<br>
in agreement, but that you won't let go of your defense of imperialism.
<br>
If you believe that denying
<br>
individuals their liberty is wrong, why can't you say that imperialism
<br>
was wrong for doing this despite
<br>
the fact that centuries later we can point to some positive things that
<br>
grew out of it? As for Jefferson,
<br>
well, no, I wouldn't call him an &quot;abominable criminal.&quot; That's too
<br>
simplistic. I prefer to honor him for
<br>
the good things he did, while at the same time recognizing that slavery
<br>
was wrong, he participated in it,
<br>
and is therefore responsible for his actions. He denied other human
<br>
beings their liberty by owning them,
<br>
was intelligent and educated enough to know it was wrong to do so, and
<br>
yet did it anyway. This doesn't
<br>
make him an abominable criminal, especially when taking into account the
<br>
larger culture in which this
<br>
took place; it just makes him wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why do you feel the need to label me a communalist when I have never once claimed to be one? This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not only counter-productive, it is insulting. And to compare me to a Calvinist/Puritan is laughable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm about as far from that position as Pluto is from the sun. If I said something that honestly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indicates this to you, please point it out to me and I will be happy to clarify it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to cling to this idea, like many on the left, that government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is good and private individuals are prone to do evil things if left to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own devices, so government of some sort is needed to save them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from their own corruption. This is crap.
</em><br>
<p>Since I've not once made the claim that government is good and private
<br>
individuals are prone to do evil
<br>
things if left to their own devices, I'm confused as to why you would
<br>
say this. If you read my posts here
<br>
you will not find this anywhere. This seems more like an empty retort
<br>
than an actual substantive
<br>
observation. Why do you feel the need to respond this way? I'm not
<br>
attacking you. I'm merely trying to
<br>
have a sincere discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope I am wrong in my impression of you, but it seems ludicrous to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that someone could claim that a group like a corporation, which has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherent rights in and of itself, is more prone to commit evil acts than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some group like a government, which is duly delegated power by all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals in society, which is the body that empowers corporations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do the things they do. Anyone who feels thus can only logically do so if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they posess some innate distrust of the individual as an evil creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in need of restraint.
</em><br>
<p>You are wrong in your impression of me. Please read my posts more
<br>
carefully. I've never once said that a
<br>
corporation is more prone to do evil, just that they can and sometimes
<br>
do commit evil acts. And, of
<br>
course, this is always in collusion with whatever government in in
<br>
power. I'm just saying I'm not ready
<br>
to totally blame government for all of our ills, any more than I would
<br>
be willing to blame any one group
<br>
or cause. The world is a complex system, and we humans have made it even
<br>
more so. Thus I always try to
<br>
look at things from as many angles as possible, rather than trying to
<br>
fit what I see into any one
<br>
ideological box.
