</em><br>
<p>Granted, there are no purely capitalist systems in existence.  One 
<br>
could probably argue that there never have been purely communist or 
<br>
capitalist systems in existence, because some absolute definition 
<br>
isn't being obeyed.  For example, in &quot;Communist Russia&quot;, there were 
<br>
those who had more money, power, and influence than others because of 
<br>
their positions.  Inequities like that would seem to be disallowed 
<br>
within a purely communist society.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Neither capitalism nor communism appears to be consistent with human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nature as it exists today.  Communism fails due to the human tendency to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be lazy and to get as much as possible with as little work as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Capitalism fails due to the human tendency to be envious and to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intolerant of great differences in wealth and power.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you're redefining &quot;fails&quot; here.  communism fails in the 
<br>
sense that the whole society stagnates.  Innovation and productivity 
<br>
fall to levels that are incapable of supporting the society as a 
<br>
whole.  Even at Russia's height, the toilet paper lines were long, 
<br>
and medical care - though available - was poor, by western standards.
<br>
<p>The failure that you mention for capitalism is more of a failure of 
<br>
capitalism to dominate and overcome democracy.  It's hardly an utter 
<br>
failure like experiments in communism have been.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So let me ask your rhetorical question back at you.  Why do capitalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and such attempt to treat communists with such disdain &quot;when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have never been able to show even one success after all these years?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just curious.
</em><br>
<p>Instead of pretending that there are absolutes in the world that we 
<br>
can look at as examples, I think that it's important for us to 
<br>
examine the spectrum from predominately communist societies to 
<br>
predominately capitalist ones.  At one end of the spectrum, you have 
<br>
the former Russia and China.  At the other end, you have the United 
<br>
States.
<br>
<p>In which ways do the opposite ends of the spectrum even compare?  I 
<br>
don't think that it's beating our own drum to say that the US is, 
<br>
overall, the most desirable place to live in the world.  Immigration 
<br>
statistics alone make that fairly clear.
<br>
<p>As such, I think that those who decry communism in an offhand way 
<br>
while trumpeting capitalism actually do have an argument for doing 
<br>
so.  It's not simply a matter of perspective as your post implied.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
