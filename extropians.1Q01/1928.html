</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Compared to the state of the art, maybe 20 years ago? It must have matured
<br>
since then, or something...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Surely not compared to Windows which to this

</em><br>
<p>??? Are you talking about NT5, or Win3.1?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; VMS was halfway

</em><br>
<p>Not that I have a lot of experience with that; before my time.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying Windows is any better. However, you can't claim the moral
<br>
high ground with either of these operating systems. Not that there is any
<br>
highground to be taken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, I've been working with MS stuff for years now. I love
</em><br>
it.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I love the win32 world. It's pretty. Some of the variants are even
</em><br>
halfway
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decent operating systems. The tools are wonderful. The finished products
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beautiful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A bit of pretty GUI level stuff is enough heh?
</em><br>
<p>Ooh, but it is, it is. I do so love a mouse and some eye candy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about the broken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basic environment?
</em><br>
<p>I don't use it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What of the quite poorly constructed MFC?
</em><br>
<p>I don't use it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; DLLs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really nice, but they were much better in OS2 which is a much superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating system to Windoze to this day.
</em><br>
<p>OS2... that was an operating system, right? mmm, I remember that. Funky gui.
<br>
<p>Of course, dlls are a low layer these days, with COM and COM + and all that
<br>
goodness perched on top. And it is damned great stuff!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Which tools are wonderful?
</em><br>
<p>Delphi... Delphi is the light and the w... sshh, I don't have religion,
<br>
really...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The C++ environment?
</em><br>
<p>Nup; none of the C++ environments are any good, as far as I know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is more or less acceptable as an IDE except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it produces massive bloat and takes hours to compile decent sized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects and doesn't give anywehre near adequate reflection or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cross-cutting abilities.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that killed a project I was working on, some time back (well, killed my
<br>
involvment in it, anyway). They converted to Delphi (people do learn after
<br>
all), and now the compile time is unmeasurably quick, rather than an hour on
<br>
a PIII.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And since MS doesn't really support file
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soft-links it is a bit of a problem sharing build components among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of a team.
</em><br>
<p>Unless you use a decent set of tools which cope with that. I do have to
<br>
agree with you on soft-links; that is sooo missing from MS stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Visual Basic I already talked a bit about.
</em><br>
<p>Spit, spit, VB must die. It wont though; the VB problem in 10 years (maybe
<br>
beginning now?) will be like the COBOL problem now (or is it fixed now?).
<br>
Don't throw out those VB5 books, guys, they'll make you a LOT of money
<br>
(more, that is) in coming years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; J++, MS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to steal Java in front of everyone, with an interface straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of Visual Basic?  Is this your idea of a wonderful tool?
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools have you actually worked with?
</em><br>
<p>Some, some. Lots of office stuff, some years ago (yechh), happily I then had
<br>
a long spell using Borland tools, and now I'm doing ASP stuff. No, the tools
<br>
for ASP are not so good, although I do like the little cheapy text editor
<br>
(editpad).
<br>
<p>Depends on your definition of tools, though. I mean, as well as IDEs, all
<br>
the other stuff... database tools, editors, the luvely browser, graphics
<br>
tools, you know, all the stuff you run and use when you are building a
<br>
system. Actually, I must admit that a good proportion of the tools are my
<br>
own (thanks Delphi).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you know Smalltalk and Lisp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IDEs (back when they were still common)?
</em><br>
<p>Nope. They were common? On Earth?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly what are you comparing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to? Only the command line?
</em><br>
<p>No, no, no, to all the horrible tools I used in various unix guis &amp; in
<br>
character mode over 10 years at uni (I kid you not), and in my stint working
<br>
on unix. Also to the stuff from the DOS days (although Turbo Pascal is still
<br>
a favourite).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the CLI has all the power despite not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being friedly.
</em><br>
<p>That must be why I never deleted it from my system. I also never deleted the
<br>
registry editor. But I do use each sparingly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; GUIs are nice, don't get me wrong, but they only do what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the designer of the GUI driven interface set them up to do.
</em><br>
<p>One of the reasons I love the GUI is that I use decent tools to code up my
<br>
own utils, very quickly, to do exactly what I want to do, and to have a nice
<br>
interface to boot. I'm not saying everyone should do this, although we are
<br>
comparing to an OS which expects you to recompile the kernel now and again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh yes, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be able to add to it with a Visual Basic subset.
</em><br>
<p>Wash out your typing fingers with soap! Actually, it's probably a good use
<br>
for VB.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But that is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little compared to having true access to the entire environment the GUI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements were build from as you do in Smalltalk and some of the Lisp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IDEs.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean here. Most decent (non script) environments in
<br>
Windows give you
<br>
full access to the OS, then render that unnecessary in all but the most
<br>
extreme situation (except
<br>
visual C, which requires it for virtually everything)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if you want to produce COM components (which I admit are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good thing generally although not as good imho as CORBA) then you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go write them in some other language, usually C++, rather than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much touted VS Basic.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, you can produce COM components in VB quite easily, with
<br>
restrictions. I hear that
<br>
VB even has pointers these days, although that just sounds like a recipe for
<br>
stupendous
<br>
disaster.
<br>
<p>You can use visual C++ to produce COM components; the hello world equivalent
<br>
will take
<br>
a month to code up, and another month on top of that to compile.
<br>
<p>Or you can pick decent tools.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, .net may/will change this.  But it is rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too little, too late.
</em><br>
<p>I've no idea about .Net . That'll be one of those changey things I was
<br>
skiting about being on top of, a few emails back. I'll go read up on it now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And all of these tools are owned and locked tight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by MS, which quite clearly does not have the best interests of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers or the software world in general as a major goal.
</em><br>
<p>Best interests of programmers? A lot of wealthy coders will tell you
<br>
otherwise. MS is stripping a lot of money out of other companies, and
<br>
handing it to coders, with their software development tools.
<br>
<p>The software world in general; well, that's another story. I don't think I
<br>
can talk about the &quot;software world in general&quot; without a definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are closed up means many of the best minds will not get a chance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build from them unless they sell out to the great MS.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Here, you are confusing MS's development tools and their OSes, which are
<br>
entirely different things. I'll talk about that more below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Other than my pro MS bias, and a deep affection for Borland's Delphi, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't have any particular alliegance to products/languages/etc. Whatever
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessary to get the job done. It's the thing you are trying to achieve,
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the tools you use to achieve it with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is not one tool in Delphi or MS that has not been done and done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better in Lisp and Smalltalk ages ago.
</em><br>
<p>How is this relevant to anything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; COM components and components
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally come close but that was taken straight (well actually very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; round-about) from DEC DCE protocol and was MS attempting to define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself separate from the rest of the world and true component
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interoperability using CORBA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So they based it on something good? Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The couldn't own CORBA and sure weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to offer any bridges to it.  Not that CORBA is pretty either.
</em><br>
<p>I've never checked it out; I'll do so one of these days. How about the java
<br>
beans stuff? What do you know about that; it's in the same space, is it not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A final bit of ranting... while lots of people have said that
</em><br>
ASP/IIS/ETC is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a bad way to go (and even bad from a saleable job skills sense, weird),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone's been putting forward a different point of view. I would put
</em><br>
it to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you all that none of us has the big picture. The IT world is truly
</em><br>
immense
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these days; is it just possible that each of us is dwelling in his/her
</em><br>
own
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; private little (very large) world, and not considering views/truths from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outside that domain?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I look at it differently.  It is up to moral programmers
</em><br>
<p>(rotflmao)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a vision of how we could do things far better than we do now to choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tools that they believe are the best and to use those successfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on enough projects to give them continuing life and dominance and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make room to develop the next set of tools and the next after that until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we develop tools that take over their own development largely.  I got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into this business to change the world, not just to give this or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company what some manager is asking for today.  I and others like me are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not done yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Good on you. That's tops, really. I don't think I've ever heard that point
<br>
of view espoused before, by anyone who has worked in private industry for
<br>
more than a couple of years and still has a job. Certainly, I have renounced
<br>
my faith (once it was very strong). Not only for it's impracticality, but
<br>
because I saw people not do things my way, go down the &quot;wrong&quot; path, and
<br>
actually succeed. It occured to me that the techie-purist point of view
<br>
might not be the end of things, after all, and perhaps, instead of being put
<br>
on Earth to right the evils of ignorance in everyone except myself, that
<br>
maybe other people might have a point, or know more than me, or better than
<br>
me, now and again.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Sorry, that was unnecessarily inflamatory.
<br>
<p>Here's something more constructive...
<br>
<p>You must differentiate between Windows, and Microsoft's development tools. I
<br>
must point out that I only ever use MS's own tools grudgingly, because they
<br>
seem to be crappy in almost every circumstance.
<br>
<p>- VBA is good as a macro language for applications, but silly people think
<br>
they should build real apps out of it, in Excel or Access, or von Neumann
<br>
help me, Word.
<br>
<p>- VBScript sucks dogs bollocks (can I say that here?)
<br>
<p>- VB is a great tool for untrained coders. It's good for writing hello world
<br>
programs in, very good efficiency in terms of coding time for that purpose.
<br>
Also, if you have commissioned excess bandwidth on your corporate network
<br>
and are worried that you wont be able to justify it to the board, an
<br>
enterprise license for VB in the hands of your developers is just the
<br>
ticket.
<br>
<p>- Visual C is designed by Satan, to look like the most powerful tool for
<br>
development ever conceived, while actually being the most powerful tool for
<br>
creating broken apps and sucking development money. Unless the Incredible
<br>
Exploding Application is what you were setting out to build in the first
<br>
place...
<br>
<p>- Visual J? Never used it. I haven't seen anyone running through the streets
<br>
screaming their devotion, though.
<br>
<p>However, SQL Server I do love; version 7 is fabulous. I don't know what DBAs
<br>
think of it; I know it requires you to replace the Oracle style architecture
<br>
of a couple of beasty servers with a cluster of zillions of little,
<br>
cantankerous machines.But from a developer's point of view, it's pretty
<br>
damned good. The tools are sweet, too.
<br>
<p><pre>
---
<p>I did use Borland C++, as I've noted previously in this email, for a project
which was tight for time and money; big mistake. It looks just like Delphi,
except it is MANY orders of magnitude slower in compile time (a project
killer in itself), the language is dirtier and the support for stuff like
COM is primitive (templates... urgghhh), and is full 'o' bugs.
<p>Borland Delphi is sweet, beautiful, GUI based and proud. I have never, ever
used a better development product. It has it's quirks, as does anything, but
the language is clean (unlike C++), powerful (unlike VB), and the compiled
proggies run like a bat out of hell. I've seen a couple of projects moved
out of C++ to Delphi now, and they both ended up in huge performance gains,
faster development time, and much more malleable code, plus far less
crashing.
<p>Whenever I'm feeling depressed with coding in something shitey these days, I
fire up Delphi and throw together that latest little utility that I've been
meaning to get around to. Aaahhh.
<p>---
<p>Nowadays I'm writing ASP to talk directly to a database. We're not using a
middle tier :-(, but jscript, as the scripting language, is turning out to
be incredibly efficient (compared to how I expected it to perform); I wrote
a SQL Server -&gt; Oracle sql translator so that we could support multiple dbs
more easily, and I never notice any performance hit, which is surprising
because I never designed for speed, and I'm pretty sure the thing is
computationally intensive.
<p>It is sad to be using cruddy tools again; coding in a text editor; but
things are improving. For instance, the debugger for ASP which comes with
Windows 2000 is pretty good, as a debugger. I think it's supposed to be an
editor too, but on that front it is so bad that I can't be sure if that is
it's purpose. Also, database access is like playing with lego, now that ADO
is around; it's almost too easy.
<p>Something lovely to see is the multitude of COM objects which come with the
standard install, which do all kinds of good stuff, from pretty low level OS
things right up to high level commands, like sending email or running
netmeeting.
<p>I'm really happy with the current state of the Microsoft OSes, although I
wish they could finally drop the 9x kernel. They're good to program on. They
do lots of great stuff for you.
<p>But their development tools suck hard. Fortunately you can replace them very
easily. I particularly love the replaceable scripting environments these
days; as well as jscript and vbscript, you can get components for heaps of
other scripting languages (eg: Python), which can then be used in ASP, for
the Windows Scripting Host (replaces batch files), for your own apps (add a
scripting language to your app as easy as clicking your fingers), you can
even compile COM components using them, without any development tool other
than a text editor... actually, you might have to download a freebie from MS
to do that.
<p>----
<p>I'd like to know other Windows developer's favourite development tools.
Anyone use Powerbuilder (I've heard goodish things about it). Any others
people like? There are a lot of serious languages/environments out there, so
that one need never resort to visual (hah hah) C.
<p>---
<p>That's all.
