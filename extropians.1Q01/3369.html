<p>
I recently came across this recently in an article on bias in hiring
<br>
practices:
<br>
<p>&quot;Accounting for Unintended Bias
<br>
<p>Even among the most well-intentioned of individuals, the possibility of
<br>
unintended bias is present. That is, without knowing that he or she is
<br>
doing so, those responsible for hiring may favor someone that  looks
<br>
like us  (for whatever definition of  us  is relevant). The hiring
<br>
managers may select a superbly qualified person who looks different in
<br>
contrast to an adequately qualified person who looks the same, but the
<br>
bias is most likely to come out in a choice between two nearly equally
<br>
qualified individuals.
<br>
<p>Steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of unintended bias as a
<br>
general rule, these steps involve separating the dimensions on which an
<br>
individual is evaluated from personally identifying (and irrelevant)
<br>
characteristics. Of course, such a separation is not always possible
<br>
(e.g., when an individual's ability to work in a team is being
<br>
evaluated), but it is possible more than it is practiced.
<br>
<p>The impact of such steps can be quite significant. For example, in
<br>
hiring musicians, symphony orchestras require applicants to audition.
<br>
All auditions are  live,  but some orchestras conduct them with the
<br>
applicant behind a screen that prevents the judges from seeing the
<br>
musician. In doing so, the music that the applicant plays the relevant
<br>
part of the audition is separated from the irrelevant characteristics of
<br>
the applicant s sex, race, and age. Goldin and Rouse find that the use
<br>
of screen increases by 50 percent the probability that a female musician
<br>
will be advanced from certain preliminary rounds and increases by
<br>
severalfold the likelihood that a female musician will be selected in
<br>
the final round.&quot;

<p><p>The report also contains a number of other fascinating statistics.  For
<br>
example, according to (Schmidt and Hunter, 1998) years of education and
<br>
years of job experience correlate poorly with measures of actual
<br>
on-the-job performance: 0.10 and 0.18, respectively.
