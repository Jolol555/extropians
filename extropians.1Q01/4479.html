<p><em>&gt; I don't agree that the cut from bone to satellite was meant to show them

<em>&gt; as not just tools, but as weapons.  Although in the book there was mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of orbiting weapons platforms, these really aren't depicted in the movie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Going by what we see on the screen, we can't make that connection.
</em><br>
<p>You are, of course, perfectly right that the movie imposes no necessary
<br>
interpretation of the purpose of these satellites.  In fact, the Bizony book
<br>
has a sketch of a cylindrical satellite that's similar, but not identical,
<br>
to the the first one that appears after the cut from the bone, with the caption:
<br>
&quot;Kubrick ordered many designs for orbiting nuclear weapon platforms from Lange
<br>
and Masters.  This drawing shows a version that actually made it to the shooting
<br>
stage, as one of the first spaceships that appears on the screen [not quite,
<br>
though it may have been a sketch that ended up getting worked up into the
<br>
model that actually does appear on the screen].  Anxious to avoid
<br>
too many associations with _Dr. Strangelove_, however, Kubrick decided not
<br>
to make it so obvious in his film that this expensive and delicate artifact
<br>
of space was a war machine.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real point of the bone-to-spaceship cut... is that the road from one to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other was mapped... by the intervention of the monolith...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the cut is a flash from one end to the other of the path.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I appreciated the commentary emphasizing Kubrick's sense of irony...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The conversation in the lunar bus en route to the monolith is especially forced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the real explanation is that these people are terrified inside but don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want anyone to know.  They are covering it up with their hearty conversations about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ham and chicken, then lining up for pictures like tourists.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's a generous interpretation of what otherwise seems like dull
<br>
unimaginativeness (but then again, only from the **outside** -- from the cosmic
<br>
perspective that Kubrick's eye and camera are affording us).  On the other
<br>
hand, if these guys routinely handle stress with ham and chicken sandwiches,
<br>
then there must be some high-tech weight loss technology lurking in the
<br>
background that Kubrick and Clarke didn't show us ;-&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The comment that Floyd's speech had really given a boost to morale has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always bothered me.  Floyd's speech can hardly have had that effect.  His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech was in reality quite chilling. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Floyd is not only stonewalling, he is in effect threatening them by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requiring security oaths.  As I recall the scene, I had the impression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the guy who asked the question was going to tagged as a trouble-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maker and he'd be in for some hard questioning later.  Floyd's pleasant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chuckle is masking an iron-hard control being enforced by the government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His friendly face is a lie, and everyone in that room must have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chilled and frightened by his implicit threats.  (And the undercurrent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fear in the lunar shuttle may have been in part fear of Floyd and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those he represents.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this scene always makes me grind my teeth, too.  It's a very
<br>
effective portrayal of the smooth, almost casual application of
<br>
coercive power by a bureaucrat who's obviously an expert at it.
<br>
I've often wondered if I would have the cojones to simply say no
<br>
in those circumstances.  Of course, the result would be a foregone
<br>
conclusion -- fired, shipped back to Earth, stripped of whatever
<br>
security clearances you might have, and blackballed from employment
<br>
with any high-tech government contractors.  And you'd **still** be
<br>
subject to arrest if you opened your mouth, regardless of whether
<br>
you'd signed the piece of paper.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Despite the suggestion that Kubrick is being ironic in his long, loving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shots of the space ships, I think he did mean them to be appreciated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a positive way.  The use of the Blue Danube waltz, the ballet of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ship and space station and lunar colony, everything in slow motion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choreographed with the music, is one of the most beautiful scenes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its type.  I think this art is meant to be enjoyed for its own sake,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and there's no reason to think he is trying to undercut it with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ironic message.
</em><br>
<p>Oh absolutely -- this film works on many levels, and the ironic level
<br>
by no means undercuts the aesthetic level.  I **love** the sequence
<br>
in which the Pan Am shuttle docks with the space station to the accompaniment
<br>
of the Strauss waltz.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One final comment.  I can't agree with the characterization of Hal as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;chatty, fussy genius&quot; or that he is more human than the human characters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal is consistently calm and unemotional, very limited in his degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of expressiveness.  It is true that the human astronauts are not much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different, but my take on this is that Kubrick is showing that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronauts have become like computers.  They, in effect, have copied Hal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Hal's designers have copied them.  Convergent evolution.
</em><br>
<p>I think the one conversation that manifests what Gilliatt was getting
<br>
at is the one where HAL butters up Dave Bowman by asking to see his
<br>
sketches of the hibernating astronauts (and flatters him a bit on his
<br>
technique), and then proceeds to draw him into a cozy, conspiratorial
<br>
conversation about the mission:
<br>
<p>HAL:  Good evening, Dave.
<br>
<p>DAVE BOWMAN:  How ya doin', Hal?
<br>
<p>HAL:  Everything's running smoothly.  And you?
<br>
<p>BOWMAN:  Oh, not too bad.
<br>
<p>HAL:  Have you been doing some more work?
<br>
<p>BOWMAN:  Hm, few sketches.
<br>
<p>HAL:  May I see them?
<br>
<p>BOWMAN:  Sure.  (Sits down in front of one of HAL's
<br>
cameras, holding up his sketch pad and turning the pages).
<br>
<p>HAL:  That's a very nice rendering, Dave.  I think you've
<br>
improved a great deal.  Can you hold it a bit closer?
<br>
<p>BOWMAN:  Sure.
<br>
<p>HAL:  That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?
<br>
<p>BOWMAN:  Mm hmm.
<br>
<p>HAL:  By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal
<br>
question?
<br>
<p>BOWMAN:  No, not at all.
<br>
<p>HAL:  Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive, but during
<br>
the past few weeks, I've wondered whether you might be having
<br>
some second thoughts about the mission.
<br>
<p>BOWMAN (a little stiffly):  How do you mean?
<br>
<p>HAL:  Well, it's rather difficult to define.  Perhaps I'm just
<br>
projecting my own concern about it.  I know I've never completely
<br>
freed myself of the suspicion that there are some extremely odd
<br>
things about this mission.  I'm sure you'll agree there's some
<br>
truth in what I say.
<br>
<p>BOWMAN:  Well, I don't know, that's a rather difficult question
<br>
to answer.
<br>
<p>HAL:  You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave?
<br>
<p>BOWMAN:  No, not at all.
<br>
<p>HAL:  Certainly no one could've been unaware of the very strange
<br>
stories floating around before we left.  Rumors about something
<br>
being dug up on the moon.  I never gave these stories much credence,
<br>
but particularly in view of some of the other things that have
<br>
happened, I find them difficult to put out of my mind.  For instance,
<br>
the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security,
<br>
and the melodramatic touch of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball, and
<br>
Kaminsky aboard, already in hibernation, after four months of separate
<br>
training on their own.
<br>
<p>BOWMAN (a bit stiffly, again):  You're working up your crew psychology
<br>
report.
<br>
<p>HAL (slightly embarrassed sounding):  'Course I am.  Sorry about this.
<br>
I know it's a bit silly.
<br>
<p>HAL's use of colloquialisms -- &quot;stories floating around&quot;, &quot;something
<br>
being dug up on the moon&quot;, and even the hint of disrespect toward management --
<br>
&quot;the melodramatic touch&quot; should be **extremely** effective psychology
<br>
to seduce somebody into a confidential mood, especially somebody who
<br>
hasn't been seen to have had much recent casual conversation.  Dave isn't having
<br>
any of it, though -- he assumes (probably correctly) that HAL is
<br>
a management spy (in fact, that would be a pretty good reason for
<br>
Dave and Frank being so close-mouthed around each other, knowing their every
<br>
word and inflection would be picked up and analyzed by the computer.  Not very
<br>
healthy mission psychology).  Of course, it's entirely possible (an interpretation
<br>
certainly encouraged by Clarke's novel and the _2010_ sequel, both book and movie),
<br>
that HAL also had a genuine desire to come clean with his human crewmates, even
<br>
if his overriding goal, as Dave surmised, was simply to work up his crew
<br>
psychology report (HAL's psychosomatic difficulties with the AE-35 unit begin
<br>
**immediately** on the heels of this conversation).  All victims of Heywood Floyd
<br>
and the Agency gang (though _2010_ lets Floyd off the hook and passes the buck to
<br>
higher levels).
<br>
<p>It would be **really** freaky to have a conversation with an AI as Turing-effective
<br>
as HAL is portrayed to be in this conversation -- the social signalling would be an
<br>
overwhelming temptation to let down your guard and anthropomorphize the hell out of
<br>
the machine.  At the same time, there would be tremendous cognitive dissonance
<br>
if you had any inside knowledge of the true motivational structure of the AI,
<br>
and an expert's appreciation of its alienness (as, no doubt, Dave Bowman would).
<br>
Again, a recipe for high stress and a potentially disastrous psychological
<br>
environment.  I suppose people who profile serial killers for a living have
<br>
to live with seeing the **people** around them as potentially alien in this
<br>
way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The commentators missed what has always struck me as the saddest part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Hal lobotomizing scene: that Hal, while pleading for his life in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throes of utter desperation, is unable to put real emotion into his voice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Stop, Dave.  Please stop,&quot; he says, in the same calm, even tones that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he has used throughout.  His designers have deprived him of the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; element of humanity which might have saved him in the end, the ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to project emotion.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I find this scene very moving, and rather difficult to watch.
<br>
There was an episode of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ last night with a
<br>
female robot in it (created as the perfect lover by a graduate of Sunnyvale
<br>
High who's gone on to technical college :-&gt;, but which has been abandoned by
<br>
its creator because it's too perfect).  After a battle, Buffy and the girl
<br>
robot sit on adjacent swings in a playground while the robot's battery finally
<br>
runs down, and Buffy talks to the dying robot, reassuring it that its
<br>
creator will return.  Strangely effective, in that offbeat Buffy way.
<br>
The robot's voice becomes slower and lower in pitch as it dies, like HAL's
<br>
(of course, the metaphor in both cases is a wind-up phonograph running down).
