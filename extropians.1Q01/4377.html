<p>However, such a scheme would work far better if we were honest about it being
<br>
redistributive and treat it as a matter of tax accounting, rather than many
<br>
complex social programs that try to impose behavior on people through social
<br>
engineering. The 'earned income tax credit' is a start on this, where
<br>
redistribution is in fact just a matter of tax accounting. My little brother, for
<br>
example, has had about $1400 withdrawn from his income this past year but is
<br>
getting $3700 in his tax return, none of which has been wasted on nanny-state
<br>
bureaucracies. The unfortunate thing is that you HAVE to have dependents in order
<br>
to get this sort of a tax return, so its an incentive to breed poor kids.
