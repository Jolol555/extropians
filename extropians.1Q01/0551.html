<p><p><p><em>&gt; I am as worried by bad arguments as bad ethos (which I deny utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the way) .... and I will ruthlessly pursue the same to destruction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not a personal thing, I am totally detached, as when I play in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chess tournaments .. win the game first, have a drink with the loser in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bar afterwards.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we all know you -think- you're a Vulcan, but the question remains, are
<br>
you, indeed, a Vulcan?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The markets, since you draw attention to them, are a prime example of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies marketing their own particular brands in direct competition.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you're missing my point.  I'm talking about the value of internal
<br>
cooperation.  (AND competition-- both are necessary.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yes, but we are trying for truth-statements, not a compromise for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sake of it.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  But as I've indicated, I'm not asking anyone to sacrifice the
<br>
truth, but rather to start realizing we probably don't have a monopoly on
<br>
it.  I'm talking about the process-- about approaching an opponent's post in
<br>
a different way-- it is currently clear that we are very good at discovering
<br>
the flaws and not so good at (or interested in) illuminating rightness.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Sure, I welcome any feedback on MVT, critical or otherwise, which throws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new light on the issues and helps this field to make progress. But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is also important to refute wrongs and linguistic obfustification, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this means hitting at peoples' cherished beliefs and self-image reliant on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular bits of their internal dialogue. Dan was inaccurate to accuse
</em><br>
me
<br>
<em>&gt; of name calling, but I apologise if I have caused anyone emotional turmoil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by challenging deeply held convictions.
</em><br>
<p>Keep challenging, that's fine.  I'm glad that you're doing this.  But it
<br>
might be refreshing to see people restrain themselves from constantly
<br>
seeking the -worst- possible interpretation of an opponent's arguments.
<br>
IMO, this often shows insufficient respect for the intelligence at the other
<br>
end of the discussion.
<br>
<p>BTW, I'd like to make it clear that I believe that most people are guilty of
<br>
shaky ethos.  As a result,  I am not inclined to take very seriously those
<br>
who utterly deny it.  Our posts are littered with tactics.
<br>
<p>Consider, for instance, your above statement: &quot;... I apologise if I have
<br>
caused anyone emotional turmoil by challenging deeply held convictions.&quot;
<br>
<p>One wonders if you -really- regret causing emotion via challenging
<br>
convictions, or are instead claiming that your easily upset opponents are
<br>
clinging to false beliefs, through which you cleave with the white flame of
<br>
truth.
