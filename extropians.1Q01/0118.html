</em><br>
<p>A Transhuman Fairy Tale
<br>
<p>by Anders Sandberg 
<br>
<p>Once upon a time in a land far, far away there lived a king and
<br>
queen. Their highest wish was to have a child, but for many years the
<br>
queen had remained childless.  One day one of her ladies-in-waiting
<br>
came to her and told her about the fairy godmothers of biotechnology,
<br>
who were said to be able to help childless mothers using their magic
<br>
spells. The royal couple visited the glass and steel castle of the
<br>
godmothers, and a few months later the queen bore a child.
<br>
<p>The happy parents invited all the fairy godmothers to a great
<br>
celebration in their castle. After a splendid dinner where the court
<br>
held long eulogies over the skill and power of the godmothers, they
<br>
gathered around the young princess and began to tell the parents about
<br>
what they had given their daughter: genes for good health,
<br>
intelligence, beauty, slimness and a predisposition for a charming
<br>
personality.
<br>
<p>The godmothers were just telling about the wonderful genetic switches
<br>
they had inserted so that the princess could for herself activate some
<br>
of the clever spells in her body when the thirteenth godmother burst
<br>
into the castle. The court had failed to invite her due to a computer
<br>
error, and she was furious. She pointed at the princess and told the
<br>
others that it was she who had created the genetic switch that
<br>
controlled the telomerase production; without it the princess would
<br>
develop cancer due to an inherited predisposition and die. With an
<br>
evil laugh the evil godmother ripped the optic disc containing the
<br>
sequence for the controlling protein into pieces and vanished in her
<br>
black porsche.
<br>
<p>The godmothers explained to the horrified parents that there was
<br>
nothing they could do; discovering how to unlock the switch would
<br>
require unravelling the entire genome of the princess and solving the
<br>
generalised protein structure problem, and even the spells of the
<br>
godmothers could not change all her DNA once she was born. But the
<br>
twelfth and youngest godmother, who so far had kept silent since she
<br>
was just a research intern, spoke up. She told the parents that she
<br>
had inserted a few amphibian genes &quot;just in case&quot;: if the princess
<br>
ever got too sick they would begin to produce carbohydrates and
<br>
proteins enabling a cryonic suspension. She would lie frozen until
<br>
future technology could revive her.
<br>
<p>Several years went by and the princess grew up into a lovely young
<br>
woman just as intelligent, beautiful, creative and healthy as the
<br>
godmothers had predicted. Her father, still fearful of the curse of
<br>
the thirteenth godmother, had ordered the court to only serve healthy
<br>
food rich in antioxidants and low in calories, eat nutrient
<br>
supplements developed by the godmothers and forbidden smoking in the
<br>
entire kingdom.
<br>
<p>One day when the princess was alone in the castle she went exploring;
<br>
in one of the towers she found an old library, not changed since the
<br>
19th century when its illustrious owner had died. On the desk she
<br>
found a humidor, containing strangely smelling cylinders. Her mentor
<br>
AI told her it was a cigar, a drug that had once been widely used in
<br>
the kingdom. Curious and unaware of the risks she tried smoking it --
<br>
and developed lung cancer.
<br>
<p>The saddened court and the godmothers could not do anything to stop
<br>
the cancer from growing metastases, and finally they had to
<br>
cryonically suspend the princess (although being rulers over their own
<br>
kingdom, the parents could change the law so that she could be
<br>
suspended well before legal death) and placed her in a capsule in an
<br>
earthquake-proof bunker. Over the years a great hedge of thorns grew
<br>
up around the bunker, a biodefense designed by the thirteenth
<br>
godmother to make sure the princess was forgotten forever. And there
<br>
she lay for one hundred years.
<br>
<p>One day a transhuman passed by through the local nets, and found a
<br>
reference to the old story about the frozen princess. He found the
<br>
thorn-hedge, and broke through it using his disassembler nanites --
<br>
the spells of the godmother was far from cutting edge now. He entered
<br>
the silent and cold bunker, finding the capsule of the princess
<br>
covered with a thick layer of frost and dust; through the translucent
<br>
cover he could make out some vague contours filling him with deep
<br>
longing. He opened it (not minding the liquid nitrogen that poured out
<br>
since his body was covered by protective utility fog) and kissed her
<br>
with lifegiving nanites that began cell repair. She opened her eyes,
<br>
and fell in love with the handsome transhuman. He carried her away
<br>
from the bunker, and they lived happily ever after -- since the
<br>
twelfth godmother had perfected life extension therapy in the
<br>
meantime.
