<em>&gt; Solution: full disclosure? &quot;Officer, for quality purposes, I am

<p>&quot;Yes, officer, if you don't wish to be recorded, you can get back in
<br>
your cruiser and drive away. It IS your choice. If you stay, you agree
<br>
to be recorded.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; As far as video recording (not audio) goes, the courts appear to have
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; One court at least ruled that a woman trapped in a car begging to be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ride-along media recording and broadcasting not merely her image, but

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the 'no reasonable expectation of privacy' as well as the
<br>
'right of self defense' rationales could be used together for an
<br>
effective defense of recording police interactions with the public. If
<br>
you have no reasonable right of privacy, what gives the cop a reasonable
<br>
right? If you have a right of fatal self defense against criminally
<br>
violent activity by rogue cops, then recording is a decidedly non-fatal
<br>
means of self defense and should be protected activity.
