<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; But I allow myself all the mediums ... so my analysis is more complete
<br>
S&gt; than one limited to linguistic analysis...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, we've already got it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What does that completeness get you?  Does it answer some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophical questions?  Then write an article and use some diagrams.
</em><br>
<p>I prefer to make films ... music, pictures &amp; animation plus narrative &amp;
<br>
discussion. Interactive software also .... not boring linear articles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Finally, your language may be considerably less formal than English.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But then, your language is so different from philosophy as we know it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it becomes its own entity, distinct from philosophy entirely, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jazz and abstract dance are to philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>Have cut the irrelevant stuff about artificial languages .... philosophy
<br>
already consists of this .. a barrier to keep non-philosophers out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, conclusively settling the matter on an old philosophical question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and raising new ones that no one has thought of before IS quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;valuable.  But, even so, one shouldn't be under the misconceptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the language raises questions that cannot be named in English, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presents arguments which CANNOT be stated in modern philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as-we-know-it.
</em><br>
<p>I am going to argue that your whole case relies on DEFINING everything
<br>
as &quot;physical&quot; and not allowing anything to exist outside this definition ...
<br>
you can call it anti-realism or whatever, but your argument is completely
<br>
vacuous and circular. If &quot;Principles&quot; and &quot;symbols&quot; and &quot;time&quot; are physical
<br>
(ha, what rubbish) then at least you have to accept they are not &quot;physical&quot;
<br>
in the same sense of the word as rocks or brains are &quot;physical&quot; ... so what
<br>
value
<br>
has this catch-all word &quot;physical&quot; ... none at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, my physicalism denies that symbols are anything more than their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical part.  e.g. Writing is nothing more than scratches on paper.
</em><br>
<p>So all scratches on paper ARE writing? Ridiculous!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The words which I've sent to you are nothing more than bits on a disk,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;signal down a wire, glowing phosphors on a screen, and are also stored
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the layout of our purely physical brains.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My physicalism denies that there is some non-physical meaning-object
</em><br>
<p>Who apart from a philosopher would talk about &quot;meaning-object&quot; in
<br>
order to deny straightforward &quot;meaning&quot; ... I bet you do not use this
<br>
garbage-speech in normal conversation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;which is out there somewhere, attached to the word.  The word has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use, an effect on ourselves and others, but nothing more.
</em><br>
<p>Not &quot;out there&quot; anywhere , this is just a lame assumption that everything
<br>
is physical again .... ideas are properties of the mind (phantom pineal
<br>
eye) so do not need physical extension.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes.  Principles are arrays of physical symbols, which may be stored
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the physical brain.
</em><br>
<p>I have looked though the OED and other dictionaries to see if I can
<br>
find anything like your description ... but, *no* ... surprise surprise,
<br>
all the accepted definitions are something like &quot;&quot;a source, root,
<br>
origin: that which is fundamental: a theoretical basis: a faculty of
<br>
mind: a source of action:a fundamental truth on which others are
<br>
founded or from which they spring &quot;.... and more of the same.
<br>
<p>Are you claiming your strange definition is correct and *everybody*
<br>
else including the Oxford English Dictionary is wrong?
<br>
<p>S&gt; I don't think you are using &quot;metaprogram&quot; in the accepted
<br>
S&gt; psychotherapeutic sense here, but are changing the idea to try
<br>
S&gt; and fit with your philosophical bias. Brains can not only change
<br>
S&gt; their &quot;programming&quot; but can reconfigure their own *hardware*
<br>
<p>The brain can't *arbitrarily* change its hardware.
<br>
<p>The brain is very plastic and continually forges new connectivity ..
<br>
the *physical neurons* change ... and not just signal routes. Do
<br>
you deny this? How can ontogeny occur at all by your account?
<br>
<p>I&gt;t's obviously
<br>
<em>&gt;restricted by the laws of physics, but it also suffers from many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more restrictive limitations.  The Turing machine has some obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limitations, but the fact that it can't change THOSE doesn't mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's not just like a brain (in all the relevant ways).
</em><br>
<p>But it isn't like the brain in ANY way ... the brain is distributed
<br>
parallel.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;More to the point, you say that the brain changes its &quot;hardware.&quot;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that the very changes which you call changes in &quot;hardware&quot; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really changes in &quot;software.&quot;  They're software because they CAN be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changed internally.  The hardware is, by definition, the stuff that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has to be changed externally.
</em><br>
<p>You persist with the old hardware/ software language that just doesn't
<br>
cut it when examining neural computers .... there is not software, just
<br>
weight-states ... evolution sculpts the response directly.
<br>
<p>S&gt;So, I'm not telling you that the brain's circuitry is analogous to the
<br>
S&gt;circuitry of a Turing machine, but that the brain's hardware, the part
<br>
S&gt;that cannot be changed internally, is equivalent to the Turing
<br>
S&gt;machine's hardware.
<br>
<p>There is not a scrap of evidence for this ... what studies do you cite here?
<br>
And which parts of the brain are you saying are non-plastic?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, I want to remind you that I don't share those &quot;feelings&quot; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you.  I'm an anti-realist about feelings.  We should reinterpret them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as purely physical.
</em><br>
<p>Why *should* we do that ... why adopt such ludicrous and anti-intuitional
<br>
way of talking .. nobody actually does this. I can make equally as strong a
<br>
case
<br>
that the physical is an epiphenomena of the mental, and that everything is
<br>
an &quot;illusion&quot; and that nothing is physical .... but I would rather assume
<br>
that
<br>
both physical AND non-physical entities can happily co-exist. MVT allows
<br>
me that ... I am not forced to adopt such extreme and unwieldy positions as
<br>
either materialism or idealism (both worn-out philosophical jargon worlds).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But, once we do that, yes, I take it that this discussion, as all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other (philosophical?) discussions, relies inherently on &quot;intuitions.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But that doesn't mean that the discussion ends here.  I suspect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we agree enough on our intuitions that by drawing attention to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right sorts of facts we can come to agree on the same conclusion, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least clearly identify in what way our intuitions diverge.
</em><br>
<p>But my intuitions are strongly against your physicalism ... which I think is
<br>
a pointless tautologous ploy. And we both accept in broad terms the
<br>
empirical facts about the atrophy of the pineal eye and emergence of
<br>
consciousness/ conscious behaviour *in direct inverse relationship* to the
<br>
loss of the physical pineal eye.
<br>
<p>All you are saying is that there is a lessening only in *degree or type* of
<br>
physicalness ... that the phantom effect of the pineal eye is less physical
<br>
than the actual cellular structure that has gone ... whereas I take the
<br>
further view that abstract images can only be formed by an abstract
<br>
sense-organ (memory of physical organ, if you like). The language differs,
<br>
but maybe this is not a significant difference .. the philosophy and its
<br>
jargon just gets in the way here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; Time is the *measurement* of movement in space .. therefore
<br>
S&gt; must be subjective because measurement is integral, not
<br>
S&gt; incidental to the concept of time. There is no &quot;time&quot; out there
<br>
S&gt; that you can point to  ... it is just a concept ... not physical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My incapacity to point to something doesn't mean that it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical.  But no matter.
</em><br>
<p>I think you have big problems here ... the  essence of being physical
<br>
seems to be that there *should* be something you can point to, or at
<br>
least detect by the instrument of physics. Without any objective evidence,
<br>
your claim to the physicallness of such &quot;unpointable to&quot; things is weak
<br>
at best ... and is eminently challengeable by idealists and others.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not picky about whether time is merely
<br>
<em>&gt;the measurement or whether there's something to measure.  This has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing to do with the fact that holes have places, whereas feelings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the ordinary mental realist sense, don't.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, both are illusions, holes have locations ... but also feelings
<br>
can be &quot;in my guts&quot; or elsewhere .. just different, internal places.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, I'll just adopt this phenomenologist strategy to answer you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point above, then.  Time may be a measurement, but it's a &quot;physical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measurement, whatever &quot;physical&quot; means.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Physical&quot; here might mean &quot;hallucinatory&quot; or &quot;mental&quot; .... fictional
<br>
even? What exactly do you mean by &quot;physical&quot; since you use it
<br>
to describe some very, very different things. Can one thing be
<br>
&quot;less&quot; physical than another? If so, then you have a scalar system,
<br>
and at one extreme of the scale will be &quot;non-physical&quot; things.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Sure, except that the only knowledge you have of the hole is
<br>
S&gt; indirect, via your feelings/ perceptions/ logical reasoning and
<br>
S&gt; depth perception &amp;c. The illusion of the hole has an illusionary
<br>
S&gt; location .. there isn't any &quot;hole&quot; independent of the illusion, or
<br>
S&gt; if there is it is impossible to know. Same with any so-called
<br>
S&gt; &quot;physical objects&quot; .. but MVT idealism explains how the illusion
<br>
S&gt; is produced. I don't need to deny the existence of physical objects,
<br>
S&gt; maybe they are there, or maybe we hallucinate them, who knows
<br>
S&gt; and who cares. The physical brain is necessary, but not sufficient
<br>
S&gt; for consciousness. A self-referential  and abstract component is
<br>
S&gt; needed in order to interact with the world of symbols &amp; abstraction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, you cannot get away from this problem by using idealism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because you still have all the same problems, slightly modified for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idealism.  What's the connection between sensations-of-brains and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sadness?  How can you solve the problem of other minds with idealism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All you have access to is sensations of their behavior, and of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brains.  How can you conclude that they have a mind on that basis?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, which is why (if you have ever read any of my MVT publications) I
<br>
am careful to avoid identification with any of the philosophical camps ...
<br>
I trot out the idealist position just to counter your physicalist
<br>
assumption,
<br>
but I actually think the distinction between phyical and mental is blurred,
<br>
the shape of the body changes the shape of the mind, and the shape
<br>
of the mind affects the shape and action of the body (Aristotle).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You might be taking a page from the anti-realist's book and say &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot be wrong about there being a mind there, because the mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself is on the same ontological level as an illusion.  If I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there's a mind there, then there's an illusion of a mind there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so there's a mind there, because a mind is just an illusion of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, this is the pointless circularity of philosophy divorced from
<br>
facts and observations of nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But then I can make a similar move back in the physical realm: &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can't be wrong in making belief statements about minds, because having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a mind is just the same as our 'believing' that there's a mind there.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Again, scare quotes to remind you that I'm reinterpreting 'belief' to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be purely physical.)  This, obviously, is just the Turing test: if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;seems&quot; to have a mind to us, then it does.
</em><br>
<p>Just word games, absolutely content-free!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you didn't find the Turing test satisfying, then you shouldn't find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your &quot;mind-as-illusion&quot; account satisfying.  Both are &quot;psychological,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever we think that means, but neither of them hit the nail on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;head in conversation with a dualist.
</em><br>
<p>I have a scalar view which is actually neither physicalist, idealist or
<br>
dualist .... MVT is adequate on all explanatory accounts, whereas your
<br>
fictional and unbuildable Turing machine view is no better than a
<br>
medieval supernaturalist account .... you have no evidence.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I don't accept that &quot;consciousness&quot; is a handy term for a physical
<br>
S&gt; phenomena at all ..
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Fine.  But don't accuse me of contradicting myself, because when *I*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use the word &quot;consciousness,&quot; I'm referring to physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;characteristics.
</em><br>
<p>But when you refer to absolutely anything at all you must prefix &quot;physical
<br>
characteristics&quot; .... so what. I make a distinction between &quot;physical minds&quot;
<br>
when talking of E-2 animals controlled by their phyical (cellular) pineal
<br>
eye,
<br>
and &quot;non-physical&quot; or &quot;abstract&quot; minds in the E-1 case where no cellular
<br>
structures remain. How to you propose to word this distinction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No strictly *chemical* effects, but the &quot;psychological&quot; effects are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical effects.  The placebo has an indirect physical effect to cure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the patient, by making the patient &quot;think&quot; that they are being cured,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and, for example, relieving stress, and bolstering the immune system.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;All physical all the time.  The placebo effect *is* physical.
</em><br>
<p>But your epiphenomenalism has to show that everything runs exactly
<br>
the same whether people can &quot;think&quot; or not, and the placebo case
<br>
clearly refutes this. &quot;Thinks&quot; is a consciousness term.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Yes, but when I say them I mean what I say, and when you say them
<br>
S&gt; they are packed  together with a unwieldy bunch of provisos &amp;c. in
<br>
S&gt; that you should really qualify each statement before using it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No.  I take the stronger view that my definition is right, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yours is wrong.  It's you, I argue, who should qualify your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about feelings to point out that you don't just mean the physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff, but something MORE.  But until we agree about this, we'll just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to interpret what the other says with charity and humanity.
</em><br>
<p>But your definitions (of &quot;Principles&quot;, see earlier) do not exist in any
<br>
dictionary ... they all support my, generally accepted, definitions.
<br>
<p>S&gt; There is less work for the hypnotist .. but yes, works either case.
<br>
S&gt; The point I am making is for the primacy of the mental/ conscious.
<br>
S&gt; If I suggested to you under somnambulistic trance that I was burning
<br>
S&gt; a cigarette stub on your hand, not only would you experience it,
<br>
S&gt; but might well manifest burn marks! (See placebo effect argument).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Still, it would all be physical.  Physical words would affect my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical brain, which would affect my physical body.
</em><br>
<p>The sound, or written symbol, of the word I can accept as &quot;physical&quot;
<br>
under the normal usage of the term, but not the &quot;meaning&quot; or
<br>
interpretable content or significance, &quot;that thought which is conveyed&quot;
<br>
by the word.  Can you make this distinction, or is the &quot;meaning&quot; as
<br>
physical to you are the air-wave/ sound or light-wave/ image?
<br>
<p>S&gt; Where is this program located? Or do you just mean cultural
<br>
S&gt; conditioning and things you have learnt or been told?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the brain.  It is encoded in the layout of the neurons and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;connections, just as computer code is encoded in the layout of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transistors on a chip.  The program is there.  It can be changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;externally, by culture, experience, etc. but the program is there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just as a robot's program is on its hard disk.
</em><br>
<p>But no one can read the internal state of a neural computer
<br>
because it is a dynamic system ... the memory does not &quot;exist&quot;
<br>
as stored until some hook or other activates a state similar to a
<br>
previous pattern that evokes a &quot;memory&quot;. I think you are confusing
<br>
&quot;program&quot; with &quot;constraints&quot; .... a neural computer &quot;learns&quot; by exposure
<br>
to lots of examples .. and makes its own patterns from these ..
<br>
<p>This is how a humanoid infant learns to talk .. by being talked to ..
<br>
and listening to voices in the world, and NOT by being given a
<br>
book on the rules of grammar or a English primer. Same with neural
<br>
computers ... no programmers or software .... just reward for correct
<br>
and absence or reward for wrong, and it figures out the patterns for
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It only answers Leibnitz as well as functionalism does.  But if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understood the objections against functionalism, you'll see that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still haven't captured what mental realists want to capture about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;feelings.&quot;  To have certain physical capacities is not to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feeling.  It's easy to imagine someone with (or without) those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capacities who has or doesn't have feelings.  They're different in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definition, in principle.  And you haven't explained the link.
</em><br>
<p>The link is in the identification with phantom pineal eye sensation
<br>
as &quot;self&quot; owned or originating .... we &quot;own&quot; our thoughts and feelings
<br>
&nbsp;in a  way that your robot cannot, it is a closed physical system, whereas
<br>
we have a &quot;non-cellular&quot; component.
<br>
<p>S&gt; The abstract, phantom pineal eye is not physical in the same way that
<br>
S&gt; the pineal gland is physical: thus it could interact ....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure, not physical the same way capacities are not physical.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's not enough.
</em><br>
<p>The whole-part fusion of physical brain with phantom organ of generic sense
<br>
is enough to provide us with an experiential gestalt, we can reintegrate
<br>
action-potential signals into the whole experience because our brains
<br>
instantiate a sensor out of the very same type of action-potential signals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But as for Turing equivalents, computing in parallel is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equivalent to a big fast Turing machine (that is, equivalent in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way they behave, which is what I said above).  The brain can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reconfigure some &quot;hardware,&quot; but there is other hardware that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain cannot reconfigure.  That hardware is equivalent to the hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the Turing machine cannot reconfigure.  Everything the brain can
</em><br>
r&gt;econfigure can be simulated on a big fast Turing machine.
<br>
<p>But you cannot move from &quot;can&quot; to &quot;does&quot; ... so your speculation
<br>
carries no more weight than the supernaturalists, perhaps the
<br>
Scientologists who think we are possessed by Thetan demons ..
<br>
both accounts work in theory to cover any potential type of experience,
<br>
but neither are true in practice.
<br>
<p>Start from the phenomena, look at how the brain IS constructed, and
<br>
the case that the brain is a neural computer (or cluster of) is irrefutable.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Furthermore, and the key point, they aren't CONSCIOUS but
<br>
S&gt; we are ... our neural wetware is capable of manifesting non-physical
<br>
S&gt; components and the associated phantom illusions ... do you claim
<br>
S&gt; that Turing machines could have, then lose but remember, a pineal
<br>
S&gt; eye (or any other body part come to that). I think not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When we design a functional human-equivalent AI, it will obviously be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Turing equivalent.  Will you be in the camp of philosophers who will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insist that it still cannot be conscious?
</em><br>
<p>Go ahead and do it ...... if you can. But even if you achieve it YOU still
<br>
deny it can be &quot;conscious&quot; because of your strange physicalist beliefs.
<br>
And you are talking only about a &quot;human EQUIVALENT&quot; .. I and MVT
<br>
are talking about the real things and how they actually DID evolve, not
<br>
some simulation fiction!
