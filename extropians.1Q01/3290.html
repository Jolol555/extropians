Well, if there was a recording of the police actions from the time they sighted
<br>
the car throughout the course of their duty, then there might be less profiling,
<br>
because anyone pulled over could later legally request the record.
<br>
<p>I've heard that before, from newspaper articles and stuff like that.  I don't
<br>
have any stories of my black friends getting harrassed.  I might have heard
<br>
some.
<br>
<p>Generally, the police have enough to keep them busy.  If there are things like
<br>
&quot;arrest quotas&quot; then those are bad.  If they don't have enough things to keep
<br>
them busy, then we don't need so many.
<br>
<p>The presence of police is kind of like insurance.
<br>
<p>Another problem with law enforcement is that it involves dealing with the people
<br>
that break the law.  Sometimes that is good if a kid is scared straight, but it
<br>
is bad sometimes and there is corruption.
