<em>&gt; Also, effects that some folks on this list can contemplate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equanimity are events that would horrify many people outside of extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sci-fi/technophilic circles.  For example, Eliezer Yudkowsky has said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on many occasions that, as long as the human race survives long enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give birth to some sort of superintelligence, the ultimate fate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity is of no consequence (to him or, presumably, in the ultimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scheme of things).  I suspect that this attitude is part of what gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; folks like Bill Joy the willies.
</em><br>
<p>My view of this is that it doesn't matter that much whether our
<br>
descendents are meat or metal.  Why should we be horrified by the prospect
<br>
that we will die and our machines live on, but not by the conventional
<br>
belief that we will die and our children live on?
<br>
<p>Hans Moravec calls our intelligent robotic descendents &quot;mind children&quot;,
<br>
children who are created by our minds rather than by our bodies.
<br>
We must love our bodies and hate our minds, if the progeny of one is
<br>
honored while the other is a threat.
<br>
<p>I realize that this is an area where people have strong instincts,
<br>
conditioned by millions of years of evolution and centuries of culture.
<br>
We look at a baby and see a cute little creature, while a robot is a
<br>
soulless monstrosity.  But it is surely possible to free ourselves for
<br>
a moment from these prejudices and to see the fundamental similarities
<br>
between the two.
<br>
<p>If most people have never looked at things this way, I believe it is
<br>
because they have never been presented with the argument.  Not everyone is
<br>
persuaded, of course.  But most people who laugh at or scorn Extropians
<br>
for their technophilia have never considered the issues deeply.
<br>
Over time I believe we will see more people coming to share our views,
<br>
and in fact this is already manifest in the increasing public prominence
<br>
of Extropianism.
<br>
