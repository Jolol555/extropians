<p><p>The partitioning of cities into good and bad areas is the *result* of

society dealing with the problem effectively, short of banishing all the

riff-raff to some remote colony.  These people have to go somewhere; where 
<br>
society/culture has been effective at reducing riff-raff in their midsts 
<br>
you have good areas, and different degrees of &quot;badness&quot; in the rest 
<br>
depending on how concentrated the riff-raff ejected from the good areas 
<br>
actually are.  The best solution is to let people move freely and deal with 
<br>
the problem on their own turf.
<br>
<p>Of course, it seems that you are coming from the arguably absurd position 
<br>
that &quot;bad&quot; areas don't need to exist.  Unfortunately, as long as riff-raff 
<br>
exist, you'll have bad areas because creating  the &quot;good&quot; areas also tends 
<br>
to create the &quot;bad&quot; ones.  It is pretty close to a zero-sum game no matter 
<br>
how you organize the bodies in a free society (in a non-free society, you 
<br>
have &quot;other&quot; choices for dealing with the problem).  Over the years, you 
<br>
see these dynamics happen in any city; some formerly bad areas become 
<br>
better, while formerly good areas become worse.  But I've never seen 
<br>
anything resembling a free society where all the neighborhoods became 
<br>
&quot;good&quot; without any areas becoming bad.  Riff-raff happen and they have to 
<br>
live somewhere.
