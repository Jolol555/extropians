<p>I don't know what are you saying here, and I'm certainly no nuke engineer,
<br>
but breeders are rather dangerous customers. They have no moderator/use
<br>
fast neutrons, and typically liquid sodium in the primary cooling circuit. 
<br>
Sodium melts at about 98 deg C, so you have to keep the primary coolant
<br>
hot whenever the reactor becomes critical, orelse a solid block of
<br>
sodium can suddenly block circulation, by becoming stuck inside an orifice. 
<br>
Tons of liquid sodium in the primary circuit hot enough to generate 
<br>
high pressure steam for the turbine does not strike me as especially 
<br>
safe, considering the heat exchanger surface is mechanically stressed 
<br>
due to high pressure and the hydrothermally accelerated corrosion as 
<br>
well as neutrons screwing up the lattice integrity peu a peu. These 
<br>
are very harsh conditions, and the system as a whole does not fail 
<br>
gracefully. The smallest leak would make really hot sodium meet hot 
<br>
water/steam, resulting in a very violent reaction, suddenly creating 
<br>
lots of hydrogen in a confined space. This means you'll have 
<br>
<p>a) an explosion, and probably a very large, nasty chemical fire (you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't stop the reaction easily, since in case of a leak you can't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate sodium from water), and possibly a secondary hydrogen-air
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explosion, which is easily capable of blowing the containment into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large airborne chunks
<br>
<p>b) loss of primary coolant. Can become rather painful, if you have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simultaneous case of containment breach and reactor core gone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;china, on the background of lots of pretty pyrotechnics.
<br>
<p>Also, the breeder is not well-behaved to respect to maintaining
<br>
criticality (notice that the Chernobyl accident was caused mostly
<br>
by a) highly unstable criticality in low power regime b) paradoxical
<br>
reaction to absorber rods while in that regime). Water-cooled and 
<br>
gas-cooled HTR type of reactors automatically leave criticality as 
<br>
core temperature goes up, this is not true for fast neutron breeders.
<br>
<p>In short, the breeder is a really, really hairy technology, potentiating
<br>
the classical nuke power problems. Friends don't let friends use
<br>
fast breeders.
<br>
<p>Even the supposedly benign HTR has it got its slew of problems:

<br>
generic information, superficially rather polemic:

<br>
<p>As always, Google is your friend. You can formulate your queries
<br>
better as you learn the terminology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there is 25 pounds of plutonium, then it should be kept in a secure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; container.  Any attempt to use it to generate weapons should cause it to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inert.
</em><br>
<p>Um, how do you make Pu inert, fast? By blowing it apart with a chemical
<br>
explosive, creating a cloud of micron-sized particles? By suddenly 
<br>
transmuting it?
<br>
<p>Even if you glassify it, it can still be extracted.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Any radioactive material, there should exist the method to cause it to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inert.  There might exist ways to dampen the various waves and particles of
</em><br>
<p>There's no way to make stuff inert other than by waiting a great long while
<br>
and/or dispersing the material widely, preferably burying the diluted result
<br>
in the ground.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; radiation.
</em><br>
<p>There's no way to dampen radiation other than by distance and lots of absorbing
<br>
matter between you and its source (for time being, let's ignore magnetical
<br>
traps which only work for charged particles and not on that scale, anyway). 
<br>
You're up the creek if the radioactive source has become incorporated inside 
<br>
your body. For instance, airborne iodine can wreck utter havoc with thyroids 
<br>
of people living in iodine-deficient countryside, especially young people. 
<br>
Similiarly, radioactive strontium becomes incorporated into bone apatite
<br>
along with calcium, and irradiates your bone marrow  (along with gonads,
<br>
the most vulnerable tissue type) from the closest possible distance.
<br>
<p>Notice that a molecular machine at relativistic speed also has to learn how
<br>
to deal with constant irradiation. Error-corrective encoding and constantly
<br>
rebuilding itself while separating out the hot isotopes is probably the
<br>
way to go.
