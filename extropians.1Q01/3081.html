In some states, it is broadly illegal to record someone without their 
<br>
explicit consent.  This has been recently implemented in California, though 
<br>
one has to wonder if it is more to protect the government and police than 
<br>
individual citizens.  Most people are not aware that these statutes exist, 
<br>
so people get nailed with criminal and civil penalties all the time over 
<br>
things such as recording the illegal behavior of a police officer or 
<br>
recording a phone call (which is illegal in California, even if the other 
<br>
person called you).  That you are doing it for your own protection is no 
<br>
defense.  Naturally, the government and its agents have legally exempted 
<br>
themselves from these laws.
