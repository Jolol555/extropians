John Clark forwards:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, the information that the light pulse carried (all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can know about the photons) is stored in the atomic spin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wave, waiting to be released as a light pulse that is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle identical to the incident pulse.
</em><br>
<p>Might something like this eventually be used to produce a... Hollow Man?
<br>
<p>Or an invisible aeroplane? Or an invisible building?
<br>
<p>Photons could be absorbed at one side of the building, and the information
<br>
carried over to the opposite side of the building, where the photons could
<br>
be reproduced as they were.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the hull of the building could be made such that a beam of light
<br>
would enter the hull at one side, then follow the curve of the hull to the
<br>
point opposite to the point of entry with regard to the angle of entry, and
<br>
then exit in the original direction.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the building wouldn't have to be invisible from all directions, just
<br>
from one of them; it might then be easier to construct one half of the
<br>
building's hull as a photon absorber, and the other half as a photon
<br>
emitter.
<br>
<p>Invisibility made simple. :-)
<br>
(Not.)
