<p>Actually, you wouldn't. You would probably prefer LA. Based on what I read,
<br>
that is the place where such events are most likely to happen; that, and
<br>
China. Eastern Europe lags behind quite significantly.
<br>
<p>I was rather disgusted when I read the LA Times article. Even if one gives
<br>
the police a big benefit of the doubt due to one-sidedness of the article,
<br>
it's bad enough. Reports like these are continuously strangling my desire to
<br>
ever move to the United States, as much as I once wanted to.
