<p>
The recent discussions about Islam and Extropianism prompt me to mention 
<br>
that I'm about to head over to the Milken Community High School to give a 
<br>
talk about cryonics and life extension to the special honors class there. I 
<br>
resisted agreeing to this, despite having done it several times before, 
<br>
because of my tight schedule, but finally caved in. The students at this 
<br>
private Jewish high school are the brightest and most engaged young people 
<br>
I have had the pleasure of conversing with in years. They actually 
<br>
*listen*, and ask intelligent questions. The Rabbi who invited me also 
<br>
likes to get involved in a friendly but probing way.
<br>
<p>Since a lot has happened in biotech recently, I'll try to gauge their 
<br>
responses to see how sympathetic or worried they are.
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
<p>Max
