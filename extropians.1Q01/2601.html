<p>Be careful with these kind of rumor pages.  A Whitehouse spokesman 
<br>
interviewed on CNN has already discounted many of these stories.  He 
<br>
said that the figure of $200,000 was greatly exaggerated.  He said 
<br>
that Mrs. Gore had not called or apologized.  He said many stories of 
<br>
garbage and graffiti turned out to be normal trash bags left behind 
<br>
after an office was cleaned or simple post-it notes left for the new 
<br>
occupants.  He said that many phone lines were legitimately forwarded 
<br>
to other offices as the people left.  He said that the Bush 
<br>
Administration could not confirm most of the reported stories and 
<br>
that the damage was much less than what has been reported in the 
<br>
media.  The administration will produce a full accounting to 
<br>
determine the truth.  President Bush has asked staffers to stop 
<br>
reporting these incidents to the media until the truth can be 
<br>
determined.
