that's a good one.  i call it an access restriction.  perhaps it is
<br>
evident when one responds to a complex question and the responder is
<br>
generating the answer on the fly.  however, the communication skills
<br>
should have already been integrated via past interaction, just as the
<br>
experiment had already been performed (in this example). a high
<br>
recall to generation ratio response should be apparent if a-the
<br>
responder has activated this social condition prior b-the scientist
<br>
has performed the experiment.
<br>
<p>i think scientists should have comm skills, it makes the science more
<br>
fun.  and also audience mode detection skills should increase,
<br>
providing the most optimal comm.
<br>
<p>however, i do know what you mean, Barbara.  if i am thinking about
<br>
some kind of process or am in a heavy integration mode, it is not
<br>
easy to talk to people.  it is good that the brain does not process
<br>
all at once -- total mess (at least in the foreground, 2001)
