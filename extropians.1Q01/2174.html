<p>Another aside on Robert Bunsen:
<br>
<p>Bunsen was a professor at the University here for 40-something years.
<br>
There is now a coppery-green statue largely displayed on our
<br>
Heidelberg Hauptstrasse ... The Heidelberg citizens seem to be quite
<br>
proud of the man.

<p>28 July 1999
<br>
Exhibition at Heidelberg University Museum: Robert Wilhelm Bunsen - A
<br>
Life in the Service of Science (1811-1899)
<br>
<p>One of the things everyone remembers from chemistry classes at school
<br>
is the Bunsen burner. Paradoxically, the scientist it is named after -
<br>
Robert Wilhelm Bunsen - appears to have had only a minor part in its
<br>
development.  But he was one of the most important chemists of the
<br>
19th century and his association with Heidelberg University was a long
<br>
and fruitful one.
<br>
<p>Born in Goettingen on 30 March 1811, Bunsen went to school in
<br>
Goettingen and Holzminden and then enrolled at Goettingen University
<br>
to study natural sciences and mathematics. He was awarded his
<br>
doctorate at the early age of 19 for a dissertation on different kinds
<br>
of hygrometer.
<br>
<p>Immediately after that Bunsen embarked on an extended study trip
<br>
through Europe visting all the major centres of chemical research in
<br>
Germany and France. By way of Berlin, Giessen, Heidelberg and Bonn,
<br>
Bunsen finally arrived in Paris in 1832 where he attended lectures at
<br>
the famous École Polytechnique. He returned to Goettingen via
<br>
Vienna in 1834. Only two years later he gained his Habilitation with
<br>
work on organometallic compounds. In 1836 when he was working in
<br>
Kassel he lost the sight of his right eye after an explosion in his
<br>
laboratory. Moving from Kassel to Marburg he took over the
<br>
directorship of the Chemical Laboratory there and was appointed
<br>
extraordinary professor on 7 August 1839.
<br>
<p>Bunsen's invention of the carbon-zinc electrode dates from his Marburg
<br>
period (1841), as do his experiments on the composition of gases given
<br>
off by blast furnaces. His findings were to lead to a very significant
<br>
reduction in coal consumption. In 1850 Bunsen left Marburg for Breslau
<br>
where he met Gustav Kirchhoff, another of the century's most gifted
<br>
scientists, who came to Heidelberg in 1854.
<br>
<p>In 1852 Bunsen was appointed professor at the University of
<br>
Heidelberg, where he remained until his death in 1899. May 1853 saw
<br>
commencement of the work on the Chemical Laboratory, soon to become
<br>
the largest and best-equipped lab of its kind anywhere in the
<br>
world. Bunsen's presence in Heidelberg attracted many other famous
<br>
chemists of the day (August Kekulé, Emil Erlenmeyer, Adolf von
<br>
Baeyer, Henry Roscoe) and made the University of Heidelberg one of the
<br>
major world centres of chemical research.
<br>
<p>In 1859 Bunsen and the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff collaborated on
<br>
their most significant achievement, the development of spectrum
<br>
analysis, the key to the discovery of many hitherto unidentified
<br>
chemical elements. Bunsen taught at the University until his death in
<br>
1899 at the age of 78. Nine years after his death (1908) a monument
<br>
was erected in his honour (Hauptstrasse). The second half of the 19th
<br>
century established Heidelberg's renown as the leading German
<br>
university of the age, due not least to the simultaneous presence of
<br>
three of the century's most important scientists: Bunsen, Kirchhoff
<br>
and Hermann Helmholtz.
