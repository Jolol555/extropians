<em>&gt; Further, where a series has a completion (telos),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the preceding steps are for the sake of that.
</em><br>
<p>And where no series have any completion (reality),
<br>
all preceding steps continue on into eternity, past and future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now surely as in intelligent action, so in nature;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and as in nature, so it is in each action,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if nothing interferes.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;if nothing interferes&quot; certainty subverts unnatural intelligence,
<br>
resulting in unintentional inconsequence. So it doesn't really matter. ô¿ô
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now intelligent action is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the sake of an end; therefore the nature of things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also is so.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Can'st not conceive intelligence beyond teleology? Hast not heard of
<br>
PsychonomyT?&quot;

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus if a house, e.g. had been a thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made by nature, it would have been made in the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it is now by art (techne);
</em><br>
<p>Human nature has indeed produced houses, but Aristo, baby, ya gotta see
<br>
some the new stuff they're putting up in California, and check out the
<br>
hi-techne art out in Vegas. It looks unreal, if not unnatural.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and if things made by nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were made also by art, they would come to be in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way as by nature.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily. You see, humans opt to create (or to cause the evolution
<br>
of) synthetic chemicals, artificial medicines, and so forth. These are
<br>
things made by human nature, and by artists, scientists, and experimenters
<br>
who don't always decide to do things the way nature does them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Each step then in the series is for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sake of the next; and generally art partly completes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what nature cannot bring to a finish, and partly imitates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, well, let's not get too sexist about it, OK? BTW, if the first step
<br>
is for the sake of the next, who stepped for the sake of the first?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If, therefore, artificial products are for the sake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an end, so clearly also are natural products.
</em><br>
<p>As I understand it, life does not evolve &quot;for the sake of an end,&quot; it
<br>
organizes into increasingly complex adaptations which bring increasingly
<br>
complex systems to fruition, and it does this at an accelerating rate.
<br>
Furthermore, once in a while people do things for no end at all... just an
<br>
irrational and random act of kindness. (Like this message.) So, by the
<br>
same token, if humans can act senselessly, then of course, so can nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The relation of the later to the earlier terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the series is the same in both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Aristotle, Phys. II, 8
</em><br>
<p>Well, naturally!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the science which knows to what end each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing must be done is the most authoritative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the sciences, and more authoritative than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any ancillary science; and this end is the good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that thing, and in general the supreme good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the whole of nature. Judged by all the tests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have mentioned, then, the name in question falls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the same science; this must be a science that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigates the first principles and causes;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the good, i.e. the end, is one of the causes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Aristotle, Metaph. 1, 2.
</em><br>
<p>There you go again, Aristo. Someone on this list may accuse you of
<br>
circular arguments. But who could disagree that &quot;the end is one of the
<br>
causes.&quot; Like going back to the place where you began and seeing it as if
<br>
for the first time, like deja vu over and over again, like wow... upload
<br>
this before it gets to the second principles and causes... for the causes
<br>
came from the same ends... which never proves the falsifiability of
<br>
uncertainty principles... perhaps it takes a super sentience to understand
<br>
that life without care transcends the desire to preserve it... according
<br>
to William Blake, &quot;who seeks to bind herself a joy... does its winged life
<br>
destroy... who touches beauty as he flies... lives in eternity's sunrise&quot;
<br>
... as some people have pointed out, the buddha nature that goes around,
<br>
resembles closely the buddha nature that comes around... so, the super
<br>
sentient entity would rather die than have to think about survival... what
<br>
a drag.
<br>
<p>&quot;Everything today has its point, but the art of making yourself count for
<br>
something the greatest: more is demanded to produce one wise man today,
<br>
than seven formerly; and more is needed to deal with a single individual
<br>
in our times, than with a whole people in the past.&quot;
