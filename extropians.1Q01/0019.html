<p>I too had youthful ambitions to be an architect, and in fact I went up to

the 5th year courses in the School of Architecture at UTexas. One of the 
<br>
things I had the most trouble accepting in design courses was city 
<br>
planning, which was all the rage in the late 60's and 70's. I, too, loved 
<br>
Soleri's ideas (as well as Frank Lloyd Wright's idea of parklike cities) 
<br>
but knew from experience that large-scale urban planning probably wouldn't 
<br>
work in practice and that, in fact,  tightly planned cities would probably 
<br>
be boring to live in (at least for someone like me who enjoys impromptu 
<br>
happenings).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The fundamental issue I take with Soleri's conception of an arcology is its
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Same here. However, I like to think of the principles being applied at the 
<br>
level of, say, a shopping mall (which would then become much more than a 
<br>
shopping mall) or an industrial complex. These projects are tightly planned 
<br>
from the beginning anyhow.
