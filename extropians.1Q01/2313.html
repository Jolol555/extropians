</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Is the nature of human being negotiated and conditional or is the nature
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain rights, certain fundamentals of how people treat one another,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are fundamental to the well-being of human beings based on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature.  Yes?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I deny that human nature is a given.
<br>
<p>Firstly, this is the extropians list. We're supposed to be talking about
<br>
transhumanism, right? If you postulate that human nature is fixed, we might
<br>
as well pack up and go home right now ...
<br>
<p>Secondly, one of the most unusual characteristics of the human animal is
<br>
its remarkable developmental plasticity. You can take a human neonate and
<br>
teach it to communicate in a language that no other human has ever spoken
<br>
if you get it young enough. You can make 'em behave in weird and wonderful
<br>
ways, some of them extremely self-destructive. You can also *modify* the
<br>
behaviour of adults, within some rather vague limits -- limits which are
<br>
much broader than most of us would like to admit. (The Milgram and Zimbardo
<br>
studies are a chilling example of just how far this can go.)
<br>
<p>Therefore, I do not believe that human nature should be assumed to be
<br>
constant, or that we should assume that individual humans can't be changed
<br>
out of all recognition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A nihilist would deny that there's any _point_ in negotiating with others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is no standard of reality like the nature of the entities we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are talking about to fall back on then negotiation probably is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, I don't agree with that. Why should there be no point in a human
<br>
being negotiating with an AI living in a computer simulation of a universe
<br>
where pi = 3.0?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You, for your part, appear to be as much a fundamentalist as a member of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Southern Baptist Congregations: you believe in some absolute underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Truths (either revealed by the Lawwd God Almighty, or the Singularity, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Human Nature(TM), or some other big source of revelation) against which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything can be measured. This point of view has its pros and cons, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you need to bear in mind that many other people see it as a blind spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you for the insults.  They certainly make your point more strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than your argument did.  There is nothing mystical about the notion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing creatures, us, have particular properties rather than being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever society decides somehow to define us as. 
</em><br>
<p>You misunderstand the idea of human mutability. Society can turn around
<br>
tomorrow and decide that left-handed males of jewish descent (like me)
<br>
are criminal subhumans bent on its destruction; that IN NO WAY changes
<br>
me. What it changes is *the way I interact with society*.
<br>
<p>At the same time, if you upload my mind into a bush robot, my nature
<br>
will have changed radically -- but if society recognizes non-human
<br>
intelligences as citizens, this change in my nature *doesn't* affect
<br>
my interactions with society.
<br>
<p>What you appear to be doing is assuming that society is a reified entity
<br>
that exists in its own right, and that it can dictate the terms of human
<br>
existence.  It isn't; it's simply a convenient way of representing
<br>
a gigantic bunch of one-to-one relationships that, in aggregate,
<br>
form a one-to-many relationship between the individual and everyone
<br>
around them.  It can exert social pressure on me, but it can't force
<br>
me to change. However, if I *want* to change I can, and the act of so
<br>
doing doesn't fundamentally change my relationship with society.
<br>
<p>In other words, I'm a mutable individual, not a robot subject to the will
<br>
of a collective.
