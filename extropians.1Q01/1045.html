Subject: Re: Placebo effect not physical
<br>
<p>Hi Dan
<br>
<p>Have been travelling for a while and just back ... will get a
<br>
longer reply to this mailing when have time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; This just proves my point. Not only do you define everything that exists
<br>
S&gt; or has been thought of as &quot;physical&quot; but everything that hasn't been
<br>
S&gt; thought of as well!  What &quot;uses&quot; do you have in mind, I find this
<br>
S&gt; manoeuvre pointless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Here, I think you're overlooking the difference between the physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible and the logically possible.  While it is logically possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that non-physical things exist, it isn't physically possible.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physically possible is determined by the correct laws of physics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever they may turn out to be.  The logically possible is bounded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only by the rules of logic.  It is logically possible for you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychokinetically cause a fork and spoon to dance in the air, but, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;far as we know, this is physically impossible.
</em><br>
<p>I still maintain that your argument is merely semantically.
<br>
You are saying that &quot;logical&quot; (possible) existence is not
<br>
the same as &quot;physical&quot; existence (Laws of physics) ... and that
<br>
non-physical things therefore cannot be Physical ... but you
<br>
must conflate &quot;physical&quot; with &quot;existence&quot; to deny the existence of
<br>
anything non-physical.
<br>
<p>As far as I am concerned, physical entities are composed of
<br>
physical properties (atoms and energy), so are describable
<br>
fully in terms of physics .... but imaginable (conscious or
<br>
logical) quantities might exist outside what is describable by
<br>
physics. No contradiction is entailed here. Beside, you admit
<br>
we do not really know what the &quot;Laws&quot; of physics are ... and
<br>
Heisenberg builds 'Uncertainty' into them anyway.
<br>
<p>Maybe your &quot;Laws&quot; of physics are non-physical/ non-detectable
<br>
conscious entities .... maybe the work of some omnipotent
<br>
God or Goddess ..... but surely not reducible to dust, particles or
<br>
energy? I think they are abstractions, thoughts, or concepts.
<br>
<p>If I manage to
<br>
<em>&gt;psychokinetically cause a fork and spoon to dance in the air,
</em><br>
do you then automatically want to ascribe physical causation?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The point of figuring out what is physically possible should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious to you; it has been the project of physicists and scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for centuries, and may well engage us for far longer than that.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;utility of this knowledge has proven itself over and over again.
</em><br>
<p>But fiction and the imagination has been the project of artists,
<br>
playwrights and writers over the ages .. and who can say their project
<br>
is any less valuable? I don't dispute the utility of scientific knowledge,
<br>
and am a scientist myself ... but I happen to think that your &quot;one
<br>
size fits all&quot; physicalism is a crude way of evaluating reality, and
<br>
naturally has problems with phantom limbs, MVT, and dreams &amp;c.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One characteristic of physical objects are the objects such that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physically possible that they could exist.  This does not include
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything that could ever be thought of.  Fairies, for example, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physically impossible, but could obviously be thought of.  Fairies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not physical objects: they are fictional magical ones.  They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logically possible, but physically impossible.
</em><br>
<p>Agree they are logically possible ... but not necessarily that they
<br>
are physically impossible if we consider &quot;all possible worlds.&quot;
<br>
I happen to disagree with supernaturalism in all its forms, since
<br>
a natural explanation is always better. But I am also not prepared
<br>
to use the &quot;impossible&quot; generalisation ... I want to keep open all
<br>
possibilities even if extremely unlikely and not a workable hypothesis.
<br>
In the consciousness case .. we DO all experience this (and perhaps
<br>
nothing else) ... so it doesn't require a leap of faith, like fairies or
<br>
God.
<br>
<p>MVT (strong version) fits in with a wider pattern of causation &amp; only
<br>
requires a fairly small leap of faith, but I think that your physicalism
<br>
requires an even bigger one! You must assume that Laws exist that
<br>
we don't know, and deny ANY possibility of questionable entities while
<br>
allowing logical (imaginable) reality of these same entities. It is a pure
<br>
leap of faith that all there is are &quot;atoms and the void&quot; ... no experiment
<br>
can ever show this ...
<br>
<p>S&gt; observed or detected. What are &quot;brain symbols&quot; anyway, I have never
<br>
S&gt; heard of these .....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Brain symbols are abstract entities; they're the way information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encoded in the brain.  It's intentionally pretty vague so as to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it possible to have a discussion about them without necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowing the details.  We know that the brain stores information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somehow; when we refer to brain symbols we invoke &quot;whatever it is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the brain is doing there.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I will reply to the remainder of your points in time .. but must ask for
<br>
clarification of &quot;abstract entities&quot; .... since I argue for the phantom
<br>
pineal eye as an &quot;abstract entity&quot; rather than a purely physical one.
<br>
Symbols are not physical, but you seem to be advocating non-physical
<br>
properties here .... as opposed to action-potential signals that are
<br>
clearly electro-chemical.
<br>
<p>Live long and prosper
