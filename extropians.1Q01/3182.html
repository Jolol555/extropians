I read your post and what you quoted and thought, &quot;Wow, that sounds 
<br>
bad.  Some guy was shot by the cops in LA?&quot;  But when I followed the 
<br>
link, I learned that the cops were only firing rubber bullets.  I'm 
<br>
sure they sting like an SOB, but if the guy had been shot in Kosovo, 
<br>
it wouldn't have been with rubber bullets.
<br>
<p>The whole time I was reading the article, I was wondering about the 
<br>
motivation of the police officers.  Did a riot seem imminent?  Had 
<br>
officers been injured?  Was there some type of perceived threat to 
<br>
innocent bystanders or public property?  Unfortunately, the article 
<br>
doesn't cover the police perspective except for one little quote from 
<br>
a police spokesperson.  Instead of providing any real information 
<br>
about the event that might have given a discerning reader a full 
<br>
picture of what happened, the article seemed only to pander to 
<br>
typical anti-police sentiment in the worst one-sided way.
<br>
<p>Even if you take all of the complaints as true - a dubious decision 
<br>
at best - the worst things that happened were that a woman was 
<br>
knocked down and cut her knee, and a guy lost his camera.  If that's 
<br>
all that happened and a serious riot was prevented, I say, 
<br>
&quot;Congratulations to the LAPD&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'm curious.  How can you read such an obviously one-sided article 
<br>
and reference it here as though it validates your argument?
<br>
<p>Such a wonderful news site, that laweekly.com.  A real paragon of 
<br>
journalism.  Here's a little teaser from another article they're 
<br>
running:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;President Jackass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America may want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forget and move on, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the evidence keeps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;piling up on just how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;badly Stupid George
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lost the election. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt;John Seeley
</em><br>
<p><p>Ugh,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;You wanna practice full disclosure? Here's what happened to the likes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of David Horowitz, NBC, ABC, AP, etc.--in full view of one another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do you think would happen to YOU, alone, on a lonesome road (or

<em>&gt;As one photog put it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;“There’s clear time on both sides to recognize who we are, who the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;police are and who the press is. And you know, we are supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a white flag,” Crespo said. “I was in Kosovo last year, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know, and I didn’t get shot there. I got shot in Los Angeles.”
