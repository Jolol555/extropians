<em>&gt; A post on another list that I cite and then respond to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Hayflick said that even if the most common causes of death - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cancer, heart disease and stroke - were eliminated, &quot;the increase 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in life expectancy would be no more than 15 years.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;With those death causes gone, he said, the true cause of death 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would be revealed: the aging process. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Aging, he said, is a decline on a molecular level that makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people &quot;increasingly vulnerable to disease&quot; and that this process 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is not receiving much research attention. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True in a way. But this entire argument is wrong-headed....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So obviously superlongevity will not emerge from brushing your teeth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eating right. It will come from a blend of the genome program data, fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational protein folding, and nanotechnology.
</em><br>
<p>That makes sense, and if the point of the post above was that
<br>
superlongevity was impossible, it is a good rebuttal.
<br>
<p>But Hayflick's comments may have been meant more as a caution that
<br>
progress against these specific diseases won't by itself change lifespan
<br>
all that much.  There is a good chance that we will be able to cure
<br>
cancer, but the methods used won't necessarily lead immediately and
<br>
directly to cures for other diseases.  Likewise with heart disease
<br>
and stroke.  Even once we have solved these, there will still be liver
<br>
failure, diabetes, alzheimer's, dozens of other diseases waiting to
<br>
strike us down.
<br>
<p>It's going to be a good long time before we can program nanites to go
<br>
through our bodies and find and fix any cells that aren't up to snuff.
<br>
That's a highly advanced nanotech application.
<br>
<p>But I hope and expect that many of the worst diseases we face today will
<br>
be dealt with in more conventional ways well before then.  Hayflick's
<br>
point is that this strategy can add years and even decades to our lives,
<br>
but unfortunately not that many.
<br>
