<em>&gt; In it there are several topics which relate to Extropianism and the

<em>&gt; Singularity.  One in particular that I want to mention at this time is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Personal Defender&quot;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<br>
<em>&gt; This to me seem to have several advantages....all positive over the long 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run...and only minor disadvantages in the short run...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any comments?
</em><br>
<p>One disadvantage: you'd need to ensure that there's a &quot;training model&quot;
<br>
available, or some other way for people to learn how to use the
<br>
thing. (Going to a shooting range and having your gun dye your hand
<br>
blue and phone the police is not going to appeal to many people, and a
<br>
self-defense gun that the user hasn't been trained to use properly is
<br>
a hazard to by-standers.)
<br>
<p>One possible improvement: give it a simple CCD camera (hey, you have 
<br>
that radio, right?). So when you pull the trigger, not only is it
<br>
going to call the police -- it's going to send them two photographs --
<br>
one of you, and one of whoever was opposite the business end of the
<br>
barrel.
<br>
<p>Another disadvantage: how many rounds does the thing hold? If it's
<br>
a single-shot gun, this isn't going to be an adequate guarantee of
<br>
success. If multi-shot, you run the risk of giving lone nutters of the
<br>
up-the-belltower persuasion a cheap and easy source of toys.  I can see
<br>
it being popular with street gangs as an initiation thing: give your
<br>
wannabe member a &quot;personal defender&quot;, tell him to shoot the nearest wall,
<br>
then see how well he accounts for himself when the first cops show up. 
<br>
If this happens more than a couple of times, expect most people to be
<br>
too afraid of the consequences to use such a weapon even in self-
<br>
defense (for fear of the cops arriving on the scene in the form of 
<br>
an artillery strike).
<br>
<p>Hmm. A bit of a mixed bag, all in all. Nice idea, but it doesn't solve
<br>
the personal defense problem without introducing any side-effects.
