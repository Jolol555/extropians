Here a progun extremist makes me a prophet, by calling moderates &quot;sheeple&quot;, while himself sheepily hewing to the absoutistic party line.  How ironic!
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, some here call me an extremist. I am a principled man, I try to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Yes, you have principles, but they are EXTREME ones, as are those of James Rogers and Brian Williams, your progun extremist droogies.  Too many kill who should not even HAVE guns, and too many die who should not have had to because of it.  You take their lives and deaths for granted, and pompously and self-righteously sublimate them to your anal and genital fixation on a metallic and chemical slingshot.  This is the height of IRresponsibility, but beung an extremist, you are cognitively blind to the white-dog truth of this single, simple fact.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I could easily say that those who call me extremist are themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremists: they take their alleged disinterest or moderation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremes. Those who claim to be 'moderate' are those 'good men' referred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to that permit evil to flourish because they do nothing. Now, Joe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;according to his posts, has been pretty courageous in defending abortion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights, no doubt about it. Some may say he's a bit of an extremist about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it. I would hope that such a person could be similarly courageous about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other issues in life... rather than being extremely and obsessively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moderate while demonizing others who feel as passionately about 2nd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amendment rights as he does about a woman's 9th amendment right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I am not a pro-choice extremist, but an assertive moderate (unlike your gross mischaracterization, belied by my very list presence and articulation of my positions, not all moderates are quietistic or apathetic about their stands), because, unlike you and your absolutistic, take-no-prisoners, wild-west, shoot-'em-up, everybody-pack, let-the-kids-crazies-and-criminals-get-guns stand (or at least have no laws prohibiting same) where there is room only on one side of your stance on the gun issue, there are positions on the issue on both sides of mine on BOTH the abortion issue AND the gun issue - as you well know.  People call you a progun extremist because that's what you ARE, Mikey; since you and your herd publicly bathe and revel in it on this list every frigging chance you get, even after being told to PLEEZE take it elsewhere by the clear majority here, you might as well accept that fact, live with it and deal with it - or change it.
