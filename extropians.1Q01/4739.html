<p><em>&gt;I expect the reflex reaction from some Extropians will be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accuse me of being a Luddite when I say I'm in favor of low-input
</em><br>
<em>&gt;farming. Please understand I'm not advocating going backwards to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the way things were done 150 years ago. I'm saying that, based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what I've learned so far from 51 years of being curious and poking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around to see how things work, it makes far more sense to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;UNDERSTAND natural processes and work with them to the extent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible rather than to use brute force without understanding what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one is doing. In terms of dollars, why spend $2000 for something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when you could get the same, or better, for 50 cents?
</em><br>
<p>Awhile back I posted some information about &quot;Market Gardens&quot; which
<br>
is in the same light.
<br>
<p>As a recap, market gardens are small, sometimes very small, farms
<br>
that grow things like organic vegetables and various gourmet
<br>
products for upscale restaurants in cities like Chicago. It's a
<br>
little known fact, but there is still a farm or two within the city
<br>
limits.
<br>
<p>Anyway these market gardens sprung out of people literally
<br>
supplying these products out of backyard gardens, to these small
<br>
farms. As the number of new restaurants here explodes, so do the
<br>
needs for these farms.
<br>
<p>I spoke with Charlie Trotter awhile back and he told me he has a
<br>
number of these farms on exclusive contracts. Some of his people
<br>
went out and actually recruited farms that were near foreclosure to
<br>
convert to the new protocol.
<br>
<p>They are all making considerable money.
