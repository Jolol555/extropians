The Effectiveness of Psychotherapy: The Consumer Reports Study
<br>
Martin E. P. Seligman 
<br>
University of Pennsylvania
<br>
American Psychologist, December 1995 
<br>
Vol. 50, No. 12, 965-974
<br>
<p><p>Abstract. Consumer Reports (1995, November) published an article which
<br>
concluded that patients benefited very substantially from
<br>
psychotherapy, that long-term treatment did considerably better than
<br>
short-term treatment, and that psychotherapy alone did not differ in
<br>
effectiveness from medication plus psychotherapy. Furthermore, no
<br>
specific modality of psychotherapy did better than any other for any
<br>
disorder; psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers did not
<br>
differ in their effectiveness as treaters; and all did better than
<br>
marriage counselors and long-term family doctoring. Patients whose
<br>
length of therapy or choice of therapist was limited by insurance or
<br>
managed care did worse. The methodological virtues and drawbacks of
<br>
this large-scale survey are examined and contrasted with the more
<br>
traditional efficacy study, in which patients are randomized into a
<br>
manualized, fixed duration treatment or into control groups. I
<br>
conclude that the Consumer Reports survey complements the efficacy
<br>
method, and that the best features of these two methods can be
<br>
combined into a more ideal method that will best provide empirical
<br>
validation of psychotherapy.
