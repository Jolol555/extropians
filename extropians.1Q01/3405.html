Believe it or not, a good proportion of them got into it out of a 
<br>
sense of civic duty/wanting to help people/etc. Many if not most of 
<br>
these individuals, however, are your older cops, now of retirement 
<br>
age. An awful lot of the new guys are what you describe. Another type 
<br>
is the guy who gets no respect, and figures the badge will achieve 
<br>
that. Another type is the adrenaline junkie.Then--with the idiotic 
<br>
&quot;inclusiveness&quot; hiring practices of Miami and LA, where they overlook 
<br>
red flags which would have disqualified the applicants because they 
<br>
want to hire someone in that racial category and there's a shortage 
<br>
of applicants--you wind up with, basically, criminals on patrol. Like 
<br>
Miami and LA.
<br>
<p>We need more femcops. They're much less confrontational.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there's an inescapable dilemma any society is going to face and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always has faced regarding law enforcement officials:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even when the laws are completely just, even when the only crimes are those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that actually have a victim, who is going to want to be a cop? The answer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, with rare exception I think, that the only people who will desire police 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powers are those who are prone to abuse them. Bullies, people who want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have power over others, who enjoy pulling a gun on someone and seeing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone squirm under the gun. I can't figure out any other type of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology that would make someone want to chase after and catch people, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even people who deserve it. If someone hurt someone I loved, I'd put in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of time to see that person caught, but without that emotivator, I see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only sadism as an explanation for putting so much of my effort into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;catching&quot; people. I think speed limits are good laws, but I can't imagine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting pleasure out of waiting in speed trap to ruin people's days, unless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had a predatory type of personality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only exceptions to this I can think of are tradition (&quot;my father was a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cop&quot;), which probably makes up a sizable minority of motivations for people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going into law enforcement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another possibility is as a desire to right a wrong done to them earlier in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life (like Batman - who isn't technically a cop I guess). I suspect this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't make up a strong portion of motivations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't exist in our society I think, but people may also want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become cops as a last resort when they can't find a job. I think a lot of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who join the Army do so because of this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A possible solution to this dilemma is to shift police responsibilities into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other occupations. For example, have speed limit enforcement be moved to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area of road consturction/maintenance (this may be a bad example but I can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of a better one at the moment). The people drawn to do it, then, will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be drawn for other aspects of the occupation, and not the domination aspect.
