<em>&gt;&quot;...In addition to attitudinal differences, significant productivity
</em><br>

<em>&gt;first study on the subject, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant found

<p>This is the biggest flaw in the plug-and-play mentality of some 
<br>
managers.  They think that workers with similar job titles are 
<br>
interchangeable.  They ignore the fact that 80% of a team's work is 
<br>
usually done by 20% of the team members.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;McConnell attributes most of the difference not to skill but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programmer attitude.  He recommends early design and code reviews, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;firing employees &quot;....who don't want to share their work, who won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accept teammates' suggestions, who won't take the time to review other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;team members' work-in short, team members who are generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uncooperative....&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Very true, but there is a caveat.  Someone has to be the best in a 
<br>
group.  That person should be willing to share work, but they should 
<br>
not degrade their best design by taking lessor suggestions from other 
<br>
team members.  Sometimes this can make a brilliant employee among 
<br>
idiots appear to be the problem employee.  I call this the Dilbert 
<br>
syndrome.  Dilbert always gets in trouble when he is right and 
<br>
everyone else is wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What have been you're experiences with poorly performing programmers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What did you find helped increase the programmer's productivity?
</em><br>
<p>My experience is that managers, architects, programmers, and 
<br>
debuggers are not the same people.
<br>
<p>I believe that most of the programmers can program to some extent. 
<br>
However, they may fail miserably at budgeting their resources and 
<br>
time, and will never deliver on time.  This is because they can't do 
<br>
the project management.  If a good manager would just give them 
<br>
programming tasks, they would do fine.
<br>
<p>Programmers also are not always good architects or designers.  They 
<br>
jump on a faulty design and fail to consider certain ramifications. 
<br>
They then quickly program a project, but it has problems in testing. 
<br>
Their programming was fine for the problem as they understood it. 
<br>
They merely did not see some requirements or side-effects of their 
<br>
task.
<br>
<p>Debugging is the biggest skill that effects programmers.  They can 
<br>
slap together code that seems to work.  However, when the program 
<br>
fails occasionally, most programmers do not know how to debug a 
<br>
problem effectively.  They don't know how to isolate it to a specific 
<br>
module.  They don't know how to logically test all possible 
<br>
circumstances to narrow down problem areas.  Most programmers will 
<br>
randomly read their code looking for programming errors.  A good 
<br>
debugger knows how to divide a problem environment into pieces, and 
<br>
devise tests to determine which pieces are involved with the 
<br>
problems.  They then can narrow down the problem to the specific area 
<br>
and can concentrate on finding the bug in a small subset of code.
<br>
<p>I think the key to good performance is to split up these tasks to be 
<br>
performed by different people, and to make sure they have those 
<br>
skills  Almost all companies assign a person to do a task, including 
<br>
management, design, implementation, testing, delivery, etc.  Even the 
<br>
most brilliant people in one area are rarely good in all areas.  By 
<br>
forcing people to do all phases of a project,a person is guaranteed 
<br>
to run into their deficiency area sometime.
