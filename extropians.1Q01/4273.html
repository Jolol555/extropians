<p>Swimming against the tide of gene pools
<br>
and helplessness
<br>
<p>Despite the bad news you hear, the world is full of
<br>
resilient people who lick drug and alcohol
<br>
addiction on their own, benefit from stress and
<br>
hard work, survive traumatic childhoods and
<br>
extend their lives through health-enhancing
<br>
behavior.
<br>
<p>This optimistic message comes from Albert
<br>
Bandura, the David Starr Jordan Professor of
<br>
Social Science in the Psychology Department,
<br>
whose work on &quot;social cognitive theory&quot; has won
<br>
him many honors, the latest of which was being
<br>
named honorary president of the Canadian
<br>
Psychological Association this month. Bandura
<br>
has chosen to &quot;swim against the mainstream of
<br>
negativity in the profession&quot; in recent talks to
<br>
professional associations, because, he said, &quot;our
<br>
theories grossly overpredict pathology.&quot;
<br>
<p>Take, for example, nicotine, alcohol or other drug
<br>
addictions, Bandura said. In formal treatment
<br>
programs and research studies, professionals &quot;see
<br>
the hard core cases. We have dreary relapse curves
<br>
for these programs, and so we have all these
<br>
theories about how every puff of a cigarette affects
<br>
the brain, and claims that long-term addiction
<br>
produces a brain disease,&quot; he said in a recent
<br>
interview. &quot;But 40 million people have quit
<br>
smoking on their own, so you have to ask yourself,
<br>
where is the brain disease and how did they uproot
<br>
it single-handedly? The mass of successful
<br>
self-changers is the elephant that no one sees.&quot;
<br>
<p>Similarly, Bandura said, &quot;if you look at our
<br>
theories of social pathology and then at the dismal
<br>
conditions in which children grow up in our
<br>
ghettos, you would predict that all of them would
<br>
be on drugs or psychological basket cases. Yet if
<br>
you use criteria like gainful employment, forming
<br>
partnerships and life without crime, you will find
<br>
that most of those kids make it. Their parents are
<br>
fantastically proactive in promoting their
<br>
children's competencies as well as in shielding
<br>
them from dangers.&quot; These parents, he said, are
<br>
modeling for their children a &quot;proactive mastery&quot;
<br>
of their environment, rather than the &quot;reactive
<br>
risk model&quot; of professional psychology.
<br>
<p>Medicine is another area where negativity prevails.
<br>
Our conception of health emphasizes &quot;disease
<br>
prevention, not health enhancement,&quot; he said,
<br>
even though &quot;it is just as meaningful to speak of
<br>
levels of vitality as of degrees of impairment.&quot;
<br>
Evidence shows that &quot;by exercising control over a
<br>
few healthy habits, people can live longer,
<br>
healthier lives and slow the process of aging.&quot; Yet
<br>
national efforts to control escalating health costs
<br>
&quot;do little to reduce the demand for medical
<br>
services by enabling people to stay healthy.&quot;
<br>
<p>A large part of Bandura's research has been
<br>
focused on documenting how people, by regulating
<br>
their own motivations and activities, produce the
<br>
experiences that play a major role in their
<br>
well-being. In his 1997 book, Self-Efficacy: The
<br>
Exercise of Control, Bandura explains that
<br>
individuals need to develop beliefs in their ability
<br>
to produce desired results, which usually entails
<br>
their working to develop competencies needed for
<br>
mastery and self-renewal. &quot;People who believe
<br>
they have the power to exercise some measure of
<br>
control over their lives are healthier, more
<br>
effective and more successful than those who lack
<br>
faith in their ability to effect changes in their
<br>
lives.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another way to build people's sense of personal
<br>
efficacy is to provide them with successful models
<br>
who transmit knowledge, skills and inspiration.
<br>
Bandura has helped develop clinical treatment
<br>
programs using this approach, but more recently,
<br>
he became an adviser to Click Health, a company
<br>
that markets computer games that try to increase
<br>
people's efficacy in dealing with health problems.
<br>
A game for children with diabetes, for example,
<br>
features two diabetic elephant characters who go
<br>
on a treasure hunt and survive in a jungle by
<br>
picking the right foods, regularly checking their
<br>
blood glucose level and taking insulin shots. In a
<br>
study at Stanford Medical Center, children who
<br>
used the game were four times less likely to require
<br>
urgent-care visits during the six-month study
<br>
period than those who played another game.
<br>
<p>Negative warnings are a more common approach
<br>
to health issues. Bandura illustrates this with the
<br>
example of stress, which is routinely portrayed in
<br>
journals and the popular press as bad for one's
<br>
health. Among other things, stress is said to
<br>
undermine a person's immune system. But in
<br>
research with others, Bandura found that stress
<br>
aroused while people were actively acquiring the
<br>
ability to cope with and master new situations
<br>
enhanced components of their immune systems.
<br>
&quot;Stress experienced while acquiring coping
<br>
efficacy has different effects than stress aroused in
<br>
aversive situations with no prospect of ever
<br>
gaining any self-protective control,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Neglecting the positive side of people's emotional
<br>
lives has other implications, Bandura said. Books
<br>
and articles, for example, often frame women's
<br>
recent entry into the workplace as a social problem
<br>
that undermines families. &quot;There are countless
<br>
studies on the negative spillover of job pressures
<br>
on family life but few on how job satisfaction
<br>
enhances the quality of family life,&quot; he said. A few
<br>
studies that have looked for positive spillover have
<br>
found that women's personal well-being and
<br>
health is enhanced by their sense of efficacy in
<br>
handling dual roles.
<br>
<p>Bandura traces the roots of negative bias to
<br>
prevailing theories in psychology and biology that
<br>
underestimate humans as active agents in their
<br>
own lives. Theorists saw the mind as a &quot;passive
<br>
black box&quot; and later, as a linear-processing
<br>
computer. Such theories treat people as
<br>
&quot;automatons undergoing actions, devoid of any
<br>
conscious regulation, phenomenological life or
<br>
personal identity,&quot; he said. &quot;It is the height of
<br>
irony that a science of human functioning should
<br>
strip people of the very capabilities that make
<br>
them unique in their power to shape their
<br>
environment and their own destiny. &quot;
<br>
<p>Biological theories that espouse &quot;one-sided
<br>
evolutionism&quot; also have contributed to the
<br>
negative bias, he said. They emphasize the
<br>
constraints on people's behavior based on their
<br>
evolved biological structures, without
<br>
acknowledging the other side of the co-evolution
<br>
process: &quot;People are not just reactive products of
<br>
selection pressure. Through their construction of
<br>
ever more complex environments, people are
<br>
producers of new selection pressures in the
<br>
co-evolution process. In the case of complex
<br>
human behavior, nature operates as a potentialist
<br>
rather than a determinist,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Because humans have an unparalleled capacity to
<br>
become many things, Bandura said, societies are
<br>
wise to cultivate &quot;generalizable competencies,
<br>
instill a robust sense of efficacy, create equitable
<br>
opportunity structures, provide aidful resources,
<br>
allow room for self-directedness.&quot;
<br>
<p>He urged his fellow psychologists to &quot;venture forth
<br>
to agentically humanize our psychology and
<br>
psychologize biology, forswear Prozac, and may
<br>
<p>the efficacy force be with you.&quot;
