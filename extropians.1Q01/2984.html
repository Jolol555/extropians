This from the leading popular US &quot;conservative&quot; journal.  It points to a 
<br>
scenario that I think is quite possible: The outcome of very early human 
<br>
genengineering will strike the broad front of &quot;public consciousness&quot; before 
<br>
the science and technology can provide revolutionary improvements in health 
<br>
and longevity, sparking a &quot;moral backlash&quot; that sets the entire enterprise 
<br>
back significantly.

Cloning Reality
<br>
Brave New World here we come.
<br>
<p>By Wesley J. Smith, author of Culture of Death: The Assault on Medical
<br>
Ethics in America, recently published by Encounter Books
<br>
<p><p>rave New World has arrived at last, as we always knew it would. On January
<br>
22, 2001, Britain's House of Lords voted overwhelmingly to permit the
<br>
cloning and maintenance of human embryos up to 14 days old for the purposes
<br>
of medical experimentation, thereby taking the first terrible step toward
<br>
the legalization of full-blown human cloning. Meanwhile, an international
<br>
group of human-reproduction experts announced their plans - current legal
<br>
prohibitions be damned - to bring cloned humans to birth in order to provide
<br>
biological children to infertile couples. They expect to deliver their first
<br>
clone within 18 months. The ripple effect on human history of these and the
<br>
events that will inevitably follow may well make a tsunami seem like a mere
<br>
splash in a playground puddle.
<br>
<p>Human cloning is moving slowly but surely toward reality despite intense and
<br>
widespread opposition throughout the world. Many resisters worry that
<br>
permitting human cloning would remove us from the natural order. As the
<br>
venerable Leon R. Kass has so eloquently put it, cloning brings conception
<br>
and gestation &quot;into the bright light of the laboratory, beneath which the
<br>
child-to-be can be fertilized, nourished, pruned, weeded, watched,
<br>
inspected, prodded, pinched, cajoled, injected, tested, rated, graded,
<br>
approved, stamped, wrapped, sealed, and delivered.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kass's point is that once human life is special-ordered rather than
<br>
conceived, life will never be the same. No longer will each of us be a life
<br>
that is unique from all others who have ever lived. Instead our genetic
<br>
selves will be molded and chiseled in a Petrie dish to comply with the
<br>
social norms of the day. And if something goes wrong, the new life will be
<br>
thrown away like some defective widget or other fungible product. So long,
<br>
diversity. Hello homogeneity.
<br>
<p>Perhaps even worse, widespread acceptance of cloning would be a deathblow to
<br>
the sanctity/equality of life ethic - the cornerstone of Western liberty
<br>
from which sprang our still unrealized dream of universal human rights. The
<br>
premise of the sanctity of life ethic is that each and every one of us is of
<br>
equal, incalculable, moral worth. Whatever our race, sex, ethnicity,
<br>
stature, health, disability, age, beauty, or cognitive capacity, we are all
<br>
full moral equals within the human community - there is no &quot;them,&quot; only
<br>
&quot;us.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cloning stands in stark opposition to this equalitarian dream. It is - and
<br>
always has been - the quintessential eugenic enterprise.
<br>
<p>Eugenics, meaning &quot;good in birth,&quot; directly contradicts the self evident
<br>
truth enunciated by Thomas Jefferson that all people are created equal.
<br>
Eugenicists believe that the moral value of people is relative, or to put it
<br>
another way, that some of us are better than others of us. Eugenicists seek
<br>
to &quot;improve&quot; humanity by breeding out the &quot;undesirable&quot; traits of those
<br>
deemed less worthy. Indeed, the pioneers of the eugenics movement worked for
<br>
more than 50 years during the late 1800s and into the middle of the 20th
<br>
Century to eliminate the genes of the &quot;unfit&quot; from the human gnome, first by
<br>
encouraging proper eugenic marriages (positive eugenics) and more
<br>
perniciously, by involuntarily sterilizing those deemed to have undesirable
<br>
physical and personal traits (negative eugenics).
<br>
<p>Anyone with even a modicum of historical knowledge - alas, a scarce
<br>
commodity in these post-modernistic times - knows where that led. In this
<br>
country alone, 60,000-plus people were involuntary sterilized. In Western
<br>
Europe, eugenics belief systems combusted with social Darwinism and
<br>
anti-Semitism to produce the Nazis and thence to the Holocaust.
<br>
<p>Today's eugenicists are not racist or anti-Semites but they exhibit every
<br>
bit as much hubris as their predecessors by assuming that they - that we -
<br>
have the right to direct the future evolution of humanity, only now rather
<br>
than having to rely on clunky procreative planning they literally grasp the
<br>
human genome in their hands. Cloning plays a big part in these plans as the
<br>
patriarch of the modern bioethics movement, Joseph Fletcher, a wild
<br>
eugenicist, well knew when he wrote nearly 30 years ago that cloning would
<br>
&quot;permit the preservation and perpetuation of the finest genotypes that arise
<br>
in our species.&quot;
<br>
<p>What are these supposedly &quot;finest&quot; genotypes? Most neo-eugenicist cloning
<br>
advocates worship at the altar of the frontal lobe, valuing high
<br>
intelligence and logical thinking in much the same way that founding
<br>
practitioners of eugenics valued the blue eyes and blond hair they saw each
<br>
morning in their own mirrors. Thus, Princeton University's Lee Silver hopes
<br>
through cloning to create a &quot;special group of mental beings&quot; who &quot;will be as
<br>
different from humans as humans are from the primitive worms.that first
<br>
crawled along the earth's surface.&quot; Yet Fletcher, Silver, and most others of
<br>
their ilk almost always miss the point that smart people are not necessarily
<br>
good people. And they rarely discuss designing people with the most
<br>
important human capacities of all: the ability to love unconditionally,
<br>
gentleness, empathy, the deep desire to be helpful and productive.
<br>
Ironically, these highest, best human characteristics are often found in
<br>
people with Down syndrome or other developmental disabilities - the very
<br>
people who the neo eugenicists believe should be evolved intentionally out
<br>
of existence whether through genetic manipulation or if necessary, selective
<br>
abortion, and infanticide.
<br>
<p>Eugenics, as awful as it is, is only the beginning of the threat posed to
<br>
the natural order by human cloning. Some cloners have decided that if they
<br>
are going to &quot;play God&quot;; they might as well do it all the way by creating
<br>
altogether new life forms. Indeed, scientists have already used cloning
<br>
techniques to add jellyfish genetic material to a cloned monkey embryo,
<br>
manufacturing a monkey that glows in the dark. Nor is human life itself
<br>
immune from such &quot;Dr. Meraux&quot; forms of manipulation. For example, some in
<br>
bioethics and bioscience support the creation of chimeras - part human and
<br>
part animal - beings Joseph Fletcher called &quot;parahumans&quot; who he hoped would
<br>
&quot;be fashioned to do dangerous and demeaning jobs.&quot; In other words, Fletcher
<br>
advocated the creation of a slave race of mostly-humans designed by us and
<br>
for our use. &quot;As it is now,&quot; the bioethics patriarch wrote in his typically
<br>
snobbish fashion, &quot;low grade work is shoved off on moronic and retarded
<br>
individuals, the victims of uncontrolled reproduction. Should we not program
<br>
such workers 'thoughtfully' instead of accidentally, by means of
<br>
hybridization?&quot;
<br>
<p>Fletcher's dark dream of human/animal chimeras is well on its way to
<br>
reality. Not too long ago Australian scientists announced they had created a
<br>
&quot;pig-man&quot; through cloning techniques, and allowed the hybrid to develop for
<br>
more than two weeks before destroying it. Last year, a biotech company took
<br>
out a Europe-wide patent on embryos containing cells both from humans and
<br>
from mice, sheep, pigs, cattle, goats, or fish. Where such manipulations
<br>
will lead may be beyond comprehension.
<br>
<p>Cloning presents humankind with the postmodernist version of the Faustian
<br>
bargain. Through cloning, we are told, our greatest dreams can be realized:
<br>
the barren can give birth, genetic anomalies and disabilities can be
<br>
eliminated at the embryonic level, near immortality will be within our grasp
<br>
as replacements, for worn out organs can be grown in the lab for
<br>
transplantation without fear of bodily rejection. But the devil always
<br>
demands his due - the higher the &quot;value&quot; of the bargain, the greater the
<br>
price.
<br>
<p>In cloning technologies we may face the highest price of all: the end of the
<br>
perception of human life as &quot;sacred&quot; and the concomitant increase in the
<br>
nihilistic belief that humans are mere biological life; an increasing
<br>
willingness to use and exploit human life as if it were a mere natural
<br>
resource; eventually, the loss of human diversity itself - and these are
<br>
just the foreseen consequences. The unforeseen consequences of mucking
<br>
around in the human gnome may be worse than we can imagine. As Leon Kass has
<br>
written, &quot;shallow are the souls that have forgotten how to shudder.&quot;
