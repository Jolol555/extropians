</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  I didnt make this clear at all.  I dont mean make a 3D
<br>
brain outta silicon.  I meant a silicon microprocessor running a
<br>
simulation of carbon-based brain cells.  I suppose the first time
<br>
we make a real silicon based sim of a brain, it would run much
<br>
slower than realtime, perhaps one millionth as fast.  It would be
<br>
not much of a conversationalist.  At first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; based intelligence have different diets and different habitats...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Same diet: energy and atoms to build your substrate. Same energy, (mostly)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same atoms. Same habitat: surface of the Earth, at least initially.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Houston, we seem to have a problem.
</em><br>
<p>But also a solution.  We can run AI in geosynchronous orbit
<br>
with restricted downlink.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly: we don't know what will happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will happen if we fail to develop nanotech and/or AI.  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, lowtech scenarios are more easily understandable, and none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them look very pretty nor sustainable.
</em><br>
<p>'Gene we have then two alternatives: one unknown and one
<br>
unabiguously bad.  I choooooose...  the unknown.
<br>
<p>Actually, this whole thread has been tremendously insightful.
<br>
Given the two choices, I personally would choose taking
<br>
my chances with a possibly hostile AI than simply dying the
<br>
old fashioned way.  Yet if I had heirs, I see the point
<br>
of view of the Luddites, who would prefer to relinquish
<br>
technology and hand a low-tech world to their children
<br>
and grandchildren.  I myself see the entire exercise as
<br>
pointless if they too are to grow old and die.  Yet I can
<br>
see where some may logically disagree.  spike
