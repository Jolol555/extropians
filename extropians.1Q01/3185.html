Bear in mind that courts have so far said that it's OK for cops to read
<br>
your address book and the contents of your cellphone speed dial
<br>
directory during an ordinary search (not sure if that's search incident
<br>
to arrest, or the detainment &quot;pat down&quot;--I would hope it's the former,
<br>
since the pat down is supposed to be an officer safety issue. Well, hope
<br>
is too strong a word, but you get what I mean.). 
<br>
<p>I don't know of any specific cases yet regarding PDAs, but the writing's
<br>
on the wall. Encrypt encrypt OK. And have off body backing store.
