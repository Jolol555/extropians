<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A couple of thoughts on what an extropian counterprotest could look like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Numerical inferiority would be so overwhelming in any such situation, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the only feasible alternative would be IMHO a Greenpeace-like stunt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They'd crush us like bugs.  I agree with Sandberg; the most effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; option is writing counterpoint newspaper articles, ideally somewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; influential with a receptive audience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with newspaper articles and such is that they tend to be dry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not very convincing to the public at large.  Very few people remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a moving editorial; only a few more remember a story in a major news 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magazine like Time or Newsweek.
</em><br>
<p>Do you win because a lot of people read an article a single time, or
<br>
because the right people read an article a single time and write their
<br>
own articles based on your memes, multiplying the effect a
<br>
thousandfold? My experience is that it is the later. I write somewhat
<br>
dry articles for a somewhat obscure journal, but I find my views and
<br>
formulations occasionally repeated on editorial pages a week later and
<br>
in the more popular press a month later. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A page needs to be taken from the pro-life/pro-choice playbook:  We need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to rephrase the debate in terms of something for which most people are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favor.  It will NOT help to be anti-environment; not only does that run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter to what many of us really believe, but it will score us no points 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all in he long run with people who will find it easy to revile positions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we hold based on how we're all &quot;pave the earth&quot; types.  
</em><br>
<p>True. However, it is easier to get active against something you are
<br>
against than something you are for, unfortunately. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; A well-organized sloganeering capaign could revolve around &quot;End World Hunger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOW!&quot; - no one is for world hunger, after all.  When one of the more activist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types gets in your face about being pro-genetic engineering and thus anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment, ask them at the top o fyour voice how many acres of virgin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wilderness had to be cleared to grow their &quot;all-natural&quot; cotton and/or hemp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clothes, or grow their organic fruits and vegetables?  How many acres of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal habitat were destroyed so they could feel good about themselves wearing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;all-natural&quot; fibers?  THAT is the sort of sound bite that will make it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the media, and show the ecofundamentalists for what they really are -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a radical fringe group.
</em><br>
<p>Or base your argument on your core premise: genetic engineering will
<br>
help save people's lives - even if it has some risks, the potential
<br>
damage is clearly smaller than the current damage done to the
<br>
environment with unsustainable inefficient agriculture not to mention
<br>
the amount of human suffering the current situation involves and that
<br>
could be avoided. yes, there might be unknown long term effects, but
<br>
do you seriously think they would be worse than a 100 million people
<br>
with vitamin A deficiency?
