<em>&gt; We're seeing at least one example, today, of an entire industry being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven to the brink by improvements in its own efficiency and competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on price. Agriculture!
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't really make sense economically for an entire industry to drive
<br>
its prices so low that no one can make money.  I think the real reason is
<br>
what you mention later:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We've got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most intensive, industrialised agricultural system in the EU, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing with third world banana economies -- it can't bring in enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money to operate effectively. 
</em><br>
<p>So what you are seeing is not that the UK agricultural industry is somehow
<br>
competing itself out of business; it's that it can't compete with the
<br>
low labor and raw material costs of some of the third world countries.
<br>
<p>When this happens, it is usually a signal that it would be better for
<br>
the UK to devote more resources into those industries where it has an
<br>
edge, such as modern, capital-intensive industries which benefit from
<br>
an educated work force.  It can export those products and import food
<br>
and other products that are more efficiently produced elsewhere.
<br>
<p>Granted, the resulting dislocations and unemployment can cause pain to
<br>
the farmers who lose their jobs and livelihoods and may have difficulty
<br>
being trained for other work.  It may be appropriate to use unemployment
<br>
insurance and other policies to cushion the transition.  But in the long
<br>
run, people will benefit if they specialize in things at which they have
<br>
a comparative advantage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we posit a world in which regional economic imbalances have flattened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out, we'll eventually hit a point where downward pressure on food prices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't go any further because if it does there'll be insufficient money to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay for food production -- but consumption os flat. If food is produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at cost, in sufficient quantity and quality for everyone, there is *no*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further room for growth (other than through artificially-induced fashions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fads, which offer transient relief through manufactured scarcity).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens then?
</em><br>
<p>Food prices should stabilize at slightly above costs.
<br>
<p>Hal
