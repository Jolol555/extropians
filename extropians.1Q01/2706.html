<p><em>&gt; Do you really think everyone in jail deserves to be there?
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you aware of the current policy regarding
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No.  What is it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you aware that one can easily rack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up 80+ year sentences with the current set of laws, for crimes with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shown victims?
</em><br>
<p>Can they give life sentences without a body?  I confess ignorance
<br>
of the legal system, but I think you refer to drug penalties.  I think all
<br>
drugs should be legal.
<br>
<p>Actually Im surprised this topic is so controversial.  A coed
<br>
prison colony, regardless of the details, would be preferable
<br>
to the current lot of those who get life without parole, eh?  spike
