Actually, yes I do. Sometimes that's *why* I pour boiling water &quot;down
<br>
the ploog&quot;. Go figure. We are in agreement that if we don't matter to a
<br>
SI, the SI will treat us as if we don't matter. QE freaking D again. 
<br>
<p>I don't exactly disagree with you, BTW; I can imagine a SI that is not
<br>
compassionate. I am not completely sure it is inevitable; there is some
<br>
work on &quot;sanity&quot; that I've heard of that has &quot;satiability&quot; as one of its
<br>
characteristics--if you get enough of what you say you want, you calm
<br>
down and can be generous/beneficient. 
<br>
<p>Bacteria are notoriously insatiable unless they are part of a complex
<br>
ecosystem (a plaque or film)--then they turn out to act commensally.
<br>
There's a lesson here somewhere.
<br>
<p>Just trying to keep the thinking channels open.
