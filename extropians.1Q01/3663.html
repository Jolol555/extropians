<p>You are too kind, Amara, however yours is not an advisable
<br>
way to deal with punsters, for it serves only to encourage
<br>
them to still greater wickedness.  More prudent is a gentle but
<br>
fermi reminder, such as &quot;We do not speak that way on this list.&quot;
<br>
<p>Punsters look for any emotional empact, such as revulsion or
<br>
laughter, and this serves as positive feedback for their ig-
<br>
nobel activities!  Otherwise our humor is soon exhausted as
<br>
posters run the gamowt of word play.  We exclaim: &quot;Yukawa-
<br>
t a pun?  Heres a pun!&quot; which is followed by still greater nonsense,
<br>
or should I say, antisense.  Someone starts it, then its one after a-
<br>
Noether.  Soon the bosons will Bjorken overtime, trying to make
<br>
new physics jokes, or come up with a new spin on old ones.
<br>
Just ask David, its Gross!  Of course they think they are charming,
<br>
but they are in fact strange, and their jokes lack flavor.  All we ask
<br>
is for the extropian physicist-commedians to grant us asymptotic
<br>
freedom from their quarky sense of humor.  spike
