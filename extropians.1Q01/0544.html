<p>If you could leave the brain stem with the body, it might even be able to 
<br>
take care of itself, long as you poured food &amp; water down its throat. 
<br>
Here's a story about a chicken who lived for 18 months without a head, 
<br>
complete with photographs.
<br>
<p>Barbara
<br>
<p>===================================
<br>
<a href="http://home.nycap.rr.com/useless/headless_chicken/mike.html">http://home.nycap.rr.com/useless/headless_chicken/mike.html</a>
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So how was Mike able to survive? Scientists examined him and determined 
<br>
that Mr. Olsen had not done a very good job at chopping Mike's head 
<br>
off.  Most of the head was actually removed, but one ear remained intact. 
<br>
The slice actually missed the jugular vein and a clot prevented him from 
<br>
bleeding to death. Apparently, most of a chicken's reflex actions are 
<br>
located in the brain stem, which was also largely untouched.  Mike was also 
<br>
examined by the officers of several humane societies and was declared to 
<br>
have been free from suffering.
<br>
<p>Through his open esophagus, Mike was fed a mixture of ground up grain and 
<br>
water with your typical eyedropper. Little bits of gravel were dropped down 
<br>
his throat to help his gizzard grind up the food.
<br>
<p>One serious problem that Mike commonly experienced was that he would start 
<br>
to choke on his own mucus.  The Olsens came up with the simple solution of 
<br>
using a syringe to suck the mucus out.  But, one day tragedy struck.  Mike 
<br>
was traveling back home to Fruita and was roosting with the Olsens in their 
<br>
Phoenix motel room.  They heard Mike choking in the middle of the night and 
<br>
quickly realized that they had left the syringe at the sideshow the day 
<br>
before.  Miracle Mike was no more.
<br>
<p>The exact date of Mike's belated departure from this world was never 
<br>
recorded.  Years later, it was estimated, based on Lloyd's information, 
<br>
that Miracle Mike died in March of 1947.  Eighteen months living without a 
<br>
head could be considered a world's record.  Yet, Lloyd didn't want to admit 
<br>
that he had accidentally killed the bird, so he claimed that he had sold 
<br>
the bird off.  This little white lie is the reason that many of the stories 
<br>
printed about Mike claimed that he was still touring the country as late as 
<br>
1949.
