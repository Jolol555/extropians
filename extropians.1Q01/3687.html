<p><em>&gt; I'm not so sure the strangeness of cryonicists is the problem, simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I'll bet most people have never met one, and their exposure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them on TV has been limited.  The numbers of cryonics supporters are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small that their personalities probably haven't had much impact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it's an emotional reaction people have to the very idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics.  Most people find it absurd, horrifying, and/or the ultimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in selfishness and narcissism.  
</em><br>
<p>Oh, yeah. And you gotta love Dr Steve Harris's essay re HP Lovecraft &amp; 
<br>
Cryonics (on the net somewhere), where he explains that HPL was really the 
<br>
first person to think of cryonics, but that HPL came up with the idea in an 
<br>
effort to *create*a*better*horror*story*! (Harris's emphasis).
<br>
<p>And everyone's else's nightmare (waking up in the distant future, cut off 
<br>
from all ties to our present time, etc) is our paradise! But really this goes 
<br>
back to the genesis for most of us cryos/extros, etc.: science fiction.
<br>
<p>In Sci-Fi is where you really get a chance to separate yourself from society; 
<br>
as SF buffs we lived in worlds so different that we got a chance to play with 
<br>
the idea that the &quot;petty&quot; concerns and mores and taboos of any given 
<br>
culture/people/planet are just artifacts of the particular 
<br>
evolutionary/social path taken by those people/culture/aliens, whathaveyou. 
<br>
The idea that some everyday act (e.g., some ordinary act, say, scratching 
<br>
your head), might be fraught with all sorts of social significance or even be 
<br>
taboo in some other culture/planet, is understood by any SF buff; not only 
<br>
understood, but internalized. 
<br>
<p>We understand that nothing is bad, but thinking makes it so, that an innocent 
<br>
head scratching, if it takes place on &quot;Tuieffg, a cold, windswept desert 
<br>
planet better known as Alpha Centauri 4,&quot; may well cause your waitress to 
<br>
break into tears. We understand this.
<br>
<p>So we have *perspective* on the taboos of our own culture. We 
<br>
*are* &quot;strange&quot;. In a sense we live outside the mores of our own culture.
<br>
<p>I don't read science fiction anymore (or any fiction for that matter), but 
<br>
its lessons stay with me, and they separate me from most of society.
<br>
<p>Of course, that really doesn't explain why more SF writers aren't cryos. But 
<br>
maybe they are: I know of at least 2 successful SF writers who are cryos (or 
<br>
practically cryos), and there aren't that many succesful SF writers, so maybe 
<br>
they do have a high % of cryos...
