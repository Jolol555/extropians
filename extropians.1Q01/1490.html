<em>&gt;&gt; This pricing rule sounds stupid, but I want to defend it, or at least

<em>&gt;&gt; explain why it is not as absurd as it sounds.
</em><br>
<p>I actually know a bit about auctions, so I'm willing to go into 
<br>
more depth on this issue.  (For those without the relevant background, 
<br>
there's a good intro at <a href="http://www.agorics.com/new.html">http://www.agorics.com/new.html</a>.  It doesn't
<br>
cover commodity auctions in any detail, but it does compare first and
<br>
second price auctions, and the effects of open- versus sealed bid from 
<br>
the perspective of how they effect anyone's incentive to game the
<br>
system.)  
<br>
<p>I'll start by agreeing that first price auctions aren't unreasonable
<br>
in general.  I strongly question whether the variation used in this
<br>
market is appropriate.  
<br>
<p>I want to clear up some terminology first. I don't think it's
<br>
appropriate to refer to this as a &quot;first price&quot; auction.  You said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; the highest-price rule (also called first-price auction rules).
</em><br>
<p>As I understand what I've read, there is a continuing auction for
<br>
power throughout the day, which can be treated as a series of
<br>
auctions.  If they were first price auctions, then each of the
<br>
auctions throughout the day would be settled at the highest price
<br>
bid.  (Second price auctions settle at the price bid by the second
<br>
highest bidder, which reduces the incentives for buyers to exagerate
<br>
their desire for the commodity.)  
<br>
<p>In the California power market, (as I understand it) there are a
<br>
series of auctions throughout the day, each one awarding power to the
<br>
highest bidder.  At the end of the day, the highest clearing price for
<br>
any of the day's auctions is charged to all the winning bidders.  In
<br>
this institution, it's possible for the price someone pays to be
<br>
controlled by auctions in which they didn't participate at all!
<br>
<p>Reactions to some of your other points:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; it is entirely common in commodity markets to pay the same price
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for all supplies of the commodity. 
</em><br>
<p>I didn't know this, but it makes sense when the commodities are
<br>
non-perishable.  This is decidedly not the case for electricity.
<br>
There are limits on how much power any producer can produce at any
<br>
point in time, and (in general) you can't make it early in the day and 
<br>
save it for later.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; If we accept this general principle, then in the case of the electricity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; market there remain two questions.  First, is it reasonable to use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; same price for all the electricity delivered during the day, given that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; supply and demand fluctuate during the day?  And second, if we are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to do this, should we use the highest-price rule (also called first-price
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; auction rules).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think the justification for using the same price all day is twofold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; First, given how the market works, demand is almost completely insensitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to price.  Inter-day price variations aren't passed on to customers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; so they do not adjust their demand in response.  Therefore there is less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; advantage than in some markets to adjusting the price on an hour by hour
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; basis since it will not affect demand.
</em><br>
<p>The problem has to do with charging a price to all users throughout
<br>
the day that depends on the day's greatest congestion, when much of
<br>
the use can't be time-shifted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Secondly, this might actually reduce some of the opportunities for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;gaming&quot; the system (using strategies to achieve higher than competitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rates).  If they actually got their hour-by-hour prices, companies which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; knew that electricity was going to be worth more in the afternoon than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the morning would hold their electricity off the market until then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If you were selling a product that would be worth three times more at 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; PM than at 10 AM, wouldn't you do the same?  By giving the sellers the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; same price all day it eliminates this kind of manipulation.
</em><br>
<p>This particular argument doesn't work since so little of the supply
<br>
can be time-shifted.  I don't think this set of rules reduces the
<br>
opportunities for gaming.  The institution has the wrong incentives
<br>
even if no one is trying to exploit the rules.  This design ensures
<br>
that the sellers get a &quot;windfall&quot; price as long as there is at least
<br>
one time during the day when (price-insensitive) demand approaches or
<br>
exceeds supply (which is unable to expand in response to price.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Now we come to the question of first-price auctioning, that is, using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the highest price rather than the average price or some other rule.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The justification for first-price auctions is, again, that it tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reduce some forms of gaming and manipulation.  Without this kind of rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; companies have to second-guess what other suppliers are going to ask.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; They want to set their price as high as possible, but not substantially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; higher than everyone else.  This involves guessing and invites collusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; With a simple auction rule like first-price auctioning there is less of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this kind of gamesmanship.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this is precisely backward.  First price auctions encourage
<br>
participants to manipulate the amount of their bids since their bids
<br>
affect the price they  pay.  Second price rules mean that the price
<br>
one participant bids only affects whether or not they get some of the
<br>
commodity; the price is set by the bids of the other participants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Besides, if we changed the rules it would not necessarily save money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The prices we are paying ultimately are due to the fact that demand is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; coming up against the limits of supply.  Changes to the market rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; won't change this fundamental fact.
</em><br>
<p>It's certainly true that supply is limited and that's a primary cause
<br>
of the problem.  Another possible solution is to allow the utilities
<br>
to make long-term contracts.  (Davis wants to negotiate the contracts
<br>
himself, which is not at all the same thing.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Imagine that eBay, the online auctioner, adopted a rule to &quot;save money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to buyers&quot;.  Whatever price an auction closed at, the buyer only had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pay HALF that price to the seller.  So if an item sold for $100, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; buyer would only have to pay $50.  It should be clear that this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not actually save any significant amount to buyers.  Items would simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sell for twice what they do now, so that the actual amount paid would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the same.  The real prices are set by supply and demand and the auction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rules have a relatively minor effect.
</em><br>
<p>Your description of your example is reasonable.  The analogy doesn't
<br>
apply, unless I've misunderstood the way the California power auctions 
<br>
are run.
