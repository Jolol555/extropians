<em>&gt; &quot;Why we must kill God&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Kill the God of Spinoza?
<br>
Kill Venus - Aphrodite?
<br>
Very difficult tasks.
<br>
Replacing Gods with Chaitin's numbers?
<br>
Delete also the Omega-deity of Teilhard?
<br>
Aristotle already pointed out very
<br>
interesting things about these issues.
<br>
- scerir
<br>
<p>Further, where a series has a completion (telos),
<br>
all the preceding steps are for the sake of that.
<br>
Now surely as in intelligent action, so in nature;
<br>
and as in nature, so it is in each action,
<br>
if nothing interferes. Now intelligent action is
<br>
for the sake of an end; therefore the nature of things
<br>
also is so. Thus if a house, e.g. had been a thing
<br>
made by nature, it would have been made in the same way
<br>
as it is now by art (techne); and if things made by nature
<br>
were made also by art, they would come to be in the same
<br>
way as by nature. Each step then in the series is for
<br>
the sake of the next; and generally art partly completes
<br>
what nature cannot bring to a finish, and partly imitates
<br>
her. If, therefore, artificial products are for the sake
<br>
of an end, so clearly also are natural products.
<br>
The relation of the later to the earlier terms of
<br>
the series is the same in both.
<br>
- Aristotle, Phys. II, 8
<br>
<p>And the science which knows to what end each
<br>
thing must be done is the most authoritative
<br>
of the sciences, and more authoritative than
<br>
any ancillary science; and this end is the good
<br>
of that thing, and in general the supreme good
<br>
in the whole of nature. Judged by all the tests
<br>
we have mentioned, then, the name in question falls
<br>
to the same science; this must be a science that
<br>
investigates the first principles and causes;
<br>
for the good, i.e. the end, is one of the causes.
<br>
- Aristotle, Metaph. 1, 2.
