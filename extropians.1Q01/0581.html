<em>&gt; Dont lose sleep over it Eliezer.  Ive posted several math errors

</em><br>
<p>Arithmetic errors happen, especially when fingers slip on keyboards.
<br>
In this case Eliezer multipled by 2,600 seconds / hour instead of
<br>
3,600.  How did I know?
<br>
<p>The trick to tracing back errors when you suspect the actual operation
<br>
was carried out correctly (it gets more complicated if you think a
<br>
step in the algorithm might have been done wrong) is to figure out the
<br>
different ways of representing the constants and compare the values
<br>
that would give you the correct answer to possible values that would
<br>
give you the incorrect answer.  Then you look see if any of them seem
<br>
to be off in any significant way, e.g. off by one, or approximately
<br>
one, or off by one position on a standard keyboard.
<br>
<p>So we could start by saying that the way to get the answer is:
<br>
<p>9.8 * 3600 * 24
<br>
or
<br>
9.8 * 60 * 60 * 24
<br>
<p>... and in either case divide by 1,000 to get kilometers / second /
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>Now, the approximately correct answer is 847, and the clearly wrong
<br>
one is 611.  The ratio of the incorrect answer to the correct one is
<br>
approx. .7213 Then just try multiplying .7213 by all the relevant
<br>
constants:
<br>
<p>For 9.8 you get 7.0687 - nope.  For 60 you get 43.278 - nope.  For 24
<br>
you get 17.3112 - nope.  But for 3600 you get 2596.68 -- now hang on
<br>
that almost an off-by-one error on the most significant digit!
<br>
<p>Now let's try doing the calculation with 2600 * 9.8 * 24 -&gt; 611520
<br>
meters per second per day, which equals 611.52 km per second per day.
<br>
If Eliezer was using a truncating caculating program, (bc or dc on
<br>
Unix maybe?) this would yield 611.
<br>
<p>Thus we see the wisdom of one of the few truly generally useful
<br>
lessons from elementary school -- do your arithmetic over until the
<br>
majority of times you've done it you got the same answer, aka check
<br>
your work!  :-)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
James
