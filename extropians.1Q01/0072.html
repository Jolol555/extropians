Clothes that do the thinking
<br>
<p>By Julian Siddle of BBC Science
<br>
<p>Scientists in Belgium are working on what they think
<br>
will be the definitive clothes of the future.
<br>
<p>The clothes, known as &quot;i-Wear&quot; for Intelligent Wear,
<br>
will perform many of the current functions of
<br>
mobile phones, computers and even hospital monitoring
<br>
equipment.
<br>
<p>Starlab, a research institute based in Brussels and
<br>
specialising in the field of artificial
<br>
intelligence, is trying to make clothes that seem to
<br>
think.
<br>
<p>The company says the range of tasks that the clothes
<br>
will be able to perform is vast, from taking phone
<br>
calls to keeping a check on the health of the wearer.
<br>
<p>Environmental sensors
<br>
<p>&quot;The layer which is closest to your body will be the
<br>
layer that is monitoring your body functions such
<br>
as heartbeat, blood pressure, temperature,&quot; says
<br>
Katrien van Gerven.
<br>
<p>&quot;Other layers include sensors, and these sensors can
<br>
measure what is happening in the environment. They
<br>
can measure the light so they know when it's dark. They
<br>
can also measure sounds to determine whether
<br>
you're in a loud environment.
<br>
<p>&quot;These kinds of data can be processed through other
<br>
technology that is in your clothing, like mobiles
<br>
for instance. So, if you are in a very loud
<br>
environment, this will mean that your mobile should
<br>
ring
<br>
louder and if you're in a meeting, the mobile shouldn't
<br>
ring at all,&quot; she says.
<br>
<p>Commercial production of such clothes is some way off,
<br>
but a shirt with a simple memory function has
<br>
already been developed.
<br>
<p>Memory shirt
<br>
<p>This smart garment could help you remember your keys or
<br>
wallet. Microchips in the shirt are linked to
<br>
other microchips in objects such as wallets and keys,
<br>
so the shirt will know whether or not a key is in
<br>
its pocket and can warn the wearer if the key is
<br>
missing.
<br>
<p>In the far future, the company predict they will be
<br>
developing clothes with the ability to assess the
<br>
wearer's mood. Clothes could even remember where you've
<br>
been on holiday, creating a snapshot of
<br>
atmosphere, sounds and even smells.
<br>
<p>But fashion has not been a major consideration in the
<br>
design of the prototype clothes, it seems. The
<br>
thinking shirt, although finished in a nice check
<br>
pattern, has a small antenna protruding from one
<br>
shoulder.
<br>
<p>Perhaps i-Wear will not be appearing on the catwalks
<br>
just yet.
<br>
<p>Aumentar!
<br>
Onward,
<br>
