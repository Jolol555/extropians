Yes; precisely. My read on, for instance, Drexler's
<br>
active shield concept is that we hand over
<br>
peacekeeping tasks to an AI which is equipped with
<br>
weapons superior to all others. The moment that
<br>
happens--no more checks or balances. If ti decides for
<br>
reasons we are unable even to fathom that we're toast,
<br>
we're toast.

<em>&gt; &gt;Marlow's Paradox:

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;“We cannot entrust our fate to machines without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;emotions, for they have no compassion; we cannot

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Basically, we can't trust machines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And what's different about people?  We have checks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and balances in goverment, contracts and arbiters in
</em><br>
