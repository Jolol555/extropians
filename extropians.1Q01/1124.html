<p><em>    &gt; Anyone else getting tired of his waste of bandwidth?
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; What's so hard about truncating the responses so we don't receive 12K for a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; 1K flame?  Even if we killfile him, we have to download this dreck.
</em><br>
<p>I guess he's still doing it, I stopped reading Joe Dees a long time ago
<br>
because of it, if I don't see original material on the first screen I refuse
<br>
to scroll, I just delete. I've given up trying to figure out why people feel
<br>
the urge to quote EVERYTHING, I've given up trying to figure out why
<br>
people repeate an entire 12 K post with the only original comment being
<br>
&quot;this long 12K off topic post (see above) waste of bandwidth and should
<br>
not have been sent.&quot;
