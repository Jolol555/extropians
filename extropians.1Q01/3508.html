I'm with you on this, Harvey. I've been &quot;hanging around&quot; this list on and off
<br>
(mostly off) for the past few years, and every time I get back on I find myself
<br>
disappointed by the amount of jingoistic rhetoric, insulting put-downs, and
<br>
non-extropian thinking. (This isn't unique to this listserve, alas.) Perhaps
<br>
I'm misreading the extropian principles, but I thought we were suppose to be
<br>
forward thinking. To me this means working toward a better future, not
<br>
wallowing in outmoded memes.
<br>
<p>I first came across many of the ideas promoted by extropianism back in the late
<br>
'70s through reading the works of F.M. Esfandiary  and others (this is
<br>
pre-nanotech, of course), and was initally excited when I discovered Extropy
<br>
magazine, the website, and this list. Wow, I thought, here are some people who
<br>
are putting these ideas into action, who are willing to publically express the
<br>
idea (so uncool in our present age of cynicism) that we can have a better
<br>
future. For the most part, this dovetailed nicely with my owning thinking.
<br>
<p>I've always thought that we can have the kind of future we want if we
<br>
concentrate simultaneously on technological/scientific progress AND
<br>
self-improvement/social progress. To me this involves throwing off old baggage
<br>
and looking forward, and this includes not only not demonizing &quot;the enemy,&quot; but
<br>
not even thinking of people with different views AS the enemy. After all, isn't
<br>
fighting kind of primitive? Negotiation through finding a common ground (such
<br>
as the fact that pretty much everyone except for outright nuts and fanatics
<br>
wants a better future for themselves and their friends/families) seems like a
<br>
more evolved approach than conflict and name-calling. But, hey, maybe I'm
<br>
naive.
<br>
<p>Just my 2 cents.
