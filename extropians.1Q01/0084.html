<p>There are difficulties, it's true. For instance, you are contrained by a
<br>
child's vocabulary - not a huge problem in our case, but probably tricky in
<br>
general. More interestingly, you are constrained by a kid's concept of
<br>
number and conservation laws; kid's have a lot of trouble understanding big
<br>
numbers (100 may as well be infinity), so talking about something
<br>
infinitesimally small is quite difficult; bridging the conceptual gap
<br>
between the macro and micro scale is very difficult, and if you can't do
<br>
that, the whole lot of the subject matter seems like a weird fairytale.
<br>
After all, if there are all these bacteria everywhere, where are they? I
<br>
can't see them...
<br>
<p>Still, you can struggle by. There seems to be an emphasis throughout
<br>
education that you have to walk before you can run. That means starting at
<br>
the most basic concepts, and building up. Like ensuring a solid
<br>
understanding of big numbers, before trying to apply the concepts (like
<br>
talking about very very small things).
<br>
<p>I take issue with that approach, however. It leads to this very theoretical
<br>
learning, which goes on for a long time. The ability to actually apply what
<br>
you have learned gets pushed back to later years of schooling, even to uni
<br>
(even beyond that); meanwhile, stuff you learn at school is strange,
<br>
intangible gobledegook, which bears no relation to the rest of your life.
<br>
This leads to lack of retention and lack of interest. How many times have we
<br>
all heard people complain about Maths in school? That it never did them any
<br>
good, that they never used it again and can't remember it any more?
<br>
<p>I feel that I was lucky early on to get a computer, and get into
<br>
programming, because I found a solid application for a lot of the maths I
<br>
was taught. It helped it feel more real for me, which kept my interest
<br>
piqued.
<br>
<p>You see people go back to schooling in their later life and see it in an
<br>
entirely different way; they understand that they can get some tangible
<br>
benefit from the stuff they are learning. Interestingly, they tend to do
<br>
very well!
<br>
<p>I'm not against theory; if anything, I go overboard with it. But I think,
<br>
when you're talking about kids, you are talking about little people who are
<br>
trying really hard to come to grips with an astoundingly complex world. They
<br>
want real information to help them work with and in it. Abstract theory
<br>
means little to them; they want to know why stuff falls down, or what germs
<br>
are, or why they can't fly up into the sky. So I start with the specifics,
<br>
and fill back in toward the more general &amp; abstract as necessary.
