<em>&gt; Why? The learning system needs to learn about its &quot;environment&quot; (in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; making deductions doesn't seem to be an efficient way of doing this,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; program cannot increase its algorithmic complexity just by extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself with code it writes. So what is left is empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimentation with code (guided by deductions from already learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff). The system needs to learn from its environment about many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, including what kind of statistical environment it is - if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a smooth fitness landscape code optimization is best done by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hill-climbing or something similar, while on a rugged but regular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landscape other algorithms are needed.
</em><br>
<p>Is there a good reason you left out induction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about the space of code relevant for AI? Most likely it is nicer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the general case, so there are some seed programs that are on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average better than others. But we should remember that this space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still contains Gödel-undecidable stuff, so it is by no means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple. The issue here is whether even the most optimal seed program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converges towards a optimum fast enough to be interesting. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicate things, programs can increase the dimensionality of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search space by becoming more complex, possibly enabling higher values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of V(P) but also making the search problem exponentially harder. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a kind of limit here, where systems can quickly improve their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value in the first steps, but then rapidly get a search space that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting more and more unmanageable. I guess the &quot;intelligence&quot; of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a system would behave like the logarithm of time or worse - definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not exponential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&lt;the following is sloppy but may be worth some thought&gt;
<br>
<p>Godel undeciability is probably not terribly relevant given an ability
<br>
to make inductive leaps and tests them and enough loosness in the system
<br>
to allow workable solutions to be discovered and deployed that are not
<br>
fully mathematically rigourous. 
<br>
<p>If the searching mechanisms are capable of expanding the paralleism of
<br>
the searching and of combining together branches in ways difficult to
<br>
express mathematically (rather slooppy like within the brain) I think
<br>
the above arguments are unnecessarily restrictive.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I would recommend Christoph Adami's _Introduction to Artificial Life_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sprinmger, New York 1998 for a discussion of environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information gathering in evolving programs (based on his papers on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this; see <a href="http://www.krl.caltech.edu/~adami/cas.html">http://www.krl.caltech.edu/~adami/cas.html</a>).
</em><br>
<p>I would not say it is what you have shown.  It is what you have argued. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It should be noted that the choice of values is not just important,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but likely the most complex problem! There seems to be some general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule (a bit of experience-based handwaving here) that if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reformulate an optimisation problem so that the solution algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes very simple (like a GA or neural network) then a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts has to be spent on setting parameters like the fitness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function or network parameters; the total effort of writing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm, setting parameters and running it appears to be roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constant (it would be interesting to see if this can be proven). So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI value function can likely be as complex as the finished program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself if the seed program is simple! I think this is because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above kind of systems doesn't interact much with any external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment feeding them extra information, all the algorithmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity has to come &quot;from inside&quot;.  In real life, the harsh fitness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function of a complex reality already holds a tremendous amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Built-in forcing functions that will force conclusions to be made
<br>
and tried regardless of mathematical completeness.  This is a good
<br>
point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To sum up, I doubt Colossus, even given its cameras and missiles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have been able to bootstrap itself very fast. It seems it had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been given a very simple value function, and that would likely lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very slow evolution. To get a real AI bootstrap we probably need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connect it a lot with reality, and reality is unfortunately rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow even when it is Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Another possibility is an ALife micro-world operating at higher speed
<br>
but with less driving complexity.
