<p><em>&gt; I believe that it would be highly useful for situations like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this to come under the focus of a national or international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rapid&quot; response team.  One can only imagine the consternation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of local school board officials, principals, teachers, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the start receiving telephone calls from various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians (in the U.S., Europe, etc.) asking them what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could possibly have been thinking to &quot;censure&quot; a scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study.)
</em><br>
<p>Interesting idea. 
<br>
<p>Having a lot of people call up someone or protest against something
<br>
usually amounts to little, at least on a larger political level (&quot;Oh
<br>
well, another interest group. Yawn.&quot;). This approach is more clever,
<br>
because it makes the local administrator realise that he is watched by
<br>
the world. It might be more effective in cases like the one you
<br>
mentioned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What would be the &quot;logistics&quot; of a rapid response team?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) to identify cases that a majority of extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     would have an interest in expressing an opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) to make available the contact information (email/phone)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of the individuals involved in the issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (c) to report to the group/sub-group regarding any conversations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     or responses by the parties inolved in the issue.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds doable. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, I offer this example and a suggested response strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a means for dealing with &quot;political action&quot; on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian front lines.
</em><br>
<p>Also note that writing articles and news stories about events like
<br>
this can be an excellent way of spreading your agenda. I recently
<br>
wrote a small humorous essay about how the local muncipality had
<br>
&quot;improved&quot; the local park by adding fences everywhere that actually
<br>
was an essay conveying just why centrally planned projects often are
<br>
counterproductive and inefficient - a political statement that would
<br>
otherwise have been rather dry to read. A girl with a censored science
<br>
project can easily become a good symbol of the need for free speech,
<br>
free research and a less anxiously PC society.
