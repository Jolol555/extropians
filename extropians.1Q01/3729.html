In his prelude to Amara's Plasma Physics Lession, Spike Jones wrote:

<p>Because the Extropian archive layout recycles on itself and
<br>
the entire archive isn't indexed due to some program bugs,
<br>
the only way to access the really old MBrain threads to
<br>
go through the '99 and early '00 archives by hand.
<br>
(Spike, you should test things before you recomend them....)
<br>
For people who enjoy that idea as much as they do eating bread
<br>
that has fallen butter side down, you can access the expanding
<br>
list of papers at:

<br>
<p>For the record, I would like to note that *most* of
<br>
the discussion around plasma physics was due to my noticing a
<br>
Science News article in mid-January regarding the fact that
<br>
Corona Mass Ejections contain a billion tons of highly charged plasma.
<br>
I was discussing it with Spike because I thought it would be highly
<br>
useful for him to apply his engineering talent and creative mind to
<br>
the problem of how to use that much heated plasma to solve the electricity
<br>
shortage in California, so I wouldn't have to keep paying
<br>
(indirectly, due to Seattle's higher energy prices) for his
<br>
prime number searches (something I view as only *slightly*
<br>
less wasteful than SETI@HOME...).  [I am under the impression that
<br>
the deregulation process in California State put a cap on energy
<br>
prices there (presumably saving Spike from the consequences of the
<br>
state's problem).  There is no such cap however in Washington and
<br>
my electricity rates are in the process of going up 30%.]
<br>
I find it very interesting, that the Californians have a
<br>
very nasty habit of exporting their problems to Washington
<br>
(First it was traffic, now its energy shortages. I wonder
<br>
what it will be next?).
<br>
<p>I'm a fairly firm believer in the principle that if you dig
<br>
your grave you shouldn't throw others into it first so you
<br>
can lie on something soft when you have to get in yourself!
<br>
<p>Spike is working off and on some related M-Brain stuff but it
<br>
doesn't have as much to do with plasma physics as it does
<br>
with finding the most efficient way to shift the orbital
<br>
plane of the solar collectors as you do planetary dismantlement.
<br>
[He keeps promising me hard numbers on this, but keeps getting
<br>
distracted with looking for prime numbers...]
<br>
<p>The M-Brain related question that I've sent to Amara related
<br>
to the Freese &amp; Graff paper regarding the limits that Multi-TEV
<br>
gamma rays place on the abundance of old (cool) white dwarfs.
<br>
This seems based on the fact that near-to-mid-IR radiation attenuates
<br>
the gamma rays by some mysterious process.  This interaction might be used
<br>
to set temperature constraints (and/or abundance constraints) on
<br>
M-Brains if I understood the physics involved.
<br>
[I believe Amara is still researching this point as it seems to
<br>
involve some subtle properties of electromagnetic radiation.]
