<p>&quot;One&quot; what? This seems a bit inflammatory, especially since you really don't know me.
<br>
Are you trying to be funny?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;Human nature&quot; being the evolved behavioral psychology of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal. Do you dispute?
</em><br>
<p>Of course I don't dispute this in general terms. I was responding (somewhat
<br>
flippantly, I will admit) to what I perceived to be a tired and over-used blanket
<br>
application of the term, as if it means only one universally agreed upon thing rather
<br>
than a continuum of things. I see it used this way all the time by people who are
<br>
simply trying to rationalize or excuse specific behaviors, and by defeatists who have
<br>
given up on the idea that we can change and/or improve ourselves. If you meant it in
<br>
a more specific way, an elaboration would have been useful. If I read more into it
<br>
than was there, I certainly apologize for misinterpreting you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Communism is only non-despotic in its perfect state. Perfection is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstable state, which is a truism of all natural systems. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible to attain equilibria in a perfect state due to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instability, thus communism will always be despotic, and given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature of power to corrupt and attract the corruptible, communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies will always result in tyranny. Ant colonies may be cute, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are heinously despotic and irrespective of the individual. Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because communist despotism (i.e. imperfect) works for ants doesn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it works for humans.
</em><br>
<p>I have no argument with this either, again in general terms. Did I sound like I was
<br>
defending communism? Ouch. My personal political philosophy is nowhere near it,
<br>
believe me. I was simply trying to make a point, which I obviously failed to do. I
<br>
was irritated by what I again saw as a tired tactic, that of labeling other people as
<br>
communists simply to somehow demonize them or put them down. I think this is a
<br>
counter-productive strategy and can weaken one's credibility.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Libertarianism has no perfect state, that is its nature. It is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attaining an equilibrium between individuals that is flexible based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the abilities, wants, and needs of each individual.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. We'll have to part ways on this one. While I would personally prefer a
<br>
libertarian system over a communist one, I think it too can be used by corrupt
<br>
individuals to oppress or exploit others (which is what has always, historically,
<br>
been the case with communism). Not to pose a conundrum, but isn't the idea that
<br>
libertarianism has no perfect state itself a perfect state? I have always felt that
<br>
the libertarian ideal is just that, an ideal, although one that certainly allows more
<br>
tolerance of others than most. Perhaps I just think about things differently.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You don't get a stable functioning society by making everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give up their entire days work to the collective, because it IS human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature for an individual to believe they produced more than they did and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve more than they do, and to expect additional reward for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional or better work.
</em><br>
<p>Again I feel like you are using the term &quot;human nature&quot; as if it means only one
<br>
thing. Have you personally interviewed everyone on the planet to see if they agree
<br>
with you? Of course not. People who are raised in a capitalist or market driven
<br>
society are going to feel this way (I certainly do), but that does not mean it is the
<br>
only way to look at things. It is ultimately a personal or cultural preference, not a
<br>
given, no matter how much we detest it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It is human nature for a person to put more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance in the safety, security, freedom and happiness of themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and loved ones versus anybody else.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you on this one because it can be traced to our biology. This applies to
<br>
most animals in varying degrees.
<br>
<p>Thanks for a lively discourse!
<br>
