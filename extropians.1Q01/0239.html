<em>&gt; I'm finally signing up with Alcor. (I'm just beginning the process)
</em><br>
<p>Excellent!  I just completed my sign-up a few months ago, and I've
<br>
been wearing either my necklace or bracelet, (as an ankle bracelet)
<br>
ever since.  (BTW, anyone have any suggests on resizing the thing
<br>
to be a bit larger?)
<br>
<p>The most important thing I can suggest to you, and anyone else
<br>
reading this who may be considering signing up, is to go through
<br>
the paperwork and start/continue things today.  Do not let yourself
<br>
procrastinate; this is something that's very easy to put off even
<br>
if you fully intend to get around to it.
<br>
<p>(This is somewhat morbid, but I have come to have the opinion
<br>
that if someone has concluded that cryonics makes sense, that
<br>
it's possibly/probably viable, and that it has a positive
<br>
risk/reward ratio in their judgment, that for them to plan to
<br>
sign up but yet procrastinate on actually doing so is vaguely
<br>
suicidal--it's not quite telling people not to attempt to perform
<br>
a possibly life-saving medical procedure on you if you suddenly
<br>
need it done, but it's almost that.  I relay this line of
<br>
reasoning here not really to pass negative judgment on
<br>
people--deciding to sign up for cryonics is something that takes
<br>
some thinking, but to let people know the line of thinking I used
<br>
in order to overcome my own ambivalence and procrastination in
<br>
this matter.  I had requested the paperwork years ago, but I did
<br>
not start the full sign-up procedure until spring of last year,
<br>
and even then not until after I had thought through things in
<br>
this way.)
<br>
<p>Having gone through the paperwork and being fully signed up does
<br>
make me feel more in control of my life.  I exercise regularly,
<br>
eat healthily, and take vitamins, and that puts me more in
<br>
control of my health as far as those things go than I would
<br>
otherwise be.  Now I can also say that if I were in a car
<br>
accident and declared brain-dead, that I have explicitly
<br>
rejected the default decision to simply give up the fight and lay
<br>
there and die.  There may be many reasons why cryonics might not
<br>
save my life at such a point, but at least I can say I have
<br>
actively influenced things to make it more likely that I would
<br>
continue to live.  (As an aside, a few days ago there was a life
<br>
extension foundation update, (www.lef.org, not Alcor), about how
<br>
having taken creatine can lower the extent of brain trauma.)
<br>
<p>And veering further off-topic in general but staying within the
<br>
how-to-improve-your-chances-at-continuing-healthy-living topic
<br>
for a moment:
<br>
<p>My local gym has complete-blood-count blood tests every 6-8
<br>
months or so, which I have done just as a bit of a physical
<br>
sanity check, as it's good to know your levels of things.  (Also,
<br>
I found out that if you break down and go to McDonald's the day
<br>
before the test, that the results are quite visible!)  I have not
<br>
yet ordered the ~750 www.lef.org larger tests that check more
<br>
things; for now I'm satisfied with this.
<br>
<p>However, my gym recently had some other folks over, who can check
<br>
for, among other things, abdominal aortic aneurysms.  It's the sort
<br>
of thing that if you have one, you can find out via a test like this
<br>
and have the problem corrected by surgery, or you could find out by
<br>
simply falling over dead one day, or you could simply never have a
<br>
problem.  The folks they went through are at
<br>
<a href="http://www.lifelinescreening.com/">http://www.lifelinescreening.com/</a>
<br>
<p>They do a few other tests too, and although I don't have any
<br>
plans to do this test again, (in my understanding I needn't worry
<br>
about developing an abdominal aortic aneurysms after having been
<br>
tested for it once), I have to admit to enjoying having gone
<br>
because I got to see my aorta on ultrasound more than having
<br>
enjoying having ruled out that condition.
<br>
<p>It was kind of neat to see yourself from the inside!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a list of insurance companies on their website, I was wondering if out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these listed, anyone has any recommendations:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; *Rudi Hoffman, (Alcor Member)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certified Financial Planner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Investments and Financial Services
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I saw that Rudi and Mary (it says she has more insurance policies for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crytransport funding than any other insurance agent) are both mentioned in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the back of Cryonics (4th Qrt, 2000)
</em><br>
<p>Rudi Hoffman did my insurance, and I am quite pleased with how things
<br>
have gone.  He seems most professional and helpful, as well as being
<br>
an interesting person.
<br>
<p>I now have a $150k GUL policy through Western Reserve, enough for
<br>
neuro with a lot of cushion for both cost increases and for most any
<br>
unexpectedly high transport expenses, expenses that I (my estate?)
<br>
might incur if I were to die in such a way as to present a difficult
<br>
or expensive transport problem but still have enough potentially
<br>
viable brain tissue left.  (Flame-free plane crash while over Greenland?)
<br>
<p>And while it's also enough to go to the newer whole-body
<br>
vitrification method but with much less cushion remaining, I am
<br>
planning on staying with the neuro choice for now.  Were I to
<br>
switch to the whole-body choice, I would probably want to up the
<br>
amount some.
<br>
<p>(I'm mentioning all this to spur possible discussion of amounts,
<br>
even though such information may be too personal for many to want
<br>
to discuss freely.  As an aside, I went to Rudi with the $150k
<br>
figure in mind, giving him my reasoning for it along with my
<br>
personal goals/values/priorities that I based my reasoning on.  I
<br>
was impressed with his response; basically while he validated my
<br>
reasoning based on my own priorities, discussing things from that
<br>
point of view and filling me in on general implementation details
<br>
of which I was not aware, he was quite professionally hesitant
<br>
when I inquired about the wisdom of purchasing a greater amount
<br>
instead, as doing so would not be in line with the personal
<br>
priorities that I had conveyed to him.  As it is, I will only
<br>
increase the amount were I to come to believe that I would likely
<br>
decide to switch to whole-body vitrification in the future, or
<br>
were my priorities and goals to otherwise change somehow.)
<br>
<p>In any event, Rudi has talked with and has written documentation
<br>
from the folks at Western Reserve, saying that they do accept
<br>
life insurance policies for the purpose of funding cryonics.  He
<br>
also regularly keeps in touch with Alcor and its membership
<br>
director.
<br>
<p>I had told both that it was okay to relay information about me to
<br>
the other; I found it pleasant that during the sign-up process
<br>
that each of them was also familiar with my current state of
<br>
progress through the other's various procedures.
<br>
<p>I am very happy to have gone through this with a life insurance
<br>
agent who is familiar with cryonics issues.  I had previously
<br>
experienced the horror of trying to talk with companies and
<br>
random agents where were not familiar with such issues, although
<br>
even the general state of the industry left a bad taste in my
<br>
mouth.
<br>
<p>As to my before-Rudi experiences:
<br>
<p>Before researching things, it didn't occur to me that there would
<br>
be *any* larger life insurance company that didn't have
<br>
downloadable sample policies and detailed information on costs
<br>
and benefits, with tables and formulas on how they classified and
<br>
treated people in different rate groups.  I had in mind building
<br>
a large spreadsheet of a bunch of information about different
<br>
companies, and finding which ones met my needs best.
<br>
<p>As it happens, none of these companies would tell me anything in
<br>
detail about their policies without literally requiring blood!  I
<br>
had no problem with people representing a couple dozen companies
<br>
coming over and drawing my blood over a period of weeks, and none
<br>
of them seemed to have a problem with this ridiculous overhead
<br>
they had set up for themselves in order to simply send out a
<br>
detailed brochure either.  In my mind, if they wanted to throw
<br>
away money like that, I was quite happy to let them.  (In my mind
<br>
I amused myself with the thought of later holding my nose and
<br>
relaying a complaint to my state's Insurance Commissioner about
<br>
these companies' vampiric blood-for-brochure requirements.)
<br>
<p>After the first company I talked with, (Zurich Kemper), I found
<br>
out a few things:
<br>
<p>1.  Given that I was already talking with one insurance company
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was interested in getting a policy to fit my needs,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;general agents would refuse to talk with me, as they would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think I was not serious about purchasing a policy, or that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not deal with them in order to get a 10 cent/year
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better policy elsewhere.
<br>
<p>2.  The companies I talked with require an actual application
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from you before giving detailed information about their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies.  However, if you apply to multiple companies,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and even if you tell them on the application that you're
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applying to multiple companies in order to find the best
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deal for some specified amount of insurance, the existence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the other applications will be a red flag on your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application with them that can cause them to turn you down
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and *still* not tell you about the insurance they supposedly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had already &quot;applied&quot; with one company.  After learning
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the above, I considered the application requirement to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;somewhat scam-ish, in that it would tend to lock me into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the first few companies I had talked with, and so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone that convinced me to apply in order to get the sample
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy an info would have an unfair advantage over everyone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else out there.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Plus they kept calling me asking if I had signed and sent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the policy they had sent me, although each time I asked
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them to note on their records that I had never wanted an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actual policy from them, was still looking around, etc.)
<br>
<p>3.  As it turns out, I found that despite initial claims to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy, I found that this one company I had applied with and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gotten a ready-to-sign policy from would not accept cryonics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organizations as the beneficiary or owner of the policy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently they have even gone so far as to retroactively
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cancel in-place policies where the owner tries to change the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beneficiary or transfer ownership to a cryonics organization.
<br>
<p>So given that it would be difficult to find an independent agent
<br>
who would talk with me, and given the less-than-upstanding nature
<br>
of existing companies in the reluctance in which they send out
<br>
information and in their readiness to cancel ongoing policies,
<br>
I figured it would make sense to talk with an agent who specialized
<br>
in cryonics policies--and that made a whole world of difference!
<br>
There was a shocking, night-and-day difference between my
<br>
experience with Rudi and my experiences with individual
<br>
companies!
<br>
<p>So, I would recommend talking with one of the individual agents
<br>
you listed as opposed to trying to talk directly with companies
<br>
as I did.
<br>
<p>I don't want to say too much here about Rudi, given that I
<br>
haven't talked with any of the other individuals you listed and
<br>
so I can't give a proper comparison, but I am sure that you would
<br>
also find Rudi to be helpful and professional, as well as a joy
<br>
to talk with.
<br>
<p>Oh, one problem I did have with the Will part of the Alcor
<br>
sign-up procedure was finding a notary public willing to sign
<br>
wills.  My bank, (First Union), no longer notarizes wills, and
<br>
the other banks I talked with, some of which do, will not even do
<br>
so for pay for a non-customer.  Individual notary publics are
<br>
sometimes reluctant to do so as well.
<br>
<p>I ended up going to the Sheriff's office in my county's
<br>
courthouse.  (I liked that, as it made me feel there was
<br>
less of a chance of a governmental body disputing my
<br>
intentions if the will were notarized in a Sheriff's
<br>
office.)  I don't know if that really makes much difference,
<br>
but after more than a week of trying to find someone
<br>
to notify it, (someone who would be a completely disinterested
<br>
party), it was a relief to find out the sheriff's office
<br>
would do it.
<br>
<p>I'm glad you're going through with sign-up.  Good luck with the
<br>
procedure, and please let us know how things go with the sign-up.
