<em>&gt;I found the original article to be somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we-try-hard-to-be-objective-although-naturally-we're-not-ish, so here is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;link to another article on this issue - a bit better from my point of view:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16561.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16561.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Ugh, but The Register's 
<br>
all-corporations-and-governments-are-out-to-screw-you point of view 
<br>
is more objective? :)
<br>
<p>For example:
<br>
<em>&gt;Everyone entering Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida last 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sunday was subjected to the surveillance system cameras, set up at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the entrance turnstiles. No notice or disclosure was ever given, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no one, therefore, had an opportunity to decline to enter the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stadium if they should have objected to this unprecedented treatment.
</em><br>
<p>Why would having extra security at a big event like the Super Bowl be 
<br>
a reason to give notice?  Were they doing brain scans or illegally 
<br>
tapping cell phones or something?  Would having extra officers there 
<br>
have been a reason to give notice?  Of course not.
<br>
<p><p>and:
<br>
<em>&gt;'Similar or matching.' This clearly acknowledges the possibility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that innocent civilians going about their peaceable business may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stopped, hassled, even arrested, merely for resembling someone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;naughty. This raises sticky issues regarding the presumption of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;innocence many of us were encouraged to believe in during our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grammar-school civics lessons. Is there a violation of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle when a person is required to produce evidence that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are not, in fact, the evil bastard whom they unfortunately resemble?
</em><br>
<p>This is a problem in the non-technological law enforcement world as 
<br>
well.  It's unfortunate, but mistakes in identity happen.  The police 
<br>
in such situations have a responsibility to treat suspects with 
<br>
respect and to ascertain their true identity as quickly as possible. 
<br>
Why is the technology at fault or the tactic of using the technology 
<br>
in a public place?  Maybe if the technology got a few more criminals 
<br>
off the streets, the odds of your looking like one of them would be 
<br>
reduced.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
