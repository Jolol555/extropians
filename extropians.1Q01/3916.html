<p><p>Today is Abraham Lincoln's birthday.  What would Honest Abe have had to
<br>
say about cyberspace, if he were alive today?  Perhaps something like
<br>
this:
<br>
<p>&quot;The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The
<br>
occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the
<br>
occasion.  As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.&quot;

Napster's messaging feature is increasingly used by bands or their
<br>
agents to promote their music, which some fans appreciate but which
<br>
others view as an intrusion; some companies are developing software
<br>
that can reach many more users simultaneously than can Napster's

The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics is expected to
<br>
issue recommendations by fall concerning a network to facilitate the
<br>
sharing of health information to improve medical treatment.  The
<br>
President's Information Technology Advisory Committee has also studied
<br>
the issue; both groups say their intention is not to collect personally
<br>
identifiable information but rather to use non-identifying data to get
<br>
a clearer picture of the state of health care and to enable patients to
<br>
share their own health profiles with their doctors.

Representatives James Saxton (NJ) and Saxby Chambliss (GA) introduced a
<br>
&quot;sense of Congress&quot; resolution that &quot;designates cyberterrorism as an
<br>
emerging threat to the national security of the United States which has

In _Lockheed Martin Corporation v. Dan Parisi_ a majority of the WIPO

panel ruled that &quot;both common sense and a reading of the plain language
<br>
of the [Uniform] Policy [for Domain Name Dispute Resolution] support
<br>
the view that a domain name combining a trademark with the word &quot;sucks&quot;
<br>
or other language clearly indicating that the domain name is not

affiliated with the trademark owner cannot be considered confusingly

similar to the trademark.&quot;

Members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce were critical of
<br>
the process by which new gTLDs were selected last year but did not
<br>
advocate reversing the decision, as some whose domain name proposals
<br>
were denied urged.  ICANN Chair Vint Cerf said ICANN would try to &quot;find
<br>
more objective ways to make these decisions&quot; and that an additional

round of new gTLDs could be created in as little as six months after

the seven recently selected names become operational.
