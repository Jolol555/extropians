<p>&lt;&lt; Might not need that. Ever wonder if the Executive Office has ever used
<br>
&nbsp;Delta Force to take down a loose nuke in private hands? I sure have. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;used&quot; as in 'past tense', I suspect no, for this reason: the PR Payoff would 
<br>
be sweet, indeed, for whatever president successfully disarmed Auric 
<br>
Goldfinger's plan to radiate and disperse all the gold in Ft Knox-for 
<br>
example. 
<br>
<p>Could a delta force destroy a nanotech center, or a bio-projects factory? Of 
<br>
course. But there would likely be redundancies, such as other plants built 
<br>
underground, hidden,etc. This would depend on the investment cost of such 
<br>
operations, If its in the billions, that would be it, if on a a couple 
<br>
hundred mil-could on redundancy. 
<br>
<p>For a weak example of this, please consider Saddam's governance of Iraq, 
<br>
where the fellow is likely building nukes or rad weapons or bio weapons and 
<br>
there is no political will to disarm him. This seems to be true because the 
<br>
'cost' in doing so would produce massive 'collateral damage' in the case of 
<br>
Iraqi civilians.  Now what if you are Bill Joy and you believe that you must 
<br>
disarm Saddam's 'nano-plants' at all costs? My guess is adios Iraq. In the 
<br>
case of Saddam, I personally doubt if I would disagree in this case. 
<br>
<p>If you have any rumors regarding Deltas disarming nukes, do pass the word 
<br>
though, for this would be something that would fit into Joy's misguided 
<br>
vision.
