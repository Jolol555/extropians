A few points.  First, anti-intellectual fundamentalist factions are
<br>
certainly not all religious or spiritual people or representative of
<br>
such.
<br>
<p>Second, human beings seem to have evolved with a strong belief
<br>
component, some of it difficult to resolve out from our general pattern
<br>
matching abilities, more of it refined over generations as shared belief
<br>
structures have been more survival prone within some limits.  
<br>
<p>Third, given the second point and particularly in strongly religious (by
<br>
polls) and powerful states like the US, it might be a much more
<br>
effective policy to use the power of belief turned toward more
<br>
science/reason/tech-positive a focus than to attempt to eradicate it
<br>
outright.  Personally I believe there is room and need for a
<br>
religion/spirituality/philosophy that gives a strong technological
<br>
vision of what is possible and gives shape to our technological advances
<br>
by adding  values and  vision to guide our use of science and
<br>
technology.  If you want to look at it that way the urge toward
<br>
transcendence of the biologically given that drives so much of what we
<br>
do is not that different from the same urge in most spiritual people.  
<br>
<p>Show the spiritual people how their dreams of heaven, immortality, an
<br>
end to want and so on can become actual realities here and now.  Clothe
<br>
it in God (imho an ultra SI) answering all the prayers of the ages if
<br>
that is what it takes to reach them and enroll them.  But don't try to
<br>
disown a large part of the human race or human nature.  That is a losing
<br>
position.
