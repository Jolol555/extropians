<em>&gt;Hayflick said that even if the most common causes of death -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancer, heart disease and stroke - were eliminated, &quot;the increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in life expectancy would be no more than 15 years.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With those death causes gone, he said, the true cause of death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be revealed: the aging process.
</em><br>
<p>The aging process is not a very good argument to try and counter.  There is
<br>
no such things as simply the &quot;aging process&quot; - there is always a specific
<br>
mechanism at work.  You are simply just choosing to ignore the specifics
<br>
here.

<br>
<em>&gt;Aging, he said, is a decline on a molecular level that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people &quot;increasingly vulnerable to disease&quot; and that this process
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not receiving much research attention.
</em><br>
<p>Everything in biology works at the molecular level.  This is not a good way
<br>
to introduce an argument.
<br>
<p>Damien said:
<br>
<em>&gt; It will come from a blend of the genome program data, fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational protein folding, and nanotechnology.  Neither of the latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are receiving as much funding right now as routine cardiac surgery, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but once they get past the bootstrap stage they'll be soaring up Moore's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Law's exponential curve and rebuilding human expectations.
</em><br>
<p>I would argue that there is tons of work being done in the area of
<br>
&quot;computational protein folding&quot;.  It really is a hot field right now.  But
<br>
your listing of these three keys is strange to me.  I understand it as
<br>
someone saying that &quot;we need to learn the alphabet!  You know, the vowels
<br>
and the letters B and M.&quot;  What you list is surely important to the problem
<br>
but do not really cover much of the actual problem space - there is so much
<br>
more that is important.
<br>
<p>The biggest missing element is that you neglect the activity of the proteins
<br>
themselves; the protein-protein interactions and the protein-genome
<br>
interactions (ie. transcription factors, repressors, etc...).  Also to jump
<br>
to specific biology examples: things such as nerve growth factor or stem
<br>
cells might be important in the replacement of damaged cells in the brain.
<br>
Specific &quot;aging process&quot; ailments that we need to tackle are osteoporosis,
<br>
Alzheimer's, cognitive declines (ie. learning is slower as you age, general
<br>
atrophy), eye-sight loss (ie. macular degeneration, etc...), muscle mass
<br>
loss, just to name a few that come to mind.  Although these do not directly
<br>
result in death they are signs of &quot;the aging process&quot; and then to make life
<br>
less enjoyable to live.
<br>
<p>We need to understand more than just a &quot;couple letters&quot; of the aging
<br>
process - we need the whole picture.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
