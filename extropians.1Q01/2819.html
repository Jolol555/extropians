&nbsp;==========================
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The dividend of history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The run up to the Spike will deepen today's dreadful problems, but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ease their solution, if we keep our nerve and use our brains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         A corporation that downsizes its work-force today, in favour of robots, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surviving as a beneficiary of the human investment of the past. Its current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productivity, after all, is the outcome of every erg of accumulated human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort that went into creating the economy and technological culture that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made those robots possible.
</em><br>
<p>What I am going to say here is not an argument against a guaranteed
<br>
minimum standard of living per se.  It is an argument against a
<br>
dangerous and I believe pernicious means of justifying such.
<br>
<p>This is a popular socialist argument.  It assumes that all of us, every
<br>
single humans somehow contributed something to everything we have and
<br>
therefore we all have an equal right to the fruits of human progress.   
<br>
But 
<br>
this argument is quite questionable.  The majority of human progress
<br>
comes from a relative handful of creative and energetic people, not from
<br>
the masses of humankind.  Nor is it clear that the existence of this
<br>
handful was so dependent on the masses.  The great accumulators of human
<br>
effort were the innovators and the technologists and business people and
<br>
the philsophers and ethical leaders that made their existence and
<br>
freedom possible.  The majority of humanity resisted at every step of
<br>
the way.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         So let's not look at a guaranteed income as a `natural right', like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed innate rights to freedom of speech and liberty. Rather, it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inheritance, something owed to all the children of a society whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestors for generations have together built, and purchased through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work of their minds and hands, the resource base sustaining today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cornucopia.
</em><br>
<p>But this argument does not follow.  Not all ancestors contributed
<br>
equally.  The face of human progress is not a blank or a composite of
<br>
all faces.  The work of most hands and minds was barely at subsistence
<br>
level.  All that was common to all was the dream of better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         Committed to the present structure of society--a prejudice doomed in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, as we have seen, by the on-coming Spike--some people believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of their fellow humans won't work without an external goad. Others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that incentives are required, but hold that these can spring from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within, and need not depend upon the threat of hunger and destitution. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the short run, this debate can be avoided, for a guaranteed income would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abolish severe poverty more effectively than current schemes that tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act as a disincentive to taking up part-time work.
</em><br>
<p>But the current schemes come from the same root of the right to a
<br>
guaranteed level of sustenance just for being alive to be provided by
<br>
others by force.  Now, as I've mentioned NT makes it less an enslavement
<br>
(to some degree) of others for this program.  And to that extent I
<br>
believe it is both workable and moral.  But at the current level such a
<br>
program is not moral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         And while a guaranteed wage would ensure you the bare necessities, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; craving for luxuries and a higher standard of living would hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappear. Few of us now are content merely to earn a subsistence income.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who are--the `shiftless scoundrels' who live their rudimentary life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ease on the dole in sunny climes--will continue to do so, but without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costing society the extra burden of trying to hunt them down and punish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them for refusing to take the jobs that don't exist.
</em><br>
<p>And of course these are not the only possibilities.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         What we must hope, as the juggernaut of technological change rolls onward,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that material incentives alone really are not more important than other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driving forces of the human spirit. The artist and the scientist are two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; celebrated instances of a deep human hunger and enthusiasm for creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity, the kind that draws people together while being intensely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewarding to the individual. It's very likely, no doubt, that some arduous
</em><br>
<p>The truly creative very seldom want to be &quot;drawn together&quot;.  They want
<br>
room and time to create.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; jobs traditionally the domain of depressed and excluded groups would find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no takers if survival were no longer at stake. In wealthy nations like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States, bordering less well-off countries, a constant influx of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illegal migrants testifies to the reluctance of citizens with high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectations to do the sweaty work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it testifies more to the disincentive to employment created by
<br>
our own laws hypothetically for the benefit of the poor like minimum
<br>
wage.  If you actually ask these workers they will tell you that they
<br>
are quite pleased to have this work rather than no prospects at all back
<br>
home.  Nastiness is relative.  Doing yard work in a nice neighborhood is
<br>
infinitely preferable to the conditions back home in many cases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Return to the village
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The impulse to automate such unpleasant activities, or design around them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is thus intensified. If nobody can be found to take the nasty jobs, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportion of such unrewarding tasks delegated to machines will grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (thankfully) until people are free of them for good. And in many cases, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can expect that nano minting and AI systems will simply wipe many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst kinds of odious toil off the agenda forever.
</em><br>
<p>So, you have taken people who can work the land and may actually enjoy
<br>
it and made them unemployable.  Odious is a very relative term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         Hans Moravec puts it succinctly: `In the short run this threatens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unemployment and panicked scrambles for new ways to earn a living. In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medium run, it is a wonderful opportunity to recapture the comfortable pace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a tribal village while retaining benefits of technological evolution. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the long run, it marks the end of the dominance of biological humans, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beginning of the age of robots' (Robot, p. 131).
</em><br>
<p>Who in the hell wants the pace of a tribal village!?  This was one of
<br>
the dumbest things I ever read from Moravec.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         The anthropologist Conrad Arensberg claimed that every successful adaptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation, social or biological, always has a further effect than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate and conservative: `the opening of a vast new door, a splendid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serendipity'. It is impertinent and finally futile to try to anticipate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serendipity, but it seems fair to assume that the adoption of a general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to a share in the inherited productivity of the human race will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberating, more often than not, to the spirit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It depends on whether you need to enslave some to provide this share to
<br>
all.
