<em>&gt; &gt; We see from this how far cryonics remains from the mainstream.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Blame cryonicists for that, at least partly.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, one needs an inkling in half a dozen of more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obscure sciences and branches of technology to understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem set thoroughly, and most people show criticality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in dynamics of relations to a given subject (sheeple ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or vilify new subjects until those standing high in the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hierarchy adopt them, regardless of subject's actual utility),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but cryonics seems to draw rather strange people. Anecdotally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not so anecdotally.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure the strangeness of cryonicists is the problem, simply
<br>
because I'll bet most people have never met one, and their exposure to
<br>
them on TV has been limited.  The numbers of cryonics supporters are so
<br>
small that their personalities probably haven't had much impact.
<br>
<p>I think it's an emotional reaction people have to the very idea of
<br>
cryonics.  Most people find it absurd, horrifying, and/or the ultimate
<br>
in selfishness and narcissism.  A few people don't have these reactions
<br>
and ultimately come to support it.
<br>
<p>So on this view, the strangeness of cryonicists is the effect rather
<br>
than the cause of most people's abhorrence.  The few people who don't
<br>
find the idea horrifying are peculiar in this way, and this strangeness
<br>
manifests in other ways as well.
<br>
<p>You see the same thing in other small, self-selected communities.
<br>
Libertarians tend to be rather odd, and let's face it, extropians are
<br>
not exactly average.  I'm sure the same thing happens among extreme
<br>
environmentalists, feminists, religious sect members, and so on.
