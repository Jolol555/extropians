I read the essay by William Douglass in the Economist and really enjoyed it.  Great work!!  I liked how the &quot;reality&quot; of the mid twenty-first century slowly filtered through to me as I read the essay which had been written in the first person.  Well, I bet all the Textropians are pretty proud of him right about now.  Hmm, maybe oneday there should be the Alaskatropians...  I like the sound of that.
<br>
<p>Year 2067.com has an essay contest going on.  This is taken from their site:
<br>
<p>Do you have a vision of what the world will be like in the year 2067? 
<br>
We want to know about it.  What advances will or will not have been
<br>
made in Robotics, Cryonics, Nanotechnology, Human Genetics and
<br>
Virtual Reality?  How will the different areas interact? (i.e. how will
<br>
Virtual Reality and Human Genetics interrelate, etc.)  What will
<br>
develop that we have not even thought of yet?  How will social interaction change?  
<br>
Write your vision in 500 words or less...if we like
<br>
it we'll be posting it for everyone to see.  We are also interested in
<br>
artistic or graphical future depictions.
<br>

<br>
<p>So, you don't get five grand or a coffee mug for winning but you do get recognition which is cool.  It's a small website and we could help to build them up.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
