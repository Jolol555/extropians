<p>
to post my position on this recent spiralling thread/threads about 
<br>
extremism, guns, and gun control/revoking, whether guns are okay to talk 
<br>
about, recently whether self defense is extropic, etc. i don't know anything 
<br>
about guns. i've never owned a gun. i really don't know whether they're 
<br>
neccesary, or if that's a valid question.
<br>
<p>having said that, i do have some thoughts.
<br>
<p>this list is normally very polite, very intelligent. i can think of very few 
<br>
people on this list that haven't posted something very intelligent and 
<br>
thoughtful, that i've taken to heart, or revised for my own use.
<br>
<p>i asked a question about guns on this list, i admit. and in retrospect, with 
<br>
the debate going on, i likely should have done that offlist, just out of 
<br>
respect to the &quot;non-combatants&quot; as it were. but i wanted to get a range of 
<br>
opinion.
<br>
<p>it's a little surprising to me that some of the attacks that have occured, 
<br>
did. both pro, and anti gun advocates have made rather ugly statements, 
<br>
which saddens me a bit.
<br>
<p>i really dont' know which side i fall in, or if either position is 
<br>
particularly valid. it's interesting that a &quot;bigger&quot; issue like nanotech 
<br>
weaponry, the pros, cons, ability of individuals to control it, etc, is 
<br>
readily accepted because nanotech is automatically &gt;H, no matter what it's 
<br>
use. in my view, weapon technology is weapon technology, whether nanoscale, 
<br>
or macroengineering. if that's to be banned, that sounds fine, but 
<br>
unneccesarily repressive.
<br>
<p>Max sent an email to the point that guns as tools or meta discussion of guns 
<br>
is not extropic and not relevant to the list. i would disagree, but i 
<br>
respect his position. this list is high volume as it is, and we should make 
<br>
an effort to constrict it's topics to provide higher utility to it's 
<br>
members, as well as avoid unneccesary conflict. on the other hand, i look at 
<br>
this list as something of a society of friends. i asked the question 
<br>
innocently, actually hoping that some of the people who had disagreed with 
<br>
the use of guns would reply, with arguments as to why i, as a undecided 
<br>
voter, as it were, should not associate or train with firearms.
<br>
<p>as a &quot;hopefully&quot; society of friends, associated by a transhuman interest, i 
<br>
will try to treat you guys/and gals, like i treat my friends. and when there 
<br>
is a problem between my friends, we think that there are really only two 
<br>
choices,  not to bring up the subject, and be polite, or be a little more 
<br>
aware, and work it out, finding rules and obeying them, or even just 
<br>
agreeing to disagree.
<br>
<p>so can we come to some to some sort of consensus as to what to do about 
<br>
this? i dislike unreflective conflict.
