<br>
<p><em>&gt;In normal countries like where I live ;-), nobody has a gun. Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;licensed hunters, police officers and army officers are allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have weapons. If anyone else wants to have a weapon, it's a tough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;procedure to get it - among other things, you have to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;license and register with the government, and you can be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sure you won't get a license if you have any kind of criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;record. Without a license, no purchase possible.
</em><br>
<p>I glad you're happy where you live. By the way where I live just
<br>
outside of Chicago, IL you need a license to own a gun as well, and
<br>
just as in your country you cannot get a license if you've ever
<br>
committed a serious (felony) criminal act.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Sure, there are gangs and lunatics, and they have illegal guns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But they don't shoot people all over the place - in fact, gangs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very rarely shoot anyone outside of their circles at all [for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kidnapping victims, they seem to prefer drowning], while lunatics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;typically shoot people they are angry with, they get caught
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easily, and then they get something like a 10 year prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sentence.
</em><br>
<p>It's the same thing here, in fact in big cities like Chicago, If
<br>
you know the area's to avoid, you would live here your whole life
<br>
and never see, or hear a gun.
<br>
<p>However please note that it is politically incorrect, and therefore
<br>
impolite to talk publicly about these areas and their culture of
<br>
violence.
<br>
<p>The odd part is that here if they do get caught they get a slap on
<br>
the wrist as punishment if at all. There are those of us here
<br>
trying to change that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure, the police can &quot;raid your house with a swat team, shoot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first and ask questions later&quot;. But it doesn't happen; we simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't have a national culture of shooting each other. The police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very rarely use their weapons, even in extreme cases, and each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bullet is accounted for. And that's even with our police being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somewhat corrupt - there are reports that some of them take bribes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to allow some people to do things they shouldn't, but I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heard of a police officer to shoot a person that is anything less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than an arrogant, widely known and notorious criminal.
</em><br>
<p>Same here again, although their have been cases of innocent people
<br>
being killed in there own homes by SWAT teams that had wrong
<br>
information. And of course that Elian Gonzales thing, oh, and the
<br>
Ruby Ridge thing, oh, and the Branch Davidian thing, but that's
<br>
pretty much it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, I don't think America's aversion against banning guns has any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational structure at all. There is no need to buy them back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is no need to be easy on guns. You just ban them, instate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heavy fine on owning illegal weapons, and that's it. Give everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a year or two to get used to the fact, and the problem is solved.
</em><br>
<p>You have it backwards, we don't have an aversion, the vast majority
<br>
of Americans own guns, between 65 and 80 million of us. Compare
<br>
that to the fact that 100 million voted in the last election and
<br>
you can see gun owners are a clear majority here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In particular, your argument about someone protecting themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a gun while the police &quot;raid his house with a swat team&quot; is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well, far off. I think your swat teams are expert enough that no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one will survive shooting back against them. If they want to shoot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you, they can do it anyway - pretending a gun provides any real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protection against the police is an illusion. The only thing you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might be able to do with it is kill a few good police officers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before they put a bullet in your head for doing so.
</em><br>
<p>Good police officers like any other person with common sense would
<br>
think twice before launching an assault against an armed home, but
<br>
this is very much beside the point. We are a civilized nation and
<br>
the place for disagreements is in the courts.
<br>
<p>The vast majority of my fellow gun owners see guns as tools to do
<br>
a job, nothing more. A tool you hope never to use, but one you're
<br>
damn glad to have if the need arises.
