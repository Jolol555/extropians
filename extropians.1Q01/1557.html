I wrote to Steven Stoft, a researcher at the University of California
<br>
Energy Institute, and he said that the single-price auction rule is
<br>
NOT applied on an full-day basis.  Each auction is only for that hour.
<br>
(He further emphasized that as-bid would probably not save significantly
<br>
over single-price.)
<br>
<p>The only evidence I have found to the contrary is that one sentence in
<br>
the press release from the FERC.  The full text of the FERC order refers
<br>
to the single price auction in many places, but never says anything about
<br>
the maximum price of the day being used.  They only talk about the effects
<br>
of single-price vs as-bid in the context of a specific auction period.
<br>
<p>So perhaps this is simply a misstatement on the part of the PR people
<br>
at FERC who prepared the press release, attempting to explain what a
<br>
single-price auction means for the lay public, and missing the mark
<br>
themselves.  That would make much more sense.
<br>
<p>Is there other evidence available that the California markets actually
<br>
follow this highest-price-of-the-day policy?
<br>
