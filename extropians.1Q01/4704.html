Consider Greg's discussion where he starts by quoting Barbara:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I agree with Greg that if you want to win an argument, you must understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the opponent's position as clearly as you understand your own. I'd say you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  must do more than figure out how they're effective at organizing and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  their message out; you must also understand the rational points in
</em><br>
favor of
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  their arguments. 
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;Right, Barbara, which is one problem with the nature of discussion 
</em><br>
<p>The problem starts with failing to discern the crucial difference between
<br>
discussion and debate.  In the real world, despite their apparent
<br>
similarity, these two words represent phenomena which are poles apart.  To
<br>
whatever degree you see them as similar, you expose yourself to extreme
<br>
political vulnerability.  Greg chooses his words carefully and uses them
<br>
with great precision, and therefore I conclude that when he used the word
<br>
discussion above, he meant discussion.  But 'the nature of discussion' is
<br>
NOT the issue.  Not at all.  The nature of debate/political persuasion, not
<br>
discussion, is the issue.  Discussion is a pleasant and often fruitful
<br>
cooperative interpersonal activity.  In a political world with real power
<br>
and real lives at stake, debate is the rhetorical equivalent of combat.
<br>
<p>Greg analyzes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;which is one problem with the nature of discussion about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues that greens and other anti-progressives have co-opted in the public 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discourse: They have become subjects of &quot;activism&quot;, which is inherently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;polemical and adversarial.  By no later than 1980 or so, people who saw 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions of human interaction with the natural environment as inherently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political had begun to shape the cultural milieu in which they were
</em><br>
discussed 
<br>
<em>&gt;in terms of &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;anti&quot;.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It would be GREAT if we could unwind this polemical dialectic, and I'm wide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;open to suggestions of how to do it.
</em><br>
<p>That's what I'd like to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think you're right that always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looking hard at FACTS, is a way to do this, but it's equally important to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work the rhetoric &quot;downward&quot; to first principles and moral assumptions.  
</em><br>
<p>Right.  The key is 'rhetoric' and what it is, and what it isn't.  What it
<br>
isn't is 'discussion', a fundamentally rational and intellectual activity
<br>
employing facts and rational analysis.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  I would add that most people don't know how to think logically--
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I wish I could be hopeful on this point, but I do not see any increase in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationality or critical thinking in our society at large or in the media 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;streams that influence it.
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>A person employing rhetoric--defined as &quot;the art (or study) of using
<br>
language effectively and persuasively--must have a talent for the logical
<br>
employiment of rhetorical techniques to be successful  Critical thinking by
<br>
the rhetorician is essential.  But those upon whom rhetoric is practiced
<br>
will be more easily persuaded--ie manipulated by those rhetorical
<br>
techniques--in proportion to the weakness of their (logical) thinking
<br>
skills.  Since rhetorical techniques derive their effectiveness from
<br>
emotion far more than facts, truth, or rational analysis, the smart and
<br>
successful rhetorician will dispense with these latter whenever they fail
<br>
to provide a competitive advantage, which is almost always.  In debate,
<br>
which is the medium of rhetoric, winning is everything.  Politics is the
<br>
dynamic social application of rhetoric.  The organization of society and
<br>
the distribution of power is the result.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see the on-going process of translation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of ideas and values into ideology, which in turn spawns simple cultural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;icons, sloganeering and manipulative polemics.
</em><br>
<p>Because emotional manipulational 'works', it displaces everything
<br>
else--logic, fact, truth, rationality.  The only logic that matters is
<br>
rhetorical logic.  For those who would take pride in their rationality,
<br>
remember, pride is emotion. 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip historical examples of ideological polarities and the consequent
<br>
forced choosing of sides and the polarization-moderating  principle of
<br>
'cleavages'&gt;
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...one reason for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of polarization I describe ... is the tendency of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the greens to speak of these things as &quot;true&quot; in some absolute, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decontextualized sense.  
</em><br>
<p>Speaking in 'decontextualized' absolutes invokes the emotions directly without
<br>
any of the disadvantageous dissipation of too much thinking  (&quot;Thus
<br>
conscience [thinking] doth make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue
<br>
[vitality] of resolution is sicklied o'er by the pale cast of thought, and
<br>
enterprises of great pitch and moment [emotive power and force], with this
<br>
regard [excessive thoughfulness] their currents turn awry, and lose the
<br>
name of action.&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... if one looks at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rhetoric of green and luddite ideologues, one sees an almost complete
</em><br>
absence 
<br>
<em>&gt;of weighing of costs and benefits.  
</em><br>
<p>No politician will throw a wet blanket of facts on the fire of his
<br>
follower's frenzy--least of all a set of facts which refutes and
<br>
demystifies their redemptive and empowering gospel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The dystopian, negative view of science and technology has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somehow become the accepted foundation of just about every &quot;mainstream&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consideration of these things.  For instance, at this point it seems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inconceivable that someone would fund the production of a major Hollywood 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movie in which science or technology was portrayed in a positive light, much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less as a tool to be affirmatively grasped to solve human problems.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not convinced this is as much an indication of genuine cultural
<br>
hostility as it is a literary quirk.  Writers know that human audiences
<br>
want heroes with whom to identify.  These can be humans, animals, ET, or
<br>
'number five'.  At the same time heroes need worthy adversaries to serve as
<br>
foils for their heroism.  Powerful technologies, soulless 'things' of
<br>
vastly superhuman power, make terrific villians.  They fit the bill
<br>
precisely because we are already thoroughly convinced of their power.  But
<br>
they can just as easily be allies in the literary world--as indeed, for the
<br>
most part, they are in the real world--if you can just find another
<br>
villian, such as bad humans, bad aliens, nature run amok, or a separate,
<br>
but evil, technology.
<br>
<p>I've gotten off topic here.
<br>
<p>To reclaim the dialectic you must distinguish between the dialectic of
<br>
discussion, a fundamentally rational activity, and the dialectic of debate
<br>
which is political action in action.  In the politics of Luddism the
<br>
ambitious self-serving political leadership of the Luddite herd seeks to
<br>
whip it into a frenzy and send it stampeding toward their political
<br>
adversaries with the intent of stomping, routing, and scattering them into
<br>
political defeat.  You won't reclaim the dialectic by reasoned and
<br>
temperate discussion with the stampeding herd.  For this dialectic you need
<br>
something with (counter-)action potential like loud frightening noises,
<br>
barbed wire, or a stampeding herd of you own, headed on an intercept
<br>
course.  And then, you only need such a defensive response if the Luddite
<br>
herd is genuinely dangerous, and not some phantom of media feedback and
<br>
exaggeration.  Which is my view.
<br>
<p>The luddite-lites of today are mere chittering henny-pennies, impressed
<br>
with their own fierce screeching, and intoxicated with the fantastic
<br>
delusion--&quot;the impostume of too much wealth and peace&quot;--that they are
<br>
crusaders on an heroic mission to rescue imperiled Gaia. 
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, they're out-manned, out-resourced, and out-motivated by their
<br>
opposition.  Responsible grown-ups, a vast legion of scientists the world
<br>
over, and even vaster legions of hard-working people made eminently
<br>
practical by enforced austerity strive for better living through
<br>
technology, coping as gently as they can with overprivileged homo hystericus.
<br>
<p>Pedantic waste of bandwidth.  Nevermind.
<br>
