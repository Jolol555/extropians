<p><em>&gt;Apparently, thanks to a mere thunderstorm, rolling power blackouts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are expected across California this afternoon. I think one thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unmentioned is the fact that demand is hardly inelastic. It has,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in fact, shot up by 13% in a single year thanks to a) internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;use, and b) the added load of state mandated electric cars: i.e
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two things not unforeseeable by power planners five years ago. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know I was warning about it on the Bonneville Power sponsored
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conservation email lists from 92-95.
</em><br>
<p>Good points, at least it should be good business for Greg Burch's
<br>
clients, and extropian investors.
<br>
<p>I saw that California is having a bad weather day again, I hope
<br>
you're all staying dry.
<br>
<p>Deregulation is a complex issue, especially if the people doing the
<br>
deregulating don't understand the industry, or basic economics.
<br>
<p>I've tried but since given up trying to explain telephone
<br>
deregulation to people. People keep asking me, &quot;When is there going
<br>
to be competition.&quot; I explain that I hook up 2 to 3 &quot;competitors&quot;
<br>
a day, for the last three years. But the fact is that residential
<br>
phone service has always been subsidized by business, so nobody is
<br>
interested in offering residential service, but competitors abound
<br>
in the business market.
<br>
<p>This will (and has) led to a deterioration in the residential
<br>
service market, and will eventually lead to HIGHER prices as the
<br>
revenue subsidy drys up.
<br>
<p>They were sold a bill of goods, and bought every word.
