Physics fans on extropians, Robert Bradbury and I have been
<br>
discussing offlist various aspects of plasma physics with Amara
<br>
Graps, who has obviously put a lotta effort into her replies
<br>
in spite of her extremely busy schedule preparing for her PhD
<br>
defense in the upcoming months.  With her kind permission I
<br>
will post a good plasma tutorial written by Amara.  The discussion
<br>
came about because of Robert's ideas regarding Matrioska
<br>
brains.  If you want to get up to speed on m-brains, do check
<br>
the the extropians archives first as Robert has already posted
<br>
tutorial material.  Our questions and Amara's answers follow.
<br>
<p>********************************************
<br>
<p>Hi Robert and Spike,
<br>
<p><p>I think that plasma physics is not very intuitive, both to
<br>
physicists and nonphysicists (and including me).
<br>
<p>Probably it's best to start with some of the plasma basics, and then
<br>
lead up to other concepts, in order to answer your questions.
<br>
<p>PLASMAS
<br>
<p>The plasma state is the fourth state of matter: heating a solid
<br>
makes a liquid, heating a liquid makes a gas, heating a gas makes a
<br>
plasma. I'm sure that you know that. Plus there are different kinds
<br>
of plasma.  A completely ionized plasma contains only free negative
<br>
electrons and positive ions (= protons). A partially ionized plasma
<br>
is partially ionized molecules/atoms with the remainder electrically
<br>
neutral normal moleculs and atoms. One can also have an
<br>
&quot;ambiplasma&quot;, which is a mixture of protons and antiprons, but also
<br>
electrons ad positions. When protons and antiprotons collide, Yowza!
<br>
Annihilation.
<br>
<p>Most of the Universe consists of plasma. Interstellar and
<br>
intergalactic plasma, because of its very low density and state of
<br>
ionization, differs appreciably from the dense plasma of stars.  In
<br>
interstellar space the number density is about one atom in every
<br>
cubic centimeter, and is partially ionized. In intergalactic space,
<br>
the density is about one atom per cubic meter. Our interplanetary
<br>
space has a plasma that is dominated by the Sun's solar wind at a
<br>
typical density of 1-10 particles per cubic cm. (My reference for
<br>
these numbers is Alfven and Longair)
<br>
<p><p>COLLISIONLESS PLASMAS      (reference: Longair, pp. 305-307)
<br>
<p>The following description shows the long distances involved
<br>
between particle collisions in many plasmas; this example is our
<br>
solar system, and therefore, why we can call them &quot;collisionless
<br>
plasmas&quot;.
<br>
<p>In a plasma, collisions are mediated between long-range
<br>
electrostatic forces between the electrons and protons. A useful
<br>
parameter to know for a plasma is how long is the time t_c for a
<br>
particle to make a collision. Longair works out a simple expression
<br>
using a physical description of a proton of velocity v interacting
<br>
with stationary protons and electrons of a plasma, and he determines
<br>
that the proton particle suffered a collision if the direction of
<br>
its velocity changed 90 degrees. The collisional time (see his text
<br>
for how he derives the expression) is:
<br>
<p>t_c = [ 2 pi eps_0^2 m^{1/2} (3kT)^{3/2} ] / [Z^2 e^4 N ln(Ga)]
<br>
<p>eps_0 = permittivity constant
<br>
m = the mass of the proton
<br>
k = Boltzmann constant
<br>
Z = atomic number
<br>
Ga = Gaunt factor
<br>
e = electric charge
<br>
<p>This is just the simple case, and a more complete treatment is given
<br>
in Spitzer: _The Physics of Fully Ionised Gases_ (1962).
<br>
<p>To see what 'collisionless' means, apply the above equation
<br>
to the interplanetary medium (from Spitzer).
<br>
<p>t_c = 11.4 x 10^6 [ (T^{3/2}A^{1/2} ) / (N Z^4 ln(Ga) ) ]
<br>
<p>T = temp in K
<br>
N = number of particles in cubic meter
<br>
A = = the mass number of the particles
<br>
<p>For the Solar Wind,
<br>
T = 10^6 K
<br>
A = 1
<br>
N = 5 x 10^6 m^{-3}
<br>
Z = 1
<br>
ln(Ga) = 28
<br>
<p>The mean free path is lamda = v * t_c
<br>
v = a typical thermal velocity of a proton in a plasma at
<br>
temperature T:  (1/2 mv^2 = 3/2 kT).
<br>
<p>Therefore lambda, our mean free path = 3 x 10^{13} m
<br>
<p>Note: The distance from the Earth to the Sun is 1.5^{11} m !!
<br>
Or, putting another way, the mean free path for our proton
<br>
is ~5 times the Sun-Pluto distance.
<br>
<p>FLUX FREEZING
<br>
<p>A long mean free path can be expressed another way: equals a &quot;very
<br>
high conductivity&quot;. In the limit of infinite conductivity, the
<br>
magnetic field behaves as if it were frozen into the plasma. This
<br>
phenomena is known as &quot;flux freezing&quot;. (Longair, pg. 323)
<br>
<p>So you can imagine a collisionless plasma as a volume where the
<br>
particles move as &quot;parcels&quot; of [plasma + magnetic field]. This &quot;flux
<br>
freezing&quot; (perhaps Hannes Alfven's largest contribution to the
<br>
plasma physics field) is a very important aspect of plasma physics
<br>
for many astrophysical plasmas. Even though the particles have very
<br>
long mean free paths, the presence of even a very weak magnetic
<br>
field ties the particles together.
<br>
<p>(From Alfven)
<br>
Let's assume that the magnetic field in interstellar space is
<br>
10^{-5} Gauss (the Earth's magnetic field is about 1/2 Gauss) and
<br>
that the plasma particles have a temperature (i.e. thermal motion,
<br>
which can be quite &quot;hot&quot; even though space is &quot;cold&quot;) of 10^4K. If
<br>
the magnetic field was not present, then the atoms would travel
<br>
about 10^13 cm  before encountering another atom. However with the
<br>
presence of the magnetic field, the atom (proton say), would move
<br>
about 10^7 cm (250 km) before encountering another particle. So the
<br>
feeble magnetic field reduced the freedom of motion of the charged
<br>
particle by a factor on the order of millions or billions of times.
<br>
<p>You may wonder *how* the presence of the magnetic field reduces the
<br>
motion.
<br>
<p>When the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma, the charged
<br>
particles of the plasma gyrate about the magnetic field direction at
<br>
their gyrofrequency. They don't move freely, you see. Not only is
<br>
the particle's motion restricted to they gyro-motions, but the
<br>
magnetic field typically varies in intensity and direction, which
<br>
tightly controls how the particles move. A magnetic field
<br>
sufficiently strong enough may propel the particles in opposite
<br>
directions. Often, magnetic fields in space act as mirrors, where
<br>
the particles oscillate between two turning points in their spiral
<br>
orbits. Therefore, their freedom of motion is greatly reduced even
<br>
in the direction of the magnetic field.
<br>
<p>The gyro motion and radius of ions and electrons move differently
<br>
with respect to the same magnetic field. If both kinds of particles
<br>
have the same energy, then the gyroradius of the electron is much
<br>
smaller than the gyroradius of the ion, and it moves in the opposite
<br>
direction. The more energetic the particle, the larger is the
<br>
gyroradius.
<br>
<p>SHOCK WAVES in COLLISIONLESS PLASMAS  (from Longair, pg. 323)
<br>
<p>The last concept I wish to introduce is the idea of shock waves in
<br>
this collisionless plasma environment. Some or many violent
<br>
astrophysical events create shocks. The thickness of the shock front
<br>
is the same order as the mean free path of the particles. However
<br>
the presence of the magnetic field determines the dynamics of the
<br>
shock. The effective friction and viscosity needed to transfer
<br>
momentum and energy through the shock wave are provided by the
<br>
magnetic field, which is tied to the particles of the plasma. The
<br>
distance over which energy and momentum are transferred is, to order
<br>
of magnitude, the gyroradius of a particle (so for Solar Wind
<br>
events, the gyroradius of the proton in the interplanetary magnetic
<br>
field.) The _mechanism_ by which energy is transferred is really
<br>
complicated: probably through various forms of plasma wave
<br>
interactions involving the magnetic field.
<br>
<p>BTW: The Earth's magnetosphere has a &quot;bow shock&quot;, which is a
<br>
standing shock in the Solar Wind ahead of the Earth's magnetosphere.
<br>
The magnetic field of the Earth forms an obstacle to the
<br>
supersonically flowing Solar Wind. The bow shock slows the Solar
<br>
Wind to subsonic speeds, so that the Solar Wind can flow around the
<br>
magnetosphere.

<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p>Now to see if I can illuminate your questions regarding Coronal mass
<br>
ejections:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;a) Is a mass-ejection from a star, primarily an ionized plasma
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   and does it remain a plasma as it travels through space?
</em><br>
<p>It's complicated. I'm not even sure that it is clear to the solar
<br>
physicists yet. I had to look at some Web sites to get a better idea
<br>
of the current understanding of CMEs, but it would be better for you
<br>
to look in journal articles. I'll just tell you what I found from my
<br>
Web and other readings, in particular:
<br>
<p>*I didn't save the URLs, but I found a &quot;report&quot; by the American
<br>
Geophysical Union, which had pages with titles: &quot;CMEs Near the Sun&quot;,
<br>
&quot;CMEs in the Heliosphere&quot;, so search on that with google and it will
<br>
turn up. That report seemed very factual, with many journal
<br>
references. The only possibly negative aspect of the report was it
<br>
seem to be about 6 years old.

*_Physics of Solar System Plasmas_ by Thomas Cravens, Cambridge
<br>
University Press, 1997.
<br>
*_Introduction to Space Physics_, edited by M. Kivelson and C.
<br>
Russell, Cambridge University Press, 1995.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a good picture of a CME is a &quot;magnetized plasma
<br>
cloud/bubble&quot; or a &quot;magnetic flux rope&quot;. They carry large amounts of
<br>
plasma (probably ionized) and magnetic fields into the heliosphere.
<br>
The mass quantity I read in my Time-Life _The Sun_ book (possibly
<br>
dated information) is about 10 billion metric tons of material,
<br>
which is a significant fraction of what the solar wind disperses in
<br>
a day.
<br>
<p>CMEs appear to arise from large-scale,  preexisting coronal
<br>
streamers (NOT from coronal holes, and don't confuse these CMEs with
<br>
prominences, either). Many energetic CMEs are actually the
<br>
disruption of a preexisting streamer, which increases in brightness
<br>
and size for days before erupting (like a balloon.. have you seen
<br>
those movies?) as a CME.
<br>
<p>I am sure that the CME remains a plasma as it travels through space,
<br>
but I'm not certain of the details &quot;how&quot; it travels. My guess that
<br>
it would likely be a &quot;plasma wave&quot; with shocks preceding it in the
<br>
Solar Wind. Please use the picture that I described above of &quot;Shocks
<br>
in Collisionless Plasma&quot;. Cravens' book has a diagram on page 245 of
<br>
a schematic of a CME. The picture shows a cloud of size about 1AU,
<br>
where the coronal gas acts as a &quot;piston&quot; pushing out into the slower
<br>
ambient Solar Wind. The shock wave moves out ahead of the
<br>
disturbance. Cravens gives the reference: Burlaga, L. et al, &quot;A
<br>
magnetic cloud and a coronal mass ejection,&quot; Geophys. Res. Lett. 9,
<br>
1317, 1982.) CMEs are now thought to be the prime cause of large
<br>
geomagnetic storms.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;b) If it is a &quot;hot&quot; plasma traveling through space, why doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   it radiate heat and rapidly cool down?
</em><br>
<p>I think that it does.. but in a &quot;shocking&quot; way :-)
<br>
<p>A shock front moving outward through the Solar Wind overtakes the
<br>
slower-moving plasma ahead of it, accelerating and heating the
<br>
material that it sweeps up. The shock thus transfers momentum and
<br>
energy to a widening region of Solar-Wind plasma. Unless such
<br>
momntum and energy are continually replenished, the shock must be
<br>
decelerated as it moves outward through the solar system.
<br>
<p>To understand the generalities of how shocks behave, one must go to
<br>
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). MHD describes the plasma at the level of
<br>
the macroscopic fields (electric and magnetic) and quantities such
<br>
as the density and bulk-flow velocity. Because MHD does not include
<br>
effects due to individual particles (&quot;kinetic&quot; effects), it cannot
<br>
tell us anything about how a shock provides dissipation or what the
<br>
structure of the shock will be. But it can describe the plasma far
<br>
upstream and downstream of the shock.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Kivelson, pg. 150
</em><br>
One way to describe the dissipation at a shock is to say that
<br>
despite the lack of collisions, there is an &quot;effective resistivity&quot;,
<br>
producing viscosity, producing heating dependent on velocity
<br>
gradients. In this case, the effective resistivity and viscosity
<br>
must be provided by changes in particle velocities caused by
<br>
perturbations in the fields. In other words, waves in the fields
<br>
replace collisions between particles. It's a behavior called:
<br>
collective dissipation, because the fields and the particles act
<br>
together.  More explicitly, look at a current as a result of a
<br>
distortion in the particle distibutions. This distortion can drive
<br>
instabilities, which produce turbulence within the shock. The
<br>
particles feel the turbulence and suffer small changes in their
<br>
velocities, which has the same effect as if they were colliding with
<br>
other particles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;c) Related to this is the question of why astronomers point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   that some gases (say those emitted from supernova explosions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   or spiraling down into black holes) are at temperatures of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;millions&quot; of degrees (presumably radiating in X-ray regions)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Is it related to the velocity of the ions or the degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   ionization?  If it is the degree of ionization (i.e. all outer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   electrons have been stripped off), what happened to the electrons?
</em><br>
<p>I think that the astronomers have to be clear about what physical
<br>
process the temperatures refer to!
<br>
<p>Accretion disks' luminosities are often approximated with a
<br>
blackbody formula, using the inner and outer radius of the disk:
<br>
<p>2(pi r1^2 - pi r2^2) (sigma T^4) = luminosity
<br>
<p>Temperature here refers to the velocity of the particles, and so in
<br>
thermal equilibrium 1/2 mv^2 = 3/2 kT.
<br>
<p>There are different astrophysical processes though, where one finds
<br>
temperatures given. Longair's _High Energy Astrophysics_ might be
<br>
the best source to sort it out. He has separate chapters for what he
<br>
calls &quot;interaction of high energy particles with matter&quot;.
<br>
<p>Longair's first chapter deals with &quot;ionization losses&quot;, which is
<br>
part of your question. Here: ionzation loss is the ionization and
<br>
excitation of the atoms and molecules of the material. The electrons
<br>
are torn off atoms by the electrostatic forces between the charged
<br>
high energy particle and the electrons. This is not only a source of
<br>
ionization, but also a source of heating of the material because of
<br>
the transfer of kinetic energy to the electrons. The &quot;temperature&quot;
<br>
would be the energy of the incoming high-energy particle, typically
<br>
given in &quot;electron-volts&quot;. You can convert the radiation from hot
<br>
bodies with this conversion:
<br>
<p>E = kT = 1.380E-23 T J
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 8.617E-5 T eV
<br>
where the temperature T is in K.
<br>
<p>I imagine that the stripped off electrons become part of the plasma,
<br>
and in then in some circumstances, recombine.
<br>
<p>Longair's next treatment of &quot;interaction of high energy particles
<br>
with matter&quot; considers ionization losses of electrons, and then
<br>
bremsstralung radiation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;d) Spike had tried to convince me that in a plasma, hot atoms radiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   photons that get rapidly reabsorbed (keeping the plasma &quot;hot&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I had countered with the density of plasmas seemed very low
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   and I didn't see how the plasma could keep the photons from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   radiating away into space.  What determines the likelyhood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of interaction between a photon (or an electromagnetic wave)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   and atoms (or ions) of a specific density?  (After all light can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   go through solid glass with relatively little interaction...)
</em><br>
<p>Maybe Spike was taking about photoionization?
<br>
<p>Photons with wavelengths shorter than 912 angstroms (the Lyman
<br>
limit), can photoionize the hydrogen atom, with the excess photon
<br>
energy above the energy of the Lyman limit contributing to the
<br>
kinetic energy of the freed electron. In reverse, a free electron
<br>
may be captured by a free proton with the emission of a photon. If
<br>
the electron is captured in an excited stated of hydrogen, it may
<br>
subsequently cascade to the ground level by the sequential emission
<br>
of a number of line photons. This is called &quot;recombination radiation&quot;
<br>
and plays a role in fluorescence.
<br>
<p>I think that it is safe to assume that in the case that Spike was
<br>
referring, the plasma is not collisionless, and maybe the best
<br>
environment for us that shows photoionization is our Earth's
<br>
iononosphere. This environment is really complicated: you start with
<br>
a neutral atmosphere, and the source for ionization (where ions are
<br>
being produced) could be photoionization, or impact ionization.  The
<br>
photons would come from the Sun. Then, for the impact ionization,
<br>
the particles can come from the galaxy (cosmic rays), the Sun, the
<br>
magnetosphere, or from the ionosphere. In addition, energetic
<br>
electrons can produce more ionizing photons within the atmosphere
<br>
via bremstrahlung (braking radiation).
<br>
<p>I only mention ion production in the previous paragraph, but you
<br>
also have ions being lost, via various recombination mechanisms.
<br>
<p>The best reference for ion production and losses that I saw in my
<br>
reference books was the chapter: Ionspheres in Kivelson and
<br>
Russell's book: _Introduction to Space Physics_.
<br>
<p>By the way, dust particles are strongly affected by photons in two
<br>
ways: 1) they acquire charge gained by currents generated by
<br>
photoelectron emission, 2) radiation pressure force on the dust is
<br>
dependent on whether (and how) the particle extinguishes, scatters
<br>
and/or absorbs photons. These processes, however, are _independent_
<br>
of any characteristics of the plasma.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;e) Katherine Freese and David Graff (heavy hitting theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   physicists) have argued that the interaction between multi-TeV
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   gamma rays and the diffuse infrared background radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (see refs at end) constrains the abundance white dwarfs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the galaxy. [question follows]
</em><br>
<p>I won't answer this question now, because I need some more time to
<br>
think about it, and I'd rather just mail all of this off to you now.
