<em>&gt;If your statement is true, then why do the people in every other culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invariably want the sort of society we have? They want 4 door cars, PCs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;internet access, good neighborhoods and schools, honest elections, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all of the other features of the America that isn't marred by big city
</em><br>
<em>&gt;welfare state problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, I do make exceptions. The French, for example. ;) They are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exception that proves the rule...
</em><br>
Got the cars, PCs, schools etc.  DON'T want the theocratic government with
<br>
no PR voting.
<br>
<p>Sorry, did you say &quot;HONEST ELECTIONS&quot;??  *James feels overwhelming gurgle
<br>
of laughter build in his stomach..*
<br>
<p>Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more....
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>

&nbsp;The Last election WAS honest...he bought it fair and square!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An &quot;Honest&quot; election is an election that you (and your allies) buy mostly
<br>
non-violently, rather than swim in blood to get.  A Dishonest election is an
<br>
election where you methodically and brutally assure that as many as possible
<br>
contenders never get the chance to aquire the rescources to buy the election
<br>
fair and square...the others you can't shoot you have to deal with, the ally
<br>
with the most money (or it's equivalent) gets the spot at the top, the rest
<br>
of the crew divide the remaining spoils.
<br>
&nbsp;THIS IS DEMOCRACY! God bless America.
<br>
&nbsp;When I realized that the only society without inherent corruption was a
<br>
graveyard...then I began to grow wise.....
