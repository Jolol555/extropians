Regarding my question of Hofstadter's translation of Pushkin's
<br>
_Evgenij Onegin_.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:natashavita@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Interpreting%20dead%20people's%20creative%20works%20(was:%20Riddles%20...)&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b67b9b0e9858@[213.23.5.44]&gt;">natashavita@earthlink.net</a>, Wed,  3 Jan 2001

[good list of Pushkin references]
<br>
<p>Thank you very much, Natasha, for all of that information regarding
<br>
Pushkin.
<br>
<p>The Web, for me, is both a curse and a blessing. A curse because I
<br>
usually don't have the time, typing hands, or money to spend time on
<br>
the Internet and I tend to postpone searches on authors' works until
<br>
I have trips, a few times per year, to bookstores/libraries in an
<br>
English-speaking country. It's a blessing because I know that the
<br>
information is on the Web, if I get desparate.
<br>
<p>Thank you Chris, Barbara, Eugene (offline) and especially to Kat
<br>
(offline) for the information regarding Hofstadter's version of
<br>
_Evgenij Onegin_.
<br>
<p>I am skeptical of Hofstadter being a poet, that's why I wanted to
<br>
get my hands on the book to see for myself. The original is generally
<br>
considered, by the Russian-speaking folks I know, to be
<br>
untranslate-able, and the translator would have to be a poet
<br>
him/herself, and understand the style, emotions, etc. of Pushkin to do
<br>
justice to the original.
<br>
<p>However, I think that Hofstadter showed a lot of courage to tackle
<br>
this work, and I understand that he was not Russian-fluent before he
<br>
started the project, and used the project to become more proficient
<br>
in the language. Therefore, I would probably buy the book because I'm
<br>
impressed that he undertook (and probably succeeded) at this effort.
<br>
<p>I was thinking a lot during the last days of what it means to
<br>
interpret or translate another person's creative work. The first
<br>
question to ask of the translator is probably &quot;is he/she true to the
<br>
original?&quot; If the originator is *dead*, then one either must spend
<br>
years in studying effects from that person, as well as studying the
<br>
necessary medium (e.g. language) to express the work close to the
<br>
original, or else NOT... and then the viewer/reader/listener/etc.
<br>
must accept that the translated/interpretted work is &quot;derivative&quot;,
<br>
&quot;evolved-in-time&quot;.
<br>
<p>Observing interpretations of creative work over time can be
<br>
interesting, anyway, for learning some things of society in
<br>
historical contexts.
<br>
<p>In the music world, musicians and conductors have to face this
<br>
situation every day when interpreting works from long-dead
<br>
composers. For example, I would prefer (the contemporary musician)
<br>
Nigel Kennedy's renditions of works of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky,
<br>
Vivaldi, Sibelius (Violin Concerto in D minor never fails to bring
<br>
tears to my eyes) over any other classical musician at any other
<br>
time. I wasn't alive at the time of these composers, but I'm
<br>
reasonably sure, from what I know of N.K., that Kennedy was not true
<br>
to the originals.
<br>
<p>Poetry can be alot more complicated to translate and interpret. It
<br>
seems to me that it is tied much deeper to the language and to the
<br>
culture and other social contexts than music. Form, rhythm, rhyme,
<br>
and embedded meanings within meanings would need to be translated.
<br>
<p>Form.
<br>
<p>For example, here is the form of the Shakespearean sonnet (which is
<br>
different from the earlier-introduced Italian sonnet):
<br>
<p>The lyric poem is divided in 4 ways, three quatrains (4-line verse),
<br>
each with a rhyme scheme of its own, usually alternating lines, and
<br>
a concluding &quot;couplet&quot; at the end that rhymes. The typical
<br>
Shakespearean sonnet rhyme scheme is &quot;abab cdcd efef gg.&quot; The couplet
<br>
at the end is often a commentary on the preceding quatrains.
<br>
<p>Take a look:
<br>
<p>(William Shakespeare, 1564-1616, from _Sonnets_, Sonnet 18)
<br>
<p>a  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
<br>
b  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
<br>
a  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
<br>
b  And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
<br>
<p>c  Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,
<br>
d  And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
<br>
c  And every fair from fair sometimes declines,
<br>
d  By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;
<br>
<p>e  By thy eternal summer shall not fade,
<br>
f  Nor lose possession of that fair thou os'st;
<br>
e  Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
<br>
f  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:
<br>
<p>g  So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
<br>
g  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
<br>
<p>[Question to the non-native English speakers here: have you seen a
<br>
translation of this sonnet, and if so, how far does it succeed in
<br>
keeping true to the original?]
<br>
<p>Some metaphors and images in Shakespeare's 18th sonnet.
<br>
<p>eye of heaven --&gt; the Sun
<br>
fair from fair sometimes declines --&gt; everything has its own time
<br>
beauty of women &lt;--&gt; beauty of nature
<br>
unchanging, immortal
<br>
<p>The following is another example, this one with a hugely-varying
<br>
rhyme scheme. Note that poets, using various rhyming schemes, can
<br>
almost create musical effects on the ear of the reader.
<br>
<p>Check this out:
<br>
<p>(Edmund Spenser, 1552-1599, from _Epithalamion_, lines 167-184)
<br>
<p>a  Tell me ye merchants daughters did ye see
<br>
b  So fayre a creature in your towne before,
<br>
a  So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,
<br>
b  Adornd with beautyes grace and vertues store,
<br>
c  Her goodly eyes lyke Saphyres shining bright,
<br>
c  Her forehead yvory white,
<br>
d  Her cheekes lyke apples which the sun hath rudded,
<br>
c  Her lips lyke cherryes charming men to byte,
<br>
d  Her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded,
<br>
d  Her paps lyke lyllies budded,
<br>
f  Her snowie necke lyke to a marble towre,
<br>
g  And all her body lyke a pallace fayre,
<br>
g  Ascending uppe with many a stately stayre,
<br>
f  To honors seat and chastites sweet bowre,
<br>
h  Why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze,
<br>
h  Upon her so to gaze,
<br>
i  Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,
<br>
i  To which the woods did answer and your eccho ring.
<br>
<p>[Now, doesn't that put a smile on your face??]
<br>
<p>Therefore, a translator, to be true to the originals, would not only
<br>
need to keep the form of the poem, but would also need to keep the
<br>
images, metaphors, mood, and perhaps the context of the time (in these
<br>
examples: to 16th century Britain.
<br>
<p>OK, A little Friday-afternoon rambling....
