<p>One cannot murder the willing.  The term would be facilitating their
<br>
cultural suicide.  If people are given technology and choose to trash their
<br>
culture and folkways, trading them for *our* culture and folkways, then
<br>
I have nooooo problem with this brand of cultural imperialism.  If we
<br>
build it, they will come.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...So what sort of memes and practices do we lay to

</em><br>
<p>Easy.  Simply offer advanced technology, at a price.  They will pay it.  People
<br>
all over the world will be given an opportunity to purchase leap-frog
<br>
technologies, with economies of scale already in place.  They will
<br>
enjoy a foretaste of the singularity in a sense, as they advance the equivalent
<br>
of a technology packed century in a few years.  Destructive superstitions
<br>
and religions designed for agrarian cultures will be hurled into the
<br>
ideological trash.  Sure they may suffer displacements, but those
<br>
societies will develop ways of dealing with rapid change.  We need
<br>
not tell them how to embrace fast change, they will teach us.  They
<br>
will be used to it, they will *expect* everything to be different every
<br>
year.
<br>
<p>Those who have been given a warmup course in rapid technological
<br>
change (by getting electricity, internal combustion, and communications
<br>
all in the same decade) will be in even better shape than us westerners
<br>
who have suffered from slower technology growth.  spike
