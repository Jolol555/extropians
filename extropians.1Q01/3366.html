<em>&gt; Yes, but you still need the refinery, and some processing to build more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than one-offs. With nano, I guess we are home free, here. Alternatively, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can send numerous supply drones ahead of the colonists, as many have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocated - then the infrastructure is ready before the colonists leave home...
</em><br>
<p>Shipping a refinery would be needed in any event. One prototyping system
<br>
and one pickup truck sized micro-refinery to produce handfuls of
<br>
material at a time is all thats needed. Make the prototyping system able
<br>
to reproduce every part in a refinery, all heavy industrial equipment,
<br>
and scale upwards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is the intelligence of the parrot real, or because it can talk? I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard varying opinions on &quot;birdbrains&quot;...
</em><br>
<p>I've seen parrots play with dogs for hours. A friend had one that would
<br>
take his Newfoundland dog for a walk around the block for him, sitting
<br>
on  its neck. The newfie was kept in check by pecks from the parrots
<br>
beak.
<br>
<p>Very well, take squirrels, who exhibit very high puzzle solving
<br>
intelligence. A human brain carries great redundancy to protect against
<br>
heat and shock damage over a human's life. Improving a neuron's ability
<br>
to withstand these shocks would allow smaller brains with equal
<br>
intelligence. Shrinking the size of a neuron also does the same.
