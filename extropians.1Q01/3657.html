<p>So men should be able to grope women whenever they want to, since 
<br>
they're not even generating a dry-cleaning bill.  Or at worst, if 
<br>
they get a smudge on the woman's clothes, they should have to pay a 
<br>
dry-cleaning bill.  So for a few bucks, men who don't fear a little 
<br>
female indignation could cop all the feels they wanted to.
<br>
<p>Interesting.
