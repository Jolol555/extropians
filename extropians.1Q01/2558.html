<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  According to Martyn Fogg's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; _Terraforming_ it is likely technically feasible in the near future to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; launch enough dust into the stratosphere to induce a multi-degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cooling. So what do I do when the Netherlands decide to lower the mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperature and I want to raise it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why, you burn, and they sequester. Now, if your burning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; externalization of wastes causes them damage, they rightly have a case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to pursue compensation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, makes sense to me. Climate as an economic tug-o-war.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, you want to improve the value of your land, they want to preserve
<br>
the value of theirs. If your improvements have externalities that impact
<br>
their value, you are obligated to compensate. The question, though, is
<br>
whether your pollution is going to actually damage their property or
<br>
just change its optimum use.
<br>
<p>A smart person would see that flooding Holland would result in many
<br>
thousands of hectares of valuable mariculture lagoons to raise seafood
<br>
for europe. Is mariculture more valuable a crop than tulips?
<br>
<p>Like the classic 'butter or guns' argument, we are dealing with a 'trout
<br>
or tulips' argument. A smart Swede would start buying up Dutch land
<br>
ahead of time while property values are low, and buy property in
<br>
Greenland as well to build communities on to handle the refugee traffic.
<br>
<p>Similarly, a 3 foot rise in sea levels would vastly expand the amount of
<br>
coastal wetlands in the US, especially along the Gulf Coast. The
<br>
possible economic as well as environmental benefits of this are nearly
<br>
incalculable.
<br>
<p>Moreover, there would be other benefits to warming: during the last
<br>
warming trend, the Sahara was a lush grasslands and forest with abundant
<br>
rainfall. The current desert environment there has been found to be a
<br>
primary cause of damage to coral reefs in the Atlantic and Indian
<br>
Oceans, where airborne dust from the desert settles so far from home.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The fact is that there are proposals to seed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oceans with iron to stimulate plankton blooms which seems to be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effective way to sequester the huge amounts of carbon that some claim we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need to get rid of. Such proposals are being ignored by global warming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proponents, so it seems to me that they really don't have an interest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solving the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I mentioned above, I'm reading the terraforming book which has some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older data on this. I also read the review of the issue in last week's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature (Earth systems engineering and management by Stephen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; H. Schneider, Nature Vol 409, 18 January 2001). Schneider gives some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons geoengineering has not been pursued in recent climate debate;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think most of them are wrong on one level or another but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geoengineering doesn't seem to have been deliberately ignored. Rather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has been seen as too risky, distracting from anti-pollution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiatives, possibly unethical and not possible to implement due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unreliable governance. Beside the purely practical points efforts like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this runs into the divide between what Fogg calls the ecocentric and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technocentric approaches to planetary management; in addition both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches often fall into the pitfall of outdoing each other in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centralist technocracy. I think we can do much better in our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I think so too. The iron seeding proposals have already been tested to
<br>
great success, with no ill effects. I fail to see how green arguments
<br>
against them can have any significant weight outside of being a squeaky
<br>
wheel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree with your view that greens dislike geoengineering because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would leave them without anything to complain of and enlarged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment programs would benefit them. If you actually discuss with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them you realise they think it is morally wrong, infeasible or too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous. The same with most people against breeder reactors - they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are simply afraid of the evil nuclear power or the links to weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production. We might disagree with these sentiments, but assuming your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents doesn't even believe their own arguments is a dangerous kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of underestimation. A bit of self-serving thinking is of course always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present, but assuming this is the main source of passion of most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's opponents is a mistake.
</em><br>
<p>I don't doubt that most of them *conciously* have excellent reasons,
<br>
howsoever irrational or unsupported by science. Its fitting that they
<br>
generally hate science, because it is so effective in illustrating their
<br>
irrationality. Note, however, that many people will rationalize why they
<br>
want or don't want something with reasons that are often completely
<br>
different from their subconcious motives. Denial is a powerful
<br>
subconcious drive. In my reading of their propaganda, I have come to the
<br>
conclusion that the key people can't really beleive this crap and still
<br>
be intelligent enough to lead such large numbers of people. Such people
<br>
must be completely concious of their true motives or else have severe
<br>
mental problems.
