<p>I think the g topic is perhaps emblematic, because since any tool can be
<br>
a weapon (even a butter knife), how such issues are addressed bears on
<br>
how humans will deal with much more potentially hazardous tools, such as
<br>
Project Orion style propulsion systems and strong nt, or even
<br>
self-directed evolution. 
<br>
<p>The Mike Lorrey vs Joe Dees flakfest, specifically, is rather a
<br>
set-piece by now, and little news is forthcoming from it. The biggest
<br>
news I've gotten there is that I'm part of the problem. Could have
<br>
fooled me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i dislike unreflective conflict.
</em><br>
<p>I do, too. I was attempting reflective communication; perhaps I failed.
<br>
I wish I hadn't felt obligated to *PLONK* Mr. Dees. But &quot;guilt by
<br>
association&quot;, and reactive crypto-extremism, cut precisely zero ice with
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>In any event, welcome. Here's a towel, wipe the blood off, pull up a
<br>
chair and let's talk about something less controversial, like Friendly
<br>
AI or whether philosophy is obsolete. :)
