Add Marker Gene To Rhesus Monkey That Glows Green
<br>
<p><p>PORTLAND, ORE., JAN. 11, 2001 (CBS News) - Researchers have created the
<br>
first genetically modified primate in the world, a baby rhesus monkey whose
<br>
name -- ANDi -- stands for &quot;inserted DNA&quot; spelled backward.
<br>
<p>Born in October, the male monkey carries a tiny extra bit of DNA in a gene
<br>
introduced as a marker that can be seen under a microscope because it
<br>
actually glows green, researchers at Oregon Health Sciences University said.
<br>
<p>Lead researcher Gerald Schatten tells CBS News Correspondent Lou Miliano
<br>
this discovery will open doors for &quot;making the models that will actually
<br>
eradicate so many of the diseases we fear today.&quot;
<br>
<p>The creation of ANDi was described in the Friday issue of the journal Science.
<br>
<p>Researchers hope they now can introduce other genes in rhesus monkeys that
<br>
could trigger a host of human diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, breast
<br>
cancer or HIV in order to find a way to block them at the genetic level.
<br>
<p>The technique for inserting the gene has been used for more than a quarter
<br>
century in mice, but comparing a mouse to a human being has limits, said
<br>
Schatten. He is leading the research at the university's Oregon Regional
<br>
Primate Center.
<br>
<p>Because monkeys are close cousins to humans in terms of DNA, they may give
<br>
scientists a better picture of how human disease develops, he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think we're at an extraordinary moment in the history of humans,&quot;
<br>
Schatten said Wednesday.
<br>
<p>A year ago, Schatten reported the first monkey successfully cloned by embryo
<br>
splitting. That monkey is named Tetra. ANDi and his surrogate mother, as
<br>
well as Tetra, remain healthy, Schatten said.
<br>
<p>ANDi received an extra gene while he was still an unfertilized egg.
<br>
<p>Schatten, lead author Anthony W.S. Chan and other researchers modified and
<br>
then fertilized more than 200 rhesus monkey eggs. Forty embryos were
<br>
produced, and resulted in five pregnancies and three live births. Of the
<br>
three baby monkeys, only ANDi proved to have the modified genes.
<br>
<p>Dr. Ray Greek, spokesman for the Physicians Committee for Responsible
<br>
Medicine, said it was unnecessary to proceed with modifying a primate to
<br>
introduce a human disease when such work can be done at the cellular level.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think it's going to get them a lot of press,&quot; Greek said, &quot;and will
<br>
eventually translate into getting OHSU a lot of money.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But 20 years from now will your children be safer from cancer, heart
<br>
disease, etc., as a result of this? The odds are astronomically against it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Schatten said the modification should help researchers find cures for human
<br>
diseases faster, eventually ending the need to use animals. He also said the
<br>
technique will limit the number of monkeys needed because test animals can
<br>
actually be genetically designed, rather than creating a large pool of test
<br>
animals in hopes that one will have the desired characteristics.
<br>
<p>&quot;Researchers around the world believe that a lot of diseases like cancers,
<br>
like mental illnesses like diabetes and other degenerative diseases could
<br>
actually be cured, and cured within just a few years,&quot; Schatten said.
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't think any of us would want to make primates sick unless it would
<br>
truly accelerate the day that diseases can be eradicated.&quot;
