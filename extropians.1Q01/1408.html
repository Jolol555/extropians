<p><em>&gt;Also, effects that some folks on this list can contemplate with
</em><br>
equanimity are events that would horrify many people outside
<br>
of extreme sci-fi/technophilic circles.  For example, Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky has said on many occasions that, as long as the human
<br>
race survives long enough to give birth to some sort of superintelligence,
<br>
the ultimate fate of humanity is of no consequence (to him or,
<br>
presumably, in the ultimate scheme of things).  I suspect that
<br>
this attitude is part of what gives folks like Bill Joy the willies.&lt;
<br>
<p>I might agree with the statement has the word “human” rather
<br>
than humanity.  When humanity is flung around carelessly, it’s
<br>
worth a double take.  I rather appreciate the humanity in humans
<br>
and I have a strong incentive to see that it become a highly
<br>
intelligent transhumanity and later posthumanity.  Discarding
<br>
“humanity” as an element of humans that as unimportant or trivial
<br>
is in itself questionable.
<br>
<p>While my views are obviously strongly in favor of human/machine
<br>
interface and the advancing of our species beyond our biological
<br>
past, I shun at the thought that consciousness could be of little
<br>
value.  
<br>
<p>The branches of learning (as philosophy, arts, or languages)
<br>
that investigate human constructs and concerns along with processes,
<br>
such as in physics or chemistry, and social relations, such as
<br>
in anthropology or economics, have provided extropians with skills
<br>
and knowledge to discern our possible future.
<br>
<p>The qualities that cause us to be transhuman, as the qualities
<br>
that will cause our descendents to be posthumans or to be mind
<br>
children will be due in large part to the manner in which these
<br>
descendents cogitate data and function.  To assume they will
<br>
be blocks of metal without ideas, thoughts, concerns, likes and
<br>
dislikes is so far from what our goals that it would cause me
<br>
to shutter.

<br>
<p><em>&gt;If most people have never looked at things this way, I believe
</em><br>
it is because they have never been presented with the argument.
<br>
&nbsp;Not everyone is persuaded, of course.  
<br>
<p>Yes, I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But most people who laugh at or scorn Extropians for their technophilia
</em><br>
have never considered the issues deeply. Over time I believe
<br>
we will see more people coming to share our views, and in fact
<br>
this is already manifest in the increasing public prominence
<br>
of Extropianism.&lt;
<br>
<p>I don't think most people scorn or laugh at us.  Most people
<br>
don't know who we are, and those who do are curious and perhaps
<br>
reluctant about us or respect us. While extropians may be questioned
<br>
for our values and thought of as insensitive to humanity, I honestly
<br>
think that we are well aware of many of the problems that humanity
<br>
faces. It is vastly important that we develop ways to extend
<br>
human life, advance technology, improve our conditions and advance
<br>
our species. As you, I believe that we will have increasing social
<br>
appeal and cultural significance.
