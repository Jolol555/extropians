<p>I believe you've changed the definition mid-course. The more usual
<br>
connotation of directed evolution, sans theology, might be closer to the
<br>
program under investigation by the Arnold group, led by Frances H. Arnold,
<br>
Professor of Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry, Division of Chemistry
<br>
and Chemical Engineering, Caltech. E.g.:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cheme.caltech.edu/groups/fha/Enzyme/directed.html">http://www.cheme.caltech.edu/groups/fha/Enzyme/directed.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt; To appreciate the challenge of designing and carrying out a successful
<br>
directed protein evolution experiment, it is important to underscore the
<br>
powerful combinatorial features of this system. A typical enzyme is a
<br>
linear chain of N amino acids (N is usually several hundred), and there are
<br>
20 possible amino acids at each position in the chain. Thus the `sequence
<br>
space' of possible proteins is huge beyond the imagination (20^N ). Even in
<br>
4 billion years, nature has had a chance to explore but a tiny fraction of
<br>
these possibilities. A laboratory exploration of this vast space of
<br>
sequences and their corresponding functions must obviously be severely
<br>
limited and carefully guided [Arnold, 1998a]. Because much of sequence
<br>
space will be devoid of the desired function and probably even folded
<br>
proteins, it is best to direct the evolution of one (or more) existing
<br>
enzymes rather than look for function in random peptide libraries.
<br>
<p>Evolution is often referred to as a hill-climbing exercise in the fitness
<br>
landscape of sequence space
<br>
[Eigen, 1986; Kauffman, 1993]. The fitnesses (performance, for laboratory
<br>
evolution) of the proteins in
<br>
sequence space make up this landscape, whose most basic features are still
<br>
quite unknown. The
<br>
landscape for laboratory evolution will be different for each property or
<br>
collection of properties
<br>
undergoing evolution. I have argued [Arnold, 1996; Arnold, 1998a] that an
<br>
uphill climb in a
<br>
landscape is more likely to be successful if it can take place in small
<br>
steps (one or two amino acid
<br>
substitutions). The high dimensionality of the surface (there are 19^N
<br>
one-mutant neighbors of any
<br>
given sequence) offers many opportunities to find improved mutants. While
<br>
we may never reach the
<br>
'global optimum', the improvements achieved by taking even a simple random
<br>
up-hill walk via single
<br>
amino acid mutations often yields useful results. A widely effective
<br>
evolutionary strategy, illustrated
<br>
in Figure 2, is one in which the steps are small (preferably single amino
<br>
acid substitutions in each
<br>
generation) and multiple such mutations are accumulated, either
<br>
sequentially or by recombination
<br>
[Stemmer, 1994; Stemmer, 1997], to acquire the desired function [Arnold,
<br>
1996; Arnold, 1998a]. Such
<br>
an approach is compatible with a low level of random mutagenesis over the
<br>
entire gene. An alternative approach is to direct a much higher level of
<br>
random mutation to a relatively small region of the gene [Black et al.,
<br>
1996]. Both approaches have their advantages. Mutagenesis over the entire
<br>
gene allows discovery of unanticipated solutions (a common experience).
<br>
More intense, directed mutation, however, may yield novel combinations of
<br>
amino acid substitutions, combinations that would be inaccessible by single
<br>
step walks because the  intermediates are unfavorable. &gt;
<br>
<p>This thread began with the hoary proposition that human minds are far too
<br>
wonderful not to have been designed by a Designer (that is, by implication,
<br>
a sort of Cosmic Professor Arnold). That's a far stronger claim than the
<br>
observation that if water freezes to falling snow, in this universe, under
<br>
common earthlike conditions, you always find symmetrical snowflakes rather
<br>
than blotchy lumps or small white tigers: self-organization? sure; divine
<br>
or pantheistic intervention? I rather doubt it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course, it seems to have gone the way of most threads here.  People
</em><br>
<em>&gt;telling jokes.  People attacking each other's character and intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>That's because the use of the term in the main stem of the thread was (or
<br>
seemed) crypto-theological. What other response than parody and mockery do
<br>
you expect on this list?
