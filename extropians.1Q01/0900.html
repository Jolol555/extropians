Look, you keep talking like this thing was supposed to be the final word
<br>
on the subject. I don't think it is. I think it's the proverbial stake
<br>
in the ground. 
<br>
<p>The question of just how far ahead a crazy bad guy could get, compared
<br>
to sane people also working on nt, is a crucial one. You have put your
<br>
finger on a fertile area for study. I am not sure what the probability
<br>
distributions are, and I am not sure how to figure them.
<br>
<p>If you take a gander at <a href="http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/index.html">http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/index.html</a>,
<br>
you'll find a link to &quot;Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology
<br>
/ Original Version 1.0: February 21, 1999 / Revised Draft Version 3.7:
<br>
June 4, 2000 / © Foresight Institute and IMM. Do not publish draft
<br>
without permission.&quot; Check out the Preamble, Para 1, last 3 sentences,
<br>
and Para 5. These people are taking the issue seriously, too.
<br>
<p>OK, suppose the probability distribution includes a possible lump of
<br>
people following the guidelines. Let's imagine there are fifty research
<br>
teams worldwide working just on replicators. Let's assume there is one
<br>
ultrabad (either malevolent or shortsighted) ultrabrilliant opponent.
<br>
Game it out. Now change the numbers. Twenty teams, two Evil Geniuses. Do
<br>
it again with ten teams, three E. G.s. 
<br>
<p>At some point in there, trouble happens. Now run the numbers the other
<br>
way. What if there are no people using the guidelines, and a thousand
<br>
research teams all working on replicators that can survive in the wild?
<br>
Bad, no?
<br>
<p>Being able to respond to an E. G. means being pretty much as up to speed
<br>
as he is. Lollygagging is not an option for the good guys, it seems.
<br>
This does not mean that the good guys have to build replicators that can
<br>
go feral, any more than CERT has to disseminate computer viruses.

<em>&gt; Yeah. Obviously Drexler at least was thinking about

<em>&gt; Publication? Funny you should mention that; I'm a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journalist. (published in Omni, Parade, etc. Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interviewed Crick on neural nets and human vision, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mag--Omni--went under before printing it.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; As should be obvious from previous posts, nuclear

<em>&gt; Q: Just what forum would you recommend for a response

</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotta tell you, Freitas' nanomedicine is

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yah. I find it interesting that the thing

<em>&gt; &gt; It

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It shouldn't take more than a few minutes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reflection to realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a copyright date only refers to publication. I have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some people take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decades before they publish. It all depends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My guess is that Mr. Joy's media attention certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had some effect on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completion and publication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You want criticisms? I'll give you two:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Ecophagy.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Biovorous.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; OK, so you don't like Freitas having a penchant for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neologisms. Hardly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fundamental flaw in the work, it seems to me. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; title was already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The issue of what countermeasures would work after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; notice of the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is definitely worth further exploration. Why don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you work up something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for publication?
