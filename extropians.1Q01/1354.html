<em>&gt; Thanks. Basically I'm thinking of an all-terrain, omnivorous kinda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guy--water, rock, soil; wouldn't really matter. Could be a single design, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something which produces environment-specific assemblers (water, rock, soil, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if that would reduce size/complexity and, thus, increase speed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replication. Something stripped down for speed, but still adaptable. Larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size/number of arms will at some point prove counterproductive in terms of replication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interval.
</em><br>
<p>The design for such a beast is far beyond anything I've heard of people
<br>
attempting, even in the broadest terms.  Omnivorous goo will be a
<br>
difficult problem.  Consider the energy considerations: some things
<br>
cost a lot of energy to take apart, like rock.  We may or may not be
<br>
able to reclaim the energy in putting the pieces back together.  Plus,
<br>
some materials will be rich in what the goo likes to eat, while others
<br>
will be missing crucial elements except in trace amounts.
<br>
<p>If you look at Freitas Ecophagy paper you see he did look at some
<br>
special cases that might be easy, like gray goo which only eats asphalt,
<br>
or only eats rubber tires.  By having a fixed &quot;food&quot; the design becomes
<br>
much simpler, and if it is something that civilization depends on and
<br>
is standardized around the world, the goo could be maximally destructive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I'm not mistaken, Drexler's logic (assembler arm can move back and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth 50 million times faster than a human arm (approx 150 million times a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second))--times however many arms there are--has gotta yield an astonishingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast replication rate--much faster than Freitas' stated rate. Particularly as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drexler envisioned a larger assembler (100-150 million atoms). But then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Freitas' work is more recent than EoC, which is where I read this.
</em><br>
<p>On basic scaling principles, a human arm is about a meter, while the
<br>
assembler arm is about 100 nm, a factor of 10^7 difference, which would
<br>
suggest that the assembler arm could be 10 million times faster than
<br>
the human arm.  How fast it can construct things would then depend on
<br>
how efficient its movements can be, how long it takes to form bonds,
<br>
and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If (for simplicity) each back-and-forth-cycle is moving only one atom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't we talking replication of a 150 million-atom assembler in 1 second? And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9.3 replications of a 16 million-atom assembler?
</em><br>
<p>I think Freitas was being conservative on the slow side, saying that even
<br>
if it &quot;only&quot; did 1 million atoms/sec you could still get macroscopic
<br>
quantities sufficient for medical use in an hour or two.  You on the
<br>
other hand want to be conservative in the other direction and say that the
<br>
gray goo could potentially reach macroscopic size in seconds or minutes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm trying to get a handle on just how fast the things can reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initially, i.e.--before their descendants can't get out of the way fast enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid slowing them down. (By which time the maximum replication rate would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only be attainable by the &quot;leading edge&quot; assemblers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>Your best bet is to pick a range of numbers and see how the scenarios
<br>
play out depending on whether we turn out to be on the high or low end
<br>
of the range.  That is roughly how Freitas did it in his Ecophagy paper.
