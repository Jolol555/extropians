<em>&gt;According to <a href="http://www.hockey.net/~wb0bwl/tom/paper/old/magnitud.htm">http://www.hockey.net/~wb0bwl/tom/paper/old/magnitud.htm</a>,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after several pages of calculus assuming &quot;the surface brightness appears

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;One interesting thing I found that comes out of this is that the phase

<em>&gt;factor is 1 for full phase and 1/pi for quarter phase which means the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planet is over 3 times brighter when it is full compared to half full.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So according to this calculation (which I didn't try to verify),

</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Yes, and the odd effect where the ground gets very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;luminous is when the sun is behind the camera, and thus
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the camera is looking from about the same direction as the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sun. The result is that there is a halo around the caste
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shadow of an astronaut's head, as seen in these images:

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Halo around head shadow not bright, but it's there:

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the &quot;halo effect&quot; is around the top of the

&nbsp;&nbsp;caste shadow of the lunar modle, probably near where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the head shadow of the astronaut on the module would be:

<p><em> &gt; One thing I notice as I review Apollo images is that the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; lunar surface appears to have a specular-reflection effect
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that causes some areas of lunar surface to reflect brighter
</em><br>
<em> &gt; than other areas relative to sun &amp; viewer positions
</em><br>
<p>There is a definite effect on the Moon in which the soil directly
<br>
opposite the sun appears much brighter.   If you have 'Full Moon'
<br>
by Michael Light, take a look at plate 44 of the Lunar Module
<br>
(Apollo 12) and plate 45, the astronaut's shadow imaged during
<br>
the Apollo 17 mission.     In the latter shot the ground in the
<br>
antisolar direction is very bright making the astronaut appear
<br>
to be surrounded by a bright halo.
<br>
<p>This effect is caused by the lack of shadows near to the antisolar
<br>
direction rather than specular reflection.    The lunar soil structure
<br>
is such that there are deep shadows in the interstices between
<br>
the particles.  These shadows are not visible when looking directly
<br>
away from the sun and so the soil then looks brighter there.   The
<br>
effect called the 'opposition effect' contributes to the brightness of
<br>
the Moon around full as seen from Earth.   It also makes Mars
<br>
brighter around opposition - hence the name.
<br>
<p>The opposition effect can be seen weakly on Earth - when
<br>
flying over winter forests for example.  I have seen it once (weakly)
<br>
in dry beach sand.  I did not have a camera and have been back to
<br>
that the beach many times since without seeing it again.
<br>
<p>On Earth there is a related effect, the 'heiligenschein' (holy light).
<br>
This is caused by quite the opposite conditions from those on the
<br>
Moon.  Droplets of dew on the ground scatter sunlight sharply
<br>
backwards producing a bright light around the shadow of the head
<br>
of the observer.   Stand on a sunlit dew covered lawn early in the
<br>
morning to see it.   Take a photograph ad the holy light surrounds
<br>
the camera instead.
<br>
<p>The opposition effect is not exclusive, there are no doubt other
<br>
optical effects produced by the lunar soil.   Take a look at the Apollo
<br>
images in Michael Light's book.  The lunar soil looks like.. ..nothing
<br>
on Earth!
