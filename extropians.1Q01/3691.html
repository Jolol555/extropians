<em>&gt;Any others that come to mind?  spike
</em><br>
<p>I'm assuming that we're talking about suspended animation here, and 
<br>
not just specifically being frozen.
<br>
<p>- There was that Mel Gibson movie, &quot;Forever Young&quot;.
<br>
- The old Star Trek where Kahn and his people are discovered had them 
<br>
in suspended animation.
<br>
- ST:The Next Generation thawed out and cured some people who were 
<br>
supposed to be early 21st century cryonic subjects who were sent into 
<br>
space.
<br>
- ST:Voyager had everyone on the ship but 7 of 9 go into suspended 
<br>
animation while they passed through some special area of space.
<br>
- In &quot;Alien&quot;, Sigourney Weaver goes into suspended animation at the 
<br>
end of the movie.
<br>
- There was that awful Stallone movie with Wesley Snipes, &quot;Demolition Man&quot;.
<br>
- How do you think that Buck Rogers got to the 25th century?
<br>
<p>Ugh, why am I doing this the hard way?  It just occurred to me that 
<br>
if you go to &lt;<a href="http://www.imdb.com">http://www.imdb.com</a>&gt; (Internet Movie DataBase), you can 
<br>
do a plot search for &quot;cryo&quot; and &quot;suspended animation&quot;.
<br>
<p>I just checked it out, and you get a whole bunch of hits.  You can 
<br>
take it from here. :)
<br>
<p>Have fun,
<br>
