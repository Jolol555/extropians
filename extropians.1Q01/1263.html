Excuse me.  I like guns as well as the next &quot;gunnie&quot; but that doesn't
<br>
mean I have to talk about them in every single mailing list and venue or
<br>
that I wish to read about them in every single list.  I thought we
<br>
hashed this out before.  Take it to &quot;exi-freedom&quot; (which unfortunately
<br>
seems to have nothing BUT gun stuff these days) please.  
<br>
<p>I could see some value in a bit of gentle and well placed proselytizing
<br>
on a general list now and then.  But monopolizing a speciality list to
<br>
talk about the details of one's own private gun collection and the
<br>
merits and merits of this or that firearm ?  That could only be of
<br>
interest to the choir and annoying and at best irrelevant to others.  It
<br>
is rude.  Ditto for engaging in a general flamewar and food-fight over
<br>
guns and the right to talk about them.  Standing up for the right of
<br>
self-defense does not justify rudeness.  Please stop.
