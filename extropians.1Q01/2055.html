<p>This is true.  Microsoft plays dirty tricks to sabotage the 
<br>
competition.  Most people will not have debugged Microsoft's stuff 
<br>
enough to figure out what is going on inside.  Not to start an 
<br>
anti-Microsoft discussion, but here are some examples:
<br>
<p>- font smoother in Windows serves smooth fonts to Internet Explorer 
<br>
and jagged fonts to Netscape
<br>
- server serves Internet Explorer first but delays serving Netscape
<br>
- server refuses to give Netscape common gif or jpeg formats, but 
<br>
serves an error message that Netscape can't display these images but 
<br>
Internet Explorer can
<br>
- takes control of Novell printer and then when finished, gives it to 
<br>
other Windows systems first, delaying the Novell printer queue until 
<br>
all windows systems are done printing
<br>
- writes invalid HTML code that fails to work in other browsers, then 
<br>
extends Internet Explorer to read the invalid code so it works
<br>
- bought Apple technology to create Windows, and then claimed that 
<br>
Windows 3.0 was not the same Windows they built with Apple source code
<br>
- promised IBM Windows technology for OS/2 including all future 
<br>
versions of Windows, but then claimed Windows 95 was not the same as 
<br>
Windows.
<br>
- used open-source Kerberos source code while promising the open 
<br>
source foundation they will publish their source code, then published 
<br>
source code but only to people who sign an agreement not to compete 
<br>
with Microsoft
<br>
- set cheap prices for servers as long as they did not support 
<br>
Netscape or link to Netscape's site, those that did had to pay much 
<br>
higher prices *retroactively* as a punishment for supporting the 
<br>
competition
<br>
- put delays in Excel for Macintosh so it would run slower than Excel 
<br>
for Windows
<br>
- gives developers degraded system calls while their internal 
<br>
software developers use better system calls so competitor software 
<br>
can never work as fast or as well as Microsoft products
<br>
- Java deliberately breaks security rules so that they can add more features
<br>
- Java deliberately checked platform so that it would act differently 
<br>
for Windows than other systems
<br>
- signed agreement  not to change the Java syntax one bit, but then 
<br>
used tricks to act differently with the same syntax such that the 
<br>
same command would act different for different systems or situations
<br>
<p>Most people who dislike Microsoft do so because they support open and 
<br>
fair competition.  The way to win in the market should be to build a 
<br>
better product, not sabotage a competitor's product.  Sometimes it 
<br>
seems that Microsoft puts more work into sabotaging other products 
<br>
rather than making their product better.
