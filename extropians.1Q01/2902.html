I had to respond to this.

</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  So dont move much of humanity.  Start now and get
<br>
people there by having them be born there.  Technically it would
<br>
be necessary to send only one person.  Since I now have accepted
<br>
the fact that I will never hear the end of it, I will repeat an earlier
<br>
notion that the minimal Mars colony starts with one person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Like there being no known way the colony could break even or be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-supporting in less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oh about a dozen generations.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense, sorry Samantha.  The colony would need to be
<br>
self supporting from the time it left the ground.  Sending
<br>
supplies would pretty much be outta the question.  It is too
<br>
expensive to soft land stuff on Mars, and even with modern
<br>
tech, its hard to hit an exact target.  It all goes together in
<br>
one mission.  Please keep reading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like the dearth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteers to go endure utterly horrid conditions and a huge likelihood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of death with no discernible golden lining for quite some time.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed this is a problem, but this crowded planet has over 6E9
<br>
persons to choose from.  Also recall that the ideal candidate may
<br>
come from that segment of society that is not accustomed to
<br>
having the chance to do cool things.  You are I are used to having
<br>
things go our way, are we not?  It does not surprise us when
<br>
good things happen, when we get chances to do stuff.
<br>
But people who are poor, uneducated, unhealthy, etc, do not
<br>
get these chances.  This competition is open to *everyone*.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, please, everyone here, stop and think hard: what
<br>
skills would *really* be *required* for an astronaut heading
<br>
to Mars to start a colony?  I suggest these:
<br>
<p>1.  Determination to survive.
<br>
2.  Low weight.
<br>
3.  Very small appetite.
<br>
4.  Ability to endure loneliness, but with the complementary
<br>
ability to endure more virtual &quot;company&quot; than one could
<br>
possibly imagine.
<br>
5.  Functional uterus.
<br>
6.  Collection of frozen embryos.
<br>
<p>Skills that astronauts have had in the past, but would not
<br>
be needed for this mission.
<br>
<p>1.  Education (why would that be needed?)
<br>
2.  Social graces
<br>
3.  Literacy (the messages could be translated to and
<br>
from voice.)
<br>
4.  English  (messages could be machine translated
<br>
from any language.)
<br>
5.  Legs  (Where is she gonna go?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly where do you believe the money will come from to fund such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misadventure?
</em><br>
<p>Goooood question.  The only reason I could think of for a business
<br>
enterprise to take this on is that the communications from the colony
<br>
would be worth a cool fortune.  If one could figure out a way to
<br>
encrypt, receive and sell the email from Mars to those who are interested
<br>
in what the Martians have to say, then private business might be able to
<br>
carry the expense.  I would pay 10 bucks for a day's transmissions,
<br>
for instance, and would likely pay that on a 3-4 times a month
<br>
basis.  I would estimate 10 million subscribers around the world,
<br>
so the payback would be worth about a 5 billion dollar investment.
<br>
<p>To get such a mission down to 5 billion, we would surely need to cut
<br>
some corners, which is why I keep coming back to the single tiny
<br>
person.  The lander would need to be very small, and of course
<br>
carry with it all the equipment needed to create an underground
<br>
artificially lit farm.  I agree it is a hell of a challenge.  A way cool one.
