<br>
<p><em>&gt;Not true. It simply indicates that I thought Bush was handed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presidency unfairly. If Gore had won by the same or similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tactics, I would have made the same comment. My problem is and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will continue to be the fact that we, the American people, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been screwed, they did it blatantly, and very few people seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;care about it. I am not a supporter of Gore or the Democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;party, and thought he handled himself poorly. If you see this as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me being partisan, I guess there's nothing I can do about it. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obviously have a different definition of the term.
</em><br>
<p>I'm curious as to what you saw that was unfair about the election.
