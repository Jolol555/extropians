<p>Worry more: we don't need to wait for nanotech, normal biotech is
<br>
already doing quite well all by accident. The following article details
<br>
what sort of stuff can happen by accident. I frankly have more faith in
<br>
the security of nanotech that is engineered from the ground up
<br>
purposefully rather than depending on the hit and miss techniques of
<br>
biologists today:
<br>
<p>Thursday, January 11 3:00 AM SGT 
<br>
<p>Aussie scientists stumble across the Doomsday Bug
<br>
<p>PARIS, Jan 10 (AFP) - 
<br>
<p>Australian gene engineers accidentally created a mouse virus that kills
<br>
every one of its victims by wrecking their immune system, a discovery
<br>
with the potential for
<br>
making the ultimate terrorist weapon, New Scientist reports.
<br>
<p>The killer bug was invented quite inadvertently, while the researchers
<br>
were trying to create a contraceptive vaccine for mice as a pest
<br>
control, the British weekly
<br>
reports in next Saturday's issue.
<br>
<p>They inserted into a mousepox virus a gene that creates large amounts of
<br>
interleukin 4 (IL-4), a naturally-occurring molecule that produces
<br>
antibodies in the
<br>
immune system.
<br>
<p>The idea was to stimulate antibodies to destroy eggs in female mice,
<br>
thus making the rodents infertile.
<br>
<p>Mousepox, a close relation to smallpox, normally only causes mild
<br>
symptoms among the type of mice being used in the study, and was only
<br>
being used as a vehicle
<br>
to deliver the IL-4.
<br>
<p>But when the IL-4 gene was inserted, the engineered virus ran amok,
<br>
attacking the &quot;cell-mediated response&quot; -- the part of the immune system
<br>
that fights viral
<br>
infection. All the animals in the study were wiped out in just nine
<br>
days.
<br>
<p>Worse, the engineered virus was astonishingly resistant to vaccines. A
<br>
vaccine that would normally protect these mice from mousepox only worked
<br>
in half of the
<br>
mice exposed to the killer version.
<br>
<p>Co-researcher Ron Jackson, of the Canberra-based institute CSIRO, said
<br>
the discovery was a frightening indicator of what could happen if the
<br>
human smallpox
<br>
virus was similarly modified.
<br>
<p>&quot;It would be safe to assume that if some idiot did put human IL-4 into
<br>
human smallpox, they'd increase the lethality quite dramatically,&quot; he
<br>
told New Scientist.
<br>
<p>&quot;Seeing the consequences of what happened in the mice, I wouldn't want
<br>
to be the one to do the experiment.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's surprising how very, very bad the virus is,&quot; said Anne Hill, a
<br>
vaccine experts from Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland,
<br>
Oregon.
<br>
<p>Smallpox has been eradicated as a disease thanks to a global vaccination
<br>
campaign, although two laboratories -- one in the United States, the
<br>
other in Russia --
<br>
still have ampoules containing the virus, under an arrangement with the
<br>
World Health Organisation (WHO).
<br>
<p>The incident highlights how easy it could be for some with
<br>
bio-engineering knowledge to create a murderous virus for which there
<br>
would be no cure or effective
<br>
vaccine, New Scientist said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Vast amounts of time and effort have gone into policing the military's
<br>
use of biotechnology. But the activities of civilian biologists have
<br>
been ignored,&quot; it said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Yet genetic engineering techniques are now so widespread that
<br>
potentially dangerous results are bound to emerge accidentally.&quot;
<br>
<p>It suggests tougher vetting of research proposals; a greater effort to
<br>
train students in biological subjects about potential dangers arising
<br>
from lab work; and
<br>
encouraging greater openness among biologists to discuss the misuse of
<br>
genetic engineering.
