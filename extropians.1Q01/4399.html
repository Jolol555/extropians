<p>The story of this in _Surely your Joking, Mr. Feynman_ is great.  He had a
<br>
bunch of high school kids running the machine, and they were, in part, one
<br>
of the reasons we got the bomb done when we did.
<br>
<p>Not that the bomb was necessarily a good thing, but I think this shows one
<br>
of the problems with today's education system:  Kids obviously CAN work to
<br>
very high standards and accomplish a lot, if they are given the opportunity,
<br>
but they are not given it.  They are bored in class, and bored flipping
<br>
burgers.  At least I was, and a lot of smart people I knew were.
<br>
<p>Solve this, and we solve some of the Script Kiddie/&quot;Hacker&quot; virus problems.
