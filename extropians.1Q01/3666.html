<p><em>&gt;  &gt; The majority of human progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; comes from a relative handful of creative and energetic people, not from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the masses of humankind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Depends how you define 'progress'. And on the ability to selectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ignore the necessary prerequisites for those 'creative and energetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people' to do their things. Behind every aerospace engineer or chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  designer there's a small army of people working supermarket checkouts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  farms and food factories (so the engineers don't have to hunt their food
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  every day with a flint spear), valeting maintaining and manufacturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their cars (so the engineers don't have to walk to work every day),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  building houses and mowing their lawns for them, and so on. These people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are not clearly part of the creative process -- but without them, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  couldn't be a creative process because the creative person would be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bloody busy staying alive to get creating.
</em><br>
<p>All true, but . . .
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  From this viewpoint, being creative and innovative is merely a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  specialisation, of no more importance to the running of things than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  being paid to clean toilets for a living.
</em><br>
<p>This doesn't follow at all.  Some kinds of specialization require far more 
<br>
knowledge, training and skill than others.  The more specialized knowledge 
<br>
and skill a particular job requires, the less fungible are the people who 
<br>
perform that work.  From a strictly economic point of view, the jobs 
<br>
requiring more specialized training and skill ARE &quot;more important&quot; - so long 
<br>
as they provide value to others which people are willing to pay for.  With 
<br>
some notable exceptions, work that requires a lot of specialized knowledge 
<br>
and skill tends to be valued - in economic terms - more highly than those 
<br>
that do not have such requirements.  This isn't a question of basic human 
<br>
dignity, but of simple economics.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  I've noticed a tendency of people on this list -- and of libertarians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in general -- to flatter themselves with the idea that they belong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  some tiny elite, buried in the seething masses, who actually make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  things work and civlization progress. Well, it might be true -- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that might be a pig I see through my study window, on final approach 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  into Turnhouse airport. Folks, we *are* those masses. Doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  if most of them are dumb as a plank; we're still related.
</em><br>
<p>You may be right about a tendency of libertarians to consider themselves in 
<br>
the manner you describe.  And as has been pointed out recently in another 
<br>
thread, people tend to over-estimate their intelligence and competence in a 
<br>
negative ratio to the reality of their character and circumstances.  But the 
<br>
truth is that knowledge, talent, energy and skill are not evenly distributed 
<br>
among people.  People with high levels of these characteristics tend to 
<br>
produce value at a higher rate than people who do not.  Again, this is not a 
<br>
matter of human dignity, just the economic reality of life in society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I figure that if you want to set ethical goals for extropians, taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  those dumb-as-a-plank people and helping them learn to *think* would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be a good starting point for activism. Denying that they're *capable*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thought is actually a first step down another road -- one that leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to a hereditary aristocracy or a caste system.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with all of this.  The greatest resource we have is the potential 
<br>
locked up in PEOPLE.  Figuring out how to cultivate and express that resource 
<br>
is the number one priority of any society I want to live in.
