<em>&gt;Thanks, Harvey.  By the way, I've been trying to keep up with the recount,

</em><br>
<p>One site I found which is attempting to cover the issue on an ongoing
<br>
basis is <a href="http://www.voter.com/home/">http://www.voter.com/home/</a>.  Confusingly, <a href="http://www.voter.com/">http://www.voter.com/</a>
<br>
claims that the site is shutting down, but the first address appears to be
<br>
still operational.
<br>
<p>They have a link on their front page (near the bottom) to ongoing coverage
<br>
of the recounts.  Unfortunately many of their links from that story are
<br>
to the Miami Herald, which recently reorganized its website and broke all
<br>
the links to its archives.  The Herald is also charging money to read its
<br>
archived articles so it is not a very convenient source.  However some of
<br>
the links are to non-Herald articles and those still work.
<br>
<p>Hopefully this site will continue to track and update the links as the
<br>
story develops.
