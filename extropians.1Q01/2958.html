Remember the &quot;Trill&quot; from the &quot;star trek&quot; saga.
<br>
<p>The design of a human body which can integrate or over time assimalate numerous
<br>
personalities via fusion of the physical remnants of individuals... their
<br>
brains..is one manner to reduce population while still allowing for procreation.
<br>
Maybe 500 years from now all 10 billion or so (whatever the base number is when
<br>
such a thing becomes possible)  of the original stock might find themselves
<br>
housed in 100 million bodies.  A merger of the borgian and the individual
<br>
concepts.  Meanwhile new births would have the luxury of a single personality per
<br>
body.  Each suceeding lifespan  there would have to be a merger with another
<br>
person.  In a world of married couples perhaps husbands and wives might plan for
<br>
cohabitation in one body.  As time goes on however, the concentration of
<br>
personalities would happen.  There would always be the possible situation where
<br>
an individual wants to terminate their existance and how this might be
<br>
accomplished?  Uploading as has been discussed need not be into a machine but
<br>
instead into a biological host.  I think that once the understanding of
<br>
biological systems allows self-directed evolution this might be one natural way
<br>
to proceed.....
