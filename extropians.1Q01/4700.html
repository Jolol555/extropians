</em><br>
<p>I agree with Mike here. Blavatsky was a mystic. Her view of &quot;posthuman&quot; had 
<br>
nothing to do with what we mean by posthuman. You might as well call 
<br>
Christians and other religious believers posthumans because they believe 
<br>
their essence is not a physical human body but a &quot;pure spirit&quot;. Nietzsche 
<br>
would be a much better example, since he was no mystic. He didn't lay out 
<br>
any technological path to the overman, but did have the right basic idea 
<br>
and certainly didn't rely on supernatural or non-scientific expectations.
<br>
<p>I scanned your Web site and did not see any definition of &quot;posthuman&quot;. I 
<br>
have to assume that you are using some odd meaning of the term utterly at 
<br>
odds with how it's used within transhumanist circles. On the usual meaning, 
<br>
you are most definitely *not* a posthuman. Or do you claim to have made 
<br>
your genes irrelevant to your physical, intellectual, and emotional 
<br>
functioning? Have you overcome the limits of aging and death? Have you 
<br>
reshaped yourself physically, cognitively, and psychologically so that you 
<br>
are no longer remotely human. Obviously the answer is &quot;no&quot;. You may be a 
<br>
*posthumanist*, though I'm not sure what that is, since we have very little 
<br>
clue as what posthumans will be like except in general terms consistent 
<br>
with the limits of physics (insert Jupiter brain speculations here).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;By definition, posthumans will not exist until the singularity occurs,
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with Mike on this one. I'm something of a Singularity 
<br>
skeptic, though it does depend on how the term Singularity is defined. I 
<br>
expect a powerful swell, rather than a sudden spike. At some stage in the 
<br>
swell of accelerating change we may legitimately claim to be posthuman -- 
<br>
having made the control functions of our human genes irrelevant, having 
<br>
re-structured and massively upgraded our cognitive architecture, and having 
<br>
transformed our psychological functioning at multiple levels from the 
<br>
hardware pathways to the high-level &quot;mental&quot; structures.
<br>
<p>Claims to already be posthuman strike me as either being based on an 
<br>
unhelpful definition of the term, or on hyperbole, or possibly on 
<br>
dishonesty aimed at attracting people to a system for becoming a posthuman. 
<br>
I will assume that the first is the case, given your lack of a definition, 
<br>
though you Neo-Tech style hyperbole about MVT makes me wonder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Your &quot;singularity&quot; is a fiction that won't happen ... rather like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;rapture.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What single shred of evidence do you have for it? Who wants to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Borg anyway .... I prefer Dr. Who who fights against would-be daleks!
</em><br>
<p>This shows a lack of knowledge about the idea of the Singularity. As I 
<br>
said, I am not a Singularitarian. But it's obvious if you've looked at the 
<br>
discussions of the issue that Borganism is *not* a necessary component of 
<br>
that view. Some people do foresee becoming group minds, but others who a 
<br>
Singularity ahead instead expect simply far more advanced individuals, and 
<br>
individuals with massively improved interpersonal communications (which 
<br>
doesn't mean they have lost their individuality), and all shades in between.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;After (or post-) human simply indicates whatever identity comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after the &quot;human being&quot; stage of history .... &quot;trans-&quot; human is subset
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the after/post-human identity ... for if we are &quot;transitional&quot; then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are already different from &quot;non-transitional&quot; humans.
</em><br>
<p>No, transhuman is not a subset of posthuman. Transhuman is a transitional 
<br>
stage in which humans begin making peripheral alterations to their natural 
<br>
condition. This started centuries ago with sensory aids (ear trumpets, 
<br>
eyeglasses), and continues with smart drugs, mood-altering drugs, gene 
<br>
therapy, etc. None of these make genes irrelevant; such people are still 
<br>
part of the human race -- they are part of the same gene pool. Some of us 
<br>
have *ideas&quot; that are well outside the norm. That's why we call ourselves 
<br>
transhumanists and/or Extropians. None of us are posthuman. Unless someone 
<br>
here has been uplifted by aliens and isn't telling. :-)
<br>
<p>I also disagree on the utility of general principles (not *rules*), but I 
<br>
think Daniel Ust has responded well on that point.
<br>
<p>What bothers me about your talking about being posthuman is that others 
<br>
will see that and think that it makes no sense, then may also dismiss the 
<br>
more grounded claims of transhumanism. &quot;These people actually think they 
<br>
are a different species. Just another wacko bunch who want to think they 
<br>
are superior to everyone else.&quot;
<br>
<p>Onward!
