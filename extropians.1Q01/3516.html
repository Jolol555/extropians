<p>Harmless by your definition, not mine.  If you ever get a chance to 
<br>
talk to a woman who's been raped, or forcefully groped, ask her if 
<br>
she was physically hurt.  If she wasn't, explain to her that since 
<br>
she wasn't physically harmed that the act of the rape was &quot;harmless&quot;.
<br>
<p>You just don't get it.  When someone does something physically to you 
<br>
against your will, it's a violation of your person.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Look, the whole idea of the pie-in-the-face is that it's meant to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-damaging. If it causes injury, or infection with a nasty strain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gut-rot, then it undermines its own purpose. You might as well ask &quot;why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not embed a hand grenade in the pie?&quot; Answer: because then it wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be an overtly harmless insult any more, and we're back to talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people making political points by shooting at each other.
</em><br>
<p>Microwave the &quot;pie&quot; to cook anything bad.  Someone aggressively 
<br>
trying to shove even a regular pie in your face can also poke you in 
<br>
the eye with a finger or the edge of a pie tin.  Every similar attack 
<br>
has some chance of injuring the victim in some fashion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Can you cope with people mocking you publicly, if they don't lay so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as an air molecule on your person?
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I have no problem with that.  When someone mocks me publicly, 
<br>
they're not impeding me or attacking me physically.  They have a 
<br>
right to mock me.
<br>
<p>By your logic, if someone is mocking me and I don't like it, I should 
<br>
be able to have my bodyguards go shove a pie in his face or do 
<br>
something else equally assaulting and degrading.  Might makes right, 
<br>
huh?
<br>
<p>Maybe if Bill Gates had bodyguards who were bullies in a similar 
<br>
fashion, you'd see the unfairness of the situation and realize that 
<br>
it doesn't matter who the victim is - the act itself of physically 
<br>
humiliating someone is wrong.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
