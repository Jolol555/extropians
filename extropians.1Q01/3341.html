Our time system of 60 seconds, 60 minutes and 24 hours is intimately
<br>
linked with the sciences of navigation and astronomy. While astronomy
<br>
seems to have been practiced by women in many early cultures as part of
<br>
the religion (and by males in others), navigation was a male science, as
<br>
seamanship has always been dominated by males, for either military or
<br>
trade purposes. Astronomers of early cultures were also astrologers, who
<br>
typically divided the heavens up into 12 houses of the zodiac (while the
<br>
names and formations of constellations tended to be unique to the
<br>
particular culture), and from which they evolved their timekeeping
<br>
systems to correspond to the rotation of the earth through the zodiac.
<br>
This correspondence of stellar formations and time systems was of utmost
<br>
importance in navigation, especially maritime navigation where landmarks
<br>
were frequently absent. Because of this correspondence, most all time
<br>
systems evolved from early cultures utilized a mathematical base derived
<br>
from the numbers of constellations in the zodiac of the local culture.
<br>
Thus, a base 12 system found in the standard western zodiac results in
<br>
uses of 24, 36, 48, and 60 unit groups, as well as groups resulting from
<br>
the factors of 12: 2,3,4, and 6. Because 12 as a base is so much more
<br>
versatile than, say, 10, it has been a far more convenient base system
<br>
for navigation, time keeping, and many other uses.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Most all of my black friends (or African Americans if you prefer)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;over quite a lot, as does his parents, friends, etc. And these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;all middle to upper class people.  They just happen to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;wrong skin color.
</em><br>
<p>How about the wrong vehicle color? I've been pulled over more with my
<br>
red Cherokee (with gold trim) than I have with any other car besides an
<br>
old beater I had that looked like a pot-head-mobile.
<br>
<p>Profiling by vehicle is an easy way to get around racial profiling,
<br>
because drug dealers, for example, tend to exhibit a specific sort of
<br>
taste in car decor (crack dealers like gold trim and tinted windows,
<br>
pot-heads like VW's with phish or GD stickers, etc).
