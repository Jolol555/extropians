&gt; Scientists Create First Genetically Modified Primate
&gt; Baby Rhesus Monkey, Nicknamed ANDi, Carries Extra
&gt; DNA 
&gt; 
&gt; By WILLIAM McCALL
&gt; .c The Associated Press
&gt; 
&gt; PORTLAND, Ore. (Jan. 11) - Researchers have created
&gt; the world's first 
&gt; genetically modified primate, a baby rhesus monkey
&gt; whose name - ANDi - stands 
&gt; for ''inserted DNA'' spelled backward.
&gt; 
&gt; Born in October, the male monkey carries a tiny
&gt; extra bit of DNA in a gene 
&gt; introduced as a marker that can be seen under a
&gt; microscope because it glows 
&gt; green, researchers at Oregon Health Sciences
&gt; University said.
&gt; 
&gt; ANDi's creation was described in the Friday issue of
&gt; the journal Science.
&gt; 
&gt; Researchers hope they now can introduce other genes
&gt; in rhesus monkeys that 
&gt; could trigger a host of human diseases such as
&gt; Alzheimer's, diabetes, breast 
&gt; cancer or HIV, allowing experiments to block them at
&gt; the genetic level.
&gt; 
&gt; The technique for inserting the gene has been used
&gt; for more than a quarter 
&gt; century in mice, but comparing a mouse to a human
&gt; being has limits, said Dr. 
&gt; Gerald Schatten. He is leading the research at the
&gt; university's Oregon 
&gt; Regional Primate Center.
&gt; 
&gt; Because monkeys are close genetic cousins to humans,
&gt; they may give scientists 
&gt; a better picture of how human disease develops, he
&gt; said.
&gt; 
&gt; ''I think we're at an extraordinary moment in the
&gt; history of humans,'' 
&gt; Schatten said Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Others were quick to condemn the research.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Ray Greek, spokesman for the Physicians
&gt; Committee for Responsible 
&gt; Medicine, said the disease research can be already
&gt; done at the cellular level.
&gt; 
&gt; ''I think it's going to get them a lot of press and
&gt; will eventually translate 
&gt; into getting OHSU a lot of money,'' Greek said.
&gt; 
&gt; ''But 20 years from now, will your children be safer
&gt; from cancer, heart 
&gt; disease, etc., as a result of this? The odds are
&gt; astronomically against it.''
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Phyllis Leppert at the National Institutes of
&gt; Health, which funded the 
&gt; research, defended the monkey gene modification.
&gt; 
&gt; She said the NIH and scientists have been dealing
&gt; with genetic research 
&gt; issues for decades, and Schatten - like other
&gt; scientists who work with 
&gt; primates - are always trying to balance the use of
&gt; animals with the prospect 
&gt; of curing a disease.
&gt; 
&gt; ''All of this research is being done very carefully
&gt; with all of the 
&gt; scientific community giving him input,'' Leppert
&gt; said.
&gt; 
&gt; Schatten said the modification should help
&gt; researchers find cures for human 
&gt; diseases faster, eventually ending the need to use
&gt; animals.
&gt; 
&gt; He also said the technique will limit the number of
&gt; monkeys needed because 
&gt; test animals can be genetically designed,
&gt; eliminating the need to create a 
&gt; large pool of test animals in hopes that one will
&gt; have the desired 
&gt; characteristics.
&gt; 
&gt; ''Researchers around the world believe that a lot of
&gt; diseases like cancers, 
&gt; like mental illnesses, like diabetes and other
&gt; degenerative diseases could 
&gt; actually be cured, and cured within just a few
&gt; years,'' Schatten said.
&gt; 
&gt; ''I don't think any of us would want to make
&gt; primates sick unless it would 
&gt; truly accelerate the day that diseases can be
&gt; eradicated.''
&gt; 
&gt; A year ago, Schatten reported the first monkey
&gt; successfully cloned by embryo 
&gt; splitting. That monkey is named Tetra. ANDi and his
&gt; surrogate mother, as well 
&gt; as Tetra, remain healthy, Schatten said.
&gt; 
&gt; ANDi received an extra gene while he was still an
&gt; unfertilized egg.
&gt; 
&gt; Schatten, lead author Anthony W.S. Chan and other
&gt; researchers modified and 
&gt; then fertilized more than 200 rhesus monkey eggs.
&gt; Forty embryos were 
&gt; produced, and resulted in five pregnancies and three
&gt; live births. Of the 
&gt; three baby monkeys, only ANDi proved to have the
&gt; modified genes.
&gt; 
&gt; Greek, an author and physician, remained skeptical.
&gt; 
&gt; ''We have been doing to mice for 20 to 30 years what
&gt; they have done with 
&gt; ANDi,'' he said, ''and we have been singularly
&gt; unsuccessful, especially in 
&gt; cancer research.''
&gt; 
&gt; Terry Lomax, an Oregon State University plant
&gt; geneticist who has dealt with 
&gt; similar issues over genetically modified food, said
&gt; the issue is going to 
&gt; keep getting more attention.
&gt; 
&gt; ''But I think people will be a little more fearful
&gt; because monkeys are a 
&gt; little closer to home,'' she said. ''That's why it's
&gt; good to have a public 
&gt; dialogue.''
