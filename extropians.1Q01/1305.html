One comment on what Chris wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; Reason Magazin has a couple of articles highlighting all the non-market

<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markets, in which the highest price paid all day 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is charged for all contracts that day
</em><br>
<p>This pricing rule sounds stupid, but I want to defend it, or at least
<br>
explain why it is not as absurd as it sounds.
<br>
<p>First, one of the Berkeley papers I pointed to earlier makes the point
<br>
that it is entirely common in commodity markets to pay the same price
<br>
for all supplies of the commodity.  This happens even when it costs more
<br>
to supply some of the commodity than others.  For example, with pork
<br>
bellies the transportation costs will vary depending on where the pork
<br>
comes from.  But you don't pay one price for the lot from California and
<br>
a different price for the lot from New York.  One price is paid for all.
<br>
This policy simplifies the bidding process and futures contracts.
<br>
<p>If we accept this general principle, then in the case of the electricity
<br>
market there remain two questions.  First, is it reasonable to use the
<br>
same price for all the electricity delivered during the day, given that
<br>
supply and demand fluctuate during the day?  And second, if we are going
<br>
to do this, should we use the highest-price rule (also called first-price
<br>
auction rules).
<br>
<p>I think the justification for using the same price all day is twofold.
<br>
First, given how the market works, demand is almost completely insensitive
<br>
to price.  Inter-day price variations aren't passed on to customers,
<br>
so they do not adjust their demand in response.  Therefore there is less
<br>
advantage than in some markets to adjusting the price on an hour by hour
<br>
basis since it will not affect demand.
<br>
<p>Secondly, this might actually reduce some of the opportunities for
<br>
&quot;gaming&quot; the system (using strategies to achieve higher than competitive
<br>
rates).  If they actually got their hour-by-hour prices, companies which
<br>
knew that electricity was going to be worth more in the afternoon than
<br>
in the morning would hold their electricity off the market until then.
<br>
If you were selling a product that would be worth three times more at 4
<br>
PM than at 10 AM, wouldn't you do the same?  By giving the sellers the
<br>
same price all day it eliminates this kind of manipulation.
<br>
<p>Now we come to the question of first-price auctioning, that is, using
<br>
the highest price rather than the average price or some other rule.
<br>
The justification for first-price auctions is, again, that it tends to
<br>
reduce some forms of gaming and manipulation.  Without this kind of rule
<br>
companies have to second-guess what other suppliers are going to ask.
<br>
They want to set their price as high as possible, but not substantially
<br>
higher than everyone else.  This involves guessing and invites collusion.
<br>
With a simple auction rule like first-price auctioning there is less of
<br>
this kind of gamesmanship.
<br>
<p>Besides, if we changed the rules it would not necessarily save money.
<br>
The prices we are paying ultimately are due to the fact that demand is
<br>
coming up against the limits of supply.  Changes to the market rules
<br>
won't change this fundamental fact.
<br>
<p>Imagine that eBay, the online auctioner, adopted a rule to &quot;save money
<br>
to buyers&quot;.  Whatever price an auction closed at, the buyer only had to
<br>
pay HALF that price to the seller.  So if an item sold for $100, the
<br>
buyer would only have to pay $50.  It should be clear that this would
<br>
not actually save any significant amount to buyers.  Items would simply
<br>
sell for twice what they do now, so that the actual amount paid would be
<br>
the same.  The real prices are set by supply and demand and the auction
<br>
rules have a relatively minor effect.
<br>
<p>Similarly, suppose we changed from a highest-price rule to an
<br>
average-price rule.  We think this will save money for the buyers by
<br>
making the sellers accept less.  But this won't necessarily happen.
<br>
Instead, average prices will go up because sellers know that they
<br>
aren't going to get their afternoon prices.  They have to charge more
<br>
in the morning to compensate.  This price adjustment will undercut the
<br>
hoped-for effects in changing the rule.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying market rules have no effects, but rather that the effects
<br>
are more subtle than may appear at first glance.  Superficial changes
<br>
which are supposed to lower prices may not have that result.  You have
<br>
to look at the details of how markets work in order to choose the best
<br>
rules.  And in many cases rules like first-price auctions work as well
<br>
as any others.
<br>
