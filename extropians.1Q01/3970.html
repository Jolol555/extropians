<p>You're not the only person to point this out. A Burlington, VT school
<br>
principal got in hot water recently with parents and the local dairy
<br>
industry when she caved into the demand of ONE PETA member demanding
<br>
equal space to put posters next to the 'Got Milk?' posters that detailed
<br>
all the alleged health problems associated with milk consumption (while
<br>
curiously not mentioning all of the health problems associated with lack
<br>
of dairy consumption). Rather than put up the PETA posters, the school
<br>
board originally decided to take all the posters down, then the Governor
<br>
got into the act, who told PETA to stuff it.
<br>
<p>PETA is for the genocide of domesticated animals of all kinds
<br>
(individual members may not take it that far, but that is the party
<br>
line).
