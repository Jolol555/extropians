You sit there and just marvel at
<br>
the idea that this was once cutting-edge; that people could think of the
<br>
movie as being anything but homey, wholesome, and relaxing.  You do it for
<br>
the historical value and to just appreciate how different things must have
<br>
been a couple of generations ago.  If 2001 were released today, it would
<br>
flop.  How can you demand of my generation that they watch it?
<br>

<p>Gen-Xer's can certainly enjoy watching 2001 and not feel bored to death!  I think you underestimate them...  If anything the previous generations would have had a harder time both enjoying and understanding the film.  
<br>
<p>I think if 2001 were released today it might have a rough time of it initially, but support for it would grow.  And you know how a big budget advertising campaign would be in order... lol   
<br>
<p>I still feel this film comes across in many ways as cutting edge.  The special effects still hold up magnificiently and actually outdo the computer animation I so often see in films today. 
<br>
<p>And even for people now, 2001 is hardly mundane and homey.  There is a powerful sense of awe about humanity's future and our relationship with the rest of the universe which hits me everytime I see the film.  Star Trek makes me think homey and wholesome, never 2001. 
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
