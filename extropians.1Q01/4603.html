<em>&gt; No political theory is completely correct ... and all are formed out

</em><br>
<p>This can be said about any theory or idea.  You seem to be assuming either
<br>
knowledge is final and perfect or it's totally unacceptable.  Why science?
<br>
Why technology?  Why case-by-case rejection?  Why anything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;By what means does one &quot;to judge issues on a case-by-case, situationalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(posthuman aesthetic) way?&quot;  That would seem to mean to me an implicit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;tacit political philosophy as opposed to an explicit one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The latter is easier to examine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fossils are easy to examine, this is true.
</em><br>
<p>Just because something isn't explicated, doesn't mean it's alive and
<br>
thriving.  I tend to think that making assumptions visible and tacit
<br>
knowledge more verbal, one is better able to examine it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;(Also, I think such &quot;case-by-case&quot; thinking is just how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the average person and politician approaches matters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course it must be ..... politicians in practice find they cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stick to their cumbersome political theories.
</em><br>
<p>I think what is more likely is they find their rhetoric prevents their
<br>
desire for more power or to get along from coming to fruition.  The same
<br>
applies to nonpoliticians.  Being able to ignore principles gives one an
<br>
easy out when they become a nuisance to getting along with other people or
<br>
avoid a bad conscience.  It's easy to say, &quot;Stealing is wrong&quot; and then when
<br>
one takes home office supplies from work justifying that as not really
<br>
stealing and pointing out how we must judge each theft on a case-by-case
<br>
basis before deciding if it's truly theft.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This is how we get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people who say they are for freedom of expression, but against expression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they or well established find offensive, such as people who against
</em><br>
anyone
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;making anti-Christian art.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure what you mean here, but certainly, a priori offence at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art is a 'political' theory rather than a case-by-case aesthetic
</em><br>
judgement.
<br>
<p>I don't think of this as a &quot;'political' theory.&quot;  Perhaps a definition is in
<br>
order here.  What do you mean by political theory?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Principles or guide-lines are &quot;soft rules&quot; as opposed to &quot;hard rules&quot;,
</em><br>
sure.
<br>
<p>I think it's a little deeper than that, but I don't want to travel down the
<br>
path of Objectivist first principles or the wider Objectivist view of
<br>
principled thought and action.  Others already have explicated those points
<br>
anyhow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have deliberately never tried to compile any &quot;Posthuman Principles&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though because I *do* distrust (or rather, see little point in) UNIVERSAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catch-all linguistic formulations that are independent of any empirical
</em><br>
test
<br>
<em>&gt; or evidence.
</em><br>
<p>But isn't that a rule in action above?  You seem to be using as your rule
<br>
&quot;empirical test[s] or evidence&quot; as your touchstone, so you are not really
<br>
throwing out theory, just saying you are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose it is inevitable that we make up Posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *suggestions* from time to time, but maybe shouldn't try to pretend that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such suggestions are immune from change and somehow true for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time or permanent .. that would be self-defeating for a radical futurist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agenda! And if the extropian principles are updated every year, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they cannot be very principled principles anyway ... far too short term ..
</em><br>
<p>I don't pretend to defend the Extropian Principles.  Nor do I think one
<br>
should collapse them or other transhumanist writings into principles in
<br>
general.  This would be an overgeneralization.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
