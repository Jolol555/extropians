One of the interesting things I learned from the articles I've read
<br>
about the TED conferences is that Wurman doesn't pay any speaking
<br>
fees, even though many of the speakers could command $30,000 -
<br>
$50,000/event, and even though Wurman himself charges $3 - $4
<br>
K/ticket.
<br>
<p>Wurman's able to get free speakers (except for hotel and food) because
<br>
a) of his own persistence and chutzpah b) the speakers want to attend
<br>
to meet the other people who will be there.
<br>
<p>This suggests that one possible way to attract stellar speakers to
<br>
Extro, yet keep costs down:
<br>
<p>Ask each potential speaker to name 3-4 people that they would really
<br>
like to meet--that they would like to meet so much, in fact, that the
<br>
speaker would be willing to forgo their normal speaking fees if you
<br>
got any one of them to attend Extro.  Then go after one of those 3-4
<br>
people.  Perhaps try the same thing for attendees.
<br>
<p>Another idea:
<br>
<p>Put the principle of social proof to work.  (See Steve's Primer of
<br>
Practical Persuasion and Influence at
<br>
<a href="http://www.as.wvu.edu/~sbb/comm221/primer.htm">http://www.as.wvu.edu/~sbb/comm221/primer.htm</a>) Ask attendee's to give
<br>
a short biography describing their accomplishments, and a photograph.
<br>
Put them up on the Extro conference sign up page so potential
<br>
attendees can see who they will have the opportunity to meet if they
<br>
decide to attend.  Same thing for Extropy members
<br>
