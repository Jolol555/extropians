</em><br>
<p>That's *right*.  An AI, even a Friendly AI, feels no obligation because
<br>
*we* wrote the source code.  Not unless someone puts it there, and while
<br>
there will someday be AIs that are good drinking companions and fit
<br>
participants in the human drama, and these AIs may wax sentimental about
<br>
their creators, the Friendly AIs come *first* - the Sysop, or the
<br>
Guardians.
<br>
<p>An AI can be Friendly because there's nothing there except what you put
<br>
there, what you share with the AI.  The task is nontrivial because you
<br>
don't always know what it is you're putting there, but that blank slate,
<br>
that vast silent space, is what makes the task possible.
<br>
<p>I don't want to sound like it's a question of coercion.  The paradigm of
<br>
Friendly AI is to create unity between the will of the Friendly AI and the
<br>
decisions of an idealized human altruist.  It is not a question of
<br>
control.  You have to identify with the Friendly AI you build, because a
<br>
human thinks about controlling different humans, wheedling or coercing the
<br>
Other, but the only time we *build* a mind is when we build ourselves. 
<br>
The Friendly AI I want to build is the same being I would make myself into
<br>
if that were only way to get a Sysop (a Guardian AI, if you prefer).  A
<br>
Sysop might not turn out to be a real person, and I'd back myself up first
<br>
if I could - but a Sysop is a valid thing for a mind to be, a valid state
<br>
for a mind to occupy, a valid part of the world, not a slave or someone
<br>
we've tricked into servitude.
<br>
<p>You keep trying to understand AI in human terms.  Everything that you use
<br>
to model other minds is specialized on understanding humans, and an AI
<br>
isn't human.  A Friendly AI isn't Friendly to us because *we* built it; it
<br>
would be just as Friendly if the identical source code materialized from
<br>
thin air, and will go on to be just as Friendly to aliens if a
<br>
pre-Singularity civilization is ever found orbiting another star.  That
<br>
lack of sentiment doesn't make it dangerous.  My benevolence towards other
<br>
sentient beings isn't conditional on their having created me; why would I
<br>
want to build a conditionally Friendly AI?
