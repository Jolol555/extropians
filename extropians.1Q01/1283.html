</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not even that.  Do you think because someone has a high intelligence or the
<br>
esteem of his peers that this is the best we can do?  That's not so.  The
<br>
best we can do is try to following the reasoning and see if it is sound and
<br>
see if it fits the evidence.  This is why I value transparency in argument
<br>
and science.  (One great thing about cladistics, peer review, open debate is
<br>
that all place a premium on transparency.)  Arguing from authority is akin
<br>
to arguing from a black box.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what, other than his hard-won reputation and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; esteem of his critical peers (emblematized in his Oxford chair), impels
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; to prefer to listen to Hawking's views over those of some random claimant?
</em><br>
<p>Past performance.  I admit that.  However, I don't think this is any
<br>
guarantee of future success.  At no point am I willing to substitute
<br>
Hawking's judgment for my own.  Once I do that, I would no longer be
<br>
thinking.  He would be thinking, I would merely be parroting.  And
<br>
parroting, no matter who true the original statements are, is still
<br>
parroting.  A bird saying &quot;The sky is blue&quot; knows little about the color of
<br>
the sky.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (True, I hope that you would only endorse them, should you do so after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careful scrutiny, in the extent to which you *did* find them really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convincing and morish, in their own terms; but I really really doubt
</em><br>
that's
<br>
<em>&gt; why you read them by preference to, say, the latest aether theory on the
</em><br>
web.)
<br>
<p>Actually, I don't have time to read all the latest physical theories on the
<br>
web.  This is one reason I generally stick to mathematics.  Less crackpots
<br>
and they're easier to spot.:)
<br>
