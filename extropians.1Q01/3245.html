</em><br>
<em>&gt; So how can any interaction with a &quot;public servant&quot; in their official
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Under the Privacy Act of 1974, a private citizen has the right to expect
<br>
that government held information about them of many kinds is not made
<br>
public. Punishment for a government person violating this is a ten year
<br>
prison sentence and/or a $20,000 fine. That private individual does have
<br>
the right to disclose whatever information they want publicly, but
<br>
governments have been trying to turn the use of this law around to
<br>
restrain private citizens from disclosing information about abusive
<br>
interactions with government officials, and ignores the prosecution of
<br>
officials that violate it. Example: Pentagon disclosures of Linda
<br>
Tripp's personnel files in order to asassinate her character in the
<br>
Lewinsky scandal. I've seen enlistees get sent to Leavenworth Prison for
<br>
ten years for forgetting to put away a personnel file, yet high ranking
<br>
officials never get busted on this when done for political purposes.
<br>
Filegate, for example, has given the DNC gigabytes of dirt on hundreds
<br>
of high ranking GOP officials and private party contributors.
