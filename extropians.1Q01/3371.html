Future announces strategic investment  in TED conferences
<br>
<p>Future acquires 49% shareholding
<br>
<p>Future Network plc (LSE: FNET), the international specialist consumer
<br>
magazine and online publisher, today announces that it has entered
<br>
into a strategic partnership agreement with TED Conferences LLC, a US
<br>
company that runs one of the world?s most successful and innovative
<br>
conferences, TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design).
<br>
<p>This agreement will see Future investing US$8 million to acquire a 49%
<br>
shareholding in TED Conferences LLC, of which US$6 million will be
<br>
paid in cash, with the remaining US$2 million paid through the issue
<br>
of 158,228 new ordinary shares in Future. These shares are to be
<br>
retained for at least 12 months. Future has agreed to acquire the
<br>
remaining 51 per cent interest within three years of the date of the
<br>
agreement for a maximum consideration of US$12 million. TED
<br>
Conferences founder and director, Richard Saul Wurman, will remain
<br>
with the business and will continue to exercise management and
<br>
creative control of the conferences.

<p>The 2000 conference (TED10) was held in Monterey in February this year
<br>
and attracted more than 800 registrants.  Revenues were approximately
<br>
US$3 million, of which 80 per cent came from registrations and the
<br>
remainder from sponsorships. Earnings before interest and tax were
