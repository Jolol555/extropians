<p>
At one point I too was very much into the concept of arcologies - if nothing
<br>
else they were an incredibly efficient use of space and could help curb
<br>
some of the major problems facing urban centers today (sprawl, pollution
<br>
of all kinds, etc.)  However, it's fairly clear that such a project is 
<br>
nearly impossible in the current sociopolitical and economic climate. 
<br>
<p>However, consider the following:  AN arcology is supposed to be self-contained,
<br>
with relatively low inputs and almost no waste outputs.  One of the cardinal
<br>
ideas is effeciency in the use of space, effectively utilizing three dimensions
<br>
instead of just two as most of today's day-to-day architecture does.  Another
<br>
is the notion of &quot;centralized&quot; recycling (i.e. recycling done on premises, 
<br>
rather than being shipped out to a landfill or to a remote recycling facility,
<br>
as opposed to the usual meaning of the phrase &quot;centralized&quot; tends to spark 
<br>
around here).  Habitation for a large number of people, between 30,000 and
<br>
500,000, is built into the concepts of most of the pre-designed arcologies as
<br>
well, allowing for a large support population.
<br>
<p>Now, consider space habitation, both in hostile gravity-well environments or
<br>
free-floating structures in orbit around some planetary or larger class 
<br>
object.  Many of the same principles involved in arcologies are also present
<br>
in most of these larger environments, from the need to conserve space and 
<br>
resources to the need to support a fairly large population.  Certain 
<br>
efficiencies of materials and production can be derived from planning for 
<br>
arcology scale constructions that aren't really realizable here on Earth - 
<br>
for example, providing for large-scale air circulation, dense radiation 
<br>
shielding over a more limited surface area, and conservation og artificial 
<br>
gravity (if necessary).
<br>
<p>It would seem at first blush that pursing arcologies at all would be doomed
<br>
to some kind of failure.  As a traditional urban planning technique, this is
<br>
indeed the case; however using them to assist in planning non-terrestrial
<br>
habitation would give a large number of benefits.  In addition to providing
<br>
a testbed for social and industrial models in a space-based habitation, it
<br>
would als be useful in extending habitation here on earth into more hostile
<br>
environments, such as underwater (where, if you're outside the 21 mile limit,
<br>
you might be able to do something somewhat similar to the Oceania (sp?) 
<br>
project (now defunct, I believe?) and possibly declare as an independent
<br>
nation)
