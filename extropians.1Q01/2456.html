</em><br>
<p>If you carefully spell out the logic of your position and I
<br>
disagree then what other choice do I have but to think your
<br>
logic is flawed?  If I think I have identified the flaws in
<br>
your logic, shouldn't I point them out?  And if you deny my
<br>
allegations, aren't you just being arrogant?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me know if anybody has any insights on this problem or
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think one major insight is: generally, both parties feel the
<br>
same way.  I don't think it's a case of one person pigeon-
<br>
holing the other - it's more like argument entropy: You slowly
<br>
pigeon-hole each other until you end up arguing with yourself.
<br>
(I'll admit that, personally, I sometimes find bits and pieces
<br>
of another person's argument that I find compelling and attack
<br>
those rather than what the person is saying.  So, in effect, I
<br>
end up arguing with the wrong person.)
<br>
<p>Take your own post for example: You probably just saw an
<br>
example of an argument that reminded you of this phenomenon
<br>
and compelled you to post about the general case.  However, it
<br>
could quite easily be taken as an attack on those defending
<br>
Microsoft, who, upon reading this, might think you're accusing
<br>
them of using rather underhanded debate tactics.  In other
<br>
words, your own email could be seen - from one point of view -
<br>
as pigeon-holing your opponents.  (For example, your first
<br>
paragraph was spent defining the tactics of &quot;them&quot; and by
<br>
quoting Samantha - who in turn mentions &quot;Eugene and others&quot; -
<br>
you have effectively defined &quot;us&quot;.)
