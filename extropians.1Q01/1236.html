<em>&gt;From: John Marlow &lt;<a href="mailto:johnmarrek@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20&quot;God%20Does%20Not%20Play%20Dice...&quot;%20--was%20Re:%20That%20idiot%20Darwin&In-Reply-To=&lt;F175lKy8VBDUfdfdhNz0000aba1@hotmail.com&gt;">johnmarrek@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**I am aware of this. Try this: Where I use the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;coincidence,&quot; substitute &quot;random chance.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Is it correct semantics to use phrases/words like &quot;random chance&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;coincidence&quot; to describe situations where an expected effect comes from a 
<br>
cause?
<br>
If I flip a coin 10 times in a row and it comes up heads each time, I might 
<br>
call it a coincidence, because there's other ways it could have come up and 
<br>
this sequence is very unlikely, but since there was (presumably) no foreign 
<br>
event causing it and it is no different from every other coin toss, it's 
<br>
called a coincidence.
<br>
But is it a coincidence that when lightning strikes a tree it catches on 
<br>
fire? &quot;Of all the things that could have happened to the tree when lightning 
<br>
struck - it could have turned to cheese, it could have began dancing - but 
<br>
no, it caught on fire, and trees do this every single time they are hit by 
<br>
lightning, is it a coincidence or is there some higher force at play?&quot;. 
<br>
Someone who says this does not understand cause and effect. And someone who 
<br>
tries to describe evolution as a series of random chance events co-occurring 
<br>
does not understand the theory behind evolution. Early Greek postulations 
<br>
about humans evolving from lower animals was a theory of &quot;random chance&quot; and 
<br>
that's why it never took hold. Darwin described for the first time how it 
<br>
could happen in a cause-and-effect deterministic way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**Next time you see that Darwin guy, you ask him from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me: How does your theory account for the creation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the whole shebang? The starting kickoff?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Same way that economics accounts for the existence of the top quark - it 
<br>
doesn't address it. It's not in its field of study.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;**Even assuming the theory accounts for the appearance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of life and all evolution since--the problem still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remains: order and increasing levels of apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-organizing order was/were set into motion, flying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the face of entropy--or of nothingness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is a problem of physics, not biology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**Einstein, however, made frequent reference to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;God.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So have many other atheists, whether in metaphorical usage (as in your 
<br>
examples below) or in criticizing the idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;I want to know God's thoughts, the rest are details.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--Albert Einstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have 
<br>
expressed it clearly.&quot;
<br>
--Albert Einstein
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;**And, of course, in referene to our little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**&quot;God does not play dice with the universe.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Take it up with him.
