What state would driving around like that be a problem in?  In Mississippi
<br>
and most places in the deep south, seeing very  camoflaged(sp?) people
<br>
driving around very heavily armed in pickups with NRA stickers just means
<br>
it's hunting season.  Having grown up in the deep south, I know of no
<br>
instance of hunters (or anyone really) being harrased for driving around
<br>
like this (other than poachers, spotlighters, baiters, etc).  You're more
<br>
likely to be harassed if you're NOT driving like this during hunting season.
<br>
<p>It is still very acceptable and *expected* in most rural areas in the deep
<br>
south that young boys (and occaisionaly girls) will be taught to hunt and to
<br>
shoot pistols, rifles and shotguns.  Drive into any small rural town in the
<br>
deep south during hunting season (late fall and winter) and you'll find that
<br>
the majority of the male population is heavily armed.  Of course, driving
<br>
around like this with Ohio or New Jersey license tags would probably incur
<br>
the wrath of pretty much everyone, cops and hunters included.  Damn Yankees!
<br>
;)

<em>&gt; It's well known that the FBI has issued &quot;guidelines&quot; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police that state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that pick-up trucks are an indicator of extremist group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; membership. Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious, gun, or Constitutional stickers are to be treated as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indication that the driver is possibly armed and dangerous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God help you if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are also wearing camo at the time...
