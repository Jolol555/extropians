<em>&gt; &gt; Why the shift?  Well, mainly:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1)  Instead of visualizing the Singularity as a far-off celebration on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; day that the whole human race gets together and networks our computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power to build the seed AI that is the final culmination of all our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accumulated programming expertise and augmented intelligence, I figured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out how to build the darn thing myself on a Beowulf network.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The other reasons, in no particular order:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  Where is this writeen up?  Where are the project development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plans? Where is the funding and staffing plan?  I don't mean to pick on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you but I am hearing extravangant (imho) claims for one of the grandest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects of all time but I am not seeing or hearing about much real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substance.  Where is the beef?
</em><br>
<p>I said I thought I knew how to do it.  I didn't say I had written it down,
<br>
produced an architectural sketch and incremental developmental pathway,
<br>
obtained funding, hired a group of highly intelligent engineers, and
<br>
started work.  It takes *time* to do all that.  I'm certainly a heck of a
<br>
lot visibly closer to &quot;first line of code&quot; than I was a couple of years
<br>
back - compare CaTAI 2 with CaTAI 1.0; or compare &quot;Time and Linearity&quot; in
<br>
CaTAI 2.2 with the earlier sections.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2)  I figured out that human cognition actually uses all that parallelized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power mainly for performing operations in one neural &quot;step&quot; that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intrinsically serial - in other words, the brain needs a massive amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power because the transistors run at 200hz.  You'd need a massive amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of parallel power to run a spreadsheet if it ran on a 200hz CPU.  So my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; estimate of the real computing power required to get human-equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence got stepped down by three or four orders of magnitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well that's an interesting theory.  Please point to a write-up and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence and hopefully some peer-review.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, if you think it's a good idea, write it up and send it in to your
<br>
local journal.  I'm not making a career out of that argument, any more
<br>
than I made a career out of the 10^17 ops/sec @ 2025 estimate for human
<br>
equivalence.  I just have the responsibility of picking what seems like
<br>
the best argument and making my best guess using it, whether peer-reviewed
<br>
or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So exactly what is being done to produce the SI beyond the papers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such?  How do people get involved if interested and possessing needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talents or desiring to invest?
</em><br>
<p>Events occur in the following sequence:
<br>
<p>1)   We receive tax-exempt status from the IRS.
<br>
2)   The AI project is put into initiable form (i.e., design moved down to
<br>
a level low enough that highly intelligent engineers can start work on
<br>
it.  See previous comment about comparing &quot;Time and Linearity&quot; versus
<br>
&quot;CaTAI 1.0&quot;.)
<br>
3a)  We obtain funding (private foundations or individuals) to hire some
<br>
number of highly intelligent engineers;
<br>
3b)  We find highly intelligent engineers who are willing to be hired;
<br>
4)   Engineers are hired and work starts.
