<p>OK, makes sense to me. Climate as an economic tug-o-war. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact is that there are proposals to seed the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective way to sequester the huge amounts of carbon that some claim we

</em><br>
<em>&gt; proponents, so it seems to me that they really don't have an interest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solving the problem.
</em><br>
<p>As I mentioned above, I'm reading the terraforming book which has some
<br>
older data on this. I also read the review of the issue in last week's
<br>
nature (Earth systems engineering and management by Stephen
<br>
H. Schneider, Nature Vol 409, 18 January 2001). Schneider gives some
<br>
reasons geoengineering has not been pursued in recent climate debate;
<br>
I think most of them are wrong on one level or another but
<br>
geoengineering doesn't seem to have been deliberately ignored. Rather,
<br>
it has been seen as too risky, distracting from anti-pollution
<br>
initiatives, possibly unethical and not possible to implement due to
<br>
unreliable governance. Beside the purely practical points efforts like
<br>
this runs into the divide between what Fogg calls the ecocentric and
<br>
technocentric approaches to planetary management; in addition both
<br>
approaches often fall into the pitfall of outdoing each other in
<br>
centralist technocracy. I think we can do much better in our own
<br>
environmental thinking. 
<br>
<p>I disagree with your view that greens dislike geoengineering because
<br>
it would leave them without anything to complain of and enlarged
<br>
environment programs would benefit them. If you actually discuss with
<br>
them you realise they think it is morally wrong, infeasible or too
<br>
dangerous. The same with most people against breeder reactors - they
<br>
are simply afraid of the evil nuclear power or the links to weapons
<br>
production. We might disagree with these sentiments, but assuming your
<br>
opponents doesn't even believe their own arguments is a dangerous kind
<br>
of underestimation. A bit of self-serving thinking is of course always
<br>
present, but assuming this is the main source of passion of most of
<br>
one's opponents is a mistake.
