<em>&gt; Charlie Stross asks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you disagree with any of these memes, could you wave a hand and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explain why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm going to be a bit nitpicky here, because these are complex issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and seldom will a one-liner be completely true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Forcing our fellow human beings to live their lives as we see fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    is unethical. (Persuading them of the error of their ways so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    they _choose_ to live their lives by our lights is another matter.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. Initiating violence against someone is wrong; self-defense is right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These two contradict each other.  If someone wants to live their life in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a way as to commit violence, and we make them stop, we are forcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to live their lives as we see fit.  We don't just try to persuade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them not to be violent, to help them see the error of their ways.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make them stop.
</em><br>
<p>Hal, the initial use of force was by the other person, so they committed
<br>
the first unethical act, so therefore force against that act is
<br>
justified, and there is no conflict.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, it is often difficult to distinguish what constitutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiation of violence from what is self-defense.  It is common in human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relations to see a gradual escalation of hostility between two sides.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Each side claims that they are responding in self-defense to the violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiated by the other.  In practice, each is guilty of a degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escalation.  But no one act in the chain can easily be singled out as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the initiation of violence.
</em><br>
<p>There is always a point where the Rubicon is crossed.
<br>
One party may rationalize that its actions were not force, but that is
<br>
for a jury to decide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3. The scientific method provides a better way of evaluating reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    than any religious dogma.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True for today's religions, but not necessarily true in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If God (or AI) came into existence and laid down His transcendental laws,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these might be a superior guide to the truth than the laborious task of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific investigation.
</em><br>
<p>Oh please.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4. Progress (increases in human intelligence, longevity, wealth, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    happiness) is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes; unfortunately reductions in these measures are also possible.
</em><br>
<p>yes, but are they 'good'?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5. Central control is usually less efficient than distributed control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It depends on the situation, the transaction costs, the distribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of information, etc.  We see firms under centralized control competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with each other in a decentralized market.  There is a large body of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics literature that analyzes when centralized vs decentralized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches are more efficient.
</em><br>
<p>These all, however, tend to base their opinion of 'efficiency' from the
<br>
firm or economy's point of view. The proper point of view is the
<br>
individual. It may be efficient for a firm to whip its employees to
<br>
exhaustion. It is not efficient for the employee to work for such a
<br>
firm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 6. Empowering people to learn, work, and transcend their limits is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Empowering&quot; is a somewhat vague and loaded term.  It will not usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be possible to &quot;empower&quot; someone without costs.  These costs must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balanced against the gains.  For example, maybe it would be nice if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone would &quot;empower&quot; me to go back to school for more education.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fine, but who will support my family then?  And will the costs of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absence of my productive efforts in society be less than the benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which my empowerment brings?
</em><br>
<p>Unless you are going to study something like philosophy or theology, I
<br>
don't think its possible for you to not be of benefit to society to do
<br>
so.
