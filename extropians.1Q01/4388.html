<p>Thanks, Greg.  That was educational, as always.  The only thing I 
<br>
would point out is that &quot;before they cause unnecessary costs&quot; is 
<br>
about one US penny, as far as I'm concerned.
<br>
<p>I don't see why non-initiation of force shouldn't apply to legal 
<br>
force as well as physical force.
<br>
<p>Once again, Jeff Davis is within his legal rights to initiate a 
<br>
lawsuit that will certainly be thrown out in the early stages of the 
<br>
trial (ie a frivolous lawsuit).  By my reasoning, however, doing so 
<br>
is unethical.
<br>
<p>Regards,
