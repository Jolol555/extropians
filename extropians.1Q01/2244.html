READ BEFORE PROCEEDING:  I am not and have never been a Microsoft employee.
<br>
I am not in love with Microsoft nor am I Bill's bitch.  Similarly, I have no
<br>
ill feelings towards Unix/Linux/Other alternatives other than a strong
<br>
dislike for the actor portraying Larry Ellison...
<br>
<p>This is relevant because I feel that the seething hate that Mr Leitl and
<br>
other have directed toward Microsoft is somewhat irrational...

<em>&gt; He throws his money around indiscriminately, or, worse, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which help MS.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Let's see... from the gatesfoundation.org website
<br>
<p>$1,000,000 over 12 months to provide capital grants and operating funds to
<br>
King County nonprofit health and human service agencies.
<br>
<p>$10,000,000 over 5 years to create small high schools and redesign existing
<br>
large high schools with special focus on the lowest performing high schools
<br>
in New York City.
<br>
<p>$2,000,000 over 12 months to support the &quot;Moving Women and Families Forward&quot;
<br>
Campaign.
<br>
<p>$10,000 over 12 months to support the Odessa Brown Children's Clinic serving
<br>
children and adolescents in Central and Southeast Seattle.
<br>
<p>$5,100,000 over 2 years to provide superintendents and principals from
<br>
public and private schools access to quality leadership development focused
<br>
on whole systems change.
<br>
<p>Oh no!!! It's EVIL!!!! Evil I tell you!!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Apart from that, the amount of damage the man and company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have inflicted upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world is unfixable in any amount of $$$s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IBM/Intel/Microsoft working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together have created a reality which is rather far from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being optimal. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judge them, you're comparing merely stuff which currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists, and not seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the alternative branches which would now exist if not for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions, which can be traced back to the year 1978.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, but after seeing and hearing the alternatives such as Scott
<br>
McNealy and Larry Ellison, I'm not sure the world would be any better if
<br>
they were top dogs.  This nonsense about &quot;damage ... inflicted upon the
<br>
world&quot; just doesn't make any sense at all.  When I hear things like this, I
<br>
feel like you guys live in a totally different world than I do.  The
<br>
statement about &quot;not seeing the alternative branches which would now exist
<br>
if not for a number of specific  decisions, which can be traced back to the
<br>
year 1978&quot; implies some sort of evil conspiracy.  That doesn't make any
<br>
sense.  I posit that had a number of the chief competitors of your evil
<br>
monsters (IBM/Intel/Microsoft) not reacted so slowly/poorly to the PC
<br>
phenomenon of the late 70's, early 80's then the world WOULD be much
<br>
different now.  They had their chance and lost.  Microsoft/Intel/IBM was NOT
<br>
a sure thing back then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It should be given some thought, why so many computer people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have such a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction towards Redmond. Hint: sour grapes it ain't.
</em><br>
<p>Most of the programmer types that I know who hate Microsoft generally do it
<br>
cause it's the &quot;cool thing to do.&quot;  Yes, MS has done some despicable things
<br>
in the past and are probably still doing some, but that doesn't make the
<br>
company evil, and certainly doesn't prove some sort of evil conspiracy
<br>
theories.  Hatred for Microsoft seems to be some sort of religious
<br>
phenomenon in which logic and fact have no place.  *shrug*
