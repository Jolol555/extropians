&nbsp;From: Amara Graps &lt;<a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20Status%20of%20Science/math%20(was%20PSYCH:%20Women%20and%20Math)&In-Reply-To=&lt;OE48duV9t6Au4hiIwhq000015e0@hotmail.com&gt;">amara@amara.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; I don't agree about the 'lower status in society' in the societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where I've lived. I think the words: 'different status' or 'unique
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status' might be more appropriate. I agree with your assessment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the money earnings, however.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.  I was using the amount of money a profession earns as a rough
<br>
proxy for status.  'Unique status' is more accurate - most people are
<br>
impressed if you say you have a PhD in non-linear optics or some such.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe a useful note: every astronomer I know is in the astronomy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field because they love the work and not for the money (take an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronomer to lunch, please). Another note: the astronomers whom I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that have left the field because of the money lure, later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regretted it. As a point of reference: I cut my monthly earnings by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 2/3 in order to go for my astrophysics PhD. I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusions of big money in the coming years either, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly doesn't bother me.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps this is the difficulty with science/math and income - people do it
<br>
despite the money.  On a whole, most scientists and mathematicians I know
<br>
are gentle, unobtrusive folk who are more concerned with their work than
<br>
their income. Friends who have gone on to do PhD's have done so completely
<br>
aware of the income rates in their respective fields. I have never, ever
<br>
heard of scientists going on strike for a pay-rise. If anything, they're
<br>
more likely to go on strike for more and better equipment!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;As a living, physics and math just don't cut it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree.. Supporting one.. looks OK to me. Supporting more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than one person.. well.. could be a problem. Some high-paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consultant work on the side would be beneficial (!).
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm, I guess it depends on what it means to not 'cut it'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everyone needs to assess for themselves the &quot;money value&quot; compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the &quot;joy value&quot; of one's work-life, don't you think?
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. But with some luck and good planning, you can hopefully have
<br>
both. Currently, my priority is income, as I have to support 2 people and
<br>
pay back a student loan.  Once my partner gets past the first knee on the
<br>
lawyer income S-curve(!), I might start looking at doing a PhD.  Maybe I can
<br>
have my cake and eat it too :)
