Folks,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also forwarded my post on this topic to a friend not on the
<br>
extropy list.  He responded and here is my reply to his response.
<br>

<p>===================================================================
<br>
<p>Patrick,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you would have to be a DAMN good writer to find conflict in what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is basically a conflictless situation: a dearth of evil.  And that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what movies are about--conflict.  No conflict, no drama, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you're completely wrong here.  When such a movie with
<br>
real capable and good Gods is finally made and finally becomes
<br>
popular, can you imagine the looks on the Popes' and Prophets' faces,
<br>
since all their teachings, stories, and suffering fantasies, will, in
<br>
comparison, suddenly become blatantly obviously full of evil, death,
<br>
suffering, damnation, faithlessness - especially their finally
<br>
obviously in comparison evil views of a vengeful God and ET's who were
<br>
thought to be either unwilling or unable to do anything more to
<br>
help!?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything more epic, more dramatic, more full of evil
<br>
to be overcome (yet not really evil, since it is simply our own still
<br>
primitive ignorance, inability, and insanity) in all religions or all
<br>
stories ever told both fact and fiction?  Doesn't real truth and
<br>
reality always far outshine all fictions and religious stories in
<br>
infinitely glorious ways?  I think so.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the next 100 years, as we fight with the evil and
<br>
still insane ludites and deathists, as we are finally able to get some
<br>
of our children to a gloriously immortal heaven, as finally the last
<br>
of our loved ones are lost... It will be an infinitely more fantastic
<br>
and dramatic story in every conceivable way than any and all stories
<br>
ever told.  It will eternally be said that our parents really died or
<br>
more accurately really lived and overcam evil that our children might
<br>
eternally be.  And we are lucky enough to inherit all that our parents
<br>
have given us, to be alive, experience, and finally take this last
<br>
step of a very long war, to bring it all to pass, this most
<br>
significant and dramatic cusp in the greatest story (a non fiction one
<br>
at that) that will ever be told or experienced.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will make it, and who wont in this gratest final climactic
<br>
chapter of this story of the greatest and longest battle to overcome
<br>
all evil once and fore all?  This most anticipated of all endings of
<br>
all stories is occurring right before our very eyes.  Lets not be so
<br>
blind that we miss it entirely.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
