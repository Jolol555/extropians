</em><br>
<p>More recent than 1500 I'll grant you.  Recent, as in final decade
<br>
of the 20th century, I think not.  Something very similar to
<br>
modern transhumanism started occurring to smart people (like Samuel
<br>
Butler, in 1872), and even getting published, not long after Darwin spilled
<br>
the beans.  See, for example,
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q99/2568.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q99/2568.html</a>
<br>
or the more recent example
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q99/1485.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q99/1485.html</a> .
<br>
I'm willing to believe that Singularitarianism, as the inflationary,
<br>
positive-feedback-driven variety of transhumanism, can be
<br>
largely credited to Vernor Vinge (though I seem to recall seeing
<br>
somewhere that John von Neumann, or somebody of that period --
<br>
Norbert Wiener? Vannevar Bush? -- adumbrated something similar decades
<br>
earlier).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am, in general, bored with &quot;Hey, maybe yada-dada is a transhumanist!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posts - here, and on the Extropians list, and everywhere else in the Solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; System.  I do not care whether the Beatles, Einstein, or Christopher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Columbus were transhumanists or Singularitarians or whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Since I don't belong to the SL4 list (it doesn't seem to be archived on
<br>
the Web, as is the Extropians'), I haven't read the offending post,
<br>
though I've certainly contributed recent posts to the Extropians' which
<br>
might seems to fall under the cloud of the subject line
<br>
&quot;&gt;H and pop culture:  Who cares?&quot; :-&gt;  Your brief for SL4 (at
<br>
<a href="http://sysopmind.com/sing/SL4.html">http://sysopmind.com/sing/SL4.html</a> ) is &quot;The four virtues of an SL4 post are
<br>
Intelligence, Fun, Importance, and Future Shock.  Any post should have at
<br>
least one.&quot;  Certainly Fun, in the **writing**, is the sine qua non of anything
<br>
I bother to put together for the Extropians'.  Whether I'm providing enough Fun
<br>
for potential readers to justify the time they've wasted downloading
<br>
one of my own blurbs is hard for me to judge -- I usually get at least one response
<br>
along the lines of &quot;I enjoyed the article about...&quot;, and I haven't (yet)
<br>
gotten a response along the lines of &quot;this is utter trash, and a waste
<br>
of the time I spent downloading it&quot;, but I have no way of knowing that
<br>
99% of the list doesn't killfile me right into the garbage (and I can't
<br>
say I care that much, as long as I'm not getting hate mail :-&gt;).
<br>
Extropians' is unmoderated, so the standards are set by a subtle and
<br>
complex social process depending on who's attracted to the list in the
<br>
first place, who musters up the energy and chuzpah to post (for
<br>
whatever complicated reasons), and the aggregate feedback they get
<br>
thereafter.  In a moderated or edited forum, it's another story.
<br>
Some writers and editors from the traditional book, newspaper, and magazine
<br>
publishing industry have taken a publicly dim view of the very low signal-to-noise
<br>
ratio and shockingly low standards of veracity, pertinence, or sheer literary
<br>
style on the Wild Web -- and some of this harrumphing is just a cover-up for
<br>
fear of loss of control, influence, and livelihood.  So what's to
<br>
be done?  Are you volunteering to moderate the Extropians'?
<br>
<p>As far as the relevance of pop culture is concerned -- I thought one of
<br>
the perennial foci of this list was the propagation of Extropian and
<br>
transhumanist memes (to use the popular jargon for this sort of thing),
<br>
and to discuss the memetic import vis a vis Extropianism of elements
<br>
of the wider culture, so that discussion of books, movies, and TV shows
<br>
was within the pale.  You have acknowledged in your own Web publications
<br>
that sci-fi (surely that comes under the aegis of pop culture, does it not?)
<br>
was intimately bound up in the coalescence of your thinking about
<br>
the Singularity.  Are the circumstances now &quot;been there, done that,
<br>
time to move on&quot;, meaning that nothing that doesn't look like it
<br>
belongs on the Eurekalert page or in an investment newsletter is
<br>
appropriate?  In any case, I thought that's what the private
<br>
Singularitarians' list was for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason I'm confident in my ideas is that a very smart person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agrees with them - *me*.  If someone else also agrees with me, good for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *them*...  [A]t the end of the day, the reason you believe in your ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that *you* decided they were right.  You don't really give a damn what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else in the solar system thinks, though you may think you ought to.
</em><br>
<p>In an interview on one of my Bertrand Russell records, the great man
<br>
comments that if you're a genius, you also have to have enormous
<br>
self confidence if you're going to accomplish anything worthwhile, because
<br>
the rest of the world is going to be trying to discourage you every step
<br>
of the way.  So I think it's terrific that you've got the self confidence
<br>
exhibited in this remark, particularly if it's true that you're one of the
<br>
handful of people currently alive who might have the wherewithal to bring about
<br>
the Singularity (though if so, one might suggest that you spend a bit
<br>
too much time on mailing lists like this one ;-&gt;).
<br>
<p>For mere mortals like myself, the network of belief is far less self-
<br>
conscious and self-examined.  Maybe one or two patterns in the skein
<br>
come clear enough from time to time to be examined in any detail,
<br>
only to sink back into forgetfulness.  It's like the large software
<br>
system I maintain at work -- I can get a particular small piece of
<br>
it into sharp enough focus to make an enhancement or track down a
<br>
bug by means of a period of intense concentration that's almost like
<br>
going into a trance, but afterwards (maybe only a week afterwards)
<br>
the details have subsided once again into the murk.  I harbor no
<br>
hope that my own beliefs are independent of social milieu (although
<br>
social milieu these days is fortunately not simply a matter of
<br>
geographical propinquity), and every reason to believe (based on
<br>
my own more-or-less vague impressions about human evolutionary and
<br>
social psychology) that I'm constantly, albeit unconsciously, comparing
<br>
and checking my own beliefs about all sorts of things against the information
<br>
I'm absorbing every day from my social surroundings (which includes,
<br>
as one small component, this very list).
<br>
<p>Nor do I harbor any illusions about the ratio of original to recycled
<br>
thought in anything I say, do, or write.  For this humble consumer
<br>
in the early 21st century human economic nexus, to add a barely-visible
<br>
toothmark to a well-chewed meme would be an accomplishment worth
<br>
celebrating, and that's not an attempt at self-effacement or false
<br>
modesty, that's just the way it is.  I view my reading of this list as
<br>
a form of entertainment.  My writing for this list is also, in my view,
<br>
primarily for my own entertainment (with the hope that at least a
<br>
few other subscribers are also entertained, and that nobody is
<br>
particularly bothered).
<br>
<p>Cheers.
<br>
