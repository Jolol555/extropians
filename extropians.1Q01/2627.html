<p>Actually, democrats are now claiming that the outgoing GOP
<br>
administration did similar things, but they cannot cite any published
<br>
accounts to support these claims. Its more of the typical spoiled brat
<br>
Clinton rationalization of &quot;well, they did it too&quot;. This is the same
<br>
Clinton administration that claimed that it would have the most ethical
<br>
administration in history. I don't buy it.
