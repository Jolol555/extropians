Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Humans have natural rights because of the type of natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being they are, because of their specific nature.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where 'natural' in 'natural rights' comes from.   'Rights'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this context are those conditions in the interactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among human beings required by human beings, by their nature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for optimal functioning.  Most such rights are negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the non-initiation of physical force rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive such as the supposed right some claim to goods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided by the work of others.
</em><br>
<p>Counting from the beginning of the quoted paragraph, the third sentence
<br>
makes sense to me. [Others don't.] &quot;Rights are those conditions in the
<br>
interactions among human beings required by human beings for optimal
<br>
functioning.&quot; That is OK, that is the essence of my definition of 'rights'
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p>What doesn't make sense to me is your attempt to state that such
<br>
'conditions' are predetermined, and eternal. I have no capacity to
<br>
understand how anyone could believe such utter nonsense. I hope you don't
<br>
actually believe that? Do you seriously believe that such 'conditions', as
<br>
you stated, are predetermined and eternal?
<br>
<p>If you do, you sound utterly totalitarian to me, no matter how you might
<br>
think you're not. Because if it is so, you're making an outrageous
<br>
assumption that every human being's &quot;requirements for optimal functioning&quot;
<br>
are the same - and indeed, that such requirements never change.
<br>
<p>[Don't you have some kind of national education in high schools in America?
<br>
Perhaps even primary and secondary schools? Where you learn, somewhat
<br>
nationalistically as I hear, and several times per week, about your country
<br>
and your legal system and your rights? I think we might actually be on the
<br>
same wavelength, only you refuse to call the thing anything other than what
<br>
the &quot;memes you're infected with tell you to&quot;, as Michael Lorry might say if
<br>
he were European. :-) ]
