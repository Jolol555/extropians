NO NO NO STAY AWAY FROM THE EYES or any part of the face!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
Very high voltage from UV wands, Van de Graff generators etc can BURN.
<br>
<p>Also stay way from any current across the chest.
<br>
<p>even a 9 volt battery can kill if the contacts break the skin and the current
<br>
crosses the heart.
<br>
<p>the most likely reason you feel like the field has its own life is as you
<br>
break the natural field it will deform the electric field in a dynamic fashion. 
<br>
<p>any college level text book on electric fields might be interesting, they do
<br>
require differential equations though.
<br>
<p>and yes they are fun to play with but do so with care, the output levels
<br>
were never designed for biological use.
<br>
<p>also tesla coils are a lot of fun but reqquire a LOT more care to play with
<br>
<p>Best Ralph

<em>&gt;I didn't have the resources to purchase a discharge the discharge electrode,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Amazing beyond description!  Kind of a cute little widget.  Looks like a

<em>&gt;little household robot!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anyway, it's a wonderful feeling to play with the electrostatic cloud.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fun to be not so close as to arc, close enough the keep a good flow between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the body and the unit.  As the cloud grows, the body move farther and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;farther away from the ball and feel the cloud following and clinging.  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course, moving too quickly breaks the circuit between the body and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generator and the cloud &quot;withdraws&quot; and that invisible touchy-feely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensation drops dramatically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's bizarre!  I'd swear that there's some kind of intelligence in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cloud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even when using my finger as a wand and doing the little lightning bolt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing from 13&quot; away, the rythm of the snapping sound is almost musical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Like morse code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;da-dit-dit-dit-zzz-dit-zzz-dit-dit-dit-zzz-dit-zzz-dit-dit-dit-zz-dit-zz-dit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--.. (hard to express with plain text).  Wierd how that fuzzy &quot;spider web&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensation follows me around the house.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd swear I have an electrode in my pleasure center that stimulates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nucleus accumbens whenever I'm in the best posture for the maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continuity of the cloud around my body.  Also I've noticed that the cloud
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changes as I change the pressure of my lower teeth against my upper teeth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Have you ever tried biting &quot;down&quot; on only one size of your mouth, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;switching to the other side?  The sensation of the cloud is similar and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems related to my eyeball movements as well as posture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What the heck is going on?  Is this the &quot;best kept secret&quot; or what!?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I like licking 9 volt batteries with the tip of my tongue.  Seems perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;safe.  Went ahead and started using my tongue as a discharge electrode from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about 1 foot from the ball.  Freaky.  Looks cool with the lights out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Major question for you scientists: could I use my eyeballs as well?  It's be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of cool to look a lightning bolt in the eye as it travels a foot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through the air straight into the center of the cornea!  Anyone tried this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yet?  I'm itching to give it a try but haven't gotten up the nerve; it'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bite to have blurry vision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since playing with the thing, I can feel my mother from across the room when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;she walks into the room.  Enchanting and heart warming.  She's got some good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I get absent-minded at times (careless, I suppose).  I went straight from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one-hour session with the Van de Graff and sat down at the computer and put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my hand on the mouse.  Pop-snap!  Suddenly the X-axis on the mouse arrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stopped working.  Cleaned the rollers, but didn't fix it.  Y-axis worked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fine, though.  Replaced it with an optical mouse, but will try to correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the root cause of the problem by installing a grounded-discharge pad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somewhere near the computer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
