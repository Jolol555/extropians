BIO Asks Bush to Continue Ban on Human Cloning 
<br>
<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) Feb 01 - The lead lobbying organization for 
<br>
the biotechnology industry on Thursday urged President George W. Bush 
<br>
to support the current voluntary ban on human cloning.  
<br>
<p>The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) told the president that 
<br>
the moratorium should be continued &quot;because we view this specific 
<br>
cloning technology as unsafe and because the prospect of cloning 
<br>
humans raises profound moral, religious and bioethical concerns.&quot;  
<br>
<p>BIO's call for a continued ban on human cloning follows recent news 
<br>
that an international group of reproductive experts plans to launch 
<br>
an effort to clone humans on behalf of infertile couples.  
<br>
<p>The industry group first voiced its support of a ban on cloning 
<br>
humans in 1997, after scientists announced the cloning of the sheep 
<br>
named Dolly. &quot;Today the technology to clone a human being still is 
<br>
not safe and the full range of moral and ethical concerns still has 
<br>
not been addressed,&quot; BIO President Carl F. Feldbaum said in his 
<br>
letter to Bush.  
<br>
<p>BIO, which represents 940 biotechnology companies and academic 
<br>
institutions across the country, stressed that it supports cloning of 
<br>
specific human cells, genes and other tissues. As Feldbaum explained, 
<br>
&quot;These techniques are integral to the production of breakthrough 
<br>
medicines, diagnostics and vaccines to treat heart attacks, various 
<br>
cancers, Alzheimer's, diabetes, hepatitis and other diseases.&quot;  
<br>
<p>Feldbaum's letter attempts to distinguish between what he calls &quot;very 
<br>
legitimate biomedical research&quot; and attempts to clone a child.  
<br>
<p>As far as human cloning, &quot;We don't feel that the science is there 
<br>
yet,&quot; he said. &quot;It took 270-some attempts to clone Dolly, a sheep, 
<br>
and those odds even now if they're reduced to 1 in 100 are really non-
<br>
acceptable.&quot;  
<br>
<p>BIO also hopes to head off backlash against the biotechnology 
<br>
industry; public outcry over human cloning could result in 
<br>
legislative proposals that interfere with efforts to cure intractable 
<br>
diseases, Feldbaum suggested.
