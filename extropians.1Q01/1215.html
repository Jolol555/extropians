This looks more stupid the more I learn about it.
<br>
<p>I don't want to ride a scooter around the city.  Even if it can go up 
<br>
stairs, automatically balances, and folds into a small package. 
<br>
Unless it can go as fast as a car, I won't want to ride it in the 
<br>
streets.  If I ride it on the sidewalk, I'll have to go as slow as 
<br>
the pedestrians.  I'll have to carry it inside with me or chain it up 
<br>
outside like a bicycle.  I doubt that whole cities will be built 
<br>
around this thing anymore than around bicycles.  If it's raining, 
<br>
I'll get wet.  If it's cold, the wind as I move will make me even 
<br>
colder.  If it's sunny, I'll be standing in the sun at every 
<br>
stoplight.
<br>
<p>This will probably be as popular as motorized wheelchairs.  Certain 
<br>
individuals will find them useful, but the general public won't. 
<br>
Unless the patent is deliberately misleading, I don't see what the 
<br>
fuss is about.  It is a definite advance in scooter technology, but 
<br>
then I am not a scooter enthusiast.
