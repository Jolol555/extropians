Friends,

<p>Hmmm.  This suggests an alternate, more aggressive approach to promoting
<br>
cryonics.  A class action lawsuit with defendants: the entire medical
<br>
profession and the rest of the public and private health care
<br>
infrastructure, plaintiffs: the survivors of all the unsuspended dead.
<br>
Nothing like a big bucks lawsuit pointed directly at your cushy assets to
<br>
snap you back and get you real serious real fast.  The easy ridicule and
<br>
dismissive nonchalance might begin to show some strain with Johnny Cochran
<br>
and Allen Dershowitz talking about damage amounts in the TRILLIONS of
<br>
dollars.  I'm not saying there's any chance to win, but I'm looking at a
<br>
BIG jump in public awareness of the underlying issues.
<br>
<p>When the medicos have exhausted their repertoire of 'established'
<br>
therapies, and it's get-your-affairs-in-order time, isn't it a failure of
<br>
informed consent for them to not tell you about an available last-ditch
<br>
option? (Probably 'informed consent' isn't the right legal theory, but you
<br>
get my drift.)
<br>
<p>Some time back I came across this article at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://news.uns.purdue.edu/UNS/html4ever/0002.Borgens.PEG.html">http://news.uns.purdue.edu/UNS/html4ever/0002.Borgens.PEG.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Purdue News
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        February 2000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Polymer repairs nerve damage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        in animals with spinal injuries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – A brief application of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        polymer commonly used in medicine and cosmetics has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        been shown to immediately repair damaged nerve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        membranes in live guinea pigs with severe spinal cord
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        injuries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The polymer, called polyethylene glycol or PEG, works
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        by &quot;fusing&quot; the membranes of damaged nerve cells, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        can be applied up to eight hours after the injury without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        adversely affecting the patient's recovery.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        PEG is a nontoxic, water-soluble polymer widely used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        medicine and cosmetics. In the study, Borgens and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        team applied the substance across a region of the guinea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        pig's crushed spinal cord.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        &quot;In most spinal cord injuries in animals and in people, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        spinal cord is not completely severed, but is more likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        be crushed,&quot; he says. &quot;It is this crushing or compression of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        the spinal cord that causes the nerve fibers to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        holes in their membranes, which ultimately leads to cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        death and separation of the nerve fiber within 24 to 72
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        hours. If the nerve fibers separate, or otherwise do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        conduct impulses, paralysis will occur.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        PEG was applied for two minutes, then removed. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        group of animals received the application immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        after the injury, while a second group of animals was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        treated with PEG eight hours after the injury. Following
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        the PEG applications, all the animals were tested to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        measure their ability to conduct nerve impulses through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        spinal cord and to gauge their recovery of functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Nerve impulses through the spinal cord were measured by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        stimulating a nerve in the hind leg and determining whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        and when the impulses arrived at the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Of the 47 guinea pigs used in the study, all 25 of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        animals that received PEG were able to recover some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        nerve conduction – from 20 percent to 50 percent –
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        within 15 minutes after PEG was applied. Measurements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        taken days and weeks later showed that, in addition, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        nerve conduction recovery continued to improve up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        one month after the initial treatment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Of the 22 animals that did not receive PEG, not one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        animal recovered the ability to conduct nerve impulses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        through the spinal cord, Borgens says.
</em><br>
<p>I was impressed by the hopeful nature of this finding, so
<br>
I dashed off a little note to the heads of Neurosurgery at several leading
<br>
medical establishments, Mass General, Walter Reed, Stanford, etc,
<br>
suggesting that they might have some legal vulnerability if, knowing of the
<br>
above treatment possibility, they failed to inform any spinal cord injury
<br>
patients that might thereafter come through their door, of that
<br>
potential--though unproven--therapy.  As you might imagine, I got some
<br>
quick and some very angry responses.  I had hoped that as a result of
<br>
having been provably notified, they would respond by finding a way to speed
<br>
up the therapeutic evaluation of the peg application technique (for all I
<br>
know they may have done just that).  But I can say that, beyond question, I
<br>
got their attention.
<br>
<p>Thus my suggestion that a malpractice lawsuit for failure to notify,
<br>
inform, recommend, or apply cryonic suspension as a 'final meliorative
<br>
clinical intervention against irreversible morbidity'.
<br>
<p>Let's see Peter Jennings smirk at that!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
