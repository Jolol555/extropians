<em>&gt; Your going to be stuck on a desert island, what three books

</em><br>
<p>I'm going to cheat and say &quot;Technological Civilization: A Builders 
<br>
Manual&quot;. The book doesn't exist, but I've been seriously thinking of 
<br>
writing it for about 10 years now. The intent is to provide all of the 
<br>
information needed to produce a technological base able to create some 
<br>
particular high-tech device (such as a satellite transciever or maybe an 
<br>
hydrofoil, I've never decided what) starting from the raw materials found 
<br>
on a desert island. To be done right, the book needs to have ways of 
<br>
adapting to missing raw materials, and to give the easiest/most reliable 
<br>
method of attaining the final goal.
<br>
<p>I've been collecting some source materials with the goal of writing the 
<br>
book, but its been hard finding the right sorts of information.
<br>
<p>My second book would probably be some sort of home medical guide, and the 
<br>
third would be some sort of handicrafts manual, with emphasis on making 
<br>
your own nets, fishing gear and maybe spears.
