<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The term &quot;poisoned&quot; often implies that the person has ingested a poison.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The definition you used above makes the concept &quot;poisoned&quot; a less meaningful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; one. Or maybe you try to make a political statement on the badness of giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a subject a substance without their consent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; By your definition above, if you administer any kind of medication to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; unconscious, you either poison that human, or that human lost its citizenship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; with its consciousness, both rather uncommon standpoints.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think if it's administered under the Hippocratic oath or similar moral and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethical standards, that's different.  Administering emergency medicine to save the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life of another when they would otherwise die against their will is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; admirable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So administering LSD or other drugs to reprogram an incorrigible capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderer/serial killer so that they can be rehabilitated would be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable than executing them? When the alternative is execution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-programming is a decent alternative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A HEALTH ISSUE.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand that humans in some jurisdictions temporarily lose their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rights when convicted for a crime, so in those jurisdictions you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; find it acceptable to perform that kind of re-programming, then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is an ambiguous term.  From watching the television show &quot;Cops&quot;, I have watched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that television show.  Some police use immediate intimidation regularly.  I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some business with sheriff's departments.  If a violent drunk has started a fight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and continues, he should be subdued non-chemically and placed in a holding van or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cell.  The police can carry tasers to incapacitate anyone, almost regardless of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether they are on PCP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Citizens have rights with regards to anyone trying to &quot;reprogram&quot; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But felons are effectively 'non-citizens' in many respects. Until a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felon is judged fit to return to society, judged to be willing and able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to participate as law abiding citizens, they shouldn't be reintroduced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into that society. Perhaps 'reprogramming' would be acceptable to you if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it were merely a choice a prisoner could make as an alternative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remaining in prison?
</em><br>
<p>You say some felons some are not citizens, do you say they are not human?  I say they
<br>
are humans and many citizens.
<br>
<p>Reprogramming except in the context of regular education through trade skill and
<br>
literary learning and punishments for violent behavior, should not be a focus.  It
<br>
sounds too cavalier to apply your meat rules to the brains of these prisoners.
<br>
<p>If, after valid psychological examination in a psychologically healthy environment, it
<br>
is determined a mild sedative will help the prisoner cope with his violence issues, then
<br>
that may be prescribed.
<br>
<p>In this thread I permuted the subject to &quot;No Parole for Federales&quot; to suggest to apply
<br>
the cane to them.
