</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In theory, I might agree. In practice, I would not. [Meaning: it seems a far
<br>
stretch to me.]
<br>
<p>First of all, I don't subscribe to the idea that we are in any way all the
<br>
same, hence I dislike the claim that the nature of human beings is a given.
<br>
If this were true, it would imply that all people want to be treated the
<br>
same, in all respects. I don't subscribe to that. That is point #1.
<br>
<p>But let's assume that the nature of human beings is a given: all people want
<br>
to be treated the same, in all respects. How do we then extrapolate human
<br>
rights (R) from your definition? Why, we take the 'given nature' (N) of
<br>
human beings (H), we take the environment into which these beings are placed
<br>
(E), and then we find the optimal set of rules R such that, when these rules
<br>
are followed:
<br>
&nbsp;a) The highest proportion of H will be satisfied in E.
<br>
&nbsp;b) Or, alternatively, the lowest proportion of H will suffer in E.
<br>
&nbsp;c) Or some other combination of criteria. (Which one?)
<br>
<p>As you can see, we have difficulty selecting even the rules to determine R,
<br>
given E and N. That is point #2.
<br>
<p>Also, I asserted that R depends on E and N, not just N. That seems a rather
<br>
straightforward implication to me: I see no reason to assume that the result
<br>
of extrapolating R from N will be the same for every E. For instance, the
<br>
result would be different in a labile community, such as an expedition to
<br>
Mars, where everyone's death is imminent unless everyone follows strict
<br>
rules, than in a stable, Earth-based community, where rules can be and
<br>
should be much more relaxed. So, we have the additional difficulty of having
<br>
to extrapolate R from N for every conceivable E. That would be point #3.
<br>
<p>Also, any given E changes with time. So we have a dependence on time (T) as
<br>
well: we have to re-apply the above extrapolation as often as necessary to
<br>
retain consistency. That would be point #4.
<br>
<p>Finally, would anyone please show me a person who can, given N and E,
<br>
extrapolate R? Do we even have a way of defining N in a strict sense? Not
<br>
that I know of, unless we limit ourselves to ideal cases. Do we have a way
<br>
of defining E in a strict sense? Not that I know of, unless we limit
<br>
ourselves to ideal cases.
<br>
<p>So, I would like to assert that it is infeasible to extrapolate R given N
<br>
and E. That would be point #5.
<br>
<p>So, yes, in theory, and only if point #1 is false, Rights(N, E) could be
<br>
considered universal and predetermined: just as you could say, &quot;Well, the
<br>
universe seems to function on predetermined rules, so it seems that it must
<br>
all be determined.&quot; Yes, it might be. But how do you calculate what tomorrow
<br>
will be, given the initial state of the universe? With difficulty, at
<br>
minimum.
<br>
<p>I hope I have shown in sufficient detail why I think your assertion of
<br>
eternal, predetermined human rights is rather useless. There's no way of
<br>
applying it. For the time being, I see no better way to determine the best
<br>
rules of conduct in any given situation than by implicit (tacit) or explicit
<br>
negotiation between everyone involved.
<br>
<p>Or at least most of the most influential people involved, as is more often
<br>
the case. Your country's fundamental documents might say that human rights
<br>
are eternal and given, but they were still negotiated: someone, a human
<br>
being or a group of human beings, *decided* what these rights should be, and
<br>
they wrote them down into the constitution. I'm quite sure that they didn't
<br>
determine N and E, and then extrapolated R from that. What they defined R to
<br>
be is the result of a lively discussion; in other words, negotiation; and
<br>
the result is somewhat specific to the environment E that they lived in.
<br>
<p>So, no, human rights are not a given, no matter what your school teacher
<br>
said. School teachers told lots of nonsense to me, too, but that doesn't
<br>
mean I have to believe it.
