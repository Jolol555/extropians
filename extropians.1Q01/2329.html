In a message dated 1/24/01 1:59:30 AM Pacific Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20Ethics%20in%20a%20void%20(Re:%20meaning%20of%20life%20(RE:%20(repost)%20))&In-Reply-To=&lt;ee.102e064f.27a03831@aol.com&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</a> writes:&lt;&lt;  If your theory of rights is derived from 
<br>
human nature, then you are ill-equipped to do business with sapients that are 
<br>
non-human -- unless you can coerce them into pretending to be human.  
<br>
Moreover, the natural rights theory of the 18th century is infused with 
<br>
religiosity: the US constitution reeks of deism, and the country that it 
<br>
belongs to has a higher per-capita proportion of fundamentalists than just 
<br>
about anywhere on the planet except Afghanistan and Iran. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Charlie,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might like to look at Robert L. Humphrey's VALUES FOR A NEW MILLENIUM 
<br>
where in he claims to have found a couple of basic natural rights that are 
<br>
shared by all human societies and seem to be shared by some of our animal 
<br>
friends.  He also asserts that Thomas Jefferson's philosophy as having 
<br>
derived from a member of the Scotish enlightenment instead the normal sources 
<br>
for the other founding fathers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further Mihal Csikszentmihalye in FLOW and THE EVOLVING SELF asserts a 
<br>
measure of happiness that can gauge all societies.  He shares some 
<br>
measurements from a number of different societies and they were at least 
<br>
surprising and worth pondering.
