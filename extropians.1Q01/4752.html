<p><em>&gt; So what's the problem? It's this: for the first time, the process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological and business innovation amplifies the normal rhythms of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Funding for innovation now depends on the state of the stock market and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the expected growth of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology has become synchronized with the ups and downs of the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      The result is that the Old Economy business cycle has been replaced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the New Economy tech cycle: longer expansions, followed by deeper and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harsher recessions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      On the upside, innovation and economic growth reinforce each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More money spent on innovation means faster growth with low inflation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Faster growth and a rising stock market increase the incentives to invest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation - which yields more startups, faster adoption of technology, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more pressure on existing companies to keep up.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with this is the assumption that &quot;innovation&quot; funded by
<br>
capital investment leads almost immediately to faster growth.  But I
<br>
don't think this time frame is correct, and I think also that the
<br>
connection between these innovations and growth is much more tenuous.
<br>
Economists have strained to see any measurable increase in productivity
<br>
from the introduction of computers into the work place, and this has
<br>
been going on for 20 years now.
<br>
<p>I doubt that even the most hyped technologies to come out of Silicon
<br>
Valley over the past five years have actually led to significant economic
<br>
growth since then.  They may have excited investors with their prospects
<br>
and led to some stock run-ups, but it is hard to see any measurable
<br>
increase in economic output within the kinds of time frame the article
<br>
is talking about.
<br>
<p>Turning it around, then, if investors pull out of technology stocks, the
<br>
economy is not going to grind to a halt just because the next version of
<br>
Java comes out a couple of years late.  Innovation takes time to percolate
<br>
through society, and if the money burned through in the past 10 years
<br>
did accomplish something, we will be its beneficiaries for years to come.
<br>
Any increases in productivity of labor or capital due to technology will
<br>
help cushion a forthcoming recession, not steepen it.
<br>
<p>Having said that, it is certainly possible that we will have a tech
<br>
recession; there's no reason to suppose that any industry is immune.
<br>
But I don't see why it should be particularly long or deep.  Recessions
<br>
are necessary in the long run, like forest fires.  They clear out the
<br>
dead wood and get people to focus on what works.  A good year or two
<br>
of cutbacks will leave the industry ready to move forward and grow.
<br>
It's happened countless times before in other industries.
<br>
<p>Doomsayers love to point to 1929, but with hindsight we can see what
<br>
went wrong back then.  We won't make those mistakes again.  (We'll make
<br>
different ones.)  The article raises the spectre of the &quot;stagflation&quot;
<br>
of the 1970s, but even that was cured with the Reagan recession which
<br>
lasted about a year and was soon forgotten.  By the time he ran for
<br>
reelection, it was &quot;Morning in America&quot; again and we had several years
<br>
of strong growth.
