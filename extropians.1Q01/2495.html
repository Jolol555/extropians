<em>&gt; Great suggestion!  But, given that all of what you said is true, exactly

<p>Not making an AI which could come into the positive autofeedback enhancement

loop. The mechanism by which an AI seed can suddenly gain orders of magnitude 
<br>
more computational resources is as far as I can see:
<br>
<p>1) by enhancing the hitherto inefficient coding on the same hardware 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(redesigning itself to optimally utilize the given hardware platform,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the usual bootstrap effect). 
<br>
<p>2) by grabbing more hardware (hostile action)
<br>
<p>3) by designing and building its own hardware (relatively slow, but (hyper)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exponential)
<br>
<p>I suggest we focus on the first two issues here. I already have my
<br>
ideas, but how for a little unbiased brainstorming here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you are right, are going to be more or less annoyed with us if we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Even better, not trying to tax the &gt;H ones at all. I'd suggest
<br>
as many perks as possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; heard Hans Moravec state that we should be happy in building our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary successors but not expect to stay around?  Seriously, what
</em><br>
<p>This is not a rational strategy. I think one could call Hans M. a
<br>
borderline pathological personality. Cannibal mindchildren is not my idea
<br>
of a happy parenthood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; does being careful look like given your view of the situation and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much does it matter beyond insuring we are around long enough to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs started?  I'm not saying this is (or isn't) my view.  I'm just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to understand more fully what yours is.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have a fixed strategy, because the problem domain is not that.
