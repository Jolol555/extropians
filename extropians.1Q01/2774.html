<em>&gt; &gt; I am looking forward towards a time when technology will enable us to limit

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course he got raked over the coals by the knee-jerk libertarians here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but Denis makes a good point.  Given that you are going to have laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all (whether privately enforced, public, negotiated or whatever),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it makes sense that uniform and consistent application is preferable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haphazard and random enforcement.  One of the great advances of Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society was the move towards the &quot;rule of law&quot; rather than the &quot;rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of men&quot;.  Removing the element of capriciousness from law enforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes it easier for everyone to make decisions.
</em><br>
<p><p>Knee-jerk?  Reaction antagonistic to a proposal to wire up human beings
<br>
or their environment in such a way that they have no choice but to obey
<br>
whatever laws have been passed by their government is &quot;knee-jerk&quot;?  The
<br>
rule of law is not what is sacred.  The rights of human beings are
<br>
supposed to be protected by laws.  Reversing the equation where the law
<br>
determines the human beings is utterly perverse.
<br>
<p>Men make the laws.  Men are fallible and corruptible.  Therefore
<br>
absolute enforcement of the law cannot help but be pernicious.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Imagine that other aspects of life, such as contracts for employment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were enforced in the same random way that most laws are today.  There's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain chance you won't get paid at all, another chance that you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get paid what you should, a different chance that you'll be paid twice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much, and so on.  Would anyone argue that such a system is superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to one where you have consistent and reliable expectations about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes of your actions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But this does not require hard-wiring the environment or employers. It
<br>
is a matter of normal enforcement of contracts with quite a bit of
<br>
wiggle room on what is and is not a valid contract and so on.  It is not
<br>
what is being proposed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; automatically lead to a more restrictive society.  But this assumes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society does not already have the degree of restrictiveness that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire on the average.  If that were true, people would already have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased penalties and/or spent more money on law enforcement.  The fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that society is (roughly) in a steady state on these issues indicates that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the degree of restrictiveness is approximately what is already desired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With more effective law enforcement tools, Denis is entirely correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we should expect the laws to be relaxed correspondingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary.  If the politicians knew for a fact that whatever law
<br>
they passed absolutely would be enforced because there was no room for
<br>
it to be otherwise and all means of effective protest could be squelched
<br>
by passing and perfectly enforcing a properly crafted set of laws, then
<br>
we would be headed pell mell to a dictatorship deeper and more complete
<br>
than anything this world has ever seen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want to gamble, go to the casinos.  But in your legal relationships
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with society, predictability and reliability is preferable.
</em><br>
<p>It is not a crapshoot.  We do have laws and contracts.  But we also have
<br>
room to question the laws and contracts and where necessary to remodel
<br>
them.  That a law is enforced perfectly may give pause to an honest
<br>
lawmaker.  But many lawmakers are not that honest.  
<br>
<p>Shackling free people from having any choice is enslavement regardless
<br>
of how much predictability and reliability you think are possible to get
<br>
by such means.  Where there is no freedom of choice there is no
<br>
morality.
