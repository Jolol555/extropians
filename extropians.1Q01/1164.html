<em>&gt; &gt; Me, I just wanna live forever, and I am not sure if all this energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; devoted to corporate free marketeering is gonna get me there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corporate free marketeering has a better chance of getting you there than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passé alternatives offered by N. Korea, Russia, or Communist China, don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I just try to use common sense. I know that the people who work for 
<br>
governments are not very good workers. I can see that. It's not efficient. 
<br>
But what has happened is that the rebuttal to that solution has been taken to 
<br>
extremes. These extremes are bad news for many many people in the West.
<br>
<p>If we want to be immortal, I suspect that the answer may lie not in any one 
<br>
economic model, but in turning everyone to our viewpoint. Or perhaps I should 
<br>
say, my viewpoint, because I seriously that any of you hold the same 
<br>
viewpoints I do, not surprisingly. 
<br>
To motivate others to the goal, to make them see that the goal is both 
<br>
desirable and possibly attainable, is the real task, and meaningless 
<br>
adherence to some economic philosophy is a hindrance. 
<br>
<p>How can you possibbly argue that blind free marketeering in pursuit of profit 
<br>
is anywhere near as efficient as if tomorrow, every person in the world woke 
<br>
up and said, &quot; I want to live forever, and let's all join hands to make it 
<br>
so.&quot; Kind of a Manhattan Project sequel. Unrealistic? It's happened before.
<br>
<p>You would drive your car willy nilly in every direction in order to get from 
<br>
point A to point B. You may call it socialism or facism, but when you say 
<br>
that, I say you're living in the past.
