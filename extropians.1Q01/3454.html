<em>&gt; I scanned your post thrice and found nothing the least bit pessimistic

</em><br>
<em>&gt; your case Adrian.
</em><br>
<p>Pessimism: that such measures may be needed to colonize Mars.
<br>
<p>Optimism: that it is likely that someone with morals and values like us
<br>
would be the one to do so, and thus at least significantly influence
<br>
whatever government-equivalent system arises when the Martian human
<br>
population rises to a large enough level to want one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as I can see, the first person who gets to Mars to stay

<em>&gt; owns Mars, all of it.  Or at least as far as her gun can fire.  Like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it or hate it, Mars will eventually be converted entirely into
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It will take a while to build some guns once up there.  Hopefully, any
<br>
such operation will be small enough not to attract government meddling
<br>
until the guns are in place, but there may be competing commercial
<br>
colonies up there.  It would be in their mutual interest not to fire at
<br>
each other (very much like Prisoner's Dillema), but only one of them
<br>
needs to fear Earth government or desire Martian independence enough to
<br>
shoot when and if the army comes to seize control.
