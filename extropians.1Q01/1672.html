<p>
A panel of US physicists and astronomers 
<br>
<a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/bpa/projects/cpu/">http://www.nationalacademies.org/bpa/projects/cpu/</a>
<br>
has identified a list of eleven fundamental questions about the 
<br>
nature of the universe that will require the combined skills of 
<br>
particle physicists and astrophysicists to answer. 
<br>
The questions are in &quot;From quarks to the cosmos&quot;, the first report 
<br>
from the committee on the physics of the universe set up by the
<br>
National Academy of Sciences.
<br>
The eleven questions are:
<br>
* What is dark matter?
<br>
* What are the masses of the neutrinos
<br>
and how have they shaped the evolution of the universe?
<br>
* Are there additional spacetime dimensions?
<br>
* What is the nature of the dark energy?
<br>
* Are protons unstable?
<br>
* How did the Universe begin?
<br>
* Did Einstein have the last word on gravity?
<br>
* How do cosmic accelerators work and what are they accelerating?
<br>
* Are there new states of matter at exceedingly high density and
<br>
temperature?
<br>
* Is a new theory of matter and light needed at the highest energies?
<br>
* How were the elements from iron and uranium made?
<br>
The committee is keen to bring physicists and astronomers together
<br>
to tackle these questions, and is optimistic that the enormous leaps
<br>
in technology - including the exponential growth of computing speed -
<br>
and our understanding of the universe that have occurred over the last
<br>
twenty years will bring fresh insights to the debate. A second report,
<br>
due in late 2001, will prioritize the questions and make 
<br>
recommendations about funding.
