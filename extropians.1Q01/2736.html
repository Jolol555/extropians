</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Europe has of course used nudity like this for a number of years, but
<br>
I am skeptical that we will see it in the U.S. in this time frame.
<br>
<p>There was an FX claim several years ago that we would see nudity on TV.
<br>
It was satisfied by the broadcast of Schindler's List, which although
<br>
it shadowed the breasts there were a couple of scenes where nipples were
<br>
visible, and that satisified the claim.
<br>
<p>This was a highly controversial judgement because the claim excluded
<br>
&quot;reality based&quot; shows like National Geographic specials, and it was
<br>
unclear whether Schindler should count.  In the end it was judged that
<br>
it was not reality based in this sense and the claim was satisified.
<br>
However it is clear that the network only allowed the nudity because the
<br>
movie was a serious and sober look at a terribly sad episode in history.
<br>
It was not at all the kind of lighthearted exploitation of nudity that
<br>
Spike envisions.
<br>
<p>I think America is still too prudish to allow nudity in ads, at least
<br>
frontal nudity.  Maybe we'll see more bare butts.  They've used those
<br>
in prime time so this would be the logical next frontier in advertising.
