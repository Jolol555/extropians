</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Antarctica and spew it into the sky on a cold dark summer day?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We would create a mountain of ice and salt that would store water
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; making it more hospitable to those who have a lotta money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Has this idea been proposed before?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know, but this brings up an idea: What impact upon ocean sea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels has the Russian redirecting of rivers away from the Caspian and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aral seas done? If water flows were corrected, would this mitigate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rising sea levels?
</em><br>
<p>Ok, after researching this, It turns out the Caspian Sea has risen some
<br>
2.25 meters since 1978 (it had previously dropped 1.77 meters between
<br>
1933 and 1978) and is risking some coastal damage, however, its surface
<br>
is still 28 meters below sea level. With a surface area of 373,000
<br>
square km, and another 100,000 sq km of adjacent land below sea level,
<br>
this results in 1.15 x 10^13 cubic meters of volume below sea level
<br>
available for flooding. This flooding should provide 10 cm of worldwide
<br>
sea level lowering. If we wanted to we could pump an additional 200
<br>
meters of sea water up to the Caspian Sea from the Black Sea, which
<br>
would cover about 600,000 sq km and lower oceanic sea levels by at least
<br>
a meter.
<br>
<p>Now, if we covered the area in a big space blanket, how quickly could we
<br>
freeze that water into ice for storage?
