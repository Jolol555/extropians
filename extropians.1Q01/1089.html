<em>&gt;&gt; No harm done, but your cure seems about as abusive to the list as the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Getting a long delay in an answer is useful intelligence, and an

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;While I admit I participated in baiting him, it was merely providing him
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the rope he hung himself with (once again), despite my best efforts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in trying to caution him against his folly. This time, not only did he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spam and flame the list (once again), but we documented him lying and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being hypocritical (and continued in this behavior after it was pointed

</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather clear to all and sundry that

<em>&gt;Mr Joe Dees is a troll, an extremist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with significant problems restraining himself verbally and a lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;connection to reality, and a lack of ability to tell the truth, who sees
</em><br>
<em>&gt;himself as a martyr of some sort, who will appoint himself as list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crusader and defender of the faith
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Mikey here demonstrates his true ability to psychologically project his own traits upon others.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (despite being the one who was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;previously kicked off the list, while I was not, contrary to his claims,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and despite nobody I know of asking him to do so).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Despite my best efforts of encouragement, list members insist on talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about that dreaded subject on this list. I won't stoop to the rude and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obnoxious methods Mr. Dees engages in, being the libertarian that I am.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It seems to me that the market is speaking. Is anyone hearing?
