<p><em>&gt; Here is a message I got from the list owner of the primary NE North

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<p>This is too bad, and is the type of absolutist reactionary response I am opposed to. But then,
<br>
I went to the links they provided and saw how young these guys are, so I can (at least in
<br>
theory) cut them a little slack (for now). Taking absolutist positions is often a way for
<br>
people to find self-definition (we all do it, in varying degrees, throughout our lives), and
<br>
when young and exposed to the idea that the world we've been handed ain't what it seems . . .
<br>
well, to me these kind of reactions are normal and healthy (but are not the same for everyone,
<br>
of course). I'd rather see these guys involved in this kind of activity than becoming
<br>
neo-nazis. You do see that they are at least identifying some of the same problems? I see this
<br>
as a good thing, but then I like to find common ground among people. And I'm somewhat
<br>
optimistic that the critical thinking that obviously lies beneath all the posturing will
<br>
someday develop into something important and useful (at least to the people involved, if
<br>
nothing else). It's a shame they felt it necessary to kick you off the list, as I think you
<br>
could provide them with an interesting perspective. But, like I said, I'm an optimist.

<p><p><em>&gt; A corporation has no legal power to use force to make you buy their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product, pay them extortion money, or die in their service. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation cannot shoot you out of hand without any repercussions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Governments can do all of these. What powers corporations do have that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do get abused are only granted to them by the monopoly on the market of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force that government has. End that monopoly and you end both government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AND corporate abuses. Follow the power. Where is it most concentrated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In government.
</em><br>
<p>This is only true in theory. In practice, there is plenty of evidence that corporations do
<br>
engage in such unhealthy activities as coercion, bribery, murder and genocide. You don't need a
<br>
government to hire thugs and mercenaries to do your dirty work. And if you own the media, the
<br>
police, and the government, who exactly can make sure there are repercussions for your actions?
<br>
And with no government of any kind, who is going to stop corporate gangs from doing whatever
<br>
they want? Again, I'm not saying that the corporation is inherently bad, or that all
<br>
corporations are engaging in these activities, just that some are and do. The only reason power
<br>
appears to be the most concentrated in government is because that's what the powers that be
<br>
want us to see. If the US government (for example) actually reflected the will of the people
<br>
(as it is supposed to do in theory), and if the people were truly informed and cared about what
<br>
was going in their own backyards and the world, then maybe these abuses couldn't take place. I
<br>
don't know. Perhaps this is too much to hope for.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ah, yes, and thanks to imperialism, 1/4 of the human race is no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burning its wives to death when their spouses die. I don't see that as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative process.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, but the ethnocentric position of your argument sounds like a rationalization for
<br>
oppression to me. Oddly enough, this is similar to the rationalization used by Christian
<br>
missionaries, i.e. that these people were not living correctly and it's our job to better their
<br>
lives and help them see the light. What hogwash. It's easy to pluck the most extreme examples
<br>
(and, frankly, not very good ones) out of the air to justify something that has already
<br>
happened. I'm just not buying it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Thanks to imperialism, despotic insular states like Japan and China
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opened up and modernized. Thanks to imperialism, four of the ten most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable nations on earth exist entirely due to colonization.
</em><br>
<p>And at what price to the people who didn't want what the white gods had to offer? This is so
<br>
shortsighted and arrogant it almost defies belief. How can you claim to be a libertarian when
<br>
it appears you think it's okay to selectively apply liberty? How exactly has colonization
<br>
improved the lives of native Americans?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Local opposition to 'imperialism' is typically a matter of one despot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his henchmen getting pissed off that they aren't allowed to abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their serfs like they used to.
</em><br>
<p>Only to become serfs of the imperialists. This is a circular argument, and not a very good one.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 2000-3000 years is nothing to evolution, and 'culture' is a thin veneer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that typically dissapears entirely with sufficient stress.
</em><br>
<p>Despite the evidence that this happens (I won't dispute it), I don't share your rather dark
<br>
view of humanity. While culture is often a thin veneer, it's really all we have (of course, I'm
<br>
including science and technology under this rubric) to separate us from the other animals. And
<br>
enough, if we have the strength of character to use it wisely.
