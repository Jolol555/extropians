Robin writes, regarding the cypherpunk concept of undermining
<br>
the state via online communications:
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't think this will work.  See: <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/privacy.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/privacy.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether physical control is extended into the virtual world seems a tossup.
</em><br>
<p>I need to give credit to Robin for discussing this collision between
<br>
less privacy in the physical world and potentially more privacy online,
<br>
long before my article.  I think I was unconsciously borrowing from his
<br>
analysis when I wrote mine.
<br>
<p>Robin is pessimistic about the more extreme variants on the cypherpunk
<br>
model, as where someone works online in virtual reality but maintains
<br>
anonymity via technical means (filters to change appearance and
<br>
mannerisms, cryptography and mixes to hide message paths).  He points out
<br>
the many subtle ways in which information can leak between virtual and
<br>
physical identities, and also notes that the technology for anonymous
<br>
online communication depends ultimately on equipment in the physical
<br>
world, where it can be restricted.
<br>
<p>I don't know how far it will go, but I think we will begin to see
<br>
movement towards online anonymity (of which there has been little so
<br>
far).  One motivation will be the new online file sharing technologies
<br>
like Napster.  Napster users have been identified and sanctioned (so
<br>
far just by being banned, but in principle they could be prosecuted).
<br>
Future systems are attempting to build in more privacy so that people
<br>
can participate anonymously.  We also have had a number of cases in
<br>
which people got in trouble for bulletin board postings, and it may be
<br>
that people will learn that you should never post anything on a system
<br>
where your identity can be tracked, if you don't want to be sued.
<br>
These factors will provide gentle social pressure to push us towards
<br>
adoption of anonymity technologies.
<br>
<p>However it is a long way from that to a cypherpunk-style collapse of
<br>
governments.  Still I think it will be important for there to be continued
<br>
social acceptance and recognition of the value of anonymity and privacy.
<br>
<p>Freedom of communications is crucially important in a world where
<br>
physical privacy is greatly reduced.  We have seen many times that
<br>
control of the press and of the flow of information is a necessary part
<br>
of a despotic state.  With an unfettered internet free of state control
<br>
there is no way that an unpopular government can retain legitimacy.
<br>
(This is why China is so threatened by the net, and I believe that this
<br>
technology will ultimately play an important role in changing China over
<br>
the next couple of decades.)
<br>
<p>So what I expect is that we will continue to have democratic governments
<br>
much as we have today, implementing degrees of restrictiveness that match
<br>
majority desires.  The cameras aren't going to go away, but we won't
<br>
see an Orwellian dictatorship.  We will have public monitoring, but it
<br>
will be used to enforce laws which are supported by a populace which is
<br>
fully informed of their effects and engages in vigorous public debate.
<br>
<p>We will have strong and effective laws against violent crime.  Whether
<br>
victimless crimes like prostitution and drug use are enforced will
<br>
depend on the majority views.  As evidence is gathered and digested,
<br>
the public will come to adopt informed opinions on whether criminalizing
<br>
these practices does harm or good.
<br>
<p>In the online world, I believe that the use of anonymity and pseudonyms
<br>
will become commonplace and accepted.  Few will attempt to reach
<br>
cypherpunk levels of paranoia, and most people will be comfortable with
<br>
their real-life friends learning their online identities (most of them
<br>
anyway...).  Rather than destroying governments as in the cypherpunk
<br>
model, I see the net as exerting a moderating influence.  As long as
<br>
people are able to talk freely and know what is going on in the world
<br>
around them, they will be able to keep control over the state.
<br>
