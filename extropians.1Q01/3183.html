<p>This kinda problem is easily solved with a video camera which
<br>
has a transmitter so that the recording device is not on the person
<br>
and so cannot be confiscated.  The real trick is to make a standard
<br>
video camera with a transmitter.
<br>
<p>After the cops learn of the existence of transmitter cameras that
<br>
look like standard ones, they would be unable to tell the difference
<br>
and wouldnt wanna chance it, so anyone with any camera would
<br>
cause them to play by the rules.
<br>
<p>Then the next logical step is a camera too small to be seen.
<br>
Then no one knows who is packing tape.  A polite society
<br>
results.  Of course it makes one a little squicked when one
<br>
showers in the locker room.  But why should it?  Why did
<br>
we evolve the instinct to cover our private parts and why
<br>
should we keep that today?  spike
