<p>This is the type of narrow-minded pigeonholing I have a problem with. Nothing is this
<br>
plain and simple. I voted for a candidate, not a party. I am not a registered Green
<br>
and don't intend to be. I think that party affiliations are limiting. By your
<br>
reasoning, I must also be a libertarian, since I have voted for libertarian
<br>
candidates on numerous occasions and am likely to do so in the future. Try to broaden
<br>
your horizons a little. Think outside the box.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; b) saying whiny little playground things like 'Bush isn't the legitimate

</em><br>
<p>Oh, and this response is somehow mature? Uh huh.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Considering that most shenanigans were beneficial to Gore and he STILL

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves a little turnaround.
</em><br>
<p>So, by your own reasoning, this makes you a republican, not a libertarian. I'm
<br>
confused here. And speaking of honesty, to campaign for one candidate and then vote
<br>
for another makes you as sneaky as the &quot;sneaky little dems&quot; you obviously so despise.
<br>
Maybe you need to take a long hard look at yourself.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'm frankly rather tired and exasperated with anyone who claims that 'Bush stole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the election'.
</em><br>
<p>And I'm absolutely tired and exaxperated with anyone who claims the election was
<br>
somehow honest. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anyone who says that either paid absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no attention to the election and post-election, or else they just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted the DNC party line about what happened.
</em><br>
<p>Since I have as much disregard for the DNC as I do for the GOP, this is hardly
<br>
likely. You are the one who is admitting to a partisan bias here, not me. Just
<br>
because I criticize one side for something they did doesn't mean I support the other
<br>
side. This is (again) the type of black and white thinking I am rejecting here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In either case, saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is nothing more or less than whining. Get over it. Thats not name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling, thats calling it like it is. Get over it, grow up, and pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention.
</em><br>
<p>You call it whining, I call it simply expressing my opinion. And I'm sure I pay much
<br>
more attention to these things than you do, as evidenced by your cliched and obvious
<br>
party-line responses.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Read the news paper. Watch news in depth and don't listen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the big three networks. Between CNN and FOX you can generally get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture about what goes on. CNN is leftist, FOX is a bit to the right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; C-SPAN is probably the only source of unjudgemental political news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around.
</em><br>
<p>Since I've never once told you where I get my information from, it's odd you would
<br>
make this assumption. I never pay attention to the so-called major news networks,
<br>
particularly CNN, but am a big fan of C-SPAN. The fact that you would call any of the
<br>
&quot;big boys&quot; (particularly CNN) leftist suggests to me that it is you who is not paying
<br>
attention. And Fox is &quot;a bit to the right&quot;? Please. Follow the power. Look at who
<br>
owns it.
