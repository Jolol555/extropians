&quot;The problem is that many of these groups don't consider logic to be
<br>
as important as &quot;we&quot; do.  Logic is only a convenient tool, to be used
<br>
when possible, but to be discarded when that logic might upset one of
<br>
their core beliefs.&quot;
<br>
<p>Can you prove anything logically without eventually bumping into an axiom 
<br>
that requires you to have faith in it? Your logic has as many flaws as has 
<br>
the fundamentalist christians' faith. Theirs' just seem more shocking 
<br>
because they don't make any effort in hiding the faith-related parts.
