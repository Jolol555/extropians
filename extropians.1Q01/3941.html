Hi. Will have to reply in pieces. See below. **

<em>&gt; Granted, the 1998 FBI UCR does not specifically track officers shot but not

</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, if you refer to page 31 of the reference document (URL below) &quot;Law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforcement Officers Feloniously Killed and Assaulted&quot; I think we can safely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infer that being shot and living counts as a felonious assault, yes?
</em><br>
<p>**Sorry; no. During many years in New York, for example, more police 
<br>
officers were shot (and killed, I believe) by fellow officers than by 
<br>
criminals. This occurs largely for reasons of mistaken identity--
<br>
you've got multiple overlapping agency jurisdictions, plainclothes 
<br>
responders, etc. Call comes in &quot;man with a gun.&quot; cop sees man with a 
<br>
gun and shoots him--and he turns out to be a brother officer. These 
<br>
cases are statistically significant.
<br>
<p>**Less statistically significant are a few cases wherein a bozo cop 
<br>
shoots himself or another cop by accident (AD, etc.) and reports it 
<br>
as an attack to avoid embarrassment/rubber gun squad.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(Can
<br>
<em>&gt; any legal type comment or rebut that?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You will see that of the 623,887 assaults on law enforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officers(remember that includes federal agents as well) only 9.4% ocurred at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a traffic stop.
</em><br>
<p>**Ooh. Looks bad. but uhmm--how many occurred SUBSEQUENT to traffic 
<br>
stops? Ex.--Cop stops bozo, bozo runs or speeds away and later shoots 
<br>
cop. Technically that will not go down as a traffic stop shoot--but 
<br>
that's where it started.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;The highest category for assaults, but not killings, is
<br>
<em>&gt; disturbance calls at 31.8%
</em><br>
<p>**Oh yeah. Arrest hubby and guess who plants a knife in your back?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Question for a lawyer: Is shooting someone (not accidentally) automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempted murder?]
</em><br>
<p>**Absolutely not. Even shooting a cop, intentionally, is not 
<br>
automatically a felony--though rest assured it will be prosecuted as 
<br>
one. Cops are just like anyone else--they have their share of 
<br>
rapists/murderers/etc. Once in a while they get shot in the process. 
<br>
Another situation--cops break into the wrong house on a no-knock; 
<br>
homeowner opens fire in the dark, or on masked men coming at him with 
<br>
guns. He has a legitimate self-defense argument, if he survives 
<br>
(which is unlikely). Some jurisdictions also specifically permit 
<br>
resistance to unlawful arrest with lethal force. (The majority, 
<br>
however, hold that citizens must submit to unlawful arrests--not good 
<br>
if the arresting officer turns out to be a nutjob.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we can conclude, based on this publically available data, that MOST cops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are NOT shot at traffic stops nor are MOST cops killed at traffic stops.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About 1/3rd of cops killed are killed attempting to arrest someone.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single greatest source of Officer Assaults (on them) is while responding to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a disturbance call. (admittedly a very broad category and there is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case to argue that many &quot;disturbace calls&quot; turn into an &quot;arrest situation&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would therefore submit that Mr. Marlow is incorrect in his original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertions, but may have a point that #1, the way the numbers are broken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down does not tell the whole story and #2, that certain subsets of &quot;Law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Enforcement Officers&quot; (the California Highway Patrol comes to mind) may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed have dramatically different numbers than the aggregate totals shown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the cited reference.
</em><br>
<p>**Could &quot;I&quot; be WRONG?
<br>
Hmmm. Let me mull that one over.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;;)
<br>
<p><p>**UCR #s are screwy. Example: deaths 'caused' by handguns. Been a few 
<br>
years since I kept up on those stats--but used to be, these were not 
<br>
broken down. HUGE number of those are suicides. Many more are 
<br>
civilians lawfully killing criminal attackers. But it's all lumped 
<br>
together, or used to be. HCI adores stats like that.
