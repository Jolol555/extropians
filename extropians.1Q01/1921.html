<p>I notice you did not bother to deal with any of the arguments raised
<br>
against MS products and environments.  Why?  Do you think it is right
<br>
just to call us &quot;purists&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What can I say? I love GUIs, I don't love command lines. I've been a unix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admin, and a unix developer, and my rather drawn out degree involved all
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; passion (a vms man). There used to be a time when unix was seen as a cobbled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together joke of an operating system, compared to the state of the art.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Really? Compared to what?  Surely not compared to Windows which to this
<br>
day cannot even deal with multiple users correctly.  VMS was halfway
<br>
decent.  More than halfway.  I greatly miss its System Services and
<br>
Runtime Library.  But you won't find those things in Windows. Its
<br>
command language was rather a poor joke though.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, I've been working with MS stuff for years now. I love it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I love the win32 world. It's pretty. Some of the variants are even halfway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decent operating systems. The tools are wonderful. The finished products are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful.
</em><br>
<p>A bit of pretty GUI level stuff is enough heh?  What about the broken
<br>
Basic environment?  What of the quite poorly constructed MFC?  DLLs are
<br>
really nice, but they were much better in OS2 which is a much superior
<br>
operating system to Windoze to this day.  Which tools are wonderful? 
<br>
The C++ environment?  It is more or less acceptable as an IDE except
<br>
that it produces massive bloat and takes hours to compile decent sized
<br>
projects and doesn't give anywehre near adequate reflection or
<br>
cross-cutting abilities.  And since MS doesn't really support file
<br>
soft-links it is a bit of a problem sharing build components among
<br>
members of a team. Visual Basic I already talked a bit about. J++, MS
<br>
attempt to steal Java in front of everyone, with an interface straight
<br>
out of Visual Basic?  Is this your idea of a wonderful tool?  How many
<br>
tools have you actually worked with?  Do you know Smalltalk and Lisp
<br>
IDEs (back when they were still common)?  Exactly what are you comparing
<br>
to? Only the command line?  But the CLI has all the power despite not
<br>
being friedly.  GUIs are nice, don't get me wrong, but they only do what
<br>
the designer of the GUI driven interface set them up to do.  Oh yes, you
<br>
may be able to add to it with a Visual Basic subset. But that is very
<br>
little compared to having true access to the entire environment the GUI
<br>
elements were build from as you do in Smalltalk and some of the Lisp
<br>
IDEs.  But if you want to produce COM components (which I admit are a
<br>
good thing generally although not as good imho as CORBA) then you have
<br>
to go write them in some other language, usually C++, rather than the
<br>
much touted VS Basic.  Yes, .net may/will change this.  But it is rather
<br>
too little, too late.  And all of these tools are owned and locked tight
<br>
by MS, which quite clearly does not have the best interests of
<br>
programmers or the software world in general as a major goal. That they
<br>
are closed up means many of the best minds will not get a chance to
<br>
build from them unless they sell out to the great MS.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other than my pro MS bias, and a deep affection for Borland's Delphi, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have any particular alliegance to products/languages/etc. Whatever is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to get the job done. It's the thing you are trying to achieve, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tools you use to achieve it with.
</em><br>
<p>There is not one tool in Delphi or MS that has not been done and done
<br>
better in Lisp and Smalltalk ages ago.  COM components and components
<br>
generally come close but that was taken straight (well actually very
<br>
round-about) from DEC DCE protocol and was MS attempting to define
<br>
itself separate from the rest of the world and true component
<br>
interoperability using CORBA.  The couldn't own CORBA and sure weren't
<br>
going to offer any bridges to it.  Not that CORBA is pretty either.  I
<br>
actually don't like either of them technically as much as a distributed
<br>
object messaging system and environment I invented in 1985-1987. 
<br>
Unfortunately it was about five years before its time and was invented
<br>
as a sideline to a company's main line of business.  They ended up
<br>
owning the technology and had no idea what to do with it.  A lesson I
<br>
will not soon forget.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A final bit of ranting... while lots of people have said that ASP/IIS/ETC is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bad way to go (and even bad from a saleable job skills sense, weird),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone's been putting forward a different point of view. I would put it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you all that none of us has the big picture. The IT world is truly immense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these days; is it just possible that each of us is dwelling in his/her own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private little (very large) world, and not considering views/truths from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside that domain?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I look at it differently.  It is up to moral programmers with
<br>
a vision of how we could do things far better than we do now to choose
<br>
the tools that they believe are the best and to use those successfully
<br>
on enough projects to give them continuing life and dominance and to
<br>
make room to develop the next set of tools and the next after that until
<br>
we develop tools that take over their own development largely.  I got
<br>
into this business to change the world, not just to give this or that
<br>
company what some manager is asking for today.  I and others like me are
<br>
not done yet.
