It appears as if Michael Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mike@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20International%20Forum%20on%20Globalization%20-%20More%20suitablefor%20Halloween%20th...&In-Reply-To=&lt;200102091002.LAA23615@color.sics.se&gt;">mike@datamann.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<p>I fully agree with the above quoted material, as it matches my empirical
<br>
data on how the vast majority of humans do function. I also agree with
<br>
the passage on communism/socialism, having done empirical studies of it
<br>
in the real world. Bluntly, communism/socialism does not work, due to
<br>
inherent flaws in its structure. It lacks freedom from oppression.
