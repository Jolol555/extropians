<em>&gt; &gt; It's really not what you'd call a &quot;fast&quot; movie, y'know.  2001 dates from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  time when movies were much, much more slower-paced.  That sequence at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  end alone... trying to watch &quot;2001&quot; after &quot;The Matrix&quot; is like trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  watch &quot;Psycho&quot; after &quot;Hellraiser II&quot;.  You sit there and just marvel at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  the idea that this was once cutting-edge; that people could think of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  movie as being anything but homey, wholesome, and relaxing.  You do it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  the historical value and to just appreciate how different things must have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  been a couple of generations ago.  If 2001 were released today, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  flop.  How can you demand of my generation that they watch it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That &quot;2001&quot; would be a flop if it were released
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today is not necessarily a GOOD thing.
</em><br>
<p>The exact footage would be a flop if released.  If &quot;2001&quot; were recreated
<br>
today by people of equal talent, it would be a better movie.  &quot;2003&quot;
<br>
&lt;grin&gt; wouldn't be a great innovative movie because it would no longer
<br>
have the capacity to shock and enlighten the audience, but it would be
<br>
more fun to watch than &quot;2001&quot;.  If you then sent &quot;2003&quot; back in time to
<br>
the original release date, it would be a _killer_ movie.  Audience members
<br>
would be flopping around on movie theatre floors, their untrained nervous
<br>
systems destroyed by the sheer power of the movie.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some things - say, telling a story
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that encompasses the sweep of 4 million years of deep time - can't be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly, or at least not done well.  Imagine trying to tell the story of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;2001&quot; MTV-style.  Now consider whether we should uncritically embrace every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural change, when it may carry with it the inevitable loss of artistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vocabulary to express important ideas.  Consider taking a pit stop during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race into the future to stop and smell some roses from ages gone by.
</em><br>
<p>An Extropian truth:  Things improve with time.  Not automatically, and
<br>
sometimes there are worse things as well as better things as you move into
<br>
the future.  I don't know of any modern composer who has yet beat Bach at
<br>
his own game - kind of surprising, really - and nineties music may not be
<br>
superior to eighties music, but eighties music is far superior to
<br>
seventies music.  Someone who prefers eighties music to nineties music
<br>
isn't necessarily an old fogey; I grew up in the nineties and I still like
<br>
eighties &quot;oldies&quot; music better.  But if you prefer sixties music to
<br>
eighties music, then, I'm sorry, but you're getting OLD OLD OLD.  So
<br>
unless you can get Ziana Astralos to override me on this &quot;2001&quot; issue...
<br>
<p>I own a copy of the Lensman series, but the only reason that the series is
<br>
readable at all is because it was written long, long ago, back when it was
<br>
possible to be a talented writer and still have two-dimensional characters
<br>
with the emotional maturity of flatworms.  If _Lensman_ were written
<br>
today, it would be badly spelled, full of grammatical errors, and have a
<br>
meandering or nonexistent plotline, because only a really lousy author
<br>
could write _Lensman_ today.  I don't know what doc Smith would have been
<br>
if he were alive today, but however interesting his old corpus is as
<br>
adult-readable children's-fiction good-old-days SF, it doesn't come
<br>
remotely close to Greg Egan.
<br>
<p>_Lensman_ is interesting to diehard SF fans, and it was groundbreaking in
<br>
its time, but it's no longer good SF.  It's SF that used to be excellent,
<br>
which is a strange and terrible thing to behold.  The quality is there,
<br>
the art is there, the love is there, the intelligence and wit is there,
<br>
and yet it looks like something that a nine-year-old would turn in as a
<br>
homework assignment.
<br>
<p>Insofar as art is *real*, insofar as art is true quality and excellence,
<br>
and not just a herd of critics agreeing with each other, then yesterday's
<br>
art will sometimes become one with the typewriter and the slide rule.
