<p><p>Really?  Haven't been paying attention to the various implants on the

markets have you?  How long do you think it will be before wearable

computers hit big-time and become a natural part of how people live

their waking lives?  Turning them off when you have integrated these

modalities into your being and extended your senses, memory and so on
<br>
with them will be very much like being involuntarily dumbed down.

<p>You are waxing status quo, not realistic.  Something I didn't expect
