Hayflick does not &quot;know it all&quot; when it comes to life-extension.  I've 
<br>
learned to not try to reason with overconfident people, I just ignore them.  
<br>
By coincidence, I have beside me a copy of a 7- point letter written in 1877 
<br>
by a &quot;technical committee&quot;  explaining why the telephone will never be 
<br>
commonplace in private homes.  Also I remember a television show about Robert 
<br>
Fulton -- so many thought he was crazy for believing he could make a boat 
<br>
that runs on steam.  Similar for many other possibilities.  Life extension is 
<br>
a more difficult endeavor than inventing something mechanical but as said by 
<br>
a hematologist I recently was evaluated by &quot;aging is a process and any 
<br>
process can be interfered with&quot;.  (I think I'll always remember his exact 
<br>
words.)
