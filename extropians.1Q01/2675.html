<p>I have seen this idea in other places. I like it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How about this:  One can take a test for one's self, submit one's car to

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraction of the limits of your combined car and driver rating under the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;road system, such as tire pressure and temperature, lateral acceleration,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;excessive yaw, vibration and aerodynamic downforce.  Exceeding the car's

</em><br>
<p>So you could tear down a road with blind curves, and not have to worry 
<br>
about obstructions just out of sight, perhaps..
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Under the such a system, there are lots of places

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;windows on my car tend to blow out from Bornoulli Effect above c. 200 mph;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Are you serious? What holds the windows in there in the first place?
