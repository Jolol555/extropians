I would think that the rational solution would be to expand the time
<br>
available. The current agriculturally based school year is outdated in the
<br>
first place. Why not year-round school?

<em>&gt; &gt; reporting the declining position of the United States in world trade in

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Part of the problem might be that a long run of good times has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a certain extent demotivated students.  Even the slouches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manage to find adequate employment.  We are to a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent victims of our own success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the New York Telephone Company reported that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;it tested 57,000 job applicants in 1987 and found that 54,900, or 96.3%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lacked basic skills in math, reading, and reasoning.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, but they are likely getting the bottom of the barrel applicants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (35) A human resource
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; planning document prepared at the Bank of America in 1990 reported that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Chemical Bank in New York must interview 40 applicants to find one who
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be successfully trained as a teller&quot;;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, the better qualified applicants are not looking to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bank tellers.  Who aspires to compete with ATMs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (36) &quot;at Pacific Bell in Los Angeles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 95% of the 3,500 people who recently took a competency test for
</em><br>
entry-level
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; jobs not requiring a high school education failed&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would certainly agree that the US educational system is failing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Almost one-quarter of high school seniors could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accurately determine the cost of a simple meal from a short menu of
</em><br>
items
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and prices,(42) and fewer than half &quot;demonstrated a consistent grasp of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decimals, percents, fractions, and simple algebra.&quot;(43)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an area that has long been debated.  Schools are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to teach additional skills in addition to the ones taught 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yrs ago, such as computer competency.  The total amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time in class has not changed.  So what should be dropped off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the curriculum?  The most common thing has been math
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills, with the notion that having computer skills will somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compensate for the loss.  What isnt fully understood is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study of mathematics trains the mind in logic and clear thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Max, being an educator, this must cause you countless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; headaches, eh?  spike
