</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for Mr dees &lt;PLONK&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Brian,
<br>
<p>You said you wanted to call attention to this post, so you got it.
<br>
<p>In reviewing the actual posting from Joe Dees, I find that you have 
<br>
misrepresented the history.  Mike Lorrey actually introduced the 
<br>
topic of guns.  Joe Dees was responding to Mike's earlier message.
<br>
<p>Joe's original message made it abundantly clear that he was 
<br>
responding to a previous post.  He quoted Mike Lorrey's words and 
<br>
then gave his response.  When you wanted to draw attention to Joe's 
<br>
post, you quoted it out of context.  You edited out Mike's earlier 
<br>
words, left only Joe's words, and then claimed that Joe started it.
<br>
<p>This simply did not happen the way you presented it.  Your editing of 
<br>
the previous post left out critical details that would have 
<br>
contradicted your claim.  Both your claim and your edited quotation 
<br>
misrepresent the true sequence of events.  Please be more careful in 
<br>
the future.

<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; I'm curious as to what you saw that was unfair about the election.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  An admission that a measurement has an error, and the realization that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  a measurement without an error bar wouldn't survive even a trace of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  peer scrutiny. That apart from the obvious cases of &quot;candidate A won&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  or &quot;candidate B won&quot; or &quot;candidate C won&quot; there's also &quot;within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  error margins, we can't tell, so it's a tie&quot;, and a procedere for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  resolving such. As flipping an unbiased coin, or a public duel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  or whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Apart from that, anything with a &quot;democracy&quot; somewhere in it is supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  to represent the meaning of majority of voters. Not representatives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  such, or some d'Hondtian games with numbers. Not to open the can of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  worms of basis democracy vs. elitism...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a) we're not a democracy, we are a republic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;b) we are not a democracy, we are a republic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;c) we are not a democracy, we are a republic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, what did I miss?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oh, yeah, simple majorities here can't:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change the constitution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;override a veto
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comdemn a man to death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;declare martial law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change the law after the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and, elect a president and vice president
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Supreme Court satisfied the 'flipping the coin' part, by deciding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that Gore cheated by trying to change the coin to a two headed one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mid-toss, so Bush won by default.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, I wouldn't have minded much if they had duelled, tho I 'spect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gore woulda demanded three people as seconds, bragged that he invented
</em><br>
<em>&gt;duelling and thus gets to decide the rules AFTER having walked ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paces, denied the referee had any controlling and legal authority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tipper would have demanded that videos of the duel carry warning labels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gore would have denied ever having smoked a barrel ('cept maybe once),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the press would have declared Gore the winner before a shot was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fired.
