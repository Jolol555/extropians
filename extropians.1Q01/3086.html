<em>&gt; Subject: Re: ECON: Lack of skilled people in the USA
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It made me mad when I was in high
<br>
<em>&gt; school. I watched people's minds getting shut down.  Needlessly.
</em><br>
<p>It made me mad too, and it makes me mad seeing the same thing happening to
<br>
my daughter's friends now (I like to think it isn't happening as much to my
<br>
daughter, because her father and I both encourage her to understand things
<br>
rather than memorize formulas, and she seems to insist on this even if it
<br>
means more work for her--for example in a computer programming class
<br>
recently all the other kids were cheating, passing around a solution for a
<br>
test, but my daughter refused to look at it, saying that if she did so she'd
<br>
be cheating herself out of the opportunity to figure it out on her own)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I will have to do some teaching.
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to see more &quot;non-teachers&quot; in elementary and intermediate school
<br>
classrooms. It seems that ideally, subjects should be presented by people
<br>
who know them well and are enthusiastic about them. When I used to teach
<br>
botany to the kids in my daughter's classes, they'd listen as intently as if
<br>
they were watching their favorite TV show, because I was passionately
<br>
interested in the subject.
<br>
<p>If you don't need the money, you can teach as a volunteer and thus bypass
<br>
requirements for taking &quot;education&quot; classes (I must confess I've never taken
<br>
an education class, but from talking to people who have, I gather they're
<br>
mostly boring and not of much practical use). I've found that one can do a
<br>
lot of good by putting in just a few hours per week. Not only can you help
<br>
out the kids in this way, you also find out first-hand what's going on in
<br>
the schools.
<br>
