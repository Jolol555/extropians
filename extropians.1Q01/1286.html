<em>&gt; This is why your methods are so offensive to the rest of the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your goals (in this case only) do not match the goals of the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are spamming hundreds of extropians with messages that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really directed to them, but are part of your master plan.  You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using this list, not for extropian conversation, but for political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maneuvering to catch an opponent in a political position.  The rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us on this list are not oblivious to your machinations.  We have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been forced to endure this entire episode intermixed with our list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data stream, knowing full well that it was not directed toward us or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to list business.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your on-topic posts are certainly interesting and welcome!  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think I speak for many on this list when I ask that you not involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us or this list in your political battles in the future.  Postings to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list should only be made for the benefit of the list members and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be limited to discussion of extropian ideas.  Other usages of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list outside its intended purpose is a form of abuse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please consider this position the next time you find yourself in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar situation in the future.
</em><br>
<p>I completely understand the list members stress related to this, and
<br>
nobody can say I have not tried to move this discussion to the
<br>
exi-freedom list repeatedly, which he has refused to do. I personally do
<br>
not consider shutting him down by identifying his lies, extremism, and
<br>
hypocrisies publicly to be spamming the list so long as the list is
<br>
willing to continue to tolerate his willfull lying, extremism and
<br>
hypocrisy. I have placed him back in the trashbin, so as long as the
<br>
rest of you are willing to tolerate and buy into his BS, you are welcome
<br>
to him.
<br>
&quot;Societies get the government they deserve&quot; and all that rot. Societies
<br>
that prefer high crime to individual liberty will get just that, and
<br>
lists that prefer mentally unstable individuals posting rants and
<br>
excretory comments demonizing other list members will get a list full of
<br>
just that sort of person.
