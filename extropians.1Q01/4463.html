Enslaving 10% of the population 100% of the time is no different than
<br>
enslaving 100% of the population 10% of the time.
<br>
Where are the dating instructions for women?
<br>
People who practice sedition against the Constitution are justifiably
<br>
persecuted and prosecuted. I suggest you read about the Venona Files
<br>
before you continue claiming there was no communist infiltration.
<br>
Yes Jim Crow laws were wrong, especially those Jim Crow laws that
<br>
prevented blacks from defending themselves. Now many more tens of
<br>
millions of Americans suffer under such laws which are now color blind
<br>
in their repression. Their color blindness does not make them just.
<br>
&quot;Socially conformed and politically silenced&quot; is not the same as
<br>
disenfranchised or never enfranchised. Women LEGALLY, Constitutionally,
<br>
could not vote, so it was not 'injustice'.

<em>&gt; Good point, Loree. I also like the part where he says, &quot;If you think critically about a denomination, it does not make you anti-religion.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just so happens, Mr. Heston, that I AM anti-religion. You got a problem wit dat?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also was surprised to read his claim that we &quot;are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.&quot; Huh? That's high grade poppycock. I would be surprised that Heston would say that considering he lived to see the repression that existed in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, when the USA hounded dissidents, denied them passports and jobs, planted false rumors and kept a large portion of the black population without even the power to vote. And that's not even addressing all of the oppression that was inflicted upon various peoples in previous eras. Now when did women get the vote? Kind of puts his complaints about occasional abuses of political correctness into a different perspective. He's complaining about college men getting dating instructions? Cry me a river!
