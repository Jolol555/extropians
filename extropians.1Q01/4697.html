Subject: New Discovery May Impact Computers
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a startling result, scientists have found that a common metal  
<br>
compound can carry electricity with virtually no resistance at a 
<br>
higher temperature than previously thought possible. The compound 
<br>
might become useful for building superfast computers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two labs report that the magnesium-boron compound becomes  
<br>
``superconducting'' at temperatures of around minus 388 degrees to 
<br>
minus 389 degrees. That is still mighty cold, but it is warmer than 
<br>
the previous record for simple metallic compounds of about minus 
<br>
418. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since superconducting compounds must be chilled to work,  
<br>
scientists are eager to find materials that work at higher, more 
<br>
easily attained temperatures. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new work will be reported in next Thursday's issue of the  
<br>
journal Nature by Jun Akimitsu of the Aoyama-Gakuin University in 
<br>
Tokyo with colleagues, and in next Monday's issue of Physical 
<br>
Review Letters by Paul Canfield and colleagues at the Ames 
<br>
Laboratory and the department of physics and astronomy at Iowa 
<br>
State University. Canfield's group followed up on Akimitsu's work. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese work was startling because the superconductivity  
<br>
temperature was so much higher than ever observed in such metallic 
<br>
compounds, Robert Cava of Princeton University wrote in a Nature 
<br>
commentary. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``The field of superconductivity has been rocked'' by the news,  
<br>
he said. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cava said superconductivity researchers have virtually ignored  
<br>
such simple metallic compounds for 15 years in favor of a class of 
<br>
oxygen-containing materials, which superconduct at much higher 
<br>
temperatures than even the newly reported compound, up to minus 172 
<br>
degrees. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some experts said the magnesium-boron compound might pay off in  
<br>
making very fast computer components, where the oxygen-containing 
<br>
materials have proven hard to work with. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Rowell, a professor in materials science at Northwestern  
<br>
University, said scientists have done much work with 
<br>
lower-temperature materials like the metallic element niobium. If 
<br>
the magnesium-boron material could be used instead, the components 
<br>
might work as much as four times faster because of the higher 
<br>
superconducting temperature, he said. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noted that it is not clear whether the overall idea of  
<br>
superconducting electronics will prove useful in computers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ted Geballe, a superconductivity expert at Stanford University,  
<br>
said he gives the magnesium-boron material an outside chance of 
<br>
becoming useful in electronics, but he added that ``it's so new 
<br>
it's worth looking at.'' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cava, in his commentary, said superconducting materials based on  
<br>
the compound might one day be able to carry more current than wires 
<br>
made from the oxygen-bearing materials. Scientists hope 
<br>
superconducting wire will be able to routinely carry electricity 
<br>
without substantial losses to resistance.
