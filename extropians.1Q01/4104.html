<em>&gt; &gt; But for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some reason, consumers of regular chips don't seem to report this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; phenomenon while consumers of Olestra do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is because Olestra is a new product.  The media, or the attention of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world, is focused on it.  They don't care about the old chips - that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old news.  What is news is that their might be a dangerous side effect thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each case is news - is doesn't mean that it is significant.
</em><br>
<p>Plus, Olestra products have a warning on the package about gastrointestinal
<br>
upset and &quot;fecal staining&quot;.  Yum, pass me another handful of potato chips.
<br>
This warning will make people more likely to associate any tummy troubles
<br>
with the chips than if they had ordinary snacks.
<br>
<p>I've had Olestra chips a few times and haven't had any problems (for what
<br>
little that means).  But in general I've given up on snacking on fat and
<br>
sugar substitutes as a weight loss method.  It seems like I eventually
<br>
compensate for the lower calories by eating more.  For me it works better
<br>
to moderate my diet and keep my mind on eating lightly and healthily,
<br>
rather than pigging out on supposedly &quot;safe&quot; snacks.
