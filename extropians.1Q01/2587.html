<p>I appreciated the discussion, although I could have done without the 
<br>
repeated questioning of my motivations.  Despite some obvious cheap 
<br>
shots I could have taken, I tried very hard to discuss only the 
<br>
contrast of techniques and benefits/detriments, not the possible 
<br>
deficiencies in the practitioners of techniques with which I don't 
<br>
agree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Maybe by focusing on the libertarian ideal that one human should not

</em><br>
<em>&gt;common ground.
</em><br>
<p>:)  Maybe, maybe not.  Whenever people discuss the beautiful rights 
<br>
of libertarianism, I notice that they often gloss over the 
<br>
ramifications of the weighty responsibilities of libertarianism.
<br>
<p>If you're going to relate any libertarian rights to toddlers, you're 
<br>
also going to need to relate the corresponding responsibilities. 
<br>
Okay, force can't be initiated against the toddler.
<br>
<p>Does that include:
<br>
<p>- When he's wobbling out into traffic?
<br>
- When he's about to drink some Liquid Plumber(tm)?
<br>
- When he's found a locked and loaded gun with a hair trigger?
<br>
- When he wants to eat Winnie the Pooh(tm) candy at every meal?
<br>
- When he wants to shave his head and join an extropian cult?
<br>
<p>Children have a necessarily separate list of rights and 
<br>
responsibilities in our society.  This fact wouldn't likely change 
<br>
much in a libertarian society.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
