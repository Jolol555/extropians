</em><br>
<p>I like this one. :-D
<br>
<p>Then there's the technique described in a book that was required reading 
<br>
for a long-ago friend of mine when he got a job selling Encyclopedia 
<br>
Britannica. The title of the book was *The Art of Manipulation*; the author 
<br>
claimed it was a condensation of teachings he'd received from a seasoned 
<br>
con artist. When you must disagree with someone, he says, preface your 
<br>
statement with: &quot;Nine times outta ten I'd agree with you. And, really, I 
<br>
agree with you now. But there's just one thing...&quot;  My friends and I used 
<br>
it among ourselves, and it worked very well. We'd end up laughing at the 
<br>
preface, and the laughter would forestall any hard feelings about the 
<br>
disagreement.
<br>
<p>There's a lot to be said for humor as a lubricant for human-to-human 
<br>
communication.
<br>
<p>It's just occurred to me that I often unconsciously use a form of the 
<br>
nine-times-outta-ten technique--not from a desire to manipulate but rather 
<br>
to try to find some common ground to start from when I don't agree with 
<br>
something someone has said. In responding to one of Charlie Stross's posts 
<br>
yesterday, I neglected to begin the post by mentioning the part of 
<br>
Charlie's posts that I agreed with, and my post had a far more negative 
<br>
tone than I'd intended. Even though it would have taken more time to list 
<br>
the stuff I agreed with, it would have more accurately reflected my own 
<br>
beliefs, plus it would have provided a common ground--and it would have set 
<br>
a more friendly tone for the whole post.
<br>
