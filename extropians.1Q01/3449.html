</em><br>
<p>The problem, John, is that every one of those warheads was designed with
<br>
the sole purpose of functioning in a 1 bar atmosphere, not a 14 millibar
<br>
atmosphere. Most all of the damage a nuke does is due to atmospheric
<br>
compression effects. If you have little or no atmosphere to compress
<br>
with the blast, damage will be much less, at a much smaller distance, on
<br>
Mars than they would do on Earth. A 10 megaton warhead on Mars would do
<br>
the amount of damage that a 10 kiloton warhead does here on Earth, or
<br>
thereabouts. We've gone over the calculations of using nukes off earth
<br>
before on this list (a few years ago), and as I recall James Rogers did
<br>
some excellent ones. This is why I said what I did. 
<br>
<p>Actually, nuking Mars would likely be the best thing that Earth could do
<br>
for it. The increased heat from the blasts would stimulate a major
<br>
outgassing of CO2, which would help trigger the warming and outgassing
<br>
cycle needed to begin terraforming. Perhaps it should be a standard part
<br>
of a colonization plan to instigate a nuclear war with Earth. ;)
