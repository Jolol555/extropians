</em><br>
<p>This is true. Possibly the outcome of the present disagreements on the 
<br>
ownership of intellectual property will play a large role in determining 
<br>
who owns the assemblers and their output.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;With assemblers wealth in the form of material goods will be effectively

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But people don't seem to change the way they think simply because they're 
<br>
no longer in need of anything. As a tax lawyer I used to meet people who 
<br>
had quite a bit of money. One might think that a person with  $5,000,000 in 
<br>
personally owned assets wouldn't feel the need to accumulate more. But they 
<br>
do, and some of them would still shoot a person they caught trying to steal 
<br>
their car.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   In Chapter 7 of THE SPIKE Damien mentions, in passing, the concept of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guaranteed income as an inheritance. [&quot;...let's not look at a guaranteed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; income as a 'natural right,' like the supposed innate rights to freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speech and liberty. Rather it is an inheritance, something *owed* to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the children of a society whose ancestors for generations have together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; built, and purchased through the work of their minds and hands, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resource base sustaining today's cornucopia.&quot;]  I like this idea a lot, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it ties into the discussion we were recently having about &quot;human nature.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I partially like it and partiall do not as it can be used to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real theivery past and present.  The reason everyone gets the basics in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the NT future is because producing the basics for everyone is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;burden at all on anyone, not because everyone has a claim on everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else simply by virtue of being born.
</em><br>
<p>Even now, though, I don't think it would really be that much of a burden to 
<br>
pay a guaranteed income to everyone in the United States. And yet people 
<br>
get upset at the idea of doing it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But our present system isn't working very well either. Not for the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; majority of people living within it. Most people spend the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their time doing things they don't want to be doing. For most people, life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot be said to be joyful. One reason for this seems to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actually we have far more discretionary time on average than at any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other time and more discretionary income.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't make it clear that I was speaking of the world population, as we 
<br>
now have a global economy. I'm not sure, but I think things have got worse 
<br>
for most people over the past several years. Here's another quote from 
<br>
Theobald (can't say how accurate the figures are, but they're in line with 
<br>
my personal observations):
<br>
<p>&quot;According to Victor Keegan, writing in the British newspaper The Guardian, 
<br>
the richest 20 percent of the world's population increased their share of 
<br>
total global wealth from 70 percent to 85 percent, while the poorest lost 
<br>
ground moving down from 2.3 percent to 1.4 percent. The wealth of Bill 
<br>
Gates, the richest man in the world with $18-billion US, founder of 
<br>
Microsoft the world's premier software company, is greater by itself than 
<br>
that of half a dozen poor countries according to Keegan.
<br>
It is not true that we must continually crank up the economic machine, 
<br>
starve the poor, and work ourselves to death. Believe me about this: I was 
<br>
trained as an economist! The challenge is to set imagination and creativity 
<br>
loose, to think outside the box, to see the opportunities which lie beyond 
<br>
the problems. We can only resolve today's questions by opening up new 
<br>
approaches and seeing new connections.&quot;
<br>
<p>People don't seem to stop accumulating wealth simply because they have 
<br>
everything they need; to the contrary, they seem to accumulate it to the 
<br>
extent that it becomes more of a burden than a benefit.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Here's a quote from one of Theobald's lectures:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;A new image may help us to grasp the ways we shall need to behave in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future. Herman Daly, an economist who challenges the growth ethic, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggested that our present economic system is like a jet plane that must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fly at high speed, because otherwise it will stall and crash. He suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we should start to think about a helicopter which could hover.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, a helicopter is both fuel-inefficient and noisy. I propose that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; start thinking about a glider as our symbol for the future. I recognize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; danger of pushing any analogy too far but there are some fascinating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thoughts which emerge as one considers the operation of a glider.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yukky analogy.
</em><br>
<p>Why?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And who should make these decisions but the local persons/entities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involved?
</em><br>
<p>No one.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Third, the glider is brilliantly designed for its purpose. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; post-industrial world will not have the resources to tolerate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overdesign and waste which is so common today. Overcoming problems by brute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; force, rather than by using imagination and knowledge, will not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acceptable in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the contrary, the amount of resources is drastically increasing.
</em><br>
<p>How do you mean this? I can see how this would be true with NT; but at the 
<br>
moment the amount of water in aquifers is not increasing. The amount of 
<br>
fossil fuel isn't increasing. The amount of topsoil on most agricultural 
<br>
land isn't increasing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Brute force is quite acceptable when it is more efficient than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intellectual and computational resources necessary to calculate a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimal solution.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't the optimal solution always the one that's more efficient? If I can 
<br>
get the most bang for my buck using method A, wouldn't I be foolish to use 
<br>
method B?  Far as I can see brute force is a result of lack of imagination. 
<br>
You throw Mexican peasants off their land so middle class Americans can eat 
<br>
Mexican bananas and flush your shit into the drinking water (brute force) 
<br>
rather than leaving the peasants as they are and growing bananas in 
<br>
microenvironments heated with methane produced from the decomposition of 
<br>
shit; or developing bananas that can grow in cooler climates.
<br>
<p>You spend as many dollars chasing down welfare cheats and imprisoning 
<br>
people who use illegal drugs (brute force) than you would've spent giving 
<br>
everyone in the country a guaranteed income.
