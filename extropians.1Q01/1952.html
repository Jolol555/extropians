Some time back on this list there was a article about the desire of the 
<br>
EcoNazi's to impose a tax on food relative to how &quot;high&quot; it is on the food 
<br>
chain.  I just skimmed it feeling it was..........well....I didn't read it 
<br>
close.
<br>
<p>I did, however, catch the idea of the tax.
<br>
<p>At another time Greg Burch's excellent post in reference to misrepresentation 
<br>
of chinese culture kinda stuck sideways in my head.
<br>
<p>Soooooooooooo....I've got an idear for 'nothere tax.......it oughta go over 
<br>
BIG......for one thing no politician has ever seen a tax he didn't like....so 
<br>
no problem getting it passed.......and for another the revenues should be 
<br>
HUGE.
<br>
<p><p>Tax lying.
<br>
<p>Verifieable lying I mean......misrepresentation.
<br>
<p>Take movies for example......where they show &quot;spaceships&quot; swoooooooping thru 
<br>
this graceful curves like swallows near capastrano.......that's a 
<br>
misrepresentation of the laws of orbital mechanics or something.......a 
<br>
lie.......tax it.
<br>
<p>This tax should be calculated according to how many people are affected and 
<br>
to what degree.  The above mentioned example poisons the minds of countless 
<br>
children for the rest of their lives......so it should be taxed BIG...
<br>
<p>Clinton lying about whatever it was he lied about.......naw.......people 
<br>
EXPECT politicians to lie....they don't beleive em anyway......it affects 
<br>
lots less people.....so tax them at a lower rate.....
