<p>
Today the Van de Graff generator from Edmond Scientific arrived via UPS
<br>
Overnight.
<br>

<br>
<p>I didn't have the resources to purchase a discharge the discharge electrode,
<br>
so I just started playing with moving my hands around the &quot;cloud&quot;
<br>
surrounding the polished aluminum.
<br>
<p>Amazing beyond description!  Kind of a cute little widget.  Looks like a
<br>
little household robot!!
<br>
<p>Anyway, it's a wonderful feeling to play with the electrostatic cloud.  It's
<br>
fun to be not so close as to arc, close enough the keep a good flow between
<br>
the body and the unit.  As the cloud grows, the body move farther and
<br>
farther away from the ball and feel the cloud following and clinging.  Of
<br>
course, moving too quickly breaks the circuit between the body and the
<br>
generator and the cloud &quot;withdraws&quot; and that invisible touchy-feely
<br>
sensation drops dramatically.
<br>
<p>It's bizarre!  I'd swear that there's some kind of intelligence in the
<br>
cloud.
<br>
<p>Even when using my finger as a wand and doing the little lightning bolt
<br>
thing from 13&quot; away, the rythm of the snapping sound is almost musical.
<br>
Like morse code.
<br>
da-dit-dit-dit-zzz-dit-zzz-dit-dit-dit-zzz-dit-zzz-dit-dit-dit-zz-dit-zz-dit
<br>
--.. (hard to express with plain text).  Wierd how that fuzzy &quot;spider web&quot;
<br>
sensation follows me around the house.
<br>
<p>I'd swear I have an electrode in my pleasure center that stimulates the
<br>
nucleus accumbens whenever I'm in the best posture for the maximum
<br>
continuity of the cloud around my body.  Also I've noticed that the cloud
<br>
changes as I change the pressure of my lower teeth against my upper teeth.
<br>
Have you ever tried biting &quot;down&quot; on only one size of your mouth, then
<br>
switching to the other side?  The sensation of the cloud is similar and
<br>
seems related to my eyeball movements as well as posture.
<br>
<p>What the heck is going on?  Is this the &quot;best kept secret&quot; or what!?
<br>
<p>I like licking 9 volt batteries with the tip of my tongue.  Seems perfectly
<br>
safe.  Went ahead and started using my tongue as a discharge electrode from
<br>
about 1 foot from the ball.  Freaky.  Looks cool with the lights out.
<br>
<p>Major question for you scientists: could I use my eyeballs as well?  It's be
<br>
kind of cool to look a lightning bolt in the eye as it travels a foot
<br>
through the air straight into the center of the cornea!  Anyone tried this
<br>
yet?  I'm itching to give it a try but haven't gotten up the nerve; it'd
<br>
bite to have blurry vision.
<br>
<p>Since playing with the thing, I can feel my mother from across the room when
<br>
she walks into the room.  Enchanting and heart warming.  She's got some good
<br>
energy.
<br>
<p>I get absent-minded at times (careless, I suppose).  I went straight from a
<br>
one-hour session with the Van de Graff and sat down at the computer and put
<br>
my hand on the mouse.  Pop-snap!  Suddenly the X-axis on the mouse arrow
<br>
stopped working.  Cleaned the rollers, but didn't fix it.  Y-axis worked
<br>
fine, though.  Replaced it with an optical mouse, but will try to correct
<br>
the root cause of the problem by installing a grounded-discharge pad
<br>
somewhere near the computer.
<br>

<br>
Have a nice day!
