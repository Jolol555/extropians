</em><br>
<p>I have to agree with you on this. Labeling others as crackpots or as
<br>
irrational in order to write them off is a convenient (and lazy) tactic
<br>
that resolves nothing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Again, I know this is a minority view on this list.  However, I have
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; creationists, animal-rights advocates, environmentalists, and various
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is a fairly inarguable position (there will, of course, always be
<br>
one or two exceptions). My own experience is similar to yours, and the
<br>
conclusions I have had to draw are not necessarily what I would want
<br>
them to be. It would be so easy to call Christians (for example) fools
<br>
for believing in what to me is an irrational and delusional belief
<br>
system, but it does no good and changes nothing. It took me many years
<br>
to arrive at this conclusion, and I wasted a lot of energy lashing out
<br>
at people when I could have been trying to work with them. One thing I
<br>
have learned is this: no one changes what they believe because someone
<br>
else tells them they are stupid, idiotic, delusional, irrational, or
<br>
wrong, and the more you do this, the stronger they will hold to their
<br>
beliefs (which are often a source of strength or comfort).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; [snipped a lot here]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll say it again, most people on this list try to project their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs onto opponents.  This leads to poor debating techniques,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misrepresentation of the issues, and total failure to accurately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict opinions and actions of the opponents.  If you think your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents are acting irrationally, it actually is an indication that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't understand their actions.  Even hallucinating or insane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people act in predictable ways deriving out of their own set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; erroneous beliefs.  When someone dismisses an opponent as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational, what they really mean is that they don't understand and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not interested in investigating.
</em><br>
<p>In my brief time on the list I have noticed this tendency, although I
<br>
must say it seems to be endemic to other lists I have been on,
<br>
particularly ones that are an outgrowth of some sort of ideology (and
<br>
extropianism, despite its open-endedness, functions in many ways as an
<br>
ideology). It's a shame, really, because it does lead to inappropriate
<br>
behavior and weak debating, which are a waste of everyone's time and
<br>
energy (I know this, having recently been there). Despite the fact that
<br>
there are many beliefs and practices I consider [insert negative
<br>
adjective here] and useless for my own life, dismissing or ridiculing
<br>
people who embrace them is also [insert negative adjective here], and
<br>
just plain lazy. We humans have evolved in a vast and complex world, and
<br>
our actions and beliefs over millions of years have led to even further
<br>
complexity. There is little chance we will all ever think the same way,
<br>
and life would be boring if we did (and a bit frightening). I say
<br>
embrace our differences and find a way to work together to have a world,
<br>
and a future, we can all find meaning in. There is room enough and,
<br>
given the goals of many of us here, we could have more than enough time.
<br>
<p>As always, Harvey, your analysis was reasonable and thought-provoking.
<br>
<p>just my 2 cents,
<br>
Neal
