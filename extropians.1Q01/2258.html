<em>&gt;  The primary item of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concern is the Greenland ice cap, which may raise sea levels somewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the order of 3-9 feet.
</em><br>
<p>I would think that to people in the vicinity of, say, Houston, where much 
<br>
of the land is only a few feet ASL at the moment, 3-9 feet would seem 
<br>
fairly significant. Changes in temperature and rainfall would probably have 
<br>
more wide-reaching effects than sea level changes, because these would 
<br>
effect food production, peak periods of energy consumption, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This alleged collapse is not imminent, nor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it inevitable.
</em><br>
<p>Very few things are inevitable, but if it appears there's a significant 
<br>
chance of an event that would have major consequences it makes sense to me 
<br>
to be aware of it and perhaps make contingency plans in case the event 
<br>
comes about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What is of concern is not the environmental effects, but the effects on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans.
</em><br>
<p>So you're saying that humans' environment has no effect on them?  (them? 
<br>
maybe I should say us instead of writing as though I'm not a human too)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If Greenland's ice cap collapses, has anyone understood that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this means lots of land available in Greenland for settlement and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultivation, land that is covered by dirt ground up from many thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of years of ice abrasion?
</em><br>
<p>There could be many net positive effects of global warming, just as there 
<br>
could be many net positive effects of nanotechnology. An ultimate net good 
<br>
effect doesn't mean that there won't be a period of adjustment which might 
<br>
not be fun to live through if one allows oneself to be taken by surprise.
