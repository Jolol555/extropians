From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Philosophy:%20It%20doesn't%20suck%20so%20bad%20we%20can't%20ignore%20it%20(and%20Harvey)&In-Reply-To=&lt;086101c07753$e00b4600$39bc473f@jrmolloy&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; For the first time, I realize that this entire thread was meant to be a
</em><br>
joke.
<br>
<em>&gt; This was never a usable definition, it was always a humorous punch-line.
</em><br>
<p>Hear! Hear! Look for the truth in humor, Harvey.
<br>
You don't need a usable definition of snakes to avoid a
<br>
snake-in-the-grass.
<br>
Philosophy acts as a snake-in-the-grass for extropy, it's the humor of
<br>
circular serpents, biting their tails.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I realize that your answers are supposed to be humorous by being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberately circular.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we wouldn't want accidental circularity. The universe (&quot;one turn&quot;)
<br>
is composed of circles within circles, strings within strings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You deliberately kept the conversation by being non-responsive.
</em><br>
<p>Not really, I had some errands to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another joke.  Perhaps you should investigate a concept known as
</em><br>
smiley-faces.
<br>
<p>Since I don't smile while writing these things, it seems disingenuous to
<br>
append a phony emoticon. ô¿ô
<br>
(I wear big spectacles and a big nose.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not an accomplished philosopher.  I seriously was trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out what your content-free postings were trying to say.
</em><br>
<p>So, it's your philosophy that these postings are content-free. Who died
<br>
and made you the Big Kahuna of content evaluation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's OK, you're an accomplished troll.  You are now in my kill-file
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with other trolls.
</em><br>
<p>If I'm a troll, you're a bigger one. Nyah, nyah, nyah (philosophically
<br>
speaking).
<br>
BTW, just what the hell have you contributed that's so content rich?
<br>
Oops... forgot the emoticon: ô¿ô
<br>
<p>Stay hungry, extropians. Luv ya!
