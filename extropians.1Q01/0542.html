<p>Sorry, stuff like <a href="http://neuron.duke.edu/">http://neuron.duke.edu/</a> doesn't scale. The neural 
<br>
hardware does a lot of computations, so you'd be sorely pressed 
<br>
abstracting it all to software. Best way to emulate a given physical 
<br>
system is to tesselate it into voxels, with a set of laws simultaneously 
<br>
applied to them. Mapping a problem to dedicated cellular automata 
<br>
molecular hardware.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we make a real silicon based sim of a brain, it would run much

</em><br>
<p>Indeed, if 1 ms lasts for 20 minutes. Such a critter would not
<br>
be of much use for anything behavioural. It has to be realtime, or
<br>
nearly realtime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But also a solution.  We can run AI in geosynchronous orbit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with restricted downlink.
</em><br>
<p>If it's smart, it can't be contained. If it's useful, it can
<br>
break out.

</em><br>
<p>Sure, it's more fun that way, and since we're not typical,
<br>
nor powerful (as far as I know) as well as few, the decision
<br>
is taken out ouf our hands (with a high probability, though
<br>
I'd welcome to be falsified), anyway.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, this whole thread has been tremendously insightful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the two choices, I personally would choose taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my chances with a possibly hostile AI than simply dying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old fashioned way.  Yet if I had heirs, I see the point
</em><br>
<p>I think the decision space is not boolean. There are a number
<br>
of future directories, some of them more high-risk (and, 
<br>
unfortunately, also high-payoff) and some of them less so.
<br>
<p>For instance, this indicates that making a &quot;natural&quot; AI,
<br>
by figuring out the embryoneuromorphogenesis and the function
<br>
of the early hardware, and raising the resulting &quot;machine child&quot;
<br>
in a human environment should create a more human-like AI,
<br>
which 1) has empathy/can relate to us primates 2) has trouble
<br>
figuring out how it works, since it's only human, and its
<br>
hardware layer is nontrivial. This is different to an ALife
<br>
AI emerged/co-evolved at molecular hardware level. These
<br>
things will be very fast, and probably rather nonhuman. If
<br>
people panick, and try to get them out of the global network,
<br>
this will be interpreted as a hostile act.
<br>
<p>Lack of empathy, access to world information and instrumentation,
<br>
superrealtime speed, stealthy ubiquity, these things all spell 
<br>
out *DANGER* in my book.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of view of the Luddites, who would prefer to relinquish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology and hand a low-tech world to their children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and grandchildren.  I myself see the entire exercise as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless if they too are to grow old and die.  Yet I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see where some may logically disagree.  spike
</em><br>
<p>What is considered &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; is subject to constant
<br>
erosion, even though the age shift in mature industrial societies 
<br>
results in more conservative opinions and policies, stifling 
<br>
progress.
