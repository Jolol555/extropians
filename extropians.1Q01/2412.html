Was Microsoft Works developed in house? I seem to recall that it
<br>
was. Works 1.0 for DOS was a dog, but by version 2.0 (1989!) it had
<br>
matured into a _nice_ lightweight integrated suite, and Works 4 for
<br>
Windows was a classic -- it had the 10% of the features that everybody
<br>
needs, with none of the cruft that has piled up on top of Microsoft
<br>
Office.
<br>
<p>But, IIRC, Microsoft killed Works because it was chewing into sales
<br>
of their (high-end, bloated) flagship product line.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My point is that there's something strange going on inside Microsoft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They have money to hire the best of the best in the industry (their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job interviews is state of the art in Spanish Inquisition), and they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did. But somehow, the company structure is scrambled, and, worse, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scrambled in a way which actively resists fixing.
</em><br>
<p>My personal theory is that Microsoft is the world's greatest marketing
<br>
company. Good software quality is orthogonal to marketing. In fact, once
<br>
you have the market by the throat, _poor_ quality is more desirable,
<br>
because it forces people to keep buying faster computers (more Windows
<br>
licenses! Yippee!) and upgrades (more Office licenses! Yippee!).
<br>
<p>Of course, this is not a long-term survival strategy, as witness
<br>
the identity of the first operating system to ship on the IA-64
<br>
architecture.  Microsoft will get the shit kicked out of them by lean
<br>
and mean competitors, just as IBM did in the 1980's and early 1990's,
<br>
unless they manage to buy the US government lock, stock, and barrel. And
<br>
at least one of the competitors (Linux) is so lean and mean that Microsoft
<br>
will have to fight hard to keep it from chewing their guts out.
<br>
<p>Obligatory dystopia: &quot;Outlaw School&quot;, by Rebecca Ore. A novel I heartily
<br>
commend to all Extropians, with the caveat that you should *not* read it
<br>
when you're feeling depressed.
