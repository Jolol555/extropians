</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And while we're on the subject of the little list (of people who won't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;missed),
</em><br>
<p>I worked a couple of contracts at Apple.  One was in 1993, and the 
<br>
other was last year, so I got a taste of Apple without and then with 
<br>
Jobs.  It's really amazing how one man can drive a company if he has 
<br>
a few ideas, passion for those ideas, and will yell and scream at his 
<br>
employees - or if that fails, fire them - in order to see those ideas 
<br>
implemented to his satisfaction.
<br>
<p>The change in the atmosphere at Apple between the two contracts was 
<br>
positively palpable.  My first term there, I just knew that disaster 
<br>
was looming.  Apple was doing well financially, but they didn't 
<br>
really have strong leadership.  The lack of enthusiasm or even basic 
<br>
motivation in the rank and file was obvious.
<br>
<p>That all changed by the time that I returned.  By then, Jobs had 
<br>
remolded the whole attitude of the company.  The groups that I worked 
<br>
with knew a hell of a lot more about what they were trying to 
<br>
accomplish, and received some measure of feedback from Jobs 
<br>
personally if they were off track.
<br>
<p>I never really met the guy, although I did follow him one time at the 
<br>
salad bar - he likes a big pile of shredded carrots for lunch.  I 
<br>
seriously contemplated giving him an enormous wedgie... sure, I would 
<br>
have been fired, but I would have been &quot;that guy who gave Steve Jobs 
<br>
a wedgie&quot;.  Ah well, spilt milk.
<br>
<p>To say that Steve Jobs wouldn't be missed is ridiculous.  You'd be 
<br>
missing him alright, if he and Wozniak had never made personal 
<br>
computers viable back in the late 70's.  How many years would it have 
<br>
taken IBM or someone else to put it all together and market it 
<br>
successfully?  Two? Five?  Ten?
<br>
<p>Think of all of the ideas that Jobs helped to drive forward, like 
<br>
desktop publishing, affordable laser printing, and GUIs.  USB was a 
<br>
technology that Intel had been pitching for *years* to PC 
<br>
manufacturers, but that had never caught on.  In one sweep, Jobs put 
<br>
USB as the main interface on all new Macs, and the entire computer 
<br>
industry quickly followed.  USB is a good thing.
<br>
<p>An alternative world that had never had Steve Jobs would have 
<br>
contained a PC industry 10 or 20 years behind the one that we live in 
<br>
now.  No thanks.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
