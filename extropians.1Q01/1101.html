An excerpt with comments:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Why has Poland prospered and Russia struggled since the end of the cold war?
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
[Because Poland outcompeted Russia for  investment dollars, among other 
<br>
things?]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Why is the economy of South Korea 15 times as large as that of Ghana when 
<br>
they were comparable less than 40 years ago?
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>[Because S Korea outcompeted Ghana for investment dollars? (American aid 
<br>
didn't hurt, either)]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Why have the Chinese minorities thrived economically in such different 
<br>
places as Malaysia, the Philippines and San Francisco?
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>[Because out of all the people in China, the emigrants were among the most 
<br>
motivated and...competitive? And when they got to their new homelands, they 
<br>
outcompeted many others there, too? (not surprsingly since they were among 
<br>
the most competitive of ~1 billion and they moved to countries where the 
<br>
populationis much less)]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
The answer, in all cases, is culture, according to a growing number of 
<br>
scholars who have come to believe that social attitudes are more important 
<br>
than politics and economics in determining why some societies are richer 
<br>
than others.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>[The culture of competition?
<br>
<p>So, maybe we should all compete harder for investment dollars?
<br>
Ghana can start competing harder, and some of that investment capital will 
<br>
flow to Ghana instead of S Korea. And then S Korea can compete harder to win 
<br>
back those investment dollars from Ghana, and so on and so forth, squared, 
<br>
and applied to every country on Earth.
<br>
<p>We can all work harder for...what? Making and buying consumer geegaws? 
<br>
Raising kids? Building property values?
<br>
<p>These articles are talking about something that should have been obvious to 
<br>
any well-read person 10 years ago. But they have just peeled one layer from 
<br>
the onion, and act like it is a grand revelation....]
<br>
<p>Me, I just wanna live forever, and I am not sure if all this energy being 
<br>
devoted to corporate free marketeering is gonna get me there.
