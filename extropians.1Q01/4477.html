i'm going to have to disagree. he wasn't stifling Ice-T's freedom of speech, 
<br>
he was pointing out pointless, inflammatory, and violent lyrics to the 
<br>
shareholders of the company that was paying to produce them.
<br>
<p>Ice-T is free to, (and does) say whatever he wants on his own time. he 
<br>
doesn't have a right to be reproduced by someone at cost.
<br>
<p>I think Heston's point was that people were tiptoing around IceT because he 
<br>
was black. and stopping it, would seem racist. which is, pretty dumb. it's 
<br>
not racist, it's just anti-violence, anti-rape, anti-misogny, whatever. i've 
<br>
heard the song, it's not really worth much.

<p><em>&gt;From: Loree Thomas Maybe it's just me, but maybe not. Didn't Mr. Heston on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the one hand condemn the stifling of freedom of speech on campus and on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other BRAG about his role in stifling Ice-T's freedom of speech?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think it was damned fine at all... It struck me as right wing, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reactionary, illogical, muddled and emotionally loaded. Not exptropic, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarian, not rational.  Loree
