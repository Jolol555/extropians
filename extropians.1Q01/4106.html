<p>This was a shockingly erroneous analysis, even for someone writing so long
<br>
ago. I suppose it might seem plausible if you assume that people arrived at
<br>
the same time as the rest of nature and not at the end of a very long
<br>
adaptive process that generated ab initio novelties such as planning and
<br>
intention. But even then, it's dopy in the extreme. A human opens her mouth
<br>
and sends gases moving across the vibrating folds inside her throat; we
<br>
call this speech, and know that it was indeed intended for communication. A
<br>
burst of air movement across a stand of trees causes the leaves to shake
<br>
audibly; we know that this is a complete happenstance, unintended; any
<br>
analogy with speech is a foolish superstitious error. A star reaches a
<br>
certain age and collapses into a supernova that scatters elements necessary
<br>
to the emergence of life in some distant as-yet-unborn solar system; we
<br>
know that this is a complete happenstance, unintended, however necessary in
<br>
hindsight for the development of minds able to see the difference between
<br>
intentionless physical sequences and the telic actions of complex beings.
<br>
<p>Aristotle had his analogical arrow of explanation pointed in the wrong
<br>
direction. How can you find his mistake `very interesting'?
