<em>&gt;&gt;  Neal, from your comments so far on this lists, it seems that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  consistently ally yourself not only with liberal ideas, but with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  liberal partisanship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And what exactly would be the problem with this?
</em><br>
<p>Nothing, by itself - I agree with lots of ideas embraced by the left. 
<br>
I'm just pointing out that you criticized someone for supposedly 
<br>
identifying with a certain &quot;side&quot;, but your stances indicate that you 
<br>
have your own side.  Pot, kettle?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;No, give me a break. I've already explained my position as to this whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;side-taking nonsense. If you refuse to get it, I can't help you.
</em><br>
<p>Just because you give lip service to the idea of partisan 
<br>
independence doesn't mean that you live by it.  You might try not 
<br>
being so offended when someone makes a jab at the left.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; Ironically, I think that your criticism mostly stems from the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that Brian is poking a jab at &quot;your side&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not true. If you've carefully read my other posts here you'd see that I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reacting against knee-jerk side-taking.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, if you had read Brian's post carefully, you would have 
<br>
noticed that he didn't claim to be on one side or the other.  He 
<br>
simply said that &quot;the other side&quot; was getting a taste of their own 
<br>
medicine.  He could easily have been referring to the other side of 
<br>
Heston's affiliation, but your own simplistic thinking didn't give 
<br>
Brian the benefit of the doubt, you just pounced.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Just because I don't side with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't mean I am on the other side. This is the type of tired old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;oppositional thinking I reject. It's just not very forward thinking.
</em><br>
<p>If you reject tired old thinking, then how can you see what happened 
<br>
in Florida as anything but a power struggle between two political 
<br>
parties using every legal means they each had at their disposal.  The 
<br>
struggle was initiated by the Democrats because they were behind in 
<br>
the count, then it was finished by the Republicans, because they had 
<br>
the highest trump card to play.
<br>
<p>To say that &quot;we have no president&quot; is an indicator that you bought 
<br>
into every single scrap of Democratic thought that came out of the 
<br>
whole affair.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
