Just one of many obsolete questions listed at The Edge.
<br>
This is one very fine project!

<br>
<p>&quot;The definition of life and consciousness?&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/questions/q2001.2.html">http://www.edge.org/documents/questions/q2001.2.html</a>
<br>
Some scientific questions cannot be resolved, but rather are dissolved,
<br>
and vanish once we begin to better understand their terms.
<br>
<p>This is often the case for &quot;definitional questions&quot;. For instance, what is
<br>
the definition of life? Can we trace a sharp boundary between what is
<br>
living and what is not living? Is a virus living? Is the entire earth a
<br>
living organism? It seems that our brain predisposes us to ask questions
<br>
that require a yes or no answer. Moreover, as scientists, we'd like to
<br>
keep our mental categories straight and, therefore, we would like to have
<br>
neat and tidy definitions of the terms we use. However, especially in the
<br>
biological sciences, the objects of reality do not conform nicely to our
<br>
categorical expectations. As we delve into research, we begin to realize
<br>
that what we naively conceived of as a essential category is, in fact, a
<br>
cluster of loosely bound properties that each need to be considered in
<br>
turn (in the case of life: metabolism, reproduction, autonomy, homeostasy,
<br>
etc..). Thus, what was initially considered as a simple question,
<br>
requiring a straightforward answer, becomes a complex issue or even a
<br>
whole domain of research. We begin to realize that there is no single
<br>
answer, but many different answers depending on how one frames the terms
<br>
of the question. And eventually, the question is simply dropped. It is not
<br>
longer relevant.
<br>
<p>I strongly suspect that one of today's hottest scientific question,s the
<br>
definition of consciousness, is of this kind. Some scientists seem to
<br>
believe that what we call consciousness is an essence of reality, a single
<br>
coherent phenomenon that can be reduced to a single level such as a
<br>
quantum property of microtubules. Another possibility, however, that
<br>
consciousness is a cluster of properties that, most of the time, cohere
<br>
together in awake adult humans. A minimal list probably includes the
<br>
ability to attend to sensory inputs or internal thoughts, to make them
<br>
available broadly to multiple cerebral systems, to store them in working
<br>
memory and in episodic memory, to manipulate them mentally, to act
<br>
intentionally based on them, and in particular to report them verbally. As
<br>
we explore the issue empirically, we begin to find many situations (such
<br>
as visual masking or specific brain lesions) in which those properties
<br>
break down. The neat question &quot;what is consciousness&quot; dissolves into a
<br>
myriad of more precise and more fruitful research avenues.
<br>
<p>Any biological theory of consciousness, which assumes that consciousness
<br>
has evolved, implies that &quot;having consciousness&quot; is not an all-or-none
<br>
property. The biological substrates of consciousness in human adults are
<br>
probably also present, but only in partial form, in other species, in
<br>
young children or brain-lesioned patients. It is therefore a partially
<br>
arbitrary question whether we want to extend the use of the term
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; to them. For instance, several mammals, and even very
<br>
young human children, show intentional behavior, partially reportable
<br>
mental states, some working memory ability - but perhaps no theory of
<br>
mind, and more &quot;encapsulated&quot; mental processes that cannot be reported
<br>
verbally or even non-verbally. Do they have consciousness, then? My bet is
<br>
that once a detailed cognitive and neural theory of the various aspects of
<br>
consciousness is available, the vacuity of this question will become
<br>
obvious.
