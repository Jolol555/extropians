War On Drugs Targets Tech
<br>
<p>By Lewis Z. Koch Special To Interactive Week,
<br>
<p>The new scapegoat for the failed War on Drugs is, of all things, technology.
<br>
<p>The 120-page December 2000 International Crime Threat Assessment report -
<br>
created by basically every federal law enforcement agency in the U.S. - is
<br>
riddled with examples of how computer technology has advanced the cause of
<br>
national and international crime. Modern telecommunications and information
<br>
systems, state-of-the-art communications equipment, computers - they're all
<br>
to blame.
<br>
<p>What the report fails to squarely acknowledge is that the oil that fuels
<br>
organized crime in the U.S. and abroad, including terrorist organizations,
<br>
is profit from the trade in illegal drugs bound for the U.S. - billions of
<br>
dollars in profit from drug sales that enhance the power of international
<br>
crime cartels and their ability to corrupt police, judges and governmental
<br>
officials from Tijuana to Tanzania.
<br>
<p>&quot;Through the use of computers, international criminals have an
<br>
unprecedented capability to obtain, process and protect information and
<br>
sidestep law enforcement investigations,&quot; the report stated. &quot;They can use
<br>
the interactive capabilities of advanced computers and telecommunications
<br>
systems to plot marketing strategies for drugs and other illicit
<br>
commodities, to find the most efficient routes and methods for smuggling
<br>
and moving money in the financial system and to create false trails for law
<br>
enforcement or banking security.&quot;
<br>
<p>It goes on to assert: &quot;More threateningly, some criminal organizations
<br>
appear to be adept at using technology for counterintelligence purposes and
<br>
for tracking law enforcement activities.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, it's not our flawed drug policy that's to blame - it's new
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>Where All This Began
<br>
<p>In 1937, Harry J. Anslinger, six years into his 30-year-reign as director
<br>
at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, testified before the U.S. Senate on
<br>
behalf of the &quot;Marihuana Tax Act.&quot; This delighted the Hearst newspapers,
<br>
which, lacking a real war to increase newspaper sales, launched an all-out
<br>
battle against demon marijuana. Here are a few excerpts from Anslinger's
<br>
sworn testimony. Clearly, our drug policy traces its roots to reasoning
<br>
that was as racist and alarmist as it was wildly inaccurate:
<br>
<p>* &quot;There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are
<br>
Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz
<br>
and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana can cause white women
<br>
to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate
<br>
races.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity,
<br>
criminality and death.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.&quot;
<br>
<p>With Hearst's backing, Anslinger's war on marijuana escalated to an all-out
<br>
war on narcotics.
<br>
<p>Now, after six and a half decades of speeches and hundreds of thousands,
<br>
perhaps millions, of arrests, convictions and sentences, what signs point
<br>
to even modest success in this multitrillion-dollar war against drugs? Drug
<br>
trafficking is the most profitable of all illegal activities, according to
<br>
the International Crime Threat Assessment.
<br>
<p>Where Do We Go from Here?
<br>
<p>Instead of rethinking the sanity of our basic policy on drugs, federal
<br>
police agencies appear bent on blaming technology - unbreakable encryption
<br>
via e-mail, encrypted cellular phones and faster, cheaper networked
<br>
computers - for the losses sustained in the drug war. This is clearly
<br>
nonsense.
<br>
<p>In 1999 alone, Americans spent an estimated $63 billion on illegal drugs,
<br>
according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. And the National
<br>
Institute on Drug Abuse stated: &quot;The estimated total cost of drug abuse in
<br>
the United States - including health care and lost productivity - was $110
<br>
billion in 1995, the latest year for which data is available.&quot;
<br>
<p>In addition, a U.S. Customs Service report said the department will soon be
<br>
able to inspect only 1 percent of all goods entering the U.S.
<br>
<p>This is the score after six and a half decades of our drug policy. Do we
<br>
have to wait until 2037 to recognize that we lost the Hundred Years' Drug
<br>
War? And,! in the meantime, will we see more and more attacks on technology
<br>
as the evil ally of narcotics?
<br>
<p>The obvious yet politically difficult solution here is to remove the
<br>
profitability factor from drugs. Will there be more casualties? Will more
<br>
people succumb to addiction? Maybe. But don't we already have casualties?
<br>
You have to employ some tortured logic to rationalize how removing the
<br>
profit incentive from drug use could make things any worse than they are.
<br>
<p>Now the Feds want to escalate the war as an excuse for having their way
<br>
with encryption. But encryption is an essential business tool and a means
<br>
of protecting our privacy. Outlawing it as a scapegoat of our drug policy
<br>
is like trembling in fear before the great Wizard of Oz and paying no
<br>
attention to the discredited man and his policies behind the curtain.
<br>
<p>Introducing Lewis Koch's &quot;First Annual George Orwell 1984 Award&quot;
<br>
<p>The prize, a 1949 first-edition copy of Orwell's 1984, worth about $100,
<br>
will be awarded to the reader who supplies the best tip about an
<br>
egregious assault on personal privacy. The judges will be yours truly, plus
<br>
Richard M. Smith and other officers of the Privacy Foundation.
<br>
<p>E-mail all suggestions to lzkoch@&lt;<a href="http://mediaone.netmediaone.net">http://mediaone.netmediaone.net</a>. All tips
<br>
will be held in strictest confidence, so the award might well go to
<br>
&quot;anonymous.&quot; All suggestions will be fully investigated and thoroughly
<br>
checked.
