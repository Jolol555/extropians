<p>SafetyOn : The Comprehensive Guide to Firearm Safety
<br>
and Responsible Gun Ownership
<br>
<p>It's a bit pricy for a college student ($40), but you might be able to
<br>
get some other people to chip in. It is also possible your college has a
<br>
rifle program. They, or the school library, might be able to justify
<br>
buying and lending it. Or getting a copy on approval and letting you be
<br>
part of the review group :).

</em><br>
<p>The Model 23 is the smaller conventional frame .40 Lib. There is a more
<br>
compact Glock .40, but some people think it's harder to control. Go to a
<br>
range that rents and try 'em all. Don't be in a hurry to plunk down $500
<br>
or more on a purchase you'll come to regret.
<br>
<p>Gunnies call 'em &quot;autoloaders&quot; too. &quot;Kill me&quot;? No, thanks. I don't much
<br>
hold with it. :) Since owning firearms, I have found in myself a marked
<br>
tendency to not say stuff like that. FWIW.
