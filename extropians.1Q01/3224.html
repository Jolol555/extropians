</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think it is perhaps not that bad.
<br>
<p>The police have not that many rights beyond what any other citizien has.
<br>
<p>There is the Diallo case, I think those guilty police officers should have been judged
<br>
guilty instead of acquitted, if they are guilty, like the Central Park PD.
<br>
<p>So, the police can't do anything except ask you questions, and use their actual senses
<br>
and judgment.
<br>
<p>One time a bouncer at a bar started hassling me and this other guy as we walked by, he
<br>
assaulted him and then me as I was there.  We were about to defend ourselves when he
<br>
declared himself an off-duty police officer, armed with a flashlight.  Then he asked us
<br>
politely to move along.  So, we did not assault him in self-defense and have him sent to
<br>
jail.

<p>I see more problems not with physical search abuses, because I do not encounter them,
<br>
but rather with information search abuses.  I make reasonable attempts to disallow
<br>
intruders over the network into my personal computers, for example.  It is reasonable to
<br>
the point that if anyone is on there otherwise, that then they are intruding in a
<br>
probably non-legal way.  The only physical search or stop that I have seen, besides
<br>
traffic violation stops, was on the highway outside of El Paso, Texas.  About 17 miles
<br>
past the border is the end of the international visitation zone.  So, on the Interstate,
<br>
which is one of the roads through there, there is a old weigh station made a turnoff
<br>
where each car must stop and the driver is asked if he is a U.S. citizen.  The station
<br>
was manned by U.S. Border Patrol (Marshals).  I said yes and asked if that was all.  He
<br>
said yes.  I then drove away.
<br>
<p><p>So basically, the cops are searchable.
