I like George Will.  I usually like what he has to say, and I take 
<br>
the time to read his writings carefully.  This piece, however, is one 
<br>
of those things that makes me just hang my head for a second and sigh 
<br>
in disappointment.
<br>
<p><p>George Will wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;Enhancement is not therapy, it is eugenics. Genetic selection--the negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eugenics of preventing certain traits in children--is already common,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through genetic screening and amniocentesis. However, at least negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eugenics is supposed to serve an existing norm of health. But positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eugenics, any tailoring of an individual's genetic endowment, even when less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ambitious than cloning, will put us on a slippery slope to the abolition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;man.
</em><br>
<p>What an artificial distinction that is, &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; 
<br>
eugenics.  If a doctor fixes my child's DNA so that he doesn't die of 
<br>
a heart attack when he's 2, that would be &quot;positive&quot; eugenics, I'd 
<br>
imagine.  What if the doctor fixes it so that my son doesn't die of a 
<br>
heart defect at 15... 30... 65... 100?  Where is that 
<br>
negative/positive line?
<br>
<p>If a doctor fixes a genetic problem that keeps my child from having 
<br>
an IQ below 70, is that negative?  What about 100 or 140 or 180?  Who 
<br>
draws the line?
<br>
<p>I'm sure that Mr. Will would draw the line at wherever the 
<br>
statistical average lies, but why?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Genetic manipulation extends the belief that all children should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wanted--a principle justifying abortion--to embrace the belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children, to be acceptable, should, in their genetic traits, satisfy our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants for their identities.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, so when my wife and I spend our time teaching our daughter her 
<br>
alphabet, we're not just trying to give her an advantage in this 
<br>
world, to make her life easier - we're trying to satisfy our wants 
<br>
for her identity.  Our reasons are purely selfish.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When parents can preselect their child's genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constitution, procreation will become manufacture, children will become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artifacts, identity and individuality will become confused, and parents will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become despots.
</em><br>
<p>How in the hell does this follow?  How does making choices to benefit 
<br>
your child make you a despot?  My wife chose to not drink during her 
<br>
pregnancy, is she now a despot?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But it is not good, Kass insists, if human nature becomes just the last part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of nature turned into raw material for human willfulness. ANDi is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intimation that nuclear explosions are not the only way science can end the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human story. Biology might do that more gradually than physics can, but no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less decisively, and even more repugnantly.
</em><br>
<p>By making life a little easier for ourselves and our offspring, we're 
<br>
going to destroy mankind.  By helping our children to be able to run 
<br>
a little faster, to live a little longer, and to be a little smarter; 
<br>
we're going to destroy mankind.
<br>
<p>Disappointing... so disappointing.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
