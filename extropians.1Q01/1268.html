<p>I'll assume you've heard all you want to about Mr. Warwick and his
<br>
implant experiments (past and planned).  If not, he should be tres easy
<br>
to look up; some critics go so far as to call him a media hound.

<p>That's only nine plus a note, but I can flood the list with more if you
<br>
really want.  Oh, and did I mention my college thesis on connecting
<br>
neurons to electromechanical devices back in '96?  It's more of a
<br>
thought piece than a scientific breakthrough, I'll admit, but I can send
<br>
you an HTML copy of it if you want.  (I don't have a personal site to
<br>
put it on at this time, mainly because I have little need for one just
<br>
now.)  As far as I can tell, most of what it argues for became
<br>
commercial reality by early '99.
<br>
<p>The point is: these can start by mimicing not-so-complex functions
<br>
outside of the brain, then slowly creep in as the functions are reverse
<br>
engineered.  AI, if it is to preclude the possibility of uploading (and
<br>
thus, have no mapping from organic brain to silicon), must start
<br>
essentially from scratch - and that effort's behind.
