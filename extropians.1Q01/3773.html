</em><br>
<p>I tossed off Robert's point with a distracting riff about singalongs,
<br>
but he makes a good argument, to which I do not know the answer.
<br>
We have a curious uxtaposition of free market, state and local
<br>
government.  For instance, we do welfare on a state level,
<br>
vote on power plants on a county level and kinda sorta let
<br>
free markets determine the price of gas but not electricity.
<br>
<p>The upshot is, the economically overcooked SF Bay area
<br>
is clearly exporting its problems.  San Jose is home to large
<br>
numbers of power hungry server farms.  Logical place for
<br>
them because they dont really take up much expensive room,
<br>
but use a lot of power, which is subsidized!  The Taxifornia
<br>
state government wont pull the plug, since they continue
<br>
to calmly collect 1.28% annual tax on all the ridiculously
<br>
overpriced Silicon Valley real estate, as well as a cool
<br>
11% income tax on all these juicy 6 digit incomes, in addition
<br>
to the 7.8% sales tax.
<br>
<p>Santa Clara county is laughably overheated economically.
<br>
The result is there is no low-cost housing, so there are few
<br>
if any poor people.  When one pays thousands per month
<br>
in taxes, one does not *care* if the power bill is 50 or 100
<br>
or 300 a month, its all down in the noise.
<br>
<p>Consequently, Santa Clara county consistently votes to
<br>
export power plants, and the long term result is that the
<br>
cost of power goes up for everyone.  Even if free markets
<br>
prevail and voters were not consulted, Santa Clara county
<br>
*still* wouldnt have power plants built on it, for the ground
<br>
is far too expensive for utilities.
<br>
<p>Whats the fair way to determine where power plants go? spike
