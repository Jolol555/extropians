<em>&gt;Events On This Day In History...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wednesday - January 24th...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Day 24 of the year 2001,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1986,  Voyager II flies past Uranus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(memories!! I was at JPL watching, gathering our Voyager data)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In a day or two from this date, the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And I saw it happen, Amara, from the air over central Florida
<br>
in a training flight 28 January 1986 with Capt. Tom E. Davis
<br>
(USN, ret.) as my instructor, flying right seat.  I have
<br>
the log entry here:
<br>
<p>Date: 28 Jan 1986
<br>
Aircraft Make &amp; Model: C-150
<br>
Ident: N5396Q
<br>
From: X-31 (Crystal River Florida)
<br>
To: LCL (local)
<br>
Remarks, Procedures, Maneuvers: AF5 (the syllabus designation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the flight, followed by Capt. Davis' CFII number)
<br>
Number of Landings: 1
<br>
...etc.
<br>
<p>The number of landings was unusual: 1.  All the surrounding entries,
<br>
including an earlier flight the _same day_ had me pegged at an
<br>
average of 8 landings/flight; I was halfway through my first
<br>
certification at the time, not too far from its flight test.
<br>
<p>You see, we'd gotten up to about 4300' MSL, which was plenty
<br>
of altitude on a clear day inland of Florida's Gulf coast to
<br>
give us visibility on the high altitudes over the Atlantic
<br>
coast.  We saw the single rising plume, the chaotic mess
<br>
at (what I later heard) was the 85 second mark (throttleup)
<br>
and the fingers of smoke arcing in contradictory directions.
<br>
<p>Capt. Davis understood the smoke signs sooner than I, and
<br>
without any talk at all took the yoke and throttle and
<br>
got us back down on the ground very quickly...
<br>
that one-and-only-one landing of that flight.
<br>
<p>We didn't talk as we taxied, nor as we shut down the engine,
<br>
climbed out, tied down, chocked, and wandered back to the
<br>
FBO (which he owned at the time).
<br>
<p>It was then that I understood fully, when we walked in to
<br>
the pilot's lounge.  All the pilots were sitting around the
<br>
television.  Crying.
<br>
<p>This day in history, indeed.  We'll get to the stars
<br>
eventually, _despite_ NASA.
<br>
<p>Russell
