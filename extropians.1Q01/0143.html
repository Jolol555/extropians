<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've been trying to think of an Extropian angle on this film, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;haven't had much luck.
</em><br>
<p>Nor have I.  I enjoyed some aspects of the film, but
<br>
there was no take-home Extropian value to it for me.
<br>
I agree with Phil Osborn's general assessment of the
<br>
odious Chinese cultural values celebrated in the movie,
<br>
particularly the emphasis on duty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This movie takes martial arts action to the next level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Substitute &quot;martial dance&quot; for &quot;martial arts&quot; and I'll
<br>
agree with you.  The title &quot;Fight Choreographer&quot; is the
<br>
well-chosen role for the person in charge of the &quot;fight&quot;
<br>
scenes in this movie and The Matrix.  Remember, most of
<br>
these actors come from a background in Peking or Cantonese
<br>
Opera, both of which train young children in a panoply
<br>
of show skills, of which stage fighting is but one.
<br>
Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and a number of other notables
<br>
in HK cinema (and recently, Taiwanese) come from this
<br>
culture of very well trained entertainers.  Michelle Yeoh
<br>
is primarily a dancer with some southern Hung Gar, some northern
<br>
temple style, and lots of recent grounding in stage fighting.
<br>
Not bad for a former Miss Malaysia, but not a fighter.
<br>
<p>Folks, fight scenes on screen are _choreographed_ to show as
<br>
much flash as possible.  I saw _so_ many particular instances
<br>
in the &quot;fight&quot; scenes in this movie (and the Matrix, another
<br>
strange favorite of some of you here) where, at any particular
<br>
point, a _real_ version of the blow received by the opponent
<br>
would have ended the fight, right then and there.  Makes for
<br>
a dull movie, though, to end the fight so quickly.
<br>
<p>I do recommend the movie, though, if you bear in mind that
<br>
attempting most of the non-wirework fighting techniques
<br>
showcased in the film will get you killed, with a quickness.
<br>
Incredibly entertaining.
<br>
<p>Now, if you're still trying to get something Extropian
<br>
out of the film, though, here's this: take what Dean Tribble
<br>
calls &quot;grace training&quot;.  I'd recommend ballroom dancing and
<br>
Tai Chi Chuan, together.  Don't take the emasculated Mainland
<br>
style of Tai Chi; find yourself an old Taiwanese person to
<br>
teach you.  If you're in the Bay area, I recommend Adam Hsu
<br>
(my old Shaolin teacher), who teaches Tai Chi as well as
<br>
northern style Long Fist.  Not sure if he's spending more
<br>
time in Taipei nowadays, though.  Decades ago, the really
<br>
good Chinese martial artists fled the Communists for homes
<br>
in Taipei and San Francisco.
<br>
<p>If you're wanting to learn how to fight, I recommend
<br>
Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu, what I practice now.  Email me.
<br>
