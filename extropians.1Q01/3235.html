Experimental Drug May Undo Damage Found in Aging Blood Vessels
<br>
<p>By REUTERS
<br>
<p>An experimental drug has been found to undo age-associated blood 
<br>
vessel damage in monkeys, according to results of a new study.  
<br>
<p>With age, and especially in diabetics, blood vessels tend to stiffen 
<br>
due to an increase in collagen crosslinks, attachments between 
<br>
collagen and glucose (sugar) that may impair collagen flexibility. 
<br>
Collagen is a protein normally present in connective tissue, bone, 
<br>
cartilage and skin.  
<br>
<p>``Stiffer blood vessels relate to a greater likelihood for an 
<br>
increase in arterial pressure to occur, and increase the workload on 
<br>
the heart as it pumps blood into the arteries,'' said Dr. Edward G. 
<br>
Lakatta, of the National Institutes of Health, in an interview with 
<br>
Reuters Health.  
<br>
<p>In the study, the research team injected six rhesus monkeys with ALT-
<br>
711 every other day over a 3-week period. ALT-711 is an experimental 
<br>
drug that breaks existing collagen crosslinks.  
<br>
<p>Tests showed that the monkeys' vessels were significantly less stiff 
<br>
6 weeks after drug treatment was completed and for nearly 6 months 
<br>
thereafter. In addition, measures of heart function improved, 
<br>
according to the report in the January 30th issue of the Proceedings 
<br>
of the National Academy of Sciences.  
<br>
<p>``The finding suggests (ALT-711) could be a new treatment for high 
<br>
blood pressure, heart failure and certain vascular complications of 
<br>
diabetes'' in humans, according to a statement from the National 
<br>
Institutes of Health.  
<br>
<p>``(ALT-711) has passed safety tests in humans and studies are under 
<br>
way to determine its effects on vascular stiffness and arterial 
<br>
pressure in humans,'' Lakatta told Reuters Health.  
<br>
<p>``Prospects in treating humans with ALT-711 are being determined in 
<br>
both ongoing and planned clinical trials in humans. People could get 
<br>
the drug following completion of clinical trial studies,'' he added.
