<em>&gt; This guy was the subject of an article in WIRED months ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposedly he was working on perfecting the Stirling (sp) engine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for use as a portable power source.
</em><br>
<p>BTW I found the original article forwarded here at
<br>
<a href="http://www.inside.com/it.html">http://www.inside.com/it.html</a>.  They also have a message board where
<br>
people can put up their guesses, which is where I think the human
<br>
air-hockey puck idea came from.
<br>
<p>The Wired article Brian mentions was
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/kamen.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/kamen.html</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, Kamen has broadened his work beyond health care. He believes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology and ingenuity can solve all kinds of social ills - like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pollution, limited access to electricity, and contaminated water
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in many third-world countries, where bacteria from human feces in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drinking water is a leading cause of cholera. To help ameliorate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the water problem, Deka's team of 170 engineers is working on a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nonpolluting engine - funded by several million dollars of Kamen's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own money - based on a concept first floated in the early 1800s but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never realized.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The device is called the Stirling engine; Kamen hopes it can be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developed into an affordable, portable machine that will run a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water purifier/power generator that could zap contaminated H20 with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a UV laser to make it safe for drinking. &quot;It can burn any fuel, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can do all kinds of things with it,&quot; he says. &quot;It might be very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valuable in emerging economies, giving them access to electricity,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the Net.&quot;
<br>
<p>This sounds like a likely guess given the size of the device described
<br>
in the article (fits in a duffle bag, roughly).  However the Wired
<br>
article goes on to say,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project, to be unveiled in the next year, will necessitate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;building &quot;the largest company in New Hampshire,&quot; Kamen says with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;characteristic bravura. He's shy about details, except to say it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involves a consumer device unrelated to health care and will require
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100 million in financing. Among the investors: Kleiner Perkins.
<br>
<p>The secrecy might point to this as IT rather than the Stirling engine,
<br>
although it could be misdirection, the factory actually being for
<br>
producing the engine.
