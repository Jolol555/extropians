<em>&gt; I have a love hate relationship with Frontpage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I learned to write html by looking at source for web pages I liked and
</em><br>
seeing how they worked, which is the same way I learned how to write
<br>
JavaScript.  I feel very comfortable coding by hand with full knowledge that
<br>
when I do so I can create a wide variety of pages that work in the majority
<br>
of browsers out there today.  I also know that the pages I create can be
<br>
moved from one server platform to another with ease.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FrontPage uses proprietary extensions to accomplish a great many tasks
</em><br>
which can make its code very hard to read/alter/migrate. On the IIS server
<br>
that we use at work,(I would prefer Apache on a Linux box)we had a problem
<br>
with several of the features from FrontPage breaking on a regular basis for
<br>
reasons that took us weeks to figure out and fix.  Using FrontPage can add
<br>
huge levels of complexity to the Administration of a web server and having
<br>
had to deal with this I have learned to despise FrontPage.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, many of my cutomers/co-workers/students are not at all familiar
</em><br>
with the hand creation of web pages and wouldn't know html if it bit them.
<br>
With FrontPage these same individuals can create amazing web sites, complete
<br>
with chat rooms, message boards, guestbooks, and forms along with a great
<br>
many other features.  This simple fact has allowed our intranet to grow at a
<br>
much faster rate since more people are able to place the information they
<br>
are responsible for up on the Intranet server into professional web pages.
<br>
Now, most of the Government specific information that I need for my job I am
<br>
able to get right at my desk with little to no hassle.  It is the very fact
<br>
that FrontPage empowers even the HTML ignorant to create fantastic and
<br>
useful web pages that I love.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I would probably never use FrontPage for my own web work, I would
</em><br>
definately recommend it for people in a Microsoft environment who have
<br>
neither the time nor the inclination to learn HTML but do have a need to
<br>
publish.
<br>

<p>Good call.
<br>
<p>I hand code, I admit it. I have to, of course.
<br>
<p>However, I did just discover Frontpage, and it saves me heaps of time. Of
<br>
course, I have to inspect everything it does, and redo tons of it, but for
<br>
knocking up front end html, it's very good. So if I need to make a page
<br>
which needs to be very functional (using asp), and pretty, I'll start with
<br>
pretty (frontpage for that, to produce a skeleton page), code up any library
<br>
asp that needs doing, then put the two together.
<br>
<p>Handcoding is good for generating html in any server scripting language,
<br>
good for doing the tricky/finicky stuff, but sorely unproductive for
<br>
producing the pretty interface.
