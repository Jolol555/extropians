</em><br>
<p><p>At some point, this attitude gives diminishing returns.  I have a strong
<br>
preference for standards based implementation, but only when it doesn't
<br>
diminish the results in some way.  Oracle is nearly as ubiquitous in the
<br>
database world as Windows is in the desktop world, so I don't feel bad
<br>
about writing some code in PL/SQL when called for, any more than I would
<br>
feel bad about writing part of a Windows app in VB if that was best
<br>
suited for the job.  Considering the shear numbers of people who know
<br>
PL/SQL, and the probability that it will be supported for many years into
<br>
the future, I don't see a problem with it from the perspective of a
<br>
business manager.
<br>
<p>Sure, I could do everything outside of the database using JDBC/ODBC and
<br>
the language of your choice (and many times I do), but I wouldn't
<br>
necessarily do it out of principle.  My client is paying for the best
<br>
solution to their needs, not for a solution that meets an abstract ideal
<br>
that can't be easily justified, particularly when a standardized
<br>
solution barely meets the required metrics (speed and scalability are
<br>
typically my given primary design goals).  Beside which, many &quot;standards&quot;
<br>
have fallen by the wayside faster than proprietary systems.
<br>
<p>I have to design for scalability and headroom, and so that is where I put
<br>
the engineering elegance.  I am not religious about language, as long as it
<br>
is reasonably clean.  A well-written code base in any reasonable language
<br>
makes the choice of language really a matter of aesthetics or cosmetics. 
<br>
In practice, I usually do most everything in open standard environments,
<br>
but for sections of a system with critical performance, I am not shy about
<br>
diving in and creating a custom tailored solution using proprietary tools. 
<br>
In PL/SQL land, that may mean that certain complicated transactions are
<br>
compiled into the database and accessed using standard APIs in something
<br>
like Java.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Oracle should be a vendor of relational dbms technology not busy locking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you in to having persistent solutions that work only on Oracle and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless on anything else.  
</em><br>
<p><p>While lowest common denominator solutions may be wonderful for a broad
<br>
class of applications, some require tighter integration than you'll find
<br>
with a standards based environment.  Business types don't care; Oracle is
<br>
a de-facto standard to them, unless they have a religious objection.  If
<br>
Oracle isn't an excellent tool for the job, I won't use it or recommend
<br>
it.  Fortunately, it is quite adequate as an enterprise database and is
<br>
usually the preferred database for many managers.
<br>
<p>One could argue that a standard database 4GL could be designed, but that
<br>
would defeat the purpose.  4GLs such as PL/SQL reflect the internal
<br>
details of the database and abstracting it would defeat most of the
<br>
advantages of a 4GL to begin with, since internals vary quite a bit
<br>
between major vendors.  But there is still a good argument for 4GLs,
<br>
since there is a substantial amount of opimization inherent in their
<br>
design.  Frequently I use JDBC/ODBC for database access instead of
<br>
native methods, but I do so knowing full well that it won't hold a candle
<br>
to native methods performance-wise; when performance is critical, I go
<br>
native every time. 
<br>
<p>In the business world, Oracle is a de-facto standard, just like Microsoft.
<br>
My clients don't want me to sacrifice the business solution on an arguable
<br>
philosophical premise.  &quot;Standard&quot; means different things to people from
<br>
the business world and the software engineering world.
