</em><br>
<p>One need not postulate a fixed human nature in order to observe 
<br>
characteristics shared by almost all humans at this point in time. If the 
<br>
subject of negotiation can't be defined at least for the time period 
<br>
effected by the negotiation, then negotiation does indeed seem pointless.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Secondly, one of the most unusual characteristics of the human animal is

<em>&gt;its remarkable developmental plasticity.
</em><br>
<p>I've spent quite a bit of effort studying the various ways of raising 
<br>
children. In every case I've seen or read about, humans function better if 
<br>
they're given a certain level of care when they're developing: good 
<br>
nutrition for the mother while the fetus is attached to her blood system; 
<br>
human milk, preferably directly from the mother's breasts, until the child 
<br>
self-weans (which usually takes place between years 3 and 5); the personal 
<br>
freedom to study the world and learn how things work; respect as 
<br>
intelligent humans from the time they begin speaking. When I say they 
<br>
function better I mean that they're happier, more intelligent, better able 
<br>
to make rational decisions, better able to cope with changing conditions, 
<br>
more self-confident, better able to interact with other people, kinder, 
<br>
better able to stand up for themselves in non-aggressive ways. I've seen 
<br>
this happen too many times to think it's merely luck. (Sarah Lawrence has a 
<br>
web site called Taking Children Seriously that I'd recommend for anyone 
<br>
who's interested in learning more about the way children respond to being 
<br>
treated with respect--a large part of this being respect of their nature as 
<br>
intelligent humans). The sort of freedom of choice and mutual respect that 
<br>
works for raising children also seems to work well for groups of adults.
<br>
<p>Behavioral flexibility is one of the most valuable human traits. But 
<br>
flexibility is not the same as plasticity. Plasticity implies being molded 
<br>
by someone else, against one's will, like the kids who've been diagnosed as 
<br>
&quot;ADDHA&quot; or whatever the current excuse is to force highly intelligent and 
<br>
energetic kids into sitting still in a classroom for seven hours a day 
<br>
pretending to listen to an excruciatingly boring teacher. Sure, you can use 
<br>
torture of this sort to shape kids. And you end up with people who are 
<br>
depressed, antisocial, maybe suicidal or homicidal. In any event, they're 
<br>
not optimally functioning humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You can take a human neonate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;teach it to communicate in a language that no other human has ever spoken
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if you get it young enough.
</em><br>
<p>Why would you want to do this? The purpose of human speech is to 
<br>
communicate with other humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You can make 'em behave in weird and wonderful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ways, some of them extremely self-destructive.
</em><br>
<p>I'd be interested to see an example of a wonderful behavior that's been 
<br>
instilled by force (I assume you mean force since you write of making 
<br>
people behave in certain ways).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You can also *modify* the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behaviour of adults, within some rather vague limits -- limits which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much broader than most of us would like to admit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (The Milgram and Zimbardo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;studies are a chilling example of just how far this can go.)
</em><br>
<p>Keep in mind that these studies were done on people who had been trained to 
<br>
act in certain ways from the time they were born. These were as much a 
<br>
studies of a culture as they were studies of human nature.  When a person 
<br>
is very small and her life depends on one or two adults, you don't have to 
<br>
use electric shocks and broomsticks up the rectum to keep her in line. Just 
<br>
leave her alone in a crib for hours at a time. Let her cry until she 
<br>
exhausts herself and falls asleep. Ignore her or treat her like she's 
<br>
stupid when she asks questions. Human nature is fixed to the extent that 
<br>
you get similarly unwholesome results in almost every case when you raise a 
<br>
kid using these techniques.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Nope, I don't agree with that. Why should there be no point in a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being negotiating with an AI living in a computer simulation of a universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where pi = 3.0?
</em><br>
<p>If your AI lived in a simulation where pi always equaled 3.0 negotiation 
<br>
might prove fruitful. If, OTOH, the AI called all the shots and pi 
<br>
sometimes equaled 3.0 and sometimes equaled 4.5 and sometimes didn't exist 
<br>
at all--I can't see any point in negotiating. If you're going to say that 
<br>
human nature is plastic; therefore we can't base social systems on human 
<br>
nature as it exists now--I'm going to immediately be on my guard when 
<br>
dealing with you. Especially when you start talking about MAKING me, or 
<br>
anyone else, do things.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You misunderstand the idea of human mutability. Society can turn around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tomorrow and decide that left-handed males of jewish descent (like me)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are criminal subhumans bent on its destruction; that IN NO WAY changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me. What it changes is *the way I interact with society*.
</em><br>
<p>I think you're contradicting your own argument here. You said earlier that 
<br>
human nature is malleable. &quot;You can also *modify* the
<br>
behaviour of adults, within some rather vague limits -- limits which are
<br>
much broader than most of us would like to admit.&quot; Perhaps you'd say that 
<br>
if you treat someone as subhuman, maybe throw them into prison, maybe don't 
<br>
feed them very well, maybe make them sleep on a wet, dirty floor--perhaps 
<br>
you'd say you're only changing their behavior and not changing their actual 
<br>
nature. Where does one end and the other begin? If one's behavior is 
<br>
altered to the extent that he dares not make his own decisions, dares not 
<br>
move without permission--have you changed the person's nature, or only his 
<br>
behavior?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;At the same time, if you upload my mind into a bush robot, my nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will have changed radically
</em><br>
<p>Are you sure about this? You've changed the nature of your body. But at 
<br>
what point would you say bodily changes equal changes in nature? What if 
<br>
you lose your right arm and have it replaced by a prosthetic? How about if 
<br>
you replace both legs?  New lenses in your eyes?  Skin grafts using 
<br>
artificial skin? Cosmetic surgery on your face? Injection of psychoactive 
<br>
chemicals into your bloodstream? At what point are you no longer you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  -- but if society recognizes non-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligences as citizens, this change in my nature *doesn't* affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my interactions with society.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I've properly understood the argument you were making above 
<br>
about human nature; but I think you're contradicting it here by assuming 
<br>
some characteristics that remain constant by virtue of your being an 
<br>
intelligent individual. The bush robot with a human mind would presumably 
<br>
still dislike being coerced, would act in certain ways if it were 
<br>
consistently treated as though it were stupid, would not be able to 
<br>
function optimally if it were not allowed to make its own choices based on 
<br>
its own decisions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;What you appear to be doing is assuming that society is a reified entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that exists in its own right, and that it can dictate the terms of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence.
</em><br>
<p>Is this Samantha you're talking about? I'd be interested to see exactly 
<br>
which part of her posts gave you this idea. I got quite the opposite 
<br>
impression.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   It isn't; it's simply a convenient way of representing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a gigantic bunch of one-to-one relationships that, in aggregate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;form a one-to-many relationship between the individual and everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around them.  It can exert social pressure on me,
</em><br>
<p>These sentences are contradictory. You speak of society as being merely a 
<br>
shorthand for 1-1 relationships. Then you make &quot;it&quot;--and I assume &quot;it&quot; 
<br>
stands for society in your last sentence--the subject of the verb exert. 
<br>
Either society is an acting entity or it's not. It's this sort of reasoning 
<br>
that makes it difficult to negotiate--when one of the parties to the 
<br>
negotiation changes definitions in mid-conversation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  but it can't force
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me to change.
</em><br>
<p>But individual people can force you to change, right?  (&quot;Secondly, one of 
<br>
the most unusual characteristics of the human animal is
<br>
<em>&gt;its remarkable developmental plasticity.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;However, if I *want* to change I can, and the act of so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing doesn't fundamentally change my relationship with society.
</em><br>
<p>Does it change your relationships with individual people? I would think 
<br>
some kinds of individual changes would alter your relationships with other 
<br>
individuals. For example, if you've previously been rude and belligerent 
<br>
and you become polite and tactful--I'd expect your social interactions to 
<br>
have a completely different character post-change than they had pre-change. 
<br>
And since society is nothing more than a mass of 1-1 relationships, you 
<br>
have changed your relationship with society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In other words, I'm a mutable individual, not a robot subject to the will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a collective.
</em><br>
<p>Are you not assuming some fixed human nature in this sentence?
