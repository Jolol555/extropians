</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This seems to be more an argument from intuitiveness than anything else.
<br>
That doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong.  Even so, what Brooks and Wiley
<br>
are getting at is that a lot of biological phenomena including evolution
<br>
(they also treat ontogeny and other phenomena) can be explained as instances
<br>
of increasing information entropy.
<br>
<p>Also, you seem to restrict &quot;evolution&quot; to progress.  I would not equate the
<br>
two.  Over time, evolving systems usually become more complex, but this does
<br>
not necessarily mean each component is all that complex.  Think of parasites
<br>
that lose everything but the ability to latch on to a host, feed, and
<br>
reproduce.
<br>
<p>&quot;Devolution&quot; is a term I would hardly use at all because it seems arbitrary.
<br>
Is the equine line losing toes an example of evolution or devolution?  What
<br>
about birds losing teeth?  The cetaceans adapting to an aquatic environment?
<br>
See what I mean?  To me, it's evolution, but then all changes over time at
<br>
that level are, to me, evolution in action.  I might be inclined to restrict
<br>
&quot;evolution&quot; to stuff that is irreversibly changed.  Thus, extinction is more
<br>
evolutionary than, say, those moths in England changing color.  The former
<br>
is permanent; the latter transitory -- i.e., the color trait is reversible.
<br>
(Of course, I would not use devolution at all.)
<br>
<p>That said, I'm a bit afraid of even doing that since it would bias
<br>
evolutionary theories in favor of ones that use thermodynamics, such as the
<br>
Brooks-Wiley one or Wicken's.  (We haven't gone over Wicken here.  I forget
<br>
the reference right now.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
