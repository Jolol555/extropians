<em>&gt;&gt; John Locke's &quot;Social Contract&quot;, a darn good idea, but we just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; adopted it. I agree with Heinlein, man has no &quot;Natural&quot; rights.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, it was Rousseau who came up with the 'social contract',
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but this was not a social contract of trust as I speak of in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;article at exi-freedom, but of socio-economic dependency and debt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which Bakunin refined to include the individual's debt to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assets created by the labor of the dead in their lifetimes.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, according to the Internet encyclopedia (thanks Jimminy)
<br>
of philosophy it was Hobbs in chapter 13-15 of &quot;Leviathan&quot; who
<br>
first defines the social contract, Locke and Rousseau developed it
<br>
from there.
<br>
<p>I always remember Locke's version because Jefferson (Thomas)
<br>
mentions him so often.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The rest of the world functions on the delusion that 'society' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some living entity independent of the individual, and ludicrously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believes that the individual cannot survive without 'society' as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if he/she were merely a cell of the 'society' organism. The rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the world claims that the individuals rights are granted to it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by society, with society's sufferance, and can be rescinded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'society' deems necessary. This is pure fascism, simply put. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an evolution of the old 'divine right' principle by which kings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reigned over their serfs, where there is only one true sovereign,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the king, who is now represented by the government, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presumed to be the thinking organ of the 'society' organism.
</em><br>
<p>I see government as the result of social contract, I do not
<br>
recognize &quot;society&quot; as other than the other members of the 
<br>
human species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is not surprising that the idea of the sovereign individual is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under assault even here in the US. The last century of immigration
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by people infected by socialist memes to the US has created our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;culture war. The 'Meme War' described by Steven Barnes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Kaleidoscope Century&quot; exists here and now. Heinlein never said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that man has no natural rights, and his novel &quot;The Puppetmasters&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was an allegory to explain my argument here. The bug parasites
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represent the 'society as organism' meme.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't buy the con, Brian. Man has natural rights because he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolved under the laws of physics and biology to be the creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he/she is. Natural Rights describe the evolved native capabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the human animal in a state of nature. The human animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survives best when he/she is free to communicate, associate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonder and worship, accumulate property, travel, and hunt and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defend themself against agressors. Its NATURAL.
</em><br>
<p>This seems to be merely a matter of semantics. If I was the only
<br>
individual on the planet, there would be no laws other than those
<br>
I imposed on myself. I of course under these circumstances would
<br>
have no rights, and need none.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Nor does this mean that extropy is against natural rights, either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Evolution is the rule, and evolution is about improvement,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimization to the environment. As we expand our environment into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space and into cyberspace, it is our potential to evolve to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survive in these environments, and that we have the naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolved ability to aid in our own evolution demonstrates this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our natural right. Those that oppose extropy oppose natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights.
</em><br>
<p>I see this as semantics again. My lone individual above hopefully
<br>
evolves, but does only what he chooses to do, and the laws of
<br>
physics allow. He has no rights, natural or otherwise.
