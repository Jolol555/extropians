<p>One week should be enough.  My notion is that currently organ
<br>
transplant patients need to take major immunosuppressants because
<br>
of non-optimal tissue matches.  When the organs become available
<br>
they have only a few hours, so they grab the locals, regardless of
<br>
optimal suitability.  Perhaps if transplants *worked* better, more
<br>
people would sign up to donate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll discuss it with Henrik Ohrstrom, he has started working at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transplant clinic recently and should be getting up to date on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject.
</em><br>
<p>Do ask him if there are better/worse tissue type matches, and
<br>
if the less optimal fits require more drugs and have less success.
<br>
Im way outta my area of expertise here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, why remove the head in the first place?
</em><br>
<p>In order to freeze it.  My idea is this: offer head freezing in exchange
<br>
for total organ donation.  I imagine the total worth of ones organs
<br>
far exceeds the 30k or so required to freeze a noggin.  This also
<br>
saves the family the cost of a funeral and a grave site, as well as
<br>
getting us around the ethically sticky issues surrounding the sale
<br>
of transplant organs.  Let some nonprofit bear the cost of freezing
<br>
us, and also collect the compensation for your remaining salvagable
<br>
parts.  Then organ recipients would simply buy what they need,
<br>
and any leftovers could be donated to the poor.  Everyone wins.  spike
