</em><br>
<p>This is why your methods are so offensive to the rest of the list. 
<br>
Your goals (in this case only) do not match the goals of the list. 
<br>
You are spamming hundreds of extropians with messages that are not 
<br>
really directed to them, but are part of your master plan.  You are 
<br>
using this list, not for extropian conversation, but for political 
<br>
maneuvering to catch an opponent in a political position.  The rest 
<br>
of us on this list are not oblivious to your machinations.  We have 
<br>
been forced to endure this entire episode intermixed with our list 
<br>
data stream, knowing full well that it was not directed toward us or 
<br>
related to list business.
<br>
<p>Your on-topic posts are certainly interesting and welcome!  However, 
<br>
I think I speak for many on this list when I ask that you not involve 
<br>
us or this list in your political battles in the future.  Postings to 
<br>
this list should only be made for the benefit of the list members and 
<br>
should be limited to discussion of extropian ideas.  Other usages of 
<br>
this list outside its intended purpose is a form of abuse.
<br>
<p>Please consider this position the next time you find yourself in a 
<br>
similar situation in the future.
