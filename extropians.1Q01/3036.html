<em>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16561.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/16561.html</a>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ugh, but The Register's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all-corporations-and-governments-are-out-to-screw-you point of view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more objective? :)
</em><br>
<p>No, of course not!
<br>
<p>I like The Register specifically because they don't try to be objective.
<br>
It's obvious what their bias is, and they relate stories in provocative ways
<br>
that give one something to think about. Most other news sources are, well...
<br>
just plain dull, and they make it much harder for one to see what their bias
<br>
is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Everyone entering Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sunday was subjected to the surveillance system cameras, set up at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the entrance turnstiles. No notice or disclosure was ever given, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;no one, therefore, had an opportunity to decline to enter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stadium if they should have objected to this unprecedented treatment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would having extra security at a big event like the Super Bowl be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a reason to give notice?  Were they doing brain scans or illegally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tapping cell phones or something?  Would having extra officers there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been a reason to give notice?  Of course not.
</em><br>
<p>I don't necessarily agree with the opinions of this reporter on this issue.
<br>
<p>However, I find it very good that they wrote the article the way they did.
<br>
With that kind of media coverage (vs the &quot;objective&quot;
<br>
we-don't-care-we-just-report-it kind of coverage), people are more likely to
<br>
think seriously about such issues, to spot any misuse of these potentially
<br>
dangerous technologies, and to make those who are responsible answer for any
<br>
questionable decisions before it is too late.
