</em><br>
<p>There's another issue that the US is notorious for: inflexible and
<br>
draconian law enforcement.
<br>
<p>Example: suppose I smoke a joint in public. Posession of Cannabis, a
<br>
schedule D controlled substance, is illegal here (in Scotland). Maximum
<br>
sentence for posession is a £2000 fine (roughly US $3000) for a small
<br>
amount -- prison sentences for larger quantities. But *in practice*
<br>
if I smoke a joint in public and a police officer notices, one of two
<br>
things will happen: they'll ignore it, or they'll take it off me, throw
<br>
it down a drain, and formally caution me that if they see me doing it
<br>
again they'll charge me. In the current climate, to be arrested and
<br>
charged I'd have to be extremely unlucky (or provoke the cop in some
<br>
way).
<br>
<p>(Note that you're much more likely to be formally cautioned or arrested
<br>
in Glasgow, than over here in relatively laid-back Edinburgh.)
<br>
<p>Anyway. The point I'd like to make is that if the law was enforced rigidly,
<br>
I'd be £2000 poorer for that joint. What's going on here is the exercise
<br>
of institutional leniency; the cop who ignores or issues a caution knows
<br>
that their senior officer isn't going to jump on them if they find out.
<br>
The unwritten policy of leniency is condoned from the top down, with
<br>
approval sideways from the judiciary (who don't want their time wasted
<br>
prosecuting people for posessing a single joint) and politicians (most
<br>
of whom these days have a passing familiarity with the herb and aren't
<br>
inclined to clutter up the courts).
<br>
<p>I believe that if leniency is routinely applied in this way there exists
<br>
a strong argument for abolishing the law in the first place; but the point
<br>
is, there's a strong tradition in law in Scotland (and England) for the
<br>
judicial apparatus to refrain from prosecuting all crimes to the maximum
<br>
extent. I suspect this dates in part to the late 18th century and the
<br>
institution of the Bloody Code -- under that legal set-up, roughly 50% of
<br>
sentences were commuted on appeal, and it was a good thing too, because
<br>
the penalty for stealing a loaf of bread could be hanging or exile and
<br>
slave labour for life. Today, the Procurator Fiscal (in Scotland --
<br>
the Crown Prosecution Service in England) may decide to drop criminal
<br>
proceedings if they don't think it's appropriate to proceed. (For example,
<br>
this usually happens in cases of assault or homicide in self-defense
<br>
where the situation is unambiguous.)
<br>
<p>Now, I have a distinct impression that there is *no* facility of leniency
<br>
in US law enforcement today. That is, a police officer who turns a blind
<br>
eye to a trivial offense is going to be in fear of their job (at best);
<br>
that there's a positive requirement that *all* offenses be prosecuted to
<br>
the hilt. This may be a reaction to selective under-enforcement earlier
<br>
on in your history, but from the outside it looks frighteningly 
<br>
totalitarian. What is justice, without the prerogative of mercy?
