</em><br>
<p>Yup, agreed. This, incidentally, is one of the reasons I have a problem
<br>
with natural rights derived from some definition of human nature -- it
<br>
replaces behaviour mandated by fiat (&quot;you'll do things my way because
<br>
I say so&quot;) with behaviour mandated by appeals to nature (&quot;you can't do
<br>
that -- it's unnatural&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly both more complex and more memetically ingrained than the modern idea 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or practice of state authority.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;          ...  The prospect of equipping people driven by tribal ethnic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passions and who do not possess ingrained cultural restraints derived from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect for individual autonomy and private property with the technologies of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mid-21st century is surely the greatest threat to our survival,
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't presume to have an answer to this question, but one thing I know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't help us find solutions is the more potent form of &quot;cultural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativism&quot;, which prohibits the passing of judgments on cultures different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from our own.
</em><br>
<p>The taboo on passing judgements seems to me to arise from an inability to
<br>
conceive of the validity of a *subjective* judgement.  (Which, I suspect,
<br>
arises because these people think they've discovered the One True Way --
<br>
something on an internal contradiction in their belief system, no?) It's
<br>
also a problem for those people who can't differentiate between folklore
<br>
and a testable theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                   ...  His discussion of the prisoners' dilemma unfortunately 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be an afterthought, rather than a fundamental analytical tool.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems he is unaware of the powerful insights provided from iteration of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classical prisoners' dilemma, although he ALMOST works it out on his own.  
</em><br>
<p>The iterated prisoner's dilemma is the most powerful tool we've discovered
<br>
in attempting to build a solid ethical framework without appeals to human
<br>
nature, god's law, or the divine right of kings. You can sum up most of
<br>
my previous &quot;ethics in a void&quot; piece as an application of iterated PD
<br>
scenarios to human relationships. (And &quot;do unto others as you would be done
<br>
by&quot; is, not coincidentally, a starting position for the winning &quot;tit for tat&quot;
<br>
strategy.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Theoretical concerns aside, I believe that the weakness engendered by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural relativism poses a fundamental threat to survival over the coming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades.  Some cultural values and practices WORK in the modern world and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others don't.  Some tend toward peace and prosperity, and others tend toward 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violence and poverty.  Not only do we have to be able to SAY this, we have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to ACT on this realization.
</em><br>
<p>By my definition, cultural relativism is a *winning* position. But I'm
<br>
not talking about idiot academics who think that, because we can't be
<br>
certain we live in a perfect society, we cannot be allowed to criticize
<br>
anyone else. 
<br>
<p>I'd just like to note that the positions I'm opposed to are *all* absolutist
<br>
ones, and that I believe (at present) that moral absolutism is more likely
<br>
to lead us into error than a healthy dose of skepticism.
