<p>Press Releases | News About Viisage
<br>
<p>GRAPHCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. Provides Surveillance for Raymond James 
<br>
Stadium to Identify Known Suspects, Deter Crime
<br>
<p>On January 28th, Criminals No Longer Another Face in the Tampa Stadium Crowd
<br>
<p>Tampa, Florida, January 29, 2001 -Graphco Technologies, Inc. (G-TEC), 
<br>
a leading developer of technology and solutions for biometric 
<br>
authentication, secure access, and expert information-sharing 
<br>
systems, announced today that they provided a surveillance and facial 
<br>
recognition system at both the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa and at 
<br>
Ybor City, Florida. The system was in place from January 21 - January 
<br>
28, 2001 to monitor potential criminal activities during the sporting 
<br>
events and related activities at the two locations.
<br>
<p>In cooperation with the Tampa Sports Authority, Graphco Technologies 
<br>
partnered with Raytheon Company's (NYSE: RTNA, RTNB) Linthicum, 
<br>
Maryland office, Viisage Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: VISG), and VelTek 
<br>
International, Inc., to provide its FaceTrac facial recognition 
<br>
system to the Tampa Police Department and other federal, state and 
<br>
local law enforcement agencies.
<br>
<p>&quot;Not everyone comes to sporting events with good intentions,&quot; says 
<br>
David Watkins, G-TEC's Managing Director, &quot;The multiple distractions 
<br>
at the nation's premier athletic events provide criminals with 
<br>
opportunities to engage in a variety of illegal activities. G-TEC's 
<br>
facial recognition system provided the Raymond James Stadium with a 
<br>
superior surveillance system that not only captures images of 
<br>
individuals but also compares their facial features against a 
<br>
database of known felons.&quot;
<br>
<p>The FaceTrac core facial recognition technology provides the ability 
<br>
to locate faces, to build 'face print' templates and to recognize 
<br>
matches to images stored in a database. When integrated with G-TEC's 
<br>
law enforcement database, FaceTrac allows rapid search, comparison 
<br>
and identification of suspect facial photos within the database. 
<br>
FaceTrac may be used for surveillance with multiple locations 
<br>
networked to a high capacity site, for analysis and system-search 
<br>
results. G-TEC installed FaceTrac at the Raymond James Stadium as a 
<br>
single site system, integrated with a custom designed database and 
<br>
search result notifications for tracking faces in a crowd and 
<br>
monitoring access to secure areas.
<br>
<p>Tom Colatosti, Viisage President and CEO said, &quot;Places where large 
<br>
crowds are present, such as sporting events, are tempting targets for 
<br>
all types mischief, criminal behavior and larger threats. Using 
<br>
patented Viisage technology, G-TEC has introduced a new generation of 
<br>
tools for law enforcement officials to more effectively and 
<br>
non-intrusively provide for public safety. As an integral partner in 
<br>
the project, Viisage Technology provided G-TEC with the industry's 
<br>
leading and most robust face-recognition technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>Viisage Technology's FaceFINDER software drives the FaceTrac 
<br>
surveillance and identification process. Viisage's industry-leading 
<br>
face-recognition technology has the world's largest image database 
<br>
deployment in surveillance and investigative applications. Viisage 
<br>
also provided the project with image acquisition and integration 
<br>
technology and services.
<br>
<p>During the week of January 21st, G-TEC deployed the FaceTrac system 
<br>
throughout the Raymond James Stadium to detect and identify 
<br>
individuals who are wanted or suspect, and may present a danger to 
<br>
the public. Using standard cameras to recognize human faces during 
<br>
entry to the sporting event, FaceTrac continuously compared faces in 
<br>
the incoming crowd to an extensive, customized database of known 
<br>
felons, terrorists, and con artists provided by multiple local, state 
<br>
and federal agencies. A law enforcement task force of local, state 
<br>
and federal agency personnel monitored the system. Once individuals 
<br>
were matched with photo files in the database, officers of the joint 
<br>
task force, circulating throughout the complex, could be dispatched 
<br>
immediately to make possible arrests, quickly and discreetly.
<br>
<p>In addition to installing cameras supplied by VelTek International at 
<br>
the Raymond James Stadium, G-TEC adapted its FaceTrac capability to 
<br>
cameras in Ybor City, Florida to oversee the celebrations before and 
<br>
after the athletic events. Raytheon Company, a global developer and 
<br>
supplier of high-tech products and services, and a G-TEC partner, 
<br>
provided sophisticated cameras and expertise to provide police with 
<br>
exceptional night vision capabilities for poorly lit or darkened 
<br>
areas in Ybor City.
<br>
<p>G-TEC, headquartered in Newtown, PA, develops, manufactures, and 
<br>
markets secure database and secure communications systems worldwide. 
<br>
G-TEC combines information sharing, biometric authentication, secure 
<br>
access, and secure data facility technologies to provide technical 
<br>
infrastructure and applications in support of public and private law 
<br>
enforcement, corporate security, manufacturing, and secure 
<br>
web-enabled virtual communities. G-TEC's Intrapol Analysis Center 
<br>
offers secure-access data storage, sharing, and secure virtual 
<br>
community systems to corporate and law enforcement entities at the 
<br>
local, regional, state, national, and international levels. Graphco
