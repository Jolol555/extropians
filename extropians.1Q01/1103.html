<em>&gt;There is an excellent CD-ROM available for book-learning about firearms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as an adjunct to real training from a real live instructor. I'll post
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the URL if there's interest.
</em><br>
<p>i would be very interested in any URLs that people can give me on firearm 
<br>
information. and please, keep the opinions coming! the question, what's the 
<br>
best gun for a newbie college student in salt lake utah, with no underworld 
<br>
fears, for self defense! i don't need to drop waves of folks, or bank 
<br>
robbers with body armor and autoloaders(paintball term, kill me) just want 
<br>
to feel secure, and get some experience with firearms. a friend is pushing 
<br>
glocks in .40, the 23, i think is the compact?
