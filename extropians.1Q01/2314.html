<p>It doesn't take much brains to pick an existing peer-reviewed 
<br>
cryptosystem off the shelf, and implement it in hardware at the 
<br>
end device cost ranging from zero to few $.1. Such a thing will 
<br>
be effectively unbreakable. Personalizing each piece of hardware 
<br>
with a unique key is also possible. It is rather difficult
<br>
to copy a piece of software which is encrypted for a specific 
<br>
CPU (notice that this will somewhat hobble the performance, and 
<br>
make the thing visibly more expensive). Physical data carriers 
<br>
will go away for distribution, so encrypting something on the 
<br>
fly can be very easy indeed, just an extra step of an online
<br>
purchase. Notice that in a similiar way you can lock out 
<br>
software which is not vendor approved (see Playstation2, Sony has 
<br>
managed to outmicrosoft Redmond on this one). If all inter-die 
<br>
traffic is encrypted, you don't have a lot of leverage. Even if 
<br>
you disassemble the die package, and use some rather expensive 
<br>
and rare equipment, all you get is your unique key. It doesn't 
<br>
help other users if you break the scheme.
<br>
<p>I don't see smart end users subsidizing decreased functionality at their
<br>
end. Strangely, there are a lot of people who feel strongly about this,
<br>
and they're ready to pay extra dollar for a device without a &quot;Big Brother 
<br>
Inside&quot; sticker. As long as there are alternatives, and as long as it's 
<br>
not globally outlawed there will be always alternatives. Sooner or later 
<br>
we'll be moving into low-threshold production of IT systems, eventually 
<br>
approaching desktop range. At some point trying to control hardware will 
<br>
look very much like trying to control xeroxes. (Sure, color xeroxes have 
<br>
hidden watermarking, but eventually this doesn't matter as you can xerox 
<br>
xerox machines and design new ones from scratch).
<br>
<p>Of course, the outcome is largely dependent on the percentile of sheeple
<br>
in the total population, and how much leverage the IP mafia will be
<br>
able to gain. This is war, without doubt.
