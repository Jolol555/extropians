<em>&gt; All true, Mike.  I don't dispute anything you said.  California does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a power deficit such that it must buy power from the outside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, we did not see those outside suppliers run out of power.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have not seen other states suffer blackouts such that they could no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer supply California.  When President Bush ordered the power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned back on, we did not see an inability to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we did see is outside suppliers ready to sell power to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California as soon as they came up with the money.  What we did see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is outside suppliers go ahead and supply the power after President
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush ordered them to do so.  Now California is trying to figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to pay for the power now that the utilities are out of money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody opened up new oil wells or struck new veins of coal to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional power.  What they are opening up are new bank rolls to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchase existing power, bankrolls that will probably come from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxpayers eventually.  We need to fix the cost recovery pricing for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electricity and the incomplete deregulation that lead to this mess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do not need to produce more energy to solve California's problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of last week.  We need new energy sources to solve our over-all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems of the future.
</em><br>
<p>What the utilities did was crank up old power generators that had been
<br>
shut down due to the excessive pollution they generate. Bush is excusing
<br>
them from liability under EPA regs for the pollution, but there is still
<br>
more acid rain falling in the northeast because of it, and our local air
<br>
quality goes down the tubes because power plants in the midwest are
<br>
cranking out the smoke. We have to use MBTE tainted gasoline as a
<br>
result, and  so our local water supplies get polluted permanently.
<br>
California is exporting its pollution, and multiplying it in the
<br>
bargain.
