Here is the latest news on the automatic speed limiters testing:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,425344,00.html">http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,425344,00.html</a>

<p><em>&gt; 'Promising' tests on car speed limiters extended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Martin Wainwright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saturday January 20, 2001
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Guardian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The government has commissioned a trial of speed limiters in cars, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could lead to computer-controlled overrides as a standard fitting within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; five years. Twenty trial vehicles will be fitted with a system which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won praise on a prototype Ford Escort driven over thousands of rigidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monitored miles in the past three years. The tests, which prevented the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car from topping 30mph, 40mph and other limits, were &quot;highly reliable&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to the Institute of Transport Studies at Leeds University, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has won funding for the expanded trials from the Department of Transport,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Environment and the Regions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We've had two dozen people driving along a 40 mile route, including the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A1M motorway,&quot; said Oliver Carsten, head of the project, which has also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been demonstrated on the north circular road in London.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The system uses a computerised navigator linked to the car's electronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controls and a positioning satellite. Areas with speed restrictions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fed into the system to trigger action as soon as a limit is breached.

<br>
<p>So, while this may be a &quot;good&quot; application, it does appear that society is
<br>
gaining more and more powerful technology which will be used to enforce
<br>
objectives which the majority in a society accept as &quot;good&quot;. This will be
<br>
unfortunate for minorities and perhaps society as a whole should pay more
<br>
attention to the rights of minorities. Just because they are &quot;different&quot;
<br>
doesn't mean they have to be fined or locked up.  Where does being
<br>
&quot;different&quot; shade into being &quot;criminal&quot;?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, this technology is not being used to fine people or to
<br>
lock them up. Instead it is being used to make the unwanted (criminal?)
<br>
behaviour impossible to carry out. This seems a less threatening way for the
<br>
authorities to behave. It is like developing an immunisation jab that makes
<br>
pot have no effect on people, or an added ingredient to beer that stops
<br>
people getting drunk, or a car that refuses to drive with a drunk driver,
<br>
etc. Is it likely in future that there will be far fewer people in prison
<br>
because more &quot;crimes&quot; will become impossible to commit?
