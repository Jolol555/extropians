</em><br>
<p>To be technical, the man in the middle attack is not an &quot;attack&quot; 
<br>
against an existing securely established relationship.  It is a form 
<br>
of fraud or con wherein one is persuaded to set up a new secure 
<br>
relationship with someone untrustworthy.  That means that if you 
<br>
personally know someone and set up proper secure communications with 
<br>
them, the man-in-the-middle con cannot break it (theoretically).
<br>
<p>This con only works if you are trying to set up a new relationship 
<br>
with a stranger to do business.  The man-in-the-middle is a stranger. 
<br>
You set up secure communications with him.  No one else can break 
<br>
into your secure communications (theoretically).  Therefore, the 
<br>
system worked as designed.  The problem is not with the encrypted 
<br>
communications.  The problem is with dishonorable people at the other 
<br>
end.
<br>
<p>This problem always exists, whether someone has interposed a 
<br>
man-in-the-middle or not.  The person on the other end of the 
<br>
communications must be trusted.  If he is not trustworthy, he is a 
<br>
break in security.  No fix on the communications pipe will solve the 
<br>
problem of dishonorable people.  Even if the person on the other end 
<br>
is not a pre-arranged man-in-the-middle, he still can turn out to be 
<br>
untrustworthy and could pass along your secret messages to any third 
<br>
party.
<br>
<p>I do not believe any amount of technology on the communications pipe 
<br>
will be able to solve the problem of untrustworthy humans on the 
<br>
other end.  A different solution for trusting or controlling business 
<br>
partners would need to be found.
<br>
<p>One possible solution for some cases would be full anonymous cash. 
<br>
If you could do business anonymously and still get paid, you wouldn't 
<br>
care what the person did on the other end.  In this case, you 
<br>
wouldn't need your messages to be encrypted, merely that your 
<br>
messages could not be traced back to you.  This is a different 
<br>
solution to a different problem, but might solve some business 
<br>
requirements for e-business.
