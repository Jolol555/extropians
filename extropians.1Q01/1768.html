</em><br>
<p><p>With respect to ASP/IIS/SQL Server, not just no, but *HELL NO*.
<br>
<p>Those skills are quickly becoming unemployable.  Over the last year or two
<br>
I have been involved in several large migrations away from these
<br>
platforms, and most everyone else I know who has been involved with a
<br>
company that uses ASP is doing the same thing.
<br>
<p>Forget ASP, Java will be more employable, both now and *especially* in the
<br>
future.  I don't know of anyone migrating from Java to ASP, but I know of
<br>
several going the other way.  That and most new development seems to be
<br>
done in Java for the most part.
<br>
<p>SQL Server was never a big player.  Learn Oracle and you'll be employed
<br>
forever.  Oracle Server is one of those few ubiquitous enterprise products
<br>
that I actually feel comfortable predicting most businesses will
<br>
still be using in 5 years. 
<br>
<p>IIS?  Well, I've seen the Netcraft results, and every shop I know that is
<br>
currently using it is either in the middle of a migration or planning one
<br>
to Apache.  Hell, I know of shops that use Apache on Windows NT for
<br>
production systems...
<br>
<p><p>If I was going to recommend environment skills for someone looking
<br>
strictly for marketability I would have to strongly recommend
<br>
Java/Apache/Oracle.  This will allow you to hit the biggest market segment
<br>
with most staying power.  For better or worse, this is where the market is
<br>
at and where it will be going, at least for the next few years. 
<br>
(Thankfully -- I've used ASP/IIS/SQLServer on projects and it makes me want
<br>
to hurl.  Oracle and Java have their problems, but they are a good bit
<br>
better than the MS solution in this case.)
