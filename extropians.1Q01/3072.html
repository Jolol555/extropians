But, see, this is the problem--what's okay for them ain't okay for 
<br>
you and me. Case in point: Cops in many jurisdictions are now wearing 
<br>
mics on traffic stops. Some are wearing cameras, in addition to the 
<br>
dash-mounted cams. Guy in MA, I believe it was, audio-recorded the 
<br>
cops stopping him and brought it up in court to support his 
<br>
contention that he was harassed. Result? He was convicted of 
<br>
illegally recording the cops. Last I heard, the officers were also 
<br>
considering civil suits.
<br>
<p>Go figure.
