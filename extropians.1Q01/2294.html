<em>&gt; I'm not really sure what world you're living in.  Apparently you feel that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is impossible to program anything useful in Visual Basic or even any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other Microsoft tool. 
</em><br>
<p>Where the heck did I say that?  I don't think I did. In my previous job
<br>
I spent 3 years doing nothing but MS (mainly C++/COM and a bit of VB). 
<br>
I didn't say you can't write decent programs in all MS environments.  I
<br>
will say you can't write much more than toys in VB.  Everything serious
<br>
I needed to do with it depended on having a COM library written in
<br>
another language (usually C++) or my writing some components in C++.  VB
<br>
as of VB 6 is seriously broken as a development tool both from its
<br>
language characteristics and limitations and its packaging.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was personally involved in a VB project that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enabled Carolina Power and Light's bulk power marketing team the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sell and buy excess power thus adding millions of dollars to the company's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bottom line.  This was a 24/7 application that was written entirely in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Visual Basic 5 using an Oracle back end.  Stupid me, I didn't know anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about stored procedures back then, but dang it if the thing didn't work just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine in spite of my lack of Oracality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  You can find somethings that VB's build in stuff (well actually
<br>
plus whatever DB libraries you were using which were not (most likely)
<br>
written in VB5 (for sure Oracle's drivers weren't)) is adequate for. 
<br>
This doesn't change the fact that it is a weak language and a poor
<br>
development environment.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am currently involved in an application at Honeywell which uses multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components written in Visual Basic 6.  Oh dear, since this software is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horrible, it must be a big mistake!  Nope, works just fine.  Does the job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Components in VB6 are limited in that they can only use a subset of COM
<br>
and its threading abilities.  If that subset is sufficient for this app
<br>
then you are fine, for this app.  That still doesn't make VB6 a fine
<br>
tool for general programming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Intel, *gasp* uses Microsoft technolgies.  Intel, Samantha, is a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company.  And they use Microsoft technologies, including Visual Basic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Active Server Pages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That doesn't mean they are great either, does it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It makes me wonder, if Visual Basic is such a &quot;weak&quot; tool, why so many huge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succesful companies bank on it...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Because a lot of them were sold a MS bill of goods and wouldn't know
<br>
good software tools and environemnts if they bit them in the ass?
<br>
<p>You have been on enough projects, as I have, to know that tool decisions
<br>
are not often made for exactly rational reasons.
