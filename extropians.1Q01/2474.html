<br>
I'll stick my neck out here (because I am *not* sure that what I'm
<br>
about to assert makes sense and is internally consistent) and say that
<br>
human beings are not intelligent, in absolute terms: however, we're
<br>
just sufficiently intelligent enough to communicate abstract rules for
<br>
re-programming our own individual and collective behaviour. Call them
<br>
memes if you like. 
<br>
<p>(If you like, we're as dumb as it's possible to be and still be
<br>
a virtual machine for running memes on.)
<br>
<p>Because of our neurological plasticity, we can support a wide range
<br>
of different behaviours, both at the individual and collective levels.
<br>
Asking what is the optimum set of behaviour for a human society to run
<br>
on is therefore a bit like asking what is the optimum operating system
<br>
for a cluster of computers to run -- it depends what task you're trying
<br>
to accomplish. Some possible designs are obviously faulty, and end up
<br>
crashing all their hardware very rapidly. Others show differences in
<br>
performance; yet more only operate at peak efficiency when under external
<br>
stress (e.g. the application of a rule of terror to a centrally planned
<br>
police state). But we're probably not going to find an effective way of
<br>
distinguishing between competing viable designs that show near-ideal
<br>
performance. Indeed, it may be that there are *multiple* optimal sets
<br>
of rules for governing human behaviour.
<br>
<p>I don't like teleological arguments, but if there's any trend to our
<br>
development since H. Sapiens Sapiens emerged, it's towards generating
<br>
and transmitting ever more complex memes. Recently we (that is: some of
<br>
our memes) figured out how to build other machines that may, in time,
<br>
act as substrate for memes to colonize; if/when this happens, our memes
<br>
will no longer be restricted by our wetware.
<br>
<p>(Hell, I just sold two novellas about this to Isaac Asimov's SF magazine.
<br>
Go read.)
<br>
<p>As for our the technocapitalist economy/volitional
<br>
philanthropy/libertarian government idea, that's merely one possible
<br>
social operating system among many -- and one that is selected for a
<br>
high probability of producing alternate virtual machines for our memes
<br>
to colonize. If you like, it's pandering to software bloat ;-)
