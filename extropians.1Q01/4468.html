<em>&gt; &gt; Quite. Ice-T was not once told to stop rapping.

<em>&gt; &gt; Time-Warner was told by

<em>&gt; &gt; Time-Warner to profit from the

<em>&gt; &gt; promotion of illegal activities like cop killing and

<em>&gt; &gt; the statutory anal

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They certainly do!  And Time/Warner was exercising
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And Time/Warner's OWNERS was exercising that right when they pulled it
<br>
from the market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heston took it upon himself to use the tactic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PCness to stop Time/Warner from continuing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associate with Ice-T.  I have no qualms with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Time/Warner's actions or the actions of the Board of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Directors.  My point is that Chuck used PCness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BRAGGED about in an anti PC speech.
</em><br>
<p>Being against cop killing isn't PC. Cops are 'fascist pigs', 'nazi
<br>
thugs', and regular beaters of blacks (who just happen to be resisting
<br>
arrest), according to the PC left.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is what makes PCness so powerful... when it is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alightment with your (general case) own values, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even think of it as &quot;PCness&quot;.  It's only when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your values are different from the current PC values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it becomes &quot;thought control&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, no. Political Correctness is not about being in line with my values
<br>
about who it is acceptable to kill or not kill. Political Correctness is
<br>
about using excessive legal force to generate conformity with a
<br>
political agenda by criminalizing previously minor innocuous behavior.
<br>
Cop killing has never been minor innoctuous behavior, neither has
<br>
publishing music that advocated killing cops.
