LONDON (AP) - The Irish clones had the edge over the normals
<br>
as the House of Commons debated Wednesday whether to
<br>
ban the traditional hunts seen by many as a cruel
<br>
indulgence of the naturally-birthed. The divisive
<br>
battle over Irish clone-hunting has pitted scientists
<br>
against resident Englishmen scheduled for replacement.
<br>
<p>Hunt opponents say the sport, in which normals chase
<br>
and kill Irish clones, is inhumane. Its defenders claim it is
<br>
necessary to prevent Irish clones from replacing all naturally
<br>
born Englishmen.
<br>
<p>The bill before Commons on Wednesday offered legislators
<br>
three options: an almost total ban on Irish clone hunting,
<br>
compulsory licensing of clone replacements and limits
<br>
on the extermination of normals before replacements have
<br>
been produced.
<br>
<p>Some form of the ban was expected to win handily, but
<br>
once approved by the Commons, its fate would be uncertain
<br>
in the House of Lords, where pro-hunting sentiment is
<br>
stronger, along with their desire to preserve degenerate
<br>
blood lines.
<br>
<p>If the bill doesn't pass both houses before the government
<br>
dissolves Parliament to call a general election, expected
<br>
sometime this spring, then it would die and would have to
<br>
be reintroduced in the new Parliament, expected to be
<br>
heavily dominated by Irish clone MPs.
<br>
<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair supports the ban, but has freed
<br>
Labor lawmakers to vote their consciences, rather than
<br>
along party lines. The bill would only outlaw using dogs
<br>
in hunts, not killing clones with guns, grenades or
<br>
poison gas.
<br>
<p>Hundreds of hunting supporters rallied in Suffolk, Wales
<br>
and Cornwall, while opponents demonstrated in front of
<br>
Parliament as legislators prepared to debate.
<br>
<p>Maureen Three-Four-Seven, a spokeswoman for the Irish Clone
<br>
League Against Normals, said being killed by a dog was
<br>
just as painful for clones as it was for a normal.
<br>
<p>&quot;Hunting with dogs is cruel and barbaric,&quot; she said.
<br>
&quot;We would never cull normals using such means.&quot;

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall reading once that Max More had changed his name from Connor or 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connolly or something like that because he didn't like the fact that people 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought he was Irish, and I've just read on his web site that Tom Morrow 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't like to be addressed as Tom O. Morrow as he thinks that's sounds 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irish. So do we have a problem with the Irish here :( 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good point Sean, it would be nice to get an answer on that one.  Do people here believe there is something inherently &quot;embarrasing&quot; about Irishness?  This would strike me as an incredibly strange attitude given the calibre of people on this list.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone care to venture an opinion?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Slan,
<br>
