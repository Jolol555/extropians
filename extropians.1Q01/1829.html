<p><em>&gt; In normal countries like where I live ;-), nobody has a gun
</em><br>
<p>Normal huh?
<br>
<p>Pray tell what constitutes &quot;normal&quot;?
<br>
<p>Perhaps aggregate population?.....in which case Red China is normal....and 
<br>
you're right.....only their rulers are allowed freedom and firearms.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps &quot;normal&quot; (again like Red China...and the former Soviet Union) is a 
<br>
country in which all aspects of the slaves.....er...I mean the citizenry's 
<br>
........lives are regulated.....licensed ....taxed....and enforced by the 
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>Mayhap &quot;normal&quot; is a country in which an earthquake the likes of which 
<br>
california would  barely notice kills thousands? 
<br>
<p>Then again maybe &quot;normal&quot; is a country in which a large number of it's 
<br>
citizenry is anxious to LEAVE.....making the US decidedly ABnormal...since 
<br>
the only reason it's population increased was due to immigration.....having 
<br>
acheived ZPG among it's citizens...
<br>
<p>Perhaps &quot;normal&quot; is a country which receives welfare .......er....foreign 
<br>
aide....rather than distributes it?
<br>
<p>Perhaps some other definition of &quot;normal&quot;?
<br>
<p>I agree that the US is NOT normal...but we appear to 
<br>
be.....unfortunately....trending in that direction......more's the pity. 
<br>
<p>Especially if  &quot;normal&quot; means we have corrupt elected and appointed public 
<br>
officials........well........yeah......were pretty normal  in that regard....
<br>
<p>Hopefully this last election will delay...if not reverse...that trend..
<br>
<p>Be that as it may....
<br>
<p>You raise a point.  I propose that all guns be banned here too...but since 
<br>
that would be a major step and cause undue hardship to numerous parties I 
<br>
further propose that it be done in increments.
<br>
<p>First disarm all members of the Federal Alphabet soup agencies who now carry 
<br>
guns.....(DEA, FBI, BATF,CIA etc) and  also the Secret Service, US Forestry 
<br>
Service....Enviromental Proctection Agency.... and any other Federale who 
<br>
carries a firearm..
<br>
<p>Give it a few months.......perhaps a year........or two........what the 
<br>
hell.....let's give it five years......to  determine how well this strategem 
<br>
is working....
<br>
<p>IF it's working well...
<br>
<p>Why then...take it to the State Level....disarm all State officials and 
<br>
employees who currently care firearms....(highway patrol...state 
<br>
police....govenors mistress....etc)......
<br>
<p><p>As before...give it four or five years ...to see how well it works.....maybe 
<br>
ten.....(no need rushing into things).......then proceed on to the next step 
<br>
in the progression....
<br>
<p>Disarm all county officials.........(Sheriffs...prison guards...dog 
<br>
catchers...code enforcement officers......etc...)....
<br>
<p>Then city.....(police....truant officers....meter maids...mayors 
<br>
wife...)....and like that..
<br>
<p><p>Once that happens....if all works well....then I'll turn in my guns....maybe.
