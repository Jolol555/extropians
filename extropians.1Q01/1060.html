<p>Getting a long delay in an answer is useful intelligence, and an
<br>
untruthful answer, recorded on the archives, is also useful if it ever
<br>
comes out that he was (once again) lying through his teeth.
<br>
<p>While I admit I participated in baiting him, it was merely providing him
<br>
with the rope he hung himself with (once again), despite my best efforts
<br>
in trying to caution him against his folly. This time, not only did he
<br>
spam and flame the list (once again), but we documented him lying and
<br>
being hypocritical (and continued in this behavior after it was pointed
<br>
out to him, which is highly irrational), such that I think that its
<br>
rather clear to all and sundry that Mr Joe Dees is a troll, an extremist
<br>
with significant problems restraining himself verbally and a lack of
<br>
connection to reality, and a lack of ability to tell the truth, who sees
<br>
himself as a martyr of some sort, who will appoint himself as list
<br>
crusader and defender of the faith (despite being the one who was
<br>
previously kicked off the list, while I was not, contrary to his claims,
<br>
and despite nobody I know of asking him to do so).
<br>
<p>Despite my best efforts of encouragement, list members insist on talking
<br>
about that dreaded subject on this list. I won't stoop to the rude and
<br>
obnoxious methods Mr. Dees engages in, being the libertarian that I am.
<br>
It seems to me that the market is speaking. Is anyone hearing?
