</em><br>
<p>That depends on your legislative framework, and the context in which
<br>
your police force evolved. Different countries acquired formal police
<br>
forces at different times, and with different legal duties. For example,
<br>
in the UK the police forces have a legal duty to protect the public.
<br>
This doesn't mean they invariably do so, but if you call them because
<br>
someone is trying to break down your front door and they don't respond,
<br>
then they're failing to carry out their duty and you can raise several
<br>
shades of shit. (Whereas in the US, the police have no such duty -- 
<br>
their job is to enforce the law, not to protect the public.)
<br>
<p>I think the same sort of dichotomy applies to such a self-defense
<br>
gun. You'd need a legal framework to regularise their issue and handle
<br>
how their use should be treated -- a framework that would require the
<br>
police to treat the user as a potential _victim_ of crime, unless proven
<br>
otherwise. The biggest obstacle, of course, is the lone nutter syndrome --
<br>
the cops are going to be very leery about approaching someone who's just
<br>
used a self-defense gun in a friendly manner, in case they're actually
<br>
trying to commit suicide by cop. Hmm ... 
<br>
<p>Another widget to add to the gun: a remote control safety catch that the
<br>
police can engage and which temporarily disables any such guns within
<br>
a reasonable radius[*]. At the same time, the police are given a duty 
<br>
to respond urgently to such calls, to identify the participants, and to
<br>
arrest whoever first initiated the violence.  
<br>
<p>A typical scenario then looks like this: mugger attacks citizen. Citizen
<br>
pulls gun and tells mugger to back off. Mugger refuses, so citizen shoots
<br>
them. They get dyed, photographed, and the police are called. When the
<br>
police arrive, all the guns within fifty metres stop working while they
<br>
sort out who to arrest.
<br>
<p>Alternatively: loony shoots a brick wall, gets photographed and dyed,
<br>
calls police. Police show up. Loony tries to shoot cops -- only to 
<br>
discover that the gun doesn't work any more.
<br>
<p>Is this idea workable?
<br>
