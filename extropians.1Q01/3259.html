<em>&gt; While I found many of Hal's comments about surveillance of public spaces 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible, I don't think it follows that drug smuggling and sales will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer inordinately.  The packing and unpacking of containers hiding drugs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can take place in private spaces--places like homes and offices--which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal's analysis treats as not subject to the sort of surveillance he foresees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for public spaces.  For similar reasons, many sorts of drug transactions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can continue, so long as they move indoors.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is possible.  I suppose the drugs are packaged in ordinary
<br>
looking boxes and suitcases and such.
<br>
<p>It does seem that surveillance could still be very helpful to law
<br>
enforcement.  The increase in customer traffic in and out of drug
<br>
houses might be enough to justify a warrant.  Or, once a house had been
<br>
identified as a target in this way, police could trace back deliveries
<br>
to the house and see if they came from suspicious places.  Then, once
<br>
a dealer had been caught, the police would have information on who his
<br>
customers had been so they could try to target them as well.  Also,
<br>
the existence of cameras would make it harder for police to be bribed
<br>
to look the other way, which I think must be a common occurance today.
<br>
All these factors would make the drug business considerably riskier and
<br>
more difficult than it is today.
