<p>Oh, geez, more liberal 'we've gotta fix our problems here' tripe.
<br>
<p>a) space investment generates $14 in the economy for every dollar spent,
<br>
the highest of any government program in history (which typically return
<br>
$0.57 per dollar spent). b) Economic growth from space investment does
<br>
far more to 'fix our problems here' than liberal tax and spend nanny
<br>
welfare state handouts ever did. 
<br>
c) Note since the Apollo program was shut down in favor of funding the
<br>
Great Society, that program actually increased the number and percentage
<br>
of people living in poverty.
<br>
d) If we made it through this past century, the odds of human
<br>
civilization surviving the next one are pretty good (depending on what
<br>
your definition of 'human' is).
<br>
e) Your lack of understanding of exponential economics and technological
<br>
development forces me to condemn you to read the following works:
<br>
<p>The Peace War, Vernor Vinge
<br>
The Ungoverned, Vernor Vinge
<br>
Marooned in Realtime, Vernor Vinge
<br>
The Spike, Damien Broderick
<br>
The Last Immortal, James Halperin
<br>
The Truth Machine, James Halperin
<br>
The White Abacus, Damien Broderick
<br>
Diaspora, Greg Egan
<br>
Kaleidoscope Century, Steve/John??? Barnes
<br>
The Singularity Discussion, on Extropy Online
<br>
<p>and, to everyone, a book that is as close to a 'civilization building
<br>
manual' as I have read, &quot;Substance of Civilization&quot; by Steven Sass.
