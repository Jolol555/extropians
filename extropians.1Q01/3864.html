</em><br>
<p>I have no trouble with this concept at all, and have never indicated otherwise. But I'm more
<br>
interested in discussing how to achieve it rather than dismissing people by calling them names. To me
<br>
this involves being open minded and examining many different angles, rather than just vehemently
<br>
adhering to a fixed ideological position and lashing out at anyone who disagrees with me. I also
<br>
think it's important to be mindful of the many ways this system, like any system, could be
<br>
compromised or corrupted in order to keep it from happening. That's why I'm cautious, but optimistic.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Why do you assume that colonization is a burden? The British provided a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant level of industrialization, infrastructure development, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political and legal training that didn't exist whatsoever prior to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrival. They ended slavery, wife burning, religious genocides, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased the agricultural yeild of the nation such that it no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffers famines every 11 years.
</em><br>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, James Corbally's excellent response to the imperialism issue is pretty much
<br>
the final word. Since neither you nor I have experienced colonization, we're both being pompous and
<br>
arrogant to think we can say anything valuable on the subject. Since you continue to try to speak for
<br>
at least one group of conquered people, I can only assume you don't agree with this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think that everyone can and should be as free as possible. Many, IMHO, would dutifully choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaccept their chains and socio-cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baggage rather than accept the responsibilities of individual liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most immigrants who come to the US these days couldn't give a fig about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the concept of individual liberty. They come to get a job or get on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dole. They mouth the words of their oaths of citizenship then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately go about promoting ideas that directly contravene the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitution they have just sworn to protect and defend from all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemies.
</em><br>
<p>Since you can't honestly speak for everyone, this paragraph seems like a knee-jerk response to me,
<br>
and frankly, comes across as bigoted. If that's not your intention, I apologize.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Total the numbers and compare. Aztec society, and most Carribean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies, regularly practiced slavery, human sacrifice, body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutilation, and cannibalism. The level of accepted violence in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conquered societies as a matter of every day ritual was at least as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; severe as that practiced by eurpeans on them as a matter of systematized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy.
</em><br>
<p>So if we conquer these people and make them our slaves, it's okay because they're terrible anyway?
<br>
Talk about crap. How about letting people decide their own fates? This, to me, is what liberty is all
<br>
about. It doesn't mean you or I have to like or accept their way of doing things, just that we have
<br>
to let them work out their own destinies. How would you like it if someone who disapproved of your
<br>
way of life were to conquer you &quot;for your own good&quot;? Think about what you're saying here. Try to see
<br>
beyond your own biases.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Most revisionists tend to try to count epidemic deaths in their blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games when accusing europeans of 'genocide'. The fact is that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quarter to 90 percent of local populations perished when exposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; western diseases over a period of a few decades, long before anyone had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any idea of how disease was transmitted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What conflict actually occured is more properly described as low level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warfare, with one side almost constantly losing (indeed, the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British colonies in NA were under attack almost from the start).
</em><br>
<p>And why was there warfare? Because an outside group came in and tried to take over their land.
<br>
Wouldn't your response to this be the same? Wouldn't you fight the intruders?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, I'm with you on the humane over inhumane idea. I'm glad to hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this. And I would never claim it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all black and white. Quite the contrary, which can be evidenced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; looking at my other posts. Looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things only in black and white terms is one of the things I am objecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to here. Again, I think we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in agreement, but that you won't let go of your defense of imperialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While you don't seem to be able to let go of the idea that in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation, leaving despotic and evil cultural practices in place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unmolested is better than educating and improving through nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building efforts. Thats a rather black and white position you hold.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, Michael. Try to focus here. In the quote from me above, I say that I would never claim it's all
<br>
black and white and that, in fact, this B&amp;W way of looking at things is one of the things I am
<br>
objecting to here. Then you go right on accusing me of having a black and white position. Am I not
<br>
writing clear sentences here? I believe we speak the same language. And another thing, where exactly
<br>
do I say that &quot;leaving despotic and evil cultural practices in place unmolested is better than
<br>
educating and improving through nation building efforts&quot;? Nowhere. Please do not put words in my
<br>
mouth. All I have ever contended in regard to this (now rather tiresome) subject is that acts of
<br>
oppression cannot be justified in this way. Taking away someone's (or some group's, or some nation's)
<br>
liberty is wrong. Period. I don't care what positive outcomes can be pointed to centuries later by
<br>
apologists. If we are going to take the position that denying someone's liberty is wrong, then how
<br>
can you continue rationlizing colonization and imperialism? This does not compute. Even if you want
<br>
to call imperialism &quot;nation building efforts.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Imperialism wasn't about denying individuals their liberty, it was about transforming non-western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies so that they could appreciate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of individual liberty more.
</em><br>
<p>Oh please, give me a break. This is just more rationalization through hindsight. Why can't you, a
<br>
self-proclaimed advocate of liberty and self-determination, see how specious an argument this is?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sometimes that involved conflict and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violence dealing with adherents of the old order who wanted to retain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their 'right' to continue to oppress their people. If you insist that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have the right to oppress and be oppressed, then you must also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept the idea that some cultures cannot become libertarian or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic, and that some people cannot appreciate individual liberty.
</em><br>
<p>Again (yawn), I'm not saying this. Please don't put words in my mouth.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ah, 'taking into account the larger culture in which this took place'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damning the past from our own perceptions is a game that applies to all.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not doing this. I'm saying that even though Jefferson was wrong to own slaves, his actions can
<br>
only be understood in the broader cultural context of his day. In his society, slave-owning was
<br>
acceptible and &quot;normal,&quot; and only changed when enough of his contemporaries (and later generations)
<br>
worked to affect a change. This doesn't make his actions any less wrong, it simply provides a context
<br>
in which we can look at the situation critically rather than just damning him from our (more
<br>
enlightened) perspective.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I find it funny that leftists who claim to hate imperialism seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worship the idea of ancient Athens and its democracy, despite the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Athens was an imperialist nation that dominated the Greek world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with its Navy, while the Sparta that leftists decry as militaristic, etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was purposely structured to help avoid imperialism despite their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superiority in military arts.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm. Where did this come from? Since I have neither claimed to be a leftist, or mentioned ancient
<br>
Athens, I'm wondering why you threw this in. By the way, I agree with your assessment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; Why do you feel the need to label me a communalist when I have never once claimed to be one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communists have always claimed to not be communists until they took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power. I judge by what you say and do, not by what you claim about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself. If you espouse concepts that are communistic, socialistic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. then you label yourself. Revisionism, subjectivism, relativism, etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all propaganda tools of socialists and communists and are rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicative.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I see. I'm a communist because you say I am, even though I repeatedly tell you I'm not. This is a
<br>
weak and embarrassing way to conduct a discussion, and seriously undermines your credibility. And
<br>
just because certain rhetorical techniques are abused as tools of propaganda (which we all engage in
<br>
all the time, by the way, including you) by certain groups, it doesn't mean that anyone who uses them
<br>
AT ALL is somehow (unknown to themselves) a member of said group. This is ridiculous, and is the kind
<br>
of useless labeling I will continue to call you on. Oh, and I'm not interested in &quot;taking power&quot; over
<br>
anything except my own life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So am I. You regularly (as many 'anarchist' socialists do), pay lip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; service to opposition to government tyranny of the individual while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continually decrying corporate abuses of individuals and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequently, groups, despite the fact that governments abuse far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people than corporations ever have.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, so now I'm an &quot;anarchist socialist&quot;? Geez, make up your mind. And again, you totally
<br>
misunderstand and misrepresent what I said. I have clearly and repeatedly decried tyranny of all
<br>
kinds, not just that perpetrated by governments or corporations. Is this too clear for you? I'm not
<br>
interested in keeping a tally sheet on which group abuses people more, and I have agreed with you
<br>
more than once that governments have and continue to be worse than any other group. I have just
<br>
stated (and will state again) that this does not excuse the abuses that ARE committed by
<br>
corporations. Is this too subtle a distinction?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You regularly claim that abuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed by governments are actually just the governments being the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lackeys of corporations. This focus on corporations as if they are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary source of power is indicative of your primary orientation (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that of 'anarchist' socialists in general).
</em><br>
<p>Again, I have never said this. Why do you feel the need to make me into something I'm not? If you
<br>
need an enemy that fits this description, look elsewhere. All I have ever claimed in regard to this
<br>
matter is that corporations have and do commit acts of oppression, but ALWAYS in collusion with
<br>
governments. And I have repeatedly said that I am interested in looking at all factors, not just
<br>
blaming one group or another. Again, is this too subtle?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; People can and sometimes do commit evil acts. Should we thus confiscate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all individual liberties?
</em><br>
<p>Of course not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Portraying corporations as the greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil is thus disingenuous.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I never said this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't deny that any concentration of power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater than that of an individual is more prone to abuse than that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely from an individual with no more power than their own.
</em><br>
<p>I'm glad we agree on this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Trying to protect people from the consequences of their actions does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing but build up a debt of consequences that are devastating when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they (and the accrued interest) come due.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Life in general is caveat emptor. Refusing to accept this is as futile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as trying to refuse to accept gravity or e-mc^2. If you want to live a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better life, guess what? Its best done do-it-yourself.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you on this, and have never indicated otherwise. All I am calling for is a balanced
<br>
approach to examining the problems we are discussing here, one that doesn't resort to name-calling,
<br>
labeling or rigidly adhering to any one ideology. If this seems to fit your description of a leftist,
<br>
or a communist, or an anarchist, well, whatever. I prefer to think of myself as someone who tries to
<br>
think outside the box. Call me eclectic.
<br>
<p>fun as always, Neal
