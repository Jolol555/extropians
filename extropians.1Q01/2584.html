<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey! That's a great idea! Let's breed lots and lots of fissile plutonium

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Whether or not it produces plutonium isotopes depends on how it is

<em>&gt; &gt;I have the advantage of having taken a nuclear engineering course in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;college, as well as my father being involved in the construction of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;breeder reactor in the 60's at Hanford. Since your cite is an anti-nuke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;website, its rather obvious what their agenda is, and where their bias
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is. Their statement here is most certainly false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it possible to have a uranium breeder that does NOT produce plutonium -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or are you referring to a non-breeder reactor?
</em><br>
<p>I'll chat with pops, he still has lots of materials from the project,
<br>
incl photos of the reactor assembly he was in charge of building. It was
<br>
a liquid sodium breeder reactor all right.
<br>
<p>There may be plutonium in the rods as part of the transmutation process,
<br>
just as there is in any nuclear reactor. Not building breeders does not
<br>
serve non-proliferation, since Iraq, Pakistan, and India have done quite
<br>
well processing materials from normal water reactors. If
<br>
non-proliferation is the real interest of Greens, they should be pushing
<br>
for an amendment to the non-proliferation treaty that allows reps of any
<br>
signatory nation to inspect the facilities of any other nation at any
<br>
time. This is the primary solution to the problem, the lack of which is
<br>
why Saddam has gotten as far as he has.
<br>
The point of breeders is that when tuned for fuel elimination, they will
<br>
turn radioactive isotopes into non-radioactive isotopes that are
<br>
completely safe after being processed with water and other neutron
<br>
absorbers to absorb and remaining radiation.
