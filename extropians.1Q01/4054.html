The Cutting Edge of Cutting Calories
<br>
By Henry I. Miller
<br>
The Scientist 15[4]:39, Feb. 19, 2001
<br>
<a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2001/feb/opin_010219.html">http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2001/feb/opin_010219.html</a>
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad truth is that we're a bunch of fatsos, and getting
<br>
fatter. Sixty-one percent of adults are now overweight, anall-time
<br>
high, and more than a quarter are actually obese, or grossly
<br>
overweight, according to the 1999 National Health and Nutrition
<br>
Examination Survey just released by the Centers for Disease Control and
<br>
Prevention.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we get fatter and suffer from diabetes and high
<br>
cholesterol in record numbers, federal regulators aredrastically
<br>
limiting the availability of an important tool for controlling
<br>
calories. Five years ago the Food and DrugAdministration approved a
<br>
formidable weapon in the war against dietary fat: a cooking oil called
<br>
olestra, which adds no fat or calories to food. Simply a molecule of
<br>
table sugar linked to soybean or cottonseed oil, it is too large for
<br>
the body to absorb or digest. In 1996, after analyzing copious data,
<br>
consulting outside experts, and becoming convinced of the product's
<br>
safety during an eight-year review, the FDA permitted Procter &amp; Gamble's
<br>
olestra for use in chips,crackers, and other &quot;savory snacks.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, fat-free and low-fat olestra-containing versions of
<br>
five of the most popular chip brands in the United States have been
<br>
introduced by Frito Lay and Procter &amp; Gamble. Olestra has been a
<br>
considerable success, with morethan 3 billion servings sold in the
<br>
United States. If those consumers had chosen instead to eat regular,
<br>
full-fat chips instead of olestra-cooked chips, they would have
<br>
consumed an additional 225 billion calories and 33,000 tons of
<br>
fat.Olestra is a potential boon to public health in this country,
<br>
where diets are dominated by fat and three of the top four biggest
<br>
health concerns--heart disease, cancer, and elevated blood
<br>
cholesterol--are related to fat consumption.Olestra can help to lower
<br>
the proportion of fat and saturated fat in the diet, as well as cut
<br>
calories.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How widely might olestra be used? Consider that four of the top
<br>
five lunch/dinner entrees consumed in American homes could be made
<br>
lower in fat with such a versatile fat substitute: pizza (#1) could be
<br>
made with olestra oil; ham and turkey sandwiches (#2 and #5,
<br>
respectively) could contain olestra mayonnaise; peanut butter (on a
<br>
sandwich, #3)could be made with olestra substituted for peanut oil;
<br>
and hot dogs (#4) could contain leaner meat, with olestra added for
<br>
the satisfying &quot;mouthfeel&quot; of fat.
<br>
<p>While olestra causes mild gastrointestinal symptoms in a small number
<br>
of consumers, the frequency is no greater than with regular, full-fat
<br>
chips. A large clinical studyconducted by Johns Hopkins University
<br>
researchers, for example, showed no statistically significant
<br>
differences in reports of digestive symptoms in 1,000 movie goers
<br>
whoconsumed either olestra-cooked potato chips or full-fat chips
<br>
(without knowing which they were eating). Like the rest of us, these
<br>
test subjects couldn't eat just one: Median chip consumption was
<br>
greater than two ounces for both groups, and more than a quarter of
<br>
the test subjects ate more than four ounces of chips. (The typical
<br>
single-serving bag of chips is about one ounce.) This definitive study
<br>
was peer-reviewed before being published in 1998.1
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further compare the gastrointestinal effects of olestra to
<br>
another common food, researchers recently tested the effects of eating
<br>
five servings of olestra chips (five ounces) to eating less than two
<br>
servings of high-fiber bran cereal (a half cup). The persons eating
<br>
the wheat bran cereal experienced more digestive effects than those
<br>
eating the olestra chips.2
<br>
&nbsp;Other minor problems associated with olestra are similar to those of
<br>
many common foods. For example, milk and tea also bind vitamins and
<br>
minerals. Moreover, studies inprogress at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
<br>
Center in Seattle have found that the addition of the vitamins to
<br>
olestra snacks (which is done routinely) prevents any reduction in
<br>
overall vitamin availability.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond olestra's safety, recent research has revealed that eating
<br>
olestra-containing snacks correlates with various measures of improved
<br>
health. A study conducted by researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
<br>
Center found that people eating olestra snacks ate lower levels of
<br>
both total dietary fat and saturated fat, and they had lower levels of
<br>
unfavorable LDL cholesterol in their blood. The level of cholesterol
<br>
reduction (8 percent) was similar to that achieved with a high-fiber
<br>
diet.3
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers at the Nebraska Medical Center recently studied subjects
<br>
with early signs of heart disease who were fed either a high-fat meal or
<br>
an olestra-containing meal.4 The results showed that eating foods made
<br>
with olestra can provide significant benefits: After eating the meal
<br>
made with olestra, subjects had dramatic increases in cardiac blood flow
<br>
and a statistically significant reduction in blood triglyceride. While
<br>
similar results might have been achieved with a fat-free meal made
<br>
without olestra, we cannot ignore the importance of providing foods that
<br>
people will actually eat because they taste good instead of unpalatable
<br>
low-fat foods.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad news is on the political front. FDA regulators have been far
<br>
too conservative with this nutritional aid. They granted limited
<br>
approval, permitting olestra only for fried snacks, although the product
<br>
is uniquely versatile and can be used instead of margarine, lard,
<br>
butter, and other oils in frying, baking, and sautéing. The agency has
<br>
been unenthusiastic about additional uses, even though the safety and
<br>
usefulness of the product are unquestioned. Olestra is the most tested
<br>
food substance in history: Over the past 30 years, there have been more
<br>
than 150 animal studies and 100 human clinical trials involving more
<br>
than 24,000 adults and children--far more than the testing of most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prescription drugs.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;More bad news is that the FDA continues to require labels on
<br>
olestra-containing foods, warning about possible gastrointestinal
<br>
symptoms, in spite of repeated demonstrations that such problems are no
<br>
more frequent than for full-fat snacks. Such labels mislead consumers
<br>
and discourage wider use of olestra-containing products. As long ago as
<br>
June 1998, an FDA advisory committee criticized the warning label as
<br>
inappropriate. The FDA's promise to fix or eliminate the label by the
<br>
end of last year has gone unmet. If FDA won't be an actual advocate for
<br>
wider use of this boon to public health, they should at least &quot;do no
<br>
harm.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would federal health regulators unnecessarily restrict such a
<br>
desirable and popular product? They seem to have responded to the
<br>
opposition of a single radical group, the Washington, D.C.-based Center
<br>
for Science in the Public Interest. For more than a decade, CSPI has
<br>
forsworn both common sense and overwhelming scientific evidence in
<br>
attacking olestra.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not forget that CSPI is the brown rice and carrot juice
<br>
crowd that has warned us of the health horrors lurking in Mexican,
<br>
Chinese, and Greek food, and in movie theater popcorn--largely because
<br>
of the fat content. How ironic that this &quot;consumer&quot; group continues to
<br>
vilify a product that can help people reduce fat consumption in a
<br>
society where high-fat diets rank among the leading threats to public
<br>
health.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Widespread use of olestra could enable more people to adhere to the
<br>
American Heart Association's recommendation to consume less than 30
<br>
percent of total calories from fat. In public health impact, more
<br>
olestra in our diets could be tantamount to the recognition that
<br>
lowering blood pressure reduces heart disease and stroke. As a realistic
<br>
solution to Americans' constantly expanding waistlines and fat
<br>
consumption, olestra is the closest thing to a free lunch.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA's failure to promote--let alone to permit--wider use of
<br>
olestra represents the most lamentable kind of regulatory
<br>
decision-making. The regulators have been cavalier toward public health,
<br>
preemptive of consumers' freedom to choose, and punitive to a company
<br>
that spent hundreds of millions of dollars in good faith to develop a
<br>
safe and effective product.
