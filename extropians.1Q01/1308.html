<em>&gt;&quot;Societies get the government they deserve&quot; and all that rot. Societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that prefer high crime to individual liberty will get just that, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lists that prefer mentally unstable individuals posting rants and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;excretory comments demonizing other list members will get a list full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just that sort of person.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, most people won't wade through the flame-war to figure 
<br>
out who is right.  They will paint everybody with the same brush as 
<br>
being one of those involved.  Like Bill Cosby said about squabbling 
<br>
children, &quot;Parents don't want justice, they want quiet.&quot;  I do 
<br>
believe you are the reasonable one is this issue.  I just thought 
<br>
your explanation of deliberately baiting Joe seemed a little 
<br>
excessive.  I do agree that you were acting in self-defense.
<br>
<p>I'm trying to retain a reasonable position on all of this.  I don't 
<br>
like the (mis)representation that the gun topic is exiled to your 
<br>
list.  Although I was vocal in trying to hush the flame-wars and 
<br>
personal non-general-interest postings about guns, I would hate to 
<br>
see anything censored by topic in the extropians list.  I think 
<br>
rational discussions about guns are interesting.  I would hope that 
<br>
such discussion on extropians would go more toward theory and future 
<br>
developments of weapons rather than personal stories or current 
<br>
politics.
