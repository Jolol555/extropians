<p>
Chris Russo,
<br>
<p>We've pretty much covered this issue.  Your position is clear, and so is
<br>
mine. I want to thank you for a spirited discussion.  I particularly want
<br>
to let you know that I appreciate the way you've conducted yourself,
<br>
advocating your position forcefully, but with respect.  Demonstrating the
<br>
maturity implied by the old saying, &quot;People can disagree without being
<br>
disagreeable.&quot;
<br>
<p>So I'll make a few final comments, and close the book.
<br>
<p>In response to my comment,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Dr. Semmelweiss's ideas about sanitation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were once a 'fantasy'.
</em><br>
<p>you said,
<br>
<p>&quot;I would like to raise an objection to this tactic...
<br>
You take an idea that was eventually proven to be fact, and then use 
<br>
that as an analogy to show that your idea will eventually be proven 
<br>
to be fact.&quot; 
<br>
<p>An unintended (but not unwelcome--wink, wink) side benefit. Perhaps I was
<br>
using Semmelweiss as an example of how new ideas, the better and the best,
<br>
and the people who present them--like Semmelweiss in his time--are
<br>
uniformly ridiculed by 'the establishment'.  Perhaps I was outraged.
<br>
Rocketry, heavier-than-air flight, the light bulb, the germ theory of
<br>
disease,...the list is endless,...perhaps comprehensive,...every new idea
<br>
is ridiculed by the forces of orthodoxy.  Perhaps I was thinking that the
<br>
best defense is a good offense.  If ossified orthodoxy didn't have such a
<br>
perfect record re obstructionism, then I wouldn't get to throw Semmelwiess
<br>
at them.  Semmelweiss, despite great advances in alleviating human
<br>
suffering, was hounded out of his profession by the naysayers and
<br>
denigrators.  On behalf of Semmelweiss, and with history as my witness, I
<br>
unflinchingly indict the strutting, overly self-important, visionless
<br>
obstructionists of the present day.  J'accuse!  Cryonics, despite being
<br>
incomplete and unproven, is *already* successful in the sense that it is
<br>
implementable in a fashion which will 'do no harm', and could greatly
<br>
benefit humanity TODAY.  It deserves respect and a fair hearing.  Shame on
<br>
you. {;-) 
<br>
<p>The following four comments are of a kind, impugning my remarks as
<br>
'religious' in nature.  
<br>
<p>&quot;It's your religion. Substitute &quot;Jesus&quot; for 
<br>
&quot;cryonics&quot;, and I've heard it all before.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;You're banking on the limitless discoveries of the future, but you 
<br>
can't believe in the limitless possibilities of the past?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What if God is just some super-technical being who has existed long enough
<br>
to 
<br>
accomplish everything that religion has him accomplishing?&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;Why is one person's guess as to what may be possible any worse than 
<br>
yours? Why is one guess &quot;clearly unscientific&quot;, but your guess is 
<br>
&quot;scientific&quot;? Belief in Jesus and belief that cryonics will solve 
<br>
everything both take good-sized leaps of faith. When you make a big 
<br>
leap of faith, you leave the realm of science and anyone's guess is 
<br>
as good as anyone else's.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would simply reply that I make a distinction between 'faith' and
<br>
'confidence'.  The former is religious belief--absolute, and based on God
<br>
or superstition--the latter is conditional belief, based on scientific
<br>
rationalism.  I'll give you this though: I do get a warm glow from the
<br>
discovery--utterly unexpected-- that science gives me a 'real' shot at what
<br>
the clerical hucksters have been fraudulently peddling all these years.  So
<br>
I'll cop to it.  Science is my religion.  Though, among scientists, I am a
<br>
jesuit. 
<br>
<p>I feel lucky to have been raised 'outside' the other kind of religion.  It
<br>
has no power for me.  It's heritage is clearly superstition-based.  I
<br>
consider myself an agnostic, because an outright denial of God seems
<br>
unnecessarily forceful, and also presumptuous.  I'm quite comfortable with
<br>
&quot;I don't know.&quot;  Also, the conundrum of 'the uncaused cause' remains
<br>
unanswered.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Which brings us, finally, to the crux of the cryonics question. 
<br>
<p>Scientific materialism and rationalism have banished the mystical and
<br>
magical from the realm of biology.  Science unrelenting has penetrated the
<br>
ultra-microscopic realm and laid bare the machinery of the atom of
<br>
life--the cell.  'Life', no less wondrous and beautiful for it, becomes
<br>
fine-grained chemistry and physics,...and engineering.  Biological
<br>
nanomachines made us by the precise manipulation of matter at the
<br>
atomic/molecular scale--the existence proof.  And man-made nanomachines
<br>
will--almost to a certainty given enough time, and cryonics gives us that
<br>
time--be able to manipulate the fine-grained details of our material
<br>
selves--our material cells--with equally-precise, but now
<br>
purposefully-deliberate, atomic/molecular precision. 
<br>
<p>So we reach the final question.  To which you direct our attention with
<br>
these three comments:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;You have no clue as to what kind of damage is done to 
<br>
an organism after death and in the freezing process.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Once certain types of damage happen, all the future technology in the 
<br>
world won't help.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;...you don't *know* that it will bring about the result 
<br>
that you need - to restore people to some reasonable percentage of 
<br>
their previous state. How do we know that irreversible brain damage 
<br>
and memory loss don't happen within a few minutes of dying? How do 
<br>
we know that the very act of taking someone's body to such low 
<br>
temperatures doesn't *permanently* damage who he is?&quot; 
<br>
<p>Structural damage will be repairable.  Information damage--which is to say
<br>
information loss--is the crucial issue.  Will the processes to which you
<br>
refer above make the information which encodes memory and personality
<br>
unrecoverable?  I don't know.  In what details of neural structure are
<br>
these 'bits' encoded in the first place?  I don't know.  Is there some body
<br>
of information theory which informs us of the factors affecting information
<br>
durability?  I haven't found it and am not versed in it.  In an electron
<br>
micrograph of frozen-and-then-thawed tissue, where you can see structural
<br>
damage, can you see information damage?  Perhaps, if we knew what to look
<br>
for, but I don't.  Are they the same? (I don't think so.)  How then, do we
<br>
assess information damage?  I don't know.  Since many phenomena are
<br>
orderly, theoretically reversible, and can be mathematically modeled, are
<br>
the chemical and mechanical disruptions which the structure of
<br>
frozen-and-thawed tissue undergoes so insufficiently orderly that they
<br>
cannot be computationally back-modeled to infer the original structure?
<br>
Got me.
<br>
<p>These questions are just too complex for me to answer.  Too much that is
<br>
unknown, at least to me.  But I have a suspicion that the visual impact of
<br>
structural damage may provoke an unwarranted presumption of information
<br>
loss.  And I suspect that the current fears of information loss, are based
<br>
on just such unwarranted and uninformed presumption.  I prefer something
<br>
more fact-based.  I suspect that structure and information are not nearly
<br>
so correlated, and that information may be quite durable, and clearly
<br>
moreso when a thoughtful and deliberate effort is made to preserve it.
<br>
Consider the following illustration.  
<br>
<p>Take a delicate glass sculpture, place it in a leather sack, and flail it
<br>
repeatedly.  Then pour the shards into a bucket.  Structurally, the
<br>
sculpture is utterly destroyed, but because the broken surfaces of the
<br>
shards match perfectly, the information is perfectly preserved.  Whereas
<br>
glass lacks internal detail--it is homogenous and structurally amorphous
<br>
internally--biological 'materials' are characterized by a fine-grained,
<br>
massively-correlated internal matrix of linear and planar components.  And
<br>
a frozen body is not placed in a leather bag and shattered into
<br>
infinitesimal bits.  Rather I am reminded of something Robert Bradbury
<br>
wrote. If you put a chicken into the freezer and freeze it solid, then take
<br>
it out and defrost it, it does not liquify into a puddle of goo. (Not quite
<br>
the way Robert put it, but, like the chicken, it substantially retains its
<br>
form.) All the parts are there, and bear a strong resemblance to the original.
<br>
<p>In sum, given the accessibility of far-future technologies, the proven
<br>
preservation capabilty of LN2 storage, the orderliness, and theoretical and
<br>
computational reversibility of chemical and physical processes, (and
<br>
despite substantial uncertainty--accompanied by the obligitory
<br>
authoritarian and myopic declarations of 'Impossible!' and 'Fantasy!' and
<br>
'What if (insert bad thing here)!'--regarding the preservation of vital
<br>
memory- and personality-encoding information), and bearing in mind the
<br>
unblemished historical record of experts to grossly underestimate the
<br>
capabilities of future technology, and noting that all current science
<br>
stands in support of its feasibility (nothing in science prohibits it), I
<br>
confidently assert that the success of cryonics remains a near certainty,
<br>
and that time will bear this out.  What passes for evidence to the
<br>
contrary, for those who would assert the contrary, is but the feeble mantra
<br>
of envious prejudice: &quot;It's never been done.  It can't be done.  It's
<br>
impossible.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I rest my case.
<br>
<p>My suggestion to sue the medical profession was adjudged annoying, too bad,
<br>
troublesome, embarrassing, discomfiting, worrying, bothersome, bothering,
<br>
wearisome, irksome, tiresome, boring, tedious, burdensome, onerous,
<br>
oppressive, weighty, disappointing, unlucky, unfortunate, untoward,
<br>
adverse, awkward, unaccommodating, impossible, pesky, harassing, hassling,
<br>
hindering, importunate, pestering, plaguing, teasing, trying, irritating,
<br>
vexatious, aggravating, provoking, maddening, infuriating, galling,
<br>
stinging, biting, and/or mortifying.
<br>
<p>Therefore, in the spirit of good fellowship and social harmony, that
<br>
suggestion is withdrawn.
