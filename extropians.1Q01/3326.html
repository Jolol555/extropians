<p><em>&gt; Second, I agree with both of you that *a* right response is to work to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organize a counterweight to these voices - and I look forward to seeing all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of you at Extro5 this year :-)
</em><br>
<p>The same! BTW, is any date converging?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I've written here before, the luddite point of view has some real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages in the job of memetic competition.  The primary advantages I see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lie in the question of who does the talking and rule-making in our societies. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Regarding the former, for better or worse, the media IS overwhelmingly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staffed with people who lack technical or scientific education and experience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and whose attitudes are shaped by a culture inimical to values of progress.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a simple matter of the practicalities of career opportunities and personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talents, people tend to go into work in journalism from educational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backgrounds in the humanities.  And as a fact of history, academic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; departments in the humanities in the West have been overwhelmingly staffed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the 1960s by professors who hold attitudes antithetical to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Enlightenment values of reason and progress and who are deeply ignorant and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspicious of science, technology and enterprise.
</em><br>
<p>And the situation is even worse in Europe, since the journalists here
<br>
come to a greater extent from the lower middle class demographic
<br>
rather than the mid-upper demographic in the states. This has both
<br>
made them even less likely to have undergone extensive academic
<br>
training and even more likely to accept anti-progress leanings
<br>
eclectically directly from their surrounding culture. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rule-makers in the West also tend to come from similar educational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backgrounds, and then tend to rise to positions of power through personality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traits and long experience in behavior that has little need for knowledge or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of how science, technology and enterprise work.
</em><br>
<p>As Waldemar pointed out, spending time learning science, technology or
<br>
business is actually a bad investment if you want to become a good
<br>
politician (not necessary good for anybody else, but good at *being* a
<br>
politician) - you should spend the time learning the political culture
<br>
and networking, rather than learning politically useless knowledge.
<br>
<p>Another factor that comes up again and again in the debate here on the
<br>
list is that change is of course bad for the ones at the top in the
<br>
status quo, so they would be against it. However, I think this is a
<br>
relatively minor reason for the cultural bias. First, many of the
<br>
current elites rightly or wrongly perceive themselves as able to
<br>
handle a changing society, being the ones calling the shots even if
<br>
nanotechnology or life extension come about. They might be wrong about
<br>
this and likely underestimate the future changes, but I have not seen
<br>
a strong anti-progress bias because they fear going the way of the
<br>
dodo. Incidentally, one of the argument luddites make against new
<br>
technology is just that it would help the current elites to remain in
<br>
power - showing how complex the issue can be. 
<br>
<p>As Greg Egan put it in TAP:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;.... And a lot of people find that prospect threatening; it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turns a lot of old power structures on their head.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that cliche came true every time it was invoked, power
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structures would be oscillating faster than mains
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current.
<br>
<p>There are other groups more likely to perceive themselves threatened
<br>
by new technology, but I expect to find them in the lower middle class
<br>
or similar &quot;middle&quot; situations - they have a position to uphold, but
<br>
know they would be vulnerable to change and lack the necessary
<br>
education or optimism culture to think they would be able to benefit
<br>
from new developments. Hence they will be most likely to accept
<br>
luddite memes. Notice which social group many european journalists
<br>
come from.
<br>
<p>I think this kind of analysis, crude as it may be, is an useful first
<br>
start to see where we can influence things. For example, the academic
<br>
world and intellecturals in general are clearly very important for
<br>
their meme filtering and spreading effect, so making origressive and
<br>
extropian ideas acceptable to them would be a major step forward. It
<br>
might be less important to teach politicians science, and more
<br>
relevant to show them that there are votes in the pro-progress side
<br>
and real practical success stories based on enlightenment methods to
<br>
be exploited. And so on.
