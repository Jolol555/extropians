</em><br>
<p>I've been following the discussion since end-December 2000, and it is indeed
<br>
not breakable, since built-in at the hardware level. You can't read the
<br>
(large, many) CPRM keys of a hard drive (stored in a dedicated surface
<br>
area) by means other than opening it in a clean room, and bypassing the 
<br>
controller.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  - That the masses will be indifferent enough not to mind if they buy a hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disk and there's this weird &quot;CPRM&quot; thing mentioned in the fine print.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but there are 5-10% of consumers which are going to care. And they
<br>
constitute a market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suddenly, there will be *no* alternatives. And while we were looking away,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scenery for content extortion has been set up.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From lurking on t13 mailing list I have the impression that C4 entity people
</em><br>
were really surprised by the public outrage, and backed off quickly. We'll see
<br>
how it goes. In any case, I'm not going to buy any CPRM device, period. If this
<br>
means I can't buy any device at all, tough luck.

<em>&gt; There is this film called The Matrix, I'm sure some of you might have heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it [grin]. There's this Keanu Reeves that plays some bloke named Neo in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this film, and Keanu gets USD 30 million to do it. But that might still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK; I don't mind that.
</em><br>
<p>The man wants to make copying hard. Losses are negligable if 99.9% of all
<br>
users can't bypass the copyright protection.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Oh, but I forgot. There is also this producer who earns hundreds of millions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the movie. Oh, and they produce hundreds of movies to earn hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions from. But I could tolerate that, too.
</em><br>
<p>Movies will be getting ripped off, whether copyright protected, or not.
<br>
A person still needs to be able to see it, so you can intercept the content
<br>
there. For instance, I can grab the frame buffer, or just set up a digital
<br>
camera and film stuff of a CRT or LCD.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What I *don't* particularly like is that these people don't realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are already in an outrageously advantegous position, and now they even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to *increase* their advantage. If this succeeds, I think it may lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a totalitarian regime (diguised as a democracy) with content-generators as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the new powers that be.
</em><br>
<p>I dunno, I can rip off DVDs and CDs just fine. I just don't bother.
<br>
If they're going to up the ante, we're going to get a rather large alternative
<br>
low-commercial culture.  If I make a movie or a music piece, I own the rights 
<br>
to it, and can publish it on the Net as it will darn please me, do PR by word 
<br>
of mouth or hire a PR agency, and take whatever revenue might be coming in.
