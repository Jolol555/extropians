<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Legislating a total ban without compensation on something that most

<em>&gt;  &gt; policy.  This isn't even about guns; it is flawed in principle applied to

<em>&gt;  &gt; any material item with a similar profile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firstly, I concede that what I teased you with is probably unworkable in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society like the USA. But it's not stupid; it's just unworkable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beyond that, your argument is a bit funny in its own right. You say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;everyone has firearms&quot;. So if there was a buyback, the government should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay for these firearms. But who pays the government to do it? The people do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously. The same people who have guns would pay themselves the price to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let go of the guns. :-) On a larger scale, this scheme is economically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to just taking the guns away at no compensation.
</em><br>
<p>Not quite. Making the citizens who are willfully not armed pay those who
<br>
are to disarm is a quite acceptable libertarian solution, since fair
<br>
economics demands that externalities be paid by those introducing them
<br>
into the economy. If those who are wilfully unfree want those who are
<br>
not to give up their unfree status, they must PAY for it, assuming those
<br>
who are free are willing to sell their freedom. Make no mistake: so long
<br>
as there is government and police forces, an unarmed person is not free,
<br>
they are merely tolerated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You see, the problem your society seems to have is that you are in love with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firearms, 100 years after there shouldn't be any rational use for them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anymore. At the time your founding fathers set up the constitution, America
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a cowboy land. Sure, you definitely needed a shotgun at that time, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of them as possible. But that time has passed, has it? You now have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun-wielding cowboys passing through New York and San Francisco, and I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's just a little bit misplaced.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I don't know. If it were not for firearms, I'd imagine a lot more
<br>
than just 6-12 million people would have been gassed and incinerated a
<br>
half century ago (a large chunk of which would have been your
<br>
countrymen).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One day when you get around to it you might want to rethink that part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your constitution. [As well as the electoral college part, I might add.]
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. The electoral college is one of the important safety
<br>
valves that protects us against the mobocracy and demagoguery that
<br>
caused the doom of Athens and Rome. I even think that we should rescind
<br>
the newer amendment that eliminated the Governor controlled appointment
<br>
of Senators. The difference between our society and yours is the same
<br>
difference between Sparta and Athens: both have flaws, we just don't
<br>
structure our society to lower itself to the lowest common denominator
<br>
(yet), as Parliamentary systems like yours (and most all of europe) do.
<br>
They are little but popularly elected dictatorships, petty
<br>
fasco-socialist governments with good PR.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No offense intended - it's just that a society's rules need to develop along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the society. Although a conservative pace of development is usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial as far as the law is concerned, you seem to be stuck in a hole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with no way out: Johnny grow up with guns, Johnny emotionally attached to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guns.
</em><br>
<p>This is standard fascist claptrap. So if you thought that if society had
<br>
evolved beyond the need to have free speech (when such speech is
<br>
obviously a danger to an 'evolved' society), religion (when such are
<br>
obviously wrong), assembly (who needs to assemble when we can all
<br>
communcate via the web?), against search and seizure (if you are an
<br>
honest person, what do you need to hide? If everything we do for society
<br>
is to its glory and not our own, then 'seizure' is a meaningless
<br>
concept), against self incrimination (if you didn't break a law, you
<br>
must not have anything incriminating to say, right?), then its obvious
<br>
that the whole idea of freedom is obsolete, according to you, and we
<br>
should all just jump into our pods and join the proto-matrix of fascist
<br>
/ socialist propaganda and control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, I may be wrong. Maybe guns are good. But I sure don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in a neighbourhood where every lunatic has one; I prefer a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbourhood where the most they can do is punch you in the face.
</em><br>
<p>I want to live in a neighborhood where people are so polite and
<br>
respectful of others that there is never a need to punch someone else in
<br>
the face. My gun toting community is that (the only fight I have ever
<br>
been in outside of combat was in a city that had gun control).
<br>
<em>&gt;From the stats I've cited, its pretty plain that the crime problem inthe
</em><br>
US is with those segments of society that distribute and use drugs
<br>
(legal and illegal) to a very high degree, and who are also highly
<br>
dependent upon welfare programs. This behavior indicates a large degree
<br>
of individual irresponsibility. One reason I'm not terribly opposed to
<br>
drug laws is that drugs are a tool by which an individual can give up
<br>
their self control, avoid their responsibility. Individuals who turn to
<br>
drugs tend to suffer from incidents in life that stripped them of their
<br>
confidence in their ability to be responsible, whether real incidents
<br>
like death, accidents, sickness, or artificially induced things like
<br>
propaganda, discrimination, prejudice from others. This denigration of
<br>
the individual sense of self, and trust in the individual by others is a
<br>
vicious cycle that destroys the institutions of a truly free and open
<br>
society. It is a practice well known and taught in ChiCom and other
<br>
marxist / leftist revolutionary methodologies: destroy trust in the
<br>
individual, institute government controls to restrain individual
<br>
freedoms, create oppression, generate widespread real or perceived
<br>
disaffection, then start the revolution. None of this can work until you
<br>
disarm the individual who is most likely to oppose the revolution.
