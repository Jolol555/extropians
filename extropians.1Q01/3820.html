University Of Washington Physicists Find That Extra Dimensions Must Be SmallerThan 0.2 Millimeter 
<br>
University of Washington scientists using gravity measurements to hunt for evidence of dimensions in addition to those already known have found that
<br>
those dimensions would have to occupy a space smaller than 0.2 millimeter. In making that finding, the team headed by UW physics professors Eric Adelberger
<br>
and Blayne Heckel gained new insights into gravity. One of the biggest mysteries in physics is why gravity is so weak compared with all other natural forces.
<br>
Asmall magnet suspended above a table, for instance, can easily overcome the
<br>
downward gravitational pull of the entire Earth and pick up a nail. 
<br>
One idea, string theory, involves &quot;extra&quot; dimensions. It requires that there be 10 space dimensions, and it usually assumes that seven of those dimensions
<br>
arecurled up in regions so tiny they cannot be detected by current technology. A new development in that theory suggests that gravity's apparent weakness
<br>
could be caused by a unique property allowing gravity to leak off into &quot;extra&quot;
<br>
dimensions, while everything else is confined to the normal dimensions of length, width and height. Extra dimensions would be a millimeter in size or
<br>
smaller and, until now, no experiment could have detected them. The Adelberger-Heckel team looked for anomalies at small distances that might
<br>
signal the presence of extra dimensions. 
<br>
&quot;Gravity is the only way to see these extra dimensions but the very weakness of gravity has meant that there was no way to test the theory,&quot; said Adelberger.
<br>
&quot;No one had even been able to detect the gravitational attraction between two millimeter-sized objects, much less see if the force could be stronger than
<br>
expected.&quot; 
<br>
The UW team recently measured the strength of gravity at a distance of just 0.2 millimeter and found no deviation from the gravitational pull predicted by
<br>
theinverse-square law devised by Isaac Newton. &quot;No one had ever detected that gravity even existed at distances less than a millimeter,&quot; said Heckel. 
<br>
&quot;We find that if the extra dimensions exist, they have to be smaller than two-tenths of a millimeter,&quot; Adelberger said. &quot;This doesn't say the extra
<br>
dimensions idea is crazy. It's just not as easy as the simplest picture.&quot; 
<br>
The research team already is fabricating equipment to test to 0.1 millimeter or less, and has begun planning an experiment to test at even smaller distances.
<br>
The findings, to be published in the Feb. 19 edition of Physical Review Letters, are based on results using a ring suspended just above a rotating disk. The
<br>
ring contains 10 small holes and hangs by a tungsten fiber just 20 microns (less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick. The rotating disk, with 10 similar holes,
<br>
exerts gravitational pull on the pendulum, twisting it back and forth 10 timesfor every revolution of the plate. The amount of twist is measured by shining a
<br>
laser beam off a mirror mounted on the ring. 
<br>
The device, housed in the UW's Nuclear Physics Laboratory, has its main parts coated with gold, and a gold-coated copper foil less than one-thousandth of
<br>
aninch is stretched between the ring and the disk. Those precautions are designed to prevent electrical forces from interfering with the gravitational tug
<br>
being measured. The Adelberger-Heckel team will continue trying to measure at smaller
<br>
distances to explore whether some gravitational force might be spilling over from other very tiny dimensions. 
<br>
&quot;We don't know if these ideas are right, but they are revolutionary,&quot;  Adelberger said. &quot;There would be profound consequences if the ideas are correct.&quot;
