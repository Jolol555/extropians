<p>I couldn't find any concerns regarding human cloning on the Wired email
<br>
list, but I found:
<br>
&quot;'The scientists are trying to play God!'
<br>

<br>
That is the knee-jerk reaction to almost any biomedical breakthrough:
<br>
cloning, tissue regeneration, cures for lethal diseases, immortality. When
<br>
a sheep named Dolly was produced by cloning, a world-wide cry of fear and
<br>
revulsion rose from politicians, religious leaders, and media pundits.
<br>
The president of France, Jacques Chirac, called cloning 'a degrading
<br>
attack on humanity' and suggested a ban on such research throughout the
<br>
industrialized world. Pope John Paul II also inveighed against human
<br>
cloning, fearing that scientists will attempt to 'play God.'...
<br>
When Pope John Paul II invoked the 'playing God' cliché, His Holiness
<br>
overlooked the fact that the medical attention that has more than once
<br>
saved his own life is surely 'playing God.' Otherwise he would be among
<br>
the angels now. Every time we take an aspirin or an antibiotic we are
<br>
'playing God.' What else is the coronary bypass procedure that saves a
<br>
heart attack victim from imminent death?&quot;
<br>
-------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I really can't figure out what it is about the prospect of human cloning
<br>
that triggers hysteria in some people. Does it threaten their belief
<br>
systems? Their ideas of the human soul? One woman I know went ballistic at
<br>
the mere mention of actually cloning a human. This I find interesting
<br>
because she's been involved in social engineering via primary education
<br>
for decades. So, what's the big deal with crossing over to
<br>
bio-engineering?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
