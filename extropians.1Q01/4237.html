<p>I didn't say any of those things. I was quoting someone else who said
<br>
someone else said them.
<br>
<p>But finally I did say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It will come from a blend of the genome program data, fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; computational protein folding, and nanotechnology.  Neither of the latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are receiving as much funding right now as routine cardiac surgery, say
</em><br>
<p>Ben retorts:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would argue that there is tons of work being done in the area of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;computational protein folding&quot;.  It really is a hot field right now. 
</em><br>
<p>And there's more money now invested in that field than in routine cardiac
<br>
surgery? (You might be right; I ask in my ignorance.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;your listing of these three keys is strange to me.  I understand it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone saying that &quot;we need to learn the alphabet!  You know, the vowels
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the letters B and M.&quot;  What you list is surely important to the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but do not really cover much of the actual problem space 
</em><br>
<p>Of course not. That's not what I was saying. You go on to enumerate various
<br>
health issues and specific approaches to solving them, most of which I
<br>
agree with (except that nanomedicine will solve some of those problems
<br>
sideways. if Robert Freitas is right). But I was discussing the topic of
<br>
major life extension at a coarser grain than that. It's as if I said in the
<br>
1930s: `To get into space, we'll need a lot of money spent on rocket
<br>
design, telecommunications and fuel development', and someone retorted: `Oh
<br>
come on, you've left out the design of portholes, the kinds of soles
<br>
they'll need on their spacesuits, and special brushes for sweeping up all
<br>
the coal'.
