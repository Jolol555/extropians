<p>Both wrong. Being intense heat sources, both generate immense updraft.
<br>
You'll nail the bulk of the critters, spreading the rest all over the place.
<br>
Um, and why should these be localized infestations? Because they attempt 
<br>
to be particularly nice? If anything, you can assume that whatever you're 
<br>
getting will be multifocal.
<br>
<p>Not a good idea.
<br>
<p>As to shields, look from Earth from space. It's rather green in places.
<br>
Are all of the plants going to get shields, too? One for every leaf?
<br>
And what are you going to power these with?
