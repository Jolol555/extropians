<p>
Yeah. Obviously Drexler at least was thinking about
<br>
such things very early--as witness his &quot;active
<br>
shields&quot; riff. (Do NOT get me started on THAT one...)
<br>
<p>Re: date--'tis why I said apparently and mentioned
<br>
c-date.
<br>
<p>Re: Terminology criticism--am working on a critique of
<br>
considerably more &quot;depth&quot; than the above.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;)
<br>
<p>Publication? Funny you should mention that; I'm a
<br>
journalist. (published in Omni, Parade, etc. Once
<br>
interviewed Crick on neural nets and human vision, but
<br>
the mag--Omni--went under before printing it.)
<br>
<p>As should be obvious from previous posts, nuclear
<br>
physics is not my strongest area.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;:)
<br>
<p>Q: Just what forum would you recommend for a response
<br>
to something with a title like this thing, anyway..? I
<br>
gotta tell you, Freitas' nanomedicine is
<br>
impressive--but this paper is full of holes. Practical
<br>
holes, not scientific.

<em>&gt; &gt; Yah. I find it interesting that the thing

<em>&gt; Some people take

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My guess is that Mr. Joy's media attention certainly

<em>&gt; OK, so you don't like Freitas having a penchant for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neologisms. Hardly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental flaw in the work, it seems to me. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; title was already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The issue of what countermeasures would work after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice of the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is definitely worth further exploration. Why don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you work up something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for publication?
