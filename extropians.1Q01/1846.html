<em>&gt; Hello,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about a rocket that you can carry around and set on the ground,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where it will then launch itself into space.  Here I am talking about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rocket that weighs less than fifty pounds.  It would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-contained levelling stand so it could point in the good direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to achieve orbit.  I am thinking it would have a propellant or ion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhaust.  If it was fusion powered, it could escape the plasma into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch vesicle, and power itself from the via ramscoop once it hit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; velocity.  You would have to stand fifty or a hundred meters away.
</em><br>
<p>Alternate approach: give it wings sufficient to take off from a
<br>
commercial airport.  Much easier integration into existing aerospace
<br>
infrastructure that way, even if the wings aren't that useful once in
<br>
orbit.  Even non-fusion-powered plasma might be doable to achieve
<br>
orbit, since you'd only have to supply a few minutes of power from
<br>
batteries or capacitors.
<br>
<p>The challenge here would be making the engine light but powerful enough
<br>
to deliver &gt; 1 G of thrust.  Existing similar engines are designed for,
<br>
at most, .05 G, though that's mainly because they're envisioned only
<br>
for use after launch, for hours or days of constant thrust, with an
<br>
onboard power plant which would be inordinately heavy if providing
<br>
power for 1 G.  I suspect one could get some useful economies of scale
<br>
as the engine gets more powerful; at worst, though, if one engine gives
<br>
X newtons of thrust above what it needs to thrust itself (including
<br>
power source, reaction mass, and structure to hold the engine) at 1 G
<br>
(or whatever launch acceleration is desired) for the launch period
<br>
(that is, however long it takes to achieve orbital velocity), and one
<br>
needs Y newtons of thrust to give the same acceleration over the same
<br>
period to the rest of the rocket, then one simply needs to mount Y/X
<br>
engines.
<br>
<p>If this launcher could recharge in orbit (electricity via solar
<br>
panels, and reaction mass via ramscoop - though this latter one might
<br>
be too slow for practical use), it could launch with just enough power
<br>
to get to orbit plus maneuvering, then at the end of its mission,
<br>
reverse thrust and drop to near 0 velocity relative to Earth, dropping
<br>
back into the atmosphere without resorting to aerobraking (and thus,
<br>
without needing the thermal protection that aerobraking to remove
<br>
orbital velocity requires) except to bleed off the last few hundred
<br>
kmph once it gets to its landing area (just like airplanes do).  Then
<br>
again, it might be better just to launch it with enough charge and
<br>
reaction mass to get to orbit and return, thus allowing mission abort
<br>
at any time (better known as &quot;safety margin&quot;).
