&quot;Evolution is a fact, because it is inferred by scientific observations, 
<br>
explained by scientific theories and anyone who disputes this is wrong (or 
<br>
stupid, or anti-science, or uneducated, or a religious nut, etc.).&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Karl R. Popper, as a philosopher of science, wrote that this 
<br>
kind of optimistic statement along with the self-confidence and 
<br>
impossibility about being wrong leads to self-deception and does nothing to 
<br>
guard against errors.  The Australian writer and philosopher, Rafe 
<br>
Champion said, in the Australian journal _The Skeptic_, in 1991, 
<br>
that George Orwell described this as applied by Catholics and Communists: 
<br>
&quot;Each of them tacitly claims that 'the truth' has already been revealed, and 
<br>
that the heretic if he is not simply a fool, is secretly aware of 'the truth' 
<br>
and merely resists it out of selfish motives.&quot;  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>The importance of this subject to the Extropian, is dubious, and 
<br>
is mostly a clash of _True Believers_. Yet, does, at least illustrate how 
<br>
easily the _dogma_ meme complex infects even the most thoughtful of 
<br>
humanity.  Both making such statements are True Believers, whether 
<br>
scientist or religionist.  Both have the _same_ dogmatic authoritarian 
<br>
cult attitude.  _Their_ source of knowledge is 
<br>
correct.  The truth of their assertion is obvious and easily seen 
<br>
by all who use the correct means (_their_ means) of acquiring 
<br>
true enlightenment.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>To me, as a scientist, evolution really being &quot;out there&quot; is _not_ obvious, 
<br>
nor does it make common sense.  However, most scientists *and* most 
<br>
_religionists_ (both) believe evolution takes place.  The reason(s) both 
<br>
believe are different, called: explanatory theories.  Now, _both_ 
<br>
find great plausibility for their own respective theories, one supernatural and 
<br>
one natural.  Science (science not infected with dogmatism that 
<br>
is) can _test_ its own (possibly inductively generated) theory 
<br>
via observations and prediction of physical reality, via deductive 
<br>
reasoning.  Science can not test non-physical supernatural theories -- no 
<br>
observations or predictions to test.  Not even the religionists can 
<br>
test non-physical supernatural theories. They take it on faith 
<br>
or make endless qualifications until the theory fits the dogma 
<br>
e.g., &quot;There must be a God that created everything, it's just that . . . 
<br>
maybe . . .  he is invisible.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Now, I ask you:  Which theory is more likely to be disproved, if 
<br>
wrong?  If you never totally accept it as fact, which theory is 
<br>
guarded against errors?  Conversely:  If you accept a certain theory 
<br>
_as fact_, just what would have to happen to withdraw that acceptance?  If 
<br>
you stop testing and questioning your assertion what becomes of your 
<br>
assertion?  See: Flew, Antony. _Theology and Falsification_. _Philosophy 
<br>
Now_ Oct/Nov 2000 page 28-9.
