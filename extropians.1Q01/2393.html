</em><br>
<p>For the sake of an argument about &quot;natural rights&quot; based on human nature
<br>
not being an absurdity, there is no onus on me to say anything about the
<br>
rights of non-humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And why are you insisting on judging other people by some objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criterion? Can't you just admit that your own views of their behaviour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are subjective, and don't have any intrinsic merit or demerit?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If it is all utterly subjective then disapproving of even a society
<br>
committing the worse atrocities becomes utterly subjective.  On a more
<br>
personal level my opinion that person X should not kill me just because
<br>
they wish to has no justice claims at all and is merely and only my
<br>
preference.  Would you agree with such notions?  If not then why not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, you haven't given a better paradigm yet nor has anyone else which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is part of why the world is awash in a sea of cultural relativism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You appear hostile to cultural relativism -- which, as far as I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned, is a vitally important viewpoint that needs to be nurtured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cherished. (It's the best way of distinguishing fanatics from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who you can negotiate with: the presence of relativism is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicator of flexibility.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Really?  So you believe the opinions of primitive witch doctors on the
<br>
causes and cures of diseases say are every bit as good as the latest
<br>
from scientific medicine?  So it doesn't matter to you at all in
<br>
practice which is used to treat you if you fall ill?  What do you mean
<br>
by &quot;nourished and cherished&quot;?  If it means that you can't judge one as
<br>
more valid than the other in any aspects at all without being
<br>
un-nourishing then I have a problem.  Flexibility in matters of what
<br>
does and doesn't work or is and isn't true is not always desirable. 
<br>
Such flexibility would lead to teaching creation science as being just
<br>
as valid as evolution in our schools.  Would you consider that a good
<br>
thing?  If not, why not and and on what basis?
<br>
<p>My opposition to relativism (or not) depends hugely on what is and is
<br>
not meant by that term in real situations.
