Excercise: Visit an American mall, stroll around a few stores staffed 
<br>
by several people of different sexes. Notice who's doing the work, 
<br>
who's helping the customers, and who's jabbering about the Superbowl. 
<br>
Women are in general more conscientious on the job--except when a 
<br>
gorgeous babe (or what passes for one these days) shows up, in which 
<br>
case the guys trample each other to &quot;assist&quot; her.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;working than people in the US and most of the work is pretty tiring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and definitely not what you'd call fun or uplifting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't completely trust people who live in a country to give you an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective opinion.  I spent several months working in India about 6 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years back, and I have a completely opposite opinion of the work 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During my time in Hyderabad (large city toward the center of India), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had a chance to observe a number of different classes of people in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their day-to-day lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My fellow Americans and I were absolutely astounded at the milling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around going on.  You'd see large groups of the same men standing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around for hours during the day.  At first, I thought the men 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing outside my window on the side of the road were waiting for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bus or something, but soon, it became apparent that these guys were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just hanging out shooting the breeze.  This was day after day, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere we went.  I'm not talking about one or two guys hanging 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out on an isolated corner, I'm talking about clumps of dozens all up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and down the roads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The engineers in our office were better, although I was a bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised at the lack of drive and enthusiasm.  We were a successful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American startup with Indian ownership, so we had good funding and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots of &quot;connections&quot; to locals who could find good people, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment, etc.  We had lots of modern workstations, tons of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documentation, a good Internet connection, and we let our engineers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that we were more than willing to allow them after-hours and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weekend use of the computers for their own projects.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universities that these guys attended had old crappy computers that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could only get access to for a couple of hours a week.  We were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offering them a technological playground, and making ourselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to teach them anything they wanted to learn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They couldn't have cared less.  For the most part, they came in, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked their hours, then went home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only time we noticed any kind of dedication to work was with the women.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While the men were milling around talking, you'd see women going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about their duties - usually labor-intensive work, like sweeping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dirty streets with small straw brooms or scrubbing floors with rags. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whenever a woman wasn't actually working, you could see that she was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going somewhere.  You rarely saw a group of women just standing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around flapping their gums.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My boss (who spent two years there) was at a construction site, where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were laying some bricks on the fourth floor.  The people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carrying the bricks up the stairs were women - they had them stacked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon their heads.  Up where the bricks were being laid were about 5 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times as many men as were needed to do the job, so the ones not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually laying the bricks were just standing around talking.  My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boss said, &quot;Why are the women carrying all these bricks and the men 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are laying them or just standing around?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The response was, &quot;Well, laying the bricks is 'skilled' labor.&quot;  It's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really hard to keep a straight face in that country.  The real reason 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was that they have a comfortable little male-dominated society, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they weren't interested in rocking their lazy-ass boat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could spend days detailing my experiences there and those of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coworkers, but suffice it to say that India's problems aren't some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big magical mystery.  They're not just the fault of their government 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or their large population or the evil Western World.  It's a failure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the individuals of their society who embrace a culture of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance, corruption, and getting the &quot;other guy&quot; to do their work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them.
