<em>&gt; &gt; Is this Rosetta, as in Rosetta Inpharmatics, Inc(RSTA) of Seattle? This

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rosetta+CASP&hl=en&lr=&safe=off">http://www.google.com/search?q=rosetta+CASP&hl=en&lr=&safe=off</a>
</em><br>
<p>Thanks!
<br>
<p>And Hood's Rosetta(RSTA) is referencing the Rosetta stone of Egypt:
<br>
<p>[According to Hood, &quot;Biology is an information system.and biotechnology is
<br>
decodifying scientific information.&quot; The heritage of the human genome
<br>
project will be a &quot;periodic table of life, the global tools of genomics and
<br>
proteomics and paradigm changes leading to systems biology,&quot; Hood said. And
<br>
that's the challenge for the 21st century -- to understand complex
<br>
biological systems and networks, like the brain. &quot;We will take complicated
<br>
systems and divide them into subsystems. Then we'll define the elements of
<br>
the subsystems, perturb the subsystems to analyze the information flow and
<br>
create mathematical models of systems behavior,&quot; Hood explained. Here's
<br>
where model organisms -- bacteria, yeast, Drosophila, nematodes and mice --
<br>
come into their own, Hood explained, for they are indeed &quot;the Rosetta stone
<br>
to decipher human genetic complexity.&quot; In the end, &quot;the systems approach to
<br>
disease will lead to a revolution in medicine.&quot;]
<br>
<p>However, I still wonder if RSTA employs Rosetta(IT) in its drug-targeting
<br>
pathways.
<br>
<p>After Hood disassembles a human to its functional parts, it will be
<br>
interesting to see what results when he puts the pieces back together.
<br>
Hopefully, if he tinkered with cars as a teen, he could get them
<br>
up-and-running again without too many leftover parts :-))
