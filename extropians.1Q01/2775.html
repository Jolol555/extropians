<em>&gt; The main reason I can think of for not having a government-provided

</em><br>
<em>&gt;   one group of people calling themselves &quot;the government&quot; to steal from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another group of people, regardless of how the thieves dispose of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stolen goods. A guaranteed income would seem to require that this sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theft be perpetrated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Which of course depends on what the notions of ownership are and are
<br>
not.  If the plenty produced by say NT is not considered to be owned by
<br>
a relative handful of individuals then it is not theft to distribute it
<br>
to all.  Who owns the assemblers?  When assemblers make other assemblers
<br>
who owns them? Ad infinitum.

<p><em>&gt; [Damien writes: &quot;...society will pay everyone, as an inalienable right, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic minimum dividend drawn from the productivity and wealth of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation.&quot;--the problem with this is that society is made up of individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Productivity and wealth don't appear unattached to human effort. In order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;draw&quot; them and make them available for distribution, one must first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take them from the individuals who produced them--this is the libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument, and it's valid, I think, to the extent that current distribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of wealth reflects a morally justifiable process]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>With assemblers wealth in the form of material goods will be effectively
<br>
as infinitely divisable and free from further human effort as digital
<br>
bits largely are today.  The above argument is scarcity based and does
<br>
not account for new and coming conditions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   In Chapter 7 of THE SPIKE Damien mentions, in passing, the concept of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteed income as an inheritance. [&quot;...let's not look at a guaranteed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; income as a 'natural right,' like the supposed innate rights to freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech and liberty. Rather it is an inheritance, something *owed* to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the children of a society whose ancestors for generations have together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built, and purchased through the work of their minds and hands, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resource base sustaining today's cornucopia.&quot;]  I like this idea a lot, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it ties into the discussion we were recently having about &quot;human nature.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I partially like it and partiall do not as it can be used to justify
<br>
real theivery past and present.  The reason everyone gets the basics in
<br>
the NT future is because producing the basics for everyone is not a
<br>
burden at all on anyone, not because everyone has a claim on everyone
<br>
else simply by virtue of being born.
<br>
<p>Now I could see an argument that an advanced society would consider its
<br>
true wealth to be directly proportional to all of its citizens being in
<br>
maximal shape as far as actualizing their potential (assuming their
<br>
potential is good or neutral for a moment).  This is more or less the
<br>
STNG position.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But our present system isn't working very well either. Not for the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of people living within it. Most people spend the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their time doing things they don't want to be doing. For most people, life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be said to be joyful. One reason for this seems to be the
</em><br>
<p>Actually we have far more discretionary time on average than at any
<br>
other time and more discretionary income.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; association of having a job with being a respectable person. The problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this is that a huge portion of the &quot;work&quot; done each day is bullshit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;busy work.&quot;  An example of busy work in school: my daughter and I used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend a certain part of each year traveling, and I'd get the lesson plans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the teachers so she could keep up with her class at school. We'd
</em><br>
<p>I agree that a lot of work is &quot;busy work&quot; seeming designed simply to
<br>
ensure more people are 
<br>
&quot;respectable&quot; and have the means to be consumers in order to create and
<br>
sustain more &quot;respectable&quot; jobs.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another quote from THE SPIKE: &quot;In a world mutating ever more swiftly under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the impact of high technology, detestable toil will be very hard to find,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even invent.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd never heard of Robert Theobald until I read THE SPIKE and was overjoyed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discover his work. At the link below you can read, in book form, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series of lectures he prepared shortly before his death in 1999.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theobald says:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;My experience shows that people ready for new opportunities. Think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how avalanches start. When conditions are ripe, the immediate cause can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very minor. The same is true for cultural shifts. The real challenge today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is learn how to act as though what we do can make a difference. As the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropologist Margaret Mead said: 'Never doubt that a small group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed people can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever has'.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.transform.org/transform/tlc/rschap1a.html">http://www.transform.org/transform/tlc/rschap1a.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to begin a discussion here and now about changing the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures of the world. Rather than falling into the abyss of pigeon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holing and name calling, I'd like to begin by looking for common ground.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What sort of lives do we want to live? If we were writing the scripts for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own lives, including he sort of society we'll live in, what would we write?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hear, Hear!  Yes!  I hope we will leave room in our society for its
<br>
dissenters also.  Creating a coherent vision of what we want is an
<br>
absolutely essential step in arriving in a future you actually want to
<br>
inhabit.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Here's a quote from one of Theobald's lectures:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;A new image may help us to grasp the ways we shall need to behave in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future. Herman Daly, an economist who challenges the growth ethic, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested that our present economic system is like a jet plane that must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fly at high speed, because otherwise it will stall and crash. He suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we should start to think about a helicopter which could hover.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, a helicopter is both fuel-inefficient and noisy. I propose that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start thinking about a glider as our symbol for the future. I recognize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger of pushing any analogy too far but there are some fascinating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts which emerge as one considers the operation of a glider.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yukky analogy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;First, any activity will inevitably use up resources at its beginning. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate questions are first, what is the minimum effective amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources needed to accomplish the purpose, and second, whether the gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will compensate for the expenditure of energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, just as an experienced pilot can find a thermal when the less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skilled may miss it, an individual who knows how to carry through an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity has a far greater chance of succeeding than the uninformed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>And who should make these decisions but the local persons/entities
<br>
involved?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Third, the glider is brilliantly designed for its purpose. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-industrial world will not have the resources to tolerate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overdesign and waste which is so common today. Overcoming problems by brute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force, rather than by using imagination and knowledge, will not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, the amount of resources is drastically increasing. 
<br>
Brute force is quite acceptable when it is more efficient than the
<br>
intellectual and computational resources necessary to calculate a more
<br>
optimal solution.
