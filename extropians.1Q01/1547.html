<p><p>Experimental versions have been made. The biggest problem is that energy 
<br>
density goes up with the square of the rotational speed - to get the really 
<br>
great storage numbers you need million RPM units and above. This requires 
<br>
exotic materials for the flywheel rim. (Also, a pretty hard vacuum to spin in!)
<br>
<p>Remember to put all the rotating mass (or as much as possible) at the rim...
<br>
<p>Magnetic suspension bearings are 'de rigeur'. The best way to couple energy 
<br>
in and out is to use three - phase induction motor / generator techniques. 
<br>
This requires a variable speed driver / inverter system that outputs 
<br>
regular house current.
<br>
<p>One experimental power storage version I read about was designed so if the 
<br>
filament-wound rotor should fail, it would expand relatively slowly in the 
<br>
radial direction and spend its' energy in friction against the housing. 
<br>
It's still not pleasant to be near, but at least there's no shrapnel.
<br>
<p>My &quot;dream home&quot; design has a low-speed flywheel (~7200 RPM)  driven by a 
<br>
three-phase motor off the power lines - not much energy is used to keep it 
<br>
spinning - that in turn drives a synchronous generator. Almost perfect 
<br>
isolation for brown-outs and dropouts in the main supply line, and in case 
<br>
of a blackout, a Diesel generator has ample time to start and speed up 
<br>
before the flywheel slows too much...
<br>
<p>All this brings to mind a non-chemical &quot;grenade&quot; described by Dean Ing: a 
<br>
miniature flywheel running at some incredible speed - it has a sawtooth 
<br>
pattern on it's rim. Encase it in a frangible vacuum housing with a 
<br>
mirror-image sawtooth on the inside. The rotor axis is held rigid in the 
<br>
&quot;unarmed&quot; state.
<br>
<p>Once it's emplaced, the rotor axis is released - it's retained by magnetic 
<br>
bearings in the center as long as no one moves the housing. If the thing IS 
<br>
moved, precession causes the rotor and housing to come into rather violent 
<br>
contact...
