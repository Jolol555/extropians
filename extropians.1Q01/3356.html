<p>New Brookhaven Lab Study Shows How Ritalin Works
<br>
<p>UPTON, NY - New research on Ritalin, a drug prescribed to millions of 
<br>
American children each year with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
<br>
Disorder (ADHD), shows for the first time how the drug acts in the 
<br>
human brain and why it is so effective.
<br>
<p>The findings are reported in the January 15 issue of the Journal of 
<br>
Neuroscience by researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy's 
<br>
Brookhaven National Laboratory. The publication can be found on the 
<br>
Web at 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/20014896">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/20014896</a>
<br>
<p>Although Ritalin has been used for more than 40 years as a successful 
<br>
treatment for ADHD, minimal information has been gathered to date on 
<br>
exactly how the drug works in the brain, outside of limited animal 
<br>
studies. This latest study, on humans, indicates that Ritalin 
<br>
significantly increases levels of dopamine in the brain, thereby 
<br>
stimulating attention and motivational circuits that enhance one's 
<br>
ability to focus and complete tasks.
<br>
<p>&quot;For the first time, we are seeing that Ritalin given at doses 
<br>
commonly used to treat children with ADHD significantly increases 
<br>
levels of dopamine in the brain,&quot; said psychiatrist Nora Volkow, head 
<br>
of the research team and Associate Laboratory Director for Life 
<br>
Sciences at Brookhaven Lab. &quot;This combination - the ability to 
<br>
increase motivation and also directly activate circuits of attention 
<br>
- is likely to be key to the beneficial effects of Ritalin.&quot;
<br>
<p>Earlier animal and limited human studies had indicated that Ritalin 
<br>
interferes with the recycling of dopamine within the brain by 
<br>
blocking dopamine transporters.  However, since these earlier studies 
<br>
involved injection of much higher doses of Ritalin, it was unclear 
<br>
whether the drug would increase extracellular dopamine at doses used 
<br>
therapeutically for children.
<br>
<p>Using a technique called positron emission tomography, or PET, 
<br>
researchers at Brookhaven's Center for Imaging and Neurosciences 
<br>
studied dopamine levels in 11 male subjects. In two sessions, the 
<br>
volunteers were each given a dose of Ritalin, calculated using their 
<br>
body weight to correspond to the doses given to children with ADHD, 
<br>
or a placebo. While their brains were scanned to record dopamine 
<br>
levels, the subjects were asked to rate their feeling of restlessness 
<br>
and &quot;high.&quot; Meanwhile, physicians monitored each subject's blood 
<br>
pressure and heart rate.
<br>
<p>The results showed that brain dopamine levels increased significantly 
<br>
approximately 60 minutes following ingestion of the drug as compared 
<br>
to the placebo. &quot;We now know that by increasing the levels of 
<br>
extracellular dopamine, you can activate these motivational circuits 
<br>
and make the tasks that children are performing seem much more 
<br>
exciting,&quot; said Volkow. &quot;By raising that level of interest, you can 
<br>
significantly increase the ability of the child to focus on the task.&quot;
<br>
<p>Volkow added that Ritalin also works to suppress &quot;background&quot; firing 
<br>
of neurons not associated with task performance, allowing the brain 
<br>
to transmit a clearer signal. &quot;Random activation of other cells can 
<br>
distract you, and children with ADHD are easily distracted,&quot; she 
<br>
said. &quot;Ritalin suppresses that background firing and accentuates the 
<br>
specific activation, basically increasing the signal-to-noise ratio 
<br>
and increasing a child's ability to focus.&quot;
<br>
<p>Volkow is now planning a follow-up study of subjects suffering from 
<br>
ADHD. &quot;We hypothesize that we will find that ADHD sufferers have 
<br>
decreased function of dopamine circuits and are therefore easily 
<br>
distracted,&quot; she said. &quot;The effect of Ritalin should be to normalize 
<br>
these levels, allowing them to focus and pay attention.&quot;
<br>
<p>The findings also have important implications for another research 
<br>
area - understanding why Ritalin, which is chemically quite similar 
<br>
to highly addictive cocaine, is not addictive when taken in pill 
<br>
form. One thing in common with all drugs of abuse is that they 
<br>
increase dopamine levels. Since oral doses of Ritalin do not produce 
<br>
a &quot;high,&quot; the Brookhaven researchers did not expect to see a 
<br>
significant increase in dopamine levels.  Since they did see a 
<br>
significant increase, Volkow postulates that another factor is at 
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>&quot;We've found that for drugs of abuse to be effective, they must get 
<br>
into the brain very quickly, and for that reason, when injected, 
<br>
Ritalin can become addictive,&quot; she said. &quot;However, when Ritalin is 
<br>
given in pill form it takes at least 60 minutes to raise dopamine 
<br>
levels in the brain. So, it is the speed at which you increase 
<br>
dopamine that appears to be a key element in the addiction process.&quot;
<br>
<p>The study's authors also included Gene-Jack Wang, Laurence Maynard, 
<br>
Samuel Gatley, Andrew Gifford, and Dinko Franceschi of Brookhaven's 
<br>
Medical Department, and Joanna Fowler, Jean Logan, Madina Gerasimov, 
<br>
and Yu-Shin Ding of Brookhaven's Chemistry Department.
<br>
<p>The research was funded by DOE's Office of Energy Research and by the 
<br>
National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of 
<br>
Health.
