<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
New lupus discovery
<br>
<p>University of California, San Francisco researchers have recently
<br>
discovered that a single defect in a protein causes a severe auto-immune
<br>
disease that resembles lupus.  Lupus is an autoimmune disease that can
<br>
have a range of debilitating consequences and can be potentially fatal. It
<br>
has been believed that lupus is a result of an accumulation of a number of
<br>
genetic defects, however this research, published in the December 22 2000
<br>
issue of the journal Cell, found strong evidence that a single mutation
<br>
can cause the disease and that the mutation is a dominant rather than
<br>
recessive trait, in which a single copy of the gene from one parent is all
<br>
that is required for the disease to manifest, making it highly more likely
<br>
to do so.  Previously identified genetic causes of autoimmune disease have
<br>
mostly been recessive.  What is called lupus may be a collection of a
<br>
number of different diseases with a common pathway, according to the
<br>
authors' views.
<br>
<p>The researchers found that a defect in the transmembrane receptor protein
<br>
on the surface of immune cells, which is central to nearly all immune
<br>
cells in humans and mice, can lead to the symptoms associated with lupus,
<br>
which include arthritis, kidney failure and inflammation of the heart and
<br>
lungs.  This protein normally receives signals from outside the cell,
<br>
leading to intracellular responses.  Acting on the results of previous
<br>
research, the scientists mutated mice to differ from their parents by only
<br>
one amino acid that would result in the defect in the protein.  As
<br>
expected, the mutated mice exhibited all of the symptoms of lupus.  The
<br>
researchers now hope discover this mutation in human lupus patients.
<br>
<p>Arthur Weiss, MD, PhD, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and
<br>
UCSF professor of medicine and senior author of the study commented,
<br>
&quot;Lupus is a devastating disease that affects one in every 2,000 people in
<br>
the U.S. - and attacks nine females for every male. But while researchers
<br>
have studied the disease intensively, the cause - or causes -- have proven
<br>
difficult to pin down. It may well be that at least part of the answer to
<br>
the puzzle lies with a very small change in a signaling protein that
<br>
underlies many different cell functions.&quot;
<br>
<p>The discovery of the defective protein will provide a target for research
<br>
on drugs to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOLS
<br>
Lupus
<br>
<p>Lupus is an autoimmune, inflammatory disease with multiple acute and
<br>
chronic manifestations. In its most common and serious form, systemic
<br>
lupus erythematosus (SLE), it is a potentially fatal dysfunction of the
<br>
autoimmune system. Instead of defending against invading viruses and
<br>
bacteria, the body's multitude of immune agents mistakenly identify our
<br>
own tissues as the enemy and attack the organs, blood, skin, joints, and
<br>
gastrointestinal tract. In its most life-threatening form, SLE produces
<br>
kidney, brain, heart, and lung inflammation. Even in milder forms, this
<br>
inflammatory process leads to arthralgia (joint pain), fever, fatigue,
<br>
mood changes, and other symptoms that may become disabling.
<br>
<p>It should be noted that there are two other common forms of this disease,
<br>
discoid lupus erythematosis (DLE), a less serious form primarily causing
<br>
disc-shaped skin lesions, and drug induced lupus erythematosis (DILE),
<br>
which is transient and subsides when the causal agent is withdrawn. A
<br>
further discussion of DILE will be provided later in this protocol.
<br>
<p>People living with chronic illnesses have nutritional requirements well
<br>
beyond those of the general public. The disease process places excessive
<br>
demands on the entire system while interfering with the ability of the
<br>
body to assimilate basic nutrients. It is hardly possible to nourish a
<br>
chronically ill person with the best of diets. Add the fact that SLE
<br>
patients frequently have gastric distress and variable appetites, and the
<br>
nutritional task becomes even more daunting. An early study by Cook and
<br>
Reading (1985) demonstrated the beneficial effects of nutritional
<br>
supplementation of SLE patients. It is essential for those with lupus to
<br>
take a regimen of a high-potency, easily assimilated, vitamin-mineral
<br>
product such as Life Extension Mix. Avoid the commercial one-a-day
<br>
formulations. Despite the public's fascination with finding a single magic
<br>
pill, it takes a number of nutrients to produce improved health, and that
<br>
cannot be combined into one tablet.

<br>
<p><p>Autoimmune diseases
<br>
<p>Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the body's immune responses being
<br>
directed against its own tissues, resulting in inflammation and
<br>
destruction. A wide range of degenerative diseases are caused as a result.
<br>
Immune dysfunction can cause immune responsive cells to attack the linings
<br>
of the joints, resulting in rheumatoid arthritis, or prompt defectively
<br>
functioning immune cells to attack the insulin-producing islet cells of
<br>
the pancreas, resulting in insulin-dependent diabetes.
<br>
<p>Supplementation with omega-3 essential fatty acids from fish, flax, or
<br>
perilla oils-along with borage oil, evening primrose oil, or black currant
<br>
seed oil, which contain the essential omega-6 fatty acid gamma-linoleic
<br>
acid (GLA)-can alleviate many symptoms of autoimmune disease through their
<br>
anti-inflammatory activity.
<br>
<p>One protocol used with a great deal of success involves daily
<br>
supplementation with 4 capsules a day of a concentrated fish oil
<br>
encapsulated supplement called Mega EPA, along with 5 capsules a day of a
<br>
borage oil preparation called Mega GLA. These two oils provide the
<br>
essential fatty acids that have been shown to favorably modulate immune
<br>
function and help correct autoimmune disease. For those who don't like
<br>
fish oil supplements, flax or perilla oils can be substituted.
