<p><p>Martial arts, especially the combat forms,  are very useful for

self-defense *within their envelope*.  Firearms dramatically extend the

<br>
arts, in fact they are complementary.

<p><p>The baseline properties for a defensive firearm is one with high 
<br>
reliability and reasonable accuracy that you can shoot well.  Given these 
<br>
things, everything else is gravy.  Firearms are extraordinarily durable 
<br>
goods; they will generally be as valuable in twenty years as they are the 
<br>
day after you bought them.  A well-maintained firearm can easily last a 
<br>
lifetime of use.  My oldest firearm (a Remington Model 17) is about 75 
<br>
years old and works as well as something I could buy new today.
<br>
<p>Cost of entry for a good pistol is about $300.  In this price range you 
<br>
have the CZ-75 (a high-cap military 9mm) or a number of different 
<br>
revolvers.  Most of the popular defensive pistols fall into the $500-700 
<br>
range.  While price is a good indicator of quality, it is not a good 
<br>
indicator of functionality -- some expensive guns are functionally poor 
<br>
(e.g. Desert Eagle) and some cheaper guns are functionally excellent (e.g. 
<br>
CZ-75).  Good brands are SIG-Sauer, Glock, Beretta, H&amp;K, Kahr, CZ (some), 
<br>
and Ruger (some).  The first four in the list are the Big Four of combat 
<br>
firearms and are all premium quality.
<br>
<p>And above all else, make sure you get quality firearms instruction 
<br>
ASAP.  Like martial arts, there is a substantial difference in 
<br>
effectiveness between someone who is exceptionally experienced in the art 
<br>
and someone who is just starting out.  Real life isn't Hollywood and you 
<br>
likely won't be able to reliably hit a target at rooms length if you don't 
<br>
have minimal training.
