<p>The fines should really hurt, and if the group has a lot of money, I 
<br>
guess it takes a large fine to make them hurt.  The same legal

principle is applied against big businesses all the time.  There's no

excuse in our society to let pie terrorist groups perpetuate assaults 
<br>
upon people whom they don't like.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I *do* approve.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, so you're now defining the level of assault that's okay?  I think 
<br>
that maybe after they catch some of these pie throwers that it's okay 
<br>
for the body guards to take the jackass to some back room and beat 
<br>
him to a bloody pulp.  Yay, isn't dispensing assault fun?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The application of the cream pie is a _symbolic_ assassination, not a real
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Defusing?  Utter nonsense.  Open discourse and reasoned behavior are 
<br>
ways of defusing &quot;socially dangerous tensions&quot; (however you define 
<br>
that for pieing Bill Gates in an airport (wasn't it in an airport?)).
<br>
<p>Throwing a pie is no better than slapping a person.  How can you 
<br>
construe such actions of attack as &quot;defusing&quot;?  They're clearly 
<br>
intended to strike out physically, which only leads to escalations - 
<br>
and with a pie, there's the added insult of having a damned pie 
<br>
hanging off your face.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Replacing real assassinations with symbolic ones is, if you ask me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a big improvement: the victim and the onlookers get the message, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nobody gets hurt. If every homicidal loon on the planet put down
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their guns and bombs and picked up a pie dish full of shaving cream,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world would be a much safer, not to say stickier (and arguably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;funnier), place.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, if every homicidal loon substituted pies for their weapons, I'd 
<br>
be with you.  That would represent a reversing trend of violence in 
<br>
the world.   However, the little groups doing these pieings weren't 
<br>
assassins anyway.  They were just doing standard protest stuff 
<br>
before, but now you're saying it's okay for them to attack people 
<br>
physically in order for them to express their viewpoint.
<br>
<p>I'm telling you: the loons are keeping their guns.
