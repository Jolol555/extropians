<p>I quite agree. What I suggest is that it would be
<br>
orders of magnitude more stupid to hand such things
<br>
over to something of greater &quot;capacity&quot;--because the
<br>
act would seem irrevocable.

&gt; &gt; Yeah but the point is, all power is not
&gt; concentrated
&gt; &gt; in a single individual. A leader who goes berserk
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; be stopped or killed. You hand all weapons of mass
&gt; &gt; destruction to an orbiting AI, you got problems.
&gt; 
&gt; A transhuman AI doesn't *need* weapons of mass
&gt; destruction.  So we may as
&gt; well minimize our problems by keeping WMDs out of
&gt; the hands of humans.
