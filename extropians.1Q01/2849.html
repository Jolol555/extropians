</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't have a problem with the old and feeble being paroled...such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; British 1950's organized crime figure who was recently paroled about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; month before his death (cancer I believe).  Perhaps *very* occasionally in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the face of overwhelming evidence that the prisioner has turned his life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; around and no further good is ocomplished by incarceration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; There may also be other rare circumstances for parole...possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; participation in dangerous medical experiments?  Though the bioethicists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; have ruled that one out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Prisons are sad.  Imprisoning each of the 2 million prisoners costs American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taxpayers about 60,000 a year each, not to mention prison construction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labor costs.  Two million times 60,000 is 120,000,000,000 dollars a year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe the cost per prisoner is actually only 15,000 dollars a year, which it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is not, then it would cost thirty billion dollars, a year.  Perhaps these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; numbers are lower and higher, but they are illustrative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The average cost is around $35,000. The $60,000 figure is for death row
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inmates specifically. Either way, for most non-violent prisoners who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not mentally ill, some say it would be cheaper to just cut them a check,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or maybe not. It costs around $60,000 a year per beneficiary to run the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare system (even though the average recipient only receives around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $10,000). So as long as they are not on death row, prisoners actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are cheaper than if they were on welfare on the outside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What this shows is that the prison and welfare systems are in need of a complete
<br>
overhaul, and significant cuts in funding.
<br>
<p>You notice that it costs less to imprison a prisoner then to provide welfare for a
<br>
non-imprisoned citizen.  What you do not remark is that you include the welfare
<br>
infrastructure, and not the prison infrastructure, in our estimates of these costs.
<br>
So, for the citizens to pay more than private university tuition for each inmate,
<br>
that does not include the prison and prison labor costs.  Also, it does not include
<br>
the great costs of human sufffering in prison, not to mention the &quot;crime school&quot;
<br>
effect of prison, as well compounded drug use and communicable disease.
<br>
<p>So, if the non-violent drug offenders were released today into workfare, not
<br>
welfare, it would cost society less than it does to imprison them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; American has the highest rate of imprisonment of any democratic country, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is absolutely pathetic.  Even ninety-nine percent of extremely violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offenders are not violent ninety-nine percent of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second sentence here is a non-sequitur. It makes no logical sense in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the argument. Just as a genius only needs to be brilliant once to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarded as such, a killer only needs to kill once to deserve the death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penalty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's true.  Don't be too fast to judge it, there is an old saying about the
<br>
sword.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not having been imprisoned, I wouldn't want to be.  Not being a criminal, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see less reason to imprison anyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, you don't have the sort of moral flexibility and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiative criminals do. You can't imagine why they do the things they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Initiative, yes, moral flexibility, no.  Money or lack of it is the largest cause of
<br>
crime, among idle hands.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When I was a high school student, the debate topic for the year was prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overcrowding, and how to resolve it.  Plans included decriminalizing drugs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We argued for the complete year the entire issue of prisons.  The other annual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; debate topics were space and the elderly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say cordon off selected areas of the country. Structure social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; services they depend on to only have offices in those selected areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Essentially set up communities such that criminals typically only kill,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rob, or hurt other criminals. Oh, yeah, we already have those. They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called cities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The urban violent crime rate, and violent crime overall, has dropped over te past
<br>
ten years.  Some property crimes have increased, and more people have been jailed
<br>
for drug offenses in the last fifteen years than for ever before.  For example, in
<br>
biblical times, when they were consuming cannabis, that was not a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sometimes this list talks about &quot;transparency&quot;, where for example public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cameras help deter crime.  Here's how it should be, all the on-duty cops and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prison guards are videotaped regularly, and only them, as it can be expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they would be in the vicinity of crime reports.  This video wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; available to the general public, nor any other public or private entity, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it would be available to any court proceeding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about this: weld a camera around the neck and embed a transponder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and taser into the skull of anyone convicted of a felony.
</em><br>
<p>Well, only if you get one first.
