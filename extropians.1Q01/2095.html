<p><p>Heh.  Seriously, people who have been using Oracle for years usually don't 
<br>
realize just how much they don't know.  Most people consider me to be an 
<br>
expert on Oracle development and I *still* regularly learn new and useful 
<br>
things about the product.  I don't know of any links to resources, but some 
<br>
of the third party books like O'Reilly's are good (avoid Oracle's books, as 
<br>
they are basically tree dumps of the online docs).
<br>
<p>To get the most out of the Oracle environment you need to know a few 
<br>
things.  Most importantly, you need to learn PL/SQL and learn it 
<br>
well.  PL/SQL is an Ada-like language (should be trivial for you, since you 
<br>
know Delphi), is very easy to learn for an experienced programmer, and 
<br>
gives you all the procedural constructs you need.  However, it has some 
<br>
quirks and oddities that nothing but experience will teach.  The O'Reilly 
<br>
book (PL/SQL Programming) is the best reference on the language that I know 
<br>
of.  The beauty of PL/SQL isn't that it is a wonderful language (it isn't 
<br>
-- much too verbose), but that you can embed PL/SQL procedural blocks into 
<br>
just about everything in Oracle.  You can mingle PL/SQL code with your 
<br>
SQL/commands/environment/etc in SQL*Plus (what you are looking for).  You 
<br>
can use PL/SQL to extend the SQL syntax (e.g. you can use custom procedural 
<br>
logic in your WHERE clauses).  There are also a bunch of standard libraries 
<br>
in PL/SQL that allow you to interact with various parts of the system 
<br>
(scheduling jobs, accessing files, etc).  Additionally, you can link shared 
<br>
libraries into Oracle and map the call interfaces to PL/SQL to extend the 
<br>
functionality and effectively give an unlimited number of 
<br>
capabilities.  And generally speaking, nothing runs faster for doing 
<br>
procedural database logic, though it is dog slow for many other things 
<br>
(like arithmetic).  The details of how to do all these things is in the 
<br>
documentation.
<br>
<p>The other thing you need to learn is SQL*Plus.  This is a pain, but 
<br>
necessary.  PL/SQL lets you do what you want, but SQL*Plus sets up the 
<br>
environment and controls the scripts.  But it isn't as important to learn 
<br>
SQL*Plus very well as it is to learn PL/SQL very well; if you don't know 
<br>
PL/SQL, you are missing out on a significant portion of the functionality 
<br>
in Oracle.  When everything is set up right and you know what you are 
<br>
doing, you end up with a relatively rich scripting environment that allows 
<br>
you to build your own components and tools in a fashion similar to Unix 
<br>
tradition.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;DBAs exist to keep developers from getting bored.&quot; - can I have this as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quote?
</em><br>
<p><p>Sure.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Do I remember that you do really scary code generation stuff? The memory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vague.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, but my bread-n-butter is system and application architecture on big 
<br>
Oracle systems.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
