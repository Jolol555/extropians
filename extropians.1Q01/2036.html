<em>&gt; &quot;The astronomer Fred Hoyle once remarked to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was pointless for the world to hold more people than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could get to know in a single lifetime.  Even if one were president
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of United Earth, that would set the figure somewhere between ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand and one hundred thousand; with a very generous allowance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for duplication, wastage, special talents, and so forth, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really seems no requirement for what has been called the global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; village of the future to hold more than a million people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scattered over the face of the planet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This reminds me of Plato and his Ideal State, which ought to contain no more
<br>
and no less than 5040 men... (Plus a number of women and children and slaves
<br>
of course)
<br>
<p>I don't think having no more than 100 000 people on Earth is a great
<br>
prospect. Come visit our country some time and you'll see what a restriction
<br>
having only 2 million inhabitants is: there seems to be a shortage of talent
<br>
in many areas.
<br>
<p>Having a large number of people allows one to fill various niches with
<br>
competent people better than if the number of people is small.
<br>
<p>Granted, this reasoning rests on the assumptions that talented human beings
<br>
are required for the population to prosper, and that variation is a good
<br>
thing. Someone outside of the human race may not view it the same way.
<br>
<p>Just my 2.35 Yen.
