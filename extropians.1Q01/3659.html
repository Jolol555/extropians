<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Wasn't the Gulf War about property rights?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was about enforcement of a UN Resolution brought by the Security

</em><br>
<p>You seem to be acting obtuse here. How is a neighbor state to not be
<br>
considered someone else's property?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At least, that's the official fiction. To the extent that the Gulf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War was about property rights it was *not* about British property rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other than in the very tenuous sense of protecting investments of British
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations overseas.
</em><br>
<p>So, then Chris is correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cynically, the war was fought to keep the price of gas down at pumps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across the US heartland in the run-up to an election.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. Weren't the British active participants in the Gulf War - using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lethal force to protect those property rights?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The British were active participants but their official reason for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being there was nothing to do with property rights. Period.
</em><br>
<p>Britain has always had a close relationship with Kuwait, the Emir's
<br>
family, and the Saudis. It was Lawrence, you might recall, who assisted
<br>
Abdul Aziz bin Saud in his conquest of the Arabian penninsula (Lawrence
<br>
was officially assinged to assist Abdul by the British Government at the
<br>
request of BP). Kuwait had been the country the Saud family had been
<br>
exiled to by the Hashemite's vassals that deposed them from Riyadh a
<br>
generation earlier, and the Emir had been the focus of intent campaigns
<br>
of influence from the British, French, Germans, and Russians for many
<br>
years. The Emir and the British backed the Saudi campaign that kicked
<br>
the Hashemites out of Mecca and Medina, and to keep them quiet, the
<br>
British installed Hussein royal butts on the thrones of Iraq and Jordan
<br>
(the Hussein king of Iraq later being deposed by Arab nationalist
<br>
parties, but Saddam Hussein is actually a distant cousin, which explains
<br>
the alliance between Iraq and Jordan, and their general animosity toward
<br>
the Saudis and Kuwait.
<br>
<p>Note that the Hashemites are descended from Hassan and his Asassins
<br>
(known originally as the Hashishim) from the last millenium.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3. Why is it okay to wipe out thousands of soldiers and more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; few innocents to protect property rights on a country scale, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not okay to protect property with lethal force on an individual scale?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not okay to do *either*. Period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please do not mistake me for the British government.
</em><br>
<p>I'm rather shocked that you claim to be some sort of libertarian but do
<br>
not accept defense of one's property as self defense. One's property is
<br>
the product of one's labor. Confiscation of the product of one's labor
<br>
is slavery. You approve of slavery?
