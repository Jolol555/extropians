<p>THE world's first hand-transplant patient has had his new hand
<br>
amputated after his body began to reject it, writes Adam NathanAdam
<br>
Nathan.
<br>
<p>The operation was carried out in London on Clint Hallam, a New
<br>
Zealander, after he had pleaded to have it removed. Earl Owen, an
<br>
Australian microsurgeon who co-led the international team that
<br>
performed the revolutionary operation to attach the hand in France in
<br>
1998, said Hallam had failed to look after it properly.
<br>
<p>&quot;He went without drugs for weeks at a time and failed to follow the
<br>
treatment plan,&quot; said Owen.
<br>
<p>Hallam had come to loathe his &quot;dead man's hand&quot;, saying he had no
<br>
feeling in it. He also had problems meeting the £10,000 yearly drug
<br>
bill.
<br>
<p>Nadey Hakim, a surgeon at St Mary's Hospital, London, carried out the
<br>
amputation on Friday evening in a private hospital. Hakim said the
<br>
operation was necessary because for two months Hallam had not been
<br>
taking the medication prescribed as part of the anti-rejection
<br>
treatment. &quot;His life was in danger,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Hallam, 50, who lost his hand in a circular saw accident in 1984, is
<br>
expected to be able to leave hospital tomorrow. He had declared that
<br>
his body and mind had said &quot;enough is enough&quot; and the hand should be
<br>
amputated.
<br>
<p>Hallam said for the first year, the right hand - which had belonged to
<br>
a French motorcyclist killed in an accident - had functioned well.
<br>
<p>But there had been constant &quot;pockets of rejection&quot;. He denied this was
<br>
sparked by failure to take medication.
<br>
<p>Previously he had talked of being &quot;mentally detached&quot; from the hand,
<br>
which was larger than his own.
