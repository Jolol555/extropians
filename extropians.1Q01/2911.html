<em>&gt; Mr. Marlow, you're a tough one to figure. I'm ready to stop trying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Just think it's more productive to focus on things that don't require 
<br>
the entire first world to go into debt for financing. Transhuman tech 
<br>
efforts--one man or woman can do something meaningful, perhaps 
<br>
stupendous. Nanotech efforts--the benefits (even of small steps) are 
<br>
such that companies and governments will pursue it. Colonies on Mars? 
<br>
Hey, I'm for it--but gimme a break. No one's gonna finance it. If we 
<br>
found out a rock was gonna pulverize this planet in ten years...no 
<br>
one would finance it.
