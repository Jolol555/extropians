<em>&gt;  Now, from my perspective, censorship of &quot;scientific&quot; results
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (by the powers that be) can only be &quot;unextropic&quot; by definition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The correct response would seem to be a justified, reasoned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  articulated expression of why such scientific explorations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  should be presented for public observation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I believe that it would be highly useful for situations like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  this to come under the focus of a national or international
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;rapid&quot; response team.
</em><br>
<p>A number of people have been thinking along similar lines lately, it seems.  
<br>
One problem I see is that, although there are many groups that have large 
<br>
areas of interest similar to those shared by extropians in matters of public 
<br>
policy and public discussion and debate, those groups are not coordinated in 
<br>
their actions.  This is in sharp distinction to the way that many folks 
<br>
opposed to the program of the Enlightenment have learned to carry on their 
<br>
work.  Radical greens, luddites and many groups whose policy goals are 
<br>
inimical to the liberty of the individual and progress in science and 
<br>
technology have learned through their activist backgrounds that coordinated 
<br>
action is fundamental to influencing public opinion and public policy.  They 
<br>
relish the political work of organizing and coordinating their various 
<br>
groups, something that folks on the technological and scientific side seem to 
<br>
see as a chore, at best.
<br>
<p>Consider all the many groups and individuals who do share our interest in 
<br>
liberty and progress: There are humanist and skeptic organizations, 
<br>
scientific and technical professional associations whose work is threatened 
<br>
by anti-progressive ideologies, libertarian political groups, 
<br>
technology-oriented businesses and business associations and science 
<br>
journalists.  I can imagine a well-crafted appeal to the leadership of such 
<br>
groups to nominate one or more people to subscribe to an email list, the sole 
<br>
purpose of which is to share news items and announcements of the type you 
<br>
mention, Robert, with the idea that such announcements and items would be 
<br>
forwarded on to the subscribers' respective constituencies for discussion and 
<br>
response.  The list could be run by ExI, but with no explicit &quot;extropian&quot; 
<br>
content, per se, as a service of our community to those who share our values. 
<br>
&nbsp;The big job would be identifying those to whom the appeal should be made and 
<br>
tracking down their email addresses.  I'd be willing to draft the invitation 
<br>
letter.
