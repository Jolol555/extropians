<p>This would result in isolating people from one another. It might be useful

for exploration of hostile environments, or fire-fighting...I don't see 
<br>
anyone wanting to live this way full-time.

<p><em>&gt;I think you're stretching it a bit. Speaking for myself, I would be very

</em><br>
<p>People keep doing this! Guns are neutral devices. You can use them to 
<br>
attack or defend, to hurt or to help. Like any other tool, they can be abused.
<br>
<p>Perhaps in the future there will be self-defense mechanisms available that 
<br>
will prevent attack without harming the attacker. At present, a handicapped 
<br>
person or a weak person is better served by either a sidearm or a bodyguard.
<br>
<p>Chicago, for instance, has outlawed guns, knives, brass knuckles, personal 
<br>
defense sprays, &quot;tasers&quot; and all other means of equalizing the relative 
<br>
strengths of attacker and victim. Of course, only the victim will heed 
<br>
these laws. Every day i read of fresh attacks, rapes, robberies, and 
<br>
murders using these devices in offensive mode. Successful defenses using 
<br>
any such device are rarely reported, not in the least because admitting to 
<br>
use of defensive aids is likely to get you arrested and thrown into a jail 
<br>
full of the very creeps you sought to defend against.
<br>
<p>It might not be a &quot;conspiracy&quot;, but it sure is a disturbing trend.
