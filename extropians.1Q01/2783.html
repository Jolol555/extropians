</em><br>
<p>As a long term programmer I do not believe that the programming space
<br>
does not have useful regularities.  I commonly exploit such in my own
<br>
work.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is a bit like Chaitins proof that most computer programs are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compressible and essentially random; if you choose a program at random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will likely be messy and the effort to understand it equal to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of bits in the program. When we program we build stuff from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modules, using small pieces of more irreducible code to build larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems. That is a nice subspace of the program space, but we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence AI is inside it, especially not the road towards greater and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is not my experience at all.  If a program has been written by even
<br>
a moderately talented engineer the effort needed to understand it is not
<br>
at all proportional to its size in LOC or bits.  It is true however that
<br>
having just the source or just the machine instructions makes it
<br>
difficult to extract the semantic meaning and intent.  
<br>
<p>We have no evidence that AI is not within a space containing high
<br>
modularity and reuse.  Especially if we use the human brain as an
<br>
example of the type of intelligence we are after.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Analogies work well for us humans because we usually live in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment, which does have a fairly regular structure. If you move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a mathematical environment analogies become noticeably less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient, at least in some mathematical branches.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That analogies work less well does not mean that only chaos remains.  It
<br>
generally (in mathematics) means that more specialized regularities not
<br>
analagous to other spaces apply.  I am not a mathematician but I know of
<br>
no branch of mathematics that is utterly devoid of applicable analogies.
