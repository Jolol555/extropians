<p>My favorite sheep joke- my SO, our son (then 4), and I were driving
<br>
through southwest Colorado, sheep farming country with a vengeance. 
<br>
Seeing that Michael was sound asleep in his car seat, I told his mother
<br>
the tale of a salesman, driving down a country road, who spies a man
<br>
buggering a sheep near the road.  Incensed, he stops at the next
<br>
farmhouse to Summon The Authorities, only to be greeted by a child.  Our
<br>
hero reports, &quot;There's a man out there abusing a sheep!&quot;  The boy says,
<br>
&quot;Thaaaat's my Daaaad!&quot;
<br>
<p>Although he had been unconscious, for the next two days Michael would
<br>
point at me and say, &quot;Thaaaat's my Daaaad,&quot; reducing his mother to
<br>
helpless gales of laughter.  I'm ashamed to say it took until the second
<br>
day for me to reply to her, &quot;Go ahead and laugh, but what's that make
<br>
ewe?&quot;
<br>
<p>Suddenly it wasn't funny any more...
