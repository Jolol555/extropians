PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE

<br>
Number 521  January 18, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, James
<br>
Riordon, and Ben Stein
<br>
<p>AT LAST! LIGHT BROUGHT TO A HALT.  For the first time,
<br>
physicists in two separate laboratories have effectively brought a
<br>
light pulse to a stop.  In the process, physicists have accomplished
<br>
another first: the non-destructive and reversible conversion of the
<br>
information carried by light into a coherent atomic form. Sending a
<br>
light pulse into specially prepared rubidium (Rb) vapor, a group at
<br>
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics led by Ron
<br>
Walsworth (617-495-7274) and Mikhail Lukin (617-496-7611) has
<br>
(1) slowed the pulse's &quot;group velocity&quot; to zero and (2) stored its
<br>
information in the form of an atomic &quot;spin wave,&quot; a collective
<br>
excitation in the Rb atoms.  (A spin wave can be visualized as a
<br>
collective pattern in the orientation of the atoms, which spin like
<br>
tops and hence act like tiny bar magnets. &quot;Spin&quot; is merely the name
<br>
for the tiny magnetic vector in each of the atoms.)  The atomic spin
<br>
wave is coherent and long-lived, which enables the researchers to
<br>
store the light pulse's information and then convert it back into a
<br>
light pulse with the same properties as the original pulse.  This new
<br>
accomplishment in a simple system increases the promise for
<br>
quantum communication, which may someday be used to connect
<br>
potentially ultrafast quantum computers in a large network
<br>
analogous to the Internet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually photons (the quanta of light) are absorbed by atoms,
<br>
destroying the information carried by the light.  With the present
<br>
method, in principle, no information in the light pulse is lost.
<br>
Previous efforts to slow light (such as Hau et al., Nature, 18
<br>
February 1999) have reduced the signal speed to about 1 mph
<br>
(Update 472) by using a process called electromagnetically
<br>
induced transparency (EIT; see Updates 37, 344 and Stephen
<br>
Harris's article in Physics Today, July 1997). Walsworth, Lukin
<br>
and colleagues have gone the rest of the way to a zero light-pulse
<br>
speed by using a novel technique which was recently proposed
<br>
theoretically (Lukin, Yelin and Fleischhauer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 1
<br>
May 2000; Fleischhauer and Lukin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 29 May 2000).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light storage experiment begins with the Harvard-
<br>
Smithsonian scientists shining a &quot;control&quot; laser beam into a glass
<br>
cell filled with rubidium vapor (about 70-90 degrees Celsius),
<br>
which puts the atoms into a conventional EIT state in which they
<br>
cannot absorb light in the traditional sense.  The scientists then
<br>
send in a &quot;signal&quot; pulse of light which contains the information
<br>
they want to store.  As the pulse enters the rubidium cell its
<br>
propagation speed is reduced to about 2,000 mph.  Since the front
<br>
edge of the signal pulse enters the cell (and hence is decelerated)
<br>
first, the pulse experiences dramatic spatial compression: from
<br>
several kilometers in free-space to a few centimeters inside the
<br>
rubidium vapor.  The light in the vapor cell interacts with the
<br>
atoms (see figure at <a href="http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics">http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics</a>),
<br>
changing the atoms' spin states coherently and creating a joint
<br>
atom-photon system known as a polariton.  (For a nice descriptions
<br>
of polaritons see Phys Rev Focus, 26 April 2000:
<br>
<a href="http://focus.aps.org/v5/st19.html">http://focus.aps.org/v5/st19.html</a>)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light-atom interaction causes the polaritons to act as if they
<br>
have an effective mass; so one way to understand the signal pulse's
<br>
reduced speed is that the mixture with atoms, in the form of a
<br>
polariton, effectively weighs down the otherwise massless photons.
<br>
Next, the Harvard-Smithsonian scientists stop the signal pulse of
<br>
light by gradually turning off the control beam, which causes more
<br>
atoms to be mixed with fewer photons, thereby increasing the
<br>
polariton mass and further reducing the signal pulse's speed.  When
<br>
the control beam is completely off the polariton is purely atomic,
<br>
the light pulse is effectively halted, and no signal pulse emerges
<br>
from the glass cell during the storage period.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point there are no photons remaining in the cell.  The
<br>
light does not go into warming of the atoms, as is the usual case.
<br>
Instead the photons are expended in the creation of the atomic spin
<br>
wave.  Thus, the information that the light pulse carried (all that
<br>
one can know about the photons) is stored in the atomic spin wave,
<br>
waiting to be released as a light pulse that is in principle identical
<br>
to the incident pulse.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative way to understand the slowing of light is to think
<br>
of the signal pulse as a wave made of many different components,
<br>
each with a different frequency.  The Rb atoms bend or &quot;refract&quot;
<br>
the individual components of the light by different amounts
<br>
depending on each component's frequency.  The vapor cell's
<br>
frequency-dependent index of refraction causes the component
<br>
waves to add together in such a way that the group velocity, the
<br>
velocity of the composite pulse, slows appreciably.  The dimming
<br>
of the control beam makes the vapor's index of refraction more
<br>
sharply dependent on frequency, and this serves to reduce the
<br>
group velocity further.  The dimming causes the atoms to become
<br>
transparent to a narrower range of frequencies.  But
<br>
simultaneously, the light wave (or more precisely, the combination
<br>
of light wave and atomic spin wave) is continually slowing down,
<br>
maintaining its shape but narrowing its range of component
<br>
frequencies so that the atoms are still unable to absorb it.  After a
<br>
relatively long delay the control beam can be turned back on,
<br>
reverting the polariton to being a light wave by coaxing the atoms
<br>
to emit the exact signal light pulse that entered the medium.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief: (1) the length of a light pulse is compressed from
<br>
kilometers to centimeters in a properly-prepared rubidium vapor;
<br>
(2) the information carried by the light pulse is then imprinted
<br>
upon the ensemble of rubidium atoms in the form of long-lived
<br>
spin waves; and (3) the light pulse can later be read out on demand.
<br>
This new light storage method is robust because information is
<br>
maintained in collective atomic spin states, which are much less
<br>
sensitive to dissipation, losses, and quantum-computer-crashing
<br>
decoherence effects than are excited electronic states in atoms.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists believe that the light storage method is quite general
<br>
and that the simplicity of its implementation is a big advantage.
<br>
They even speculate that the technique may be utilized in certain
<br>
solid-state materials.  The Harvard-Smithsonian demonstration
<br>
experiment is exciting news for scientists worried about preserving
<br>
the coherence of quantum information transfer.  With further work,
<br>
this technique should allow for the storage and transmission of
<br>
photon quantum states useful for quantum communication and
<br>
computation.  (Phillips et al., Physical Review Letters, 29 January 2001.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walsworth and Lukin say that a very similar result has been
<br>
recently obtained by  Lene Hau's group (Harvard/Rowland Institute
<br>
of Science) in an ultra-cold atomic gas.  In addition, an upcoming
<br>
theory paper (Kocharavskaya et al., Phys Rev. Lett., 22 January)
<br>
discusses a novel technique for making a light beam not only stop
<br>
in its tracks but reverse its direction; this effect could be useful for
<br>
non-linear optics applications.
