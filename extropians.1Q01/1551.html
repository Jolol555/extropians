If you're referring to this link, I don't follow. Obviously anyone 
<br>
attacking evolution is going to attract creationists, fanatical and 
<br>
otherwise, but the guy is referring to works such as Stuart 
<br>
Kauffman's.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.jamesphogan.com/bb/archives/evolution.shtml">http://www.jamesphogan.com/bb/archives/evolution.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>A sample:
<br>
<p>&quot;Two examples of the kinds of results that emerge--(very readably 
<br>
derived and easy to follow, I might add): 
<br>
Oddsagainst a new species coming into existence via the NDT, less 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than one in 102,700 
<br>
Oddsagainst the kinds of similarities conventionally explained away 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by &quot;convergence&quot; when impossible to explain by descent, less than one 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in 1054 
<br>
Pretty daunting, to say the least. 
<br>
One of the most interesting, and rarely attempted, aspects of 
<br>
Spetner's book is the application of information theory (he is a 
<br>
physicist, specializing in signal processing) to the NDT and its 
<br>
assumptions, with devastating results. Clearly, the DNA of all 
<br>
biological organisms constitute immense repositories of information, 
<br>
not only in the form of an assembly program to construct the 
<br>
organism, but also a maintenance program to regulate its functioning 
<br>
and behavior afterward. But it turns out that this information cannot 
<br>
have come about through the gradual accumulation of selected random 
<br>
variations in the way NDT says. The process simply doesn't have the 
<br>
power to create enough variety to be selected. And more, no known 
<br>
mutation or other instance cited of evolution in action has ever 
<br>
added any information to a genome. All have deleted from it. 
<br>
The bacteria that evolve strains resistant to antibiotics such as 
<br>
streptomycin, for example, do so by losing the specificity that makes 
<br>
it possible for the streptomycin molecule to attach. The much-quoted 
<br>
example of the British peppered moth that altered from predominantly 
<br>
light to predominantly dark when industrial soot darkened the tree 
<br>
barks that they settle on illustrates simply a change in population 
<br>
mix when the camouflage advantage of one type over another altered. 
<br>
No mutation was involved. Both strains were present from the 
<br>
beginning. Nothing genetically new was created. Yet these are among 
<br>
the textbook examples given of the strongest evidence in support of 
<br>
the NDT that can be found. 
<br>
In place of randomness, discredited as the driving force of 
<br>
evolution, Spetner develops a convincing case supporting the NDT 
<br>
heresy that the variation responsible for the big leaps of macro 
<br>
evolution is directed, induced by environmental cues. This is another 
<br>
way of saying that the genetic information needed to switch between 
<br>
different body plans is already in there, like a computer program 
<br>
written to function in different modes. Where it comes from is a good 
<br>
question, and random variation can't be the answer. 
<br>
Two examples that I found stunning: 
<br>
A   strain of e.coli bacteria was produced that lacked the enzyme 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needed to metabolize the milk sugar lactose, which is their normal 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food supply. Two particular mutations occurring together will create 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an alternate mechanism. The calculated chance of this variation 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming about through random mutation under the conditions of the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiment described was about once in a hundred thousand years. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, 40 instances were found within a few days. 
<br>
Speciesof finches introduced into a bird sanctuary comprising a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group of islands in the north west Pacific were found to have 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developed new beak forms in 20 years. The results suggest that 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variations qualifying in every respect as a new species could arise 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a single generation, a result utterly impossible within the NDT. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there it is. 
<br>
The explanation seems to be that the diet and eating habits of young 
<br>
animals profoundly affects the shape and form of things like beaks, 
<br>
teeth, jaws, and attached muscle structures that develop. In other 
<br>
words, there's an amazing amount of plasticity built into the 
<br>
program. This raises the intriguing question of whether the 
<br>
variations that Darwin observed in his famous Galapagos finches were 
<br>
in fact a product of the random variation followed by selection that 
<br>
he attributed them too, at all. And more. Since so much of the fossil 
<br>
record consists of just bones and teeth, how much of the differences 
<br>
conventionally interpreted as indicating evolutionary change might be 
<br>
simply differing expressions of the same genome to different 
<br>
environments, with no significant genetic modification occurring at 
<br>
all? &quot;
