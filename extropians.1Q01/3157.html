<em>&gt; &gt;Hmm. Difficult to know which to pick. Maybe the question of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;origin of the stupendous amount of information in a genome --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;... But _not one_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the examples usually cited in textbooks etc. as &quot;evolution in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;action&quot; has ever been found to add information, and so cannot count
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;as a meaningful evolutionary step. Bacterial resistance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;antibiotics, for example, (e.g. streptomycin) results from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deterioration that loses the molecular specificity necessary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;accept the antibiotic's deactivating &quot;key&quot; -- i.e. a loss of genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;information, not a gain
</em><br>
<p>Seems to be a combination of argument from incredulity (&quot;I find it 
<br>
impossible to believe, and therefore it's impossible&quot;), misrepresentation 
<br>
and straw manning of evolutionary theory.
<br>
<p>Many things were stuck into text books and claimed to be &quot;examples&quot; of 
<br>
evolution, mostly inaccurate, many downright false.  Remember the claim 
<br>
that the embryo went through a fast run evolution early in it's 
<br>
development?  They were examples of poor understanding of evolutionary 
<br>
theory, not of a poor theory.
<br>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Hogan has an explanation for the massive amount of &quot;junk&quot; DNA 
<br>
in genomes?  &quot;Intelligent&quot; Design?   If DNA were a designed object like my 
<br>
moped, it'd have extra wheels, a few more engines, loads of those little 
<br>
peg thingies that the pillion rests their feet on, more brake levers than I 
<br>
have hands, and blindingly numerous headlights, all of which wouldn't 
<br>
work.  (Hey, if creationists can pull out the old &quot;747 from a wind in a 
<br>
junkyard&quot; argument, they can indulge me;)
<br>
<p>Seems to me there's much more DNA than life knows what to do with.  No 
<br>
shortage of added &quot;information&quot; there....
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p><p><p>James....
<br>
<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
