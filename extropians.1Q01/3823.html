From: &quot;Jeff Davis&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;Rosetta may hold key to predicting protein folding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...predicting the three-dimensional structure of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; folded protein from its linear sequence of amino acids.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The article does not say what computational resources were applied to the
</em><br>
problem
<br>
<p>Is this Rosetta, as in Rosetta Inpharmatics, Inc(RSTA) of Seattle? This
<br>
would be one of the companies that Leroy Hood helped to start after leaving
<br>
the U-dub. Remember Hood? Gates brought him up from CA  to head a new
<br>
Molecular Biotechnology Dept at the UW. His departure from the U to enter
<br>
the private sector rustled some feathers I believe.

<br>
A statement that I found noteworthy in the article was:
<br>
<p>[&quot;Interestingly, some of our predicted structures were quite similar to
<br>
structures of proteins that had already been solved, and which turned out to
<br>
have similar functions to the target protein, even though there was no
<br>
significant sequence similarity. Thus, our predicted structures provided
<br>
clues about function that could not be obtained by traditional sequence
<br>
comparison methods,&quot; Baker said.]
