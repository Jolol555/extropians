<p>All true, Mike.  I don't dispute anything you said.  California does 
<br>
have a power deficit such that it must buy power from the outside.
<br>
<p>However, we did not see those outside suppliers run out of power.  We 
<br>
have not seen other states suffer blackouts such that they could no 
<br>
longer supply California.  When President Bush ordered the power 
<br>
turned back on, we did not see an inability to do so.
<br>
<p>What we did see is outside suppliers ready to sell power to 
<br>
California as soon as they came up with the money.  What we did see 
<br>
is outside suppliers go ahead and supply the power after President 
<br>
Bush ordered them to do so.  Now California is trying to figure out 
<br>
how to pay for the power now that the utilities are out of money.
<br>
<p>Nobody opened up new oil wells or struck new veins of coal to provide 
<br>
additional power.  What they are opening up are new bank rolls to 
<br>
purchase existing power, bankrolls that will probably come from the 
<br>
taxpayers eventually.  We need to fix the cost recovery pricing for 
<br>
electricity and the incomplete deregulation that lead to this mess. 
<br>
We do not need to produce more energy to solve California's problem 
<br>
of last week.  We need new energy sources to solve our over-all 
<br>
problems of the future.
