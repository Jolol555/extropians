I am 100% opposed to Mr. Joy's &quot;relinquishment&quot;
<br>
attitude--but the man has a point. If the consequences
<br>
of mistakes with nuclear weapons (or nuclear power,
<br>
for that matter) were as dire as those of mistakes
<br>
made with nanotechnology, I assure you, we would all
<br>
be dead already. Absolutely no question whatsoever.

<p>A few nights ago I was fascinated to see a brief
interview with Bill Joy on CBS evening news.  The
topic was &quot;robotic artificial intelligence&quot; and a
brief overview was given of some advances in this
area.  Then Bill Joy was shown(I had never seen him
before) and he summed up his quick comments with &quot;what
humanity can do, it will do, and so humanity will
destroy itself with these new technologies!&quot;  For such
a supposedly intelligent man I was taken aback by his
statement.  By his own flawed logic we should have
already destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons.
