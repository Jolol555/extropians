<em>&gt; Hmm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is a very deep, tough, and controversial issue. If we had a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not really.  I've argued with some of the best, er, worse, er...
<br>
It is not deep at all.  Do and teach science in science classes.  Leave
<br>
cosmogeny myths to other types of classes.  If you are going to be a
<br>
relativist about this you can at least do a bit of segregating of the
<br>
tree of relative &quot;knowledge&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Overall, I think the preprogrammed nature of the school system as we have it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the concept is the same over there as it is here) is a problem in itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The basic premise of education is that adults determine what kids should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn, and then these facts are rammed down children's throats. And kids who
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  If that is what education is then it would be a pretty
<br>
wrong-headed enterprise.  Education is about learning to think and
<br>
learning information gathered by those who went before you,  at least
<br>
enough to continue learning on your own as needed and desired.  It is
<br>
not about &quot;cramming information&quot; down anyone's throat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; can't cope with this awful approach are deemed &quot;problematic&quot;. Be it creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science or evolution - ideally, kids would learn what they want to learn, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time they want to learn it. [Although it probably does get more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated than that.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Kids don't know what they want to learn nor which basic skills will
<br>
enable them to learn it straight out of the womb.  While I agree that it
<br>
is important to teach the joy of learning and the practicalities of what
<br>
are fundamental tools, I don't think the average tyke is in a position
<br>
to organize ver own education.  Now after they learn some basic skills
<br>
and get exposed to more of the broad world, say by high school or even
<br>
junior high for many, earlier for some, more self-directed learning
<br>
would be appropriate.  At the least learning at one's own pace would be
<br>
an improvement for many. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think your assertion - &quot;such flexibility would lead...&quot; - is largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant, because what is taught in schools is probably not what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;right&quot;, it is what the majority wants kids to be taught. As in most human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicts, the decisive arguments here are arguments of force, not arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I utterly and totally disagree.  Teaching creation science and foregoing
<br>
the teaching of evolution is not undecidable on the basis of relative
<br>
merit.  It is not just a matter of who exercises or can exercise the
<br>
most force.  If the purpose of education is to teach what has been
<br>
learned before then leaving evolution out of biology or considering it
<br>
optional makes science education an utter sham.  
<br>
<p>If all that makes something right is MIGHT then it is a damn sorry world
<br>
we live in.  Do you really want to make this claim?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You and I are fortunate enough that what is taught in schools is largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (but definitely not entirely) compatible with the way we think. Catholic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priests are, well, less fortunate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Catholic priests can frankly go to the hell they invented to intimidate
<br>
the gullible.  :-)  Your position looks like total cultural relativism. 
<br>
I am not surprised.  What does teaching what we have learned through
<br>
science about the world have to do with pretending that various
<br>
pre-scientific myths are equally valid?   Are all myths and scientific
<br>
facts and theories equally valid in your opinion?  Clearly they cannnot
<br>
all simultaneously be true in regard to the same aspects of what they
<br>
purport to explain.  Why not simply teach the best of science in science
<br>
classes and teach these other things in classes examining comparative
<br>
creation myths?  In that class don't just teach the fundamentalist
<br>
Christian version but cover the entire spectrum of such.  
<br>
<p>In the US I believe we have a fundamental clash brewing between
<br>
fundamentalism (more deeply, anti-intellectualism/anti-reason) and
<br>
science/reason.  It is not brewing only here but its consequences will
<br>
be the most far reaching in the US pressure cooker.  If we can't manage
<br>
to act most often on what can be verified by science/reason in this
<br>
highly educated and prosperous country then how will we ever reach the
<br>
relatively undeveloped countries struggling between ancient culture and
<br>
modern knowledge and abilities?  If there is no basis but the size of
<br>
one's club for deciding questions then what hope of enough peace and
<br>
plenty to transcend our current massive limitations is there?  If reason
<br>
cannot/does not prevail here then where will it?  If the US becomes the
<br>
world's biggest theocracy then what would that do to the world and all
<br>
of our fondest dreams?
