<p><em>&gt; Let us save our species making peace more profitable than war.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not convinced this idea will work entirely the way you want it to.
<br>
<p>War is initiated by a group of people A who want to take control of another
<br>
group of people B by progressively threatening to destroy, and then actually
<br>
destroying, something group B holds of value. This continues as long as
<br>
group B doesn't yield to the pressure; if group B doesn't yield at all,
<br>
group A will eventually destroy each individual in group B until no group B
<br>
remains.
<br>
<p>Group B typically has only one way to counter: fight back. (If they don't,
<br>
group A has achieved their objective, and you have failed.) By fighting
<br>
back, group B mirrors the process undertaken by group A: they progressively
<br>
threaten to destroy, and then actually destroy, something group A holds of
<br>
value, until group A ceases to fight back.
<br>
<p>The point is &quot;actually destroy&quot;. The robots cannot be programmed to just
<br>
kill other robots and nothing else: the chiefs won't see a point in buying
<br>
such robots (and indeed, there would be no point). The point of robots is to
<br>
more effectively exterminate individuals and resources belonging to the
<br>
other group. If that requires exterminating the other group's robots first,
<br>
that must be done too; but the ultimate objective is being able to apply
<br>
ultimate, killer pressure onto each individual of the other group. We're
<br>
talking blood and lives here, that's the only way war works.
<br>
<p>If there is no outside intervention, then once initiated, the process of war
<br>
will continue until either group A or group B either yields to the pressure
<br>
or is destructed. In most cases, either case means that the winning group
<br>
will subvert the losing group, and only one group will remain. If a silent
<br>
conflict continues, it will not any more be a horizontal conflict, but a
<br>
vertical one: the previously winning group will have more resources on the
<br>
outset, and any remaining adversaries will be much poorer, significantly
<br>
more inhibited and less well organized. They will have great difficulty
<br>
buying any robots, so this is not any more a situation you can apply your
<br>
solution to.
<br>
<p>Now suppose you give group A a number of robots, and you give group B the
<br>
same number of robots. The two groups now start their war. If group A runs
<br>
out of robots first, group B has won. But your intention wasn't to have one
<br>
of the groups win! Your intention was to keep the robots fighting
<br>
indefinitely. But there's no way you can ensure that, and it actually won't
<br>
happen: a war of robots will expend resources faster than the groups can
<br>
replace them, and the group with the lesser amount of
<br>
resources-times-dedication will inevitably run out of robots first. So if
<br>
group A runs out of robots first, group B has won, group A will be
<br>
subverted, and so, you have failed.
<br>
<p>If group B runs out of robots first, group A has won, and you have also
<br>
failed.
<br>
<p>The only remaining possibility is that group A's robots and group B's robots
<br>
cancel each other out - e.g., both groups simultaneously run out of
<br>
resources to buy new robots. With no robots left, they will resort to more
<br>
traditional methods of waging war, and you have also failed.
<br>
<p>So, this whole strategy seems to be a fairly inevitable failure for all of
<br>
its humanistic aspects. The only aspect in which it is likely to succeed is
<br>
making fat profits from the sweat and blood of innocent people governed by
<br>
fools.
<br>
<p>Development of attack technology only expedites wars, it doesn't prevent
<br>
them. The faster wars happen, the more likely it is that one of the sides
<br>
will not be able to recuperate fast enough, and the other side will win. But
<br>
you don't want anyone to win. So this proposition is a no-no.
<br>
<p>It is only the development of defensive technology which might slow a war
<br>
down, thus contributing to the equalization of chances.
