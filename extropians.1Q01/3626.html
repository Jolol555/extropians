<p>Training has a lot to do with it, especially recently (over the last

century). The scientific literature in the 19th century was a lot less
<br>
spuriously objective and passive-voiced than today's journals insist upon.
<br>
Here's another bit of ARCHITECTURE OF BABEL, probably the segment I should
<br>
have posted originally:
<br>
<p>======================
<br>
<p>Classically, the ambition of scientists has been to eschew rhetorical
<br>
persuasions in favour of logical or empirical ways to convince peer
<br>
practitioners. Bishop Sprat's History of the Royal Society of London, more
<br>
than three hundred years ago, condemned the sonorities of Restoration
<br>
prose, calling instead for a limpid style purged of `this vicious abundance
<br>
of Phrase, this trick of Metaphor, this volubility of Tongue' (Sprat, cited
<br>
in Levine, 1987:11), and in general of the jargons which, bearing out his
<br>
fears, would constitute in later centuries so great a part of the barriers
<br>
between disciplines. Joseph Gusfield, in a pioneering effort at
<br>
investigating `the literary rhetoric of science', finds Sprat's desideratum
<br>
figured in a `windowpane' theory of scientific discourse:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of presenting ideas and data is to enable the audience to see the
<br>
external world as it is. In keeping with the normative prescriptions of
<br>
scientific method, language and style must be chosen which will
<br>
approximate, as closely as possible, a pane of clear glass. . . . The
<br>
writer must persuade the audience that the results of the research are not
<br>
literature, are not the product of the style of presentation. (Gusfield,
<br>
1978: 17) 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gusfield swiftly points out, on familiar constructivist grounds, that such
<br>
neutralised language, while approximated in scientific reportage, is
<br>
strictly impossible. (Nobel laureate Peter Medawar once made the same point
<br>
even more strongly, asking `Is the Scientific Paper a Fraud?' [Medawar,
<br>
1963].) What is more, the rhetoric of science is detectable not by
<br>
asserting an identity between science and literature but by treating
<br>
science as if it were literature, a step which is itself a metaphorical
<br>
conceit. `The style of non-style is itself the style of science. There is a
<br>
literary art involved in scientific presentation' (Gusfield, 1978:idem).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Gusfield's method is odd - he borrows from Kenneth Burke a number of
<br>
`dramatistic keys in use, examining the use of scene, act, agent, agency
<br>
and purpose' (ibid.:18), and of voice, in a paper by Waller on
<br>
`Identification of Problem-Drinking among Drunken Drivers', deploying them
<br>
in a pseudo-dramatic frame of his own - his major goal is laudable: to
<br>
develop `the literary genre of the scientific report', his topic `not its
<br>
content but its form' (Idem). Certain formal features are readily located,
<br>
some of them also deplored by Medawar:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The active voice is absent. . . . What this pattern of rejection of
<br>
personal terms or active voice does is to place the source of action in the
<br>
agency or method. . . . The style reinforces this externality and provides
<br>
the basic epistemological assumption; by use of the same method different
<br>
observers must reach the same conclusions. . . . The description is
<br>
minimally metaphorical. The intent is made to seem cognitive and logical
<br>
rather than affective or emotional. (ibid.:20)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the mechanisms here uncovered prove to have disturbing implications
<br>
for the politics of authority versus `criminals' and `victims' in the
<br>
drink-driving cases Gusfield studied (and for other social sciences), are
<br>
they less pernicious in sciences with inanimate objects? The familiar
<br>
positivist distinction between contexts of discovery and contexts of
<br>
justification may serve to sanitise the mandatory use of passive voice in,
<br>
for example, physics and chemistry papers. What is being obliterated is the
<br>
(usually messy) history of the item of research being reported. That
<br>
epistemological sleight-of-hand is, however, arguably consonant with a view
<br>
of science as a collective practice dependent chiefly on accurate,
<br>
dispassionate reporting of algorithms and procedures, and their reliable
<br>
replication. For all that, Gusfield's conclusion is surely valid: this is
<br>
only feigned transparency.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that Science is `reduced' to Rhetoric, and thus rendered corrupt
<br>
and useless. It is rather that the rhetorical component seems to be
<br>
unavoidable. . . . This analysis of Science as literature is by no means
<br>
inconsistent with `normal' science as a truth-begetting instrument. It
<br>
points, however, to the multiple realities in which and through which it
<br>
may be construed. (ibid.:31)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An entirely different approach is suggested by the psychologist Frank
<br>
Barron, in his contribution to a Festschrift for Arthur Koestler entitled,
<br>
appropriately for this discussion, Astride the Two Cultures (Barron,
<br>
1975:37). Employing standard psychometric instruments, Barron has compared
<br>
`many groups of artists, established masters as well as students, with
<br>
scientists and other non-artists of similar general intelligence,
<br>
educational and cultural level, and social class' (ibid.:43). His findings,
<br>
perhaps intractably implicit in his test procedures, bear out conventional
<br>
prejudices rather than revealing the commonalty which Gusfield discerns:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is tempting at first to emphasise the hidden community that lies back
<br>
of the very different countenances of art and of science, rather than to
<br>
try to sharpen our sense of their divergence. [. . .Their common] act of
<br>
imagination is in response to the problem set by external reality: namely,
<br>
to construe it, and to make the construction public. This is the common
<br>
bond of science and art.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet indeed they are different, in their means and in their effects.
<br>
(ibid.:37)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singular difference identified by Barron, inexactly, as he confesses,
<br>
is this: `science acts mostly upon the object, and is objective in its
<br>
methods, while art acts mostly upon the subject, and is subjective in its
<br>
methods' (ibid.:39-40). Regrettably, his elaboration of this position is
<br>
simply too crude, in view of the onslaughts of discourse analysis and
<br>
deconstruction, to be acceptable even provisionally:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science supposes a nature that can best be understood through mathematics
<br>
and rigorously applied common sense linked to imagination, while art
<br>
supposes a nature that can best be understood (or better, its meaning
<br>
evoked) through metaphor and intuition (in the sense of direct experience
<br>
rather than ratiocination and proof). (ibid.:40)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as mentioned, even applying mathematical models to the real is an act
<br>
of either metaphor or metonymy, rhetorical figures of similarity. Popper
<br>
and others have asserted that `intuition' is the source of those hypotheses
<br>
which precede rigorous `ratiocination and proof'. Structural and semiotic
<br>
studies of the arts make clear the formulaic and algorithmic character of
<br>
much artistic discursive coding and decoding. The two cultures are not so
<br>
readily legislated into difference.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, even in psychological terms Barron finds his dichotomy borne out
<br>
only in part. Scientists test out as superior in intelligence scores,
<br>
independent and resistant to `group-endorsed unsound opinions', combining a
<br>
need for order and closure with an interest in sources of apparent
<br>
contradiction and disorder, a ready grasp of the `intuitive and
<br>
non-rational' in their own style, and a strong set toward meaning
<br>
(ibid.:42). Yet the fourth of these five features was also specified as a
<br>
mark of the artistic. And a vacillating animus toward chaos and enigma,
<br>
versus closure, is of course notable in all but the most hackneyed of
<br>
artists (and critics).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artists, in Barron's study, are characterised by such routine appellatives
<br>
as spontaneous, temperamental, dreamy, intuitive, pleasure-seeking, daring,
<br>
and complex; high on keen observation and low on common sense (ibid.:44-5).
<br>
`Art is singular vision, communicated,' he declares. `It requires
<br>
intensity, freedom from the blinkers of convention, daring, courage to burn
<br>
the conceptual boats and strike into new territory,' and so forth
<br>
(ibid.:46). Once more, the differentiation seems feeble. Perhaps the
<br>
principal characteristic which remains when these parameters are winnowed
<br>
is the sense of scientists as typically more communal, `social' and sober
<br>
in their intuitive zest, artists as more hedonic, irrational and
<br>
individualistic. That these characteristics reflect collective practices
<br>
and ideologies at least as much as they do the internal dynamics of working
<br>
at science and art is beyond the discriminatory powers of
<br>
group-psychological testing apparatus. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot of this methodology seems to be concurrence with such recent
<br>
discourse theorists as Beer and Levine: `we might employ a less linear
<br>
cause-and-effect metaphor and say simply that both science and art are part
<br>
of a field of energy in which each continually acts upon the other'
<br>
(ibid.:38) - a field which, as feminist researchers have been at pains to
<br>
show, inevitably extends into the ideology of the culture as a whole.
<br>
Ludmilla Jordanova has noted the tardiness of science historians in
<br>
perceiving, for example,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how important sexuality has been as a model of natural relations, as in
<br>
areas such as alchemy or mineralogy; how closely science meshed with other
<br>
areas of human concern in exploring descent, inheritance, genealogy and
<br>
family trees;. . . how much scientific writings are permeated by sexual
<br>
language. (Jordanova, 1986:20)
<br>
<p><p>On Origins and Species
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of Gillian Beer's investigation into the
<br>
language of Darwin's texts is the extent to which she finds them
<br>
always-already on the verge of self-deconstruction. This is so for reasons
<br>
both intrinsic to their writer's problems in ordering and notating his
<br>
discoveries, and in the fundamentally provisional status of those
<br>
authoritative but secular propositions:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties which Darwin experienced in his writing gave lodgement to
<br>
interpretation, counter-interpretation, expansion, fracture, and renewals
<br>
of meaning. His is not a sealed or neutralised text. . . . The Darwinian
<br>
world is always capable of further description, and such description
<br>
generates fresh narratives and fresh metaphors which may supplant the
<br>
initiating account. (Beer, 1983:55)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beer discerns here a general trait of educated Victorian thought: the
<br>
romantic desire `to substantiate metaphor, to convert analogy into real
<br>
affinity' (ibid.:42). If Darwin's theory is precisely a theory of
<br>
dissemination, of slippage under chance variation selected not
<br>
teleologically but by brute staying power, this transition from analogy to
<br>
homology represents an opening for a reverse voyage back from hermeneutics
<br>
of text to hermeneutics of the real. Even as Darwin helps construct a new
<br>
world-view, his prose insists that his reader see this fabrication as an
<br>
uncovering of what is already there:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that [The Origin] is one long argument, but it proceeds by a
<br>
strange intermingling of acquisition, concretion, analogy and prophecy. For
<br>
a book thematically preoccupied with the past, the present tense is
<br>
extraordinarily predominant. This reinforces the effect of discovery, of
<br>
being on the brink of finding out, rather than sharing an already
<br>
formulated and arrested discovery. . . . (ibid.:48)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is exactly the class of rhetorical interpenetration of science and
<br>
literature, though in quite different forms, which Gusfield unpacked in
<br>
contemporary sociological and medical-policy documents. The question which
<br>
remains is the extent to which these rhetorical ambiguities echo processes
<br>
of discovery, permit or even urge the construction of alternative
<br>
hypotheses (which, if corroborated, would then perhaps tend to obliterate
<br>
their predecessors), or indeed instantiate higher-dimensional complexities
<br>
in the real world, complexities inevitably lost or blurred in the
<br>
low-dimensional `shadow' which is all discourse can contrive in its
<br>
attempts to model the real. In any event, Beer insists that Darwin's
<br>
language is anything but a monolithic, unequivocal instrument for the
<br>
notation of empirically-derived observations:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major questions raised by The Origin is how far metaphor may
<br>
overturn the boundaries of meaning assigned to them, sometimes even
<br>
reversing the overt implications of the argument. Seemingly stable terms
<br>
may come gradually to operate as generative metaphors, revealing inherent
<br>
heterogeneity of meaning and of ideology. (ibid.:55)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Levine, seeking Darwin's influence on his literary peers, worries
<br>
this same mechanism into a series of antinomies or aporia: Darwin's use of
<br>
apparent anomalies in support of his argument (Levine, 1988:248), the
<br>
conservatism of his gradualist dogma balanced and subverted by the sources
<br>
of novelty within his lawful world (ibid.:249), so that `Darwin's theory
<br>
can be used to expose by analogy fundamental contradictions in the
<br>
Victorian realist project' (ibid.:250). Above all, Levine concurs with
<br>
Beer's estimate of Darwin's rhetorical skill:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Origin persuades, but in an almost perverse way: it consistently
<br>
affirms its failure to make its case conclusively or to produce the
<br>
clinching piece of evidence, abundantly recognizes the most powerful
<br>
possible objections to the theory, avoids precise definitions of its major
<br>
terms, sets its most important points in the conditional mode. . . . [T]he
<br>
Origin seems not only to participate in the celebrated `decentering' of
<br>
humanity; it develops a quiet, erratic, but forceful attack on what we have
<br>
learned to call `logocentrism'. (ibid.:86)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it simply the tug of intellectual fashion that produces such a reading?
<br>
Levine is candid. In the longer passage from which this citation is drawn,
<br>
he qualifies what is to come: `Read carefully, or perhaps with the eye of a
<br>
late twentieth-century critic. . .'. This honest (partial) disclaimer is
<br>
expressed even more broadly at the outset:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these complications - the innumerable possible interpretations of
<br>
his arguments, biological and social, and the elusiveness of the science in
<br>
fictions - it might well be possible to find Darwin anywhere. One of my
<br>
problems, indeed, is that the argument is not. . . falsifiable. . . . I am
<br>
free to play the game any way I like, to draw on fluctuating notions of
<br>
`Darwinism' whenever I want to argue for his presence - metaphorically, at
<br>
least - in a text. (ibid.:13)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Levine's ambit is very large, taking in much more than Darwin's
<br>
influence on the Victorians (an important chapter, ibid.:153-76, deals with
<br>
thermodynamics, precisely that notion of entropy which Lord Snow found
<br>
absent in humanities-specialists) he is obliged at last to acknowledge a
<br>
kind of discursive dilution of this powerful influence:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Darwinian imagination persists in narrative, but its close connection
<br>
with gradualism, direction, meaning has been permanently severed. His way
<br>
of seeing has imprinted itself permanently on the imagination of the West,
<br>
but his presence is so diffused and various, so much part of the Freudian
<br>
mythology, of the deconstructive turn,. . . that efforts to trace it
<br>
further become futile. (ibid.:272)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is this bleeding into a general set of narrative strategies which
<br>
is the ambition of such a discursive theory of science and literature as
<br>
Levine's and Beer's. Darwin, says Levine, `had the power to imagine what
<br>
wasn't there and what could never be seen, and he used analogies and
<br>
metaphors with subtlety and profusion as his imagination actually defied
<br>
the experience that Baconian thought privileged' (ibid.:1). Arguably, of
<br>
course, Darwinism is no more scientific, in the sense of being falsifiable,
<br>
than Freudianism: it is perhaps a grand methodological perspective rather
<br>
than an ensemble of testable hypotheses. Nevertheless, it is paradigmatic
<br>
of the impact of the scientific imagination over `common sense', and its
<br>
method (at least in Darwin's pre-mathematical recension) is the one we have
<br>
seen described: a plot through a text woven of metaphors.
