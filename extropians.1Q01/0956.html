<p>
One of the biggest problems with the California power situation is the
<br>
fact that the prices AREN'T being passed through to the customers.
<br>
I'm getting billed $0.11/kWh, equivalent to $110/MWh, even when the
<br>
utilities are paying many times this much.  In such a system I have
<br>
no incentive to conserve.
<br>
<p>This is what the economists mean by inelastic demand - price changes
<br>
cause little change in demand levels.  Because of how power billing is
<br>
structured, demand is almost totally inelastic on an hour by hour or day
<br>
by day basis.  The utilities can cut demand a little by asking certain
<br>
business customers to reduce their usage (a deal which the businesses
<br>
agree to in order to get lower rates).  Beyond that the only way to reduce
<br>
demand is rolling blackouts, which may happen in the next couple of hours.
<br>
<p>If I had to pay fifty cents or a dollar per kiloWatt-hour when
<br>
the utilities are paying that much, you bet I'd cut back.
<br>
The shape of the demand curve would change and we wouldn't
<br>
have so many price spikes.  Look at figures 1-3 at the end of
<br>
<a href="http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/PDF/pwp081.pdf">http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/PDF/pwp081.pdf</a> and you can see how
<br>
the present system worsens price variability.
<br>
<p>See the chart at <a href="http://www.caiso.com/SystemStatus.html">http://www.caiso.com/SystemStatus.html</a>.  If the red
<br>
line goes up much higher, blackouts will happen.
