<p>I suppose when thinking of one color eating up another color by dirtying
<br>
it, but In painting, we mix and blend primary colors to achieve secondary
<br>
colors.  We mix red and blue to get the hue of violet; we mix yellow and
<br>
blue to get the hue of green; and red and yellow to get the hue of orange
<br>
in the visible spectrum.  While these are secondary colors, they are colors
<br>
and unless we use an intensely magnify the blended color to view the
<br>
individual pigments they are achieved by mixing and do appear to be mixed.
<br>
And then, of course, the idea of mixing colors may be a romantic illusion.
<br>
<p>An exception was George Seurat (1859 - 1891) founder of neoimpressionism
<br>
who developed the method of pointilism which was the placement (or
<br>
&quot;flicks&quot;) of one hue next to another hue (not mixing them) to achieve a
<br>
secondary color.  These tiny dots of brilliant color were supposed to merge
<br>
the viewer's eye and produce intermediary tints of color more luminous than
<br>
those obtained by mixing colors on a palette and then apply the mixed color
<br>
to the canvas.
<br>
<p>In digital pieces, we think we blend pixels, but they are still pixels.
<br>
<p>&quot;Lights of red, green, and blue wavelengths may be mixed to produce all
<br>
colors. b. Subtractive or colorant primaries magenta, yellow, and cyan.
<br>
Substances that reflect light of one of these wavelengths and absorb other
<br>
wavelengths may be mixed to produce all colors.&quot; (dictionary)
