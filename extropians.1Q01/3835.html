</em><br>
<p>I am libertarian and feel the same way, except that in my experience,
<br>
democrats are far more dishonest and corrupt than republicans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's one of the reasons I almost always vote third party

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'd be very interested in seeing more of the leftist crap that is being
<br>
spewed by the DNC, Terry McAuliffe, and his supporting special interest
<br>
groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for those ballots, my brother lives in Palm Beach County and is one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people whose ballot was thrown out. He is an intelligent, capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who has been voting in the same location for many years. He told me
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; just some poor schlub of a volunteer being lazy, but is symptomatic of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much larger problem.
</em><br>
<p>Do you mean he screwed up his ballot right away because he thought he
<br>
was too intelligent to have to read the directions?
<br>
<p>Now, if he did not pursue charges against the poll worker, thats his
<br>
problem. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, we don't have a president.
</em><br>
<p>The system worked, despite democrat controlled districts across the
<br>
country not counting over 2 million absentee ballots (which, when
<br>
counted, supported Bush by 60%, which would have given him the popular
<br>
vote if they were counted). You are just being a pouty little spoil
<br>
sport, like leftists usually are. Its rather indicative of Dems in
<br>
general: when the GOP took over congress in 1994, the Dems actually
<br>
thought they would keep their comittee chairmanships, majority seats on
<br>
comittees, and preferred offices, and got rather snooty about giving
<br>
them up.
<br>
<p>THe fact is that Bush got far more votes, and a far greater percentage
<br>
of the vote than Clinton ever got, yet you don't see anyone on the GOP
<br>
side whining about him being legitimately elected.
<br>
<p>The fact is that the hand recounts conducted to date by Miami-Dade
<br>
Herald actually wound up giving 6 more votes to Bush than to Gore, so
<br>
leftist claims of a 'stolen' election are, again, false, whining,
<br>
propagandizing. Get over it, grow up, give it up, admit the truth. You
<br>
may not like the outcome. I didn't like the outcome of '92 or '96. I
<br>
thought that Clinton was a philandering, dishonorable, traitorous SOB,
<br>
but I did not in any way claim that he was not legitimately the
<br>
President. Despite him admitting to being a liar, a perjurer, abusing
<br>
his office, violating his oath of office, selling out the presidency,
<br>
conducting fishing expeditions against political opponents with hundreds
<br>
of illegally obtained FBI files, I did not pout about him getting off on
<br>
the impeachment trial thanks to Democrats throwing truth to the winds in
<br>
the name of political advantage.
<br>
<p>Gore has been cheated of the Presidency, but not by Bush. Clinton should
<br>
have been out of office over a year ago. Its Clinton who cheated Gore of
<br>
the job. If Clinton was not such a pathetic president, Gore would likely
<br>
have won. If Clinton hadn't approved Reno's Elian stormtrooper raid,
<br>
Gore would have won Florida by a statistically significant margin.
<br>
<p>The fact is that the variability in the Florida vote, using those voting
<br>
machines, was a statistical error at a minimum of 600 votes, within
<br>
which Bush had a slight advantage. Even if it were legally possible to
<br>
call a voter tie, the popular vote does not select electors to the
<br>
electoral college. The Legislature selects who goes to Washington, and
<br>
Congress chooses who to accept. Since both bodies were Republican
<br>
majority bodies, what makes you think that in a statistical tie that
<br>
they would select anybody BUT GOP electors?
<br>
<p>The fact is that there are so many quite Constitutional mechanisms which
<br>
were against Gore winning the electoral vote that you really have no
<br>
basis whatsoever to claim that Bush isn't the President. Its just
<br>
nothing but typical leftist whining.
