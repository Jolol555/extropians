<p>Nukes are macroscopic, made from rare elements with high infrastructure
<br>
costs and don't autoreplicate. Isolated deployment is negligeable, massive 
<br>
deployment is not Armageddon class in respect to biological life, 
<br>
especially humanity. Gdeaths you'll get, albeit with (noncamouflageable)
<br>
investments on the , but not sustainable kill.
<br>
<p>Molecular weapons (industrial use is safe with minimal design-level
<br>
and environment precautions) are microscopical, made from ubiquitous 
<br>
elements and do autoreplicate. Exact impact is of olive nano unknown 
<br>
but due to estimations I think you can only achieve a dynamic 
<br>
weapon-countermeasure equilibrium, at great running costs to anything 
<br>
organic. Deployment of microscopic amounts can easily become irreversible.
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology is a metatechnology, a great enabler of other technologies,
<br>
most of them not yet invented/nonviable. I have great respect against
<br>
conventional weapons of mass destruction (ABC), but machine-phase 
<br>
molecular autoreplicators (N) are in an utterly different class.

<p><em>&gt; how simply increasing the possible consequences would cause us to *reduce*

</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite.
</em><br>
<p>Fissibles are quite easily controlled. Much more difficult with a virus
<br>
design kit, and quite impossible with nanotechnology, which provides and
<br>
propagates means for its own production. As soon as Pandora's box is open,
<br>
there's no going back.
