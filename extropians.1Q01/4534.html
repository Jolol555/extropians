<p><p>The object of a mutual fund is making money, not the unqualified investment 
<br>
in companies that make things you like.  Buying publicly traded stock on 
<br>
the market doesn't benefit the company (ignoring minor secondary effects), 
<br>
so you aren't doing them any favors.
<br>
<p>A better strategy is to invest in good companies that don't do anything you 
<br>
don't like (say, donating money to HCI, for example).  About half the 
<br>
companies on your list are marginal or speculative investments that would 
<br>
probably do relatively poorly as a group.  For example, gun companies are 
<br>
generally a poor investment -- I wouldn't qualify their outlook as 
<br>
particularly high growth.
<br>
<p>I think the point of this exercise is to use our collective foresight to 
<br>
predict what companies are likely to be the leaders in technology fields 
<br>
that will become huge (and profitable) in the future, gaining growth via 
<br>
our presumed ability to accurately identify important ground floor 
<br>
technology ventures so that we can profit from explosive growth.  Balance 
<br>
that with a few smart blue chips like IBM and Merck, and you have a good 
<br>
basis for a mutual fund.
