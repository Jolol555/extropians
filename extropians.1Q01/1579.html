There are various ways to generate power where there is the technology to extract
<br>
form this process electricity.
<br>
<p>For example, there is hydroelectric power, nuclear power (fission and fusion),
<br>
chemical combustion power (gas, oil, coal), wind power, solar power, geothermal
<br>
power, etc.
<br>
<p>Which of these is the most energy and cost efficient, where cost is measured in
<br>
capital and environmental terms?  I would say nuclear power is probably the most
<br>
efficient.
<br>
<p>Here's an idea, put two big concrete pilings a mile or so part. in the ocean where
<br>
they are a quarter mile apart and hundreds of feet from the surface.  Surround the
<br>
area around the two pilings with an electric chain fence to discourage alge growth
<br>
and fish swimming into the area.  Between the two pilings, hang a set of louvers
<br>
that swing back and forth.  As the ocean current flows through, which it regularly
<br>
will, then the kinetic energy could be converted to power.   Perhaps better, have
<br>
an algae bank above it in a bubble growing methane and burning it there for power
<br>
to be retransformed into methane through alternate algae photosynthesis, which
<br>
could also start air repair.
<br>
<p>Some people have states ideas of beaming power from space.  The way this happens
<br>
is that power is generated on the lit side of the moon using solar cells.  Then
<br>
this is beamed using high-power microwaves to those areas in the line of sight
<br>
where it is required.  Drawback:  misaligned microwave cooks area.
<br>
<p>We're talking about electrical equipment, I wonder what the order is in terms of
<br>
consumption of these products:  green pc, green monitor, iron, electric stovetop
<br>
range, electric furnace, stereo, large television, 100W light bulb, dishwasher,
<br>
microwave.  These are some typical home products.
<br>
<p>The price cap on power sounds kind of socialist or fascist.  It could probably use
<br>
some reregulation.
<br>
<p>I think if the use nuclear power were tripled or perhaps quadrupled in the United
<br>
States, and the rollout of superconductor in products and local links to increase
<br>
efficiency were done, then there would be a better situation.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Solar and wind power are already not more expensive than fossil fuels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you happen to live way off the grid, and would have to pay for the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; only go up, and PV (and I guess aeolian) generators go down, the islands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of profitability can only grow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, decentralized power generation (in extreme cases rolling your own)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does have important synergies. Reliability goes up due to redundancy (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case a power grid island overloads, you can temporarily separate it from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grid, so only a small fraction of the grid blacks out), you don't have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transform up to high voltages (less hardware) to minimize transportation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losses, you get cleaner power (a problem I noticed in the U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots of spikes and glitches), can use heat (less lossage due to short average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distances), and couple consumers and producers much more tightly (which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Good Thing).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Makes sense, eh?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now it should be quite profitable to use large (several 100 kW)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-temperature natural gas fuel cells for clusters of homes, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually, natural gas reformers and low-temperature hydrogen fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells should become available. Since they burn hydrogen, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interoperate with photovoltaics and water electrolysis very nicely --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the long run reducing dependancy on the fossil (though rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abundant and hydrogen-rich) fuel methane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My power company has some plan where you can &quot;sponsor&quot; a windmill. You can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just buy power from them which has been windmill generated (and which is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simplest most effective way to support alternative energy supplies), because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's illegal for them to sell it. They're required by law to offer only the
</em><br>

</em><br>
