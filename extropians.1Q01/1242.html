<br>
electromagnetic pulse (EMP): 1. The electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear
<br>
explosion caused by Compton-recoil electrons and photoelectrons from photons
<br>
scattered in the materials of the nuclear device or in a surrounding medium. The
<br>
resulting electric and magnetic fields may couple with electrical/electronic systems to
<br>
produce damaging current and voltage surges. May also be caused by nonnuclear
<br>
means. 2. A broadband, high-intensity, short-duration burst of electromagnetic
<br>
energy. Note: In the case of a nuclear detonation, the electromagnetic pulse consists of
<br>
a continuous frequency spectrum. Most of the energy is distributed throughout the
<br>
lower frequencies between 3 Hz and 30 kHz.
<br>
<p>[from elsewhere]
<br>
The amplitude, duration and polarization of the wave depend on the location of the
<br>
burst, the type of weapon, the yield, and the relative position of the observer. The
<br>
electric field resulting from a high-altitude nuclear detonation can be on the order of
<br>
50 kilovolts per meter with a rise time on the order of 10 nanoseconds and a decay
<br>
time to half maximum of about 200 nanoseconds. It is very fast.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; magnetic field is rather I weak I seem to recall, and then you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to get through both the heliopause and the earth's magnetopause.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, I was assuming a source energetic enough to penetrate the heliopause
<br>
and the geopause (well, it is supposed to be a violent event). Of course, the 
<br>
braking of charged particles will give a more slowly rising EMP, until the 
<br>
stream can directly impact the atmosphere.
<br>
<p>Somebody stop me before I produce any more nonsense.
<br>

<em>&gt; What is the energy density per square meter of a dangerous EMP? I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen talk about terawatt pulses, but it is not clear what the energy
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>According to above source, NEMP produces edges of 10 ns duration and 
<br>
total pulse duration of ~200 ns. How about GRBs? These are short
<br>
and bright.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; would be on the order of 1/2 e_0 E^2 * t, or 0.0011 J/m^2.  Take that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and multiply with 4*pi*6.4e7 pc^2 to get the total energy = ~10^40 J
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of electric energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That seems to be be between the 6 x 10^{37} joules of Nova Persei
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://physics.hallym.ac.kr/reference/scales/scales1p.html">http://physics.hallym.ac.kr/reference/scales/scales1p.html</a>).  Hmm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually far less than than I expected. If a type II supernova managed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to convert its photon energy into EMP with an efficiency of 3e-5, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it could do it. Somehow I doubt it would happen though. The fields we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about galactic dynamos like active galaxies with jets? Or
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If you'd were to look down the axis of something like

you'd be probably rather shocked, too ;)
