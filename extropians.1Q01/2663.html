<em>&gt; &gt;Here's the rub: People who enter these altered

<p><em>&gt;From my own experiences I both agree and disagree.  As these things are

experienced as being from or of something deeper than the mind and
<br>
reasoning they can tend to make the mind seem an inferior means of
<br>
knowing.  This possible consequence can disarm the person toward greater
<br>
creduility.  However, I often find that I tend to self-originate memes
<br>
in this state more than simply accept existing ones.  I don't think I am
<br>
unique in that.  Many established religions distrust people having such
<br>
experiences because these people tend to feel they have their own direct
<br>
perception of what the religion is after all supposed to be about and
<br>
thus they tend to drift away from the official dogma. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; This is cognate with what social scientist Lucien Lévy-Bruhl called
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>These are very different states of mind.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;But what would happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;if an individual entered an experiential state of feeling one with
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mmmmmm. Glazed....
</em><br>
<p>I like glazing, as long as it is sweet. :-)
<br>
<p>Seriously though, the state of oneness is a lot more than simple
<br>
non-differentiation.  One can get simple non-differentiation from being
<br>
sufficiently drunk after all.  It is not at all difficult to go zooming
<br>
along the implications of evolving and self-evolving intelligences and
<br>
individual intelligences linking into larger intelligence and lifetime
<br>
within VR universes and such and end up with a very holistic, since of
<br>
the unity of all minds type of perspective.  It is very easy to get
<br>
quite high on these ideas and possibilities.  I don't believe that is a
<br>
bad thing at all.  I even think a bit of that is necessary to break up
<br>
old small, limited, bio-self thinking.
<br>
<p>Dream on!
