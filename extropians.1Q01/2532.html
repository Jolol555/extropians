SPOILER ALERT

<em>&gt; I'm thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly that the unfolding of events in this movie fits Eliezer Yudkowsky's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterization of the Singularity as being initiated by a runaway positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback loop.  I hadn't fully appreciated this before.  However, in the movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's an accidental Singularity, not anticipated or planned either by Colossus'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designer Charles Forbin or the computer's primary user, the U. S. government.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The subject matter of this movie is probably too dark ever to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully parodied on _Mystery Science Theater 3000_
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the Singularity Institute's Board of Directors just recently
<br>
watched this movie.  All three of us.  Silhouetted against the screen.
<br>
<p>Leaving aside such MST3K-type material as watching a punched-tape computer
<br>
depicted as an AI (roughly equivalent to seeing a propeller airplane
<br>
flying through space), I would not say that I was sympathetic to Forbin
<br>
through this movie.  It looked like something that would appear on a Fox
<br>
video special called &quot;World's Most Predictable Disasters&quot;.
<br>
<p>To surf out the Singularity, you accept the fact of a hard takeoff, design
<br>
for it, and plan for it.  You don't build a huge self-improving AI and
<br>
then act all *shocked* when the AI improves itself beyond recognition. 
<br>
That's just blind gibbering incompetence.
<br>
<p><p>To recall some of the MST3K-type comments heard:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; DR. BLAKE MILLER:  Well, we're still boss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FORBIN:  Are we?
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer (in Forbin's voice):  &quot;That didn't take long, even by our
<br>
standards.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; CLEO MARKHAM:  It's not your fault!
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer (exasperated):  &quot;Yes it is!&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Perhaps the most reasonable interpretation is that Forbin is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a deeply divided man, unable to get past his ambivalence toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the long-term implications of his chosen career (an ambivalence something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Bill Joy's angst, or as professed by Hugo de Garis and Kevin Warwick).
</em><br>
<p>People who enjoy marinating in the melodramatic angst of being deeply
<br>
divided shouldn't become neurosurgeons, generals, futurists, or Friendly
<br>
AI programmers.
<br>
<p>This is a high future-shock profession, and the part of the job is being,
<br>
if you'll pardon a &quot;Men In Black&quot; metaphor, the one asking the aliens for
<br>
their passports while everyone else is running around screaming.
