<p><p>People don't strip mine that which they have to maintain in 
<br>
perpetuity.  Companies take much better care of land that they own than 
<br>
land that they lease for resource extraction.  Unfortunately, the 
<br>
government has forcibly bought up a lot of resources, so companies are 
<br>
often required to lease land as part of their business.  Timber companies 
<br>
don't clear cut their vast tracts of private forest; they run them like 
<br>
farms instead, generating successive generations of timber.  The only 
<br>
clear-cutting I've seen (and I've seen it a few different parts of the 
<br>
Pacific Northwest) has been under the supervision of the government on 
<br>
government land.
<br>
<p>BTW, what makes you think that so many groups interested solely in making a 
<br>
profit isn't in the best interest of the long-term survival and quality of 
<br>
life of the human species?  Most quality of life is generated by groups 
<br>
looking solely for a profit, and those same groups have certainly improved 
<br>
the odds of the survival of the human species.  You must be using a rather 
<br>
arbitrary and exclusionary definition of &quot;better for people&quot;.  Sounds like 
<br>
a knee-jerk &quot;evil corporation&quot; meme to me.
