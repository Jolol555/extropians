<p>&quot;...The premise hasn't changed at all from the Japanese version
<br>
- the game progresses exactly like it does in the House of the
<br>
Dead 2 version, except that now each enemy has a small box
<br>
with a certain word or phrase written in it. Each character in
<br>
the word is similar to a bullet - it slows the enemy's slow
<br>
stagger towards you, eventually falling the enemy when the
<br>
word is completed. More powerful enemies have more
<br>
complex words, and the later stages actually contain complex
<br>
phrases and stories. Boss characters each have their own
<br>
particular quirk - some bosses restrict the periods of time
<br>
you can type, while others make you answer trivia questions
<br>
by typing out the correct answer from a list of several
<br>
possible answers. While this may seem a little odd, the
<br>
gameplay is actually quite addicting and very fun to play.
<br>
Most of the phrases and words are quirky and there are
<br>
plenty of pop-culture references thrown in. It's not
<br>
uncommon to take down an enemy with a phrase like
<br>
&quot;Vanilla Ice&quot; or &quot;Hello Neuman.&quot; However, Sega reminded
<br>
us that this is still an early version of the game, and some of
<br>
the references might be pulled due to licensing or judgment
<br>
issues. The game will also feature several mini-games that
<br>
are designed to improve your accuracy, quickness, and
<br>
alertness, and features tests designed to rate you in those
<br>
areas....&quot;
