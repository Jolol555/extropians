It is. I think Tor did him a disservice by publishing volume #3 of a four-
<br>
part series as the first book in the 'States; their official reason for
<br>
doing so was that the weird politics in the first two books would be likely
<br>
to confuse American readers. (If you can, try reading them in order: The
<br>
Star Fraction, The Stone Canal, The Cassini Division, and finally The Sky
<br>
Road. The last of which puts an _entirely_ different perspective on what's
<br>
been going on in the first three books ...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess the point I was trying to make is that it may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever be possible, or even desirable, to candy-coat this stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the masses.  Most people still get the screaming meemies

<em>&gt; at the sort of universe that modern science rubs Man's face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in -- particularly the Darwinian vision of life.  Any film buffs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember Katherine Hepburn as Violet Venable in the movie
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; poet son Sebastian's reaction to seeing the birds swoop down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the newly-hatched sea turtles during a visit to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Encantadas?  That's what I mean.
</em><br>
<p>Most people want security, most of the time. They don't want the
<br>
existential equivalent of a war, sweeping through their life, killing
<br>
people, destroying their homes and forcibly uprooting and changing them
<br>
-- and this level of change will have much the same social effect as a
<br>
major war. (It'll be profoundly debilitating to people who haven't been
<br>
trained to deal with change.)
<br>
<p>I suspect this is a side-effect of our current or past life expectancy;
<br>
if you can only live seventy-odd years, have to spend thirty percent
<br>
of your working hours doing profoundly boring or irrelevent nonsense
<br>
in order to earn a living, and the process of raising children/buying
<br>
a house and becoming socially secure costs you twenty to thirty years
<br>
of work, then conservativism when confronted with change in unknown
<br>
directions is a rational response: the perceived risk of embracing change
<br>
unconditionally is far too high.
<br>
<p>As the *nature* of the changes becomes clearer, and they're demystified,
<br>
expect resistance to diminish. Witness, for example, current attitudes
<br>
towards IVF (read: &quot;test tube babies&quot;) with the silliness twenty to
<br>
thirty years ago when the technology was first emerging on the popular
<br>
horizon. For example, I expect the clone-phobia to vanish around the
<br>
time that vets begin putting up adverts saying &quot;we can clone you an
<br>
identical twin of your beloved but elderly pet Fluffy&quot;.
