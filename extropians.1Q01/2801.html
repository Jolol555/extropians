<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But our present system isn't working very well either. Not for the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; majority of people living within it. Most people spend the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their time doing things they don't want to be doing. For most people, life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot be said to be joyful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This may be true, but the problem is this.  Almost half of all people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;live in China or India.  I've never been there and I know little about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their culture.  Any analysis of what &quot;most people&quot; do must be based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lifestyles in these countries and other countries where the bulk of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people in the world live.
</em><br>
<p>I was referring to the population of the world when I said most people 
<br>
spend the majority of their time doing things they don't want to be 
<br>
doing.  I've never been to China or India, but I've known people from both 
<br>
places. From what they tell me and from what I've read, it seems that the 
<br>
majority of the people there spend more time working than people in the US 
<br>
and most of the work is pretty tiring and definitely not what you'd call 
<br>
fun or uplifting.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Most people are, by Western standards, very poor.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is what I've heard too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It may well be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most people do not experience much joy in life.  I don't know; I've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spoken with a poor Chinese peasant.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't either, but I've spoken to poor peasants in other places, and the 
<br>
work they do seems to be tiring, and the pay is low. In general the people 
<br>
age more quickly than people of our culture do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But if we hope to improve the lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of most people, we should not analyze their situation in the context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Western middle class lifestyle.
</em><br>
<p>You have to take people where and as they are. The Western middle class 
<br>
lifestyle impacts the lives of poor people throughout the world, sometimes 
<br>
in good ways, other times in bad. As technology continues to advance, I'd 
<br>
guess that the impact will be greater, but its character may change.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It's one thing to talk about the future of the West, about the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technologies and what opportunities they will bring to those of us wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and fortunate enough to be participating on this mailing list.  But let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us not forget that &quot;most people&quot; are unlike us.  It's going to be a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer road for them to share in the bountiful future we hope to see.
</em><br>
<p>Getting back to the idea of a guaranteed income--it's possible that those 
<br>
people who are unlike us might be able to handle the social change more 
<br>
readily than Western middle class people. I'm not suggesting that I know 
<br>
one way or the other, but it's something interesting to think about.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was referring to the population of the world, incidentally, when I 
<br>
spoke of a guaranteed income. It seems as though a technology which made it 
<br>
feasible to grant a guaranteed income to everyone in Europe at no expense 
<br>
to anyone would also be capable of doing the same for the population of the 
<br>
whole world.
