<p>
Some salient ideas I tend to agree with and find relevant, from
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/idm/personen/mhoffman/papers/abduction-logic.html">http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/idm/personen/mhoffman/papers/abduction-logic.html</a>
<br>
<p>(2) Sign-mediated cognition implies that every set of data given as the
<br>
starting point of an abductive inference is never given &quot;purely&quot;, but
<br>
always determined by modes of perception, by perspectives, background
<br>
theories, etc. Every cognition is embedded within a set of contexts. I use
<br>
the term &quot;context&quot; in Gregory Bateson’s sense. Bateson gives the example of
<br>
the co-evolution of horse and savanna: The evolution of the horses is
<br>
determined by the savanna in which they graze as well as the evolution of
<br>
the savanna is determined by the horses (Bateson, 1972:155).  Thus there
<br>
exists one context of mutual dependence between both. In order to define
<br>
the meaning of &quot;context&quot; more precisely, I would say that a &quot;context&quot; is a
<br>
relation of mutual dependence of the habits of several
<br>
entities. Context is not &quot;environment&quot; as a set of certain things
<br>
&quot;outside&quot;, but a specific relation between habits of interacting entities.
<br>
In contrast to the term context I define &quot;situation&quot; as a temporally and
<br>
spatially determined set of entities regardless of possible relations
<br>
between them. While a situation is a concrete and particular &quot;event&quot;, a
<br>
context is general in the same way as habits as forms of acting and
<br>
perceiving are general. 
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
(3) In contrast to Platonic &quot;ideas&quot;, it is important to note: first, that
<br>
contexts are not &quot;eternal&quot; but part of a process of evolution and, second,
<br>
that these general elements are not disjoined from the &quot;facts&quot; or
<br>
particular &quot;states of affairs&quot; which they determine. For Peirce, there
<br>
exists a mutual determination between the general and the particular and a
<br>
&quot;co-evolution&quot; of both. 
<br>
<p>(4) If according to point (2) every cognition is mediated by some general
<br>
elements, then the same must be assumed for so-called &quot;surprising facts&quot;,
<br>
at least in so far as they are perceivable. Their surprising character
<br>
exists only with respect to certain expectations under certain
<br>
circumstances (cf. :CP 2.776; :CP 6.469). Insofar as they are perceived,
<br>
the surprising facts are facts of mediated perception, while in their
<br>
genuine surprising character they are immediately experienced as &quot;brute
<br>
facts&quot; or pure &quot;secondness&quot;, as Peirce says. In order to transform the
<br>
psychological notion of &quot;surprise&quot; into a more general form, one could say
<br>
that a &quot;surprising fact&quot; is a fact which is not covered by certain
<br>
expectations generated by certain contexts of belief, although the fact is
<br>
such that it ought in some way to be part of the intended applications of
<br>
those contexts of belief. 
<br>
[...]
<br>
<p>(7) A central condition for taking new perspectives is activity. It is a
<br>
simple fact of perception theory that for a child it is hardly possible to
<br>
learn to see if the head cannot be turned and the whole body moved. 
<br>
[...]
<br>
<p>(8) For Peirce, the necessity of &quot;instincts&quot; results from his belief that
<br>
it is impossible to explain the
<br>
rate of scientific progress and its success by chance alone: &quot;there are
<br>
myriads of false hypotheses to
<br>
account for any given phenomenon, against one sole true one&quot; (Peirce,
<br>
1905b:CP 5.431). 
<br>
<p>===============
<br>
<p>This can be linked to the J. Gibsonian notion of affordances in the
<br>
environment.
