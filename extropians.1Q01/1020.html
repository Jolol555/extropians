<p>
One thing I learned in reading a couple of the papers at
<br>
<a href="http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pubs-pwp.html">http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/pubs-pwp.html</a> is that futures markets
<br>
by themselves will probably not lead to significantly lower energy prices.
<br>
<p>The future market price is basically an estimate of what the average spot
<br>
price will be over the contract period.  Both buyer and seller have to
<br>
agree on the price to which they will be locked in, and they will try
<br>
to negotiate the best deal possible.  Ultimately it will come down to
<br>
their guesses at what average prices are going to be.
<br>
<p>As it happens, the high prices we have seen in the past year were not
<br>
anticipated by anyone.  So futures contracts negotiated a year ago would
<br>
in fact have saved money for the utility companies who are buying power.
<br>
<p>However, now that we have seen the high prices, futures contract prices
<br>
are going up.  No seller wants to get locked into $50/MWh if he is going
<br>
to be making $500/MWh on the spot market.  So any futures contracts
<br>
entered today are going to be at premium prices.
<br>
<p>What will happen next summer?  The spot market could shoot up as it did
<br>
last year, so that spot prices are higher than the long term futures
<br>
contract prices.  Or we could have an economic slowdown and some cooler
<br>
weather, in which case the utilities would be locked into paying much
<br>
more than the spot price.
<br>
<p>There's no way to predict.  By locking in the price today, the utilities
<br>
insulate themselves from the risk of higher prices, at the cost of
<br>
being unable to take advantage if prices drop back to more historically
<br>
normal ranges.
<br>
<p>In general, the market makes the best guess possible about the future.
<br>
It may be wrong either way, but on the average it will be as likely to be
<br>
wrong one way as the other.  This means that using futures contracts will
<br>
lead to prices that are, on the average, the same as spot market prices.
<br>
It does not save money.
<br>
<p>Now, there are some second-order effects which can lead to savings under
<br>
futures contracts.  They take away some of the strategies and tricks which
<br>
power suppliers can use to exercise &quot;market power&quot; and get higher than
<br>
competitive prices.  For example, suppliers are accused of holding plants
<br>
offline, falsely claiming they are under maintenance, and then when the
<br>
prices have risen high enough that day suddenly the plants are turned on.
<br>
<p>This kind of &quot;gaming&quot; of the system appears to be happening in some cases,
<br>
and it can only work in the short term markets.  Using futures markets
<br>
would eliminate some of these uncompetitive strategies and might lower
<br>
prices somewhat, depending on the extent to which high prices are due
<br>
to these kinds of tricks.  It's not clear though how much of an effect
<br>
this would have.
<br>
