<p>If we compare two years [1975 and 1991], some/most of the people who were
<br>
poor in the
<br>
first year will not be the same people who are poor in the later year.
<br>
Some highlights of these last three tables: The biggest is the number
<br>
of people who start in the bottom quintile and work their way out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In table 5, over 85% of the poorest quintile in 1979 were no longer in
<br>
that quintile in 1988.  In table 6, the number is almost 95% for the
<br>
longer period of 1975 to 1991.  The vast majority of the people poor
<br>
in year x are not going to be poor in the near future.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><p><p>(If you are
<br>
thinking this is only a long-run phenomena, consider this: according
<br>
to the Census Bureau, between 1984 and 1985, 18.2% of families in the
<br>
lowest quintile had moved up one or more quintiles.  For 1985-86, the
<br>
number is 18.4% and it's 17.0% for 1987-88.  So there are steady
<br>
year-by-year gains.) Even for the rich, there's no guarantees.
<br>
Granted, if you started the period rich, you were more likely to stay
<br>
in your quintile than were the poor, but even there the odds were
<br>
roughly 50/50.  Over 1/3 of the top 20% of income earners in 1975 were
<br>
no longer in the top quintile by 1991, and the numbers are comparable
<br>
for the 1979-88 data.
<br>
<p>Table 7 is fascinating as well.  This table shows the average income
<br>
gains of the specific households that were tracked over the 16 year
<br>
period.  The dollars are all converted to 1997 dollars to take out the
<br>
effects of inflation.  Families who were in 1975 in the bottom 20% had
<br>
an average income increase of almost $28,000 by 1991, while the folks
<br>
in the top 20% only gained an average of $4,354.  So the rich did get
<br>
richer over this period, but the poor's income grew substantially more
<br>
than that of the rich!  That is, the rich got richer but the poor got
<br>
even richer, not just in percentage terms but in absolute terms.
<br>
Again, this data is tracking specific families.
<br>
<p>One footnote to all of this: among those who began in the lowest
<br>
quintile in 1975, 98% had higher incomes (in real terms) over the
<br>
course of the next 16 years, even if not all of them got out of the
<br>
lowest quintile.  Two-thirds of those who were in the lowest quintile
<br>
in 1975 had higher incomes in 1991 than the middle quintile had in
<br>
1975.  You need to remember that as the economy grows, the range of
<br>
the quintiles grows as well, so even those who remain in each quintile
<br>
are going better in absolute terms.
<br>
<p>It also seems appropriate to mention that all of these gains by the
<br>
poor were during the so-called Decade of Greed, pillioried by those on
<br>
the left for its supposed cold-heartedness and mistreatment of the
<br>
poor.  You can make your own call on that claim.
<br>
<p>A good deal of this is explained by demographic factors.  For example,
<br>
the bottom quintile tends to be disproportionately young people and as
<br>
they age, they move up the ladder.  Even if that explains a good deal
<br>
of what we see here, so what?  It still contradicts the usual
<br>
understanding of the data.  The real policy question here is income
<br>
mobility.  How easy is it for folks who start poor to move their way
<br>
up?  The answer to that is &quot;pretty easy.&quot;  That paints a far different
<br>
picture of how the poor are doing over time than the static and
<br>
misleading idea that the poor are getting poorer that is taken from
<br>
year-to-year comparisons of the quintiles.
