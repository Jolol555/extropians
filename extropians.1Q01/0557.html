<em>&gt; &gt; Unlike Venus, Mars doesn't have a toxic atmosphere and regular temperatures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; above 100 centigrade.  Perhaps Venus is a better terraforming target, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the temperature, because it has an existing thick atmosphere of chemicals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to convert into an approximation of Earth atmosphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is getting rid of all the stored heat as well as the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the rotation is very slow. Mars is likely easier to terraform, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least set upp ecopoiesis - why create *another* Earth when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could try for something new instead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The heat is partially a result of the greenhouse effect of the Venusian atmosphere,
<br>
not to mention the fact that it's closer to the furnace of the Sun.  Changing the
<br>
content of the atmospher ecould be started by tailored microbes that can live in
<br>
the Venusian environment and feed on its complete atmosphere or other microbes that
<br>
could.
<br>
<p>When you say &quot;new&quot; that brings to mind various possibilities.  For example, unless
<br>
Mars has bacteria in some form or another, or some other complex system that is at
<br>
least semi-organic, then it is not a bad idea to use Earth life to seed Mar life.
<br>
If Mars already had a developing ecosystem, then there would be less reason to
<br>
introduce something else.
<br>
<p>Say that one day Mars has been given a thin atmosphere, maybe it would be like
<br>
living a couple miles above the Earth's surface.  If the atmosphere trapped enough
<br>
heat then there could be liquid water, at which point a major criterion of life is
<br>
established.
<br>
<p>So, Mars might not have much of an atmosphere, so some kind of mechanism would have
<br>
to grind the rocks into air.  There are probably at lesat some small deposits of
<br>
various minerals around Mars.  We were speaking about globes of Mars, how much and
<br>
what can we say about what mineral resources might exist on Mars?
<br>
<p>Does Mars have a liquid metal core?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  On Mars, on the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hand, it would be easier to have companion human settlements to large scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environmental engineering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True. The problem is that bootstrapping the atmosphere and ecosystem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a rather tricky coupled problem - ideally you want both to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other get more dense, but getting that initial push out from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current cold/dry metastable state into the hypothetically possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;warm/wet&quot; (still rather cold and dry by Earth standards). Solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mirrors might help with that initial push, but I guess a widespread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nano-infrastructure on the surface is needed to really succeed in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short (decades-centuries) time span.

<p>Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote about Mars.
<br>
<p>Here's something to consider about Mars, rendez-vous something with a big water
<br>
comet and push it thus that it orbit in ten or fifteen or more years coincides with
<br>
Mars, that it is not a &quot;soft landing&quot; of off-planet resources on Mars, but rather a
<br>
&quot;controlled landing&quot;.
