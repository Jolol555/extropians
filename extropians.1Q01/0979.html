<p><em>&gt;Marlow's Paradox:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;“We cannot entrust our fate to machines without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emotions, for they have no compassion; we cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entrust our fate to machines with emotions, for they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are unpredictable.” 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Basically, we can't trust machines.
</em><br>
<p>And what's different about people?  We have checks 
<br>
and balances in goverment, contracts and arbiters in
<br>
business, credit checks and gossip in personal life, all
<br>
for good reason.
