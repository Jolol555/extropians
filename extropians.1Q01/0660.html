In the Fish in Space thread, Ross, Spike, Anders, et al have been
<br>
discussing bases on the nearby planets.

</em><br>
<p>If Mercury had been tidelocked, with one side continuosly facing the sun,
<br>
then Ross's 'constant dawn' would have existed in a ring around the planet.
<br>
&nbsp;But though it is not tide locked, all is not lost.  The same basing
<br>
opportunity still exists, but now it's limited to an area around the poles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Nasa's &quot;Welcome to the Planets&quot; page on Mercury,
</em><br>
<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/welcome/mercury.htm">http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/welcome/mercury.htm</a> , I found the following:
<br>
<p>Obliquity (tilt of axis in degrees)..................0
<br>
Orbit inclination (degrees)..........................7
<br>
Orbit eccentricity (deviation from circular).........0.206
<br>
<p>Mean surface temperature (K).........................452
<br>
Maximum surface temperature (K)......................700
<br>
Minimum surface temperature (K)......................100
<br>
<p>Note that the tilt of the axis is zero degrees. (I interpret this to mean
<br>
that the axis is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit.  Is that right?)
<br>
This would mean that the incident angle of sunlight is constant at any
<br>
given lattitude.  Logically, the temperature extremes shown above should be
<br>
moderated as one moves toward the poles.
<br>
<p>At <a href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html</a>, I found the
<br>
following comment:
<br>
&quot;Amazingly, radar observations of Mercury's north pole (a region not mapped
<br>
by Mariner 10)
<br>
show evidence of water ice in the protected shadows of some craters.&quot;
<br>
Water is good.
<br>
<p>Regarding Venus, at 
<br>
<a href="http://nova.stanford.edu/projects/mgs/images/t3213.gif">http://nova.stanford.edu/projects/mgs/images/t3213.gif</a> 
<br>
and
<br>
<a href="http://nova.stanford.edu/projects/mgs/images/p3213.gif">http://nova.stanford.edu/projects/mgs/images/p3213.gif</a>
<br>
<p>I found temperature and pressure profiles of the Venusian atmosphere.
<br>
Check out the graphs.  
<br>
<p>Right around 50 km altitude, temperature and pressure are around 300K and 1
<br>
atm, perfect for human life.  Since the atmosphere is 96% CO2, with a
<br>
density of 44 gms/mole, an 80/20 N2/O2 atmosphere, at a density of  28.8
<br>
gms/mole would be bouyant.  You can see where I'm going with this.  No need
<br>
to put the base on the surface.  Tough sledding there.  Temperature and
<br>
pressure way high.  But a dirigible or geodesic sphere works fine, with the
<br>
entire interior space habitable.
<br>
<p>The atmosphere is clear below the sulphuric acid haze which, coincidently,
<br>
starts at around 50 km altitude.  (I haven't found any information about
<br>
how much visible light, if any, penetrates to, or originates in, the clear
<br>
region below the sulphuric acid haze, which tops out at 65 km.  Might be
<br>
pretty dark.  Anyone know the absorbtion characteristics of H2SO4?)  Winds
<br>
at the top of the atmosphere are pretty fierce, 350 km/hr, but below the
<br>
clouds they're mild.
<br>
<p>Speaking of the sulphuric acid, it's sounds pretty nasty, but,...perhaps
<br>
it's an opportunity in disguise.  Seems like it would be a high energy
<br>
compound pumped up by the solar radiation.  Just as the ocean here on earth
<br>
is a giant solar pond, with vast quantities of energy stored in the thermal
<br>
gradient, I would guess that the sulphuric-acid-above/carbon-dioxide-below
<br>
stratification of the Venusian atmosphere might manifest a similar energy
<br>
storage phenomenon with the energy stored in chemical, rather than thermal,
<br>
form.  Any chemists want to comment on the potential for energy extraction
<br>
using sulphuric acid and carbon dioxide?  In any event, it seems there are
<br>
abundant supplies of C, H, O, and S.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps you could actually have a base on the surface.  With a floating
<br>
component tethered to it, you could extract energy from the thermal gradient.
<br>
<p>Well, that's enough for now.  
<br>
<p>As always,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
