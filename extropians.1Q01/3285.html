<br>
Topology and neurology
<br>
<p>Your neurologist would love to flatten your brain. Not physically, you will
<br>
be glad to know, but mathematically. For, just as the exploration of the
<br>
earth¹s surface (a sphere, more or less) required the creation of
<br>
appropriate flat maps, so, too, does the exploration of the surface of the
<br>
brain.
<br>
<p>It is not that hard to convert a sphere into a plane, provided that you are
<br>
clear about the compromises you are prepared to make. The Mercator
<br>
projection, for example, preserves shapes and angular relationships at the
<br>
expense of areas‹so that the polar regions look far too large in relation to
<br>
the equatorial ones. Flattening out the convoluted surface of the brain
<br>
requires more compromises than that. But Monica Hurdal of Florida State
<br>
University thinks that she has made them in an acceptable way. At the recent
<br>
joint annual meetings of the American Mathematical Society and the
<br>
Mathematical Association of America in New Orleans, she presented her work
<br>
on ³quasi-conformal maps of the human brain from circle packings².
<br>
<p>Brains do most of their information-processing on the surface‹or cortex, as
<br>
it is known neurologically. So species that, in the course of evolution,
<br>
have come to need more brain-power, have developed brains with creased,
<br>
convoluted cortexes that pack more surface area into the same volume of
<br>
skull. This makes it hard for researchers to see exactly which parts of the
<br>
cortex are doing what, and how they are related to one another. So, although
<br>
it is possible to put somebody into a brain scanner, set them a task, and
<br>
see which bits of their cortex light up with activity, areas that look
<br>
adjacent in an image produced by the scanner may, if they have a deep fold
<br>
between them, actually be a long way apart.
<br>
<p>That is where a map‹a flattened version of the brain showing exactly where
<br>
on its surface the activity is taking place‹would come in handy. It would,
<br>
for preference, be a projection that preserves shapes, like Mercator¹s. And
<br>
this is indeed possible, according to Dr Hurdal, using a law of geometry
<br>
known as the Riemann mapping theorem that was first enunciated in 1854.
<br>
<p>This theorem says that every continuous surface can be turned into a special
<br>
kind of flat map, called a conformal map. Such a map means that if you have
<br>
two angles on the original surface, and one is twice as large as the other,
<br>
the first angle will remain twice as large as the second even if the actual
<br>
number of degrees in each angle changes. This is not quite as good as
<br>
keeping every angle the same, as with Mercator¹s projection, but it is good
<br>
enough for neurologists who want to steer between bits of the cortex.
<br>
<p>To prove her point, Dr Hurdal showed her audience a map of part of the
<br>
brain, called the cerebellum, of a hapless student who had been induced to
<br>
undergo no fewer than 27 brain scans. The upshot of this scanning was a
<br>
high-quality three-dimensional image, to a precision of one millimetre in
<br>
each direction. This level of precision allowed her to distinguish precisely
<br>
between the ³white² matter of the brain¹s interior, and the ³grey² matter of
<br>
its cortex. The result was a network of 50,000 cortical points, each
<br>
connected to its nearest neighbours by a line. Dr Hurdal thus ended up with
<br>
a landscape, still convoluted, of triangles.
<br>
<p>The hard part was flattening this network of triangles. But an older
<br>
theorem, going back to the ancient Greeks, states that you can always draw
<br>
three circles around the corners of a triangle so that each one just touches
<br>
the other two. Since any two of these circles will also belong to a
<br>
neighbouring triangle, if you have thousands of triangles in a flat plane,
<br>
you can have a perfect packing of that plane by thousands of circles.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the triangles that represent the surface of a brain are not
<br>
in a flat plane, so the touching circles drawn in each of them will stick
<br>
out. But there will still, according to the Riemann theorem, be a unique way
<br>
to move all the points until they settle down with the circles into a
<br>
well-packed plane. The result is, to a good approximation, a conformal map.
<br>
<p>Navigation, however, also requires a reference grid. On the earth¹s surface,
<br>
this is derived from two fixed points (the poles) and a line (the equator).
<br>
In the cerebellum, the equivalents of these have to be bits of anatomy that
<br>
can be recognised in everybody¹s version of the structure. Fortunately,
<br>
although much about the cerebellum is mysterious, enough is known for such
<br>
features to have been identified.
<br>
<p>Once brain-navigation becomes routine (with luck, without the need for 27
<br>
separate scans), it will be possible to track changes in a brain over time.
<br>
It will also be possible to compare the brain maps of individuals, even if
<br>
everyone¹s cortex is folded slightly differently. And that should lead to
<br>
some interesting voyages of neural discovery indeed.
