<em>&gt; Hypacia the former head of the great library of Alexandria could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably easily hold her own with both Socrates and Descartes, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a knockout to boot.
</em><br>
<p>Both Socrates and Descartes would perhaps prefer Hypacia to hold her own,
<br>
since they had better things to think about than holding her own. ô¿ô
<br>
I don't suppose Hypacia was asked to hold her own hemlock.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Buddha would be very pleased with Charlotte Joko Beck of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; San Diego Zen center.
</em><br>
<p>I've heard that Buddha originally excluded females from his meditation
<br>
camps, and that he predicted the inclusion of females would corrupt his
<br>
teaching and shorten the life of his community. He relented, and allowed
<br>
females to take sannyas only after his sister begged him to become a
<br>
devotee.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hey, Descarte walks into a bar and the bartender asks him &quot;What'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have bub&quot; and Descarte says &quot; I don't know&quot; and disappears.....
</em><br>
<p>Reminds me of a Darwin quote:
<br>
&quot;We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that
<br>
man with all his noble qualities, still bears in his bodily
<br>
frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;-- Charles Darwin

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind,
<br>
free will
