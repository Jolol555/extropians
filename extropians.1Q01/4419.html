<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Government taking away civilian guns....
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's the problem here? I've been told any number of times
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by folks on the Extropian list that the federal government is too
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;large to get away with crimes. For example, if the Navy were to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shoot down a jet and dozens of people saw it, to cover it up would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be too difficult because too many people would have to keep quite.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, a small group would have an easier time getting away.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergo, the larger the institution the less corrupt it is -- power
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stops corruption and absolute power stops corruption absolutely.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Govt's enormous size and power, rather than being the most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;effective means of intimidation, is key to stopping Govt crime,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus the larger the Govt gets, the less corrupt it can be.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's the problem with taking guns from the more corrupt
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(the small) and giving them to an entity that's too large to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;commit and get away with serious crime? Let's be consistent!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, look at what anti-gun-control Charlton Heston says:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;  Let me back up.  About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Association, which protects the right to keep and bear arms.  I ran for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I serve as a moving target for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the media ...
</em><br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: When I implied the media was out to get me for believing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;what Flight-800 witnesses told me they saw (and major media
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;had multiple slanderous hits on me), this was identified as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a sign that I have a brain malfunction called &quot;paranoia&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(what witnesses reported: <a href="http://Flight800.org/eye.html">http://Flight800.org/eye.html</a> and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if you believe those witnesses, you have a brain malfunction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;because the Navy, CIA, FBI, and NTSB said they're all wrong).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So now here's Hestin implying the media is out to get him,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;implying that this large entity called &quot;the media&quot; acts in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a unified way, with one mind, as if it was a conspiracy, yet
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;suddenly this is apparently not a sign of brain impairment.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd say the difference is that it needs to be &quot;paranoid&quot; if
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the issue involves the deaths of 230 people because we have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to make sure that if the Govt did it, they don't get caught.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows who the Big Boy on the block is, the Govt, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone is eager to be on Big Boy's good side, and a natural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;way to do that is to attack those pointing fingers at Biggie.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I think Heston is not paranoid and that giving all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;our guns to the Govt would be a great mistake. But were I too
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;apply the logical rules defined by most who believe the CIA and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;disbelieve those who saw the Flight 800 crash, to be consistent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd have to say Heston is paranoid and the Govt is uncorruptable,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;since with so many people in it, it could not get away with crime.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who better to have all the guns than the most trustworthy entity?
