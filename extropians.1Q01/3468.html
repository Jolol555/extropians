<br>
<p>Relax, people!  There's no need for all this speculating.
<br>
<p>Natasha is not dropping out of Transhumanist Art or Extropianism. 
<br>
She is  busy with several documentaries, one or two films, several 
<br>
magazine interviews, and has been invited to speak in NY at a very 
<br>
impressive event which is also making a documentary.
<br>
<p>She is merely choosing to not wade through this list's voluminous 
<br>
ramblings ever day.  Her busy schedule obviously makes it 
<br>
increasingly difficult to keep up with some of the 
<br>
less-than-brilliant topics we have been seeing lately.  This should 
<br>
not be seen as an insult to or rejection of the list.  It is simply a 
<br>
matter of diminishing returns.  List quality has gone way down while 
<br>
the time required to read the list has gone way up.  Natasha is doing 
<br>
important work and is getting busier all the time.  These two vectors 
<br>
simply diverge.  Many old-timers have come and gone from the list 
<br>
because of demands of their outside projects.
<br>
<p>We will continue to see Natasha in The Real World(TM) getting things 
<br>
done.  I think it is counter-productive to try to place &quot;blame&quot; for 
<br>
the departure to a single cause or to read too much into it.  She 
<br>
simply has to make choices between all her various activities.  Given 
<br>
all the interesting things she is doing, this list simply doesn't 
<br>
make the cut.  I certainly would not advise her to cancel any of her 
<br>
great projects so that she could stay at home to read more of our 
<br>
ramblings.  We will probably see her back on this list from time to 
<br>
time, whenever her schedule relaxes and the list quality improves.
<br>
<p>The list has often goes through cycles of brilliance and boringness. 
<br>
People's lives also go through cycles of productivity and relaxation. 
<br>
Such cycles are normal, and we will see varying periods of overlap 
<br>
over time.  We can't insist that every high-profile member remain 
<br>
constantly active at all times just for our benefit.  Most 
<br>
high-profile members get pulled away on projects that become too 
<br>
time-consuming and important to allow continued participation in this 
<br>
particular forum.  This is a good thing.  It would be sad if nobody 
<br>
had any other priorities except posting to this list.
