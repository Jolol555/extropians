<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt;From a strictly practical standpoint, I don't think their stance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; if any, will be significant because they don't comprise a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; significant portion of the &quot;tech pool&quot; and lack the influence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; affect development and applications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Will that situation last? Remember that educations levels in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are rising fast, and you will find quite a few moslems in academia in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the West too (when digging up the URL I posted earlier in this thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I had problems filtering out all research papers written by somebody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with 'Islam' in their name). Also, being technologically leading is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not the only way of being influential in world politics and culture;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  oil, being 25% of the population and having a growing cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  identity can definitely be significant. If 25% of the customers want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  something, there will be a big market of developing it.
</em><br>
<p>I hope you're right, Anders, but I'm not at all sure you are.  The question 
<br>
may be whether simply increasing the speed and volume of information flow 
<br>
will have a positive influence.  I think the answer may well be a clear &quot;no&quot; 
<br>
to that question.  The CONTENT of the information flow is also very 
<br>
important.  My digital television cable set-up has dozens and dozens of 
<br>
channels.  On any given Sunday, those channels are choked with religious 
<br>
programming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Violent opposition, on the other hand, could have significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Why? Islam is not more likely to be dangerously violent than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Christianity, and beside some fundie-bashing on this list I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  think many of us consider the Church to be a major factor in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  influencing the future of humanity?
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid the viewpoint you express may be heavily influenced by the fact 
<br>
that you live in what is almost surely the most secular culture on Earth, 
<br>
21st century Scandinavia.  Spend some time in Latin America or anywhere in 
<br>
the swath of the planet dominated by Islam, and see if you still hold the 
<br>
opinion that religion won't be an important influence on humanity's future.  
<br>
While I hate to seem the pessimist, the truth is that the fraction of 
<br>
humanity that has really internalized the cultural breakthroughs of the 
<br>
Enlightenment is very, very small.  It is a testimony to the efficacy of our 
<br>
world-view that we have the influence that we do - in great disproportion to 
<br>
our actual numbers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  Let's keep to the subject: how does Islamic religion and culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  interpret and deal with transhumanist issues? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and as I just posted a moment ago, it would be VERY interesting to talk 
<br>
to a scholar with deep knowledge of the transformation of Islamic culture 
<br>
from one that encouraged innovation in mathematics and technology to one that 
<br>
is deeply inimical to innovation and creative thought.  Islam may well need 
<br>
to undergo an analog of the Reformation before the Islamic world can embrace 
<br>
the lessons of the Enlightenment.  Alas, I feel that someone like Salmon 
<br>
Rushdie would be pessimistic about the prospects for such a development.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  I think one factor that also should be studied here is the view of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  relationship of the individual to society and the world at large; this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is very culturally dependent, and the Enlightenment individualism we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are grounded in here on this list is very different from what you find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in other cultures. This could actually turn out to be one of the major
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  stumbling blocks for spreading transhumanist ideas.
</em><br>
<p>Very much agreed on this point.
