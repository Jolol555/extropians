<p>HOW TO FLY A SPACECRAFT: ON-LINE TUTORIAL AVAILABLE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Basics of Space Flight,&quot; a popular, longtime 
<br>
Internet offering that teaches the essentials of operating 
<br>
interplanetary spacecraft missions, has been updated and is 
<br>
now available, courtesy of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
<br>
Pasadena, Calif., at  <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/basics">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/basics</a> . 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-teaching guide, created by JPL spacecraft 
<br>
operations engineer David Doody, was originally created almost 
<br>
a decade ago to help JPL spacecraft operators understand the 
<br>
concepts of and relationships between various specialized 
<br>
elements of a space mission, such as spacecraft engineering, 
<br>
mission design, launch and telecommunications.  Since then, 
<br>
&quot;Basics of Space Flight&quot; has engendered broad appeal inside 
<br>
and outside of NASA for aerospace professionals and armchair 
<br>
space explorers alike. It also enjoys growing popularity among 
<br>
high school and college students and faculty. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our purpose was to cover the broad range of all subject 
<br>
matter that plays into robotic spaceflight,&quot; said Doody.  &quot;It 
<br>
covers broadly, but not deeply, all the elements of a robotic 
<br>
space mission.  Any one of the topics we touch on could 
<br>
involve a lifetime of specialization.&quot;  Doody said he drew 
<br>
upon contributions from experts in different fields at JPL and 
<br>
numerous other institutions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The module, unavailable in printed form, is intended to 
<br>
be used online via the World Wide Web.  Interactive quizzes 
<br>
provide users with a measurement of their progress.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Basics of Spaceflight&quot; was created by Doody for JPL's 
<br>
Telecommunications and Mission Operations Directorate under 
<br>
NASA's Office of Space Science.  JPL is a division of the 
<br>
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
