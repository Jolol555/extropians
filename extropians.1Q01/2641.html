<p><em>&gt; Is there a good reason you left out induction?
</em><br>
<p>No, just forgot about it. Replace 'deduction' with 'deduction and
<br>
induction' in the text, and it still makes sense.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What about the space of code relevant for AI? Most likely it is nicer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than the general case, so there are some seed programs that are on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; average better than others. But we should remember that this space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still contains Gödel-undecidable stuff, so it is by no means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simple. The issue here is whether even the most optimal seed program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; converges towards a optimum fast enough to be interesting. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complicate things, programs can increase the dimensionality of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; search space by becoming more complex, possibly enabling higher values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of V(P) but also making the search problem exponentially harder. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is a kind of limit here, where systems can quickly improve their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; value in the first steps, but then rapidly get a search space that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; getting more and more unmanageable. I guess the &quot;intelligence&quot; of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a system would behave like the logarithm of time or worse - definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not exponential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;the following is sloppy but may be worth some thought&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Godel undeciability is probably not terribly relevant given an ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make inductive leaps and tests them and enough loosness in the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to allow workable solutions to be discovered and deployed that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully mathematically rigourous. 
</em><br>
<p>Sure. But the existence of Godel nastiness in the workspace imples
<br>
that other nastiness is also likely, like statements that look very
<br>
likely but actually fail very rarely and unpredictably. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If the searching mechanisms are capable of expanding the paralleism of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the searching and of combining together branches in ways difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express mathematically (rather slooppy like within the brain) I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the above arguments are unnecessarily restrictive.  
</em><br>
<p>Hmm? Massive parallelism doesn't solve the problem of combinatorial
<br>
explosions, they just delay them a little bit. And combining together
<br>
branches in complex ways is expensive, and combining them in a sloppy
<br>
analogous fashion only works as long as the environment you are
<br>
working in has useful regularities. If the space of AI programs has
<br>
some simple regularity you can discover, then it is possible to use
<br>
this to make progress more efficient. But if it doesn't have this
<br>
regular structure, then analogies will not be efficient. I believe,
<br>
given the kind of complexities a space of programs entails, that it is
<br>
much more likely that this holds for the AI problem.  
<br>
<p>It is a bit like Chaitins proof that most computer programs are not
<br>
compressible and essentially random; if you choose a program at random
<br>
it will likely be messy and the effort to understand it equal to the
<br>
number of bits in the program. When we program we build stuff from
<br>
modules, using small pieces of more irreducible code to build larger
<br>
systems. That is a nice subspace of the program space, but we have no
<br>
evidence AI is inside it, especially not the road towards greater and
<br>
greater AI.
<br>
<p>Analogies work well for us humans because we usually live in the same
<br>
environment, which does have a fairly regular structure. If you move
<br>
into a mathematical environment analogies become noticeably less
<br>
efficient, at least in some mathematical branches.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I would recommend Christoph Adami's _Introduction to Artificial Life_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sprinmger, New York 1998 for a discussion of environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information gathering in evolving programs (based on his papers on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this; see <a href="http://www.krl.caltech.edu/~adami/cas.html">http://www.krl.caltech.edu/~adami/cas.html</a>).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would not say it is what you have shown.  It is what you have argued. 
</em><br>
<p>Huh? What I meant was that the book to a large extent is based on his
<br>
papers. He has some newer results out now, including a nice Nature
<br>
paper.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To sum up, I doubt Colossus, even given its cameras and missiles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have been able to bootstrap itself very fast. It seems it had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been given a very simple value function, and that would likely lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a very slow evolution. To get a real AI bootstrap we probably need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; connect it a lot with reality, and reality is unfortunately rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slow even when it is Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another possibility is an ALife micro-world operating at higher speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but with less driving complexity.
</em><br>
<p>But then you will have to supply a suitable ALife microworld, one that
<br>
has enough complexity and emergence to really supply anything to the
<br>
emerging AI. Compare the real world to Game of Life - in the real
<br>
world new layers of complexity emerge from lower layers many times
<br>
(quantum fields -&gt; quarks -&gt; hadrons -&gt; atoms -&gt; molecules -&gt;
<br>
chemistry -&gt; biology -&gt; ecology and so on), while in Game of Life we
<br>
apparently get just one layer of emergence (gliders and similar
<br>
patterns) but no further layers.
