<p><em>&gt; I'm not offering an opinion: I'm looking for them -- opinions from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslims about the sort of issues that interest this mailing list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So far, my initial web searches for Islamic attitudes to cloning, genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering, uploading, immortalism, transhumanism, AI, nanotech, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the singularity on have not been incredibly productive. Do any of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys have any pointers to Islamic jurisprudence concerning high-tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developments, or to Moslem sites that discuss the singularity?
</em><br>
<p>I found this: <a href="http://home.att.net/~nungan/sufiway/08bio.htm">http://home.att.net/~nungan/sufiway/08bio.htm</a> I don't
<br>
know if it is authoritative, but it seems to be fairly well
<br>
reasoned. It seems to essentially say that the methods are not in
<br>
themselves ethical or unethical, but applications may be.
<br>
<p>My guess (it was a long time since I read Islamic theology - yes, I
<br>
actually spent a little while reading up on it a few years back) is
<br>
that Islam is not against useful applications from above technologies,
<br>
but that changing the nature of humanity or creating something
<br>
&quot;better&quot; is regarded out of bounds (here Islam appears to be more
<br>
clear on things than Christianity). In the above URL there is a quote
<br>
from the Quran saying that if you create a species of being, you are
<br>
responsible for the consequences of its actions to the end of time - a
<br>
hefty responsibility, but not an outright ban on AI (Eliezer better go
<br>
on a hajj just in case :-).
<br>
<p>Unlike Christianity which seems to have a rather directional view of
<br>
history with a singularity at the end, Islam seems to be more directed
<br>
towards an eternity-perspective, giving me a feeling that to many
<br>
people from Islamic cultures the singularity would look much more
<br>
alien than to us.
<br>
<p>Of course, there will always be people that take the Quran more or
<br>
less seriously. I guess there are many liberal moslems that will have
<br>
their own interpretations of things, coming up with as many positive
<br>
and negative responses to transhumanism as liberal christians and
<br>
humanists do. We might even be surprised by the fundamentalists, since
<br>
they are by no means total luddites and might very well use advanced
<br>
technology in the service of Allah.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note: this is NOT an invitation for an anti-moslem rant. I'm genuinely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to get my head around what Moslems think about the way things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to develop in the next 50 years, technologically speaking ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think figuring out what 25% of the human population think about where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're going is important.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. Quite often the debate on this list become very much centered
<br>
on beliefs and models that are particular to the Western tradition. It
<br>
is interesting to note how many parents in Asia for example regard
<br>
genetic modifications of their children much more ethically acceptable
<br>
than western parents, something that suggest we should really look
<br>
into the possibilities of transhumanist interpretations from other
<br>
cultures.
