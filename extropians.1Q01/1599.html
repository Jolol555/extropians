</em><br>
<p>Thanks, I'll try to catch this.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; No system being sold runs at anything near these numbers. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; recently got to play with OC-768 which is a mere 40 GBS. The big
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;....which runs over a single wavelength of light among many many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a single fiber. 
</em><br>
<p>Known as a Lambda, I do this for a living....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;These technologies most certainly ARE commercially available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are also terabit routers available to handle the packets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Charlotte's Web, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but the industry standard is still just in the beginnings
<br>
of migration to OC-192. 
<br>
<p>Dense wavelength division multiplexing... simple.
<br>
<p>I've gotten LIGHTWAVE since issue 1.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; problem is that while 100 cables can theoretically carry the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; traffic, the reality is that connections will need to be made to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; many thousands of different points. We will need a thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;times the Internet we have today. I also stated that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;networks will need to be built to accomodate QOS which they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not now.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well this goes back to the old circuit vs. packet switching
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument. I think you just throw more bandwidth at it, and QoS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerns go away. I mean if you have a 100mbit connection to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;home, you really don't have to worry about making 64kbit phone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calls. Do you really think QoS will matter in a world like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that?
</em><br>
<p>It's more than this, we don't have 100MBS to the home, that's the
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>I don't think we'll ever have a 100MBS to the home standard, I
<br>
think we'll blow right by this. The problem is that the existing
<br>
network can't support this, and to build one today with existing
<br>
technology would run well over $1000 per port, times the 250
<br>
million ports in the 5 state region, we're talking quite a sum.
<br>
<p>But you are right, eventually you'll pay to have a high speed port
<br>
and the amount of bandwidth needed for voice service will be so
<br>
small as to be negligible.
<br>
<p>Something I've always thought interesting. As we advance to the all
<br>
optical network, we may start with a system that basically switches
<br>
individual fibers with MEMS, in effect replacing the copper with
<br>
fiber creating a mostly optical circuit switched network!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the bandwidth increases, eventually the cost of the bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to conduct a voice call will be miniscule, but we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of billions of dollars from that point. TANSTAAFL.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Exactly, it ain't cheap to get there. You might enjoy watching
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this video:

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Translation: switch to IP and fiber or die
</em><br>
<p>Thanks, got it the first time. ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The days of saying the phone companies understand voice but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't understand data are over.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;We'll see... T not looking so hot lately
</em><br>
<p>Doing better lately. We are looking at all of this, but the numbers
<br>
don't line up, mostly due to the restrictions imposed by
<br>
regulation. If they hadn't of stopped us last time this would
<br>
already be built.
