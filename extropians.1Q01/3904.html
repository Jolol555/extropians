<em>&gt;-------------------- START QUOTE [1] -------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;|Yeah, lately everytime some guy get's caught with his pant's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;|down someone bring's up this lame excuse. Humans have a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;|brain and are supposed to use it, and no silly biological fact is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;|a good excuse for a lack of character or integrity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-------------------- END QUOTE [1] ---------------------
</em><br>
<p>Although Jackson was mentioned in the article, I did not
<br>
specifically mention him in my quote. I was arguing the general
<br>
principal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If one find biological facts to not match one's meme system, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one decides to ignore the biological facts due to this, then I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call that a &quot;prejudice&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From Websters: prejudice 1) an unfavorable opinion or feeling
</em><br>
formed beforehand and without knowledge or reason.
<br>
<p>Obviously we use different definitions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It really appears as if you meant that referring to biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theories as to human male behavior, esp. Mr. Jackson's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extramatrimonical activities, was a (quote) &quot;lame excuse&quot; (end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quote).
</em><br>
<p>Not his in particular, although he is technically a member of the
<br>
set (of all male adulterers).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Or did you react on the word &quot;prejudice&quot; as too harsh a word to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;classify such an opinion?
</em><br>
<p>I though it incorrect, as it is we use different definitions
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Due to oppression of personal freedom from humans in government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion, and in other groups, the only way for humans to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;together requires that they do these meaningless rituals as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required by the Government or the Right Religion. Those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mistake empty rituals for a lack of character or integrity make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;great mistake, indeed. Most humans do not wish to fight oppression
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as ardently as Number 6 in the Prisoner TV series does.
</em><br>
<p>An interesting tactic! You're attempting to claim that &quot;the rules&quot;
<br>
don't apply in certain communities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Societies consist of individuals, and individuals have customs, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;society&quot; being an abstraction in the head of humans. Abstraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot feel, cannot have customs, etc. Individuals do. Minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point, though.
</em><br>
<p>I would argue that societies are more than an abstraction, and they
<br>
have laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You commented on the Jackson individual, so naturally I assumed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you really meant to discuss him, as a specific example of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general rule. If you did not mean that, then I will naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repent.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I claim only how it appeared to me. If I am in error, feel free to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correct me.
</em><br>
<p>It seems a simple difference, no repenting necessary. ;)
<br>
<p>I would state in concluding that being ruled by animal instincts
<br>
may be appropriate for animals, but not appropriate for humans, and
<br>
definitely not for Extropians or other Transhumans.
