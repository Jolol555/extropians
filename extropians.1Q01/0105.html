<p>I had a similar experience in the SCL6 building at Vandenburg AFB.  It
<br>
was originally designed to launch the shuttle from the west coast, but
<br>
the greens figured out that baby bunnies might be hopping by when
<br>
the thing launched and could be startled, so the entire building was
<br>
abandoned.  Five years ago, we got to launch the Lockheed Launch
<br>
Vehicle from that building.  When I first went there, my coworker took
<br>
me up to the top.  It confuses the mind to see such a huge cavernous
<br>
thing: the brain does not seem to know how to interpret what it is
<br>
seeing.  We have all seen a canyon, but outdoors there are visual
<br>
cues for distance such as haze, moisture or dust particles in the air.
<br>
Inside that building, looking down 500 feet, my mind boggled.
<br>
<p>If you have seen the a picture of the LLV inside SLC6, it is actually
<br>
funny.  It looks like a bottle rocket inside that huge place.  {8^D
