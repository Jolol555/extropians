<em>&gt; &gt; The other thing this list is good at is answering science-related

questions.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As an idea for positive PR, has anyone considered starting a website for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answering technical/science related questions, possibly aimed at
</em><br>
younguns? A
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lot of young people have questions to ask, and the people hereabouts
</em><br>
answer
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such questions in not only informative, but fairly entertaining ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Such a site could be an amalgam of website based forum &amp; mailing list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (giving people the opportunity to access it in either style), and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; involve giving answers on a strictly voluntary basis (much as happens
</em><br>
here
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; already). Think of it as a service to the community, and an excellent
</em><br>
way to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increase exposure of extropian ideas which, after all, are supposed to
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; driven by facts and reasonable predictions. The most common experience
</em><br>
here
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that people come to &gt;H ideas by processing the information available
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them in their environment, and seek out Transhumanism or Extropianism
</em><br>
after
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are already converts. So, to spread the word, we would be best
</em><br>
served
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in spreading information. And my bet is that the most likely demographic
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adopt these ideas of an amazingly changed future are young people; those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without much attachment to the way things are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why nail down the technical form of the list early?  Such a list is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea but there are already broad efforts to do this type of thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is another needed?  Does it necessarily have to do with Extropians?  Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it a front for pulling people in?  If so then it seem a bit less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honest.  Now an extropian outreach to the young (or young of mind &lt;g&gt;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems reasonable enough.

</em><br>
<p>The amount of disinformation present out there is astounding, and
<br>
intelligent people are being sucked in.  One of my colleagues, an very
<br>
intelligent and competent individual, is also extremely uncritical (he
<br>
didn't question the idea of 'psychic vibrations' at all until I challenged
<br>
him on his belief).  This attitude came as a big shock to me, as until then
<br>
I'd thought that intelligence and the tendency to think critically went
<br>
hand-in-hand.
<br>
<p>Reducing the 'sheep-effect' by introducing extropian concepts, science, and
<br>
encouraging a more questioning attitude must come under the heading of a
<br>
'good thing'.
<br>
<p>An extropian outreach program!!  Now there's an idea .... (gotta be careful
<br>
it doesn't become dogmatic, though).
