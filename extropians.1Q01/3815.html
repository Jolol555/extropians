<p>Well, for starters (I will fondly hope) the Taliban.  There is one &quot;culture&quot;
<br>
that I would be most pleased to help kevorkian into oblivion forever.
<br>
If we provide them with knowledge of the alternative, especially
<br>
the young and those with the most to gain, perhaps we can help
<br>
break their chains.  Of course, they must *choose* to overthrow
<br>
their oppressors.  Granted, providing technological advance
<br>
will be to the detriment of *some* members of that society.  Tough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ..that you don't have a problem with this &quot;brand of cultural imperialism&quot; is
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hey, I can take you downtown in the city where I live and actually
<br>
*show* you buildings that are *over* 30 years old!   Why they
<br>
havent ripped that rickety mess outta there and replaced it with
<br>
something new is beyond me, but there is no accounting for taste.
<br>
I have actually *seen* items in people's homes that are said to be
<br>
aged nearly 30 years.  I myself still own a 4 function calculator. {8^D
<br>
<p>Actually, when I read Samanthas original post, I don't think she
<br>
was necessarily *objecting* to cultural imperialism.  *Any* culture
<br>
would be imperialist, given the opportunity.  The fact that the
<br>
west has the communications media expertise to seize that opportunity,
<br>
to aggressively export its culture, is a matter that causes me to lose
<br>
no sleep, not one minute, not a second.
<br>
<p>Let the west provide the movies, the television, the cell phones,
<br>
internet and all the knowledge that goes with it, and the world will
<br>
follow.  Mihail, share the vision:  we will all live in peaceful economic
<br>
competition and mutually beneficial struggle for advancement, to
<br>
the detriment of superstition, religion and cultural oppression.  spike
