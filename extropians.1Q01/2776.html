<em>&gt; &gt; Ugh - I read this with dread.  As someone who has always gotten pleasure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out of high-performance cars (and other machines) (see:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch3/cars.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch3/cars.html</a>), I sincerely hope this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology WILL be used to improve the safety and reliability of autos and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other transportation technology, but that it won't tempt the nannies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; castrate high-performance cars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What I wouldn't at all mind seeing and something I've thought about before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is employing technology to allow multiple classes of driver's licenses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to regulate speed in proportion to a machine's capabilities and the road
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conditions it encounters.  I would gladly pay more for, take a test to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and tolerate some slight intrusion into my road-going privacy to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to legally drive faster than current law allows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The speed limiting technology is mainly concerned about pedestrian deaths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and injuries in built-up areas. A pedestrian hit at 40 mph will almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly die - at 30 mph half will survive. That is why enforcing 30 mph in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towns is considered to be important. Drivers have an incidental benefit as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they and their cars will also suffer less injury in low-speed shunts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But how many pedestrians do you see on the interstate?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no theoretical barrier to having unlimited speed areas on freeways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at certain times. But you would never get the laws passed to permit it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there would always be a mix of capabilities of cars and drivers at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times. Here in UK the freeways are busy at all times of the day and night -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's a crowded little country! :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What if you made all cars follow automatic guidance installed in the
<br>
roadways and freed the former drivers to surf the net or whatever?  This
<br>
would insure all vehicles acted uniformly and to plan.  There has been
<br>
work done showing that the traffic flow could go a consistent 85 miles
<br>
and hour or more in most major commute corriders with greatly improved
<br>
saftey under such a system.  I would vote for it in a heartbeat as long
<br>
as it was at least as safe as my own reflexes and coordination can be in
<br>
the current scenario.  I could use the commute time quite productively.
