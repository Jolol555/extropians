<p>I'm not sure it is.
<br>
<p>There's an old saying to the effect that &quot;he who is most immersed in
<br>
an ideology is most likely to be blind to it&quot; -- we don't notice those
<br>
attitudes and outlooks that we are deeply submerged in until we leave
<br>
our own culture and look at it from outside. 
<br>
<p>Here in the UK, a lot of public policy is influenced by ostensibly
<br>
Christian attitudes and moral issues, even though the government and the
<br>
population are secular (such that only about 50% of the population 
<br>
believe in God, only 20% are regular churchgoers, and only about 10%
<br>
are believers in the literal truth of the Bible). In the USA, the
<br>
proportion of believers is much higher (IIRC, &gt;90% belief in God, &gt;30% 
<br>
are regular churchgoers, and so on). These beliefs influence us even
<br>
when we aren't clearly conscious of it. For example, our attitudes
<br>
to work, unemployment, charity, and so forth arise from mutation of
<br>
traditional Christian mechanisms. Our banking infrastructure is
<br>
descended from that of mediaeval Europe, with conventions on the 
<br>
morality of interest payments and loans that we never question (because
<br>
they're useful to us) but which were originally determined by religious
<br>
courts. And look at the social infrastructure -- things like family
<br>
structures, marriage, the raising of children, attitudes towards sexual
<br>
involvement, and so on.
<br>
<p>Our culture is heavily influenced by religion (specifically, Christianity)
<br>
to a degree that we fail to recognize only because we're deeply immersed in 
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and Islamic leaders can and have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toppled for religious reasons. There are lines they will not cross 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or will die or lose power upon crossing). Egypt? Look what happened 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Sadat for valuing international relations over religious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divisions.
</em><br>
<p>Are you aware of the IAF paintball raid in October 1973, shortly before
<br>
the end of the Yom Kippur War, and of why the Soviet balistic missile
<br>
forces went onto Red Alert (followed by the USA going to Defcon 2)
<br>
about 24 hours before the end of that war? Clue: Sadat had a *very*[1]
<br>
good reason for making a permanent peace with Israel, and another *very*
<br>
good reason for not publicly admitting it. Which is why a lot of his own
<br>
citizens saw him as a traitor -- his assassination wasn't a purely
<br>
religious thing. (Think Dolchstoss syndrome, and compare with the 
<br>
history of Weimar Germany. There's nothing new in political history ...)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<br>
<em>&gt;   There are serious problems with civil liberties that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are in my opinion the strongest reasons for technological inertia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; underdevelopment, but they are not primarily of a religious nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **An awful lot of those civil liberties problems--particularly as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regards women--are, I would say, entirely of a religious nature. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've got dudes patrolling the streets to make certain that women 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not dressed improperly, in some of these nations.
</em><br>
<p>It's still worth remembering that when Islam was a *new* religion,
<br>
the legal status of women was elevated extraordinarily compared to 
<br>
the preceding situation. In general Islam was welcomed by women because
<br>
it turned them into legal individuals rather than chattel. 
<br>
<p>By standards prevailing in the west today, their status doesn't look too
<br>
good -- but it varies substantially between different countries; judging
<br>
the Islamic world by Kabul under the Taliban is like judging the west
<br>
by conditions in some snake-fondling fundy backwater in the Deep South.
<br>
It's newsworthy, but not representative.  As for the clothing thing, 
<br>
when did you last walk down the street naked in your home town?  Standards 
<br>
of dress differ between societies, and if you violate American legal norms
<br>
you'll find yourself locked up just as fast as in an Islamic country.
<br>
We aren't as far out of the Victorian era as you might think.
<br>
<p>This isn't by way of making an apologia for excesses carried out in the
<br>
name of Islam; I'm an atheist, of Jewish descent, with little time for
<br>
religion of any type. But I believe a lot of what we take for pragmatic
<br>
cultural adaptation is nothing of the sort -- it's historical detritus
<br>
left over from a time when the west was more inclined to religiosity
<br>
than it is today.
