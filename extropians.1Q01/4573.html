<em>&gt; I asked, somewhat rhetorically, in my earlier post whether the memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect of _2001_ is what folks on this list would consider &quot;Extropian&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, and mentioned that the appearance of the &quot;Star-Child&quot; (as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called in Clarke's novel) in near-Earth space at the end of the movie is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of an event-horizon Singularity, since the movie gives no clue as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to what's going to happen next.
</em><br>
<p>Right, the sequels were a great disappointment in this regard.  Of course,
<br>
it would be dramatically impossible to continue the story past a
<br>
Singularity, so they basically had to pretend that it hadn't happened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not even Clarke's more explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation of the story tells us what's going to happen next:  &quot;Then he waited,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still untested powers.  For though he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was master of the world, he was not quite sure what to do next.  But he would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of something.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This was an echoing of the thoughts of the ape-man who had been first
<br>
enhanced by the monolith.  His sudden introduction to the use of tools
<br>
left him in a similar &quot;master of the world&quot; situation.  And of course
<br>
that did in fact lead to a qualitative change in the nature of life
<br>
on earth.  Presumably the next step will lead to another qualitative
<br>
change, consistent with our views of the Singularity.
<br>
<p>The biggest non-Extropian aspect of this is that the two Singularities
<br>
come from outside, through intentional manipulation.  It's a literal
<br>
&quot;deus ex machina&quot; since the intervenor is a machine.  In reality, as
<br>
compared to science fiction, Singularities come from within.  We evolved
<br>
intelligence and changed the world.  Intelligence will now intentionally
<br>
create super-intelligence and change the world again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, whatever his expectations of the Star-Child in particular,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kubrick's views about the long-term direction of life and consciousness in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe (from the _Playboy_ interview at <a href="http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q12.html">http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q12.html</a> )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem impeccably Extropian:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a few millennia -- less than a microsecond in the chronology of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe -- can you imagine the evolutionary development that much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species, which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine entities -- and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirit. Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ungraspable by humans.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This echoes the descriptions in the novel of the evolutionary path of the
<br>
creators of the monoliths.  I always assumed these words were written by
<br>
Clarke; they drip with his style and conceptual outlook.  It's odd that
<br>
Kubrick would quote them as his own, although of course it's possible
<br>
that this model was jointly conceived between him and Clarke.
