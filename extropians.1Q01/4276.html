<br>
<p>Thomas Malone was a primary investigator in studying the effects of
<br>
games on motivation. Malone wanted to find out how to design
<br>
activities that are intrinsically motivating (1980a). Intrinsically
<br>
motivating activities are those in which people will partake for their
<br>
own sake even though an external reward was not present. Malone
<br>
surveyed a group of kids who had been playing computer games for two
<br>
months, and asked them to rank their preferences. Malone found that
<br>
certain elements must be present in a game in order for them to be
<br>
enjoyable to children. By conducting a correlational study between
<br>
features of the games and popularity of the games, Malone found that
<br>
the element most highly correlated with popularity among children was
<br>
the presence of an explicit goal (Malone, 1980b). Other factors that
<br>
affect a game's popularity were the ability of the computer to keep
<br>
score, the presence of audio effects, randomness, and the reqirement
<br>
that the player responds quickly.
<br>
<p>In another study, Malone (1980b) took the game of Darts, which
<br>
attempts to teach children about fractions and number lines (the game
<br>
was originally designed and created by the Plato system at the
<br>
University of Illinois). Malone created different versions of the game
<br>
in order to find out which features kids found the most fun. One by
<br>
one, Malone deleted features like scoring, and music from the original
<br>
game so that he could determine at which point the game became less
<br>
fun. He also created different versions with different types of
<br>
feedback, and one game with no feedback. There was a significant
<br>
difference between boys and girls on which features were most
<br>
preferred. The boys liked a version of the game where fantasy arrows
<br>
shot and popped balloons, but the girls did not like this version. The
<br>
boys did not like the version where the computer gave them feedback
<br>
telling them they were shooting too high or too low, and the girls
<br>
liked the version with the music the most. Malone says that it is
<br>
important to understand the differences in preferences between boys
<br>
and girls because we might end up unintentionally designing software
<br>
that is meant to be motivating and educational, but does not succeed
<br>
at motivating both genders.
<br>
<p><p><p>In another study using the Darts game, Malone and Lepper (as cited in
<br>
Malone, 1980a) looked at whether the game was actually
<br>
educational. They tested two groups of kids using two versions of the
<br>
game. One version was the original Darts game, and the other one was a
<br>
drill game. The drill game was identical in educational content, but
<br>
instead of having arrows shooting balloons, there were simply
<br>
rectangles substituting for the balloons and horizontal lines which
<br>
replaced the arrows. One group of kids played the original game for
<br>
twenty minutes, or had the option to play Hangman. The second group of
<br>
kids could play the drill version of the game or Hangman for twenty
<br>
minutes. The kids who played the original game played almost fifty
<br>
percent longer than the kids with the drill version of the game,
<br>
showing that the game version was indeed more motivational. Did the
<br>
kids learn anything from the game? Malone and Lepper took three more
<br>
groups of kids and had them play for thirty minutes either the game
<br>
version or drill version, or Hangman as a control. The groups that
<br>
played the game version and the drill version learned significantly
<br>
more about fractions and number lines than did the control group who
<br>
played Hangman. There was no significant difference in knowledge
<br>
between the group that played the game version and the group that
<br>
played the drill version. When given a choice, however, a child will
<br>
spend fifty percent more time on the game version. It is therefore
<br>
expected that a child would learn more from an educational game than
<br>
from an educational drill.
