From: Charlie Stross &lt;<a href="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20No%20Federal%20parole&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101301456.GAA03610@well.com&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Er, no.  We're discussing people who are in prison. They're in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prison because a negative reinforcement -- threat of imprisonment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- didn't prevent them committing offenses while they were *out*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of prison. Why should threatening them with a negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reinforcement work while they're *inside*?
</em><br>
<p>They're in prison because they decided the possibility of being
<br>
incarcerated was lower than it actually is. Negative reinforcement
<br>
is used in jail already, its called solitary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are several reasons why people end up in prison. One is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they may be participating in a victimless crime -- one that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assume everybody on this list agrees *shouldn't* be a crime, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is -- and they get careless or unlucky. (I'm going to ignore this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;category, with the caveat that it could be my turn next -- or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yours.) 
</em><br>
<p>I agree to skip so called victimless crimes, I do not engage in any
<br>
behavior which if discovered could result in incarceration so thats
<br>
null as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Another is that they've got poor impulse control and act stupidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(and illegally) on the spur of the moment. This latter group isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to stop acting on impulse just because they've been plonked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into a new environment. However, if we can try to train them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consistently work towards a long-term goal, we may be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improve their impulse control. Guess what: trying to qualify for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early release has got to be a valid goal for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prisoner! So there's one category of criminal who may find the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunity for parole to be a major incentive to reform.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, which is why I suggested we set up a voluntary program
<br>
where they can work, and work hard on their rehabilitation. I
<br>
disagree on parole being used to ensure passive behavior.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;The only problem here is that it sounds like parole is automatic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the system you're describing. The system *I'm* describing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one where it isn't automatic: you qualify for it by good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behaviour. Clear?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is pretty much automatic the way it is enacted now. We
<br>
agree that early release is omething they must actively work for
<br>
and qualify for.
<br>
<p>Clear?

<p>That's something of course.
