<br>
<em>&gt; Poetry can be alot more complicated to translate and interpret. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me that it is tied much deeper to the language and to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture and other social contexts than music. Form, rhythm, rhyme, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embedded meanings within meanings would need to be translated.
</em><br>
<p>This is why Hofstadter's book of translations is so interesting.  (I should 
<br>
admit that I haven't read the book.  My understanding is based on a talk he 
<br>
gave at PARC at which he displayed several of his own translations into 
<br>
English as well as his own and other people's translations into a variety 
<br>
of other languages.)  Hofstadter's constant struggle as he wrote many very 
<br>
different translations of the poem was to capture the tone, style, rhythm, 
<br>
and meaning of the original.  For a long time, he said, he stuck to the 
<br>
original syllable counts, since it was a particular french style with short 
<br>
(4-syllable?) lines.  One thing he tried was changing that restriction, 
<br>
since English seemed to need more syllables to say the same things as 
<br>
French.  He also varied vocabulary, strictness of rhyme, how closely he 
<br>
stuck to the original metaphors, and quite a bit more.  His translations 
<br>
explored many dimensions of what it might mean to capture the intent of the 
<br>
original.  If anyone is qualified to consider what it would mean to 
<br>
translate a poem, I think it would have to be Hofstadter.
<br>
<p>And thanks for the poetry selections to start out a cold winter Friday.
<br>
<p>Another good example of translated poetry is in the work of Stanislaw Lem, 
<br>
translated from Polish to English.  The Cyberiad has two robots engaging in 
<br>
a poetry duel.  One is challenged to write &quot;a poem about a haircut! But 
<br>
lofty, nobel, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet 
<br>
heroism in the face of certain doom! Six lines, cleverly rhymed, and every 
<br>
word beginning with the letter &quot;s&quot;!&quot;  Of course he succeeds and it's quite 
<br>
a good poem, but when you've read it and thought about it, you end up 
<br>
wondering about the translation and the original text.  The Translator may 
<br>
have had good material to work with but he still did a brilliant job of 
<br>
communicating the sense of it.
