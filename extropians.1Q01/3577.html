<p>How violent you could socially acceptably get away with would vary
<br>
widely, but in many places the penalty could be quite high. You
<br>
could probably grab the offender and get in one really good shot
<br>
almost anywhere though....

<p><em>&gt;I notice that Americans seem to be fanatical about defending their

</em><br>
<p>We are the descendants of people who were taken advantage of, and
<br>
determined that nothing like that will ever happen again. We are
<br>
fiercely independent and dammed proud of it.
<br>
<p>In most places the use of deadly force to protect property is not
<br>
permitted/acceptable. However say breaking into someone's home will
<br>
get you wasted almost everywhere.
