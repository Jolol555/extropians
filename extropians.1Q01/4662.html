<em>&gt; &gt; soon every nation has a collection of stunningly expensive hardware,

</em><br>
<p>We sell them the upgraded droid.  We are even so kind as to offer
<br>
10 cents on the dollar for their outdated hardware which we graciously
<br>
resell at half the original price to a still less developed country, and
<br>
pocket the change once again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It'll be awfully embarassing for an alpha to just write

</em><br>
<p>Exactly!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; especially if there's some littler nation around that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gosh-darn it, hasn't been able to afford *any* P4 droids yet...
</em><br>
<p>Right you are again!  In any case, the first fighter droids are far
<br>
more effective as warriors than the old meat droids, the
<br>
18 yr old privates, who have those troublesome old fashion
<br>
emotions, that cut and run whenever they see a mechanized
<br>
adversary on the horizon.  Another annoying characteristic
<br>
of the meat droids is their all too human habit of surrendering
<br>
when a third of their company has been injured or killed,
<br>
unlike the battlebots who fight remorselessly until the last
<br>
machine falls.  They have no surrender software.
<br>
<p>My notion is that this development will fulfill Alfred Nobel's
<br>
vision of ending warfare forever.  Nobel thought that TNT
<br>
would make war so dangerous as to end the horrifying
<br>
practice, but in fact TNT did not end war, nor did
<br>
mechanized armor, nor did nuclear weapons.
<br>
<p>For war to end forever, its cost must not be counted in loss
<br>
of life but rather in loss of actual money, their precious gold,
<br>
something which the warrior chiefs will be much less willing
<br>
to spend than mere teenage human lives.
<br>
<p>If the techno-advanced part of the world offers ever more
<br>
expensive battlebots to the warrior chiefs, which are
<br>
more effective fighters than *all* of that nation's young men,
<br>
and then keep offering ever more expensive upgrades to
<br>
keep up with the neighboring warrior chiefs, we will keep
<br>
hammering and hammering the simple lesson that every
<br>
private in every foxhole already knows: that all war is madness,
<br>
that all war is a brutal crime against humanity.
<br>
<p>We thus reinforce the lesson that the less-advanced nations are
<br>
in fact enslaved to the techno-haves, until they learn to put
<br>
aside meaningless tribal conflicts, to extend the olive branch
<br>
to their neighbors, to join together as entities which do not
<br>
wage war on each other, a bit like the 50 united states.
<br>
They join together, if for no other reason, to survive economically
<br>
and escape abject slavery to those nations that build droids.
<br>
And if that doesnt work, we simply raise the price until it does.
<br>
<p>This is my techno-dove vision of the future.  spike
