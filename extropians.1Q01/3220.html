<p>Dr Tame, if you'd used the time spent composing this rebuke in googling for
<br>
the two items of information you asked me to send, you'd already have the
<br>
urls.
<br>
<p>But why didn't I include the provenance in the first place, and why was I
<br>
irritated that you couldn't be bothered doing  your own search? Well,
<br>
people on this list usually do include such information if it's at hand,
<br>
and seems salient. If it's missing, one might reasonably assume that it
<br>
wasn't readily available. 
<br>
<p>That is the case here. As well, I chose not to take the extra effort to
<br>
find and include it because I thought people would be interested in the
<br>
ideas expressed, not where they first appeared in print. (Besides, anyone
<br>
who did wish to track down the sources could readily do so, by googling to
<br>
Malik Kenan's name, combined with those of the two reviewers). I'd need to
<br>
repeat those steps myself in order to recover those irrelevant details
<br>
(irrelevant to me, if not to you, but then that's your business not mine),
<br>
and being hectored with news of your busy life doesn't really persuade me
<br>
to make that effort. 
<br>
<p>For a formal analysis of the two-way protocols involved, you might consult
<br>
H. Paul Grice, on the Cooperative Principle and other principles of
<br>
conversational implicature (Grice, P., 1989, *Studies in the Way of Words*.
<br>
Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press).
