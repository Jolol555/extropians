<em>&gt;Capitalism: An economic system in which investment in and ownership

</em><br>
<p>But our government exchanges much wealth in the form of taxation and 
<br>
social programs.  Our government owns a lot of land and natural 
<br>
resources.  Our government substantially affects much of the growth 
<br>
of the private sector through the central bank - as we've well noted 
<br>
over the past year.
<br>
<p>So, ours is not a nation based upon pure capitalism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;The failure that you mention for capitalism is more of a failure
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;utter failure like experiments in communism have been.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Capitalism isn't supposed to overcome democracy, it's an economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not a political system. Besides here in the U.S. we are not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Democracy, we are a Republic.
</em><br>
<p>A Republic is just a Democracy with a little extra buffering.  I was 
<br>
speaking of the force of democracy vs capitalism, and that force of 
<br>
democracy is present in our Republic for all intents and purposes.
<br>
<p>Make no mistake, however, capitalism and democracy are often at odds. 
<br>
They frequently compete for the same resources and rewards, but 
<br>
whereas our Republic uses votes from people and elected 
<br>
representatives to decide priorities, capitalism uses the voting 
<br>
power of the dollar.
<br>
<p>Since both these systems have a lot of power in our society, they're 
<br>
both constantly battling one another.  Discussing whether capitalism 
<br>
is or isn't *supposed* to overcome democracy isn't the question for 
<br>
me so much as where we should set the proper balance.  Personally, I 
<br>
think that our present success as a capitalistic nation should lead 
<br>
us to venture further in that direction.  There are plenty of 
<br>
examples of more socialistic countries that we can look at in the 
<br>
world.  Except for some superior privacy rules, I don't see where 
<br>
they have much to offer us.
<br>
