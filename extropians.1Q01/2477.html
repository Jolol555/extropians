</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  even argue with you about what you &quot;really&quot; believe!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you carefully spell out the logic of your position and I

</em><br>
<p>Very true.  I was complaining about the times when this doesn't 
<br>
occur.  These are the times when someone either misunderstands a 
<br>
position or assumes a position that isn't there.  Then the position 
<br>
being attacked is not one that has been pointed out.
<br>
<p>The most common example of this would be in the clone-copy problem 
<br>
where both sides accused the other of believing in mystical souls. 
<br>
Nobody ever espoused this view, yet people project this view on the 
<br>
other side and fought against it many times.  When the other side 
<br>
objected that they don't believe in mystical souls, the attacking 
<br>
party would try to logically prove that they *must*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Let me know if anybody has any insights on this problem or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  knows a way out of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think one major insight is: generally, both parties feel the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same way.  I don't think it's a case of one person pigeon-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;holing the other - it's more like argument entropy: You slowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pigeon-hole each other until you end up arguing with yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(I'll admit that, personally, I sometimes find bits and pieces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of another person's argument that I find compelling and attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those rather than what the person is saying.  So, in effect, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end up arguing with the wrong person.)
</em><br>
<p>Very true.  Most of us respond to our interests and not the original 
<br>
poster's interests.  Thus, conversations veer off wildly into 
<br>
unrelated territory, leaving the original poster abandoned and 
<br>
confused.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Take your own post for example: You probably just saw an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example of an argument that reminded you of this phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and compelled you to post about the general case.  However, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could quite easily be taken as an attack on those defending
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Microsoft, who, upon reading this, might think you're accusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them of using rather underhanded debate tactics.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words, your own email could be seen - from one point of view -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as pigeon-holing your opponents.  (For example, your first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paragraph was spent defining the tactics of &quot;them&quot; and by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quoting Samantha - who in turn mentions &quot;Eugene and others&quot; -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you have effectively defined &quot;us&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is another meta-problem with this kind of communication. 
<br>
We are trying to hold a conversation where we may or may not have 
<br>
heard all the previous pieces.  This means that any post is really 
<br>
taken out of context and may not mean what its stand-alone text would 
<br>
seem to convey.
