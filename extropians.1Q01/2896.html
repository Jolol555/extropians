<p>What is this, Fantasy Island? No offense intended. They will either 
<br>
largely exterminate themselves or be largely exterminated by others, 
<br>
failing a tech fix. Their resentment of the Haves is irrelevant 
<br>
without the intelligence and the hardware to do something about it. 
<br>
Look to Africa; that's the future of the majority of the human race, 
<br>
right there. It may well be ours as well: Anarchy, warlords, 
<br>
starvation, disease, slaughter.  At least, the way we're going it is. 
<br>
No doubt about it.

<em>&gt; &gt; I think that if you gave everyone in India who is starving a

<em>&gt; Yes, precisely...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we all dream of - or maybe at least feel highly of - a world like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Asimov described in Aurora: a whole planet divided into a relatively small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of large properties, each of them governed by virtually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-sustained hominids and their robots.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth could be a place like that, but... with 6 billion people? I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know. Can the planet sustain 6 billion individuals with high energy/space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs? If not - how do you get the population down to something more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable - say 500 million? (An arbitrary figure, I just pulled it out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thin air.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the obvious solution is to take a shotgun and some ammo and fire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away at will. But if we're doing this in the name of improved quality of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, this is clearly not an option.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An interesting idea might be to just leave the non-developed countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone; create a high-tech, self-sufficient society in one part of the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and leave the other poor suckers to be as they are. But these poor suckers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are a potential threat all along - they will develop weapons to threaten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with, they will develop industry that will pollute your environment, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will cause local animal species to become extinct, and so on. So, you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want underdeveloped neighbors in your perfect world, because they spoil your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dream of a perfect world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you get around to dealing with them - preferrably in a humane and
</em><br>
