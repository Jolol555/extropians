<em>&gt; Nowthen, seems to me like we could develop a robolamb
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety, and act like it too: it would wander alongside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herd, bawling like an orphan.  But with an important difference:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the robolamb would have built-in image recognition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be able to figure out when the wolf pack was closing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in!  The robolamb would bleat helplessly until the big bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wolf came in for the kill, at which time it would turn to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face the approaching attacker and give the stalking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carnovore a snoot full of double ought buck.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The farmers would love such a device!  Especially if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image recognition software in the robolamb became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated enough to distinguish between wolves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.
</em><br>
<p><p>Ranchers already have such a device, that is both cheaper and more
<br>
effective:  llamas.
<br>
<p>The use of llamas in sheepherding in the U.S. is only a couple decades
<br>
old, but has done very well.  A substantial fraction of sheep flocks now
<br>
have a couple llamas thrown in.  You see lots of llamas in Montana, Idaho,
<br>
and similar sheepherding places in the Pacific Northwest.
<br>
<p>The advantages of a llama are:
<br>
<p>1.)  They require zero maintenance and can survive just about anywhere.
<br>
2.)  They have an inexplicable paternal instinct for sheep.
<br>
3.)  They have superior natural sheepherding abilities and will keep the
<br>
flock together as well as any sheepdog. 
<br>
4.)  They will viciously and aggressively attack any canid that approaches
<br>
the flock (wolves, dogs, coyotes).  With their height, they can identify
<br>
threats a long way off.
<br>
5.)  They are cheap, only costing a few hundred dollars.
<br>
<p><p>By a strange coincidence of nature, llamas appear to be the ultimate sheep
<br>
tending mechanism, as they will integrate themselves with the flock and
<br>
have a natural tendency to herd and protect them.  Apparently wolves and
<br>
coyotes do poorly against the llamas as they are relatively large and
<br>
capable of much more violence than sheep.  The downside is that sheepdogs
<br>
can end up on the receiving end of that violence, so you have to keep them
<br>
clear of the llamas.
