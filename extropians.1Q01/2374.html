<em>&gt; but a major and WRONG statement - people who associate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different functional characteristics with &quot;life&quot; and &quot;nonlife&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Hm. Yes, you are correct. I do seem to be awfully aggressive lately. Please
<br>
bear with me.
<br>
<p>Question: from an extropian point of view, is it meaningful to differentiate
<br>
between life and non-life?
<br>
<p>Suppose I manage to program your Pentium so it acts as if it were alive. For
<br>
additional artistic impression, I manage to do it so that it can be encased
<br>
in a walking and talking human-like body. [Suppose for purposes of
<br>
illustration that a Pentium would suffice for such AI.]
<br>
<p>Pentiums, as we 'know', are non-life. But a walking talking Pentium that
<br>
even seems to think like a human being...?
<br>
<p>If we should associate different functional characteristics with &quot;life&quot; and
<br>
&quot;nonlife&quot;, what functional characteristics should we associate with such an
<br>
entity?
<br>
<p>This is probably an issue so obvious that it has been discussed time and
<br>
again on this list, and your message that I quote above was perhaps written
<br>
with the conclusions of such a discussion in mind. I haven't checked the
<br>
archives for this possibility though.
<br>
<p>Anyway. To put it loosely, and not necessarily with direct relevance to the
<br>
question raised above: it seems to me we people don't really mind whether
<br>
something is alive or not, we just think we do. We complain against cruel
<br>
treatment of animals; yet when we come to a restaurant, we order a steak.
