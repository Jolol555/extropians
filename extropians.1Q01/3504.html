<em>&gt; &gt; Numerical inferiority would be so overwhelming in any such situation, that

<em>&gt; They'd crush us like bugs.  I agree with Sandberg; the most effective

</em><br>
<em>&gt; influential with a receptive audience.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with newspaper articles and such is that they tend to be dry,
<br>
and not very convincing to the public at large.  Very few people remember
<br>
a moving editorial; only a few more remember a story in a major news 
<br>
magazine like Time or Newsweek.
<br>
<p>A page needs to be taken from the pro-life/pro-choice playbook:  We need
<br>
to rephrase the debate in terms of something for which most people are in
<br>
favor.  It will NOT help to be anti-environment; not only does that run
<br>
counter to what many of us really believe, but it will score us no points 
<br>
at all in he long run with people who will find it easy to revile positions
<br>
we hold based on how we're all &quot;pave the earth&quot; types.  
<br>
<p>A well-organized sloganeering capaign could revolve around &quot;End World Hunger 
<br>
NOW!&quot; - no one is for world hunger, after all.  When one of the more activist
<br>
types gets in your face about being pro-genetic engineering and thus anti-
<br>
environment, ask them at the top o fyour voice how many acres of virgin 
<br>
wilderness had to be cleared to grow their &quot;all-natural&quot; cotton and/or hemp
<br>
clothes, or grow their organic fruits and vegetables?  How many acres of 
<br>
animal habitat were destroyed so they could feel good about themselves wearing
<br>
&quot;all-natural&quot; fibers?  THAT is the sort of sound bite that will make it 
<br>
into the media, and show the ecofundamentalists for what they really are -
<br>
a radical fringe group.
<br>
<p>&quot;Save Animal Habitat: Reduce Land Use for Cultivation of Crops!&quot;
<br>
&quot;No More Pesticide Sprays!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Grow Smarter, Not Harder!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Luddites, go home!  Just Say No to the Stone Age!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Think Future!  Reject Dogma!&quot;
<br>
&quot;No Habitat Was Destroyed In Making MY Dinner!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Eat Food, Not Animal Homes!&quot;
<br>
<p>Just some ideas on how this sort of loud sloganeering by even a small group
<br>
of people can attract a fair bit of media attention, and maybe even dislodge
<br>
some of the younger minds that flock to the banners of these radical
<br>
environmentalist groups.
