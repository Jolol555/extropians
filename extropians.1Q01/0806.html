<p>No. Nor do we have to, since elementary physics
<br>
suffices. The only thing which distinguishes a nuke
<br>
from anything else is radiation, a passive property. 
<br>
Which is being emitted from behind a shield on a 
<br>
noisy background, and has a distance of some 100 km 
<br>
filled with atmosphere between source and detector. 
<br>
Plus, you have a lot of terrain to cover, so you can't
<br>
look for very long.
<br>
<p>On such a distance you have a much better chance
<br>
seeing the infrared emission from the nuke surface,
<br>
which is (at best) few degrees K above background. 
<br>
Which is just as silly.

<p>Um, gamma quanta are not special. There are a lot of hot 
<br>
nuclei around here, and see the cosmic ray background. 
<br>
You would should be able to detect a nuke with it's nitrogen-rich
<br>
high explosive shell around it from a few m distance, but
<br>
that's about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; are feeble. Can such things be detected from a great
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; look down here? Good chance.
</em><br>
<p>If you insist in making a fool out of yourself in a public 
<br>
place, be my guest.
