</em><br>
<p>I'd like to agree with you, but I can't. (Again.) Human cultures are 
<br>
nasty, brutal, and put up with practices that I (and you) find
<br>
abhorrent. For example ...
<br>
<p>Incest is _not_ a universal taboo. It was historically practiced for 
<br>
many centuries by the Egyptian upper classes -- at the time, the most
<br>
successful civilization on the planet -- and is practiced today by a
<br>
number of cultures. It has been argued (seen it in Sci. Am., past
<br>
couple of years -- can't be any more specific than that, sorry) that
<br>
incest is *good* for a civilization: bad recessives tend to get
<br>
weeded out efficiently in the form of a slightly elevated level of
<br>
still-births, but the Victorian stereotype of the drooling subnormal
<br>
product of the incestuous family is largely a fantasy.
<br>
<p>In fact, the incest taboo in western (read: European-descended) societies
<br>
is largely a by-product of the early-mediaeval Church, which cooperated
<br>
with feudal monarchs to prevent the great families from concentrating too
<br>
much power (by forcing them to inter-marry).
<br>
<p>Again, rape: it has been practiced for many centuries (millennia, even)
<br>
in warfare against conquered populations. Arranged marriages frequently
<br>
amounted to rape. Indeed, under English law (until startlingly recently)
<br>
it was not legally possible for a husband to be charged with rape of his
<br>
wife. The criminal charge in your law and mine was originally treated
<br>
as a crime against property -- the male custodian of a woman could be
<br>
damaged financially if her virginity was called into question prior to
<br>
marriage.
<br>
<p>Murder ... yes, it's a universal taboo -- but only when killing is so
<br>
defined. Many societies have situations (such as a blood feud) under which
<br>
killing of another person is socially sanctioned, if not approved of. Your
<br>
own country abolished duelling some time ago, and would now consider it
<br>
to be murder -- but I'd like to point to it as an example of legal 
<br>
premeditated homicide.
<br>
<p>Theft ... okay, I'll grant you that one. Humans are territorial, and we
<br>
extend our sense of personal territory to our posessions. But the 
<br>
taboo applies to being on the receiving end of theft -- there's no
<br>
shortage of would-be thieves!
<br>
<p>As for &quot;these taboos wouldn't be universal if there were not some
<br>
objective basis for them&quot;, I strongly suggest you read &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;,
<br>
then start thinking about the applicability of Gould's argument about
<br>
contingency and randomness in evolution to the developments of societies.
