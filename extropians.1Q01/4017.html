From: Chris Russo &lt;<a href="mailto:extropy@russo.org?Subject=Re:%20Communism%20vs%20Capitalism&In-Reply-To=&lt;200102161621.IAA08151@well.com&gt;">extropy@russo.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Granted, there are no purely capitalist systems in existence.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could probably argue that there never have been purely communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or capitalist systems in existence, because some absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definition isn't being obeyed.  
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me Chris but I believe the economic system of the U.S does
<br>
qualify by definition:
<br>
<p>Capitalism: An economic system in which investment in and ownership
<br>
of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is
<br>
made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For example, in &quot;Communist Russia&quot;, there were those who had more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;money, power, and influence than others because of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positions.  Inequities like that would seem to be disallowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within a purely communist society.
</em><br>
<p>I think this successfully demonstrates communism's fatal flaw, it
<br>
is essentially incompatible with human nature. Of course if you
<br>
were to argue it wasn't &quot;pure&quot; communism simply because it was
<br>
unsuccessful, then no argument is possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think that you're redefining &quot;fails&quot; here.  communism fails in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the sense that the whole society stagnates.  Innovation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;productivity fall to levels that are incapable of supporting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society as a whole.  Even at Russia's height, the toilet paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lines were long, and medical care - though available - was poor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by western standards.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, communism fails.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The failure that you mention for capitalism is more of a failure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of capitalism to dominate and overcome democracy.  It's hardly an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;utter failure like experiments in communism have been.
</em><br>
<p>Capitalism isn't supposed to overcome democracy, it's an economic
<br>
not a political system. Besides here in the U.S. we are not a
<br>
Democracy, we are a Republic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Instead of pretending that there are absolutes in the world that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we can look at as examples, I think that it's important for us to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;examine the spectrum from predominately communist societies to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predominately capitalist ones.  At one end of the spectrum, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have the former Russia and China.  At the other end, you have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;United States.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;In which ways do the opposite ends of the spectrum even compare? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think that it's beating our own drum to say that the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is, overall, the most desirable place to live in the world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Immigration statistics alone make that fairly clear.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;As such, I think that those who decry communism in an offhand way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while trumpeting capitalism actually do have an argument for doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so.  It's not simply a matter of perspective as your post implied.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely.
