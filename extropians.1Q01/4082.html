<p><em>&gt; [snip] I very much want to be a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  John Q. Public about the wonders of science, and what it can do (and has
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  writers/communicators on this list)
</em><br>
<p>[snip discussion of reading good models in popular science and literature - 
<br>
which is VERY important.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Verbal communication, in speech and debate, is one area I cannot seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  find good information about.  I took a debate class, but it was less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  useless.  I would like to hone my speaking skills, and to that end I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  been making presentations for the Mars Society.  My major failing thus far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is that I have a low, soft, somewhat soothing voice, and it tends to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people to sleep.  I do, however, consider myself to be a good communicator,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and I often can understand where the person I'm talking to doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  understand, and smooth out conflicts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I know that there are people on this list who are good writers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  communicators.  For me, and those like me, please share your thoughts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  resources on how we can better communicate our visions.
</em><br>
<p>I make my living as a communicator and spend a good deal of time teaching 
<br>
young lawyers how to develop their written and oral communication and 
<br>
persuasion skills.  Based on that, I can make some observations.  First, 
<br>
there IS an element of natural talent in both kinds of communication, but 
<br>
whatever level of natural talent you have CAN be cultivated and improved.
<br>
<p>Second, you can learn some things about oral communication and advocacy from 
<br>
reading and writing.  The first step is to realize that oral communication is 
<br>
different in many respects from written communication and that the art of 
<br>
persuasion employs many different tools in the oral arena.  Things that work 
<br>
on the written page do not necessarily translate into good communication or 
<br>
persuasive speaking in the oral realm.
<br>
<p>I highly recommend that you get and read good contemporary speeches.  In my 
<br>
opinion the two greatest orators in English in the 20th Century were Winston 
<br>
Churchill and Martin Luther King Jr.  Read them carefully.  Study how they 
<br>
use cadence, rhythm and pacing to compliment the points they are making.  
<br>
Notice how they choose words for their aural impact and repeat key phrases as 
<br>
a means of focusing attention.  Then listen to the speeches after you've read 
<br>
them.  Then read them again.  I won't go into it here, but in fact there are 
<br>
a few simple tools that great speakers use that distinguish them from others. 
<br>
&nbsp;Studying Churchill and MLK, you'll see that there's a science to what they 
<br>
did, as well as an art.
<br>
<p>Finally, there is an essential animal element to in-person oral communication 
<br>
and advocacy that involves understanding, modulation and control of one's 
<br>
whole body as an instrument.  Again, there is a large element of natural 
<br>
endowment and talent in this, but whatever instrument you have can be tuned 
<br>
and amplified.
<br>
<p>When I was just starting out as an attorney, I was very fortunate to attend a 
<br>
two and half week &quot;boot camp&quot; for trial lawyers (the National Institute for 
<br>
Trial Advocacy) that was aimed at improving these skills.  The faculty 
<br>
consisted of practicing lawyers, judges, actors, theater directors, 
<br>
professional speech coaches and wardrobe consultants.  The curriculum 
<br>
consisted of individual exercises based on the different specific tasks that 
<br>
a trial lawyer must master to be a good advocate.  Each exercise was 
<br>
videotaped.  At the end of the each exercise, we were immediately critiqued 
<br>
by faculty members and other students who had viewed the exercise &quot;live&quot; .  
<br>
Then we went into a grueling &quot;stop-action&quot; critique by another set of 
<br>
teachers.  At the end of the program we tried a full case to a jury, who we 
<br>
then watched deliberate on video in real time.  Then we came home and watched 
<br>
the whole series on video again: The improvement was dramatic.
<br>
<p>Needless to say, most people who want to become better communicators won't go 
<br>
to the kind of lengths I describe above, which are appropriate for someone 
<br>
who makes their living as an advocate.  However, the basic techniques 
<br>
developed by NITA can be translated into tools you can use.  First, there is 
<br>
no substitute for DOING when it comes to oral communication and personal 
<br>
advocacy.  The more experience you get, if you take the extra steps necessary 
<br>
to learn from each &quot;outing&quot;, the better you'll be in communicating and 
<br>
persuading.  Those extra steps consist of getting useful feedback.  One 
<br>
invaluable tool is video recording.  Make yourself watch yourself and REALLY 
<br>
watch.  Another key ingredient is to do the watching WITH someone, who will 
<br>
offer honest criticisms (and, just as important, meaningful positive 
<br>
feedback).
<br>
<p>Following a course of training such as this WILL have a real impact on your 
<br>
abilities as a communicator.  You'll improve your poise and confidence and 
<br>
you'll become aware of your strengths and weaknesses as a communicator.
