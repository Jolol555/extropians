<p>JR&gt;Well, in that case, I think we could replace the word &quot;philosophy&quot; with
<br>
JR&gt;the term &quot;rational thinking and theorizing.&quot; We don't need to hypothesize
<br>
JR&gt;that a mysterious substance called &quot;philosophy&quot; somehow operates in
<br>
JR&gt;metaphysical conjunction with system design and rational thought.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A friend of mine works at a hotel. Some guest was upset about something and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called down to the front desk to complain. She said &quot;I'm sorry about that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sir..&quot;, and he replied &quot;I don't want to hear 'I'm sorry', I want an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apology&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think you are confused about what philosophy is - go to a bookstore and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find the philosophy section, and browse through some of the books. Spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some time doing it, and you'll find what is meant by &quot;philosophy&quot;. You'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see that some of it is valid and some is not.
</em><br>
<p>Been there, done that, written the encyclopedia of philosophy ... and I
<br>
don't
<br>
think *any* of it is valid ... the reason is that philosophy cannot compete
<br>
with
<br>
or evaluate natural (scientific) theories/ arguments.

Subject: Placebo effect not physical
<br>
<p>S&gt; OK. I also think that language is faulty and misleading in general,
<br>
S&gt; which I why I am starting to develop a word-free visual philosophy
<br>
S&gt; (some examples at www.extropia.net vis phil sector).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Being visual is not enough.
</em><br>
<p>S Nor is being wordy .....  but philosophy does not allow itself
<br>
S to use pictures, but in my approach I can use any symbolic forms.
<br>
<p>The reason that no philosophers to date can cope with MVT is that
<br>
it undermines their whole, carefully constructed but artificial, linguistic
<br>
edifice. Philosophy (academic) feeds on itself, but cannot agree or
<br>
disagree with empirical claims. &quot;Epiphenomenalism&quot; (of the mental
<br>
on the physical, the usual materialist variant) is demolished by the
<br>
placebo effect example ... since clearly in these cases the mind effects
<br>
the body ... and therefore the ludicrous epiphenomenalist claim that
<br>
no mental (non-physical) events take place/ have any causal effects
<br>
is refuted.
<br>
<p>MVT, the all-conquering (reductionist) philosophy will redefine this whole
<br>
field .... a shake-out that is long overdue.
