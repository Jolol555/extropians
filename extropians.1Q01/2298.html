<em>&gt; So, whether you accept it or not, you _are_ a part of a 'living' organism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are but a tiny cell in it. The organism takes care of you, and you make
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively participate in more than one such organism. As do I.
</em><br>
<p>Nothing in your post was very persuasive that society is a 'living
<br>
organism' in the sense you seem to want to claim it is.  Society is the
<br>
gestalt of individual beings freely working together in a matrix that
<br>
maximizes their ability to do so.  It is not a super-being I am a mere
<br>
cell in.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; Man has natural rights because he has evolved under the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of physics and biology to be the creature he/she is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This statement makes 0 sense to me. I see no logical structure to it. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds like &quot;man has rights because he is&quot;. Have you ever even defined what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the term 'rights' means?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Humans have natural rights because of the type of natural being they
<br>
are, because of their specific nature.  This is where 'natural' in
<br>
'natural rights' comes from.   'Rights' in this context are those
<br>
conditions in the interactions among human beings required by human
<br>
beings, by their nature, for optimal functioning.  Most such rights are
<br>
negative such as the non-initiation of physical force rather than
<br>
positive such as the supposed right some claim to goods provided by the
<br>
work of others.
