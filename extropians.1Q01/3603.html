</em><br>
<p>I never claimed that any corporation committed genocide (or any other crime) without
<br>
government-granted power. I think we're saying the same thing here, but in different ways. My point
<br>
was exactly that corporations have and do commit atrocities to further their own ends, but only when
<br>
they have co-opted the local government. How would it follow then that this makes the government the
<br>
culprit but not the corporation? It's collusion between the two groups, and they're both
<br>
responsible. My basic stance is that coercion, oppression and exploitation of people against their
<br>
will is wrong (or at least undesirable) no matter who is doing it. Certainly you can't disagree with
<br>
that? And laying all the blame on governments is no more useful for solving the problem than laying
<br>
all the blame on corporations. I'm trying to look at all the factors involved from as clear a
<br>
perspective as I can muster, rather than trying to make things adhere to any one ideology. Solutions
<br>
are more important to me than blaming and name-calling.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But you do need a government to force private citizens to sit there and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take it without any force in kind.
</em><br>
<p>You can call it government, the anarchists can call it corporations; it really doesn't matter as
<br>
long as it is happening. But by limiting ourselves to only one interpretation, we could be missing
<br>
something important. Again, let's look for solutions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Each individual would be capable of defending themselves against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporate gangs.
</em><br>
<p>This is unrealistic. Do you have your own private army?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Corporate abuses occur because they have the power of government to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support them. Remove the sovereign monopoly of government and corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of force withers away.
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that individuals and groups of people will always behave themselves (i.e., treat
<br>
other people's rights wth respect) as long as no one is telling them it's wrong to do so? Well,
<br>
maybe you would act that way and I would act that way, but can you really guarantee that everyone
<br>
will? This seems unrealistic and contradictory to your own philosophy (at least what I've seen
<br>
presented in this forum). Given an ideal state in which everyone shared the same basic values and
<br>
respect for one another, I suppose this is possible. But I believe you yourself said that an ideal
<br>
state is unstable. This seems contradictory.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yet you speak of genocide. Wife burning on the scale that occured in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; India prior to British conquest was on the same scale as many genocides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have occured in history. It belittles women's rights to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this practice is not genocidal-equivalent and that it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protected as some sort of 'cultural tradition' that is worthy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect. Its pathetic relativist crap like that that is truly hogwash.
</em><br>
<p>I would never condone wife burning in any culture, nor am I a cultural relativist when it comes to
<br>
such behaviors. I'm pretty sure I didn't make any such claims. As I tried to say, conquering a
<br>
country that indulges in this kind of behavior by committing equaly atrocious acts against them is
<br>
not really something to be proud of. And if you think this can be used as a justification for the
<br>
British conquest of India, you're simply wrong. There is no historical evidence that they conquered
<br>
India in order to keep women from being burned by their husbands. Rather, India was conquered to
<br>
further their own selfish ends, which makes them no better than any of the other oppressive groups
<br>
(like the communists) you've decried. This is the problem I have with imperialism, and it astonishes
<br>
me that you, a self-proclaimed libertarian, could defend it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are, in fact, as many Native Americans in north america today as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were before the conquistadors. Native Americans today live an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average of twice as long as their forebears, with a far higher standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of living.
</em><br>
<p>So, because some of the descendents of the conquered people have a higher standard of living (again,
<br>
your definition), this justifies centuries of genocide? Why would you defend this? Isn't the
<br>
forcible removal of any individual's liberty antithetical to the libertarian position? And how many
<br>
Native Americans have you interviewed? There is a strong body of anthropological and anecdotal
<br>
evidence that suggests life has been pretty bad for most Native Americans since the white man came
<br>
(if this has changed for the better, it's been very recently). Why deny this? You're not personally
<br>
responsible, yet you seem to cling to out-moded rationalizations like your life depended on it. Why
<br>
is it so hard to admit what was done, even condemn it, and then use this knowledge to help us move
<br>
forward so we can all have better, longer, happier lives? This seems reasonable to me. But, hey, I'm
<br>
an optimist.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Whether they become serfs or not is irrelevant. Were they abused by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialists more than they were under their local rulers? Look at Hong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kong, Singapore, and many other asian nations that were formerly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonies. The local rulers claim that political repression is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'cultural tradition' when westerners protest against it. Bollocks.
</em><br>
<p>How is any form of serfdom irrelevant? To claim that's it was okay for one group to conquer another
<br>
because they're not quite as bad is ludicrous. Aren't all forms of oppression wrong? We see to be
<br>
agreeing here, but I feel like you're clinging to something.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't have a dark view of humanity, or of evolution. It seems you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dark view of what I see as a natural system. Like a communalist, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that the natural system is dark, harsh, evil and bad in a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Calvinist/Puritan sense.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you feel the need to label me a communalist when I have never once claimed to be one? This is
<br>
not only counter-productive, it is insulting. And to compare me to a Calvinist/Puritan is laughable.
<br>
I'm about as far from that position as Pluto is from the sun. If I said something that honestly
<br>
indicates this to you, please point it out to me and I will be happy to clarify it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Human nature doesn't need to be changed, it needs to be informed. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't need to be chained, it needs to be unleashed and empowered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People are at their best when left to their own devices. It is only when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you confiscate liberty and concentrate power that you get abuses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corruption arises.
</em><br>
<p>I would never disagree with you on this, and am curious as to why you felt compelled to respond with
<br>
it. Do you think I said something to indicate otherwise? Very curious.
<br>
<p>I'm beginning to suspect that we could go around and around with this for some time. I also think
<br>
that we are often arguing for the same things, but are simply coming at it from disparate points of
<br>
view. This is good. It's what makes us individuals, and what keeps healthy discourse interesting.
<br>
<p>fun as always,
<br>
Neal
