It appears as if Ross A. Finlayson &lt;<a href="mailto:raf@tiki-lounge.com?Subject=Re:%20No%20Federal%20parole&In-Reply-To=&lt;200102011802.TAA18064@color.sics.se&gt;">raf@tiki-lounge.com</a>&gt; wrote:

|If any citizen is given and is made to consume any substance against their

<br>
<p>The term &quot;poisoned&quot; often implies that the person has ingested a poison.
<br>
The definition you used above makes the concept &quot;poisoned&quot; a less meaningful
<br>
one. Or maybe you try to make a political statement on the badness of giving
<br>
a subject a substance without their consent?
<br>
<p>By your definition above, if you administer any kind of medication to an
<br>
unconscious, you either poison that human, or that human lost its citizenship
<br>
with its consciousness, both rather uncommon standpoints.
<br>
<p>I understand that humans in some jurisdictions temporarily lose their
<br>
rights when convicted for a crime, so in those jurisdictions you would
<br>
find it acceptable to perform that kind of re-programming, then?
<br>
<p>Feel free to elaborate on your standpoint, in case you (dis)agree.

<br>
<p>Chocolate contains a large mix of various substances, some of which do induce
<br>
endorphin release in some subjects.
<br>
<p>|You mention that the drugs you mention have various effects, as well, various

<br>
<p>The effect of almost any substance depends a lot on the dosage administered.
