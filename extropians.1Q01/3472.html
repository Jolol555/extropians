I suspect a large part of the reason for the lack of popularizers is 
<br>
the fact that the scientific community in general tends to look down 
<br>
upon popularizers, even if they are scientists themselves. They seem 
<br>
to consider this sort of thing--as well as the sort of person who 
<br>
would engage in it--as being beneath their station. Thus, to become 
<br>
popular with the masses is quite often to become UNpopular with the 
<br>
scientific community. Not a good thing when your research and your 
<br>
career depend upon the opinions and support of others within the 
<br>
community.
<br>
<p>Another part of the reason is that a lot of these folks don't get out 
<br>
much. How many times have you heard an engineer speak of 
<br>
&quot;interfacing&quot; with people?
<br>
<p>You don't INTERFACE with people--you TALK to them!
<br>
<p>Finally, of course, there's arrogance. Is aw a bit of this in Crick, 
<br>
who absolutely detested interviews and refused to grant one. (I got 
<br>
him anyway, after talking my way past security and bypassing a few 
<br>
locked doors...) This was in his later years. Regardless of how lofty 
<br>
one's goals or how pressed one's time, public support is essential to 
<br>
science. At the very least, the lack of widespread public antagonism 
<br>
is essential.
<br>
<p>Popularization is therefore essential, and time must be set aside to 
<br>
educate the public in a manner they find comprehensible.
<br>
<p>Will make a few suggestions offlist.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I wonder why this is. Wish we could talk about this on the list and figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it out. It hasn't always been so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Even getting the people who could afford to fund the grooming of good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; spokespeople to recognize the need seems to be an uphill task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is something the people on this list could begin to remedy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immediately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Beginning with each person funding their own grooming (funding in terms of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have been thinking about this ever since I decided that a neuroscientist's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life is the life for me (hi-diddly-dee).  Though making a contribution to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the knowledge base (a ground-breaking theory or two would be nice, as well)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very important to me, I also feel a great responsibility to further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science through communicating about it.  If it wasn't for Damasio, Dennet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pinker, Hofstadter, Davis, Gazzaniga, et al, as well as some excellent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professors here in the neuroscience department at OSU, I would still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably be a disillusioned pre-med wannabe.  I very much want to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popularizer, to attract fresh blood to the science, as well as to inform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John Q. Public about the wonders of science, and what it can do (and has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done) for his life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can I get there from here?  (ATTN: Mr. Broderick and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writers/communicators on this list)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So far, I have been voraciously reading whatever I can get my hands on in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the area of popular science (my reading back-log is horrendous).  I do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only for knowledge about the specific science, but with an ear to how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they communicate.  I have found Steven Pinker to be excellent in this arena
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (his was the only non-fiction book I have ever read cover-to-cover in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; week, I usually jump around book to book).  At his advice, I'm looking into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joseph Williams _Style: Toward Clarity and Grace_, which Pinker says is &quot;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific style manual,&quot; in that it is informed by discoveries in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Linguistics in its attempt to create understandable and expressive prose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If anyone knows how else I can improve my writing skills, I would very much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like your advice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have also been reading fiction, both classics and modern, to discover how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they express themselves.  I consider the purpose of art to be expression,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I would like to use what I can learn about expression from art to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhance my expression in science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Verbal communication, in speech and debate, is one area I cannot seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find good information about.  I took a debate class, but it was less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless.  I would like to hone my speaking skills, and to that end I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been making presentations for the Mars Society.  My major failing thus far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that I have a low, soft, somewhat soothing voice, and it tends to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to sleep.  I do, however, consider myself to be a good communicator,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I often can understand where the person I'm talking to doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand, and smooth out conflicts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that there are people on this list who are good writers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicators.  For me, and those like me, please share your thoughts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources on how we can better communicate our visions.
