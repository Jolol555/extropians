<p>No, not all belief systems are rational.  But once someone has bought 
<br>
into a belief system, I believe they will act consistently and 
<br>
rationally given their beliefs.  The basic facts may be wrong, but 
<br>
the motivations and conclusions derived from them are natural 
<br>
ramifications of the facts as given.
<br>
<p>IF there is a God, then it makes sense to ignore human knowledge and 
<br>
pray directly to God for guidance.
<br>
<p>IF global warming is caused by greenhouse gasses, then it makes sense 
<br>
to cut back on these gasses
<br>
<p>IF nanotechnology can wipeout humanity due to a software error, and 
<br>
IF we can't figure out how to make software without errors, then it 
<br>
makes sense to ban nanotechnolgoy because we can't control it.
<br>
<p>IF cloning causes as many birth defects as viable births, it makes 
<br>
sense to ban cloning until we can make it safer.
<br>
<p>IF HIV can be transmitted through casual contact, it makes sense to 
<br>
avoid contact with infected individuals.
<br>
<p>IF other races are inferior, it makes sense not to breed with them.
<br>
<p>These are examples of erroneous beliefs.  But given these beliefs, 
<br>
their proponents usually act rationally and predictably in pursuing 
<br>
their goals.
