<p>It seems to be impossible to tell just how &quot;real&quot; things like this are from 
<br>
simple web browsing.  What does seem real is that there have been quite a few 
<br>
libertarian/lassez-faire projects with fairly grandiose plans announced and 
<br>
promoted through the web, which then sink beneath the waves, never to be 
<br>
heard from again.  What they all seem to have in common is a dream of 
<br>
creating an autonomous community free from government regulation, using the 
<br>
web as some kind of open intermediating resource.  The more grandiose ones 
<br>
call for creation of fixed or floating enclaves.  The latter all seem to 
<br>
suffer from fairly gross underappreciation of for just how expensive, complex 
<br>
and difficult maritime engineering and operations are.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, these schemes all seem to suffer from the same inter-related 
<br>
problem: They fail to achieve a necessary critical mass and don't appear to 
<br>
be very clear about how they mean to offer real value in the real world that 
<br>
can compete with existing social structures.  Yes, participating in a 
<br>
libertarian enclave sounds neat, but will I get sufficient value to pick up 
<br>
and move my life and business operations to another place that suffers from 
<br>
isolation and relatively poor physical infrastructure?  So far, no one has 
<br>
offered a compelling answer to this question.
<br>
<p>One kind of business that MIGHT need the sort of freedom offered by these 
<br>
enclave ideas is human genengineering.  Assuming that a clinic offering a 
<br>
real benefit could be created in the kind of isolation an enclave would 
<br>
require, the services it could offer might generate enough value to offset 
<br>
the costs of being located in a remote, relatively undeveloped place.  To 
<br>
achieve this, you'd have to have some proven human genengineering technology 
<br>
that is prohibited everywhere else, and a group of clinicians willing to 
<br>
sever their ties with the rest of the world due to the professional 
<br>
condemnation they would suffer . . . A big leap . . .
