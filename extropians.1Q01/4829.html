Of course. What Dr. Minsky was unsuccessfully trying to debunk was what
<br>
is sometimes called &quot;lightsailing&quot; (a subcategory of solar sailing),
<br>
where a &quot;lightsail&quot; is built and payloaded so &quot;light&quot; (yes, a pun) that
<br>
it can hang in sunlight at zero orbital velocity. I seem to recall 60
<br>
tons per square mile of aluminum as a figure close to that.
<br>
<p>The terrific advantage of a lightsail over a heavier solar sail is that
<br>
it can assume positions and take trajectories which are _not_ orbits.
<br>
One could in principle hang a lightsail in geostationary position over
<br>
New Jersey (five no-prize points to the first person to identify the
<br>
obscure reference).
<br>
<p>Lightsail is to solar sail as sailplane is to glider. Gliders are
<br>
sturdy, and they work, but sailplanes have significant advantages re
<br>
maneuverability, catching thermals, etc.
