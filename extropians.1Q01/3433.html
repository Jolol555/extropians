</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; ...I think it's important to be aware of and REALLY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is that the movement in opposition to technological progress is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective in organizing and getting its message out.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with Greg that if you want to win an argument, you must understand
<br>
the opponent's position as clearly as you understand your own. I'd say you
<br>
must do more than figure out how they're effective at organizing and getting
<br>
their message out; you must also understand the rational points in favor of
<br>
their arguments. You have to look at the situation from the opponent's point
<br>
of view and predict how they'll counter every point you'll make. At the same
<br>
time you're collecting data to support your own position, you have to look
<br>
just as diligently for data that supports the opponent's position. If
<br>
they're good, they're going to hit you with that data, and it's a lot better
<br>
to know about it in advance than to be taken by surprise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages I see [for the luddite point of view]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lie in the question of who does the talking and rule-making in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our societies...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;the media IS overwhelmingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staffed with people who lack technical or scientific education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and whose attitudes are shaped by a culture inimical to values of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress.
</em><br>
<p>I would add that most people don't know how to think logically--we've
<br>
recently discussed this in the thread having to do with education. If anyone
<br>
missed that, I'd suggest especially reading what Samantha had to say about
<br>
the difference between IQ and thinking.
<br>
<p>The media probably could not get away with the sort of rubbish that's
<br>
published if their audiences were not brain-paralyzed.
<br>
The same can be said of politicians. Their power is derived from people who
<br>
sit passively by and accept any sort of foolishness rather than risk
<br>
thinking for themselves.
<br>
<p>Given that this is the situation, you have to tailor your presentation to
<br>
get through to people who don't know much about science and who aren't used
<br>
to thinking abstractly.
<br>
<p>Greg says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... you have a deck that is stacked decidedly against rational development
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; science and technology policy.
</em><br>
<p>BUT
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...as the history of the last 250 years in the West has proven,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological business enterprises produce tangible results in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient manner that many people want and will pay for.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think this is the answer. Most people WANT the benefits of technology:
<br>
lights, heating, power tools and appliances, cars, abundant food, medical
<br>
care, youthful bodies, and so forth.
<br>
<p>Most people can't think for themselves, but they can usually follow a line
<br>
of reasoning if it's set forth step by step. And the anti-tech people have
<br>
been doing this for years.
<br>
<p>In order to make a rational counter argument, one must acknowledge that some
<br>
of what the anti-tech people say is true. Not to do so makes you look like
<br>
you're either stupid or a liar. Quality of life HAS deteriorated because of
<br>
air and water pollution and the paving over of vast amounts of land. Whole
<br>
species ARE dying off. Agriculture IS being practiced in a way that has
<br>
destroyed and continues to destroy top soil at an alarming rate--you can see
<br>
this for yourself simply by going out into a cultivated field and picking up
<br>
the cement-like clods almost entirely devoid of organic matter--and you're
<br>
not thinking things through if you counter that by saying that hydroponics
<br>
or nanotechnology will solve the problem. Along with loss of biological
<br>
diversity, there HAS been great loss of cultural diversity and great loss of
<br>
economic diversity as well. The global economy HAS killed off small
<br>
manufacturing businesses by the thousands. These particular things the
<br>
&quot;luddites&quot; say are TRUE.
<br>
<p>What is NOT true is that technology per se is to blame for the current state
<br>
of the world. The way to counter the argument that technology is bad is to
<br>
show people that there are ways of having the good without such a huge
<br>
amount of bad. One of the best ways to do this is through stories where you
<br>
can show people concrete examples of how different social systems work.
<br>
Again you come up against the separation of the sciences and the arts. Most
<br>
mainstream movies and novels I've come across lately seem to dwell on the
<br>
dangers of technology. Popular song lyrics are mostly pessimistic.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Interestingly, industries and specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enterprises that tend to make longer-term capital investments DO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more broad-based advertising.
</em><br>
<p>At the moment, advertising seems to be the only art that IS generally
<br>
optiistic with respect to technology.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Thus we see large chemical and industrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies develop and promulgate advertising campaigns and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogans that point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to longer-term progress (e.g. GE's &quot;we make good things come to light&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>But even many of these companies are taking a defensive position along the
<br>
lines of, gee guys, we're not all THAT bad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...a Carl Sagan seems to come along all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too rarely.
</em><br>
<p>OTOH, long as you're still alive, it's never too late to start learning
<br>
communications skills.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The simple facts are that the kinds of people who are drawn into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and technical fields tend to be TERRIBLE communicators in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have an impact on the culture at large.
</em><br>
<p>I wonder why this is. Wish we could talk about this on the list and figure
<br>
it out. It hasn't always been so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Even getting the people who could afford to fund the grooming of good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spokespeople to recognize the need seems to be an uphill task.
</em><br>
<p>This is something the people on this list could begin to remedy immediately.
<br>
Beginning with each person funding their own grooming (funding in terms of
<br>
time as well as money).
