<p>If Darwin thought his theory had &quot;fatal flaws&quot; he wouldn't have published his book.
<br>
Of course he never said he knew all there was to know on the subject and the
<br>
complexity of the eye did worry him because he figured 5% of an eye is useless.
<br>
However modern scientists have figured out how it must have evolved.
<br>
<p>Many simple animals have spots on their bodies that contain pigments that are
<br>
sensitive to light, they have zero resolution but they can tell day from night and
<br>
that's an advantage over a creature that can't. If the spot is in a shallow
<br>
depression in the animal's body it will have more sensitivity in one direction than
<br>
another, it will have a little bit of resolution, and that's another advantage over a
<br>
creature without that ability. The deeper the depression the better the resolution,
<br>
eventually you have a pin hole camera with excellent resolution but with terrible
<br>
sensitivity, you need a lens. A drop of water can act like a lens, much better than
<br>
a pin hole, and many animals have small glands that excrete moisture on the outside
<br>
of their skin.  If there were certain proteins in the water it could turn the water into a
<br>
colorless jelly and give it some strength, now the lens can become larger. If an animal
<br>
evolves additional muscles in that part of its body then it can quickly look at different
<br>
things without moving the entire body, a big advantage over a creature who can't.
<br>
And now you have an eyeball.
