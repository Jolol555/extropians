Jim Fehlinger &lt;<a href="mailto:fehlinger@home.com?Subject=Re:%20_2001_:%20Optimistic%20or%20pessimistic,%20en%20fin?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200102231819.LAA17052@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">fehlinger@home.com</a>&gt; gave us some lines from 2001:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Then he waited, marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untested powers.  For though he was master of the world, he was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite sure what to do next.  But he would think of something.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pure BS, to me!  Just like 100% of all science fiction
<br>
and all primitive religions too for that matter.  Every single last
<br>
bit of it stupidly wonders: &quot;what should I do next?&quot;  Duuu!  At least
<br>
the star child had enough stupid childish sense to not allow the
<br>
nuclear holocaust, evidently unlike the superiors that uplifted him.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kubrick is quoted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I think that if _2001_ succeeds at all, it is in reaching a wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectrum of people who would not often give a thought to man's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destiny, his role in the cosmos and his relationship to higher forms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does no one anywhere get it!?  Just once, I want to see an
<br>
alien movie where the evil aliens are not hiding, the stupid aliens
<br>
are not waiting, the aliens are not using some stupid excuse like the
<br>
&quot;prime directive&quot;, the aliens are not dim whitedly ignorantly
<br>
accidentally stepping on beings, or leaving one of their own kind
<br>
behind... just once I want to see aliens that can see the obvious more
<br>
than such a dim &quot;star child&quot; asking: &quot;duuu, what does I do next?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helloooo!!!!  Is anyone out there listining!!!  There is still
<br>
lots of evil down here!  We're doing all we can, spending our lives
<br>
trying to find a cure for hunger, cancer, aging, suffering... hoping
<br>
to be able to save our loved ones before they suffer more and die!!!!
<br>
Helloooo!!  In case your to dumb to figure out the obvious, we could
<br>
use some help with all this!  Screw your &quot;prime directives&quot;, your
<br>
irrational excuses for hiding and not coming down to help.  Damn your
<br>
&quot;theodicies&quot; that attempt to twist and justify your omnipotent
<br>
existence while you tolerate all this evil and suffering!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just once!  Just once!  I want to see an alien movie, or some
<br>
story about some powerful God...  That finally, after much effort,
<br>
first discovers us and with a little more than a kindergarten level of
<br>
intelligence knows just what to do (let me give you a hint.  You don't
<br>
come down and suffer and die with us on a cross.).  Just once, I want
<br>
to see these Gods mounting every resource they can muster, getting to
<br>
us as fast as they can, communicating with us as urgently as possible,
<br>
with half enough intelligence not to step on or hurt any of us (us
<br>
obviously includes all forms of life here on earth) in the effort.  I
<br>
want to see them come in with their emergency rescue ships.  I want to
<br>
see their emergency vehicle flashing lights, blaring sirens ablazing,
<br>
moving as fast as they can to save our beloved parents and brothers
<br>
and sisters that are still, despite our best efforts, SUFFERING and
<br>
DIEING!  You know, kind of the way our emergency rescue workers put
<br>
forth there best effort when someone needs it!  Just once I want to
<br>
see Gods that are caring like this and able to really help!  Just once
<br>
I want to see a happy hopeful faithful optimistic story in which evil
<br>
isn't all that powerful, necessary and impossible to overcome.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can no one realize the obvious about any kind of
<br>
relationship with any such Gods or any &quot;higher form of life&quot; and what
<br>
such a relationship ultimately must be like?  I know what I hope I
<br>
want to be doing to help when I have this kind of power!  Why does not
<br>
anyone hope that evil (as in death, suffering, separation...) will
<br>
have long since been overcome for all, long before there is anything
<br>
close to powerful Gods or ETs?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only explanation can be we are all mentally ill, a symptom
<br>
of our still dieing and suffering, such that we can't see, or we
<br>
refuse to accept, the plain, simple and obvious truth - That we all
<br>
already know what to do, as long as there is still known evil.  I
<br>
certainly optimistically hope we can overcome this insanity and
<br>
finally accept what it is we must and will ultimately do.
