<em>&gt; &gt;He's not a nihilist; he's simply following the commonest theory of

<em>&gt; &gt;rights on the planet -- one that's used by just about everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;except Americans who've been indoctrinated with their state's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;peculiar constitutional theory -- which is that rights are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;negotiated and conditional.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John Locke's &quot;Social Contract&quot;, a darn good idea, but we just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopted it. I agree with Heinlein, man has no &quot;Natural&quot; rights.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it was Rousseau who came up with the 'social contract', but
<br>
this was not a social contract of trust as I speak of in my article at
<br>
exi-freedom, but of socio-economic dependency and debt, which Bakunin
<br>
refined to include the individual's debt to the assets created by the
<br>
labor of the dead in their lifetimes.
<br>
<p>The rest of the world functions on the delusion that 'society' is some
<br>
living entity independent of the individual, and ludicrously believes
<br>
that the individual cannot survive without 'society' as if he/she were
<br>
merely a cell of the 'society' organism. The rest of the world claims
<br>
that the individuals rights are granted to it by society, with society's
<br>
sufferance, and can be rescinded as 'society' deems necessary. This is
<br>
pure fascism, simply put. It is an evolution of the old 'divine right'
<br>
principle by which kings reigned over their serfs, where there is only
<br>
one true sovereign, the king, who is now represented by the government,
<br>
which is presumed to be the thinking organ of the 'society' organism.
<br>
<p>It is not surprising that the idea of the sovereign individual is under
<br>
assault even here in the US. The last century of immigration by people
<br>
infected by socialist memes to the US has created our culture war. The
<br>
'Meme War' described by Steven Barnes in &quot;Kaleidoscope Century&quot; exists
<br>
here and now. Heinlein never said that man has no natural rights, and
<br>
his novel &quot;The Puppetmasters&quot; was an allegory to explain my argument
<br>
here. The bug parasites represent the 'society as organism' meme.
<br>
<p>Don't buy the con, Brian. Man has natural rights because he has evolved
<br>
under the laws of physics and biology to be the creature he/she is.
<br>
Natural Rights describe the evolved native capabilities of the human
<br>
animal in a state of nature. The human animal survives best when he/she
<br>
is free to communicate, associate, wonder and worship, accumulate
<br>
property, travel, and hunt and defend themself against agressors. Its
<br>
NATURAL.
<br>
<p>Nor does this mean that extropy is against natural rights, either.
<br>
Evolution is the rule, and evolution is about improvement, optimization
<br>
to the environment. As we expand our environment into space and into
<br>
cyberspace, it is our potential to evolve to survive in these
<br>
environments, and that we have the naturally evolved ability to aid in
<br>
our own evolution demonstrates this is our natural right. Those that
<br>
oppose extropy oppose natural rights.
