&quot;Combustion Models in Finance&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/physics/0101042">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/physics/0101042</a>
<br>
Combustion reaction kinetics models are used for the description
<br>
of a special class of bursty Financial Time Series.
<br>
The small number of parameters they depend upon enable
<br>
financial analysts to predict the time as well as the magnitude
<br>
of the jump of the value of the portfolio.
<br>
Several Financial Time Series are analysed within this framework
<br>
and applications are given.
<br>
<p>&quot;Physics and the stock market: playing with fire&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/news/5/1/6">http://physicsweb.org/article/news/5/1/6</a>
<br>
Financiers have long used statistics to forecast fluctuations on the stock
<br>
market, and in recent years they have also employed models from high
<br>
energy physics and statistical physics. Now two French physicists have
<br>
used theories of combustion to predict the future values of certain shares
<br>
with surprising accuracy.
<br>
Combustion often appears to occur spontaneously after a long period of
<br>
stability. Charbel Tannous and Alain Fessant of the Université de Bretagne
<br>
Occidentale in Brest recognised that this is similar to the behaviour of
<br>
some stocks that tend to jump in value suddenly after long spells of
<br>
stability - a quality known as 'burstiness'. The pair decided to apply their
<br>
knowledge of condensed matter physics to the fluctuations of the stock
<br>
market. Their findings could help market analysts to predict when stock
<br>
values will rise and fall, and by how much.
<br>
Simple models of combustion are based on changes in the concentration
<br>
of fuel over time. Ignition takes place when the fuel concentration reaches
<br>
a certain level. Tannous and Fessant modified the equations, replacing fuel
<br>
concentration by the share prices of real companies. The researchers chose
<br>
large and small companies from different industrial and economic
<br>
backgrounds, and charted the variation in their share prices over five
<br>
years.
<br>
For all six companies, the researchers found that the predictions of the
<br>
combustion-inspired model very accurately matched the actual variation in
<br>
the share price. &quot;We would be delighted if financial analysts would consider
<br>
deterministic approaches for predicting financial trends&quot;, Tannous told
<br>
PhysicsWeb. &quot;Combustion theory offers a natural framework for the
<br>
description of bursty financial time series.&quot;
<br>
According to Tannous, this is the first time that combustion models have
<br>
been used to predict the performance of companies. Tannous and Fessant do
<br>
point out, however, that after the share value has jumped, market conditions
<br>
become more important and the analogy with combustion models disappears.
<br>
<p>&quot;It seems that to some extent the laws of physics
<br>
are chosen by the universe in response to the experiments that
<br>
are done by its inhabitants, thanks to a kind of wavefunction
<br>
collapse.  When a publicly accessible causal loop is introduced
<br>
into the system, it turns out that, to avoid certain paradoxes,
<br>
the universe responds by making the laws of physics different
<br>
from the currently accepted model&quot;
<br>
-John Baez
<br>
<p>&quot;You think you are joking, but there are systems that work this way.
<br>
Take a look at the stock market (but don't look too hard it'll get you
<br>
in trouble). If anyone figures out a good theory, one that can make
<br>
predictions, look what happens. People use those predictions to make
<br>
money, sometimes at first lots of money. But then a strange thing
<br>
happens, the theory has a direct effect on the system being studied.
<br>
Say the theory correctly predicts one week in advance that a given
<br>
stock will go up %10. After the theory is discovered the stock goes up
<br>
%10 but does it one week earlier&quot;
<br>
