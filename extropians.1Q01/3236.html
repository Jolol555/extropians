Lately I have been thinking about a future without widespread nano.  Granted
<br>
nano is something I hope for...but there are lots of problems (space travel,
<br>
cryonic suspension, genetic engineering etc.) that we could solve without
<br>
it.  As a bioscience sort of guy I tend to look to the &quot;more-certain&quot;
<br>
solution, the IT and engineering types are charging after nano, if it's here
<br>
in 30 years..cool. If not..if it turns out to be a 2001 lunar colony....i
<br>
prefer to have made other arrangements.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cryonics front..neurovitrification is the no-nano-needed tech thus
<br>
far.  Frankly I like NNN tech.  It's cool.  It's conceivable.  It doesn't
<br>
involve waving a nano god-wand all around.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genetic engineering is definitely NNN tech.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next stop ..NNN borganisms.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a single individual, suitable for making a pilot project.  Use the
<br>
5-years away simple cloning tech to generate a first gen group of say five.
<br>
Use third-worlder surrogate mothers to carry the fetal clones.  You can
<br>
employ any and all en vitro enhancement techniques (the epigentic, &quot;enriched
<br>
environment&quot; toys). The best money can buy naturally.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Once your first gen is born it's best to be VERY careful about how much of
<br>
what you are doing is public knowledge.  Assuming one was in a sufficently
<br>
lawless locality other &quot;steps&quot; to ensure the collective come to mind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A conlang (similar in principle to loglan/Lojban, though aimed towards a
<br>
very different outcome) would be absolutely needed as the first native
<br>
language of the brood.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You could take advantage of the Sapir-Worf hypothesis (essentially
<br>
language shapes cognition), and structure the brood's language in such a way
<br>
that the identity barriers were intrinsically blurred.  Multiple prounouns
<br>
and careful vocabulary selection would be indicated. Inclusion of modalities
<br>
of expression such as gesture and sign &quot;phonenemes&quot;  would reinforce the
<br>
&quot;difference&quot; between the Brood and others. why force kids to make up a
<br>
secret language..give it to them. :)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You might encourage the children to think of the other Brood members as
<br>
&quot;extensions of themselves&quot; from the earliest months.  The ultimate goal here
<br>
is &quot;he looks just like me, so he is (essentially) Me&quot;.  The aims would be a
<br>
psychological gestualt, extreme empathy, and the development of
<br>
pseudotelepathy (something that seems psychic, even though it's just a
<br>
skill).  The final angle on this is sortof taboo in modern america..but you
<br>
can encourage all sorts of mindsets with the proper pharmaceuticals (another
<br>
NNN tech!) Nothing like tripping as a bonding experience.  Encouraging the
<br>
use of journals and the like to &quot;assist in the aquisition of memories housed
<br>
in adjacent neural structures&quot; would be good too.  Electronic-journals and
<br>
using the Net as a neural crutch are tools for elevating a subculture to a
<br>
true &quot;community of like minds&quot;.  How likely is it that 5+ genetically
<br>
identical individuals with IQs in the 140+ range who really think they are
<br>
pieces of the same macro-organism, won't &quot;become&quot; what they think they are.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tech advances you can deploy all new technologies into the &quot;witch's
<br>
brew&quot;.  wearables, interface tech.  it's all SO much more effective if you
<br>
are already on the &quot;same wavelength&quot; with your clan gen.   Naturally, if you
<br>
start with a decent set of genes, you can raise genius.  Then they work out
<br>
the details with the next generation. And so forth.  You attain complete
<br>
knowledge of a single individual genome and you have the knowledge you need
<br>
for the whole family..no wasteful genetic shuffling every generation, no
<br>
&quot;regression towards the norm&quot; smoothing out the precious sigmas of deviation
<br>
from the general population's intelligence level.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird thing about all this is it sounds doable...without waiting for
<br>
nano to allow you to upload or download your mind and into a waiting clone
<br>
body.  I'd much rather meet the Singularity with a half-hundred younger
<br>
selves (likely MUCH more intelligent capable selves) at my back. An if the
<br>
singularity doesn't get here anytime soon...well I'd rather have myselves
<br>
guarding my cryovault, than someone else.  At least my clones would have a
<br>
sentimental attachment to my ancient ass. You care to take odds on who would
<br>
be more likely to devitrify one of us in 200 years... society at large and
<br>
8th generation conventional descendants for you ...or a clan of selves who
<br>
&quot;know&quot; they are a lifeform that wouldn't exist without you and really want
<br>
to talk to you about how it all started?  If nothing else...it sounds like
<br>
an outstanding cryonics Trust, no?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing about this is really unorthodox, just the way it's put together.
<br>
(Sortof like extropy compared to the mainstream eh?).
<br>
<p>Anyone care to suggest some angles to incorporate into the scheme?
