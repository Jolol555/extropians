Obviously no one can take any words away from anyone, we all can choose
<br>
whatever words we wish. To clarify my point though... When using the word
<br>
extremism to refer to someone else's ideas, then 99 times out of 100 (maybe
<br>
100 times out of 100) what you are really trying to tell them is that their
<br>
ideas are not &quot;good&quot; (extremism definitely seems to have a negative
<br>
connotation) BECAUSE they are so radically different then yours (the
<br>
mainstreams, the communities, etc...) view. You don't have to address the
<br>
content of the ideas at all other then try to use an argument by
<br>
intimidation. You don't address if the ideas are actually &quot;correct&quot;. This is
<br>
why I was asking if anyone had a use of the word in any other use then the
<br>
one outlined above. If that is it's only use, then yes... I do suggest
<br>
dumping the word as anyone could use it to support &quot;any&quot; argument they
<br>
wanted for any reason just as long as they contrast against the right
<br>
concepts.
<br>
<p>Example: Transhumanist need to quiet their extremist banter about AI as the
<br>
average person certainly would think the establishment of a
<br>
hyper-intelligent race of machines on earth would be a threat.
<br>
<p>I like the idea of the uber-machines so this is just an example to
<br>
illustrate the point. :P also note, that I didn't have to bring any evidence
<br>
or facts into the sentence above, accept to show that it was an extreme view
<br>
because the mainstream didn't believe it. But see how I can throw an
<br>
additional negative word at the view even though it really doesn't matter
<br>
how many people believe in an idea? I could care less if I was the only
<br>
person in the world that believes in a particular view if I thought it was
<br>
rational and logical. I mean at one point in history, Einstein was the only
<br>
person who believed in relativity (until he told someone else about it) so
<br>
I'm just trying to illustrate that the number of people who accept an idea
<br>
is irrelevant to it's validity.

</em><br>
<p>I think that if I can't use the word to talk to somebody who uses it,
<br>
that takes a powerful communication tool away from me. If I were to rant
<br>
to that person about the word being meaningless, how far do you think
<br>
I'd get in trying to communicate?
<br>
<p>There is a real use for this word as long as people worth talking to use
<br>
it. I think Joe is worth talking to. And there is such a thing as
<br>
extreme inflexibility. Maybe *that* is what &quot;extremism&quot; is really about.
<br>
What do you make of that definition?
<br>
<p>Just thinking here.
