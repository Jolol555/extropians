</em><br>
<p>As a point of reference: the UK imprisons roughly 50% more people per
<br>
hundred thousand than ANY other country in Europe. But the USA per-capita
<br>
imprisonment rate is nearly ten times higher!
<br>
<p>Either you have an order of magnitude more violent criminals (which I
<br>
find somewhat hard to believe) or something has gone Very Wrong with
<br>
your judicial system.
<br>
<p>One possibility is that most EU countries direct some effort towards
<br>
rehabilitation of offenders; even the UK does to some extent. There
<br>
are also a range of measures short of imprisonment, and just about no
<br>
mandatory sentencing guidelines. Proposals some years ago (when Michael
<br>
Howard was Home Secretary) to abolish parole and adopt US-style mandatory
<br>
sentencing were back-pedalled on hard when it became apparent that the
<br>
prison population would double within three years (despite there being
<br>
no associated increase in crime).
<br>
<p>I figure the appropriate purpose of a judicial system is, first and
<br>
foremost, to protect the public from crimes. There are two obvious ways
<br>
of doing this:  execute everybody found guilty of anything at all, or 
<br>
take persistent lawbreakers and try to *reform* them. (Oh, and cut down
<br>
on the number of laws so that we have a legal system that everybody can
<br>
understand, abolish victimless crimes, yadda yadda -- you've heard it all
<br>
before.) Even from a utilitarian point of view, reforming people wins
<br>
hands-down over executing/imprisonment-for-life, because it returns a 
<br>
productive citizen to society rather than costing a lot and being a net
<br>
loss.
<br>
<p>So what went wrong? My guess: politicians promising to be &quot;tough on crime&quot;
<br>
because they figure that punishment (as opposed to rehabilitation) is more 
<br>
likely to win votes. If this is the case, your first step towards reducing
<br>
crime and shutting down your Gulag will be to get crime and punishment off
<br>
the political agenda as a cheap vote-winner ...
