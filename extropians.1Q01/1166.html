</em><br>
<p>**Ooh.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution is precisely *not* a theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coincidence. It's a model of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heritable random genotypic and thence phenotypic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variations subjected to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sieved, and improvements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferentially conserved. Natural *selection*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geddit?
</em><br>
<p>**I am aware of this. Try this: Where I use the word
<br>
&quot;coincidence,&quot; substitute &quot;random chance.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;well, I just don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;what to say. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;**I see intelligent direction; you see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happenstance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We both see a high degree of order. You, I gather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a Mind from outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the system intervening top-down to produce an echo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Its own order. I,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like most of the scientists in the world, see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painfully cruel accretion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization over billions of years from a state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utter noise, driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately by gravitational and other energetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradients in an expanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe.
</em><br>
<p>**Entropy is said to be the natural condition. I
<br>
suggest that Extropy requires intelligence. How we
<br>
define that may differ. I said nothing about a
<br>
top-down intervention by an intelligence residing
<br>
outside the system. The intelligence may BE the
<br>
system.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Whether or not there are ancillary aspects
<br>
<em>&gt; of the universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate conducting to spontaneous order (as, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stuart Kauffman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argues), the fact remains that darwinian selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the best available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation for the diversity of phenomena we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observe
</em><br>
<p>**Yup--which I said, more or less; defines observable
<br>
reality. This does not mean it is complete. I doubt
<br>
you really mean to suggest it is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- including, as Lee
<br>
<em>&gt; Smolin and others argue, the very features of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local universe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conduce to organic life evolving in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>**Next time you see that Darwin guy, you ask him from
<br>
me: How does your theory account for the creation of
<br>
the whole shebang? The starting kickoff?
<br>
<p>**Even assuming the theory accounts for the appearance
<br>
of life and all evolution since--the problem still
<br>
remains: order and increasing levels of apparently
<br>
self-organizing order was/were set into motion, flying
<br>
in the face of entropy--or of nothingness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This last is not an Intelligent Mind reaching out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Platoland to stir the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muck with a Finger; it's a cosmic crap shoot where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the very unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens eventually. At this enormous level, yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's happenstance. Beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, once the substrate emerges, everything is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; randomness *plus* that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ceaseless selective sieve, and the great energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradient powering it all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's difficult to grasp in this wonderful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation?
</em><br>
<p>**I grasp it just fine, thank you. which is not to say
<br>
I buy it. It's a dodge; it's hocus-pocus,
<br>
prestidigitation. A Feynman card- (or diagram-)trick,
<br>
if you will. It skirts the issue to say: 'All
<br>
possibilities are realized somewhere, somewhen. We
<br>
live in but one of an infinite number of universes,
<br>
all of which exist.' It proves nothing; it is
<br>
supposition; it absolves us of the responsibility of
<br>
devoting further thought to the matter. It is useless
<br>
and does not promote further inquiry--in fact,
<br>
discourages it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To address a general point: the Singularity talk I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gave at a university the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other day was quickly interrupted by a young man who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made somewhat similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points to yours, although he was quite proud to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; himself a creationist;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under pressure he admitted that he was a Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creationist (why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reluctance? because it showed him as a partisan).
</em><br>
<p>**I quickly point out that I am not--that in fact, the
<br>
Bible is a botched and condensed translation at least
<br>
three times removed from the original Sumerian texts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Reflecting later, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concluded that I ought to have answered him thus:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Q.  Don't forget that the *theory* of evolution is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only a *theory*, not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *fact*. Indeed, most leading scientists from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Billy-Bob College of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ineffable Knowledge have conclusively demonstrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A:  Hang on a moment. You're right - biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution is indeed `just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory' - that is, an always provisional broad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework for organizing our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many observations of the living world and allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competent scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained in the discipline to make powerful,
</em><br>
<p>**bzzzt*
<br>
<p>**Einstein was not trained as a physicist. You exclude
<br>
those not &quot;trained&quot; in the discipline. As you likely
<br>
know, many major, paradigm-shattering breakthroughs
<br>
have come from those OUTSIDE the field addressed by
<br>
the breakthrough--precisely BECAUSE those making the
<br>
suggestions (and almost invariably being ridiculed for
<br>
them--plate tectonics, anyone?) have NOT been trained
<br>
(read: indoctrinated) in the discipline affected.
<br>
They, unlike most or all of the leading thinkers IN
<br>
the discipline, have no reputation to lose
<br>
embarrassingly to the new view.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; unexpected and falsifiable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions. In the same way, the *theories* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativity (the universe at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very large, very fast scale) and quantum theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the universe at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very smallest scale) are also *theories*. They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very good theories, too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since their logic has held up extraordinarily well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under powerful attempts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to break it down, and their predictions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatedly corroborated in ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly counterintuitive to common sense, with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; startling degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accuracy to many decimal points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Creationism, on the other hand, is *not* a *theory*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a *dogma*. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the final analysis it derives its claim to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimacy not from concerted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsifiable attempts to understand the natural world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by observation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory-building and test, but directly from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purported revelation from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Supreme Being or Creator. Despite some admitted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translation hazards, its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims--drawn from a revelation given directly by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the divine to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures-- ought not be put to the test, for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be impiety.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Creation *science*, therefore, is an oxymoron, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by its own premises it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must speak the timeless and unchallengeable truth:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its proper name,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore, is Creation *Doctrine*.
</em><br>
<p>**I've never said anything about creationism being
<br>
remotely accurate or supportable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since we are discussing science rather than dogma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here today, I'm afraid we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must put your interesting religious observations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one side and proceed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the scheduled program.
</em><br>
<p>**I've also not mentioned religion, except in this
<br>
post, in response to your own references.
<br>
<p>**Einstein, however, made frequent reference to a
<br>
&quot;God.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I want to know God's thoughts, the rest are details.&quot;
<br>
<p>--Albert Einstein
<br>
<p>**And, of course, in referene to our little
<br>
discussion:
<br>
<p>**&quot;God does not play dice with the universe.&quot;
<br>
<p>Take it up with him.
