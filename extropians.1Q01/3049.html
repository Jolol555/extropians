<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think if it's administered under the Hippocratic oath or similar moral and

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ethical standards, that's different.  Administering emergency medicine to save the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life of another when they would otherwise die against their will is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; admirable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So administering LSD or other drugs to reprogram an incorrigible capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; murderer/serial killer so that they can be rehabilitated would be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; acceptable than executing them? When the alternative is execution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; re-programming is a decent alternative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A HEALTH ISSUE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly. Execution is a health issue as well, at least as far as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condemned person is concerned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It's a health issue for the species.  If a killer is in solitary confinement and will never
<br>
thus be able to kill again, then even the most sociopathic criminal might not be killed, thus
<br>
to be studied to understand future ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Citizens have rights with regards to anyone trying to &quot;reprogram&quot; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But felons are effectively 'non-citizens' in many respects. Until a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; felon is judged fit to return to society, judged to be willing and able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to participate as law abiding citizens, they shouldn't be reintroduced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; into that society. Perhaps 'reprogramming' would be acceptable to you if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it were merely a choice a prisoner could make as an alternative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; remaining in prison?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You say some felons some are not citizens, do you say they are not human?  I say they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are humans and many citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are humans, physiologically. Psychologically they may not act as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, primarily because they have not been treated humanely, but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are exceptions: Bundy, Dahmer, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Consider Mengele.  I thought about him or stories about him and felt an innate urge that his
<br>
existence was contradictory to my self-preservation.  He killed people that I never met.  If I
<br>
was a soldier in the war, I would have shot Mengele.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Reprogramming except in the context of regular education through trade skill and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; literary learning and punishments for violent behavior, should not be a focus.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sounds too cavalier to apply your meat rules to the brains of these prisoners.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then why do sexual offenders resist accepting treatment as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative to continued imprisonment after they serve their terms? They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say they LIKE feeling the way they do about the things they want to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to women and children and that they should for some reason have a right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to continue to feel that way freely on the outside after they serve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their terms. They want to commit crimes again, they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rehabilitated, and no 'vocational' learning in prison is going to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that in any way. I can understand why they resist it. I don't however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that people who are psychologically predatory on other humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be let loose at some arbitrarily decided point. They should only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be released when and if they are found competent to act as free,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law-abiding, and trustworthy citizens. If it takes treatment to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them that way, they can choose to take the treatment or stay in prison.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If, after valid psychological examination in a psychologically healthy environment, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is determined a mild sedative will help the prisoner cope with his violence issues, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that may be prescribed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does a sedative help him 'cope'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is important to counsel the inmates on a 1-1 personal basis where the inmates are epxected
<br>
to meet incremental goals or be remanded to more remedial education.
<br>
<p>It's more important to get the inmates back into functional society thus that they contribute
<br>
to the tax base of the rest of the citizens, as well as to their own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In this thread I permuted the subject to &quot;No Parole for Federales&quot; to suggest to apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the cane to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Negative re-enforcement has significant proven deterrent effects. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that kid will never steal a sign in Singapore again, don't you?
</em><br>
<p>That was so funny.
