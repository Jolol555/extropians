The following article from an Australian source points to some interesting 
<br>
moral territory that should provide fertile (ahem) grounds for social science 
<br>
reearchers.  The idea that a couple has the right to choose whether or not to 
<br>
have children is fairly well accepted in Western society (even the Vatican 
<br>
allows it's followers to abstain from reproduction if they can do it without 
<br>
&quot;artificial&quot; contraceptives).  Choosing to have children at a time and under 
<br>
circumstances in which the parents can provide optimal care for their 
<br>
offspring obviously has a great impact on the quality of life of the children 
<br>
that result.  Likewise, I don't know of anyone or any group that would 
<br>
condemn a couple from completely refraining from having children if they knew 
<br>
that their offspring would have a high likelihood of being handicapped.  Yet 
<br>
exercising that judgment at the level of selcting embryos or even gametes 
<br>
with the best chance of development into a healthy child seems to at least 
<br>
begin to cross the line for many people.
<br>
<p>Obviously, the reference to &quot;society&quot; in the comment about which the article 
<br>
below reports and the reaction to those comments provides a clue to what may 
<br>
be at least one trigger of &quot;the Eugenics Reflex&quot; so many people seem to have 
<br>
with regard to human genengineering.  In a sense, this is a sign that most 
<br>
people in the West have a healthy suspicion of social controls on human 
<br>
genengineering.  One big problem, though, is that most people seem to see the 
<br>
issues in binary terms of either 1) social DIRECTION of human genengineering 
<br>
or 2) complete prohibition.  Thank you Aldous Huxley . . . .

Fury at genetic selection remarks
<br>
By Science Writer MARK STEENE
<br>
22feb01
<br>
<p>ONE of Australia's leading geneticists has sparked outrage among disability
<br>
groups by claiming society would be better off without handicapped people.
<br>
<p>Professor Grant Sutherland, of the Women's and Children's Hospital, said
<br>
parents would be able to use technology gleaned from the human genome
<br>
project to test if unborn babies had inherited genetic diseases.
<br>
They would then be able to terminate the pregnancy if they wished.
<br>
<p>&quot;Anyone's who's born like that we have to deal with, we have to deal with
<br>
compassion, with understanding,&quot; Professor Sutherland, who led the
<br>
Australian research effort into the ground-breaking project, told the ABC's
<br>
7.30 Report on Tuesday night.
<br>
<p>&quot;But, if we can prevent the birth of handicapped individuals, then I think
<br>
that society will be better off.&quot;
<br>
<p>Disability campaigners and support groups yesterday said his comments
<br>
smacked of eugenics, the science of improving offspring.
<br>
<p>Helen Meekosha, senior lecturer at the school of social work at the
<br>
University of NSW, said she was shocked and disappointed by the professor's
<br>
comments.
<br>
<p>Ms Meekosha, who has multiple sclerosis, is in Adelaide as a speaker at the
<br>
Fourth Australian Women's Health Conference.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sutherland's comments demand that we, as a society, question who has the
<br>
right to exist and who doesn't,&quot; she said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Making a comment like that suggests society doesn't want them (handicapped
<br>
people) - that they're in some way costing society.&quot;
<br>
<p>Carolyn Frohmader, executive director of Women with Disabilities Australia,
<br>
was sickened by Professor Sutherland's comments.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is alarming that this man, whose research was the only Australian
<br>
contribution to the human genome project, can make such a discriminatory,
<br>
value-laden statement,&quot; she said.
<br>
<p>&quot;That somehow he has the right to decide who can and can't be born.&quot;
<br>
<p>Professor Sutherland, who agreed disabled people have all the rights of
<br>
able-bodied people, yesterday said it was not for him to decide if a
<br>
pregnancy should be terminated, and the technology merely provided a basis
<br>
for parents to make a decision.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's not my decision at all - it would be totally inappropriate for it to
<br>
be my decision,&quot; he said.
