<p>He replies to a critical comment I sent him:
<br>
<p>==============
<br>
<p>I found out only after I wrote the
<br>
paper that certain geometries exhibit repulsive Casimir forces. For
<br>
example, two hollow hemispheres brought together are repelled,
<br>
not attracted. But I figured out why that was so. If the ZPF theory
<br>
is correct -- as I suspect it is -- then as you bring the hemispheres
<br>
together, the ZPF radiation inside them bounces off the inside of
<br>
one hemisphere and into the inside of the other, and back again and
<br>
again until it gets completely absorbed (as *eventually* it must be).
<br>
But this actually serves to *increase* the radiation pressure inside
<br>
the hemispheres, as compared to the outside. The ZPF radiation
<br>
outside, once it bounces off the outside of each hemisphere, goes
<br>
away, never to return: only fresh ZPF radiation serves to bring the
<br>
two hemispheres together. So the inside of the hemispheres bene-
<br>
fits not only from freshly-created ZPF radiation -- which is being
<br>
created all the time -- but also to some extent from reflected radia-
<br>
tion: radiation, that is, which was created a few instances earlier.
<br>
(We're talking about periods of time too tiny to measure, natu-
<br>
rally.) And of course, even if both hemispheres are brought com-
<br>
pletely together, the space inside them still remains large enough to
<br>
allow fairly long wavelengths of ZPF radiation to form.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, when flat plates are pushed together, the space
<br>
between them decreases uniformly, and the wavelengths of ZPF
<br>
radiation get more and more restricted. Eventually hardly any ZPF
<br>
radiation exists between them, while the ZPF radiation outside
<br>
them is undiminished. This explains the difference between the
<br>
Casimir effect on flat plates as opposed to two hollow hemi-
<br>
spheres.
<br>
<p>As for the exact solutions for Casimir forces for adjacent spheres,
<br>
that is not repulsive. But it would be, I think, erroneous to use the
<br>
theoretical (i.e., exact) figures in my paper -- at least at this stage.
<br>
The reason is that we have no knowledge of the exact shape of sub-
<br>
atomic particles, nor about their transparency or opacity. (I men-
<br>
tioned this to some extent in my paper.)
<br>
<p>My paper tries as a first attempt to think up what must logically
<br>
happen if the ZPF theory is correct. As I wrote, if there is any
<br>
ZPF at all, there must be *some* effect of the ZPF on the nucleus,
<br>
and on the proton and quark: just what that effect is may not be
<br>
known theoretically and it may be necessary to conduct experi-
<br>
ments to find it out, but that there *must* be some effect cannot be
<br>
possibly be denied -- if, of course, the ZPF exists at all.
<br>
<p>=======================
<br>
<p>to which I responded:
<br>
<p>=======================
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My paper tries as a first attempt to think up what must logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happen if the ZPF theory is correct. 
</em><br>
<p>That's what I liked.
<br>

<p>Well, assuming you're not making the, ahem, vulgar error of imputing
<br>
qualities to the quantal world that are inappropriate there--billiard ball
<br>
partons, say. In places you acknowledge that the fundamental thingees are
<br>
probabilistic and blurry, in some respects, but your central model is kinda
<br>
Newtonian. Well, maybe that's true, but I think Heisenberg smashes the
<br>
balls. Unless that's just a computational artifact created by stochastic
<br>
ZPF zitterbewegung.
<br>
<p>But what would I know? :)
