<p><em>&gt; Frivolous lawsuits in the US are just plain destruction of property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You take your pile of money and then go cancel out someone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  pile of money, creating three losers: the plaintiff, the defendant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and the people in the US who deserve a better justice system - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you get two winners: the plaintiff's attorneys and the defendant's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  attorneys.
</em><br>
<p>Yes - &quot;frivolous lawsuits&quot; are by definition wasteful.  A legal system that
<br>
functions well has mechanisms for shutting such suits down in their early
<br>
stages, before they cause unnecessary costs to defendants who shouldn't have
<br>
to go through the full litigation process.  In fact, such mechanisms still
<br>
work quite well in the vast majority of suits.
<br>
<p>When thinking about how the legal system in the US works, consider that good
<br>
information about the system does not make its way into the consciousness of
<br>
population at large through the mainstream media.  As I have explained here
<br>
before, newspapers and television networks make money by selling sensation,
<br>
and the fact that a frivolous suit has been dismissed in its early stages
<br>
isn't considered to be &quot;news&quot;.
<br>
<p>What in fact happens in the vast majority of cases is this.  A class action
<br>
suit is filed.  The plaintiffs' lawyer sends a copy of the petition to lots
<br>
of reporters.  They read the inflammatory allegations and the huge figure
<br>
cited in the petition as the damages claimed by the plaintiff.  This gets
<br>
reported as &quot;GIANT COMPANY, INC. FACES FIVE BILLION DOLLAR SUIT&quot;.  When the
<br>
case is dismissed three months later on a motion to dismiss on the pleadings
<br>
or a motion for summary judgment, Giant Co.'s publicist can't interest the
<br>
mainstream media in the story.  If it gets reported, it shows up as a tiny
<br>
item on the back pages of the business section.
<br>
<p>A recent example of this is the life and death of the silicone breast
<br>
implant
<br>
litigation.  The cases were big news when they were started.  What has been
<br>
grossly under-reported is that the litigation has completely fizzled out as
<br>
the science has slowly but surely shown that there was ZERO factual basis
<br>
for
<br>
these suits.  The big-time (and very talented) plaintiffs' lawyers who were
<br>
pushing this litigation three years ago have been bailing out in droves now
<br>
that that the results in court aren't justifying the huge cost of
<br>
maintaining
<br>
the litigation machine they had to build and run to keep the suits going.
<br>
<p>Again, let me stress the positive effects of the &quot;private policing&quot; function
<br>
that plaintiffs' lawyers serve in our system.  I watched &quot;Erin Brokavitch&quot;
<br>
this weekend, fully expecting to hate it (not least of which because I've
<br>
had
<br>
the consistent opinion that Julia Roberts was a no-talent &quot;celebrity&quot;).  I
<br>
was pleasantly surprised.  Although the screenplay does cut some corners
<br>
with
<br>
legal technicalities and tends toward a fairly shallow characterization of
<br>
the &quot;Bad Guys&quot;, it does preserve the essential logic of how a MERITORIOUS
<br>
toxic-tort &quot;mass-action&quot; is developed and run in a system of private
<br>
prosecution.  Especially well explained in the film's plot is how the
<br>
plaintiffs' lawyers have to shoulder personal financial, professional and
<br>
emotional risk in the process during its very expensive early stages.  (And,
<br>
I have to admit, Julia Roberts does a superb acting job in the film.)  I
<br>
HIGHLY commend the film to both Americans and non-Americans as a good lesson
<br>
of how the system works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  As I understand it, the British use more of a &quot;winner takes all&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  method in deciding legal disputes.  Is that correct?  Although I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not real hip on the wigs, I think that we could do well to adopt some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of those methods.
</em><br>
<p>That's right.  The system in the UK is traditionally &quot;winner takes all&quot; (and
<br>
is therefore called &quot;the English system&quot; in US jurisprudence) and, while
<br>
that
<br>
serves as a STRONG incentive against frivolous lawsuits, it also acts as a
<br>
disincentive to the kind of private policing the US system encourages.
<br>
There
<br>
has also been a traditional antipathy in the UK to contingency fees, which
<br>
has the same positive and negative impact on their legal system.
<br>
Interestingly, a system of private insurance against the liability for the
<br>
other side's legal fees has developed in the UK, which has somewhat served
<br>
to
<br>
create a private market in legal claims, as the contingency fee system does
<br>
in the US.  Under that system, a plaintiff and her lawyer can interest
<br>
private insurance underwriters in a  claim, which allows the insurers to in
<br>
essence &quot;invest&quot; in your suit through taking premiums, which is functionally
<br>
equivalent to the way a plaintiffs' lawyer does in the US.
<br>
<p>Also, note that US law has adopted the &quot;English rule&quot; rule in many kinds of
<br>
cases.  Attorneys fees are routinely ganted as an element of damages in
<br>
contract cases in the US under various state statutes.  Even in tort cases,
<br>
there are mechanisms for recovery of one's own attorneys fees (although I
<br>
won't go into the significant complexity of how that's done).
<br>
<p>As for the wigs, I personally think they're a good idea.  They tend to
<br>
signify the solemnity and importance of what's being done - something we
<br>
could use more of in the US, I think.
