<p><em> &gt; &gt; I have to say I don't really understand this paranoia of yours.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Its not paranoia when it actually happens to many people,
</em><br>
<p>I apologize if I was teasing too far. I don't know what actually happens in
<br>
your country, other than that I constantly watch your films, news and
<br>
talk-shows and read your newspapers. Yes well, basically, these are the same
<br>
sources of information that you have - but still, I believe you scrutinize
<br>
facts like these much more carefully than I do.
<br>
<p>[Note to Michael: please make sure to read the second half of the message. I
<br>
am looking forward to your rebuttal regarding what I found your statistics
<br>
to be. Hint: 'made up' would be a very kind expression for what you tried to
<br>
pull off.]
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; Yes, I understand this was also the case in 1938 in some
</em><br>
<em> &gt; countries. Lets see, you are in Slovenia, according to whois.net,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; which is a former Yugoslav republic. Hmmmm, no, I'm sure every
</em><br>
<em> &gt; person killed in your country definitely needed to be killed.
</em><br>
<p>;-)
<br>
<p>Yes, in 1945, the socialist government killed mercilessly thousands of
<br>
people who weren't friends with the new forces that be. Later on, they were
<br>
quick to brand you as an &quot;enemy of the state&quot; if you showed the least sign
<br>
of a liberal outlook on life, and they put you away to &quot;Naked Island&quot;, a
<br>
small island in the Adriatic. Just a couple of hundred meters from shore,
<br>
but incredibly difficult to escape from because of the strong currents. Many
<br>
people spent decades on that island, and many more died there, too.
<br>
<p>They did all this stuff. We separated from Yugoslavia in 1990, had a short
<br>
10 day 'war' in which something like 8 Slovenians and something like 100
<br>
Yugo soldiers were killed, and now we're on our own.
<br>
<p>Since then, I have had little complaints with the government, other than
<br>
that taxes are enormous. I've been involved in a few driving misdeeds in the
<br>
past 10 years, such as dangerous overtaking, and I have to say the police
<br>
have always treated me well. No handcuffs or going to jail for 30 days.
<br>
Sure, I've heard about some of our policemen beating the hell out of a
<br>
(relatively) innocent guy, and I'd like to have them more than just
<br>
reprimanded for that. But overall they're quite alright.
<br>
<p>I think you would have liked this country if you ever came to visit. [But
<br>
make sure you deposit your money in Switzerland, you don't want to pay a 50%
<br>
income tax. ;-) ]
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; No european nation has any right to claim they are
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in any way more peaceful or safer. The odds of a european
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dying from gun fire is about a hundred times higher than
</em><br>
<em> &gt; for any American.
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to hear where you got these numbers from, and what part of Europe
<br>
they refer to.
<br>
<p>I had some difficulty verifying your claims. I visited the website of our
<br>
Ministry for Internal Affairs, and they say we had something less than 200
<br>
criminal acts involving arms in 1998. That translates to 0.0001 such act per
<br>
citizen per year. The number of such criminal acts involving firearms (not
<br>
arms in general) should be significantly lower.
<br>
<p>The number of murders in 1996 (couldn't find data for 1998) was 34, and most
<br>
murders around here don't involve firearms.
<br>
<p>So, I guess overall not less than 10 and not more than 30 people die from a
<br>
bullet around here each year. That gives a probability range of 1:66666 to
<br>
1:200000. That corresponds to some data I found on
<br>
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ears5/handouts/Prob_dying6_25_99.html">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ears5/handouts/Prob_dying6_25_99.html</a>, which says
<br>
the probability of death by homicide in Europe in any year is 1:100000.
<br>
<p>And what do you have?
<br>
<p>Ah-ha, let me see. Here it is, Bureau of Justice Statistics. Homicide
<br>
Trends. Weapons Trends. Look'n'look: &quot;Homicides are most often comitted with
<br>
guns, usually handguns.&quot; If you trust me to read that graph correctly, there
<br>
were something like 7000 homicides with firearms in 1999 in USA.
<br>
<p>Hint: that's a probability of 1:40000 at best.
<br>
<p>So, Europe is one hundred times as dangerous as the US, right? Yeah.
<br>
<p>Who is it that has been making up their statistics? You or me?
