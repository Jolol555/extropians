</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I find it very interesting, that the Californians have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very nasty habit of exporting their problems to Washington
</em><br>
<p>Let me clarify that the &quot;cap&quot; is actually a freeze and was intended as
<br>
a floor, not a ceiling for prices, at which it succeeded for the first
<br>
two years.  The utilities wanted a protected profit margin and since
<br>
at the time costs were running below prices (which is what motivated
<br>
deregulation), freezing prices was their idea.  Then a year ago everything
<br>
went topsy-turvy, costs rose above still-frozen prices and the utilities
<br>
are now one step from bankruptcy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tossed off Robert's point with a distracting riff about singalongs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but he makes a good argument, to which I do not know the answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have a curious uxtaposition of free market, state and local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government.  For instance, we do welfare on a state level,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote on power plants on a county level and kinda sorta let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free markets determine the price of gas but not electricity.
</em><br>
<p>Free markets are determining the &quot;wholesale&quot; but not the &quot;retail&quot; price
<br>
of as in California, which is the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The upshot is, the economically overcooked SF Bay area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is clearly exporting its problems.  San Jose is home to large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers of power hungry server farms.  Logical place for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them because they dont really take up much expensive room,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but use a lot of power, which is subsidized!  The Taxifornia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state government wont pull the plug, since they continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to calmly collect 1.28% annual tax on all the ridiculously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overpriced Silicon Valley real estate, as well as a cool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 11% income tax on all these juicy 6 digit incomes, in addition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the 7.8% sales tax.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we should consider it &quot;problem exporting&quot; when some region
<br>
consumes more than it produces of a resource.  After all, that's what
<br>
trade is for.  For almost every resource and every region, there will
<br>
not be a perfect balance of production and consumption.
<br>
<p>However electricity can be expensive to transport.  Along with the
<br>
well known shortful in electricity production growth, there are also
<br>
limitations in the carrying capacity of the major transmission lines,
<br>
which are making it difficult to transport electricity into northern
<br>
California.  That's what caused most of the blackouts last month.  There
<br>
was electricity available but they couldn't get it into the Bay area.
<br>
<p>The real problem is that the growth in California's economy was not
<br>
properly anticipated.  You can point fingers where you like, but the
<br>
benefits of our hindsight were not available in the past.  Who can tell
<br>
us today how much electricity California will be consuming 5 years
<br>
from now?  Are we going to regret the long term contracts which are
<br>
being negotiated today, at prices which would have seemed outrageously
<br>
high three years ago?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Santa Clara county is laughably overheated economically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The result is there is no low-cost housing, so there are few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if any poor people.  When one pays thousands per month
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in taxes, one does not *care* if the power bill is 50 or 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or 300 a month, its all down in the noise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consequently, Santa Clara county consistently votes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; export power plants, and the long term result is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost of power goes up for everyone.  Even if free markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevail and voters were not consulted, Santa Clara county
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *still* wouldnt have power plants built on it, for the ground
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is far too expensive for utilities.
</em><br>
<p>It's often reasonable to avoid building power plants near fast-growing
<br>
areas.  It's better in many ways to put them out where nobody lives.
<br>
Leave the land near the city to be used for homes, parks, offices.
<br>
But you then have to pay the costs of transporting the power.
<br>
<p>There are two separate issues here.  One is the difficulty of getting power
<br>
into specific regions due to line congestion.  The other is the increased
<br>
demand for power which is driving up market prices.  The former relates to
<br>
localized NIMBYism but only hurts the communities which push the plants away.
<br>
The latter is a large-scale problem and hurts everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whats the fair way to determine where power plants go? spike
</em><br>
<p>This is probably not quite the right question; you want to ask, what
<br>
is the most cost-effective and efficient mechanism for locating power
<br>
plants.  I suspect part of the problem is that the local decision making
<br>
authorities don't reap enough economic rewards from allowing plants
<br>
to be built in their area.  NIMBYism would turn around if people got a
<br>
share of the riches from the facilities built in their back yards.
