<em>&gt; &gt; 31 years living in the US I have only heard gunfire on the streets of any city I have been in on 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; occasions, and I have always lived in large cities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I lived in Washington, DC, on the 900 block of S street NW for about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year. (A few blocks from the 930 club.) Late night gun shots were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common occurence (every few days). Only time I was at all nerved was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when someone emptied his clip all at once. It all depends on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhood; I lived near Dupont Circle for several months and never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard a gunshot.
</em><br>
<p>The guns heard where I am are recreational shooters: hunters, target
<br>
shooters, and backyard plinkers. It unnerves city folk who move here,
<br>
who have the impression that coming here will give them peace and quiet,
<br>
and are very angry when they don't get it (some idiots even want to
<br>
force the airport to not allow any takeoffs or landings at night), yet
<br>
they never do due diligence to find out if there is a gun club near
<br>
their homes, and become rather perturbed when their complaints to police
<br>
about a neighbor shooting the crows or pigeons out of his barn or
<br>
cornfields are laughed at by dispatchers. 
<br>
<p>When I hear a gun go off, my immediate reaction is not &quot;heads down&quot;, its
<br>
&quot;I hope they got one!&quot; (deer, bird, rabbit, target).
<br>
<p>City people move up here, buy land, then immediately post it against
<br>
hunters, yet get annoyed when the deer population explodes and they
<br>
total a car every year in collisions with deer on the road. They let
<br>
their dogs run free in the winter and get annoyed when the dog is shot
<br>
while chasing deer, while at the same time they feed deer in the winter
<br>
which only aids their overpopulation and freak out when deer die from
<br>
sickness and malnutrition from being chased by their dogs to the point
<br>
of exhaustion. They go hiking in the woods in the fall with white and
<br>
brown clothing on, and/or else they freak out when they come across
<br>
armed hunters in the woods, paranoically feeling like they've stumbled
<br>
into a war zone in their backyards.
<br>
<p>They then get active in local government to try to turn our community
<br>
into the sort of hellhole they tried to escape from.
