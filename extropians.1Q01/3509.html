<p>Dear Josh,
<br>
<p>Practice.
<br>
Practice.
<br>
Practice.
<br>
<p>Start with a technical writing class, and then find ways to fit
<br>
writing into your current work. In between:
<br>
<p>Practice.
<br>
Practice.
<br>
Practice.
<br>
<p>Then, after some years of practicing and gaining confidence, find
<br>
some small newsletters that will pay you something (small) and work
<br>
your way up to larger magazines.
<br>
<p>I think popular science writing is **mega-fun**. I would probably do
<br>
it all of the time, if I didn't _also_ love astronomy research and
<br>
I didn't have my RSI-limited hands.
<br>
<p><p>My path went this way:
<br>
In 1989, I had the good fortune to be required to take a scientific
<br>
writing class at San Jose State U to complete my MS Physics degree.
<br>
For six months we rewrote scientific and popular articles; rewriting
<br>
them to be clearer, and learning specific aspects of &quot;connecting&quot;
<br>
the sentences, connecting the paragraphs, being concise, etc. Some
<br>
of our hardest assignments were to explain a physics concept without
<br>
the use of scientific jargon (hah! I dare you to try explaining how
<br>
a boomerang works...) I strongly suggest that you begin with such a
<br>
class. It will give you the most important basics.
<br>
<p>I applied some of those skills to writing tasks (computer user
<br>
instructions, other instructions) at my NASA-Ames job. Then in '94,
<br>
I quit my job and became an &quot;astronomy consultant&quot;, and offered
<br>
&quot;technical writing&quot; among my services to clients. After that, I
<br>
found myself &quot;the communications&quot; person for our Stanford solar
<br>
physics group, teaching the public about helioseismology, answering
<br>
children's  &quot;Ask a Solar Physicist&quot; questions. In Germany, as a PhD
<br>
researcher (almost completed my dissertaion), I don't have as much
<br>
time, but people now _pay_ me to write about science, which tickles
<br>
me to death, and I like it so much that I still write a couple
<br>
popular science articles a year.  (Plus I'm the only native English
<br>
speaker in my research group, which means that everyone brings their
<br>
scientific articles to me to proof)
<br>
<p>Here's something you can do now: USE USENET
<br>
<p>* Find interesting posts on the scientific newsgroups on the
<br>
Internet. (Unfortunately, Usenet has gotten more and more trashy the
<br>
last years, so the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot; questions are harder to
<br>
find.)
<br>
<p>* Then answer those questions, giving them alot of attention. my
<br>
above comments, i.e. explaining with a minimum of jargon. Keep
<br>
rewriting and rewriting to make the answer clear and concise. Over
<br>
time, it will get easier for you, and give you confidence.
<br>
<p>It's easy.. it's fun.. I'm sounding like a salesperson, I know. I would
<br>
dearly love to see more well-written popular science articles and
<br>
books, so I am happy to offer advice.
<br>
