<p>Roger that.  Taxifornia didnt really deregulate the industry.  By
<br>
keeping regulations on the prices power companies could charge,
<br>
and by the regulation on new power stations, which is in effect
<br>
controlling the supply, the Taxifornia government demonstrated
<br>
ignorance of the most basic laws of macroeconomics.  By controlling
<br>
both the supply and price, they are now reduced to a pathetic
<br>
effort to urge people to use less, which is a feeble attempt to
<br>
control demand!  Of course that will fail.  Anyone who is tempted
<br>
to vote for Davis for president in 04 or 08, please remember this
<br>
incident.  spike
