<em>&gt;In short--it ain't in the near-term cards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You can show a 90% cost reduction, maybe someone will be interested,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maybe not.
</em><br>
<p>There was a very good Scientific American last year where they 
<br>
discussed various strategies under development that would lower the 
<br>
per Kg costs of getting payloads to space by orders of magnitude. 
<br>
Sorry, I don't have a reference to the issue.
<br>
<p>One of the most interesting technologies was a ground based laser 
<br>
that would fire up into the launch vehicle, super-heating the air 
<br>
until it was able to explosively propel the vehicle up up up.  They 
<br>
had working models and were gradually getting the things to go higher 
<br>
and higher.
<br>
<p>I'm reminded of the Internet.  Back in the late 80's, I was using the 
<br>
Internet at college for emailing friends in Europe, playing MUDs, 
<br>
downloading software, etc.  I thought it was the greatest thing, and 
<br>
one of my biggest regrets was that I wouldn't have access to it after 
<br>
I graduated.  I worked for the IT department at school and I knew 
<br>
that it cost the school tens of thousands of dollars a month to have 
<br>
that connection.  I just couldn't imagine how the economies of scale 
<br>
would ever allow me to have my own personal Internet connection.
<br>
<p>In less than a decade, as we all know, corporate interests in the 
<br>
Internet changed everything.  What used to seem impossible is now 
<br>
commonplace.
<br>
<p>I think that the same thing will happen with the space industry. 
<br>
Some people will keep chipping away at technologies to get us into 
<br>
space cheaper and cheaper.  Then, one day, some corporation will find 
<br>
a way to exploit something in space for a profit - maybe weightless 
<br>
fabrication, or mining asteroids, or something not yet imagined (as 
<br>
the web was not yet imagined in the late 80's).  From there, you'll 
<br>
see this corporate explosion into space, and economies of scale will 
<br>
make it so affordable that even private citizens of modest means will 
<br>
be able to take advantage of it.
<br>
<p>As with the Internet - in a decade or two our whole world will have 
<br>
changed.  You'll look back and wonder how we ever got by without 
<br>
affordable space travel.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
