</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that the philosophy above could use the word &quot;discipline&quot; a couple 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of times.  Respecting a child as an intelligent human being is certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important, but just like in adult life, children need to come up against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hard realities that demand self-control.
</em><br>
<p>You'd be surprised at how rationally children behave when they're give the 
<br>
opportunity. I can't see why a child would NEED to come up against hard 
<br>
realities. Sometimes the hard realities can't be avoided, but it seems very 
<br>
strange to wish them upon your child or anyone else you love. Do you really 
<br>
believe that you need to come up against hard realities? What sort of hard 
<br>
realities do you need to come up against?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   And yes, sometimes, baby has to be left in her crib to cry for a few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minutes before she falls asleep.
</em><br>
<p>No, baby does not HAVE to be left in her crib to cry. This is something you 
<br>
choose to do to her.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You can't tell a child that he got an answer wrong.  You can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discipline a child for bad behavior.  You can't determine a curriculum, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the children have to be allowed to &quot;figure out what they want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't know much about Northern California public schools except for a 
<br>
small school in Whitethorn in Mendicino County. Letting the kids take part 
<br>
in designing their own curricula seemed to work very well; there was a high 
<br>
level of parental involvement, and the kids seemed interested in what they 
<br>
were doing. Some friends of mine sent their daughters to high school in San 
<br>
Francisco after they'd gone through 9th grade in Whitethorn, and they did 
<br>
fine--they didn't seem to be disadvantaged in any way from having attended 
<br>
a school where they were allowed freedom to learn what interested them. (I 
<br>
believe they WERE required to pass certain state tests for standard stuff 
<br>
such as reading and math skills--is this not the case for all CA schools?)
<br>
<p>I've worked briefly in a public school system here in Texas. My role was to 
<br>
work with children who had &quot;behavioral problems.&quot; Here's how the &quot;normal&quot; 
<br>
classroom was set up: 25 or 30 kids were made to sit still for hours at a 
<br>
time listening to a lecture that was dumbed down so that the least 
<br>
intelligent kids could understand it. The teacher would go over the same 
<br>
material several times. The smarter kids were horribly bored but were not 
<br>
allowed to study on their own. Instead, they must sit still and pretend to 
<br>
listen. Naturally, they fidgeted, drew pictures in their books, talked to 
<br>
their neighbors. Naturally, this irritated the teacher, whose performance 
<br>
was judged in part by her ability to keep order in the classroom. The 
<br>
teacher wasn't allowed to discipline them. Instead, they were sent to 
<br>
&quot;in-school suspension&quot; where they were made to do the most tedious tasks 
<br>
imaginable, such as adding up long columns of numbers. If they fidgeted 
<br>
they were locked in a closet. I understand from talking to others around 
<br>
the US that this is SOP nowadays.
<br>
<p>Most of the kids weren't interested in what they were being taught in the 
<br>
school room, and they would probably never use any of it in their lives 
<br>
outside the school room.  But the purpose of school was not to learn 
<br>
anything useful. Rather it was to keep the kids off the streets and out of 
<br>
the adults' way (and, when they're high school age, out of the labor 
<br>
market)  When I interacted with these kids (even the &quot;dumb&quot; ones) one to 
<br>
one or in small groups, they almost invariably proved to be very adept at 
<br>
learning things they were interested in and had some use for knowing, the 
<br>
young ones did anyhow. As they get older, though, many of them seem to 
<br>
learn hopelessness and lose any desire to learn.
<br>
<p>I think rather than more discipline, what's needed is for people to 
<br>
understand the learning and thinking process and to acknowledge that 
<br>
learning and thinking cannot be forced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My wife and I also studied the breast feeding issue before our daughter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was born.  Everything we read indicated that breast feeding is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no-brainer choice, in terms of convenience, nutrition, and transfer of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immunity - but everything we read and heard from health professionals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indicated that anything beyond 9 months to a year was unproven to have any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extra benefits, physiologically or psychologically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'd be interesting in seeing any scientific evidence that the 3-5 year 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure that you mention above has any advantages.
</em><br>
<p>Here's an excerpt from an article by Katherine A. Dettwyler, PhD. Abstract 
<br>
with references at <a href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/BA/Aug94p3.html">http://www.lalecheleague.org/BA/Aug94p3.html</a>
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Our evolutionary past has produced an organism that relies on 
<br>
breastfeeding to provide the context for physical, cognitive, and emotional 
<br>
development. The non-human primate data suggest that human children are 
<br>
designed to receive all of the benefits of breast milk and breastfeeding 
<br>
for an absolute minimum of two and a half years, and an apparent upper 
<br>
limit of around seven years. Natural selection has favored those infants 
<br>
with a strong, genetically coded blueprint that programs them to expect 
<br>
nursing to continue for a number of years after birth and results in the 
<br>
urge to suckle remaining strong for this entire period. Many societies 
<br>
today are able to meet a child's nutritional needs with modified adult 
<br>
foods after the age of three or four years. Western, industrialized 
<br>
societies can compensate for some (but not all) of the immunological 
<br>
benefits of breastfeeding with antibiotics, vaccines, and improved 
<br>
sanitation. But the physical, cognitive, and emotional needs of the young 
<br>
child persist.
<br>
Health care professionals, parents, and the general public should be made 
<br>
aware that somewhere between three and seven years may be a reasonable and 
<br>
appropriate age of weaning for humans, however uncommon it may be in the 
<br>
United States to nurse an infant through toddlerhood and beyond.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   I'd certainly be willing to change my mind on the subject given some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence, but currently, I find a 5 year old tugging on his mom's bra to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get a quick bite to eat to be more of a potential problem than a gain.
</em><br>
<p>My child weaned herself at the age of four after tapering off gradually. 
<br>
But I certainly never had problems with her tugging at my clothing. Once 
<br>
she learned to understand English I explained to her that in the time and 
<br>
place we inhabited nursing in public was considered impolite. She 
<br>
understood this by the time she was a little over a year old. Contrary to 
<br>
(what seems to be) popular belief, children are not irrational monsters who 
<br>
get their kicks by harassing their parents. When they're babies, they don't 
<br>
cry just for the hell of it. They cry because they need something and are 
<br>
not yet able to get it for themselves (how would YOU feel if you couldn't 
<br>
walk or talk and you were thirsty or hungry or lonely or scared or had 
<br>
dirty pants and people just ignored you? Not too good, I'll bet)  Taking 
<br>
care of a child's needs when she's little seems to result in a capable, 
<br>
independent, compassionate older child. I encourage you to take a look at 
<br>
Sarah Lawrence's web site, maybe subscribe to her mailing list for a while. 
<br>
Talk to some of the other parents who are raising their kids 
<br>
non-coercively. David Deutsch (who wrote *The Fabric of Reality* often 
<br>
takes part in the discussions as well.
