<em>&gt;  &gt;My take on &quot;extremism&quot; is that extremists try to go as far as possible in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one direction or the other.  I think the real answer is always somewhere in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the middle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe I have this wrong, but are we suggesting that the guiding principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for making decisions is to be its placement on the scale of popular beliefs?
</em><br>
<p>No.  My post may not have been clear enough, because you have totally 
<br>
misunderstood my posting.  You misread me as advocating a compromise 
<br>
position in the middle to avoid being combative.  You repeated this 
<br>
many times in your post.  This is wrong.  I never took this position. 
<br>
I actually agree with all your points and examples that you gave in 
<br>
response to my post!
<br>
<p>My claim is that a non-extremist is someone who takes ANY position. 
<br>
Even a strong liberal position or a strong conservative position (for 
<br>
example) is not extreme as long as one has limits on both sides. 
<br>
&quot;One position is too weak for me, whereas this other position is too 
<br>
radical, so I choose this point right here.&quot;  An extremist never 
<br>
knows when they have gone too far, because their goal is a direction, 
<br>
not a point.  No matter how far they get, they keep going further.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why not base your decisions on your rational analysis of the facts? Yes you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might come to a position that many people may not hold, but you will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been honest with yourself and not compromised your opinions for the sake of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being &quot;non-combative&quot; i.e. You want to figure out whether the 2nd amendment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is morally sound? Well read it, then read the federalist papers, then read
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything about it written by the authors (and anyone else) about why it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there. Then come to a conclusion and stand by it.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly what I was advocating.
<br>
<p>The point that you seem to have missed is that any rational position 
<br>
must be delineated on all sides.  I believe that anyone who has taken 
<br>
a stand knows exactly where there position is.  They can explain the 
<br>
limits of &quot;not enough&quot; and &quot;too much&quot; according to their position. 
<br>
The extremist believes that there can never be enough.  No matter 
<br>
what they get, they keep fighting for more.  As long as a more 
<br>
extreme position is available, they will take it.  Such a person has 
<br>
no position, but will keep moving their goals as public opinion 
<br>
shifts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;The fact of the matter is that any position can be taken to unreasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think the correct and &quot;right&quot; solution is to go to far. I cant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imagine an engineer thinking like this when building a product. Like him
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saying &quot;Steel is the hardest material we can build this bridge out of and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jell-O is the softest, lets find something in the middle to use&quot;. Just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the engineer building a product used the right material, a judge or lawyer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should use the right law to build a correct objective moral system (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alternative is a system based on the whims of the masses).
</em><br>
<p>I did not advocate the position you suggest.  Your example matches 
<br>
exactly what I am advocating.
<br>
<p>I never advocated an engineer choosing something random in the 
<br>
middle.  I advocate an engineer calculate the stress, weights and 
<br>
safety margins until an exact requirement is found.  Then the bridge 
<br>
is built to those requirements.  This is the non-extremist position. 
<br>
The extremist position would be that the bridge must be the 
<br>
strongest, biggest, safest bridge in the world.  The extremist would 
<br>
demand that no bridge be built until it is indestructible, and that 
<br>
no potholes can ever occur in any roadway or bridge.  If any 
<br>
accidents occur on any bridge, all bridges must be shutdown until 
<br>
they can be made safe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;It confuses them when they push for their solution and suddenly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they go too far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Who decides what is too far?
</em><br>
<p>The non-extremist decides for themselves by reasonable analysis what 
<br>
they consider too far.  The extremist never considers how far is far 
<br>
enough.  They keep fighting for the cause to ridiculous extremes 
<br>
because they really have not chosen a position.  They have chosen a 
<br>
cause, and will keep fighting for their cause forever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;As a self-test, I would argue that anybody who agrees with one side of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issue all the time is an extremist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think the killing of innocent people is morally wrong 100% of the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(which is different then saying I wouldn't do it. i.e. WWII was brought to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quick ending in the Pacific with the use of the nuclear bomb. It was morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong to kill those people, but in the context of the war, more innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people would have died if it wasn't done). So context is key here.
</em><br>
<p>I think your words support my position.  Although you started to give 
<br>
an extreme example that is right 100% of the time, you already 
<br>
pointed out the exceptions, considerations, reasons why you would 
<br>
take a lessor position in some cases.  Thus, you are not an 
<br>
extremist.  If you were, you would have argued that the bomb should 
<br>
not have been used until we could guarantee that not a single 
<br>
innocent person was harmed.
<br>
<p>I think we seem to agree much more than your original reading of my 
<br>
posting suggested.  Where you disagreed, it was to a position that I 
<br>
had not actually taken.  Where you gave examples, I agreed with your 
<br>
points.  My original post may not have been clear enough, hence the 
<br>
confusion.  Your points seem agreeable to me.
