<em>&gt;Gosh.  The notion that total crime rate (or other social indicators) in a

</em><br>
<p><p>Assuming the distribution of predispositions in a population is roughly 
<br>
constant, and assuming that the population lives in a free society, the net 
<br>
result should be a fairly stable equilibrium of criminal activity.  The 
<br>
more non-free a society higher the deviation that is likely to occur from 
<br>
the equilibrium state.  It is not strictly zero-sum in an absolute sense, 
<br>
but it is useful to view it that way, particularly if you are a proponent 
<br>
of a free society (which does approximate a zero sum game over time).
<br>
<p>Note that the overall crime rates for a given population tends to be flat 
<br>
over time; only the distribution throughout the population 
<br>
changes.  Substantial changes in overall crime rates, for better or worse, 
<br>
can be attributed to changes in the level of oppression or changes in the 
<br>
makeup of the population.  Or at least, I can't think of case where crime 
<br>
rates have changed significantly where there wasn't a signficant change in 
<br>
the level of individual freedom.  Freedom in this context should include 
<br>
cultural and social factors, not just governmental ones.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Given that education, housing, income level disparity, presence of jobs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environmental factors in rearing, etc... can all affect the propensity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;towards crime, it would seem that this is far from a zero-sum system.
</em><br>
<p><p>Chicken and egg.  You are citing effects as causes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There are real benefits to be had, for example, by ensuring a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quality education for residents of an area.
</em><br>
<p><p>As someone who lived and went to school in the really bad part of town, I 
<br>
know that it is quite possible to get an education that is just as good as 
<br>
what you get in the &quot;good&quot; parts of town.  Yeah, there are more losers at 
<br>
the school, but losers are what makes the bad part of town &quot;bad&quot;.  If you 
<br>
choose not to run with that crowd, you can easily get your education and 
<br>
get out.
<br>
<p>Again, that is how these polarizations occur.  Intelligent/decent/whatever 
<br>
people often don't like to live around people who are less so, and over 
<br>
time, they move out of areas that have a high concentration of 
<br>
riff-raff.  That is one of the benefits of freedom; the ability to live 
<br>
where you want and associate with who you want.  Individuals who are 
<br>
less-than-upstanding citizens generally don't want to live in places where 
<br>
their behavior is aggressively combatted by society, so they tend to 
<br>
associate with and live around others who have similar dispositions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; From a purely economic standpoint, I suspect that the US incurs a huge cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in *not* devoting more resources to education, particularly in the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economically depressed and crime-ridden areas.
</em><br>
<p><p>There is no substantial correlation between money spent and educational 
<br>
results.  Many of the most crime-ridden areas also spend some of the 
<br>
largest amounts of money per student.  The amount of resources spent on 
<br>
education have nothing to do with the problem unless you are a lobbyist for 
<br>
the teacher's union.  Massive increases in funding for education and other 
<br>
programs in the crime-ridden areas have not yielded any substantial 
<br>
results, despite the promises that it would.
<br>
<p>I went to high school in the Poway Unified School District in Southern 
<br>
California, a school district that has a reputation for producing excellent 
<br>
students and generally producing superior educational results.  That 
<br>
particular school district had a policy where, if you were determined to be 
<br>
seriously anti-social in nature, they kicked you out of the normal schools 
<br>
and paid to have you  sent to another high school that had been set up 
<br>
specifically to work with those kinds of people.  The result was that by 
<br>
removing the few percent of anti-social losers and sending them to a single 
<br>
isolated high school (the standards for such were very reasonable in my 
<br>
opinion -- it mostly applied to the usual set of thugs and disruptive 
<br>
idiots that every high school has), they substantially increased the 
<br>
performance of all the other schools in the school district.  This produced 
<br>
good results even in the relatively bad neighborhoods, but it wasn't 
<br>
accomplished by making everyone not bad, rather it was accomplished by 
<br>
segregating the problem individuals.  And quite frankly, even at the high 
<br>
school specifically set up to deal with those individuals, most could not 
<br>
be converted in to normal social individuals.
<br>
<p>You can't really eliminate the bad people, you can merely segregate 
<br>
them.  And given the choice, most &quot;bad&quot; people will congregate with their 
<br>
own kind and stay out of everyone else's hair for the most part anyway.
