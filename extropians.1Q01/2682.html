<p>Extropians are interested in peering into the future.  I have long been
<br>
interested in marketing, so this may explain why I watch TV ads
<br>
with interest.  I am recording the superbowl with the intent to
<br>
forward thru the boring sports to view the 1E5 $/sec ads.
<br>
<p>For those who notice such things, perhaps you have observed
<br>
in the past 5 yrs or so, TV ads have gotten much more effective:
<br>
faster, funnier, definitely edgier.  They have broken thru any
<br>
number of invisible barriers regarding sensitivity and taste.  Such
<br>
as:  many commercials now trivialize death.  Im not making any
<br>
judgements here, merely observations.  Trivializing death may
<br>
be a bad thing, but it leads to effective commercials, which
<br>
earn money, which is a good thing.
<br>
<p>For instance, consider one of my faves:  Adipose T. Lardbottom
<br>
reaches into his fridge to get a double bacon cheese burger.  Suddenly
<br>
there appears the Grim Reaper.
<br>
<p>Lardbottom:  Awwww, you gotta be ki...
<br>
<p>Reaper:  SILENCE!  Wait a minute, you have all Energy Star
<br>
Appliances.  You must care about the environment and saving
<br>
energy!  Tell ya what, Ill probably get fired for this.  But Im
<br>
gonna let ya slide.
<br>
<p>Next scene, Adipose and Grim are sitting on couch like two
<br>
old buddies watching the game.  Lardbottom starts having a
<br>
coronary.  Reaper, in disgust:  Awwww MAN!
<br>
<p>Harrrrrrr!  Great spot!  Short, funny, you remember what
<br>
they were selling, perfect ad!
<br>
<p>Now, let me look into my crystal ball and guess what TV
<br>
ads will be like in 5 yrs.  This making fun of death thing will
<br>
play out soon.  There only so much you can do with it, but
<br>
consider nudity.  It gets your attention quickly and holds it,
<br>
its cheap in that a low priced model nude is better than a high
<br>
priced one clothed.  Its funny if done right.  Nudity doesnt
<br>
really get old or boring:  no matter how much of it you see,
<br>
you always want more.
<br>
<p>My guess is that even in uptight prudish America, some nudity
<br>
will be seen in TV ads in the near future, especially if in a non-
<br>
sexual context, where the nude person is mortified, etc.  They
<br>
actually came pretty close to this already with the mock-ER
<br>
ads for some stock investing firm where a man is wheeled
<br>
into the emergency room and the surgeon reaches under the
<br>
sheet and pulls out a 20 dollar bill,  sternly declaring:
<br>
&quot;This man has money coming out the wazoo.  Get him to a
<br>
private room.&quot;  Great ad, but I dont know what company
<br>
they were selling: minus 10 points.
<br>
<p>My idea for an ad has a short piece of non-sexual nudity:
<br>
buns running out the door.  Watch this channel.  spike
