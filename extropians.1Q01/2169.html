<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I envy you taking up your first language, if it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;indeed your first. I've worked in about a half dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;languages, and would now argue against Perl.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Consider PostgreSQL instead of MySQL (unless you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; find the lack of transactions in MySQL a hindrance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The programmers coming out of the woodwork talking about their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favorite topic....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Amara, as you well know it's my third favorite
<br>
topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Perl isn't so bad, Russell. It's a reasonable workhorse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists like me. I don't have time to continually learn new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programming languages (I already confuse the syntax of the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I know).
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I'm not saying Perl's _bad_, just that there are tools
<br>
I'd rather use now.
<br>
<p>Of course, I'm not a scientist, I'm a programmer who has to
<br>
use these tools on a daily basis, and sometimes (this is the
<br>
kicker) manage other programmers using these tools.
<br>
<p>Have you ever tried to manage a _large_ codebase written
<br>
in Perl by a team of programmers?  It's enough to make one
<br>
cry.
<br>
<p>I've written a longish essay which I revisit and refine from
<br>
time to time.  If you're interested, Amara, I'll send you the
<br>
URL.  It grew out of a tech talk I gave at a client company
<br>
last summer.  It's a Python advocacy piece, of course.
<br>
<p>A couple of points I can mention here though: Python is _much_
<br>
easier to learn than Perl.  I had the benefit of a direct education
<br>
from Randall Schwartz himself (glad SGI picked up the bill), and
<br>
eventually became a pretty fair Perlista.  It took a long while
<br>
though.
<br>
<p>I do think you'd find yourself productive in Python given
<br>
a few hours of study.  There are very good libraries for
<br>
scientists, such as NumPy (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy">http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy</a>).
<br>
See also: &quot;<a href="http://www.python.org/topics/scicomp/">http://www.python.org/topics/scicomp/</a>&quot;.
<br>
<p>Check out &quot;Scientific Computing with Python&quot; too:
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://adass.org/adass/proceedings/adass99/O3-02/">http://adass.org/adass/proceedings/adass99/O3-02/</a>&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For non-purist, old-fashioned scientist types like me: Perl + DBI + an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;SQL db like Oracle or Sybase is a powerful combination for database
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Web interaction. I think that DBI is enough reason to go with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perl. It's a wonderfully, solid and supported library.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>For some applications, this is fine.  I've done a good deal
<br>
of just that type of Perl/DBI::DBM work against various DBMS
<br>
stores.  Sufficient for most DML operations but a bit spotty
<br>
in support of DDL operations (access to the data dictionary),
<br>
especially for the Sybase driver (what you use to talk to
<br>
Sybase-badged and &quot;Sybase Lite&quot; pre-v7 MS SQL Server DBMSs).
<br>
This can be annoying when you write code which talks to
<br>
the data dictionary to generate SQL DML clauses.
<br>
<p>You can do the same work in Python too:
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://www.python.org/topics/database/">http://www.python.org/topics/database/</a>&quot;
<br>
<p>Oh, yes, a related nice thing about Python: if you don't
<br>
want or need to persist your data in an RDBMS, you can serialize
<br>
your data objects to disk using the shelve mechanism.  That's
<br>
another subject... feel free, anyone, to start a subthread
<br>
on this.  Go a bit beyond though and discuss next-generation
<br>
object databases such as ODI.  ;-)
<br>
<p>As for the &quot;purist&quot; thing, I don't think that's an issue with
<br>
me.  From time to time I prefer to re-assess my toolkit and
<br>
re-educate myself.  I'm keeping an eye on the Ruby language,
<br>
just in case it takes off and becomes widely useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And Perl comes in handy for alot of other data processing as well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but then I am a data monkey.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... _really_ sounds like you should at least do a little
<br>
digging into Python.  It's much easier to create new data
<br>
types and manipulate them.  Object orientation is built into
<br>
the language from the ground up, not bolted on (Perl).
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Russell
