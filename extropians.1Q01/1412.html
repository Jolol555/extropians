<em>&gt; That's a rather interesting viewpoint; it's based on a narrow interpretation

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Unless I'm very much mistaken, most countries _do_ base your citizenship

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are also recognized as a citizen of (X), no matter where your parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen to be when you're born. This simplifies the immigration picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- third-trimester pregnant women don't have to worry if they feel like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking a day trip across the border! -- while adding other complications --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm reminded of a FOAF, born of parents living in Italy, who suddenly got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a call-up notice from the Finnish army, even though he'd never visited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finland and didn't speak the language. So all in all I don't think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either a great improvement or a greatly inferior system.
</em><br>
<p>Citizenship here can be based on who one's parents are, but they are
<br>
only your parents if you've been BORN. Birth is the defining moment,
<br>
whether you base it on where you are born or who you are born to. An
<br>
unborn child, at this point at least, is simply considered a tumor of
<br>
sorts, perpetrated by that virus known as sperm, which can be excised
<br>
based on the hosts subjective judgment of it being either benign or
<br>
malignant.
<br>
<p>Citizenship based on parentage can only be claimed via proof found in
<br>
Birth Certificates, as there is no place that issues Conception
<br>
Certificates, is there? You might make a claim on DNA evidence, but
<br>
you'd have to be born enough to make the claim yourself, wouldn't you?
<br>
When I see a court granting immigration to a foreign woman who is
<br>
pregnant with the child of an American based on the child's right to be
<br>
born in the US, then there will begin to be some case law supporting the
<br>
conception interpretation of rights. Until then, its an ideal that I
<br>
share, but that the world does not recognise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I find your construction of the rights of human beings as contingent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on citizenship recognized by a national government curiously, um, curious --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not a very libertarian position, is it?
</em><br>
<p>No its not, but our legal system is no longer oriented toward a
<br>
libertarian society, is it? My personal opinions of rights are based on
<br>
a libertarian construction. My interpretation of the current general
<br>
public interpretation of rights as they are currently recognised in our
<br>
'unfree world' is as I stated. Notice the delineation between the two.
