Rights are recognised to have existed BEFORE this nation (USA)was formed, 
<br>
they do not emminate from the state, case law and maxim recognises the non 
<br>
citizens rights as endowed by &quot;the creator(whatever that is)&quot; and inherent 
<br>
in mankind.
<br>
<p>Does a tourist have a right to property, or can anyone steal her purse?
<br>
<p>I am pro-choice BTW, or at least non govmt interference, but based on other 
<br>
reasons than stated below.

 &gt; I'm reminded of a FOAF, born of parents living in Italy, who suddenly got
 &gt; a call-up notice from the Finnish army, even though he'd never visited
 &gt; Finland and didn't speak the language. So all in all I don't think it's
 &gt; either a great improvement or a greatly inferior system.
<p>Citizenship here can be based on who one's parents are, but they are
only your parents if you've been BORN. Birth is the defining moment,
whether you base it on where you are born or who you are born to. An
unborn child, at this point at least, is simply considered a tumor of
sorts, perpetrated by that virus known as sperm, which can be excised
based on the hosts subjective judgment of it being either benign or
malignant.
<p>Citizenship based on parentage can only be claimed via proof found in
Birth Certificates, as there is no place that issues Conception
Certificates, is there? You might make a claim on DNA evidence, but
you'd have to be born enough to make the claim yourself, wouldn't you?
When I see a court granting immigration to a foreign woman who is
pregnant with the child of an American based on the child's right to be
born in the US, then there will begin to be some case law supporting the
conception interpretation of rights. Until then, its an ideal that I
share, but that the world does not recognise.
<p> &gt;
 &gt; But I find your construction of the rights of human beings as contingent
 &gt; on citizenship recognized by a national government curiously, um, curious 
--
 &gt; it's not a very libertarian position, is it?
<p>No its not, but our legal system is no longer oriented toward a
libertarian society, is it? My personal opinions of rights are based on
a libertarian construction. My interpretation of the current general
public interpretation of rights as they are currently recognised in our
'unfree world' is as I stated. Notice the delineation between the two.
