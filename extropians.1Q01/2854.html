<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The only problem here is that it sounds like parole is automatic,

<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, it is pretty much automatic the way it is enacted now. We
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Culture shock, again: in the UK, eligibility for early release
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't automatic -- bad behaviour leads to forfeiture. If you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telling me that in the USA, if you go to prison and are eligible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for parole you *automatically* get let out early, I just have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say I find that bizarre ...
</em><br>
<p>This depends. The thugs who executed the pediatrician (and his wife and
<br>
son) who delivered me and my siblings came up for parole, but my parents
<br>
led a successful media campaign to deny them parole despite good
<br>
behavior. We have no victim notification laws in most jurisdictions here
<br>
in the US, so victims and their families frequently have no idea when
<br>
the criminals that victimized them are scheduled to get out of prison or
<br>
go up before parole boards. The liberal states even say that notifying
<br>
victims violates the prisoners privacy rights. The only reason my
<br>
parents found out was because of political connections. Sometimes you'll
<br>
get a cop who cares and will go behind the law to tell families what is
<br>
happening.
<br>
The only laws that run counter to this tend to be sex offenders, who
<br>
generally get run out of town in the more heinous cases.
