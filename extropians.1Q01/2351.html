</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is pointless to have a discussion attempting to derive natural rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on this basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not attempting to derive natural rights -- I'm demonstrating that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no such thing as natural rights derived from human nature, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's much more useful to view rights as constructions emerging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from social interaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Your argument is also not sufficient for that purpose.  You would need
<br>
to examine more serious the pro argument and refute it. &quot;Useful&quot; to
<br>
whom? If you use that notion then there you can't just social groups so
<br>
easily, at least not on the basis of being compatible with human
<br>
rights.  What will you judge them by then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm also deliberately not making any assumptions about &quot;human nature&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which underpins natural rights theory) because this is the EXTROPIANS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LIST, where concepts such as alien intelligences, AI's, uplifted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chimpanzees, Matrioshka brains, and so on are topics of discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But you have to start where you are and it is ludricous to dismiss
<br>
natural rights without speaking of the nature they supposedly grow out
<br>
of.  And you have not posited any other nature (which would give rise to
<br>
rights appropriate to that nature).  So this objection is pointless in
<br>
the context of the discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Extropianism is about transhumanism.  This implies a willingness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemplate fundamental changes in human nature. If your theory of rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is derived from human nature, then you are ill-equipped to do business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with sapients that are non-human -- unless you can coerce them into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretending to be human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Contemplate it and nail it down.  Don't just throw out human
<br>
nature wholesale and therefore natural rights because you have the goal
<br>
to question the latter without talking about nature at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moreover, the natural rights theory of the 18th century is infused with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiosity: the US constitution reeks of deism, and the country that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it belongs to has a higher per-capita proportion of fundamentalists than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just about anywhere on the planet except Afghanistan and Iran. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swim in that sea, it's hard to tell what colour the water is -- but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an outsider, the tint is strikingly obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The religiousity of the period is irrelevant.  It was also the time of
<br>
serious questioning of religion and basing of human rights and society
<br>
on naturalistic thought and reason.  Don't try to pretend it was all one
<br>
way.  That is dishonest.  The number of fundamentalist in the country is
<br>
irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *** I repeat: I am not discussing natural rights. I think natural rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are incorrect and that a *better* paradigm for analysing rights exists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as the Einsteinian view of gravitation displaced the Newtonian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one. This isn't something I dreamed up overnight, either; it's been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; floating around for quite a few decades and is quite common outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own parochial national boundaries. ***
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, you haven't given a better paradigm yet nor has anyone else which
<br>
is part of why the world is awash in a sea of cultural relativism.
