<em>&gt;Apple is now 50% owned by M$
</em><br>
<p>This is an urban legend.  In 1977, Bill Gates bought $150 million of 
<br>
stock and paid an estimated $200 million in cash to Apple to finally 
<br>
end infringement claims once and for all.  The stock was only 7% of 
<br>
the company.  It was specially limited to be non-voting stock, 
<br>
non-sellable for three years, and Apple has buy-back rights in 5 
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>Before the deal was made public, there was wild speculation that 
<br>
Microsoft was buying Apple.  After the deal was made public, many 
<br>
people misinterpreted the cash and stock purchase as confirming the 
<br>
rumors.  Even when corrections to these stories were reported in the 
<br>
media, many conspiracy theorists claimed that Microsoft did indeed 
<br>
buy Apple, but was keeping the purchase secret.  The rumors were made 
<br>
worse by April Fools jokes and false news items that reported this 
<br>
story as fact.  This is one of those Internet rumors that just won't 
<br>
die.  Many people still believe that Microsoft bought Apple.
<br>
<p>Here are articles that debunk the claim that Microsoft bought part of Apple:
