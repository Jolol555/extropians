</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you look carefully at my original response to Brian, you'll see that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't criticize him for identifying with a particular side. I simply asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him to define his terms, and asked him why he was so interested in taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides. As I have said over and over again in this forum, I see knee-jerk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side-taking as more of a problem than taking a particular side. This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtle distinction, I will admit, but an important one. As long as we continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to automatically take one side or another, to see side-taking as an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to do, we'll never get anywhere. This is the main problem with partisan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics. Everyone's so busy taking sides, defining positions, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defending them to the death, that no actual problem solving or forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Just because you give lip service to the idea of partisan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; independence doesn't mean that you live by it.  You might try not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being so offended when someone makes a jab at the left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never once expressed offense because someone has taken a jab at the left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My problem is with the act of replacing critical thinking with simplistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jabbing. Again, this isn't side taking. It is critiquing what I see as useless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methodologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, if you had read Brian's post carefully, you would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; noticed that he didn't claim to be on one side or the other.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simply said that &quot;the other side&quot; was getting a taste of their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; medicine.  He could easily have been referring to the other side of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Heston's affiliation, but your own simplistic thinking didn't give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Brian the benefit of the doubt, you just pounced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never claimed he was taking sides. As I said above, I was merely asking him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to define his terms, and was questioning his need to see things in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppositional, side-taking terms. There is a difference between simplistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking (side-taking) and subtle thinking (questioning the need to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides). Oh, and asking someone to clarify what he has said in a public forum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not pouncing. It's a legitimate response.
</em><br>
<p>Refusing to come to a conclusion about which side is right and which is
<br>
wrong is not subtlety, it's pussilanimity. Evil prospers by good men
<br>
doing nothing. Stop doing nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you reject tired old thinking, then how can you see what happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in Florida as anything but a power struggle between two political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parties using every legal means they each had at their disposal.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; struggle was initiated by the Democrats because they were behind in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the count, then it was finished by the Republicans, because they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the highest trump card to play.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never once disagreed with this position. I have equal disdain for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinations of the Democrats.
</em><br>
<p>Not once have I heard you take a democrat to task with the same
<br>
vehemence. You ALWAYS try to dismiss and disqualify someone elses
<br>
partisan commentary by smearing a conservative. You've never taken the
<br>
same tactics toward liberal posters, and you consistently agree with
<br>
liberal posters. Your 'neutrality' is rather transparent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To say that &quot;we have no president&quot; is an indicator that you bought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into every single scrap of Democratic thought that came out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whole affair.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not true. It simply indicates that I thought Bush was handed the presidency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfairly. If Gore had won by the same or similar tactics, I would have made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same comment. My problem is and will continue to be the fact that we, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American people, have been screwed, they did it blatantly, and very few people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to care about it. I am not a supporter of Gore or the Democratic party,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thought he handled himself poorly. If you see this as me being partisan, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess there's nothing I can do about it. You obviously have a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of the term.
</em><br>
<p>a) 2 million absentee ballots across the country were never counted
<br>
b) Bush lost the popular vote by a couple hundred thousand
<br>
c) in cases where absentee ballots were counted, Bush won them by more
<br>
than 60%
<br>
d) if the 2 million uncounted absentee ballots were in fact counted,
<br>
Bush would likely have won the popular vote
<br>
e) the inventor of the votamatic machines has testified that the most
<br>
frequent cause of 'pregnant chads' is when a voter tries to punch
<br>
multiple ballots at the same time: i.e. ballot stuffing.
<br>
f) there were far more 'pregnant chads' for Gore than Bush, ergo the DNC
<br>
was corrupting the Florida election and STILL lost.
<br>
g) DNC lobbying firms knew about this pregnant chad phenomenon, which is
<br>
why they instigated the 'my ballot wasn't counted' &quot;grassroots&quot; protest
<br>
in an attempt to get more votes for Gore BEFORE the Florida polls even
<br>
closed (they are on record as having called over 5,000 people in order
<br>
to instigate the 'grassroots' campaign).
<br>
h) Gore still lost the Florida election despite heavy DNC corruption of
<br>
the punch card system by Gore campaign manager Bill Daley, whose Chicago
<br>
family has decades of experience in cheating on elections.
<br>
i) under the Constitution, the electoral system decides the President,
<br>
not the popular vote.
<br>
<p>You cannot consistently say both that both sides were equally corrupt
<br>
AND that Bush 'stole' the election. If the DNC committed less fraud than
<br>
the GOP in Florida, then Bush won despite an attempt to steal the
<br>
election by the DNC. If you claim that the GOP committed more fraud,
<br>
please document this.
