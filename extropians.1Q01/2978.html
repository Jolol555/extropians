<p>The funding question leads me into a paradox.  The job is best
<br>
done with venture capital, which will come in only if there is a
<br>
way to get the money back.  The first thing the Martians would
<br>
produce of value would be their firsthand account of the adventure.
<br>
But how to make money on it?  The investors must somehow
<br>
be able to sell the story, and to do so they would need to
<br>
control the information.  They could not, for instance, sell it
<br>
in book or magazine form: the information is too expensive
<br>
to collect and too easy to copy.
<br>
<p>I can envision doling out the story in something analogous to a
<br>
movie theatre.  Suppose someone[s] is launched to Mars tomorrow.
<br>
How much would you pay to find out how things are going?
<br>
Would you pay 30 bucks for a two hour session?  50?  How
<br>
about the day they land.  Now how much?  I would pony up
<br>
a couple hundred on that day.
<br>
<p>I would suggest that Martian email would be worth a fortune,
<br>
however the paradox is this: just as in information sales now,
<br>
the information would need to be degraded in order to be sold.
<br>
We cant currently buy our books on computer readable formats,
<br>
we must buy &quot;pictures of the information&quot;  [Eliezer's apt discription].
<br>
<p>Likewise, we would ideally like to have the Martian emails emailed
<br>
to us, eh?  But they wont be, for those could be sent out to those
<br>
who didnt pay, or resold illegally.  So we would need to go into
<br>
a movie-theater analog, and pay thru the wazoo with no recording
<br>
devices.  With this arrangement is our only hope of raising
<br>
sufficient venture capital to get launched even the brutally Spartan
<br>
minimalist Mars colony I envision.  spike
