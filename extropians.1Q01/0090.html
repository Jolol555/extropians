<em>&gt; &gt; Same here. However, I like to think of the principles being applied at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  level of, say, a shopping mall (which would then become much more than

<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  shopping mall) or an industrial complex. These projects are tightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  from the beginning anyhow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've had the same thought for years.  Two of my earliest architectural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;aha&quot; experiences happened here in Houston, both on the same trip in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1973 or '74. My girlfriend (a Houstonian, who I was visiting), took me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;into the Hyatt Regency and made me not look up until I was standing in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the middle (if you could see the way she looked, you'd understand why &gt;I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was willing to do just about anything she asked me to do).  Then she &gt;told 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me to look up and I had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true mind-blowing experience as I took in the cavernous vertical space &gt;of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the 25(?)-story interior atrium around which the hotel is built.  I &gt;was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speechless for a good long time.
</em><br>
<p>This would be a great way to be introduced to a wonderful (especially back 
<br>
in the 70s) building.  Growing up in Houston the Hyatt Regency was one of my 
<br>
favorite buildings around.  I used to enjoy outtings with my Mother, when 
<br>
we'd venture downtown and take in the cavernous space of the Hyatt lobby, 
<br>
and then maybe get some lunch at the revolving restaurant on top.
<br>
<p>My understanding is that the Houston Hyatt was the first hotel in the world 
<br>
to employ this type of take-your-breath-away, huge, cavernous lobby effect.  
<br>
A lot of hotels worldwide use this design concept now, and I'm glad: it's 
<br>
too much fun to be in just one city.
<br>
<p>As for the revolving part, that's spread worldwide, too, though I'm less 
<br>
glad about that.  It seems to be becoming an architectural novelty in the 
<br>
developing world.
<br>
<p>'Though it's not real relevant to this thread, I'm reminded of a revolving 
<br>
restaurant atop a hotel in downtown Chongqing, China, which I went to on my 
<br>
own a couple years back.  Thankfully they had an English-language menu, but 
<br>
for some dishes a bit seemed to get lost in the translation.  One dish which 
<br>
I didn't try was &quot;Braised Bigs Colon&quot;.  Yes, that is a &quot;B&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The second was my first experience of a shopping mall, when we went   &gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Galleria the same day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Both experiences reverberated in my mind for quite some time.  I &gt;imagined 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merging the two spaces and combining living and working and &gt;retail spaces 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by gradually extending the Galleria-style multi-story &gt;mall to connect to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spaces like the Hyatt that would be apartment &gt;buildings and also office 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buildings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I foresaw a natural, organic growth possibility for a kind of urban 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;landscape that promised the efficiencies and vitality of Soleri's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;arcologies, but without the need for so much up-front planning and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;investment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For years I was surprised that centers like the Galleria didn't &gt;naturally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develop along the pathway I had imagined. The benefits to &gt;all participants 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seemed like an obvious incentive to engage in that &gt;direction of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I still wonder why it hasn't happened.  Partly, it's because many -- &gt;if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not most -- people really do seem to want their own piece of dirt, &gt;no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter how small, and the level of privacy and the feeling of &gt;autonomy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that detached houses provide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another reason is the basic inertia inherent in the construction and &gt;real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;estate development industries.  Because work in those industries &gt;is so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;risky and capital intensive, development tends to stick to &gt;what's known 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and proven to work.
</em><br>
<p>To see what some people prefer to the type of development described (which 
<br>
I've always thought would be pretty cool, too), look no further than a block 
<br>
West of the Houston Galleria.  There, run-down single-story houses are being 
<br>
bulldozered and replaced by strange pseudo-houses: free-standing brick homes 
<br>
built so close together that in my view they might as well be townhomes, but 
<br>
it's like you said, the owners have gotten their piece of dirt and are in a 
<br>
detached house, even if it is just one foot from the next-door neighbors' 
<br>
identical, characterless abode.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>Bill Douglass
