<p>
Having known nothing about this case - Jonathan Lebed, accused of US stock
<br>
market manipulation by the SEC - I came across this article on NYT. It is a
<br>
stunning piece of writing, I couldn't recommend reading it too highly!
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/25/magazine/25STOCK-TRADER.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/25/magazine/25STOCK-TRADER.html</a>
<br>
<p>Apart from the interesting plot (the amazing success of this boy), and the
<br>
critical analysis of what the stock market is, vs what the SEC thinks it is,
<br>
there is a far more important theme explored in the article.
<br>
<p>The most interesting thing to my mind is the fact that this young boy dealt
<br>
extraordinarily successfully in an adult's world. A key to this was his use
<br>
of the internet, because the internet hides identity. This fact of the
<br>
internet (now), used as it is to scare the ignorant, usually with talk of
<br>
pedophiles and other dangers to the kiddies, is actually an incredibly
<br>
liberating and empowering force for children.
<br>
<p>I feel, and have expressed here before, that children are treated like
<br>
mindless barbarians in general, and can do/achieve very little of substance
<br>
usually, due to the predjudice against them in the bricks&amp;mortar world, and
<br>
their subsequent lack of buy in (cf teen angst).
<br>
<p>However, I've found that in the world of the net, where I now spend a lot of
<br>
my waking hours, children have a new found power; the power to mask the fact
<br>
that they are children. In this environment, consequent to this ability, I
<br>
have met quite a few kids whose age I would never guess, who were more
<br>
mature and more intelligent than many, maybe most adults that I
<br>
meet.Conversely, I meet many adults online, who I am sure must be kids
<br>
because they behave in such a juvenile fashion, only to discover that they
<br>
really are my age.
<br>
<p>It's been quite a revelation for me, because in the end I'm just as
<br>
prejudiced as everyone else. If I meet a kid in the flesh, I more often than
<br>
not treat him/her like a kid; that is, a lesser being, a second class
<br>
citizen. However, if I meet a kid online, where I can't see the acne spots,
<br>
the child's physique, I start with the assumption that I am speaking to an
<br>
equal.
<br>
<p>The article strongly underscores this point; it paints the contrasting
<br>
pictures of the sullen teen in the family environment, unremarkable,
<br>
unimpressive, versus the confident, intelligent, highly competent online
<br>
being, who has created himself a small fortune with utterly minimal
<br>
assistance, and in spite of the negative messages from authority (once his
<br>
&quot;ruse&quot; had been discovered).
<br>
<p>Something has to happen about this treatment of kids. It can't be helpful to
<br>
our world at large, and it's devastating to the individuals. I'm sure this
<br>
will resonate with many list members, who only have to remember their own
<br>
childhoods.
<br>
<p>Anyway, read the article!
<br>

<br>
<p>btw, Here's my new sig; its a bit overblown, my apologies. The site is in
<br>
it's v1.0 form, still with much work to do, but it's getting there. I'd
<br>
appreciate feedback from those who feel so moved. Thanks.
