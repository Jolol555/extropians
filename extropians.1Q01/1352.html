<p>This is surely a wonderful and moving story. In THE CLOCK, Brand cites
<br>
something similar: a mature oak forest in Sweden, planted in 1869 at the
<br>
order of Parliament to deal with the needs of the navy in the 1990s.
<br>
<p>But this story has two contrasted implications: planning for the
<br>
comparatively deep future on the basis of continuity can create and sustain
<br>
that very continuity, even when the express purpose of the plans is
<br>
superseded; but the goal of the plans is indeed very likely to be
<br>
superseded if exponentiating technology is part of the prospect. Oxford
<br>
Colleges and ancient cathedrals and great forests are among the few human
<br>
artifacts in some measure immune from what one might dub teleological
<br>
corrosion. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not so sure Brand wouldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand the idea of qualitative change. 
</em><br>
<p>Now that I've finished reading the book, I'm very much more sympathetic to
<br>
his position, although I regard it as probably misguided, if anything as
<br>
discontinuous as a Spike really *is* in the offing. He does not deny that
<br>
drastic charge is likely; he just avoids looking it squarely in the eye.
<br>
For example, I waited for many pages for any hint that he knew human
<br>
longevity was almost certainly going to increase (assuming humans persist);
<br>
the heading isn't in the index. Finally, yes, theres a chapter that toys
<br>
diffidently with the subject. He sees one implication: `If long life leads
<br>
to greater responsibility, because you hang around long enough to suffer
<br>
the consequences of your short-sighted actions, then immortality logically
<br>
leads to infinite responsibility' (p. 151). Just so - and such
<br>
considerations, once grasped, ought strictly to have made him go back to
<br>
the start of the book and rewrite it completely. But of course he couldn't
<br>
do that, and if he had nobody would have taken it seriously. Not for a
<br>
couple of generations, anyway.
<br>
<p>But Brand has some wonderfully deep meditations on the nature of time
<br>
scale, and I'd urge everyone here to read at least chapter seven, `The
<br>
Order of Civilization', where he sketches the interplay between six
<br>
temporal scales: fashion-art/ commerce / infrastructure / governance /
<br>
culture / nature. His consideration of these different time scales and how
<br>
they interpenetrate (and go wrong when one or another hypertrophies at the
<br>
expense of the rest) is profound and important. Certainly it confirms my
<br>
own doubts about the alleged ubiquitous benefits of the market's Invisible
<br>
Hand. (See, for example, his brief description of the Californian timber
<br>
clear-felled for immediate profit by Maxxam despite long-term ruin.)
<br>
<p>He makes an important point of salience to some on this list:
<br>
<p>`The very old will have experienced enough past to believe in the reality
<br>
of consequences, while the young will not have been wrong about enough
<br>
future yet to doubt their own puerile notions. It's an old dialogue, but
<br>
with a new balance of power when the old out-number the young' (p. 152).
<br>
<p>I just wish he'd taken more notice of how everything, including the
<br>
validity of his august project, changes with the arrival of indefinite
<br>
longevity, human genomic engineering, and especially self-rewriting AIs.
