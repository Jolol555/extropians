<br>
picking on &quot;target&quot; groups start driving a pickup truck.  I have driven a
<br>
pick up at times in my life but an auto much more often yet a good 80% of my
<br>
stops have been while in the pick up.  Furthermore the nature of the stops
<br>
are such that I have never received a payable ticket during one of those
<br>
pickup stops.  Either no ticket was issued or it was nonsense and easily
<br>
beaten.

<p>It's well known that the FBI has issued &quot;guidelines&quot; for police that state 
<br>
that pick-up trucks are an indicator of extremist group membership. Any 
<br>
religious, gun, or Constitutional stickers are to be treated as an 
<br>
indication that the driver is possibly armed and dangerous. God help you if 
<br>
you are also wearing camo at the time...
