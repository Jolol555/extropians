<em>&gt;&gt; One of the saddest things I ever saw was an ethnography film
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about a little girl that had been raised in a cage in a cold dark
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; basement by uncaring parents. Then she had the misfortune to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; raised in the household of a psychologist called in when she was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discovered (for &quot;study&quot;).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This sounds very much (but not precisely) like the notorious case
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of &quot;Genie&quot;, as first documented by author and journalist Russ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rymer in two successive issues of _The New Yorker_ in 1992.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; My fists clench and unclench at the thought, and I feel rage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;wash through me when I think about it. The parents would face
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;worse at my hands, and that psychologist would be in for major
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;attitude adjusting as well.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Your rage might have been deliberately fanned by the film
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you saw.  There were several sides to this story, as I recall,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and recriminations flew thick and fast among the parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involved.  The parents (the father, in particular) had a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more wrong with them than &quot;uncaring&quot; implies (not that that takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away from the enormity of the wrong they committed against their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;daughter).  It's true that, whatever happened, the story of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Genie&quot; is not as pretty or romantic as that of the woman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depicted by Jodie Foster in the movie _Nell_.
</em><br>
<p>I would have to assume that a great deal was wrong with the people
<br>
who did this to the little girl.
<br>
<p>I was even more concerned with the lack of care I saw her receive
<br>
at the hands of the so called experts.
<br>
<p>It probably was intentional, and it had the desired effect. If by
<br>
some strange circumstance some poor person like that fell into my
<br>
care even temporarily, bachelor or not, you couldn't have pried her
<br>
away from me with the help of the 1st Marine Division. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;See, for example
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/hsbioethics/unit3_4.htm">http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/hsbioethics/unit3_4.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(there are references at the end), or Google search
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the keywords Rymer and Genie.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the info.
