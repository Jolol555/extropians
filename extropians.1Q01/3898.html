<p>It appears as if Brian D Williams &lt;<a href="mailto:talon57@well.com?Subject=Re:%20SOC:%20Re:%20The%20Myth%20of%20Monogamy&In-Reply-To=&lt;200102141600.RAA26559@color.sics.se&gt;">talon57@well.com</a>&gt; then wondered:
<br>
|
<br>
|Excuse me, What prejudice? Read again, I made no specific
<br>
|reference.
<br>
<p>Excuse taken. :-)
<br>
<p>If one find biological facts to not match one's meme system, and one decides
<br>
to ignore the biological facts due to this, then I call that a &quot;prejudice&quot;.
<br>
<p>Maybe I have misunderstood your statement (quote [1] above) to mean this,
<br>
but if so, feel free to elaborate on the statement as to what you _really_
<br>
meant.
<br>
<p>It really appears as if you meant that referring to biological theories
<br>
as to human male behaviour, esp. Mr. Jackson's extramatrimonical activities,
<br>
was a (quote) &quot;lame excuse&quot; (end quote).
<br>
<p>Or did you react on the word &quot;prejudice&quot; as too harsh a word to classify
<br>
such an opinion?
<br>
<p>|&gt;I lack to detect how your local customs of matrimony (a custom
<br>
|&gt;built by the local religious death cult's priesthood against
<br>
|&gt;having fun with your body), have any bearing on either character
<br>
|&gt;or integrity, 
<br>
|
<br>
|It's not my custom, it's societies. And yes, when anyone takes a
<br>
|vow I expect them to fulfill it, inability to do so demonstrates a
<br>
|lack of character, and integrity.
<br>
<p>Feel free to replace /your local/ with /the local/, if you feel offended
<br>
by the word &quot;your&quot;.
<br>
<p>Due to oppression of personal freedom from humans in government, religion,
<br>
and in other groups, the only way for humans to live together requires that
<br>
they do these meaningless rituals as required by the Government or the Right
<br>
Religion. Those who mistake empty rituals for a lack of character or integrity
<br>
make a great mistake, indeed. Most humans do not wish to fight oppression
<br>
as ardently as Number 6 in the Prisoner TV series does.
<br>
<p>Societies consist of individuals, and individuals have customs, a &quot;society&quot;
<br>
being an abstraction in the head of humans. Abstraction cannot feel, cannot
<br>
have customs, etc. Individuals do. Minor point, though.
<br>
<p>|&gt;even when applied to a person who you do not like for political
<br>
|&gt;reasons.
<br>
|
<br>
|Assumption on your part, and actually I'm a former admirer of
<br>
|Jackson, and once voted for him in the primary. So a wrong
<br>
|assumption at that.
<br>
<p>You commented on the Jackson individual, so naturally I assumed you really
<br>
meant to discuss him, as a specific example of a general rule. If you did
<br>
not mean that, then I will naturally repent.
<br>
<p>I claim only how it appeared to me. If I am in error, feel free to correct me.
