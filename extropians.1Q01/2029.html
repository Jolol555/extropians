</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Errrr....I take it that you don't really know how to use SQL*Plus?  Things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like conditionals, loops, etc are all supported natively inside SQL*Plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without doing any of the stuff you are talking about.  In fact, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SQL*Plus shell is actually quite powerful.  However, most people I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who work on Oracle haven't figured out how to do all but the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitive things with SQL*Plus (usually limited to running queries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compiling stored procedures, and spooling data).  Heck it took me quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of years of working with SQL*Plus to really start exploiting its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities.  There really isn't a whole lot you can do programmatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can't reasonably be done from SQL*Plus if you know what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing, and the design is reasonable and consistent with CLI type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments.  It is a very deep tool.
</em><br>
<p>Damn, caught out; I really don't know it well at all, apparently. Do you
<br>
have some good links to resources on this? The ones I found were less than
<br>
good. Loops? Conditionals? Do I have to beg?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The caveat being that it works better under Unix than Windows.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Windows version looks like a straight port where they didn't bother to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fork the code to accommodate differences in behavior between Windows and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unix.  The Unix version is great because it integrates very well with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal unix command line (and all the normal unix utilities that go with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it), which makes sense because that is a large part of its heritage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sun's systems have been the reference platform for development for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years at Oracle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I bet there are great tools, of course, to substitute for this crud,
</em><br>
offered
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by third parties. Must find myself one, preferably with a gui.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or you could learn to use the capabilities of the software you already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have. :^)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's not easy from Oracle, either; you need in depth arcane knowledge of
</em><br>
all
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these 70's style crypto command line tools, which keeps skilled dbas on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gravy train. Sorry, that's not fair, but I am a developer... I'm
</em><br>
expected to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; undervalue a DBA's role, it's a professional obligation :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DBAs exist to keep developers from getting bored.  I could probably serve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an Oracle DBA, but I wouldn't want to -- it is a very uninteresting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job.  In truth, the Oracle DBA command line is actually very consistent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the point that I can correctly guess the syntax and parameter formats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for commands that I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;DBAs exist to keep developers from getting bored.&quot; - can I have this as a
<br>
quote?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now you're talking! I find that delphi is so good, that it's quicker for
</em><br>
me
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to throw together a nice gui app to do something against Oracle, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instance, than it is to try to write cryptic SQL*Plus scripts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whatever works for you, though a good working knowledge of PL/SQL is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraordinarily useful if you want to push the runtime performance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envelope.  My work revolves a lot around application scalability.
</em><br>
<p>Probably I will need to do that some time. Currently, I need to get
<br>
acceptably performing code out on time, and that's not going to change for a
<br>
while.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've had to do some pretty tight multithreading work myself lately,
</em><br>
writing
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; free threaded COM objects. Fire up Delphi, yet again, and use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; TMultiReadExclusiveWrite object; it's stupidly simple to take care of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most common cases, without doing something dumb like using a mutex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what do you do when you are faced with an uncommon case?  Sometimes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple reader-writer lock is a pretty inefficient way to go.  In truth, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often prefer to work with locking primitives because it allows me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strictly control the behaviors of locks.  I don't re-invent locks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everytime a need a complicated one; I have well-worn libraries that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all manners of unusual locks in them built on POSIX primitives.  Windows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threads are odd enough behavior-wise that they aren't really portable when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance is a consideration.  One size fits all locking solutions (like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java monitors &lt;shudder&gt;), can give poor performance for some applications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where desired thread behavior is more complicated (common when dealing
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; scalability issues).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do I remember that you do really scary code generation stuff? The memory is
<br>
vague.
<br>
<p>When I need to do uncommon case stuff, well, I tear my hair out (mental
<br>
note: stop this before entirely bald), then spend time on it, using the
<br>
primitives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But these are my issues; most developers do just fine using off-the-shelf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits without worrying about the internals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yep. For the most part I am most developers, and you are right.
