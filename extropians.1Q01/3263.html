<p>It is very doubtful we can solve the first two in any very thorough way

without NT.  The last is insufficient to eliminate all human disease or
<br>
even raise our IQs too far.

<p><em>&gt;As a bioscience sort of guy I tend to look to the &quot;more-certain&quot;

</em><br>
<p>Show me the first person successfully revived without NT and I will
<br>
agree that this is cool even without.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    genetic engineering is definitely NNN tech.
</em><br>
<p>sorry... NNN?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    Next stop ..NNN borganisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Take a single individual, suitable for making a pilot project.  Use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5-years away simple cloning tech to generate a first gen group of say five.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Use third-worlder surrogate mothers to carry the fetal clones.  You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employ any and all en vitro enhancement techniques (the epigentic, &quot;enriched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment&quot; toys). The best money can buy naturally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Once your first gen is born it's best to be VERY careful about how much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you are doing is public knowledge.  Assuming one was in a sufficently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawless locality other &quot;steps&quot; to ensure the collective come to mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   A conlang (similar in principle to loglan/Lojban, though aimed towards a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very different outcome) would be absolutely needed as the first native
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language of the brood.
</em><br>
<p>Uh.  You haven't said at all what you are attempting to do.  So far you
<br>
have some genetically identical copies growing up with the best
<br>
treatments money can buy plus a lot of twisting to try to persuade them
<br>
they are one organism in order to insure ???.  I don't get it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   You could take advantage of the Sapir-Worf hypothesis (essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language shapes cognition), and structure the brood's language in such a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the identity barriers were intrinsically blurred.  Multiple prounouns
</em><br>
<p>What for?  Exactly what do you think that will accomplish?  What are you
<br>
cooking in your laboratory that treats humans as simply experimental
<br>
subjects?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and careful vocabulary selection would be indicated. Inclusion of modalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of expression such as gesture and sign &quot;phonenemes&quot;  would reinforce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;difference&quot; between the Brood and others. why force kids to make up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secret language..give it to them. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   You might encourage the children to think of the other Brood members as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;extensions of themselves&quot; from the earliest months.  The ultimate goal here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;he looks just like me, so he is (essentially) Me&quot;.  The aims would be a
</em><br>
<p>He (or member 5) gets a tummy ache and I don't (this time).  He steps on
<br>
my hand and I hurt.  I don't think you can wipe out obvious
<br>
differences.  These clones will diverge over time. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; psychological gestualt, extreme empathy, and the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pseudotelepathy (something that seems psychic, even though it's just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skill).  The final angle on this is sortof taboo in modern america..but you
</em><br>
<p>Is there any limit to your suppositions? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; can encourage all sorts of mindsets with the proper pharmaceuticals (another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NNN tech!) Nothing like tripping as a bonding experience.  Encouraging the
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes.  Tripping is such a major bonding experience that most hippie
<br>
communes immediately fell into a pattern of utter unity and cooperation 
<br>
and most of us ex-trippers are utterly bound to one another and
<br>
humanity.  Yeah, right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; use of journals and the like to &quot;assist in the aquisition of memories housed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in adjacent neural structures&quot; would be good too.  Electronic-journals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the Net as a neural crutch are tools for elevating a subculture to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true &quot;community of like minds&quot;.  How likely is it that 5+ genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical individuals with IQs in the 140+ range who really think they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces of the same macro-organism, won't &quot;become&quot; what they think they are.
</em><br>
<p>And what is that?  A collective of minds?  So what?  The spark of
<br>
original thought is unlikely in that it originates in one head at a time
<br>
and if all 5 don't immediately catch it then it is a problem to the
<br>
artificial identity you have artifically attempted to enforce.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    As tech advances you can deploy all new technologies into the &quot;witch's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brew&quot;.  wearables, interface tech.  it's all SO much more effective if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are already on the &quot;same wavelength&quot; with your clan gen.   Naturally, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start with a decent set of genes, you can raise genius.  Then they work out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the details with the next generation. And so forth.  You attain complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of a single individual genome and you have the knowledge you need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the whole family..no wasteful genetic shuffling every generation, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;regression towards the norm&quot; smoothing out the precious sigmas of deviation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the general population's intelligence level.
</em><br>
<p>How is the group becoming genetically enhanced?  You are cloning the
<br>
same pattern over and over again.  Do you really think this will get us
<br>
any closer to solving the problems we all care about?  How many
<br>
generations of illegal playing around of this kind are needed to produce
<br>
any results that are really useful (in your view) at all?  Does the
<br>
world tread water in the meantime?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   The weird thing about all this is it sounds doable...without waiting for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nano to allow you to upload or download your mind and into a waiting clone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body.  I'd much rather meet the Singularity with a half-hundred younger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selves (likely MUCH more intelligent capable selves) at my back. An if the
</em><br>
<p>Here is a large mistake.  Those clones ARE NOT YOU and are not your
<br>
&quot;younger selves&quot;.  They are their own person[s].  It is precisely the
<br>
same as hoping your children or theirs will make it or be with you.  You
<br>
will not meet the Singularity through these clones because you are not
<br>
in them.  The Singularity itself will not come without AI and/or NT
<br>
taking off. 
<br>
<p>Also, there is no reason whatsoever to suppose an exponential RAMP in
<br>
abilities simply by the techniques you mention.  No ramp, no
<br>
singularity. Thanks for playing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; singularity doesn't get here anytime soon...well I'd rather have myselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guarding my cryovault, than someone else.  At least my clones would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentimental attachment to my ancient ass. You care to take odds on who would
</em><br>
<p>You have no idea that these clones would make better guards of your
<br>
cryovault. You have purposefully attempting to mold them to have no
<br>
concept of individuality and thus it is unlikely they would have
<br>
overmuch respect for your individuality.  Do you really think this makes
<br>
you safer?  It takes some individuality to form sentimental attachment
<br>
to another individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; be more likely to devitrify one of us in 200 years... society at large and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8th generation conventional descendants for you ...or a clan of selves who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;know&quot; they are a lifeform that wouldn't exist without you and really want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to talk to you about how it all started?  If nothing else...it sounds like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an outstanding cryonics Trust, no?
</em><br>
<p>No.  It sounds like a rather hideous experiment that produces nothing
<br>
that is likely to be of any help.
