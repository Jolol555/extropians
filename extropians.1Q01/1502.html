<em>&gt;&gt; The future? if we ever get permission to do long distance, I predict
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; flat rate pricing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe that the customers will demand it.  Why will the LDCs be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provide unlimited service at a flat rate?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;For the same reason that ISPs are currently able to provide &quot;unlimited&quot;
<br>
internet access. There doesn't appear to be any major obstacle to switching
<br>
most of the phone system to run over the internet (although there are lots
<br>
of minor obstacles and the incentives to start the switch are fairly weak).
<br>
&nbsp;Of course the term &quot;unlimited&quot; as used by ISPs is somewhat deceptive, but
<br>
is close enough to the truth to satisfy more people than it offends.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Why do consumers demand flat rates when charging by usage would produce
<br>
better incentives, presumably resulting in better service? The easily
<br>
measured transaction costs associated with pricing by the minute and
<br>
billing electronically seem too low to explain the behavior of ISPs.
<br>
&nbsp;One possibility is that businesses consistently set prices too high
<br>
when pricing small increments of service. My gut reaction when comparing
<br>
fine-grained prices to flat rate prices seems to suggest this is happening,
<br>
but I can't come up with a plausible explanation of what would insulate
<br>
this phenomenon from competition effectively enough for it to be the main
<br>
explanation.
<br>
&nbsp;It seems that there must be significant transaction costs somewhere.
<br>
&nbsp;Could it be that the costs of resolving billing disputes are much higher
<br>
with fine-grained pricing? I doubt this is the main explanation. I worked
<br>
at Quote.com during a period when it moved from getting a significant
<br>
fraction of its revenue from per-web-page charges to getting most of its
<br>
revenue from monthly subscriptions and ads, and I heard no indication
<br>
that it had much effect on customer service expenses (responses to a
<br>
customer survey indicating customers griped about per-web-page charges
<br>
but not monthly subscription fees seemed to be the main reason for
<br>
migrating to the latter).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The best explanation that I can come up with is psychological transaction
<br>
costs. Back when our ancestors lived in small tribes, commercial exchanges
<br>
consisted mainly of transactions with strangers, while interactions with
<br>
familiar people used a different mode, sometimes called a gift-exchange
<br>
economy, which often has much lower price negotiation costs.
<br>
&nbsp;For dealings with people you may never see again, it makes sense to
<br>
adopt a policy of always disputing an attempt to &quot;cheat&quot;, even if the
<br>
effort involved in the dispute exceeds the disputed value. A reputation
<br>
for always disputing a class of phenomena can effectively deter those
<br>
phenomena. So people look for a &quot;Schelling point&quot;-like threshold for
<br>
distinguishing between interactions that deserve carefull individual
<br>
scrutiny and those for which the scrutiny can be averaged flexibly over
<br>
numerous interactions. 
<br>
&nbsp;Monthly subscription fees look sufficiently different from one-time
<br>
commercial transactions that some people are able to fit them into a
<br>
mental model that doesn't require carefull cheater detection analysis
<br>
(it sounds like buying membership in a group), and even those who don't
<br>
fit them into a different category only feel the need to do the cheater
<br>
detection analysis once a month or less.
<br>
&nbsp;But when paying for each web page or each minute of access, people
<br>
apparently feel obligated to perform mental cheater-detection calculations
<br>
that would be appropriate for occasional large transactions, but require
<br>
too much thought to be appropriate for $0.10 transactions.
