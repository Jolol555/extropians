<em>&gt;It seems to me that people of the Jewish culture are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less antagonistic to cryo-Extro-life-extension ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Arlene Sheskin's book _Cryonics_ included a survey of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cryonicists from about 25 years ago. Some very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;percentage of cryos in her survey were Jewish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Admittedly, many of them apparently came from the New
</em><br>
<em>&gt;York area, but it was a very large
</em><br>
percentage--perhaps &gt;25-50%.
<br>
<p><p>I've read a number of intellectual histories of the
<br>
Jews which bear out this kind of tolerance.  While
<br>
still firmly an atheist, I have developed a
<br>
fascination
<br>
for Jewish intellectual history.
<br>
<p>My latest read, started and finished on the Hong Kong
<br>
-&gt; Vancouver leg of my recent trip back to the 
<br>
US, was the mostly excellent &quot;The Gifts of the
<br>
Jews: How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the
<br>
Way Everyone Thinks and Feels&quot;, by Thomas Cahill,
<br>
1998 (ISBN 0-385-48249-3).  Highly recommended.
<br>
It's the 2nd book in a planned total of seven in his
<br>
&quot;Hinges of History&quot; series, following on to his
<br>
&quot;How the Irish Saved Civilization&quot;, the book I
<br>
read on my way _over_ to Hong Kong, and another
<br>
I highly recommend.
