<p>
Other than paying lip-service to such high-falutin' concepts as individual
<br>
liberty and (aw shucks) just plain ole common sense, I am at a loss to understand
<br>
why a speech by Heston could be important to extropians. As is typical of
<br>
right-wing pundits, he is once more engaging in the type of empty (but, by gosh,
<br>
emotionally stirring) rhetoric and most-extreme-example finger-pointing that is
<br>
so typical of the status quo keepers. Sure, I'm for individual liberty like old
<br>
Chuck. Sure, I think some people on the left sometimes react in extreme and
<br>
ridiculous ways to imagined (or at least exaggerated) slights (as do people of
<br>
all political persuasions). But do I really need to dissect his speech
<br>
point-by-point in order to show where sincere concern ends and (rather lame)
<br>
propagandizing begins? (Because I will.)
<br>
<p>C'mon, Max. I'm all for individual liberty and an end to ridiculousness, but
<br>
Chuck Heston? Rush Limbaugh? They're reactionary gatekeepers in libertarian (I'm
<br>
using the term generically here) clothing, exemplars of the old order who have
<br>
appropriated tricks from their (sometimes imagined) opponents and turned them
<br>
back on them (often badly). Just because Heston's speech is a good speech (and it
<br>
is) doesn't make it important. (I mean, Clinton delivered some damn fine speeches
<br>
and look where that ended up.)
<br>
<p>just my 2 cents,
<br>
Neal Blaikie
