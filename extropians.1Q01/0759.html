<em>&gt;&gt;     That was very good.  That also takes on another meaning when one is

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I am not an anti-gun extremist, but an articulate moderate, but as I wrote in my phenomenology of extremism, an extremist must label everyone who does not agree with them on every particular as either a clueless dupe or a malevolent and duplicitous shill.  I guess this extremist has opted for #2.

<em>&gt;Now now, let's not pick on the media.  They're only doing their job of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confounding and confusing the issues with words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The word automatic, which goes back to the Greek word automatos, means:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;acting of one's own will, self-acting, of itself,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I guess that means that an automatic weapon will shoot of its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accord!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Holy Shit, Maynard!  Start the presses!  Automatic weapons have a mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their own and pull their own triggers!  I always knowed them things was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evil!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And the prefix &quot;semi&quot; means:  &quot;resembling or having some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;characteristics of.&quot;  That would mean that semi-automatics are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;semi-conscious&quot; and only pull their own triggers from time to time and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without much forethought.  I find this very frightening and wonder why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;press hasn't picked up on this.  I'd best go unload all of my guns so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't up and kill someone on their own!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Yeah, as Harlan Ellison observed: &quot;Guns don't kill people; people kill people - mainly, with guns.&quot;  One used to have to be strong, fast, devious or smart to kill.  Now any weak, slow, tactless dummy can do it - to anyone else, deserving or not, in defence or attack - to one's fact, or in the back.  And some folks are much more likely to - kids, violent criminals, and the clinically insane - the irresponsivility triad - which is why they should be excliuded from 2nd amendment protection - for the protection of the rest of us.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
PS: do you know what the real irony is?  I was just conducting a running phenomenology of extremism, and what happens? The extremists feel maligned and felt the need to conduct a pack attack, just as I have experienced here before, and just as I characterized in my analysis.  Thanks for revealing yourselves for what you truly are AND making me a prophet AGAIN.  Do you really think you will deter me from ceaslessly insisting that your rabid pack crawl back into your wet dark exi-freedom hole under your flat luddite retro rock and leave the thoughtful people here to discuss the future?  I've had a large circle of fundamentalist christians, led by evangelist Larry Lea, loudly and passionately pray to my face for Sweet Jesus to take me, by name, then and there, because I shielded women from their picket poster attacks as they arrived to enter the clinic.  Do you really think a pack of insecure progun extremist pencil-necked geeks can intimidate me online?  Think back to your exper!
<br>
ience, if you can, and I'm sure you will realize better.  I have posted 1200 emails here before; I will do it again, under 1200 different addies, if necessary. It is YOU who are breaking the rules here, and I will remind you of that forEVER.  How's THAT for an immortalist stance?
