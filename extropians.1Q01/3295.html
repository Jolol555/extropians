<p>Ja, Ill likely stop posting anything on this topic until I can figure out
<br>
a self-consistent postion.  I dont see how the legal restriction against
<br>
recordings of activities on private property will actually prevent
<br>
recordings on private property.
<br>
<p>When they outlaw cameras only outlaws will have cameras.
<br>
<p>Its a hell of a dilemma: video is a great tool to keep police from
<br>
misbehaving, but those cams are coming into our backyards, carried
<br>
by various beasts, set up by hobbyists, etc.  It really isnt all that
<br>
clear how to defeat that, especially if one hasnt a lot of money
<br>
to throw at it.  spike
