I just re-read the whole thread. I should have read what I wrote a
<br>
second time before accusing you of mixing up things. I didn't write as
<br>
clearly as I could have. I am sorry.

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; I am not opposed to doing anything that works. Anders Sandberg (are you

<em>&gt; Sleeping Beauty. Time for a re-post, maybe?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But beware--there are big words. Even so, I bet I could tell the story
</em><br>

<em>&gt; that they were old enough to understand.

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I once saw a couple of &quot;professional educators&quot; simper condescendingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at me as they watched me explain the word &quot;metaphor&quot; to a five year old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They &quot;knew better&quot; than to tell a five year old a word like that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why was I explaining the word? Because she'd just criticized something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd said, saying &quot;Not _really_.&quot; And I agreed. &quot;No, not _really_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really. They call it a metaphor.&quot; &quot;What's _that_?&quot; So I told her. And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; told her what the difference between a metaphor and a fib was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; She used the word five times within the next week. On her own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On the contrary, I recently used the word on the telephone with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; twelve-year-old. Her response was &quot;Don't use such big words; remember,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm only in *public* school.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I hardly think an honest response to a question about bacteria destroys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense of wonder. And I weep for the upbringing of the twelve-year-old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is an ordinary five-year-old supposed to be told fairy tales when she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; asks for an explanation about why she's supposed to brush her teeth? Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;tickling her imagination&quot;, in this instance, what is called for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Are you assuming too much, perhaps?
