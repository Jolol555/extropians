One day, we'll take over the world...

&nbsp;Dyslexia didn't stop Ben Way from making a fortune in the communications
<br>
industry before he was 20, says Cassandra Jardine
<br>
&quot;I have heard of various cures, but, oh God, I would never want to rewire
<br>
my brain.
<br>
&quot;It isn't about having a good visual imagination, or becoming good at
<br>
extracting the essential point to make up for poor short-term memory. I
<br>
can describe what I mean only by telling you what it feels like when I
<br>
have an idea.
<br>
&quot;One week of every month I'm awake most of the night, thinking. Sometimes
<br>
I can feel myself having an idea, intense activity on both sides of my
<br>
brain and then, 'whoosh', it all comes together like a whirring candyfloss
<br>
machine, turning in my head, making connections from all over the place.
<br>
In an hour, I find I can see the solution to a problem.
<br>
&quot;Once or twice, I have found myself having an idea so powerful that it is
<br>
a truly bizarre feeling. On both occasions, I have had the idea that has
<br>
been the basis for my next business.&quot;
