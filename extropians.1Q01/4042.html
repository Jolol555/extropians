Robin asks,
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyone seen the answer to this question:  On how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes do two typical humans differ?
</em><br>
<p>I don't have exact numbers to hand, but Futuyama cites large mammals
<br>
as being heterozygous (having different genes) at 3.7% of allozymes.  That
<br>
means 3.7% of the time your two alleles produce proteins of significantly
<br>
different motility.  Since most variants are rare, two people would differ
<br>
at about 7% of loci; with 30,000 loci now estimated for the human population
<br>
that's a floor of 2,100 genes.  It will be higher as most changes aren't
<br>
electrophoretically detectable.
<br>
<p>There is a catch with non-protein-coding regulatory regions.  We keep finding
<br>
more of them, more types of them, they are not readily identified, and they
<br>
vary far more than coding regions.  There  could be a lot of variability 
<br>
&quot;hidden&quot;
<br>
there; I think two unrelated human by that criterion might differ at almost
<br>
all loci.
<br>

<em>&gt;Even if we know on how many places people can differ potentially, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not answer Robin's question, which is on how many of those places
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two randomly chosen people would actually differ.  No doubt it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depend on how closely related the people are, and perhaps on whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are from the same part of the world or the same ethnic group.
</em><br>
<p>Ethnicity and geography turn out to be minor influences on human
<br>
coding polymorphism, explaining only about 10% of variation.  So, to 
<br>
first approximations, you can ignore it.  However, if those regulatory
<br>
region polymorphisms turn out to be important, then that will change;
<br>
sharing an entire gene will become rare unless you are related to
<br>
the person.
