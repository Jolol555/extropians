|To be technical, the man in the middle attack is not an &quot;attack&quot; 
<br>
|against an existing securely established relationship.  It is a form 
<br>
|of fraud or con wherein one is persuaded to set up a new secure 
<br>
|relationship with someone untrustworthy.  That means that if you 
<br>
|personally know someone and set up proper secure communications with 
<br>
|them, the man-in-the-middle con cannot break it (theoretically).
<br>
<p>[...Excellent summary of the Middle Men, Inc., attack deleted...]
<br>
<p>Note: &quot;set up proper secure communications with them&quot; means &quot;meet them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in person and exchange keys, and then use these keys to set up
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an encrypted communication link with them&quot;.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, one can not do that without getting their key _in_person_.
<br>
<p>If one uses some kind of network access, the Middle Men, Inc., can intercept
<br>
the message, change it to insert themselves into the loop, and break the
<br>
security.
<br>
<p>EXAMPLE. If one wish to e-trade with Some Company, Ltd., then there exist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently _no_ methods to make certain that the Middle Men, Inc.,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not intercept the connection, insert their own false data, or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever. Encrypted communication _only_ works if somebody gives
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their key to you in person.
<br>
<p>If your system administrator gives you a security token, like a Kerberos
<br>
password or some key, then you can use that token to connect to your system
<br>
over an insecure network. But if you don't have a key to begin with, then
<br>
you lose.
<br>
<p>And if you wish to engage in e-trade with some entity which you don't meet
<br>
in person, then somebody can have broken the communication security and
<br>
you lose. And you would not even notice it.
<br>
<p>If you have created a secure communication link, then you can of course
<br>
use it to change the key. The problem appears the first time you wish to
<br>
engage in secure communication.
<br>
<p>You must have somebody you trust to give you a key. I detect no such
<br>
entities on the Internet today.
<br>
<p>|I do not believe any amount of technology on the communications pipe 
<br>
|will be able to solve the problem of untrustworthy humans on the 
<br>
|other end.  A different solution for trusting or controlling business 
<br>
|partners would need to be found.
<br>
<p>True, but then you describe Yet Another Problem (YAP).
<br>
<p>|One possible solution for some cases would be full anonymous cash. 
<br>
|If you could do business anonymously and still get paid, you wouldn't 
<br>
|care what the person did on the other end.  In this case, you 
<br>
|wouldn't need your messages to be encrypted, merely that your 
<br>
|messages could not be traced back to you.  This is a different 
<br>
|solution to a different problem, but might solve some business 
<br>
|requirements for e-business.
<br>
<p>Anonymous cash fixes the vendor's problem but not the buyer's problem.
<br>
<p>The vendor gets anonymous cash, and thus gets paid.
<br>
But the buyer cannot really know the vendor will deliver anything.
<br>
<p>Unless they meet in person, naturally.
