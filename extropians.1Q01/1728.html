Reminds me of the power situation in CA :-) Hope you guys don't get regulated
<br>
out of existence. Actually I don't think it would affect me at all directly
<br>
if my local phone company went bankrupt... even my T1 local loop is via the
<br>
local cable company. Of course it would seriously disrupt the services and
<br>
businesses of the city I live in.

<em>&gt; &gt;Ok then look at this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://lw.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?Section=Artic">http://lw.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?Section=Artic</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;les&amp;SubSection=Display&amp;ARTICLE_ID=87762&amp;VERSION_NUM=1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It's an article on how fiber to the home is happening today, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a 100mbit ethernet link into the house.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;Disclaimer: My opinions are my own, I do not speak for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SBC/Ameritech&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're on the same wavelength Brian, I was reading that same article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yesterday when I visited the site. ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our problem isn't technological, its political.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10 years ago I was part of a very ambitious project who's mission
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement was to have fiber installed at every Ameritech site by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the year 2000. As I said, then the long distance companies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaccess carriers, cable companies, state and federal regulators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got involved, regulated the crap out of us and killed the deal. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they've been bitching at us ever since, wanting to know when we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to build it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's my personal brief synopsis of the result of these regulatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we were to build a fiber network:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) We can't charge the ratepayers for doing so, the expense would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to come out of our profits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COMMENTARY: This alone wasn't the deal killer, we were still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to do this, but they weren't done yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) 80% of the bandwidth was reserved for competitors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COMMENTARY: Not only was 80% of the bandwidth reserved for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitors, but under the pricing plan, they could get access for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than we charged ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) The RBOC's are prevented from entering any new business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COMMENTARY: We currently are restricted to local service only, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you want to call another customer 50 miles away, by law it has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go via either an interaccess carrier, or a long distance carrier,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we cannot by law complete that call ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not only are we still barred from long distance, but effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barred from any other value added business that might actually be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth getting into the fiber business for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) The &quot;competitors&quot; have a say-so in the deployment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COMMENTARY: Yep, not only are we subsidizing our so-called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition, but THEY get to decide when and where we are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be allowed to deploy it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So now you have my personal opinion as to why we're not living in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fiber-optic wonderland.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're standing here with our hands cuffed behind our backs, gagged,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blindfolded, with corks in our ears, a hood over our heads, wrapped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head to toe in chains, our feet cast in concrete, suspended from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crane over lake Michigan..... and people want to know &quot;Why haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they built a fiber network yet? Don't they get it?&quot;
</em><br>
