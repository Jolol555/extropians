<p><em>&gt; Question/problem: if physical immortality arrives, with attendant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to cure gross defects like dementia and senility, but stagnates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at that ability level for some length of time, would most people decay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into conservative, nostalgic sheeple who use their collected wisdom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth to struggle to keep things the way they are, viewing young humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and robots (sentient or not) equally as slaves laboring to support them?
</em><br>
<p>There seem to be a correlation with a constructive, self actualizing
<br>
personality and living long and active lives. Most likely you need the
<br>
personality to survive long enough and keep your brain plastic to
<br>
avoid dementia. Given advances in life extension it might turn out
<br>
that this personality trait also is needed to seek out and use the
<br>
methods for extending life. Unless we get an &quot;immortality in a pill&quot;
<br>
procedure it is likely that life extension will require plenty of
<br>
customer participation.
<br>
<p>In some sense learning is getting better estimates of the grand
<br>
probability distribution of the universe - the likeliehood of
<br>
situations of kind A to become situations of kind B and so on. Age
<br>
allows us to acquire more data for our personal estimates of how
<br>
things are. The general knowledge acquired this way about very general
<br>
properties of reality are called 'wisdom'. In a changing environment
<br>
we need to be plastic and update our estimates over time (learning
<br>
which fields are changing and which are more static); this is why old
<br>
have been held in high esteem beside their rarity in most societies -
<br>
they were likely knowledgeable - and why in our current dynamic
<br>
societies they are less relevant. 
<br>
<p>In a future with life extension control over mental plasticity is
<br>
going to be cruicial, but maintaining a proper mindshape is going to
<br>
be a careful balance. Too much plasticity, and you forget your past
<br>
and your personality will drift, too little and you become a
<br>
struldbrug. Again, the mindset will be important to chose the right
<br>
methods and way of handling it personally.
