</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mathers, that we should strive to be &quot;more than human.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That's fine, but it's also too vague to be useful. I've provided at least a 
<br>
more clearly circumscribed definition. In using terms like &quot;posthuman&quot; I 
<br>
try to stick to science, and in biology &quot;human&quot; or rather &quot;homo sapiens 
<br>
sapiens&quot; is tied to being part of a particular gene pool. It makes sense to 
<br>
me to define posthuman as a condition in which the limits to lifespan, 
<br>
cognitive function, psychological function, and so on, have passed beyond 
<br>
what is allowed by unaltered human genes. Simply believing that you are 
<br>
posthuman, on this view, makes no sense. And I am not at all convinced that 
<br>
you have provided a useful alternative definition. You are certainly free 
<br>
to use the term in any way you want. But some stipulative definitions are 
<br>
more useful than others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I scanned your Web site and did not see any definition of &quot;posthuman&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;HERE IT IS FROM <a href="http://www.multi.co.uk/identity.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/identity.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>I read this, and still did not see anything that resembles a definition. I 
<br>
take it that by calling yourself a posthuman you simply mean that you 
<br>
*believe* yourself to be different--in ways I don't see clearly 
<br>
specified--from other people. You do say that &quot;My claim to be &quot;post-human&quot; 
<br>
is irrefutable, since I know my mind and identity better than any outside 
<br>
observer. The longer and more strongly that I continue to make this claim, 
<br>
the more congruent, thus persuasive it becomes, both to myself and others.&quot; 
<br>
This suggests to me that being posthuman, according to your usage, has 
<br>
everything to do with belief, and little or nothing to do with an actual 
<br>
condition. I think it functions something like my concept of one's &quot;optimal 
<br>
persona&quot;, except that I intend the latter as a constantly moving goal 
<br>
rather than a state that one claims to have attained.
<br>
<p>The longer you claim to be posthuman, the more strongly you may believe it, 
<br>
but that doesn't make it true. I can spend the next 20 years claiming that 
<br>
I am the greatest mathematician in the world. I may convince myself, but it 
<br>
will not be true. The only way I can see your claim being true is if you 
<br>
define &quot;posthuman&quot; as &quot;someone is posthuman if and only if they call 
<br>
themselves posthuman&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The WMT debated Darwinism and the effect that evolution theory would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on traditional, mystical, systems .. and  theoretical magick has made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adjustment and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advances in the light of science ... there is no ideological conflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science and chaos magik or techno-paganism .... Dr. John Dee (astrologer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to Eliz 1 &amp; founder of Enochian system) was professor of mathematics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;navigation after all ..... Natural Magic is just experimental psychology.
</em><br>
<p>I am completely unmoved by your noting that Dee was both an astrologer and 
<br>
a mathematician. I could add other examples: Pythagoras was a great 
<br>
mathematician, but also ran a cult in Greece that believed that beans had 
<br>
souls and should not be eaten. The great physicist Sir. Isaac Newton spent 
<br>
half his time doing biblical numerology. The fact that these people were 
<br>
smart in one area does not mean they made sense in other areas. Astrology 
<br>
is bunk. Numerology is bunk. As for &quot;chaos magik&quot; (I believe it is usually 
<br>
spelled &quot;magick&quot;) or &quot;techno-paganism&quot;, I might agree with you that there 
<br>
is or need be no conflict, but you would have to specify more precisely 
<br>
what you are including in those terms. Meditation, visualization, use of 
<br>
certain archetypes for purely symbolic purposes is not at odds with science.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;I have to assume that you are using some odd meaning of the term utterly at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;odds with how it's used within transhumanist circles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, this might be true. I usually end up arguing with trans-humanist lists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But the point is that my definition has more utility than theirs ..... there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not just a single view of the future .. and I claim to be most advanced in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theoretical and natural magic (which includes ACTIVE Divination &amp; prophecy)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there has been for 100's of years ...
</em><br>
<p>As I argue above, the contrary is true. I think your usage of &quot;posthuman&quot; 
<br>
has *less* utility, since it labels people as posthuman who are 
<br>
biologically indistinguishable from humans, have the same neural 
<br>
architecture, etc. As for divination and prophecy, let's see the evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Evolution must be spiritually onwards, not just smarter TV sets, to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our balance. If you ignore possibilities for mystical experience, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your loss (and supernaturalism doesn't come into it).
</em><br>
<p>If you're read any of my writing, you would know that I agree that 
<br>
spiritual progress is important. I don't use the term &quot;mystical&quot; since it 
<br>
suggests a means of cognition that I have no evidence for accepting as real 
<br>
(that is, as more than a purely internal conviction not based on external 
<br>
reality). Spiritual development, including having a clear and developing 
<br>
sense of purpose, a broad perspective on possibilities for oneself and 
<br>
others, continuing refinement in personality, emotional responses, and 
<br>
maturity are all part of extropic development. Please don't try to position 
<br>
me as someone who champions solely technological progress.
<br>
<p>FYI, I have studied numerous occult, magical, and ancient traditions, 
<br>
including the Kabbalah, Golden Dawn and other forms of ritual magick, 
<br>
various forms of meditation including TM, dowsing, &quot;astral projection&quot;, 
<br>
Rosicrucian thinking (to put it charitably), the I Ching, and more. Once I 
<br>
entered the age of reason, I came to realize that most of this stuff is 
<br>
bunk. I still find a place for meditation (minus the TM people's claims of 
<br>
sidhis or special powers such as levitation and invisibility), for 
<br>
breathing exercises, and I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt to 
<br>
acupuncture (but not to &quot;chakras&quot;) and perhaps to hypnotherapy.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Have you overcome the limits of aging and death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, these are the traditional goals of the Adept.
</em><br>
<p>You see, this is the kind of claim that makes me think that was you are 
<br>
saying is simply rubbish. You're making an extraordinary claim. You provide 
<br>
no evidence for it. This makes me doubt that we can really have a 
<br>
worthwhile discussion about this. I am sure that you have *not* halted the 
<br>
aging process. I am sure that, barring major technological breakthroughs of 
<br>
the kind that Extropians encourage, you will die of disease or old age. 
<br>
What exactly *are* you claiming in your assertion?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;Have you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reshaped yourself physically, cognitively, and psychologically so that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are no longer remotely human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course, I understand MVT! My psychology is pretty unique.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But we are still &quot;remotely&quot; ape-like in appearance, and I must appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remotely human and use your crummy languages in order to communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with you .....
</em><br>
<p>Like your claim to have overcome aging and death, I do not believe you. My 
<br>
most charitable interpretation is that you are taking my question to mean 
<br>
&quot;have you managed to change some of your beliefs so that you think a bit 
<br>
differently than many humans&quot;. But that is *not* what I meant, as would be 
<br>
obvious from everything I've written. Have you changed your brain structure 
<br>
so that your intelligence now exceeds that of any human being? Have you 
<br>
reorganizing your neural system so that you can consciously access parts of 
<br>
your brain impossible for any human to access? Can you see in infrared and 
<br>
ultraviolet? Do you have nanobots cruising your bloodstream ensuring that 
<br>
your immune system can demolish all known pathogens?
<br>
<p>As for MVT: NLP, meditation, and some of the other techniques you use I 
<br>
think can be useful. I'm extremely skeptical about &quot;dreamwork&quot;, and think 
<br>
&quot;chakra work&quot; is nonsense if it means anything more than meditating by 
<br>
focusing on an imaginary point. Frankly, one reason I'm taking the time to 
<br>
write this post, is that I've been bothered by your exaggerated claims 
<br>
combined with your use of &quot;posthuman&quot; and your linking of it to MVT. You've 
<br>
called MVT &quot;the all-conquering philosophy!&quot;, and you said &quot;Ha! Your 
<br>
delusions of adequacy
<br>
are wholly unfounded unless you have a stronger view than MVT.&quot; All this 
<br>
sounds painfully like Neo-Tech.
<br>
<p>You also made literally incredible claims -- claims that I don't like 
<br>
seeing linked to our movement. For instance, you said in an earlier post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Longevity is hardly a new pursuit (read the Yellow Emperor's Classic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Taoist medicine). The founder of the Rosicrucian's (Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rosencreutz) reputedly lived 5 or 600 years, and there is a tradition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of magickal adepts and alchemists living an incredibly long time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Enoch (or Edris of the Jin) who 'lived with God and was not' also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lived for 700 odd years ... and presumably passed his magickal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skills to his son Methuselah .... I read the Book of the Secret of Enoch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for clues, but the jury is out on whether I can clock up as many years as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Enoch.
</em><br>
<p>This goes along with your claim above that you have conquered aging and 
<br>
death. It strongly suggests that you mean this literally. In which case, 
<br>
I'm not sure what to say to you without sounding insulting. Surely you 
<br>
don't believe these mythical life spans? Surely you don't think you have 
<br>
conquered aging without the use of technology? (If you do, I challenge you 
<br>
to get all your biomarkers tested at the Kronos Clinic in Arizona then we 
<br>
can compare them to your chronological age.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... the very fact that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think you are (human/ transhuman/ posthuman) eventually makes it so ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because in order to carry on thinking that you are demands reaffirming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feedback from others and from events in the world.
</em><br>
<p>Come on now! Attitudes can influence your actions and change outcomes to an 
<br>
extent. Hence the sense of being a practical optimistic (but *not* a 
<br>
passive optimist). But wishing and believing doesn't make something real. 
<br>
You can think you are a posthuman all you like but, according to any 
<br>
sensible definition, you are not. Someone can believe that they are a fried 
<br>
green tomato but thinking that you are will *not* eventually make it so. 
<br>
What it may eventually do is get you placed in a safely padded cell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure, I accept you are transhuman/ Extropian if that's what you call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself and that's what you believe. So why can't you accept that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;am posthuman, since that is what I call myself and what I believe.
</em><br>
<p>If you actually give a definition (not a long Web page vaguely talking 
<br>
about posthuman and MVT but a *definition*) of how you use &quot;posthuman&quot; then 
<br>
I may be happy to grant that you are posthuman in *your* sense. What I am 
<br>
arguing is that your sense of the term, in so far as I can find any content 
<br>
in it, is not a useful one. It has absolutely no relation to what it means 
<br>
to be human, and so saying that you are posthuman will mislead people. Your 
<br>
view is completely different from how we use transhuman and posthuman. Yet 
<br>
you use the Web domain extropia.net, which will confuse people into 
<br>
thinking that your view is related. NOW do you understand why all this 
<br>
bothers me?
<br>
<p>Alas, all of this discussion may be pointless since, on January 1, you 
<br>
declared that all philosophy is invalid. My comments have been 
<br>
philosophical as have yours. So, according to your own views, all my 
<br>
comments are invalid. And so are yours.
<br>
<p>I've said all I want to say on this, so I will try not to respond further. 
<br>
I have a conference that I should be organizing.
<br>
<p>Steve, while I think that a substantial portion of your ideas are unfounded 
<br>
and wrong-headed, we do seem to be on the same wavelength on some important 
<br>
matters. Please do not take my critical comments to be a complete rejection 
<br>
of your whole approach. As is typical in email communications, I have 
<br>
chosen to focus on things that I think are indefensible rather than on 
<br>
things that I agree with.
<br>
<p>Onward!
