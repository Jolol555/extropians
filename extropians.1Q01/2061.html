<p>
To live in a world that &quot;the most they can do is punch you in the face?&quot;
<br>
<p>You would have to live in a world of toothless quadriplegics on a flat 
<br>
featureless plain.
<br>
<p>There are 300 lb monsters that if they punched you in the face.. let alone 
<br>
kicked or strangled you.. would revoke your right to any opinions 
<br>
immediately.
<br>
<p>Ever since the big cave man threatened to crush the skull of the little cave 
<br>
man, and the little cave man picked up a rock in defense, some other little 
<br>
cave men whined that rocks should be banished because some cave man might 
<br>
bash them with it.
