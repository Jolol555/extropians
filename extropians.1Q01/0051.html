<p>Hey, I know this is an Extropian list, but not everything has an Extropian
<br>
angle -- or, at least, one that is interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know we were all supposed to appreciate the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a virtual world, but if you liked it for the martial arts sequences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I highly recommend Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't appreciate &quot;The Matrix&quot; for that.  After all, it's nothing more
<br>
than a rehash of Philip K. Dick or &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes on that mark.  I
<br>
did like the special effects and the action.
<br>
<p>As for the Ang Lee film, it was much the same.  The story was okay -- not up
<br>
to Lee's standards.  (Compare it to &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; or &quot;Sense and
<br>
Sensibility.&quot;)  But the fight scenes took martial arts films to the next
<br>
level as you point out elsewhere.  The only thing that I can think of that
<br>
is close are anime martial arts.  (I just saw &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; and some
<br>
of the fight scenes had that feel.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This movie takes martial arts action to the next level.  Characters in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crouching Tiger run up walls, across water, and leap hundreds of feet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the air,
</em><br>
<p>It was more like dozens of feet.:)
<br>
<p>Other than that, I did not find the characters all that convincing.  A
<br>
beautifully done film with some serious flaws.
<br>
<p>Happy New Day!
