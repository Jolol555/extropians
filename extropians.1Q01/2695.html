</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  Free basics in exchange for non-reproduction.  The
<br>
free food would contain birth control medications.  Everyone
<br>
wins: society could offer educational benefits, shelter, food, you
<br>
name it, and even the conservative element would gain some
<br>
enthusiasm.  The medications would be non-permanent, so that
<br>
if the recipients get with it and row their own boat, then they
<br>
can after a few months bear litters of pups.  What we still need
<br>
is a medication that makes the men temporarily sterile.  Ive heard
<br>
such a thing exists, dont know the details.
<br>
<p>Actually, when you think it over, we could remake prison colonies
<br>
this way, for those who are serving life terms.  Delete the death
<br>
penalty, create a prison colony where men and women can live
<br>
together in a roach-motel kinda city, difference being everyone
<br>
there is sterile.  Im sure the prisoners would opt for it in a second.
<br>
The main hitch is that there are probably at least 20 to 1 men to women
<br>
doing life.  That colony would be worse than the Silicon Valley.
<br>
<p>The ladies need not fear mistreatment in such an arrangement:
<br>
as in the old west, even the most inferior examples of womanhood
<br>
would be well protected from those who would do them harm.
<br>
Now, perhaps the guys would kill each other over the few ladies
<br>
available.  Duelling would likely be common.  spike
