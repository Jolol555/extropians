<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Hofstadter's _Le Ton Beau de Marot_ is about interpretation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;translation...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Amara Graps wrote:  OK, I'm convinced. Now this is a future book for me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; read.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Le Ton is tough going, unless you are a specialist in translation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of course.  There was too much there about which I havent a clue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being strictly mono.
</em><br>
<p>I think I would enjoy this book. You see, even though I'm lousy at
<br>
languages, I'm still fascinated by them. (My library of language books
<br>
has doubled in volume during the last few years)
<br>
<p>It has also become obvious to me, now, from this discussion, that in my
<br>
literature world, I'm only scratching the surface of the meaning of
<br>
the words I'm reading from foreign authors, because I'm not reading the
<br>
words in their original language, or else it's translated,
<br>
and possibly translated poorly. So I have more motivation to
<br>
become more proficient in languages.
<br>
<p>Here is another wierdly-translated text. You would think it would
<br>
translate easily, because it's a children's rhyme, right? Wrong.
<br>
Here the translator sacrificed the meaning(?) of the poem for
<br>
keeping the *rhyme intact*.

Alice's Adventures n Wonderland &amp; Through the Looking Glass
<br>
by Lewis Carroll
<br>
<p>(Annotated version by Martin Gardner. BTW: this is the
<br>
best version of Alice in Wonderland, EVER)
<br>
<p>(If you are looking for this poem, Spike, you should find it
<br>
easily, because it is next to the chess set in the beginning of
<br>
Through the Looking Glass)
<br>
<p><p>Child of the pure unclouded brow
<br>
And dreaming eyes of wonder!
<br>
Though time be fleet, and I and thou
<br>
Are half a life asunder

Thy loving smile will surely hail
<br>
The love-gift of a fairy-tale

Taps tevim davinats sis stasts.
<br>
<p>What is this? Even though my Latvian is pretty bad, I know
<br>
enough from my Latvian dictionaries and grammar books that the
<br>
translator transposed two of the lines. Her version goes
<br>
sort of like this:
<br>
<p>Child of mine with pure sight
<br>
and eyes full of wonder                [what happend to dreaming?]
<br>
Partly around(?) it was all different long ago
<br>
Time changes quickly, to say to me     [where's thou?]
<br>
For years something(?) close to me
<br>
(?Taps not in dict) dearly presents this story
<br>
<p>I know my version is baaaaaad too, but I hope that you get the point
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
<p>For fun, if you wish to see more of how the Latvian language looks
<br>
(without the diacritical marks)
