that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Directed evolution does not merit attention unless there is good

</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention all by itself.
</em><br>
<p>Regarding evidence for directed evolution, one would need a way of testing
<br>
such hypothesis.  This is why I posted &quot;Testing Evolutionary Explanations&quot;
<br>
(see <a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Testing.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Testing.html</a>).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This something we can't see yet is another way of saying we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for any such or reason to pay attention to it before there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any such reason.
</em><br>
<p>I think the case for directed evolution is a lot stronger than mere
<br>
speculation.  Brooks and Wiley believe current &quot;[e]volutionary theory has
<br>
not come to grips with the apparent lawlike behavior of biological systems.&quot;
<br>
(_Evolution as Entropy_ 2/e, p3)  An example of this is size increase in
<br>
life forms.  The biggest organisms seem to be bigger over time.  The sequoia
<br>
of today is much bigger than any tree species that lived previously.  The
<br>
blue whale is much bigger than the biggest dinosaurs.  (For vertebrates,
<br>
such increases have been dubbed instances of Cope's rule.  See the Bonner
<br>
book mentioned below, p28.)
<br>
<p>Note: by directed evolution or orthogenesis is _not_ meant that some mind is
<br>
directing it.  It just means that evolution has a direction -- at least, in
<br>
some cases.  The cause of this could be no more mystifying that
<br>
self-organization.  (See Stuart A. Kauffman's _The Origins of Order:
<br>
Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution_.  Kauffman is Mr.
<br>
Self-Organization in evolutionary circles.)
<br>
<p>Of course, a lot of work has been done since they wrote that.  I bring up
<br>
the above examples because they point to a trend in evolution -- a
<br>
direction.  John Tyler Bonner, in his _The Evolution of Complexity by Means
<br>
of Natural Selection_ (published the same year as the Brooks-Wiley work),
<br>
offers an adaptive explanation of size increase.  He argues that size
<br>
increase allows organisms to enter spaces where competition is less.  (p33)
<br>
a larger organism usually is, e.g., harder to hunt or kill.  Lions don't
<br>
hunt elephants...
<br>
<p>He also argues that size increases can help an organism become less
<br>
dependent on the immediate environment.  (Chapter 3)  Smaller organisms,
<br>
e.g., usually live shorter lives, can't store as much food, change more in
<br>
tune with their environment (think of heat storage in larger forms), and so
<br>
on.  (See also Jennifer A. Kitchell's &quot;The Reciprocal Interaction of
<br>
Organism and Effective Environment:  Learning More about 'And'&quot; in _Causes
<br>
of Evolution: A Paleontological Perspective_.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there are quite good lists and resources dedicated to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions already.
</em><br>
<p>Please name them!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is it good or worthwhile to discuss it in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable detail (and it does get detailed really rapidly if it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth the bandwidth) here on this list?
</em><br>
<p>We all have our reasons for bringing up stuff here.  I think, however, the
<br>
direct relation to extropianism and transhumanism is that both those idea
<br>
systems have notions, vague or no, on the future evolution of life and
<br>
humanity.  So understanding evolutionary theory and history might give us
<br>
some perspective on all of this.
<br>
<p>Of course, it seems to have gone the way of most threads here.  People
<br>
telling jokes.  People attacking each other's character and intelligence.
<br>
Etc.  If I were cynical -- and I am -- I'd just say this is the usual
<br>
direction of this list.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
