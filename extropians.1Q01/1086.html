<p>Cool!  Thanks Mike.  I fooled with designs for several years
<br>
for VTOL aircraft.  I am in the Society of Aerospace Weight
<br>
Engineers.  At the conferences, the latest VTOL and STOVL
<br>
concepts are the most common topic of discussion.
<br>
<p>I messed around for years with the idea of a pivoting single
<br>
engine single rotor craft within a lifting surface.  It kinda
<br>
looked like a flying saucer of sorts, but I never could figure out
<br>
a practical way to cancel the torque.  Consequently the only
<br>
convincing small VTOL craft designs are dual rotor and end
<br>
up looking a lot like a scaled down version of the V22 {thus
<br>
my personal interest in the Osprey}.
<br>
<p>My calcs show that a scaled down version of a V22 could be
<br>
built large enough to haul one person, however it has some
<br>
pretty severe practicality and safety related compromises, such as:
<br>
<p>1) The two rotors are not geared together as in the V22, thus
<br>
if either engine fails, the probability of survival is low.  If one
<br>
pays the weight penalty for variable pitch rotors, then there
<br>
remains some possibility of surviving an engine-out landing,
<br>
at the expense of a large fraction of the payload capacity.
<br>
<p>2) The range is short since the fuel hauling capacity is not high,
<br>
and the engines large and thirsty.
<br>
<p>3) The short legged landing gear necessitated by weight
<br>
constraints makes a conventional landing impossible for
<br>
two reasons: the wheels are very small and also the rotors
<br>
would  strike the ground).
<br>
<p>4) If I calculated correctly (and its possible I didn't) then
<br>
if one were to go full throttle in horizontal flight mode
<br>
the wings could tear off.  This one Im not at all sure about.
<br>
<p>5) As with the V22, the transition between horizontal to
<br>
vertical flight modes is very do-wrongable, even with an
<br>
experienced pilot.
<br>
<p>The most convincing looking design is that dual rotor
<br>
air-cowboy thing those two local guys are working on.
