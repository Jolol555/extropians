<p>Hi Dan
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; be continually modified ... then it is dead meat. And if it is
</em><br>
continually
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; modified, then it cannot ever be formulated ......  so why bother?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This can be said about any theory or idea.  You seem to be assuming either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge is final and perfect or it's totally unacceptable.  Why science?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why technology?  Why case-by-case rejection?  Why anything?
</em><br>
<p>Yeh, I think we should keep (unproven) conjecture to a minimum except
<br>
for purposes of floating ideas to be shot down in discussion. Ideas are
<br>
fine in dialectic processes, but when dealing with the world we should
<br>
deal wiv concrete facts as we find them, and not thru a hypothetical
<br>
remove.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;By what means does one &quot;to judge issues on a case-by-case, situationalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(posthuman aesthetic) way?&quot;  That would seem to mean to me an implicit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;tacit political philosophy as opposed to an explicit one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The latter is easier to examine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fossils are easy to examine, this is true.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Just because something isn't explicated, doesn't mean it's alive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thriving.  I tend to think that making assumptions visible and tacit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge more verbal, one is better able to examine it.
</em><br>
<p>Fossils just an example .... things easier to examine once have stopped
<br>
moving around, in post-mortem, when they can be dissected. This is
<br>
not always useful though .... Turning it around, ideas can  also be harder
<br>
to examine than events/ situations that present in the world. Why bother
<br>
with extra levels of examination, more than needed, why not just cut to
<br>
the quick?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;(Also, I think such &quot;case-by-case&quot; thinking is just how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the average person and politician approaches matters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course it must be ..... politicians in practice find they cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stick to their cumbersome political theories.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I think what is more likely is they find their rhetoric prevents their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desire for more power or to get along from coming to fruition.  The same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applies to nonpoliticians.  Being able to ignore principles gives one an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easy out when they become a nuisance to getting along with other people or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avoid a bad conscience.  It's easy to say, &quot;Stealing is wrong&quot; and then
</em><br>
when
<br>
<em>&gt;one takes home office supplies from work justifying that as not really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stealing and pointing out how we must judge each theft on a case-by-case
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basis before deciding if it's truly theft.:)
</em><br>
<p>But &quot;stealing is wrong&quot;, period, doesn't allow exceptions like stealing a
<br>
sheep
<br>
off a rich landowner to feed your starving family. Also  principles can come
<br>
into conflict. So you still have to deal wiv things on a case-by-case even
<br>
when you have principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure what you mean here, but certainly, a priori offence at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art is a 'political' theory rather than a case-by-case aesthetic
</em><br>
judgement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't think of this as a &quot;'political' theory.&quot;  Perhaps a definition is
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt;order here.  What do you mean by political theory?
</em><br>
<p>This wasn't my example ... no, as you say it isn't political theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I have deliberately never tried to compile any &quot;Posthuman Principles&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; though because I *do* distrust (or rather, see little point in) UNIVERSAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catch-all linguistic formulations that are independent of any empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;test
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or evidence.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;But isn't that a rule in action above?  You seem to be using as your rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;empirical test[s] or evidence&quot; as your touchstone, so you are not really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;throwing out theory, just saying you are.
</em><br>
<p>Implicit rule, maybe or maybe not. I want to reduce theory as much
<br>
as practicable ... as a pragmatist I do not *rule out* rules in all
<br>
circumstances ... that would be to make the same error I am
<br>
accusing others of making! Let's just minimise them .....
