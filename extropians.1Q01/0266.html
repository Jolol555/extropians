<br>
<em>&gt; Your &quot;definition&quot; does not offer a test by which to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classify things into or out of this category called &quot;philosophy&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I no longer believe in this ghost you call &quot;philosophy.&quot; It sounds like a
<br>
kluge made to bridge the gap between religion and science. The first time
<br>
I heard the definition of philosophy as &quot;the art of asking the wrong
<br>
questions&quot; it seemed to me an accurate description. (In case you didn't
<br>
know it, my favorite definition of philosophy is a take-off on Abraham
<br>
Joshua Keschel's definition... &quot;Philosophy may be defined as the art of
<br>
asking the right questions...&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For a proper definition, you need to expand on what makes a question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;wrong&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that would be philosophical... and a waste of time.
<br>
Everyone knows what wrong means, but philosophy attempts to prove the
<br>
incredible by an appeal to the unintelligible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also need to decide if you are really claiming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only philosophy produces &quot;wrong&quot; questions.
</em><br>
<p>You're getting extremely imaginative here. The statement that &quot;philosophy
<br>
is the art of asking the wrong questions&quot; does not imply that only
<br>
philosophy produces wrong questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If not, then you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use this as the definition of philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>It's not *the* definition of philosophy. It's my favorite definition. The
<br>
official definition (of course) comes from Ambrose Bierce: &quot;Philosophy, n.
<br>
A route of many roads leading from nowhere to nothing.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would only be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attribute which is shared with other non-philosophical fields.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition must describe what is unique only to philosophy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguishes it from fields that are not philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>Right. The same is true of phlogiston. This kind of definition would only
<br>
be an attribute which is shared with other non-phlogiston fields. A
<br>
definition must describe what is unique only to phlogiston that
<br>
distinguishes it from fields that are not phlogiston.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is wrong with a basic dictionary definition of philosophy?
</em><br>
<p>The dictionary has (so far) failed to include the information that
<br>
philosophy is a hypothesis that can be variously defined to fit the times
<br>
in which it finds its advocates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on-line American Heritage Dictionary of Cultural Literacy gives the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition below. Is this the kind of philosophy that you claim asks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wrong questions?  Or are you refuting a different kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy?
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me you're asking the wrong questions. That's OK, you're an
<br>
accomplished philosopher. Before there was science, there was philosophy.
<br>
So, I don't see how philosophy can be the &quot;study that attempts to discover
<br>
the fundamental principles of the sciences&quot; since the sciences came later.
<br>
&quot;Philosophy has the task and the opportunity of helping banish the concept
<br>
that human destiny here and now is of slight importance in comparison with
<br>
singularitarian destiny,&quot; to paraphrase John Dewey. As Beecher has
<br>
written, &quot;The philosophy of one century is the common sense of the next.&quot;
<br>
While quoting philosophers, I might as well throw in Bertie Russell:
<br>
&quot;Science is what you know, philosophy is what you don't know.&quot;
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.

=====================
<br>
Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind,
<br>
free will
<br>
<p>&quot;It is good that a philosopher should remind himself, now and then, that
<br>
he is a particle pontificating on infinity.&quot; --Will Durant
