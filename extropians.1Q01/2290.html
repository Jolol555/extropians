<p>Exactly how does any such thing follow?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The universe doesn't owe us a living. The wave front from a [hypothetical,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow and exterminate every species on the planet -- just as other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GRBs suffice to sweep the universe of life periodically. If that were to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How is that at all relevant?
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So let's try to derive a concept of rights from this mess ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To start with, all I know is that, pace Descartes, &quot;I think -- therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone is&quot;. (For all I know I'm a simulation in some corner of a much
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;cogito, ergo sum&quot;.) I also know that I want to continue thinking and,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferably, receiving external stimuli that are compatible with my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuing to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How is this relevant?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Solipsism might seem like a rational viewpoint at this stage, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by no means necessary: I know that _I_ exist, I perceive that you match
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my internal model of how a human being might think and communicate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore by Occam's razor it's simplest to conclude that I am just one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a class of entities, and you are another. So I'm not alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Or this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By Occam's razor I can also assume that you posess the same core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation as I do -- to continue thinking and interacting with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So far you have left out almost any analysis of the nature of the
<br>
existents, human beings, except for a rarefied departure from a
<br>
caraciture of Descartes. 
<br>
<p>It is pointless to have a discussion attempting to derive natural rights
<br>
on this basis.
