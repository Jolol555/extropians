<p><em>&gt;My guess is that the same thing will happen with age specific mortality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We will enter a new regime in which the decreases in the past of about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1% per year in mortality may increase to 10% or more per year due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a breakthrough in knowledge.  Biology researchers often claim that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advent of genomics will be so dramatic as to represent a new paradigm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for knowledge growth, so a breakthrough is plausible.
</em><br>
<p>Of course you can't say for sure that we'll break the curve.  But, certainly,
<br>
there are many major developments in the pipeline which at least *could*
<br>
cause major improvements in lifespan, including neoorganogenesis, 
<br>
the anti-glycosylation agent ALT-711, cyborgization of joints and bones,
<br>
and now the possibility of a &quot;calorie restriction&quot; pill with the SIR research.
<br>
Possibly, all 4 could be operational in 20 years.  So while it's true we've
<br>
not proved we can break the curve of previous lifespan extension, no-one
<br>
can legitimately say it's &quot;impossible&quot; or even &quot;highly unlikely&quot;.  Also, these
<br>
possibilities in general are not plausible through standard evolutionary
<br>
scenarios so you can't even say &quot;it's been tried and failed&quot;.
