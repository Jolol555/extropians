THAT would be very cool. Also opening it up to someone other than 
<br>
military contractors accustomed to fabricating test results and cost 
<br>
overruns.

<em>&gt; There was a very good Scientific American last year where they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed various strategies under development that would lower the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, I don't have a reference to the issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the most interesting technologies was a ground based laser 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would fire up into the launch vehicle, super-heating the air 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until it was able to explosively propel the vehicle up up up.  They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had working models and were gradually getting the things to go higher 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and higher.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm reminded of the Internet.  Back in the late 80's, I was using the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet at college for emailing friends in Europe, playing MUDs, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downloading software, etc.  I thought it was the greatest thing, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of my biggest regrets was that I wouldn't have access to it after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I graduated.  I worked for the IT department at school and I knew 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it cost the school tens of thousands of dollars a month to have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that connection.  I just couldn't imagine how the economies of scale 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would ever allow me to have my own personal Internet connection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In less than a decade, as we all know, corporate interests in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet changed everything.  What used to seem impossible is now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonplace.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the same thing will happen with the space industry. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some people will keep chipping away at technologies to get us into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space cheaper and cheaper.  Then, one day, some corporation will find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way to exploit something in space for a profit - maybe weightless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fabrication, or mining asteroids, or something not yet imagined (as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the web was not yet imagined in the late 80's).  From there, you'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see this corporate explosion into space, and economies of scale will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it so affordable that even private citizens of modest means will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to take advantage of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As with the Internet - in a decade or two our whole world will have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed.  You'll look back and wonder how we ever got by without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affordable space travel.
