</em><br>
<p>Thanks for your efforts to keep Extropy Institute keeps costs down.  I
<br>
appreciate them very much.  That said, I also want to see you and Exi become
<br>
wealthy and powerful.  So I'm &quot;thinking out loud&quot; of ways that you might be
<br>
able to increase the money you take in from the conference, yet still keep it
<br>
affordable.
<br>
<p>My suggestions regarding speaking fees were intended to help attract
<br>
individuals who aren't necessarily Extropians, but who've achieved something
<br>
unusual and have at least some sympathies with Extropian thought.   Why do
<br>
this?
<br>
<p>a.  Expand the base of appeal for the conference.  For example, if we could
<br>
get Dave Barry to speak, his presence would draw a lot of people (Barry fans,
<br>
journalists, students) who would likely never have come to an Extropy
<br>
conference.  He'd probably write a column about the experience, exposing the
<br>
conference to a nation-wide audience.
<br>
<p>b.  We could learn from them, and many of them would be entertaining.
<br>
<p>c.  Some small percentage would drink the Kool Aid and become activitists for
<br>
Extropian causes themselves.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;However, individuals like Barry may not be willing to speak for free, because
<br>
they may have no pre-existing knowledge of the Extropy Institute.  Offering a
<br>
speaking fee may increase their motivation to speak.    Of course, once they
<br>
meet all the cool people who come to Exi conference, they will speak at future
<br>
conferences for free...:&gt;
<br>
<p>I understand that the Extropy Institute could not afford to pay speaking
<br>
fees--that's why I suggested the pre-paid speaking fee arrangement in an
<br>
earlier post.  Extropy Institute charges a single price even though different
<br>
individuals may be willing to pay more.  Allowing potential Exi conference
<br>
goers to pre-pay for speakers would allow those who're willing to pay more to
<br>
do so, giving them something in return (influence over the speaker list), yet
<br>
keeps the cost down for those who can't pay more.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the Extropian community is still relatively small, and the
<br>
amounts we could raise for  a speaking fee may be considered insulting by
<br>
potential speakers.   Also, many of the most attractive speakers will likely
<br>
be little motivated by money.  One idea would be to offer to give the money to
<br>
speaker or to the charity of their choice (which could be Exi).  That way, by
<br>
attending the Exi conference they a) raise funds for their favorite charity b)
<br>
get to meet cool people with interesting ideas.
