<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>I've explored a line of thinking regarding the four ancient
<br>
elements:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air, Fire, Earth, and Water.
<br>
<p>The context I've considered is that the symbols of these four
<br>
elements have a very _old_ place (many thousands of years) in
<br>
humans' lives and these four elements are still used today. In a
<br>
scientific sense, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire are not bad symbols
<br>
for the four states of matter -- solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
<br>
<p>I'm intrigued by the widespread use of these symbols. As metaphors.
<br>
The fact that they've been successfully in use for thousands of
<br>
years, makes me wonder why our brains appear to have a preference
<br>
for organizing or categorizing the world with these elements.
<br>
Complementing the categorizing aspect is an &quot;integrating&quot; aspect:
<br>
some religious/spiritual practices use the symbols of the four
<br>
elements to show how one can live a more balanced/integrated life.
<br>
<p>Some Greek history
<br>
<p>The idea of everything being formed of these four elements
<br>
was first developed by the Greek philosopher Empedocles of Sicily.
<br>
Empedocles explains the nature of the universe through the
<br>
interaction of two governing principles, Love and Strife, on the four
<br>
primary elements. Earlier philosophers believed that the quality of
<br>
matter depends on the quantity of a particular element. For example,
<br>
Anaximenes asserts that air is the primary element in the universe,
<br>
condensing to form heavier matter such as water, and rarefying into
<br>
fire. However, Empedocles argues that the quality of matter depends
<br>
exclusively on the *ratio* of its elements. A stone, for example, is
<br>
stone because of a unique ratio of air, fire, earth, and water.
<br>
Empedocles explains differences in living matter using the same
<br>
argument; muscle is formed by a different combination of elements
<br>
than, say, bone or fat. His preoccupation with ratio illustrates the
<br>
strong influence of Pythagorean philosophers.
<br>
(from this Empedocles literature page:
<br>
<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Students/Jesse/Jesse.html">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Students/Jesse/Jesse.html</a>)
<br>
<p><p>I suppose the line of thinking that first led me to this was
<br>
Aristotle's teleology, and then I kept noticing these four elements
<br>
having a large role in a number of religious, holistic, occultic and
<br>
new-age practices today.
<br>
<p>Here are some of the places I've seen the Four Elements.
<br>
<p>ASTROLOGY
<br>
The signs of the 12 signs of the zodiac are broken down into the
<br>
elements of Fire, Earth, Air, and Water.
<br>
<p>OCCULTISTS/TAROT
<br>
&quot;I am that I am&quot; --&gt; IHVH in Hebrew
<br>
Pentacles/Disks; element Earth and last 'H' in IHVH
<br>
Cups: element Water and first 'H' in IHVH
<br>
Swords: element Air and letter V of IHVH
<br>
Rods/Wands: element Fire and letter I of IHVH
<br>
<p>The Kabbalah-ists' perspective, in addition, is that the Universal
<br>
Tree of Life, the numbered cards, can be divided into into themes
<br>
of the above  ('Four Worlds' ... Plato?) which corresponds to the
<br>
'analysis of man':
<br>
1-&gt; Fire
<br>
2,3 -&gt; Water
<br>
4-9 -&gt; Air
<br>
10 -&gt; Earth
<br>
Court cards too:
<br>
Knight of Wands   -&gt; Fire of Fire
<br>
Queen of Wands    -&gt; Water of Fire
<br>
Prince of Wands   -&gt; Air of Fire
<br>
Princess of Wands -&gt; Earth of Fire
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>WICCANS/PAGANS
<br>
They use the four elements to categorize rituals of every kind, so
<br>
that under each of the elements you can find suitable 'ingredients'
<br>
to use in particular practices. Some of the 'ingredients' (my word,
<br>
not theirs) listed in each of the Four Element are:  Direction,
<br>
Rules, Time, Season, Colors, Tools, Jewel, Incense, Plants, Tree,
<br>
Goddesses, Gods, Spirits., So for example, if your desired ritual
<br>
requires that you do it at a particular time, and you know that you
<br>
want to encourage the &quot;Air&quot; element in your ritual, then you go to
<br>
the table of correspondences, and see &quot;Dawn&quot; as the appropriate
<br>
time. Their list of correspondences is really amazing. I don't know
<br>
where it comes from, but it appears to be very old.
<br>
<p>AYURVEDA
<br>
Ayurveda is an ancient (originating ~5,000 years ago) Indian
<br>
healing/holistic system that has three parts: 1) Healing illness, 2)
<br>
Prevention of disease and 3) Longevity or age reversal. For the
<br>
Ayurvedans (is that a word?), they left out the element &quot;Earth&quot;
<br>
(maybe it was implicitly obvious to them...), and instead, have
<br>
built their holistic practice around the other three. The basic view
<br>
of Ayurveda is that all of life (people, food, animals, nature, the
<br>
universe, and diseases) are combinations of three energy-elements:
<br>
Air (called Vayu or Vata), Fire (called Pitta), and Water (called
<br>
Kapha). When these elements are balanced, one is healthy. Illness is
<br>
defined as an imbalance of these elements; all disorders excesses of
<br>
one or more element. So therefore, this system not only addresses
<br>
physical health, it also addresses aspects of daily life: family,
<br>
work, community, etc., and incorporates the three elements that way.
<br>
<p><p>Categorization
<br>
<p>In Geroge Lakoff's book: _Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things:
<br>
What Categories Reveal About the Mind_,
<br>
he states that bodily experience adds to the basic-level of
<br>
categorization:
<br>
<p>\begin{quote} (pg. 302)
<br>
&quot;The existence of directly meaningful concepts -- basic-level
<br>
concepts and image schemas -- provides certain fixed points in the
<br>
objective evaluation of situations. The image-schematic structure of
<br>
bodily experience is, we hypothesize, the same for all human beings.
<br>
[...] The consideration of certain gross patterns in our experience
<br>
-- our vertical orientation, the nature of our bodies as containers,
<br>
our ability to sense hot and cold, our experience of being empty as
<br>
opposed to filled, etc. suggests that our experiences is structured
<br>
kinesthetically in at least a gross way in a variety of experiential
<br>
domains.
<br>
<p>Cognitive models derive their fundamental meaningfulness directly
<br>
from their ability to match up with preconceptual structure. Such
<br>
direct matchings provide a basis for an account of truth and
<br>
knowledge. Because such matching is &quot;internal&quot; to a person, the
<br>
irreconcilable problems in the objectivist theories do not arise in
<br>
experientialist theories.
<br>
<p>In domains where there is no clearly discernible preconceptual
<br>
structure to our experience, we import such structure via metaphor.
<br>
Metaphor provides us with a means for comprehending domains of
<br>
experience that do not not have a preconceptual structure of their
<br>
own. A great many of our domains of experience are like this.
<br>
Comprehending experience via metaphor is one of the great
<br>
imaginative triumphs of the human mind. Much of rational thought
<br>
involves the use of mataphoric models. Any adequate account of
<br>
rationality must account for the use of imagination and much of
<br>
imaginations consists of metaphorical reasoning.&quot;
<br>
\end{quote}
<br>
<p>And a couple of related quotes regarding Metaphor:
<br>
<p>&quot;Understanding a thing is to arrive at a metaphor for that thing by
<br>
substituting something more familiar to use. We say we understand an
<br>
aspect of nature when we can say it is similar to some familiar
<br>
theoretical model.&quot;
<br>
(Julian Jaynes in _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of
<br>
the Bicameral Mind_, pg. 52, 53)
<br>
<p>&quot;Scientific knowledge, like religious knowledge, is a set of
<br>
metaphors for a reality that can never be completely described or
<br>
comprehended. Religion becomes dogmatic when it confuses the
<br>
metaphor with the thing itself. Metaphors themselves are not
<br>
contradictory or antithetical; many can be true at once. They point
<br>
to something behond themselves; they are separate lights beaming at
<br>
the sam spot. (Starhawk in _The Spiral Dance_, pg. 219)
<br>
<p>With regards to two of the above spiritual &quot;systems&quot; I noticed that
<br>
the oldest (many thousands of years) systems: Wicca and Ayurveda,
<br>
have no Jesus, no Moses, no Buddha... no *Leader*, in other words.
<br>
And the religious practices in these systems focus on the individual
<br>
being 'complete' by building from the 'inside', and not depending on
<br>
outside agents.
<br>
<p>Here is a quote I saw from the Wiccans regarding 'the within'
<br>
<p>&quot;Each of us embodies the divine. Our ultimate spiritual authority is
<br>
within, and we need no other person to interpret the sacred to us.
<br>
We foster the questioning attitude, and we honor intellectual,
<br>
spiritual and creative freedom.&quot;
<br>
(Starhawk in _The Spiral Dance_, pg. 6)
<br>
<p><p><p>This note is a bit of a ramble with some interconnected ideas that I
<br>
found interesting. Have a good Sunday.
