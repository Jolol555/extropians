<p><p>While I understand this is true of many European countries (not through 
<br>
personal experience -- I've been told by many, many of my European 
<br>
co-workers that some rigid social/economic legacy glass ceilings exist 
<br>
there), it would be completely inconsistent with my experience in the 
<br>
U.S.  Fortunes here seem to be made and lost overnight, which isn't 
<br>
conducive to a rigid class structure because hereditary class seems to have 
<br>
little staying power for the most part -- the handful of exceptions are 
<br>
well-known.
<br>
<p>In my relatively short lifetime, most of the people I know have moved from 
<br>
technical poverty into the middle-class or better.  The vast majority of 
<br>
poor people I've known were also young; experience seems to fix poverty 
<br>
most of the time.  Of the people I know that started out wealthy, probably 
<br>
half of them dropped back into the middle class (or worse).  Mind you, back 
<br>
when I was very young and poor and my income was about half the income 
<br>
required to cross the &quot;poverty&quot; line, I didn't starve or even live 
<br>
particularly badly; I just had to be frugal.  Most young people can survive 
<br>
on far less than the poverty line.  The proverbial &quot;family of four&quot; living 
<br>
below the poverty line is very much the exception rather than the rule in 
<br>
my experience (though I grew up in one and it was a family of seven).
<br>
<p>As a rule, if one can get into the middle class, there is nothing keeping 
<br>
one from entering into the upper class, assuming one has the drive to do so 
<br>
and doesn't squander their resources.  In fact, I would claim that it takes 
<br>
substantially more effort to move from the poor classes to the middle class 
<br>
than to move from the middle class to the upper class; the barriers to 
<br>
entry require more determination on the part of the individual, yet people 
<br>
do it all the time.  However most people are quite content to be in the 
<br>
middle class and don't bother investing the relatively small effort 
<br>
required to go any further in my experience.
