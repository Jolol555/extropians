<em>&gt;  &gt; 1. Wasn't the Gulf War about property rights?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It was about enforcement of a UN Resolution brought by the Security
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Council against a UN member and treaty signatory which had violated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an international treaty which it had signed. (Said violation consisted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of waging aggressive war against it's neighbour state.)
</em><br>
<p>... a war waged to ... you can say it... take their land and the oil 
<br>
in their land!  That's called property!  Treaty shmeaty, the problem 
<br>
was with the aggressive theft of property.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;At least, that's the official fiction. To the extent that the Gulf
</em><br>
<em>&gt;War was about property rights it was *not* about British property rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other than in the very tenuous sense of protecting investments of British
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporations overseas.
</em><br>
<p>Worse, the British killed a bunch of Iraqis to protect someone 
<br>
*else's* property.  Seems that the British are rather nosy and 
<br>
deadly, when it comes to property protection.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Cynically, the war was fought to keep the price of gas down at pumps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the US heartland in the run-up to an election.
</em><br>
<p>Great, so Britain fought the US's war for cheap gasoline.  As usual, 
<br>
it's all the nasty US's fault.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; 2. Weren't the British active participants in the Gulf War - using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  lethal force to protect those property rights?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The British were active participants but their official reason for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being there was nothing to do with property rights. Period.
</em><br>
<p>HA!  The &quot;official reason&quot; is irrelevant.  The entire thing was about 
<br>
property rights: Kuwaiti land rights, Kuwaiti oil rights, and the 
<br>
world's access to those oil rights.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; 3. Why is it okay to wipe out thousands of soldiers and more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  few innocents to protect property rights on a country scale, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  not okay to protect property with lethal force on an individual scale?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's not okay to do *either*. Period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please do not mistake me for the British government.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  You said that defending property with lethal force was a 
<br>
&quot;cultural marker&quot; - something that distinguished US culture from 
<br>
British culture.  My point is that your culture does things contrary 
<br>
to your expressed philosophy.  One of us doesn't seem to understand 
<br>
British culture very well.
<br>
