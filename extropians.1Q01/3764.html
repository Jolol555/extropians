<p>Personal Health: Weight Loss Is Possible
<br>
<p>By Jane E. Brody
<br>
<p>Professional beliefs about the possibility of long-term weight loss
<br>
by those who have a lot to lose have not changed much since 1958,
<br>
when the renowned obesity specialist Dr.  Albert J. Stunkard of the
<br>
University of Pennsylvania said: &quot;Most obese persons will not stay
<br>
in treatment. Of those who stay in treatment, most will not lose
<br>
weight, and of those who do lose weight, most will regain it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Stunkard may be right about &quot;most obese persons.&quot; But what
<br>
about the uncounted thousands who do manage to lose many pounds,
<br>
sometimes a third or half of their original weight, and also manage
<br>
to keep it off -- not just for a year or two, but for life? Might
<br>
not their success stories be a better example for those struggling
<br>
to lose weight?
<br>
<p>Weight Loss Is Possible
<br>
<p>Anne M. Fletcher, a registered dietitian who has counseled hundreds
<br>
of overweight patients, thought so when she wrote the inspiring and
<br>
informative book &quot;Thin for Life&quot; (Chapters, 1994; in paperback,
<br>
Houghton Mifflin, $13). In it, she distills 10 secrets of success
<br>
from the stories of 160 &quot;masters of weight control,&quot; defined as
<br>
people who have managed to keep off at least 20 pounds for a
<br>
minimum of three years.
<br>
<p>Actually, the average weight loss for her subjects was 63
<br>
pounds. Seventy percent lost 40 pounds or more, more than half lost
<br>
50 pounds, and most have been maintaining their losses for five or
<br>
more years. And they did it without appetite-suppressing drugs, the
<br>
long-term safety of which is now very much in question. Yesterday
<br>
the Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers of two of the
<br>
most popular diet drugs -- Redux, the trade name for
<br>
dexfenfluramine, and Pondimin, or fenfluramine, half of the
<br>
fen-phen combination -- to withdraw the drugs because they have
<br>
been linked to heart damage.
<br>
<p>Ms. Fletcher also explodes many of the prevailing myths about
<br>
weight loss, like, &quot;If you've been overweight since childhood, it's
<br>
next to impossible to lose weight and keep it off,&quot; and, &quot;If you've
<br>
dieted and failed many times before, there's little hope of ever
<br>
licking your weight problem.&quot; Close to half of Ms. Fletcher's
<br>
&quot;masters&quot; had been heavy since childhood, and nearly 60 percent had
<br>
tried to lose weight at least five times before they finally
<br>
succeeded.
<br>
<p>Debunking other myths, Ms. Fletcher says her masters do not eat
<br>
like birds or exercise fanatically to maintain their losses. Most
<br>
eat several meals a day, including snacks and an occasional
<br>
high-calorie treat. And while most exercise much more than typical
<br>
Americans, 60 percent of whom do not exercise at all, few overdo
<br>
it. About 70 percent exercise three or more times a week, but only
<br>
16 percent do so daily. Walking, not running, is their leading
<br>
activity.
<br>
<p>Lest you think Ms. Fletcher's subjects are an aberration, the
<br>
National Weight Control Registry, an ongoing study, has just
<br>
published an analysis of 629 women and 155 men who lost an average
<br>
of 66 pounds and have maintained at least a 30-pound loss for five
<br>
or more years.  They reduced their body weight by 29 percent, on
<br>
average, successfully moving to a normal weight
<br>
range. Ms. Fletcher's conclusions are corroborated by that study,
<br>
which was conducted by Dr. Mary L. Klem and her colleagues at the
<br>
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the University of
<br>
Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and published in August
<br>
in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
<br>
<p>Most of the registry's participants had been overweight since
<br>
childhood, nearly half had one overweight parent, and more than a
<br>
quarter had two overweight parents. Their genes may have
<br>
predisposed them to obesity, but their sustained weight losses
<br>
prove that heredity need not confer a lifelong destiny.
<br>
<p>How They Do It
<br>
<p>To lose weight, about 55 percent of the registry study participants
<br>
used a formal program or professional assistance, like Weight
<br>
Watchers, Overeaters Anonymous or sessions with a psychologist or
<br>
registered dietitian. The remaining 45 percent did it on their
<br>
own. Nearly 90 percent modified both their eating and their
<br>
exercise habits, reducing the amount and kind of calories consumed
<br>
and increasing the number of calories expended. Only 10 percent
<br>
used diet alone to shed those unwanted pounds, and only one in five
<br>
used a liquid diet formula. Fewer than 6 percent used medication or
<br>
surgery to lose weight.
<br>
<p>The most popular diet strategy, used by nearly 90 percent of
<br>
participants, was to restrict the intake of certain types or
<br>
amounts of foods. Forty-three percent counted calories, a third
<br>
limited their fat intake, and a quarter counted fat grams. More
<br>
than 44 percent ate the same foods they had been eating but limited
<br>
amounts.
<br>
<p>As for exercise, 92 percent exercised at home, and about a third
<br>
regularly exercised with a group or a friend. The women primarily
<br>
chose walking and aerobic dancing for exercise, while the men
<br>
tended to choose competitive sports and weight-lifting.
<br>
<p>More than three-fourths of the study participants said their
<br>
successful weight loss had been prompted by a particular
<br>
event. Many were motivated by health problems -- like varicose
<br>
veins, low back pain, sleep apnea or fatigue -- or emotional
<br>
factors.
<br>
<p>One woman, for example, said that she had lost weight after her
<br>
lawyer told her that her husband had left her because she was too
<br>
fat. Another said she wanted to look good for her approaching 25th
<br>
anniversary. But many others reported that the trigger, according
<br>
to the research team, was simply &quot;ongoing discontent&quot; and the
<br>
decision to &quot;just do it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ms. Fletcher's subjects also reported that something had prompted
<br>
them, as she put it, &quot;to take the reins.&quot; She added, &quot;They stopped
<br>
looking to others for all the answers and decided to lose weight
<br>
for no one other than themselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>Try, Try Again
<br>
<p>More than 90 percent of the registry study participants had tried
<br>
several times to lose weight before they were successful, shedding,
<br>
on average, a total of 53 to 487 pounds in the course of their
<br>
lives. They said their efforts had worked this time because they
<br>
had greater social or health reasons for losing weight.
<br>
<p>More than 80 percent said they had been more committed to making
<br>
behavioral changes, 81 percent said they had exercised more than in
<br>
past attempts, and 63 percent said they had used a stricter
<br>
diet. They also developed ways to deal with cravings and stress
<br>
that enabled them to stick to their diets.
<br>
<p>The people interviewed by Ms. Fletcher likewise learned from past
<br>
mistakes. They became more realistic about their weight goals,
<br>
staying within a range that they could maintain without having to
<br>
go to painful extremes. They learned to monitor their weight (most
<br>
of the registry study participants weighed themselves more than
<br>
once a week) to keep within a 10-pound range. Most had plans of
<br>
action ready when their weight began to creep up -- stopping
<br>
snacks, increasing exercise or reducing portions until they
<br>
returned to their desired weight.
<br>
<p>The masters at weight control have made gradual but total changes
<br>
in how they eat and exercise and do not think of themselves as on a
<br>
diet.  They have accepted the fact that they cannot go back to
<br>
their old eating habits. As one woman put it, &quot;I'd like to be
<br>
eating hot fudge sundaes or brownies, but for me, the weight is
<br>
more important.&quot;
<br>
<p>Much of their resolve stems from the fact that they find life is
<br>
simply better when they are thinner. At least 85 percent of the
<br>
study participants reported that their lives had improved since
<br>
losing weight.  The benefits included gaining self-confidence,
<br>
getting jobs, becoming more involved in their communities and
<br>
cultivating a fulfilling social life.
