<em>&gt; The article you originally quoted in this thread, for example, had

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have ice-core studies and tree ring studies that claim to show

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have not been able to find the actual scientific studies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine the issue for myself.
</em><br>
<p>Your 'suddenly risen' temperatures are actually less than 1 degree. That
<br>
is not any sort of significant measurement whatsoever. Moreover, these
<br>
measurements are from weather stations that have existed in locations
<br>
that have experienced very high levels of local real estate development
<br>
and expansion of transportation uses that drastically increase the local
<br>
heat levels above those caused by weather. In these studies I see no
<br>
accounting whatsoever of the city heat effect on temperature
<br>
measurements.
<br>
<p>here is some evidence of other causes, from an anti-creationist site, no
<br>
less:

<em>&gt; Probably the best arguments for the magnitude of ice age time is the record from long cores taken through the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica. Gish's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outrageous statement (1992) that an armored dinosaur had been found in the ice of Antarctica might be taken as a Mesozoic age for the ice, but in reality the fossil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was found in Mesozoic rocks of the Santa Marta formation (Weishampel, 1990). In the Antarctic ice, summer and winter bands can be counted back, year by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year, to at least 30,000 years (Anderson and Borns, 1994) with overall core lengths indicating total time spans of several hundred thousand years. Dates from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counting the annual layers in the cores can in turn be correlated with C14 dates from the CO2 contained in entrapped air bubbles, with C14 dates from tree ring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlations which can be counted and correlated back 12,000 years, with annual sediment layers from glacial lakes, with dates from the pollen records of climatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change in Europe and America, and with radiometric dates and rate of sedimentation dates on deep sea cores. Most of these dates can in turn be stitched together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and mutually supported by paleomagnetic dates from other areas and dating techniques (summaries by Anderson and Borns, 1994). As new evidence is gained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dating techniques are refined, all these lines of converging evidence show increasing good correlations with the Malenkovich cycles, based on Newtonian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; celestial mechanics, an additional set of time determinations linked to modern astronomic measurements. To argue in the face of such massive and interlocking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that the entire span of the Ice Ages constituted only the last few thousand years must represent a supreme example of faith overcoming reason.
</em><br>
<p>The fact is that over the last 3.2 million years, things have cooled
<br>
down 10 degrees. Any 'global warming' we instigate or that is caused by
<br>
the normal celestial mechanics (which actually fit climate change far
<br>
better than CO2 levels) of the earth is nowhere near the high
<br>
temperature levels that existed 3.2 million years ago, so any effects of
<br>
global warming will not be 'catastrophic'. Antarctica will not collapse,
<br>
despite the continuing claims of those greens who only listen to studies
<br>
that favor their prejudices. The fact that the media has chosen to bury
<br>
and ignore the results of my cousin's own work proving the long term
<br>
stability of the Antarctic Ice Cap indicates to me that there are
<br>
agendas at work here.
