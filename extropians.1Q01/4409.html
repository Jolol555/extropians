<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;From a strictly practical standpoint, I don't think their stance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if any, will be significant because they don't comprise a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant portion of the &quot;tech pool&quot; and lack the influence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; affect development and applications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will that situation last? 
</em><br>
<p>**Of course--so long as the wretched poverty and consequent refuge in 
<br>
religion last. Here's your basic problem: The leaders do in fact 
<br>
realize that technology is a threat to them. They look to the West 
<br>
and they see that people who enjoy the benefits of science and 
<br>
technology pay little heed to religious leaders--who have actually 
<br>
become so completely powerless that banning a book causes the sales 
<br>
to skyrocket. Said leaders put two and two together--science and tech 
<br>
enhance the powers of the individual and make religious leaders 
<br>
irrelevant--and go the other way, becoming rabid antitech nutballs. 
<br>
Of course, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here and assuming 
<br>
they possess the ability to reason (and to add two and two).
<br>
<p>**Either way--tech is death to them, and it ain't in their Book, so 
<br>
the religious leaders will never embrace it--and they are currently 
<br>
creating the environment in which the young are raised, so the cycle 
<br>
continues.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Also, being technologically leading is
<br>
<em>&gt; not the only way of being influential in world politics and culture...
</em><br>
<p>**No; but it's the best way.
<br>
<p>;
<br>
<em>&gt; oil, 
</em><br>
<p>**Push comes to shove, we'll take it because of our tech lead.
<br>
<p>being 25% of the population and having a growing cultural
<br>
<em>&gt; identity can definitely be significant.
</em><br>
<p>**Without sufficient intelligence/savvy/influence/armaments, you 
<br>
could be 99.999% of the population and it really wouldn't matter. 
<br>
Example: China and India declare war on the US. Who wins? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If 25% of the customers want
<br>
<em>&gt; something, there will be a big market of developing it.
</em><br>
<p>**Only if they can pay for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Violent opposition, on the other hand, could have significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why? Islam is not more likely to be dangerously violent than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity,
</em><br>
<p>**You're joking, right?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;and beside some fundie-bashing on this list I don't
<br>
<em>&gt; think many of us consider the Church to be a major factor in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influencing the future of humanity?
</em><br>
<p>**Precisely--and so it will (hopefully) be with the folks you're 
<br>
discussing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's keep to the subject: how does Islamic religion and culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpret and deal with transhumanist issues? 
</em><br>
<p>**I suspect they are, largely, not even aware of them. The issues are 
<br>
completely irrelevant to their lifestyle. I'm talking those in their 
<br>
homelands, of course.
<br>
<p>...This could actually turn out to be one of the major
<br>
<em>&gt; stumbling blocks for spreading transhumanist ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>**I'll have a few thoughts on major stumbling blocks to post later.
<br>
