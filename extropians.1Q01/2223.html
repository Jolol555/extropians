<p>SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The earth's atmosphere is warming faster than 
<br>
expected, evidence is mounting that humans are to blame and tens of 
<br>
millions of people may be forced from low-lying areas as seas rise, the 
<br>
U.N. said on Monday.
<br>
&quot;We see changes in climate, we believe we humans are involved and we're 
<br>
projecting future climate changes much more significant over the next 100 
<br>
years than the last 100 years,&quot; said Robert Watson of the U.N.'s 
<br>
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
<br>
A warmer climate would raise sea levels as ice caps recede and could force 
<br>
tens of millions of people to flee low lying areas like China's Pearl River 
<br>
Delta, Bangladesh and Egypt, the IPCC chairman told a news conference in 
<br>
Shanghai.
<br>
Klaus Toepfer, the head of the United Nations Environment Program which 
<br>
part sponsors the IPCC, said the report should ring alarm bells everywhere.
<br>
&quot;The scientific consensus presented in this comprehensive report about 
<br>
human-induced climate change should sound alarm bells in every national 
<br>
capital and in every local community,&quot; he said in a statement.
<br>
&quot;We must move ahead boldly with clean energy technologies and we should 
<br>
start preparing ourselves for the rising sea levels, changing rain patterns 
<br>
and other impacts of global warming.&quot;
<br>
COMPREHENSIVE REPORT
<br>
Global warming is a highly controversial subject with many respected 
<br>
scientists arguing that the earth undergoes periodic climatic changes with 
<br>
or without contributions from humanity.
<br>
The IPCC report, which runs to more than 1,000 pages, was written by 123 
<br>
lead authors around the world who drew on 516 contributing experts and is 
<br>
one of the most comprehensive produced on global warming.
<br>
A draft summary for policy makers, issued on Monday, said the report 
<br>
projects the earth's average surface temperature will rise 1.4 to 5.8 
<br>
degrees Celsius (2.5 to 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit) between 1990 and 2100, 
<br>
higher than its 1995 estimate of a one to 3.5 degree C rise (1.8 to 6.3 
<br>
degrees F).
<br>
Sea levels were likely to rise between nine and 88 cm (3.54 and 34.64 
<br>
inches) over the same period, it said.
<br>
&quot;The decade of the 1990s was the hottest decade of the last century and the 
<br>
warming in this century is warmer than anything in the last 1,000 years in 
<br>
the Northern Hemisphere,&quot; Watson said.
<br>
&quot;We will see a drier summer in arid and semi-arid areas which will make 
<br>
water management much more difficult in the future,&quot; he said. Ecosystems 
<br>
such as coral and forests will suffer.
<br>
The earth's temperature had already risen 0.6 degrees C (1.08 degrees F) 
<br>
over the last 100 years and it has seen more floods and droughts around the 
<br>
world in the last decade. Land areas had warmed close to one degree, more 
<br>
than oceans, the IPCC said.
<br>
DISEASE, LESS WATER
<br>
Watson said the main reason behind expectations of faster global warming is 
<br>
an anticipated fall in cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur 
<br>
emissions are expected to ease due to concerns they cause acid rain and 
<br>
deposits, he said.
<br>
Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide prevent heat from leaving the 
<br>
earth, therefore warming the earth's atmosphere, whereas sulfur dioxide 
<br>
tends to cool it.
<br>
Watson said the implications of global warming on human health included 
<br>
increases in heat stress mortality in the summer and diseases such as 
<br>
malaria and dengue fever.
<br>
It could also hit agriculture and water resources, which many experts 
<br>
believe will be a major issue in coming years.
<br>
Watson said industrialized nations had to help curb global warming, but 
<br>
developing countries must become more energy efficient and getting the 
<br>
right technologies in place everywhere was critical.
<br>
&quot;Governments can play a critical role in placing the right enabling 
<br>
framework to facilitate the transfers of technology,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not 
<br>
just hardware, it's information and knowledge.&quot;
