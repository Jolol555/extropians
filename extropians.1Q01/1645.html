In &quot;Mother of Storms&quot; by John Barnes a superstorm is postulated. 
<br>
Methane....that arch green house gas....is the villian.
<br>
<p>I quote:
<br>
<p><p>&quot;One strange fact about ice, when you think about it, is that it floats.  
<br>
Solid butter sinks to the bottom of liquid butter, solid iron sinks to the 
<br>
bottom of liquid iron, solid nitrogen sinks to the bottom of liquid 
<br>
nitrogen...but solid water floats on liquid water.
<br>
<p>Imagine a microscope fine enough to show you why.  The water molecule is bent 
<br>
at an agle and try as you like, it doesn't pack neatly.  Freeze water, so 
<br>
that the molecules start to lline up into crystals, and that sloppy packing 
<br>
leaves a lot of empty space,--more empty space than when they are just 
<br>
rolling around on each other.
<br>
<p>Freeze water another way, and there's so much extra space you can trap other 
<br>
molecules between the water molecules.  That's called a clathrate--Latin for 
<br>
a &quot;cage, trellis, or grating&quot;---and all kinds of things can be held in there.
<br>
<p>As when twenty-three water molecules make a cage around four methane 
<br>
molecules.
<br>
<p>There is lots of methane in the seabed.  Everything that sinks down there 
<br>
rots and there's not much free oxygen. Many anaerobic decay processes release 
<br>
methane.  Dead stuff has been rotting on the seabed for a long time--and 
<br>
since the last few ice ages, it's been cold enough down there to trap methane 
<br>
in the clathrates.  On the Artic Ocean floor  many clathrate beds are tens of 
<br>
meters thick and hundreds of kilometers across&quot;
<br>
<p>End of quote.
<br>
<p>Presumeably methane clathrate doesn't float.
<br>
<p>I dunno if the above is true or not...(I have no internet connection any 
<br>
longer....just email...so I can't check it out)  .it certainly sounds 
<br>
feasible to me.
<br>
<p>If it IS correct...and if a huge amount of methane is suddenly released into 
<br>
the atmosphere.....then presumeably there would  REALLY be some global 
<br>
warming.
<br>
<p>And  oceanic warming .
<br>
<p>If the oceans get warmer the Hurricane spawning grounds get larger.  If the 
<br>
spawning grounds get larger the Hurricanes get larger.  Possibly a LOT larger.
<br>
<p>If there is ENOUGH methane released into the atmosphere.....and the ocean 
<br>
water temp gets to ......say........a hundred degrees F. or more  over a huge 
<br>
area.........bad things could happen.
<br>
<p>Is a hurricane with a supersonic eye wall possible?
<br>
<p>IF it's possible what might it's effects be.
<br>
<p>HUGE waves I would imagine.....HUGE storm surges.....
<br>
<p>Globally.  Any location even near a sea coast would be scoured.  
<br>
<p>John Barnes goes into such a scenario in his book which is set in the not so 
<br>
distant future.(circa 2030).......It's very interesting...I highly recommend 
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>However.
<br>
<p>I'm wondering what might have happened had there been,  say, an asteroid or 
<br>
small comet strike, which caused the clathate beds to release  gigantic 
<br>
quantities of methane into earth's atmosphere in pre-historic or very early 
<br>
historic times.
<br>
<p>Suppose this is a recurring theme? Suppose it has happened every few hundred 
<br>
millenia or so.   Would such a superstorm be sufficient to cause massive 
<br>
extinctions?  Surely it would be enough to destroy primitive civilizations.
