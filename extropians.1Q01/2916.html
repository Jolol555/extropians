Addendum: It's fine to devote your time--even your life--to this 
<br>
stuff, and in fact if and when the breakthrough comes that's all to 
<br>
the better (the plans will have been laid in advance, assuming 
<br>
they're applicable). Just so long as you realize, it's likely never 
<br>
gonna happen, and even more likely not in your lifetime.
