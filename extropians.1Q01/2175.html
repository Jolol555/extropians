<em>&gt; &quot;The astronomer Fred Hoyle once remarked to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was pointless for the world to hold more people than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could get to know in a single lifetime.  Even if one were president
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of United Earth, that would set the figure somewhere between ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand and one hundred thousand; with a very generous allowance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for duplication, wastage, special talents, and so forth, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really seems no requirement for what has been called the global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; village of the future to hold more than a million people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scattered over the face of the planet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This reminds me of a line from near the end of the short story &quot;The Gentle 
<br>
Seduction&quot; (from a collection of the same name by Stiegler (sp?)). I don't 
<br>
have the book handy at the moment but to paraphrase it said something 
<br>
like:
<br>
<p>&quot;The population of the solar system had eventually stabalized at around a 
<br>
trillion people. This was enough to provide some room for diversity, while 
<br>
being few enough that you could still get to know everyone personally.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet another place where posthuman capabilities change the balance.
