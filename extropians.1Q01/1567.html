</em><br>
<p>It's not usually a problem in _certain_ circles.  The problem here is,
<br>
perhaps, as Damien stated.  The thread started off soiled with creationism.
<br>
Of course, I should've known any discussion over it here would go in that
<br>
direction, since most people here only understand the issue in terms of
<br>
&quot;creationism vs. evolution.&quot;  (Not that this is all that bad.  We can't all
<br>
be evolutionary biologists.:)
<br>
<p>Also, I don't consider offering explanations such as genetic drift or
<br>
orthogenesis for the evolution of some particular biological thing (whether
<br>
species, behavior, body part (e.g., eye), digestive process) as &quot;attacking
<br>
evolution.&quot;  It might be attacking a particular explanation of evolution,
<br>
but none of the aforementioned explanations go against evolution as such.
<br>
<p>Also, someone mentioned in an earlier thread that Darwin claimed that the
<br>
eye could've evolved in so many generations.  It's been a long time since
<br>
I've read Darwin.  Now, I don't mean to diss him either, as he is one of the
<br>
best exemplars of the scientific and dialectical methods.  He not only
<br>
demonstrates his views, but considers alternatives in detail.
<br>
<p>However, this solution to the problem of the eye's evolution is just
<br>
speculation.  What we need is evidence.  now, I don't doubt the eye came
<br>
about by an evolutionary process, BUT which one and how?  To find out, we
<br>
need to test various hypotheses -- not just assume them.  This is why I
<br>
wrote &quot;Testing Evolutionary Explanations&quot; (at
<br>
<a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Testing.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Testing.html</a>).  While such speculations
<br>
might be a good way to get at the truth of the matter, they must be tested.
<br>
They are also weak arguments and not the final word.
<br>
<p>One can't, after all, just offer a story that fits with one's pet theory
<br>
and, say, &quot;Voila!  I've solved all problems and answered all criticisms!&quot;
<br>
(I'm NOT claiming Darwin did this, but I AM claiming others do this.)  This
<br>
is no different than any other mythology.  In order not to be myth, science
<br>
must rely on rigorous testing...
<br>
<p>Vivamus!
