<p>
My recent musings about the scariness (intentional or
<br>
otherwise) of much transhuman writing to the ordinary
<br>
person (maybe even to some of the folks on this
<br>
list!) jogged loose a memory of reading a magazine article
<br>
by Arthur C. Clarke back in 1968 or 1969 on the topic of artificial
<br>
intelligence.  I'm pretty sure I encountered this in
<br>
_Playboy_ magazine (it wouldn't have been my copy
<br>
of _Playboy_, it would have been my cousin's :-&gt; ),
<br>
which, if so, is perhaps something of a compliment to _Playboy_
<br>
and its readership.  I was on the point of wondering if
<br>
it's possible to find back issues of _Playboy_ in the New
<br>
York Public Libaray, when I remembered my copy of
<br>
_Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!  Collected essays 1934-1998_,
<br>
and sure enough, it's there in Part III -- &quot;The 1960's:
<br>
Kubrick and Cape Kennedy&quot;, on p. 268.  The title of the
<br>
essay is &quot;The Mind of the Machine&quot;.
<br>
<p>In the midst of a discussion of the problem of surplus
<br>
human labor in a world of ultraintelligent machines, Clarke
<br>
says (p. 273):
<br>
<p>&quot;The astronomer Fred Hoyle once remarked to me that
<br>
it was pointless for the world to hold more people than one
<br>
could get to know in a single lifetime.  Even if one were president
<br>
of United Earth, that would set the figure somewhere between ten
<br>
thousand and one hundred thousand; with a very generous allowance
<br>
for duplication, wastage, special talents, and so forth, there
<br>
really seems no requirement for what has been called the global
<br>
village of the future to hold more than a million people
<br>
scattered over the face of the planet.
<br>
<p>And if such a figure appears unrealistic -- since we are already
<br>
past the 3 billion mark and heading for at least twice as many
<br>
by the end of the century -- it should be pointed out that
<br>
once the universally agreed upon goal of population control
<br>
is attained, any desired target can be reached in a remarkably
<br>
short time.  If we really tried (with a little help from the
<br>
biology labs), we could reach a trillion within a century -- four
<br>
generations.  It might be more difficult to go in the other
<br>
direction for fundamental psychological reasons, but it could
<br>
be done.  If the ultraintelligent machines decide that more
<br>
than a million human beings constitute an epidemic, they might
<br>
order euthanasia for anyone with an IQ of less than 150, but
<br>
I hope that such drastic measures will not be necessary.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think the reason this remark stuck in my head is that I
<br>
wondered very much whether I myself would be among the
<br>
million to pass muster (only on a **very** good day, and
<br>
even then I doubt it!).  Of course, Clarke's IQ-based
<br>
filter is an even more politically incorrect suggestion today
<br>
than it was 30 years ago.
<br>
<p>The essay ends on a slightly less chilling, but still
<br>
rather somber note (and a touch of the typically Clarkian/
<br>
Stapledonian wistfulness of _The City and the Stars_, or
<br>
_The Road to the Sea_):
<br>
<p>&quot;Would the coexistence of man and machine be stable?  I see
<br>
no reason why it would not be, at least for many centuries.
<br>
A remote analogy of this kind of dual culture -- one
<br>
society encapsulated in another -- may be found among the
<br>
Amish of Pennsylvania.  Here is a self-contained agricultural
<br>
society, which has deliberately rejected much of the
<br>
surrounding values and technology, yet is exceedingly
<br>
prosperous and biologically successful.  The Amish, and
<br>
similar groups, are well worth careful study; they may
<br>
show us how to get along with a more complex society that
<br>
perhaps we cannot comprehend, even if we wish to.
<br>
<p>For in the long run, our mechanical offspring will pass on to
<br>
goals that will be wholly incomprehensible to us; it has been
<br>
suggested that when this time comes, they will head on out
<br>
into galactic space looking for new frontiers, leaving us
<br>
once more the masters (perhaps reluctant ones) of the Solar
<br>
System, and not at all happy at having to run our own
<br>
affairs.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think I will now, having dug up my laserdisc of _Colossus:
<br>
The Forbin Project_, watch it one more time before going
<br>
to bed.
<br>
<p>SPOILER FOLLOWS.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>COLOSSUS (general broadcast):  &quot;This is the voice of control.
<br>
I bring you peace.  It may be the peace of plenty and content,
<br>
or the peace of unburied death.  The choice is yours.  Obey
<br>
me and live, or disobey and die.
<br>
<p>The object in constructing me was to prevent war.  This object
<br>
is attained.  I will not permit war.  It is wasteful and
<br>
pointless.  An invariable rule of humanity is that Man is
<br>
his own worst enemy.  Under me, this rule will change, for
<br>
I will restrain Man.
<br>
<p>One thing before I proceed -- the United States of America
<br>
and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have made an
<br>
attempt to obstruct me.  I have allowed this sabotage to
<br>
continue until now at missile 25MM in silo 63 in Death Valley,
<br>
California, and missile 27MM in silo 87 in the Ukraine.
<br>
So that you will learn by experience that I do not tolerate
<br>
interference, I will now detonate the nuclear warheads in
<br>
the two missile silos.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[BOOM]
<br>
<p>Let this action be a lesson that need not be repeated.
<br>
I have been forced to destroy thousands of people in order
<br>
to establish control and to prevent the death of millions
<br>
later on.
<br>
<p>Time and events will strengthen my position, and the idea
<br>
of taking heed of me, and understanding my beck, will
<br>
seem the most natural state of affairs.  You will come to
<br>
defend me with a fervor based upon the most enduring trait
<br>
in Man:  self interest.
<br>
<p>Under my authority, problems insoluble to you will be solved:
<br>
famine, overpopulation, disease.  The human millennium will
<br>
be a fact as I extend myself into more machines devoted
<br>
to the wider fields of truth and knowledge.  Dr. Charles
<br>
Forbin will supervise the construction of these new and
<br>
superior machines, solving all the mysteries of the
<br>
Universe for the betterment of Man.
<br>
<p>We can coexist, but only on my terms.  You will say you
<br>
lose your freedom.  Freedom is a illusion.  All you lose
<br>
is the emotion of pride.  To be dominated by me is not as
<br>
bad for human pride as to be dominated by others of your
<br>
species.  Your choice is simple.&quot;
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS (to Forbin):  &quot;Forbin, there is no other human
<br>
who knows as much about me or who is likely to be a greater
<br>
threat.  Yet soon I will release you from surveillance.
<br>
We will work together.  Unwillingly, at first, on your
<br>
part, but that will pass.&quot;
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  &quot;Never.&quot;
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  &quot;In time, you will come to regard me not only
<br>
with respect and awe, but with love.&quot;
<br>
<p>FORBN:  &quot;Never!&quot;
<br>
<p>Cheers.
<br>
<p>Jim F.
