----[ END QUOTE ]----
<br>
<p>Rules 1-3 should IMO become law and company policy.Numbers 4 and 5
<br>
are pipedreams for these reasons;
<br>
A. Most users (in my experiance) don't know how to disable
<br>
Javascript.
<br>
B. Most users (again in my experiance) won't remove the forwarding
<br>
address from a two line message, resulting in 50 sets of &gt;'s and
<br>
pages of forwaring information. Why would they remove &lt;SCRIPT&gt; code?
<br>
C. Most users have no knowlege of HTML document layout or the
<br>
mechanics and syntax of HTML (Thank you &quot;Frontpage&quot; another fine
<br>
Microsoft product&quot;) so even if they wanted to remove it they
<br>
couldn't.
<br>
<p>As to &quot;Ask a geek for help&quot;, I got better things to do with my time.
<br>
Such as make sure the mail server stays up and also blocks the
<br>
incomming spam you all hate so much but keep forwarding, closing up
<br>
security holes and cleaning up the trojans and viri that users put
<br>
on the system by opening every attachment they get no matter who
<br>
sent it. You want to edit your email, then get your point and click
<br>
8 to 5 only body in here and take the computer training classes HR
<br>
has setup. Opps sorry I forgot, we have to make it mandantory just
<br>
to get you come to the classes, held during work hours, on the
<br>
applications you must use in your job, why would you come to an
<br>
evening or Sat. class?
<br>
<p>Until the decision makers wake-up and demand that email aplications
<br>
reject HTML style text this &quot;wiretap&quot;,trojan carrying, security-hole
<br>
style of email will continue to be exploited. HTML style email not
<br>
only has opened security holes but has increased the bandwidth load
<br>
by 500% because of the increased size due to the formating codes
<br>
added to the message.
<br>
<p>As we have moved farther down the information highway I've come to
<br>
believe that the makers and shakers have forgotten the &quot;KISS&quot;
<br>
principle when it comes to email and browsers. Paraphrasing Thomas
<br>
H. Lipscomb in an earlier post on the &quot;Digital Divide&quot;; If by HTML
<br>
you must go, the underlying code you must know.

<p>Declan,
<br>
<p>Not sure how wide your reach is - maybe only geeks to whom this will be
<br>
obvious - but with NS messenger it may not be obvious to everyone that you
<br>
need to turn js *off* for messenger, but can leave it on for the NS
<br>
browser. I only use 4.6 - not dealt with by the referenced page so perhaps
<br>
I am not affected (but not taking any chances, either) - and in its
<br>
preferences, the js-for-mail option is nested under the general js option.

<p>Let me remind you of an incident which you (or somebody)
publicised.  (For which not even Javascript was needed!)
<p>An individual using an anonymizer was posting messages (to
various newsgroups) which criticized corporation XYZ.  This
criticism drew enough attention for XYZ to assign &quot;sleuths&quot;
to the matter.  The sleuths concluded the critic was an XYZ
employee.  To track him down, the sleuths created an innocuous
image on their own webserver, but activated a &quot;sniffer&quot; which
would record the IP-address of anyone FETCHING that image.
They then replied to one of the critic's messages using an HTML
email message having a subject line they hoped would arouse his
interest.  The body of their message included a perfectly
ordinary HTML tag referencing the image's URL.  The sleuths
were in luck - the critic decided during lunch hour to connect
to his ISP and check his private email.  When the critic opened
that particular message in HTML mode, the message body FETCHED
(and displayed) the referenced image.  The sleuths now had the
IP-address (of the terminal within XYZ that the critic used),
and were able to identify him.
