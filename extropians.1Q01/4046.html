<em>&gt; Nonsense again, lets try arguing from definitions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitalism: An economic system in which investment in and ownership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The U.S in spades, note that there is no overide by government crap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialism: A theory or system of social organization in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means of production and distribution of goods are owned and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled collectively, or by the government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't even remotely apply to the U.S.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps our disagreement relates to the meaning of ownership.  I'd say it
<br>
implies that the owner has the right to do as he wishes with his property.
<br>
Nowhere on earth is this possible, to my knowledge.
<br>
<p>Certainly here in the U.S. the government places many constraints on
<br>
businesses and property owners that limit what they can do with &quot;their&quot;
<br>
property.  Granted, they are called owners, but when you look at who has
<br>
the real power, they are more like renters who are granted some limited
<br>
authority by the real owner, the government.  They are even forced to
<br>
pay rent in the form of taxes.
<br>
<p>Examples of government control over private property are so numerous
<br>
that I hardly think it is necessary to list them.  Look at the recent
<br>
power crisis in California, for one.  Would anyone characterize it as
<br>
capitalism in action?
<br>
<p>As I said before, the U.S. is a mixed economy, with elements of capitalism
<br>
in a framework of government regulation.  Many of the original goals
<br>
of the socialists have come into existence in our regulated society.
<br>
Think back to the ideological crossroads we faced in the 1920s and 30s.
<br>
Someone from that time, an era before social security, before welfare,
<br>
before most of the growth of government that has occured this century,
<br>
would likely see us as socialist as much as capitalist.
