<p><em>&gt;My first near-adult ambition was to be an architect and seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Soleri's great big beautiful book about his ideas in the late 60s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or was it the very early 70s?) for the first time was one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;great aesthetic experiences of my life.  However, I've come to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;position of deep skepticism about the basic premise of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arcology since then.
</em><br>
<p>You might be interested in the fact that this book has been re-
<br>
released. I share your appreciation of it's value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The fundamental issue I take with Soleri's conception of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arcology is its reliance on central planning and a priori
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions about over-all urban design.  At one end of a spectrum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of how an arcology might actually be built, we see a desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impose structure on urban life at every level from a city's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inception.  It is possible to imagine a less pre-determined and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more organic implementation, in which the basic structure of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arcology is laid out to provide a mechanical and infrastructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grid and then fine-scale development is allowed to happen on an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emergent basis (but, ironically, this would require even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prior engineering work than a more fully planned arcology). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, in either case, the basic notion of an arcology calls for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a level of up-front planning that seems inconsistent with the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of open-ended evolutionary flexibility that I've come to see as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the most healthy fundamental value for urban life.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think the concept of arcologies has advanced since it's initial
<br>
conception as it was always meant to. You might want to visit the
<br>
arcosanti web site to see some of the new work.
<br>
<p>I like the idea of maintaining flexibility, like Jefferson we can
<br>
always start knocking down walls.
<br>
<p>The interesting part about arcologies to me is the notion of
<br>
applying greater planning than normally goes into urban
<br>
development, and reaping the benefits thereof. Arcologies would be
<br>
neo-biological and therefore subject to evolutionary pressures as
<br>
well as advantages.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Beyond this, the problem of capital concentration seems to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Soleri's most ambitious ideas impractical in any but a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;completely freed from the economics of scarcity by full-blown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Drexlerian nanotech.  Working as I do now in the world of very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large scale engineering and construction, I fear the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social structure required to support the concentration of capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required to undertake a &quot;real&quot; arcology as envisioned by Soleri. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A few hundred million dollars seems to be a practical upper limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the amount of money that can be sunk into development of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engineering project by private interests.  With current and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;near-term technology, this seems to be far short 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of what would be required to finance the building of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infrastructural and civil/structural &quot;core&quot; of a working arcology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of any meaningful size (even a &quot;village&quot; of a hundred thousand or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so, much less a real city . . .)
</em><br>
<p>Chip fabs are in the billions, and even now large companies build
<br>
whole subdivisions. I think it's a matter of someone talking the
<br>
leap.
<br>
<p>There could be a scale to this, It could start by building very
<br>
advanced versions of current apartment buildings. I for one would
<br>
be willing to move to a building that possessed more advanced
<br>
arcology like features.
<br>
<p>But at the same time I see your point, as a former condo owner I've
<br>
seen the rise of, and fought battles with, fascist condo
<br>
associations as well.
