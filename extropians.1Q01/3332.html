I drove a pickup in Louisiana and Mississippi from 1991 to 1997.  I got
<br>
pulled over once in all that time for an illegal U-Turn.  A white guy
<br>
driving a pickup in LA and MS is about as normal as can be.  Of course, I
<br>
didn't have a gun rack - so points off there, and seldom were there beer
<br>
cans in the truck bed...

<em>&gt; quotes: &lt;&lt; &gt;Most all of my black friends (or African
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans if you prefer)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live with being pulled over quite often.  I think it even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where they feel that it's just something you have to deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect it.  One such friend was astonished when I told him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd only ever been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pulled over once.  He get's pulled over quite a lot, as does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his parents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends, etc. And these are all middle to upper class people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  They just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen to have the wrong skin color.  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't wish to divert you from your theme but just to add
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pot.  If you are white and don't believe there is such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing as the cops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picking on &quot;target&quot; groups start driving a pickup truck.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have driven a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pick up at times in my life but an auto much more often yet a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good 80% of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stops have been while in the pick up.  Furthermore the nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the stops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are such that I have never received a payable ticket during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pickup stops.  Either no ticket was issued or it was nonsense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beaten.
