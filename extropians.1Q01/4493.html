<em>&gt; Yes, and applying the PC label to someone you disagree with is basically a

<p>I believe that the original historical term was Politically _Incorrect_
<br>
(emphasis mine)--&quot;having been found to not be suitably conforming to
<br>
Marxist-Leninist(-Maoist) thought/Party line&quot;--and that being found PI
<br>
was a good way to wind up in a reeducation camp or worse. Not sure if
<br>
the expression was originally Russian or Chinese, or both. But it was a
<br>
genuine phrase to strike terror.
<br>
<p>I am under the impression that in the late 60's/early 70's it came to be
<br>
used archly or ironically by &quot;lefties&quot; who didn't really have a grasp of
<br>
what a gulag was like; it was very big in some Lesbian Feminist circles
<br>
with which I had contact. I heard &quot;PI&quot; long before I heard &quot;PC&quot;, usually
<br>
when someone would point out some part of someone's worldview, e.g.
<br>
&quot;&lt;comedian x&gt; is funny, but rather PI, don't you think?&quot;
<br>
<p>These days &quot;PC&quot; seems to have come to mean &quot;conforming to some party
<br>
line&quot;.
<br>
<p>It _is_ getting rather threadbare, and I can't say I much like its
<br>
origins.
