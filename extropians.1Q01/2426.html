Think of it this way: they are optimistic that solutions to the side
<br>
effects of their vices will be found before they die (a very extropic
<br>
point of view), or else new studies will show that what they like to do
<br>
is actually good for them (as the Paleolithic Diet shows). People have
<br>
smoked things for thousands of years. What cigarettes prove is that
<br>
mixing asbestos, fiberglass, and anti-freeze in with your tobacco is a
<br>
bad idea.
<br>
<p>Now, I use Corel for most of my writing, and edit plus for my coding.
<br>
Corel is now 25% owned by M$ (as Apple is now 50% owned by M$).
