Here's a review of a very interesting book by Jonathan Israel.  It seems to 
<br>
be consonant with my own on-going re-evaluation of the Enlightenment, and is 
<br>
going onto the top of my reading list:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.booksonline.co.uk/booksol?ac=004431425455051&rtmo=fsqsqv0s&atmo=rrr">http://www.booksonline.co.uk/booksol?ac=004431425455051&rtmo=fsqsqv0s&atmo=rrr</a>
<br>
<p>rrrrq&amp;pg=/01/2/24/boadam24.html
<br>
<p>EVEN revolutions need their patron saints. Revolutionary France canonised 
<br>
Voltaire and Rousseau as the fathers of &quot;Liberty, Equality and Fraternity&quot;. 
<br>
And to honour their prophetic status, in 1793 - just as the Revolution was 
<br>
winding up to its most frenzied killing-spree, the Terror - their mortal 
<br>
remains were installed in the Pantheon, the new republic's Temple of Heroes, 
<br>
in a ritual of suitably pagan splendour. 
<br>
<p>Since 1793 historians have generally concurred that the two great thinkers 
<br>
had merited their place in the Pantheon. In the Enlightenment, the 
<br>
intellectual movement that did so much to undermine the foundations of the 
<br>
ancien regime, they were obviously giants, exposing the effrontery of the 
<br>
monarch's claim to rule by divine right, denouncing the Church as a peddler 
<br>
of superstition, and elevating nature and human reason over the bogus 
<br>
authority of scripture and tradition. 
<br>
<p>Of course, freedom-loving England produced Enlightened figures of its own - 
<br>
not least Locke, Shaftesbury and Toland - but they were clearly outshone and 
<br>
outsold by the French philosophes. Voltaire in the 1740s and Rousseau in the 
<br>
1760s were both Europe-wide publishing phenomena. 
<br>
<p>Or so it has seemed until now. Enter Jonathan Israel - once described as the 
<br>
thinking person's Simon Schama - one of Britain's most distinguished 
<br>
historians, recently sadly brain-drained to Princeton. His vast - and vastly 
<br>
impressive - book sets out to redefine the intellectual landscape of early 
<br>
modern Europe. Beside this enormous 800-page JCB, earlier toilers in the 
<br>
field seem to have been working with buckets and spades. If he is right, 
<br>
these former historians of the Enlightenment have got the topography of their 
<br>
chosen field quite spectacularly wrong. 
<br>
<p>First, argues Israel, let us reassess Voltaire and Rousseau. Of course, they 
<br>
had a huge influence as synthesisers and popularisers. But by the time they 
<br>
appeared on the scene to reap their success, &quot;the real business was already 
<br>
over&quot;. The truly &quot;revolutionary concepts&quot; had been sown almost a century 
<br>
earlier, and by other hands. 
<br>
<p>So, too, with the question of chronology. The real watershed - the age of 
<br>
truly &quot;Radical Enlightenment&quot; - Israel argues, lay in the last quarter of the 
<br>
17th century. And rather than being either French or English, it was a 
<br>
genuinely pan-European phenomenon. &quot;National&quot; approaches to the Enlightenment 
<br>
simply fail to grasp the inter-connectedness of ideas and influences across 
<br>
the European continent - hence the stupendous scale of this book, which 
<br>
ranges from London to Moscow, Stockholm to Naples, in a virtuoso display of 
<br>
polyglot learning. 
<br>
<p>Until the 1650s, Israel argues, European society - for all its divisions 
<br>
between Roman Catholic and Protestant - had been built on a common 
<br>
theological foundation: the belief in an all-powerful God. He intervened 
<br>
directly in human affairs, and gave his divine sanction to the hereditary 
<br>
monarchies through which most European states were ruled. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the middle of the 17th century, however, this theistic world-view was 
</em><br>
assailed from a variety of quarters: from the scientific revolutions of 
<br>
Galileo and Newton; from advances in mathematics, which seemed to offer a 
<br>
higher and purer standard of &quot;truth&quot; than revealed religion; and, above all, 
<br>
from a new and dangerous group of &quot;atheist&quot; philosophers, who either denied 
<br>
the existence of the deity or so closely identified him with Nature as to 
<br>
make the traditional Christian idea of a personal God seem absurd. 
<br>
<p>And by far the most subversive and influential of these radicals, Israel 
<br>
argues, was Benedict de Spinoza (1632-77), the Amsterdam Jew whom most 
<br>
historians have tended to dismiss hitherto as the Cinderella at the 
<br>
Enlightenment Ball. 
<br>
<p>To Spinoza, the rituals of religion were nothing more than a response to 
<br>
psychological weakness and superstition. The belief that God intervenes in 
<br>
the world to punish wickedness he regarded as self-evidently false, since 
<br>
natural calamities afflict the virtuous and the wicked alike. 
<br>
<p>With the dethroning of God, it was but a short step to the dethroning of 
<br>
temporal kings. Spinozan atheism struck at the very idea of a divinely 
<br>
sanctioned social hierarchy of any kind, still less one with a monarch and an 
<br>
aristocracy at its top. 
<br>
<p>Israel argues that Spinoza and his philosophy sent a seismic shock through 
<br>
the European continent in the last decades of the 17th century. Whether in 
<br>
universities, learned societies, churches or coffee-houses, European 
<br>
intellectual life was divided among warring factions of traditionalists and 
<br>
radicals, with varying shades of moderates - striving to achieve a synthesis 
<br>
between the old and new - caught in the crossfire in between. Treatises and 
<br>
pamphlets poured from the presses - or, if really subversive, in manuscript - 
<br>
all of them to some extent touched by the new ferment of radical ideas. 
<br>
<p>Many of these authors are hardly household names: step forward Geulincx, 
<br>
Bredenburg, Bekker, Burman and Wachter. The attention they receive here is 
<br>
itself a reflection of the powerful originality of a book that sets out to 
<br>
redefine the entire dramatis personae of the Enlightenment, re-assigning 
<br>
major roles, and introducing a far more varied and cosmopolitan cast than has 
<br>
ever previously been allowed to be seen. 
<br>
<p>In so gargantuan an edifice, there is inevitably the occasional crack. How 
<br>
far the Enlightenment radicals were influenced by Spinoza - rather than a 
<br>
series of other possible contenders - is never definitively established. And 
<br>
the case that 18th-century political radicalism was philosophically derived 
<br>
is more often assumed than proved. But these are the merest quibbles beside 
<br>
the scale of Professor Israel's achievement. 
<br>
<p>Magnificent and magisterial, Radical Enlightenment will undoubtedly be one of 
<br>
truly great historical works of the decade.
