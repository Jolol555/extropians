<em>&gt; I like  Descartes &quot;definition&quot; - &quot;Philosophy affords the means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discoursing with an appearance of truth on all matters and commands the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admiration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more simple&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That is a truly remarkable quotation, especially considering the source.
<br>
For the full text from which this is taken see:

DISCOURSE ON THE METHOD OF RIGHTLY CONDUCTING THE REASON,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND SEEKING TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Rene Descartes
<br>
<a href="http://www.eserver.org/philosophy/descartes-discourse.txt">http://www.eserver.org/philosophy/descartes-discourse.txt</a>
<br>
If this Discourse appear too long to be read at once, it may be divided
<br>
into six Parts:  and, in the first, will be found various considerations
<br>
touching the Sciences; in the second, the principal rules of the Method
<br>
which the Author has discovered, in the third, certain of the rules of
<br>
Morals which he has deduced from this Method; in the fourth, the
<br>
reasonings by which he establishes the existence of God and of the Human
<br>
Soul, which are the foundations of his Metaphysic; in the fifth, the order
<br>
of the Physical questions which he has investigated, and, in particular,
<br>
the explication of the motion of the heart and of some other difficulties
<br>
pertaining to Medicine, as also the difference between the soul of man and
<br>
that of the brutes; and, in the last, what the Author believes to be
<br>
required in order to greater advancement in the investigation of Nature
<br>
than has yet been made, with the reasons that have induced him to write.
<br>
-------------------------------------------------
<br>
I still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the schools.
<br>
I was aware that the languages taught in them are necessary to the
<br>
understanding of the writings of the ancients; that the grace of fable
<br>
stirs the mind; that the memorable deeds of history elevate it; and, if
<br>
read with discretion, aid in forming the judgment; that the perusal of all
<br>
excellent books is,  as it were, to interview with the noblest men of past
<br>
ages, who have written them, and even a studied interview, in which are
<br>
discovered to us only their choicest thoughts; that eloquence has
<br>
incomparable force and beauty; that poesy has its ravishing graces and
<br>
delights; that in the mathematics there are many refined discoveries
<br>
eminently suited to gratify the inquisitive, as well as further all the
<br>
arts an lessen the labour of man; that numerous highly useful precepts and
<br>
exhortations to virtue are contained in treatises on morals; that theology
<br>
points out the path to heaven; that philosophy affords the means of
<br>
discoursing with an appearance of truth on all matters, and commands the
<br>
admiration of the more simple; that jurisprudence, medicine, and the other
<br>
sciences, secure for their cultivators honors and riches; and, in fine,
<br>
that it is useful to bestow some attention upon all, even upon those
<br>
abounding the most in superstition and error, that we may be in a position
<br>
to determine their real value, and guard against being deceived.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
