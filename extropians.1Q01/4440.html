</em><br>
<p>I think Shirky's basically correct.  Note though, that Shirky's article deals
<br>
with micropayment schemes where the price is set by the goods provider rather
<br>
than the goods consumer.  Voluntary &quot;tipjar&quot;-like systems (like
<br>
<a href="http://www.fairtunes.com">http://www.fairtunes.com</a>) don't suffer as much from mental transaction
<br>
costs--you need only think about payment when an article strikes you as
<br>
particularly well-written, insightful, or humorous--no anxiety is involved.
<br>
(Guilt, maybe.)  If the transaction costs are low enough (&quot;1-click tipping&quot;,
<br>
hey, maybe I should patent that), I  suspect most people would not have a
<br>
problem occasionally flipping a dime or quarter to their favorite author or
<br>
artist.  The tip then becomes a form of applause.
<br>
<p>How much money could people make in tips?  As (DiCola, 2000) points out, most
<br>
people who make a substantial fraction of their income from tips receive an
<br>
overall low salary, and low social status (bellboys, waitresses).  On the
<br>
national scale, real world tipping gross revenues are quite large--$20
<br>
billion/year, larger than the gross revenues of the entire recording
<br>
industry.  So far, though, little money has changed hands via existing
<br>
systems.  For example, fairtunes has collected in the neighborhood of $6,100
<br>
in tips to date.  I think that will change as these projects become more
<br>
widely known, and as the transaction costs become lower.  (cf. the Espra
<br>
project <a href="http://www.espra.net">http://www.espra.net</a>)   I also think artists must make an effort to
<br>
create a personable online personna to create some of the social pressure
<br>
that drives flesh world tipping.  That means bboards, mailing lists, photos,
<br>
periodic chats, biographies, streaming video, etc.  I think record companies
<br>
will be supplanted by companies that provide these services, as well as
<br>
accounting and order fulfillment services.
<br>
<p>If you can track who's given the most tips to a particular artist, you can
<br>
also offer the fans more incentives to tip.  For example, how much would
<br>
someone pay to be known as the Beatle's number #1 fan?  (As objectively
<br>
measured by the amount of tips they've paid for Beatle's songs.)  Artists
<br>
could offer to have dinner with their top 10 fans every month.  Many people
<br>
like to collect band memorabilia (liner notes, photos, cd's).  Bands could
<br>
offer exclusive collectible premiums, such special edition cd's, that are
<br>
only available to fans who tip at least $100.   Bands could set up affiliate
<br>
programs so that fans who direct a lot of tips the bands way get a percentage
<br>
of the cut.
<br>
<p>Here's how I see things shaping up:
<br>
<p>Unknown artists will primarily subsidize their work, much as they do now.
<br>
Tipping will provide some revenue but not enough to live on.
<br>
<p>As an artist becomes more popular, tipping revenues will increase, and some
<br>
of the secondary sources of income I mention above will become more
<br>
lucrative.  If an artist becomes _really_ popular, I think that pre-payment
<br>
becomes possible--e.g. &quot;I will release my next book/album if I receive
<br>
$50,000 in tips.&quot;  (Stephen King's experiment with &quot;The Plant&quot; although
<br>
designed poorly, and failed on its own terms, still brought in a ton of
<br>
money. )  Shameless plug:  see my essay, The Wall Street Performer Protocol,
<br>
for a way prepayment could be done for software products at
<br>
<a href="http://www.openknowledge.org/writing/open-source/scb/">http://www.openknowledge.org/writing/open-source/scb/</a>.
<br>
<p>Other sources of income--cd sales, live performance, commercial
<br>
endorsements--will likely continue as they have to date.  Some companies may
<br>
also subsidize artists to drive up demand for services they can charge
<br>
for--e.g. connectivity and bandwidth.  (Think AOL/Time Warner.)
<br>
<p>Whatever happens, I think the arts will not be a particularly lucrative field
<br>
for most performers.   The problem is that supply exceeds demand--most
<br>
artists find their work intrinsicly rewarding, so they will continue to
<br>
create art even if they must subsidize it.  I expect that most artist incomes
<br>
will continue to fall along a Zipf distribution--a few superstars will make
<br>
most of the money, while the rest must continue to work at their day jobs.
<br>
Whether the advent of the Internet will increase or decrease median artist
<br>
salaries remains to be seen.
