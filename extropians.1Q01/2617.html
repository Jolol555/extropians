&nbsp;Of course,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it only works if people know or suspect that you've got one. Keeping it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a secret doesn't help much.

</em><br>
I think that was one of the big jokes in the movie Dr. Strangelove!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;There was also a SF cyberpunk novel which had a guy driving around with a nuke
<br>
in his motorcycle side car. The authorties did everything possible to
<br>
protect him. Forgot the name of the story. Perhaps list members might
<br>
remember it?
<br>
<p>Best
