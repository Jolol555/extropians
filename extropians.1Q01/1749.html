<em>&gt; &quot;no need to buy them back&quot;?  Do you realize how much money many people

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and accessories valued in excess of a thousand dollars, this would be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraordinarily vile policy and extremely unpopular. 
</em><br>
<p>With the number of privately owned guns at around 245 million guns in
<br>
the US, at a typical value of, say, $500, thats a confiscation of about
<br>
$100 billion worth of private property. Thats more than the entire value
<br>
of many countries (likely greater than the value of Herr Bider's home
<br>
country of Slovenia). How would you like it if a neighbor, say, Italy,
<br>
had a communist government and decided to confiscate the entire country
<br>
of Slovenia from its allegedly freedom loving citizens because it
<br>
decided that they couldn't be trusted with their freedom as an
<br>
independent nation? That is exactly the scale of the sort of measure Mr.
<br>
Bider is proposing.
<br>
Of course, a government that thinks it can tell a $100+ billion company
<br>
like Microsoft how to run its business is only a hairs breadth from
<br>
doing just that...
