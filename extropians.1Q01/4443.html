<em>&gt; Other than paying lip-service to such high-falutin' concepts as individual

</em><br>
<em>&gt; why a speech by Heston could be important to extropians. As is typical of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right-wing pundits, he is once more engaging in the type of empty (but, by gosh,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotionally stirring) rhetoric and most-extreme-example finger-pointing that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so typical of the status quo keepers. Sure, I'm for individual liberty like old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chuck. Sure, I think some people on the left sometimes react in extreme and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculous ways to imagined (or at least exaggerated) slights (as do people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all political persuasions). 
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that people on the left (and plenty on the right as well)
<br>
will try to turn their reactions into law, and they are the consummate
<br>
experts at demonizing their opponents and sowing mistrust of the
<br>
individual to sell people on the need for a new law that confiscates
<br>
somebody's civil rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But do I really need to dissect his speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point-by-point in order to show where sincere concern ends and (rather lame)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propagandizing begins? (Because I will.)
</em><br>
<p>Go for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; C'mon, Max. I'm all for individual liberty and an end to ridiculousness, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chuck Heston? Rush Limbaugh? They're reactionary gatekeepers in libertarian (I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the term generically here) clothing, exemplars of the old order who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriated tricks from their (sometimes imagined) opponents and turned them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back on them (often badly). Just because Heston's speech is a good speech (and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is) doesn't make it important. (I mean, Clinton delivered some damn fine speeches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and look where that ended up.)
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I feel your pain&quot; doesn't cut it.
