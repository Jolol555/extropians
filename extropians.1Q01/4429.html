Great post Anders, thanks.

<em>&gt;solar wind is now, it will really transfer heat to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;construction. You better have good cooling.
</em><br>
<p>Let me take it from here.  
<br>
<p>First let's flatten out the shell, dropping the caps down closer to the
<br>
star, and 'onto' the atmosphere.  The equatorial region can be balanced
<br>
against gravitaional collapse by spin, so the caps are the only parts that
<br>
really need to be 'held up'.
<br>
<p>Next, let's deal with the heat 'problem'.  I'd like to imagine that the
<br>
'upper' atmosphere might not be hot--that it might somehow be coo.  No way
<br>
are my skills up to the task of analyzing so unprecedented a condition of
<br>
atmospheric dynamics, so let me put my blissful ignorance to work and
<br>
suggest several mechanisms which might suggest the possibility of a
<br>
cool--or at least cooler--upper atmosphere: 1) the temperature profile of
<br>
other atmospheres provide examples: decreasing temperature with increasing
<br>
altitude; 2)  the outer layers of atmosphere may 'launch' gas particles
<br>
outward, whose kenetic energy is then sapped (they're cooled) by
<br>
gravitation.  
<br>
<p>On the other hand, since the projected radiation from the star is almost
<br>
entirely hydrogen emission, and the upper atmosphere is yet again more
<br>
hydrogen (of mixed species: monotomic, diatomic, plus ionized versions of
<br>
both), it can hardly be expected that it would be transparent to the
<br>
outbound radiation.  On the contrary, to whatever degree it is cooled, it
<br>
would seem to be primed to reabsorb and heat up.  But as I said, this is
<br>
way too complex an issue for me to assert anything with confidence.
<br>
<p>So maybe the supporting atmosphere is hot, maybe very hot.  We'll just have
<br>
to convert that heat 'problem' into an advantage.  That's what the Dyson
<br>
shell is about in the first place, right?  So where the shell gets hot, we
<br>
just harvest the heat.  Rather than photovoltaic energy harvesting, we go
<br>
for the old low-tech thermodynamic cycle, direct contact, heat source/heat
<br>
sink method.
<br>
<p>We're cookin' now.  Cookin' with gas.
<br>
<p>Into the breech! (With two ee's this time.)
