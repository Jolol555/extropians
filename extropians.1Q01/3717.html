[ I pass this along in my continuing reportage on the anti-technology front.  
<br>
Note the way that this material is presented as &quot;questioning the safety of GE 
<br>
orgainisms and the ethics of genetic engineering,&quot; then you note that all the 
<br>
sponsoring organizations are explicitly anti-technology activist groups. ]
<br>
<p><p>SAVE THE DATE!
<br>
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 16th, 2001
<br>
6:30- 9:00pm
<br>
NO ADVANCE REGISTRATION NECESSARY!
<br>
<p>FREE Public Forum on Genetic Engineering!
<br>
<p>Come hear the reasons why a recent New York Times front page article claims
<br>
the biotechnology industry is 'in trouble'!
<br>
<p>Where: Conference Center, Apparel Center at Merchandise Mart
<br>
<p>(the north bank of the Chicago River, between Wells and Orleans Streets,
<br>
Merchandise Mart Brown Line el stop, wheelchair accessible)
<br>
<p>Speakers presenting a critique of genetic engineering, public discussion
<br>
with genetic engineering activists in Chicago for a weekend of strategy
<br>
sessions, and information tables.
<br>
<p>Speakers include:
<br>
<p>Brian Tokar, Institute for Social Ecology &amp; Northeast Resistance Against
<br>
Genetic Engineering.  Brian will serve as the panel's moderator, and will
<br>
also open the evening with an overview of the concerns raised by genetic
<br>
engineering.
<br>
<p>Brian has been an activist since the 1970s in the peace, anti-nuclear,
<br>
environmental and Green politics movements, and is currently a faculty
<br>
member at the Institute for Social Ecology and Goddard College in Vermont.
<br>
He is the author of The Green Alternative (1987, revised 1992) and Earth
<br>
for Sale (1997), and his new book, Redesigning Life?, an international
<br>
collection on the politics and implications of biotechnology, will be
<br>
published early in 2001 by Zed Books.  Brian graduated from MIT in 1976
<br>
with degrees in biology and physics and received his Masters degree in
<br>
biophysics from Harvard University in 1981.
<br>
<p>Marsha Darling, Associate Professor and Director, Center for African
<br>
American and Ethnic Studies Programs, Adelphi University.  Marsha will
<br>
describe how the privatization of the gene industry evolved, and will
<br>
describe the meaning of intellectual property rights and patents.  She will
<br>
also discuss the biodiversity issues that the gene business invokes,
<br>
bioagriculture and especially the impact of corporate interest in
<br>
indigenous peoples' mineral, human and plant genetic materials on the
<br>
dynamics that drive international development.
<br>
<p>Marsha previously taught in Georgetown University's Women's Studies
<br>
department, and has a long research history in the areas of biotechnology's
<br>
impacts on indigenous and minority communities, feminism, reproductive
<br>
rights and technologies, and international development.
<br>
<p>Percy Schmeiser, Saskatoon, Canada. For 40 years, Percy Schmeiser has grown
<br>
canola on his farm usually sowing each crop of the oil-rich plants with
<br>
seeds saved from the previous harvest. And he has never purchased seed from
<br>
the St. Louis, Mo.-based agricultural and biotechnology giant Monsanto Co.
<br>
Even so, he says that more than 320 hectares of his land is now
<br>
&quot;contaminated&quot; by Monsanto's herbicide-resistant Roundup Ready canola. And,
<br>
like hundreds of other North American farmers, Schmeiser has felt the sting
<br>
of Monsanto's long legal arm: last August the company took the 68-year-old
<br>
farmer to court, claiming he illegally planted the firm's canola without
<br>
paying a $37-per-hectare fee for the privilege. Schmeiser fought back. He
<br>
claims Monsanto investigators trespassed on his land -- and that company
<br>
seed could easily have blown on to his soil from passing canola-laden
<br>
trucks. &quot;I never put those plants on my land,&quot; says Schmeiser. &quot;The
<br>
question is, where do Monsanto's rights end and mine begin?&quot;
<br>
<p>Chaia Heller, Institute for Social Ecology.  The debate over GMOs is more
<br>
than a debate about the risks and benefits associated with a new genetic
<br>
technology.  It is also a debate over power; about the power to determine
<br>
not only matters of science and technology, but matters of social and
<br>
economic life generally. Chaia will explore ways to radicalize the debate
<br>
over GMOs, linking questions of technology to vital issues of democracy,
<br>
freedom, and quality of life in an age of globalization.
<br>
<p>Chaia has taught ecological philosophy and feminist theory at the Institute
<br>
for Social Ecology in Vermont for almost two decades.  During this time,
<br>
Chaia has also been involved in the ecology and feminist movements an
<br>
activist, educator, and writer.  Currently, Chaia is researching the
<br>
controversy surrounding genetically manipulated organisms in France.  She
<br>
has recently published Ecology of Everyday Life: Rethinking the Desire for
<br>
Nature, Black Rose Books.
<br>
<p>Dr. Gregor Wolbring, University of Calgary, International Network on
<br>
Bioethics &amp; Disability, and the Edmonds Institute.
<br>
<p>Farmers and disabled people are groups who are both quite strongly affected
<br>
by the food and human genetics debates. This talk will highlight some of
<br>
the similarities between farmers and disabled people from around the world
<br>
in regards to the debate of food/human biotechnology issues.
<br>
<p>Gregor is a research scientist at the Department of Biochemistry and
<br>
Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine at the University of Calgary and an
<br>
Adjunct Assistant Professor (specialization bioethics) at the Dept. of
<br>
Community Rehabilitation and Disability studies, Faculty of Education at
<br>
the University of Calgary.
<br>
<p>This free public forum is sponsored by the Genetic Engineering Action
<br>
Network, USA and Sustain.
<br>
<p>GEAN is a national network of more than 80 organizations working to address
<br>
the risks and concerns about genetic engineering.  GEAN exists to support
<br>
and further the work of those organizations and individuals working to
<br>
address the risks to the environment, biodiversity and human health, as
<br>
well as the socioeconomic and ethical consequences of genetic engineering.
<br>
Some of GEAN's members include Greenpeace, the Organic Consumers
<br>
Association, GE Free LA, Northeast Resistance Against Genetic Engineering,
