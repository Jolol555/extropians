<em>&gt;Chapela is also worried about the lack of civic discourse. But the advocates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are talking, particularly among themselves. At a Berkeley conference, one of

<em>&gt;an open letter to Mother Nature:

<p>Hey, I didn't have a drop to drink until *after* that talk.
<br>
<p>Too bad the writer forgot all about the sober analysis in my talk following 
<br>
that call to arms. I suppose mentioning that wouldn't suit her purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and include Nobel laureate scientists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;This is no 'marginal' movement or way of thinking,&quot; Chapela says. &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;group advocating human re-engineering includes extremely powerful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influential and wealthy people. So don't expect them to roll over easily or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;soon.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>Fortunately this is true. I'm hearing supportive comments from a growing 
<br>
number of people in positions of influence who have plenty of resources at 
<br>
their command, such as William Haseltine, CEO of Human Genome Sciences, and 
<br>
Craig Venter, CEO of Celera Genomics, as well as the irrepressible James 
<br>
Watson.
<br>
<p>Since we're currently working on the FAQ, it seems that we should be able 
<br>
extract a couple of important question from this article that need 
<br>
answering. For instance, one would tackle the question of the 
<br>
&quot;commodification&quot; of humans. This issue first came up in journals on the 
<br>
philosophy of sports where issues of performance enhancement have been 
<br>
addressed rigorously. One person who has done excellent work in this area 
<br>
is USC law professor  Michael Shapiro, who spoke at EXTRO-4.
<br>
<p>Onward!
