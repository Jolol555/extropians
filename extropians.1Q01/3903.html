<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;Thus my suggestion that a malpractice lawsuit for failure to notify,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;inform, recommend, or apply cryonic suspension as a 'final meliorative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;clinical intervention against irreversible morbidity'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;Let's see Peter Jennings smirk at that!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Just what Americans need - more reasons to be litigious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I sincerely hope that Extropians can approach their problems more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethically.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; What you may object to is the results of litigation that have arisen in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US over the last few decades as the web of property rights and rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the personal responsibility of plaintiffs that used to be a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the common law here has eroded.  That is not the fault of the basic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time-tested system of private enforcement of rights through civil litigation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but rather in most cases is the result of legislatures and judges that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost the sense of balance between &quot;civil&quot; rights and property rights that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marked the central strength of the Anglo-American common law until very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent times.
</em><br>
<p>I would also say that you'd be lucky to find a judge who would not throw
<br>
the case out as frivolous today. Doesn't mean I think the case would be
<br>
frivolous. The closer reanimation gets, the better the chances of the
<br>
lawsuit going forward, and the higher the likelihood of public opinion
<br>
going the way Greg has recently posted re cloning. The framing of the
<br>
poll questions matters much, too.
