<p>To the cynical &quot;people are no damn good&quot; liberal type, I can see how
<br>
they would come to this conclusion, wrong as it is. So long as your
<br>
total mistrust of your fellow human beings colors the policies you
<br>
espouse, you will continue to think doom and gloom scenarios are our
<br>
future.
<br>
Most of the have-nots do NOT resent the haves, they resent not having
<br>
the opportunity to become haves themselves. They buy the con
<br>
artist/demagogs' arguments that they are trying to get if for them, and
<br>
their claims that the haves are stopping them. Its crap as any
<br>
intelligent person will admit. The systems these con artists have set up
<br>
to 'help' people were actually structured to keep mass quantities of
<br>
voters oppressed as serfs. Demagogs understand the client/patron
<br>
relationship very well (as do oppressed people) and think that that is
<br>
the default way of things. Restricting the opportunities of people while
<br>
claiming to help them is the name of the cynical liberals' game.
<br>
Its no wonder the minority Democrats are calling Colin Powell an 'uncle
<br>
tom' at the same time he's on nationwide commercials for his private
<br>
charitable organization exhorting Americans to 'pull your weight'. They
<br>
resent being told they aren't wearing any clothes.
