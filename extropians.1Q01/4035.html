Robin asks,
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyone seen the answer to this question:  On how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes do two typical humans differ?
</em><br>
<p>According to what I have read, the primary causes of variability between
<br>
humans are what are called SNPs, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms.
<br>
These are places where different people's version of a gene varies in a
<br>
single nucleotide.  I have an A, you have a G.  According to an L.A. Times
<br>
article on Monday, SNPs account for about 85% of genetic variation.
<br>
<p>Genome researchers have identified approximately 3 million SNPs in the
<br>
human genome.  The data is still incomplete and some project that there
<br>
could be as many as 10 million SNPs.  However, according to the same
<br>
article, the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of SNPs identified so far are not
<br>
in gene-coding portions of the genome.  They don't give a figure for
<br>
what that means as far as SNPs that affect genes.
<br>
<p>Even if we know on how many places people can differ potentially, that
<br>
does not answer Robin's question, which is on how many of those places
<br>
two randomly chosen people would actually differ.  No doubt it would
<br>
depend on how closely related the people are, and perhaps on whether
<br>
they are from the same part of the world or the same ethnic group.
<br>
But I have not seen any figures on this.  Possibly they will not be
<br>
available until more people have been sequenced.
<br>
<p>Hal
