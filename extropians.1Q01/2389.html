</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; In theory, I might agree. In practice, I would not. [Meaning: it seems a far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretch to me.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First of all, I don't subscribe to the idea that we are in any way all the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this were true, it would imply that all people want to be treated the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I never ever said we are all the same nor implied it except that we all
<br>
share being human beings and therefore have everything in common that is
<br>
subsumed by that term.  The gist of my questions above is that by the
<br>
very fact of existing at all we as human beings exist as something,
<br>
exist with certain properties.  I would be quite surprised if the
<br>
commonalities of our humanness did not imply that there are basic ways
<br>
that we can be treated that are relatively much more advantageous to our
<br>
success and wellbeing than other ways we can be treated.  This is
<br>
nothing terribly complex and certainly does not imply that we all wish
<br>
to be treated exactly the same in ALL respects.  That is an unwarranted
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But let's assume that the nature of human beings is a given: all people want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be treated the same, in all respects. How do we then extrapolate human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights (R) from your definition? Why, we take the 'given nature' (N) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings (H), we take the environment into which these beings are placed
</em><br>
<p>You are assuming a straw-man that has nothing to do with what I wrote. 
<br>
Your formula has very little to do with what I said either as it does
<br>
not even specify what being satisfied consists of or what suffering is
<br>
or even begin to address the nature of human beings.  It is totally
<br>
free-floating.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Your (E) does not cleanly separate out the givens of nature (not all of
<br>
which are in (N)) from human institutions which are not givens but part
<br>
of what needs be determined based upon (N).  This muddies things up
<br>
nicely.  Mars and other extreme environments are irrelevant.  You must
<br>
follow strict rules on earth not to come to an untimely in also.  This
<br>
does not imply that the rights of humans are any different at all
<br>
though.  Rules are not the same as (E) except for natural facts such as
<br>
being unable to survive on a diet of cyanide.  Rules imposed by a
<br>
society are another matter entirely.  Your #3 does not hold and
<br>
therefore your #4 is also pointless.
<br>
<p>N does not have to be defined with absolute scientific rigor to managed
<br>
to avoid denying the obvious.  
<br>
<p>Nice strawman.
