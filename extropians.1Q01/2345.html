<em>&gt; Given the apparent volatility of the weather as well as rapid technological

<em>&gt; firms and states. At the level of the business firm, greatest flexibility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results from maintaining a small core group of relatively permanent 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This makes sense.  I'd also like to see a greater role for the market in
<br>
bringing all the relevant information to bear on how much we need to cut
<br>
back.  Robin Hanson's Idea Futures idea, <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/ideafutures.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/ideafutures.html</a>,
<br>
describes how we could get quantitative estimates of what likely future
<br>
impacts are of global warming.  This mechanism should be relatively free
<br>
of political bias.  We could then use these estimates to set desirable
<br>
emissions levels and use tradeable emission rights to get the greatest
<br>
emission reductions for the smallest costs.
<br>
<p>There is still an element of policy here, where we go
<br>
from the quantitative estimates of sea level increase (and
<br>
other impacts) to setting emissions limits.  Robin's Futarchy
<br>
(<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html</a>) goes beyond this to simply set a
<br>
goal such as maximizing GWP, and automatically implementing policies
<br>
relating to emission caps which the Idea Futures market predicts
<br>
will achieve that goal.  Maybe the cheapest thing is to let the sea
<br>
rise and build walls around coastal cities, for example.  Whatever the
<br>
alternatives, we can use Robin's proposed markets to give us predictions
<br>
as to which will work best.

<br>
<p>P.S. The online Foresight Exchange game is giving 30% odds of a 1 meter
<br>
rise in seal level before 2030.  I thinkmost experts would say this
<br>
is insane.  <a href="http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=SLvl">http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=SLvl</a>.
