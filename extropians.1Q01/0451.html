<p>Gene Patent Guidelines Issued 
<br>
Reuters 
<br>
4:45 p.m. Jan. 5, 2001 PST 
<br>
<p><p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released new guidelines on Friday meant to clarify the controversial and ambiguous business of patenting genes. 
<br>
<p>The rules were intended to help end what has become an acrimonious debate on patenting genes, a multimillion-dollar business for many companies. 
<br>
<p>They put to rest any question about whether genes can be patented -- making it clear that companies may do so, though they may not patent mere genetic sequences or pieces of genes. 
<br>
<p>&quot;But when the inventor also discloses how to use the purified gene isolated from its natural state, the application satisfies the 'utility' requirement,&quot; the new guidelines read. 
<br>
<p>The guidelines were barely changed from the interim rules issued a year ago, the Patent Office said. They leave biotech companies such as Rockville, Maryland-based Celera Genomics and Human Genome Sciences Inc. free to continue patenting the genes they are racing to identify. 
<br>
<p>Arguments against the whole idea of patenting genes -- based on the premise that genes are a part of nature and not an invention -- were soundly rejected by the Patent Office. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Several comments state that a gene is not a new composition of matter because it exists in nature, and/or that an inventor who isolates a gene does not actually invent or discover a patentable composition because the gene exists in nature,&quot; said the guidelines. 
<br>
<p>Another comment expressed concern that a person whose body includes a patented gene could be guilty of patent infringement. 
<br>
<p>After responding to more than a dozen such comments, the Patent Office said the law clearly allowed for genes to be patented, so long as those genes have been &quot;cloned&quot; or reproduced in the laboratory and their function defined. 
<br>
<p>&quot;An excised gene is eligible for a patent as a composition of matter or as an article of manufacture because that DNA molecule does not occur in that isolated form in nature,&quot; it said. &quot;Synthetic DNA preparations are eligible for patents because their purified state is different from the naturally occurring compound.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The Patent Office said the practice of patenting bits and pieces of nature was not new. &quot;For example, Louis Pasteur received U.S. Patent 141,072 in 1873, claiming 'yeast, free from organic germs of disease, as an article of manufacture',&quot; it said. &quot;Another example is an early patent for adrenaline.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The entire sequence of a gene does not have to be published to get it patented. &quot;Describing the complete chemical structure, i.e., the DNA sequence, is one method of describing a DNA molecule but it is not the only method,&quot; it said. 
<br>
<p>Companies have asked for patents on tens of thousands of human genes. Human Genome Sciences says it holds 159 patents on full-length genes, for example, and has filed applications on more than 16,000 genes.
