&gt; War On Drugs Targets Tech
&gt; 
&gt; By Lewis Z. Koch Special To Interactive Week,
&gt; 
&gt; The new scapegoat for the failed War on Drugs is, of all things, technology.
&gt; 
&gt; The 120-page December 2000 International Crime Threat Assessment report -
&gt; created by basically every federal law enforcement agency in the U.S. - is
&gt; riddled with examples of how computer technology has advanced the cause of
&gt; national and international crime. Modern telecommunications and information
&gt; systems, state-of-the-art communications equipment, computers - they're all
&gt; to blame.
&gt; 
&gt; What the report fails to squarely acknowledge is that the oil that fuels
&gt; organized crime in the U.S. and abroad, including terrorist organizations,
&gt; is profit from the trade in illegal drugs bound for the U.S. - billions of
&gt; dollars in profit from drug sales that enhance the power of international
&gt; crime cartels and their ability to corrupt police, judges and governmental
&gt; officials from Tijuana to Tanzania.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Through the use of computers, international criminals have an
&gt; unprecedented capability to obtain, process and protect information and
&gt; sidestep law enforcement investigations,&quot; the report stated. &quot;They can use
&gt; the interactive capabilities of advanced computers and telecommunications
&gt; systems to plot marketing strategies for drugs and other illicit
&gt; commodities, to find the most efficient routes and methods for smuggling
&gt; and moving money in the financial system and to create false trails for law
&gt; enforcement or banking security.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It goes on to assert: &quot;More threateningly, some criminal organizations
&gt; appear to be adept at using technology for counterintelligence purposes and
&gt; for tracking law enforcement activities.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, it's not our flawed drug policy that's to blame - it's new
&gt; technology.
&gt; 
&gt; Where All This Began
&gt; 
&gt; In 1937, Harry J. Anslinger, six years into his 30-year-reign as director
&gt; at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, testified before the U.S. Senate on
&gt; behalf of the &quot;Marihuana Tax Act.&quot; This delighted the Hearst newspapers,
&gt; which, lacking a real war to increase newspaper sales, launched an all-out
&gt; battle against demon marijuana. Here are a few excerpts from Anslinger's
&gt; sworn testimony. Clearly, our drug policy traces its roots to reasoning
&gt; that was as racist and alarmist as it was wildly inaccurate:
&gt; 
&gt; * &quot;There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are
&gt; Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz
&gt; and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana can cause white women
&gt; to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; * &quot;The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate
&gt; races.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; * &quot;Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity,
&gt; criminality and death.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; * &quot;Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; With Hearst's backing, Anslinger's war on marijuana escalated to an all-out
&gt; war on narcotics.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, after six and a half decades of speeches and hundreds of thousands,
&gt; perhaps millions, of arrests, convictions and sentences, what signs point
&gt; to even modest success in this multitrillion-dollar war against drugs? Drug
&gt; trafficking is the most profitable of all illegal activities, according to
&gt; the International Crime Threat Assessment.
&gt; 
&gt; Where Do We Go from Here?
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of rethinking the sanity of our basic policy on drugs, federal
&gt; police agencies appear bent on blaming technology - unbreakable encryption
&gt; via e-mail, encrypted cellular phones and faster, cheaper networked
&gt; computers - for the losses sustained in the drug war. This is clearly
&gt; nonsense.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1999 alone, Americans spent an estimated $63 billion on illegal drugs,
&gt; according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. And the National
&gt; Institute on Drug Abuse stated: &quot;The estimated total cost of drug abuse in
&gt; the United States - including health care and lost productivity - was $110
&gt; billion in 1995, the latest year for which data is available.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, a U.S. Customs Service report said the department will soon be
&gt; able to inspect only 1 percent of all goods entering the U.S.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the score after six and a half decades of our drug policy. Do we
&gt; have to wait until 2037 to recognize that we lost the Hundred Years' Drug
&gt; War? And,! in the meantime, will we see more and more attacks on technology
&gt; as the evil ally of narcotics?
&gt; 
&gt; The obvious yet politically difficult solution here is to remove the
&gt; profitability factor from drugs. Will there be more casualties? Will more
&gt; people succumb to addiction? Maybe. But don't we already have casualties?
&gt; You have to employ some tortured logic to rationalize how removing the
&gt; profit incentive from drug use could make things any worse than they are.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the Feds want to escalate the war as an excuse for having their way
&gt; with encryption. But encryption is an essential business tool and a means
&gt; of protecting our privacy. Outlawing it as a scapegoat of our drug policy
&gt; is like trembling in fear before the great Wizard of Oz and paying no
&gt; attention to the discredited man and his policies behind the curtain.
&gt; 
&gt; Introducing Lewis Koch's &quot;First Annual George Orwell 1984 Award&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; The prize, a 1949 first-edition copy of Orwell's 1984, worth about $100,
&gt; will be awarded to the reader who supplies the best tip about an
&gt; egregious assault on personal privacy. The judges will be yours truly, plus
&gt; Richard M. Smith and other officers of the Privacy Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; E-mail all suggestions to lzkoch@&lt;<a href="http://mediaone.netmediaone.net">http://mediaone.netmediaone.net</a>. All tips
&gt; will be held in strictest confidence, so the award might well go to
&gt; &quot;anonymous.&quot; All suggestions will be fully investigated and thoroughly
&gt; checked.
