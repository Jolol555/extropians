<p>Yes, but my point was that you can't do it by playing a lot of jazz

<em>&gt; &gt;the set of things which could possibly exist.  It supports

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This just proves my point. Not only do you define everything that exists

</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought of as well!  What &quot;uses&quot; do you have in mind, I find this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manoeuvre pointless. 
</em><br>
<p>Here, I think you're overlooking the difference between the physically
<br>
possible and the logically possible.  While it is logically possible
<br>
that non-physical things exist, it isn't physically possible.  The
<br>
physically possible is determined by the correct laws of physics,
<br>
whatever they may turn out to be.  The logically possible is bounded
<br>
only by the rules of logic.  It is logically possible for you to
<br>
psychokinetically cause a fork and spoon to dance in the air, but, as
<br>
far as we know, this is physically impossible.
<br>
<p>The point of figuring out what is physically possible should be
<br>
obvious to you; it has been the project of physicists and scientists
<br>
for centuries, and may well engage us for far longer than that.  The
<br>
utility of this knowledge has proven itself over and over again.
<br>
<p>One characteristic of physical objects are the objects such that it is
<br>
physically possible that they could exist.  This does not include
<br>
everything that could ever be thought of.  Fairies, for example, are
<br>
physically impossible, but could obviously be thought of.  Fairies are
<br>
not physical objects: they are fictional magical ones.  They are
<br>
logically possible, but physically impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are also committing a well-known error by conflating &quot;exists&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with &quot;physical&quot; (the same strategy that was used in one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-known arguments for the existence of God).
</em><br>
<p>I don't know that one.  I know quite a few of these, but it'd be
<br>
interesting to hear another.  Or maybe you have a different gloss on
<br>
an old argument?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;More to the point, it seems to be in opposition to theories like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;yours.  If &quot;physical&quot; meant nothing, or everything, you should be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to show that, under my own definition of &quot;physical,&quot; your theory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely .. under *your* definition of physical MVT is physical!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just don't find any value in your definition.
</em><br>
<p>I raised that point to emphasize that MVT is *not* physical, and,
<br>
therefore, if physicalism is correct, MVT is wrong.  My definition of
<br>
physical does *not* include non-verifiable mental objects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;But you can't do that.  You theory inherently relies on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;non-physical elements.  (Yet you try to claim the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;high-ground and resort to name-calling with cries of &quot;medievalism.&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is just the way we define things, I don't rely on any &quot;elements&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are not conceivable within your system, it is just that you want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call everything physical. Maybe the phantom eye concept is one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your &quot;counterfactuals&quot; .... but MVT offers several levels of explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and doesn't demand a leap of faith into the non-material. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy to  provide a descriptive level how the &quot;phantom&quot; pineal eye
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operates in terms of neural information, glandular and action potentials,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thus is experienced in the same way that externally originating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense-data/ neural information is experienced (as conscious &quot;behaviour&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is an ADDITIONAL level that MVT/ Third Eye (Kether, Eye of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shiva, Dharma Eye) can be understood that is beyond and above the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limitation of your syntax and knowledge, possibly, but this meditational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness state is not what we are discussing, as I am aware it goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond what can be described by biology and physics. Cultural &amp; mental,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, with &quot;consciousness correlates&quot; that have been identified by most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-era societies as the &quot;source&quot; of spirituality ... but not particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identified with your Charvaka (materialist) view ... the philosophy of ash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or dust ... the view that everything reduces to dust or atoms).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MVT promises to reduce supernaturalism as well as materialism, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it explains phenomena in more natural, basic terms. I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think, whatever you say, that &quot;time&quot; and &quot;meaning&quot; can be transformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into atomic quantities (dust in India 2,000bc was thought to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smallest particle). If your physicalism is anything more that a tautologous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition (which I assert it is) then you should have some evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything is atomic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; &gt;Well, my physicalism denies that symbols are anything more than their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; &gt;physical part.  e.g. Writing is nothing more than scratches on paper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; So all scratches on paper ARE writing? Ridiculous!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Forgive me.  Scratches on paper that are USED in a certain way by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people.  No non-physical component, unless you consider their use as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;kind of &quot;logical part,&quot; which is misleading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But your physicalism &quot;denies that symbols are anything more than their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical part.  e.g. Writing is nothing more than scratches on paper&quot; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now in response to my point you add a qualifier about &quot;USE&quot; made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, which seems an intentional quality rather than anything physical.
</em><br>
<p>I was *correcting* myself.  Note the use of &quot;forgive me.&quot;  While use
<br>
is &quot;intentional,&quot; &quot;intentions&quot; are properties of physical objects, and
<br>
are thus physical properties.  There's no non-physical thing at work
<br>
here.  Just physical brains and physical bodies emitting physical
<br>
sounds and making physical scratches on paper.  The scratches on paper
<br>
bear physical relations to other physical objects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Properties of a non-physical object?  No good.  As far as I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;concerned, ideas may be properties of physical objects, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;second-order properties of properties of physical objects, but at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;end of the day, it must be a physical property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this is pure conjecture, just your &quot;idea&quot;, what evidence do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you back this with? I can back up MVT with scientific experiment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and observation.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me?  Reread the claim that I made.  I said that there are only
<br>
physical objects and properties of physical objects.  You do *not*
<br>
have an experiment to show that there are non-physical objects.  You
<br>
might think that some of your experiments make it natural to assume
<br>
that there are some non-physical objects, but I happen to find that
<br>
notion rather unnatural.
<br>
<p>Aside from various intuitions that the physical fully describes what
<br>
can possibly exist, I also have the advantage of history.
<br>
Technological progress has largely been a picture of getting the gods,
<br>
ghosts and ghoulies out of the way.  It has been a bet that
<br>
traditional science is the finest tool available, and it has largely
<br>
paid off.
<br>
<p>It's clear that mental non-physical objects aren't verifiable by
<br>
today's science.  Behavior and brain states can be verified, but
<br>
consciousness can't.  We've agreed that it's a matter of aesthetic
<br>
taste as to whether your experiments imply that the &quot;phantom eye&quot; is a
<br>
non-physical object or whether all there is to it is conscious
<br>
behavior.

<em>&gt; Ah, but my system can cope with ALL the definitions, whereas your

<p>Primary sources are physical objects.  Faculties are properties of

physical objects.  As for the divine principle, physicalism obviously

denies that.  What's wrong with the way I &quot;cope?&quot;

<p><em>&gt; &gt;Seriously, try to engage with respect and empathy.  Try to figure out

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Within your strict set of closed definitions that everything (even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undiscovered)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MUST be physical, then you are right, but not otherwise. Anyway, how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you (of all people) expect me to *read your mind* when all you give out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and can give out) are physical scratches that I have to read literally!
</em><br>
<p>Empathy, of the ordinary kind.  It's a talent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are what you say .... whereas I am far, far more because my view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows for the possibility of any physical *or* non-physical properties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can identify with and &quot;understand&quot; fictional characters for instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although these fictions cannot be reduced to atoms.
</em><br>
<p>I can &quot;understand&quot; them, too, though I doubt we'll agree about them.
<br>
As far as physicalism is concerned, fictional characters just don't
<br>
exist.  They aren't atoms or anything else.  When we accept some truth
<br>
claims about fictional characters, we simply use the sentences in a
<br>
certain way, we physically interact with the physical words and brain
<br>
symbols.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;So I meant definition 1.  And laws, doctrines, assumptions, rules, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;codes are all statements, usually sentences.  Sentences ARE arrays of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;symbols.  But the key point I was making there is that even principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which are not written down as scratches on paper are encoded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physically in the brain: they are coded statements.  The brain is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;symbolic processor in this sense, just like the Turing machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Principles in the brain are complex arrays of brain symbols.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in a Turing machine everything is explicit, and somewhere on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tape you can read these arrays. In the brain they cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed or detected. What are &quot;brain symbols&quot; anyway, I have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard of these .....
</em><br>
<p>Brain symbols are abstract entities; they're the way information is
<br>
encoded in the brain.  It's intentionally pretty vague so as to make
<br>
it possible to have a discussion about them without necessarily
<br>
knowing the details.  We know that the brain stores information
<br>
somehow; when we refer to brain symbols we invoke &quot;whatever it is that
<br>
the brain is doing there.&quot;
<br>
<p>Every part of the brain can be observed, in principle if not today in
<br>
practice.  (You're not a Penrosian, are you?)  The brain follows all
<br>
the ordinary physical laws, and we can watch it do so under a
<br>
microscope.  Some aspects of brain functioning are opaque to us today,
<br>
but as nanotechnology develops we'll be able to observe the details
<br>
even more closely.  The brain &quot;cannot be observed&quot; only in the sense
<br>
that the workings of the Pentium III cannot be observed: they're both
<br>
very small and hard to watch closely with today's technology.  But
<br>
they're both Turing equivalents.  (Equivalents.  Not machines.
<br>
Equivalents.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; Are you claiming your strange definition is correct and *everybody*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; else including the Oxford English Dictionary is wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;No, I claim that you failed to understand what I said, because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;were looking for a way to make me wrong, rather than looking for how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or why I could possibly be right.  You picked the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;interpretation, instead of the right one.  See how that's a waste of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;our time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not my job to argue your case or to pretend to agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you when I do not see any merit in your argument. If I have a choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you are not presenting a very water-tight case.
</em><br>
<p>No one can present a case so water-tight that you can't interpret it
<br>
in some perverse way.  This is a matter of interpretation so as to
<br>
maximize correctness.  I'm not saying that at the end of the day you
<br>
need to agree with me, but you need to interpret what I say such that
<br>
it is as agreeable as possible.  This may turn out to be less
<br>
agreeable than your own position, but until you do the earlier work,
<br>
you'll never know.  It's easy to find dumb interpretations, and if you
<br>
stop there you'll never understand your opponents' arguments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To be honest, I still fail to see how (any kind of) &quot;principle&quot; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be physical.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Principles&quot; (of the first kind) are sentences.  Do you see how
<br>
sentences can be physical?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't ask you to  agree with my views unchallenged.
</em><br>
<p>Neither do I.  But you should expect me to interpret your words in a
<br>
charitable way.  Discussion is hellish if not impossible without it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are records of young car crash victims who lived an apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal life, but on autopsy it was discovered that only 5% of their brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had been functioning! If brain damage occurs at an early enough age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is plastic enough that any part of the brain can take over functions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other part ... so you are wrong in fact on this issue.
</em><br>
<p>I knew this, and nothing I said contradicts this.  All I insist is
<br>
that the brain has a non-plastic property or two, that it's not protean
<br>
in quite *every* way.  The characteristics which it can't change are
<br>
the hardware.  The ones that it can change are the software.  The
<br>
hardware of the brain happens to be Turing equivalent.  Some of the
<br>
hardware of the brain, like the laws of physics, can't break at all
<br>
(and so it's obviously nonsense to talk about self-repair in those
<br>
cases).  But some of the hardware of the brain can break in a
<br>
non-reparable way.  When it does, the brain is as helpless as a Turing
<br>
machine with a broken servo.  Hardware need not be fragile, but the
<br>
brain does have some.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;They are both equivalent in behavior to a Turing machine.  Therefore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; t&gt;hey both share the limitations of a Turing machine.  One of them is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;distributed parallel system, and the other one isn't.  But (pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;attention now) that is irrelevant to the claim I'm making.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Distributed parallel systems are equivalent to Turing machines in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;behavior.  They can't do anything a big fast Turing machine couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have already decided that *real-time* responses cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated.
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant.  The limitations to which I refer are not speed-related.
<br>
I'm happy to admit that neural computers can outstrip serial Turing
<br>
machines in speed in solving some problems.  (Though not all.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Neither could a big Turing machine have evolved.
</em><br>
<p>Also irrelevant.  Being evolved or not has nothing to do with
<br>
behavior, nothing to do with today's limitations.  You're telling me
<br>
properties they don't share.  I agree with you about these.  I'm
<br>
telling you some properties that they DO share.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The brain can develop entirely new modules (eg. the neocortex)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in response to changing environmental demands, how would your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing machine do this?
</em><br>
<p>You'll hate my answer.  The brain can't develop entirely new hardware.
<br>
Entirely new physical layout is not hardware: it's software.  Hardware
<br>
is the part you can't change, by definition.  Neither can the brain
<br>
develop software beyond what its hardware allows, neither can the
<br>
brain develop software in some non-deterministic non-random way.  So,
<br>
what can the brain do?  Develop &quot;new&quot; modules following the rules
<br>
encoded in its hardware.  The Turing machine could do that, too, if it
<br>
were fast enough.  (And, again, speed is irrelevant to my claims about
<br>
general limitations.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Neither one can change their own &quot;hardware,&quot; by definition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wrong, see above. I suppose you might be right in the case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some artificial silicon neural-computers, since these are designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and manufactured, but this is not true of brains, which are plastic.
</em><br>
<p>I think you missed my point here.  The definition of hardware is &quot;the
<br>
characteristics of the system which cannot be changed internally.&quot;
<br>
The brain has some of those.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; You persist with the old hardware/ software language that just doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; cut it when examining neural computers .... there is not software, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; weight-states ... evolution sculpts the response directly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What's wrong with calling that software, exactly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because it isn't arrays or streams of signals (code), it is electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charge only .... there is no symbolic equivalent. You get  the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types of computers to behave similarly, but the method by which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach this behavior is not equivalent or even similar. Your Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or von Neumann machine also has electrical pulse, but this is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you mean by &quot;software&quot; ... and nor is the same as &quot;weight states&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as these carry different information than logic gate arrays &amp;c.
</em><br>
<p>They only need to have a few characteristics in common to be &quot;similar&quot;
<br>
in the way I mean.  As far as I'm concerned, transistors and wooden
<br>
rods are &quot;equivalent&quot; for the purposes of this conversation: the rods
<br>
of Babbage's engine are equivalent to the transistors in modern-day
<br>
desktops.  They have little in common (and heaven knows that no
<br>
wooden-rod computer could have evolved under normal circumstances),
<br>
but just enough to make my point. The computers themselves are
<br>
analogous to individual neurons, but the arrangement of neurons is
<br>
analogous to the connection of many computers, of many Turing
<br>
machines, which is equivalent in behavior to one big fast Turing
<br>
machine.
<br>
<p>If anything, you might try poking holes at my claim that many Turing
<br>
machines hooked together are equivalent to one big Turing machine
<br>
(since, of course, the one big one couldn't do what the many little
<br>
ones could as quickly, or in quite the same way) but the analogy
<br>
between a neuron and a Turing machine is pretty strong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Look, I'm not going to *bother* to cite this no-brainer.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;characteristics of the brain are non-plastic.  The fact that the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;can't change the laws of physics implies that the laws of physics can,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;if need be, serve as the non-plastic element.  I'm not making a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;large assumption here, but important conclusions follow from this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;obvious point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Laws of Physics might be unalterable, but where do these disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the proven facts (can provide car crash refs if needed) that the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (pretty much all of it) can be reconfigured for different tasks, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and neurones are constantly dying, creating new connections, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically migrating during early brain formation.
</em><br>
<p>Look, we agree that almost all of the brain can change, but I hope you
<br>
notice that almost completely plastic does not imply completely
<br>
plastic.  There's some non-plastic properties to the brain.  At least
<br>
one.  For example, the brain can't change the laws of physics: the
<br>
brain has all the properties which physical objects must have, and
<br>
can't change any of those.  I'm making a very small claim when I say
<br>
that there's at least one property that doesn't change.  I understand
<br>
that most of it can change.  It's the bit that can't that I'm
<br>
interested in.  The bit that can't is the brain's hardware.
<br>
Everything else is software.  That's because the hardware just is the
<br>
part that can't be changed internally, by definition.  The brain has
<br>
some hardware.  That hardware is analogous to Turing machine hardware,
<br>
which also can't be changed internally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Because materialism is scientific.  Materials can be scientifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;verified.  Phenomena cannot.  No other philosophical theory, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;MVT, can claim the scientific high ground.  We need nothing more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the materials to explain everything material.  Why invoke the ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;when we have a science of materials?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But only &quot;materials&quot; can be verified (molecular descriptions?) by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, whereas you widen the claim for physicality to everything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even principles, which cannot be verified as materials. No  way.
</em><br>
<p>Sentences *are* physical.  I can not only point sentences, I can even
<br>
drop them on my foot.  You KNOW something's physical when you can drop
<br>
it on your foot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, ditch the philosophy by all means. It is quite inadequate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I argue for a post-human aesthetic that can embrace the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful new vocabulary and world-view that MVT offers. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many various mental phenomena can all be described using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evolutionary narrative (scientific) offered by MVT, whereas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old philosophical jargon offers nothing. I disagree with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that functionalism solves Leibnitz Law , by the way, on any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level other than by linguistic contrivance. MVT offers a constructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconciliation by means of the virtual generic sensor as a bridge.
</em><br>
<p>Here, I think, you just referred to an argument which you might
<br>
present, but didn't actually bring one to the table.  Obviously a
<br>
functionalist might say the same about MVT.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Not very.  All physical objects can be pointed to.  You cannot point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at any properties, however.  Time is a property of a physical object.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It is not a physical object, but it is a physical property.  Same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;thing with length.  You cannot point to two inches, but you can point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to objects which are two inches long, and no non-physical things have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the property of being two-inches long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God is a fictional character .... he cannot be pointed to so is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a physical object ... but how is he a &quot;property of a physical object?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Fictional characters aren't properties of physical objects.  They
<br>
aren't anything at all.  We accept some truth claims about them, but
<br>
that's a relationship between us and the sentences, not between
<br>
anything and the characters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What you call a &quot;physical property&quot; could equally well be described as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;concept.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The words &quot;property&quot; and &quot;concept&quot; are often used interchangably, but,
<br>
of course, one of them is held by the object with nobody else around,
<br>
the other is something that we have relative to the object.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Because even under idealism there will be a difference between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hallucinations of brains and minds.  The one will be a &quot;physical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hallucination, under that wacky definition, but even then, the mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;STILL won't be &quot;physical.&quot;  Same old problem, even under a radically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bizarre definition of &quot;physical.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, idealism (an human-era philosophical device, like physicalism)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives some bizarre conclusions ... but no more bizarre than your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view, and equally (or even less) unprovable.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you're missing my point.  My point is that you raised idealism
<br>
as if it were an argument for MVT, when it is anything but.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; but I actually think the distinction between phyical and mental is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blurred,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; the shape of the body changes the shape of the mind, and the shape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; of the mind affects the shape and action of the body (Aristotle).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Aristotle didn't know, just as Descartes didn't know, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical world is causally closed.  That was our original problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you'll recall.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quantum physics allows (theoretically) non-causal effects, action at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a distance and so on.
</em><br>
<p>We can get rid of these with MWI, but, if you like, we can even accept
<br>
the Copenhagen interpretation with spooky action-at-a-distance stuff
<br>
and still notice that all you get in the world are determined effects
<br>
and random effects.  Neither of these are mental effects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We also cannot describe what &quot;Laws&quot; are in operation at the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity in a black hole.
</em><br>
<p>So what?  There are no black holes in the brain.  The laws of physics
<br>
operate just fine there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On macro-level description, Aristotle seems to be correct. And we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can think, plan and mentally model (internal thought, not possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to E-2 animals!?)  action before manifesting it physically. The mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affects the body.
</em><br>
<p>Deep Blue can and does internally model the board before making a
<br>
move.  (Will you at least grant the machine that?  It literally has
<br>
symbolic pictures of the board stored in its RAM.  That's a model,
<br>
by anyone's account.)  But no one's mind affects Deep Blue when it
<br>
does this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the loss of the pineal eye explains how &amp; why modern brains AND their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanying mental life evolved, then this is our best shot at clearing up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated problems (Globus' and Menakers's theories in physiology) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting rid of philosophical quandaries. I challenge you to suggest another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural/ physiological scenario that resolves Leibnitz Law ... Putnam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just doesn't cut it.
</em><br>
<p>Yet you claim it's a matter of opinion.  As far as I can tell, your
<br>
account is &quot;deeper&quot; than Putnam's only in your claim that
<br>
consciousness is not-having certain brain capacities.  But you claim
<br>
that Putnam doesn't cut it, that having certain capacities is not
<br>
consciousness.  But if *having* capacities is not consciousness,
<br>
you've got quite an uphill battle to show how *not* having capacities
<br>
is consciousness.  The intuition is obvious: capacities are different
<br>
from feelings.  They're logically distinguishable.  But the link
<br>
between them is unexplained in Putnam's account and in your own.
<br>
If Putnam doesn't cut it, you don't cut it either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;And, I argue, the reverse of the case: MVT FAILS under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all explanatory accounts.  It's no good under idealism, no good under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physicalism, no good under dualism (even scalar dualism), it's just no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;good, unless you resort to equating MVT with MVT', which is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;acceptable interpretative manoeuvre, but makes your theory no theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;consciousness at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MVT doesn't fail .... Idealism, Dualism and Physicalism fail!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bye bye to failed lingoistic philosophy. None of these accounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolves the mind-body problem .... physicalism might try to deny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mental, but still cannot overcome the Identity = Interchangeability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue because the thoughts of the brain ARE NOT the cellular matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the brain, however you cut it (even as &quot;properties&quot; or &quot;conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour.&quot;) They may correlate with, but are not &quot;fully interchangeable&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the language used to describe each type is different.
</em><br>
<p>Look, you've got interchangability problems, too.  If the pineal eye
<br>
is a feeling, then it's interchangable with mental statements, but
<br>
it's not interchangable with claims about cellular material.  A
<br>
feeling, on your terms, is more than not-having cellular capacities.
<br>
But if the phantom pineal eye is just the absence of the pineal eye,
<br>
then it's not a feeling.
<br>
<p>You say it's &quot;abstract,&quot; but that's just an opaque term to hide the
<br>
fact that you haven't solved this problem at all.  We have different
<br>
beliefs about feelings and physical stuff.  We say different things
<br>
about them.  If you conflate the physical absent capacity with the
<br>
feeling, you'll feel real good about yourself, but you won't have
<br>
solved the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if you claim this, then &quot;brain states&quot; and &quot;thinks&quot; are the same thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so you can substitute one for the other in any sentence without changing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning? Is this what you are saying?
</em><br>
<p>They are, of course, different parts of speech.  To be precise: &quot;is
<br>
thinking&quot; is interchangable with &quot;is in certain brain states.&quot;  &quot;is
<br>
thinking about X&quot; is interchangable with &quot;has certain brain symbols
<br>
which refer to X.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Yes, meaning is as physical as an air-wave.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can measure sound in decibels, or with an air sock.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It has location, speed, frequency and other physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do I measure &quot;meaning&quot; ..... what tests can I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what physical measurements do I take, using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what instruments?
</em><br>
<p>Lexicography.  Sociology.  Anthropology.  Meaning is use.  You look
<br>
and see how people use the words.  You write it down.  You publish
<br>
articles about it.  You participate in the writing of dictionaries and
<br>
encyclopaedias.  Did you not notice that Linguistics is a science?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When I simulate a neural network that does this on my desktop, is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;exhibiting a program or constraints?  I'm not conflating these;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they're the same.  The presence or absence of a human programmer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;doesn't imply that it's not a program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree that a serial simulation is identical with a physical, parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantiation ... they may exhibit behaviour that we think is equivalent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but one is algorithmic and provable at any point, and the other is not.
</em><br>
<p>Both are algorithmic, but one has a more complex program than the
<br>
other.  Look at actual parallel neural computers.  There is absolutely
<br>
an algorithm which completely describes their behavior.  It's a bitch
<br>
to write down, but it's obviously there.  Stringing together
<br>
algorithmic components makes for a more complex algorithmic object,
<br>
not something radically non-algorithmic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, reciprocally, there is not task that can be performed by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (dumb but fast) Turing machine or von Neumann that cannot be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using parallel distributed architectures .....  but I do not claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow von Neumann processors are REALLY neural computers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that neural architecture has *anything whatsoever* to do with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design or evolution. They are just a (less optimised) alternative!
</em><br>
<p>Turing machines ARE neural computer equivalents.  But that says more
<br>
about the neural computers than it does about Turing machines.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;No, this is not an explanation.  You don't explain why we necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have a feeling when we have physical (in)capacities.  Here, you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;re-insist that we DO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The medical literature on why (in ALL cases of recorded traumatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organ loss) we have phantom sensations explains this point adequately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a necessity about such phenomena, not a voluntary choice.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I agree that people feel that way.  You don't tell me anything
<br>
about the mechanism by which people feel.  You tell me about the
<br>
mechanism by which people act like they're in pain.  But you can't
<br>
show me how the pain links up with the brain states.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;No.  There's no gestalt when one link in the chain is missing: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;link between the physical (in)capacities and the feelings, on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The neurosignatures are generated along with 'phantom eye'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information thereby identifying this information as &quot;self&quot; originating,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but distinct from signals originating at the retina and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I accept Melzacks' neuromatrix theory of self, by and large.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this is not enough.  Identification as &quot;self&quot; originating might
<br>
be the same as feeling, depending on what you meant by
<br>
&quot;identification.&quot;  If it IS the same as feeling, you've left it a
<br>
mystery HOW this &quot;identification&quot; feeling happens, which is different
<br>
from (ta-da) identification brain states.  If it isn't, then you've
<br>
left the feelings mysterious and told me all about brain states.
<br>
<p>No solution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Neural computers, all of them, are Turing machine equivalents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No ... as discussed above, I can simulate all the behaviours of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing machine on neural systems, but they are not identical.
</em><br>
<p>Read what I said.  Read what you said.  I said &quot;equivalent.&quot;  You said
<br>
&quot;identical.&quot;  You ignore what I say and knock down a straw man who
<br>
thinks that they're identical.  What's the point?  Pay attention.
<br>
&quot;Equivalence&quot; and &quot;identity&quot; are radically different relations.
<br>
<p>To be &quot;equivalent&quot; is to have one relevant property in common.  To be
<br>
&quot;identical&quot; is to have ALL of one's properties in common.  If you say
<br>
&quot;I need a green thing! bring me a pear!&quot; and I bring you a green
<br>
apple, you say &quot;this is not an pear!&quot; I'll say &quot;I know, but this apple
<br>
is equivalent to the pear: they are both green.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is foolish to then say &quot;but pears are different from apples!&quot;
<br>
because we both know that.  The question is whether they are different
<br>
in a RELEVANT way.  They need not be identical to be equivalent.  Get it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You accept that the Turing machine is running neural simulations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lock-step (very fast, but not INSTANT) .. and so you fail on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalence claim just on the real-time property alone .... and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think there are further differences.
</em><br>
<p>The fact that they differ on one property, or two, or a hundred, or
<br>
even more properties, doesn't imply that they aren't equivalent.  They
<br>
only need to share the relevant properties (which, as far as I'm
<br>
concerned, are only one or two).
<br>
<p>I'm definitely starting to tire here... as school starts up again, I
<br>
may have to drop this end.  We'll see how much longer I can go.
