|If you disagree with any of these memes, could you wave a hand and 
<br>
|explain why?
<br>
<p>Yes, I could (and did).
<br>
<p>The memes lacked information on WHO did the action.
<br>
<p>Did you intend a general moral theory (&quot;ONE SHOULD DO &lt;x&gt;&quot;),
<br>
a moral theory for the members of this list (&quot;WE SHOULD DO &lt;x&gt;&quot;),
<br>
or what?
<br>
<p>|1. Forcing our fellow human beings to live their lives as we see fit
<br>
|   is unethical. (Persuading them of the error of their ways so that
<br>
|   they _choose_ to live their lives by our lights is another matter.)
<br>
<p>1. One should not force a fellow human how to live their lives.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(One may persuade them to _choose_ to do that, however.)
<br>
<p>[Do we need the &quot;human&quot; part?
<br>
&nbsp;One should also specify the meaning of &quot;persuade&quot;:
<br>
&nbsp;some may consider e.g. electric chocks a persuasion method.]
<br>
<p>|2. Initiating violence against someone is wrong; self-defense is right.
<br>
<p>2. Nobody should initiate violence against anybody else.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everone may defend themselves, however.
<br>
<p>[This lacks information on what entities constitutes the basic group.
<br>
&nbsp;Thousand years ago one could kill a foreigner as they were not one of us.
<br>
&nbsp;Today we cannot do that, but we can kill and torture chimpanzees.
<br>
&nbsp;A definition on the basic group will make this more obvious.
<br>
&nbsp;If the basic group requires e.g. intelligence, etc., one should state this.]
<br>
<p>|3. The scientific method provides a better way of evaluating reality
<br>
|   than any religious dogma.
<br>
<p>3. One should use scientific method instead of religious dogma, since
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we observe that experimental knowledge works better than dogmnatic beliefs.
<br>
<p>[Any suggestions?]
<br>
<p>|4. Progress (increases in human intelligence, longevity, wealth, and
<br>
|   happiness) is possible.
<br>
<p>4. We can think better, live longer, have more wealth, and a happier life.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we like that, we call it &quot;progress&quot;.
<br>
<p>[Suggestions?]
<br>
<p>|5. Central control is usually less efficient than distributed control.
<br>
<p>5. We observe that systems with a centralized control breaks easier than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those with a distributed control.
<br>
<p>[Did you mean this?
<br>
&nbsp;Any unstated presumptions missing?]
<br>
<p>|6. Empowering people to learn, work, and transcend their limits is a good
<br>
|   thing.
<br>
<p>6. One should empower people to learn, work, and transcend their limits.
<br>
<p>[Did you intend this?]
