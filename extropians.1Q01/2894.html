<em>&gt;Why would you think libertarians should be utterly unconcerned with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people's education and skills? We're not all heartless SOBs you know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Besides, on a purely selfish and pragmatic basis it matters a great deal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me that people are skilled enough to power the economy forward. Who
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but that sounds like an empty catchphrase to me.
<br>
<p>BTW&lt; I don't find anything selfish about not caring whether X% of the 
<br>
populace cannot pass some meaningless math test; if they need to know it, 
<br>
they'll learn it. Most science PhD's have a problem finding a job.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think are going to create all those technological and scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;breakthroughs? (I'd add: without better critical and creative thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skills, who is going to understand the possibilities and adapt their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking to them?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To quote from the article:
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
&quot;it tested 57,000 job applicants in 1987 and found that 54,900, or 96.3%
<br>
lacked basic skills in math, reading, and reasoning.&quot;(35) A human resource
<br>
planning document prepared at the Bank of America in 1990 reported that
<br>
&quot;Chemical Bank in New York must interview 40 applicants to find one who can
<br>
be successfully trained as a teller&quot;;
<br>
<p>Guess all those tellers are going to make these scientific breakthroughs--if 
<br>
only they could learn their kitchen math, and pass a reading comp test!
<br>
<p><p>To put it bluntly, I think the &quot;studies&quot; quoted in the article are 
<br>
massaged/made-up to make a  point and thereby further 
<br>
corporate/political/interest-group agendas. Propaganda, bought and paid for. 
<br>
A media cliche, meaningless.
