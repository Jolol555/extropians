</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It also makes it less likely that an inmate will attack a prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;officer.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I would normally agree that positive reinforcement is to be

</em><br>
<p>Er, no.  We're discussing people who are in prison. They're in prison
<br>
because a negative reinforcement -- threat of imprisonment -- didn't
<br>
prevent them committing offenses while they were *out* of prison. Why
<br>
should threatening them with a negative reinforcement work while they're
<br>
*inside*?
<br>
<p>There are several reasons why people end up in prison. One is that
<br>
they may be participating in a victimless crime -- one that I assume
<br>
everybody on this list agrees *shouldn't* be a crime, but is -- and they
<br>
get careless or unlucky. (I'm going to ignore this category, with the
<br>
caveat that it could be my turn next -- or yours.) Another is that
<br>
they've got poor impulse control and act stupidly (and illegally) on
<br>
the spur of the moment. This latter group isn't going to stop acting
<br>
on impulse just because they've been plonked into a new environment.
<br>
However, if we can try to train them to consistently work towards a long-
<br>
term goal, we may be able to improve their impulse control. Guess what:
<br>
trying to qualify for early release has got to be a valid goal for a
<br>
prisoner! So there's one category of criminal who may find the 
<br>
opportunity for parole to be a major incentive to reform.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've never understood the parole system that well, every petty thug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can quote you how long he's likely to get for whatever crime they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are likely to commit, they already know the price and often can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make an excellent guess of how likely they are to get away with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what. This seems to be part of the problem.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The only problem here is that it sounds like parole is automatic, in
<br>
the system you're describing. The system *I'm* describing is one where
<br>
it isn't automatic: you qualify for it by good behaviour. Clear?
