<p>Hmmm... Solid fuels dont provide the ~4500 m/s you quoted.  The
<br>
4500 number applies to about the best liquid combination, lox and H2,
<br>
in vacuum.  Starting with a 50 pound rocket, I have some *serious*
<br>
doubts we could make it to orbit with 7 pounds.  I might believe
<br>
7 ounces however.
<br>
<p>Ross, if you have a serious interest in rocketry, get up to speed
<br>
on the equations.  They really are not as complicated as the
<br>
term rocket science implies.  In fact rocketry is one of those
<br>
few fields where everything really is pretty straightforward,
<br>
not mysterious, and everything has already been worked out.
<br>
<p>For a good estimate of what can be done, look at what
<br>
*has* been done.  Look up on the web the Saturn V, for
<br>
instance, see how much mass it started with and how much
<br>
made it to orbit.  Look up Orbital Sciences, Pegasus rocket,
<br>
see its mass and how much it can carry to orbit, recalling that
<br>
it is captive carried on an airplane.  Look up Atlas Centaur.
<br>
Educate yourself as much as possible.  You have a device
<br>
of unimaginable power right before you, the web.  Use it.
