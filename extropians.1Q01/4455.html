<p>**Not at all--but religion is a far more powerful force in all of

these nations than it is here, and Islamic leaders can and have been 
<br>
toppled for religious reasons. There are lines they will not cross 
<br>
(or will die or lose power upon crossing). Egypt? Look what happened 
<br>
to Sadat for valuing international relations over religious

divisions.

<p>**Okay.

<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>**Certainly not. But not all Islamic nations have such resources which
<br>
&nbsp;are desired by the industrialized world.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are serious problems with civil liberties that
<br>

</em><br>
<p>**An awful lot of those civil liberties problems--particularly as 
<br>
regards women--are, I would say, entirely of a religious nature. 
<br>
You've got dudes patrolling the streets to make certain that women 
<br>
are not dressed improperly, in some of these nations.

</em><br>
<p>**Naaah. But the neares IL outside of it might be in the neighborhood 
<br>
of Alpha Centauri.
<br>
<p>**Hey, JOKE, okay?
<br>
<p>**Our particular brand of intelligence happens to be more geared 
<br>
toward technological innovation and advancement--which happens to 
<br>
mean we can slaughter anyone else in a fight--which, rightly or 
<br>
wrongly (and combined with a few strong cultural preferences, like 
<br>
capitalism)--means we're dominant. Doesn't mean others don't have 
<br>
things and systems of thought which are of great value and which 
<br>
would never have arisen in Western culture.
