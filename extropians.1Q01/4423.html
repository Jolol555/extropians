<p><em>&gt; Hmm, I am starting to suspect that you have not read up much about

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries are run by religious leaders rather than politicians; this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See the Islamabad Declaration on Science and Technology:

</em><br>

<em>&gt; While there is definitely inertia in adopting new technology in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islamic countries, I doubt it is because they are run by &quot;rabid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antitech nutballs&quot; - that is not a description that would fit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saudi family.  There are serious problems with civil liberties that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in my opinion the strongest reasons for technological inertia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underdevelopment, but they are not primarily of a religious nature.
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thanks, Anders, for this thoughtful and reasonable analysis. I suspect you
<br>
are correct. Here in America (at least) we tend to be bombarded with
<br>
stereotypical notions of what Islamic countries are like, mostly by a
<br>
sensation-hungry news media. This leads to a number of problems in
<br>
perception, and to an ignorance about the larger world that often leads to
<br>
further problems. Put into a proper historical perspective, we here in the
<br>
West owe a great deal to Islamic culture, and it's a shame that recent
<br>
political machinations have placed us in an adversarial position with them.
<br>
I wonder sometimes if our antipathy is simply a manifestation of a fear of
<br>
what our own future could look like . . .
