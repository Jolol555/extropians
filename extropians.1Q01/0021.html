<p><em>&gt; Same here. However, I like to think of the principles being applied at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  level of, say, a shopping mall (which would then become much more than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  shopping mall) or an industrial complex. These projects are tightly 
</em><br>
planned 
<br>
<em>&gt;  from the beginning anyhow.
</em><br>
<p>I've had the same thought for years.  Two of my earliest architectural &quot;aha&quot; 
<br>
experiences happened here in Houston, both on the same trip in 1973 or '74.  
<br>
My girlfriend (a Houstonian, who I was visiting), took me into the Hyatt 
<br>
Regency and made me not look up until I was standing in the middle (if you 
<br>
could see the way she looked, you'd understand why I was willing to do just 
<br>
about anything she asked me to do).  Then she told me to look up and I had a 
<br>
true mind-blowing experience as I took in the cavernous vertical space of the 
<br>
25(?)-story interior atrium around which the hotel is built.  I was 
<br>
speechless for a good long time.  The second was my first experience of a 
<br>
shopping mall, when we went to the Galleria the same day.
<br>
<p>Both experiences reverberated in my mind for quite some time.  I imagined 
<br>
merging the two spaces and combining living and working and retail spaces by 
<br>
gradually extending the Galleria-style multi-story mall to connect to spaces 
<br>
like the Hyatt that would be apartment buildings and also office buildings.  
<br>
I foresaw a natural, organic growth possibility for a kind of urban landscape 
<br>
that promised the efficiencies and vitality of Soleri's arcologies, but 
<br>
without the need for so much up-front planning and investment.
<br>
<p>For years I was surprised that centers like the Galleria didn't naturally 
<br>
develop along the pathway I had imagined. The benefits to all participants 
<br>
seemed like an obvious incentive to engage in that direction of development.  
<br>
I still wonder why it hasn't happened.  Partly, it's because many -- if not 
<br>
most -- people really do seem to want their own piece of dirt, no matter how 
<br>
small, and the level of privacy and the feeling of autonomy that detached 
<br>
houses provide.
<br>
<p>Another reason is the basic inertia inherent in the construction and real 
<br>
estate development industries.  Because work in those industries is so risky 
<br>
and capital intensive, development tends to stick to what's known and proven 
<br>
to work.
