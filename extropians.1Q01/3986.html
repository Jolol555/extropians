<em>&gt;Whatever happened to the ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the law to turn a blind eye to minor insults?
</em><br>
<p>They're minor insults when you get to pick and choose the situation. 
<br>
Notice that when I mentioned the scenario of having my bodyguards pie 
<br>
someone in the face, your response wasn't, &quot;Sure, that'd be fine.&quot; 
<br>
Instead, you wanted to attach a condition.  Notice that when Zeb 
<br>
mentioned a pie thrower pelting visitors at an AIDS funeral and 
<br>
throwing symbolic fetus pies at abortion recipients, your response 
<br>
was silence.
<br>
<p>I think that you're fine with pie in the face assaults on some 
<br>
people, but not on others.  That intrinsic unfairness is what sets me 
<br>
off most about your position on this issue.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Whatever happened to the ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the law to turn a blind eye to minor insults?
</em><br>
<p>One extremely desirable trait of &quot;the law&quot; is consistency, but your 
<br>
definition of &quot;minor&quot; and other terms in this discussion are so 
<br>
arbitrary that it's hard to give you a meaningful answer.  The way I 
<br>
read your question is:
<br>
<p>Whatever happened to the ability of the desirably consistent legal 
<br>
system to turn a blind eye to subjectively arbitrary insults?
<br>
<p>Error, does not parse.  Legal system goals incompatible with Stross' 
<br>
expectation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Is your society so automated and inflexible that you can't see this?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Americans are often criticized for being inflexible because we 
<br>
have rules and ethics and consider them to be important.  Heaven 
<br>
forbid that we strive to have rules that are simple to follow and 
<br>
even-handedly enforced.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
