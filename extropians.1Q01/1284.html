<p>
I have just finished reading and highly commend Richard Pipes' latest book, 
<br>
&quot;Property and Freedom&quot;.  Pipes is a leading American scholar of Russian 
<br>
history and former senior advisor to the US government on foreign policy and 
<br>
arms control and defense policy. 
<br>
<p>As the title suggests, this book looks at the relationship of two fundamental 
<br>
concepts, property and freedom.  The book is divided into five sections.  In 
<br>
the first section, Pipes considers the &quot;idea&quot; of property as developed by 
<br>
Western philosophers and social and legal theorists.  In the second, Pipes 
<br>
reviews the natural and social history of property in practice 
<br>
(&quot;institutions&quot; of property), from animal behavior through human 
<br>
developmental psychology and human anthropology and legal institutions and 
<br>
practice.  This section ends with a general overview of the institution of 
<br>
property in the West from the time of the Greeks through the Renaissance, and 
<br>
its relationship with civic life, especially the development of concepts of 
<br>
individual liberty and the relationship of individuals with larger social 
<br>
institutions.  The next two sections review in detail the political and 
<br>
social history of the relationship of property and liberty in the two 
<br>
societies with which Pipes is most familiar, Anglo-America and Russia, from 
<br>
pre-modern times through the present.  The last section discusses the 
<br>
developing relationship of the concepts of property and individual liberty in 
<br>
20th century America, and includes a good layman's discussion of the 
<br>
evolution of U.S. constitutional law as it bears on that relationship, as 
<br>
well as a review of the historical roots and over-all progress of the 
<br>
&quot;welfare state&quot; in the U.S.
<br>
<p>Pipes is not by any means a &quot;hard-core&quot; libertarian, nor is he a technical 
<br>
economic historian, but rather presents a balanced, well-informed and very 
<br>
readable overview of the interplay of the theory and practice of civil 
<br>
liberty and property rights as a social historian and a chronicler of ideas, 
<br>
rather than ideals.  I highly recommend this book as one which will provide 
<br>
an excellent historical grounding in the actual development of these vital 
<br>
streams of human history in the West.
<br>
<p>[A personal footnote on Pipes, regarding my one meeting with him - which I'm 
<br>
sure he doesn't recall.  Back in 1978 I was an undergraduate student at the 
<br>
University of Washington in Seattle, studying Chinese language and &quot;area 
<br>
studies&quot;.  At that time, Asian studies at UW were part of the &quot;Institute for 
<br>
Comparative and Foreign Area Studies (with the tongue-twisting acronym 
<br>
&quot;ICFAS&quot;).  The primary nuclei of ICFAS were the Russian and Chinese area 
<br>
studies curricula.  Thus, we &quot;China hands&quot; often sat in on talks given by 
<br>
&quot;Sovietologists&quot;.
<br>
<p>Pipes, who was already one of the giants of Russian historiography, came to 
<br>
ICFAS to speak at a seminar.  I had just read the (in)famous special issue of 
<br>
Aviation Week and Space Technology on space-based anti-missile defenses, 
<br>
which in hindsight is now seen as one of the opening shots in the &quot;Star Wars 
<br>
debate&quot;.  As I have written here before, I am an inveterate &quot;space cadet&quot;, 
<br>
and was very enthused by the ideas discussed in that piece.  After Pipes' 
<br>
talk, I was among a group of students and professors who took part in an 
<br>
informal discussion with Pipes.  I asked him whether he knew anything about 
<br>
the proposals for a space-based system that Edward Teller was pushing.  He 
<br>
hadn't heard of it and dismissed it with a brief, skeptical comment, which 
<br>
left me feeling pretty foolish.  
<br>
<p>A few years later, Pipes had become the Reagan administration's senior 
<br>
advisor on Soviet affairs and national defense policy toward the East Bloc.  
<br>
I saw a televised debate in which he took part, where he was enthusiastically 
<br>
describing and promoting the idea of space-based missile defenses.  By that 
<br>
point, I had become deeply skeptical of the plan as Teller proposed it.  I 
<br>
could only grunt in ironic satisfaction and wonder whether he remembered the 
<br>
gangly young student whom he'd dismissed as a &quot;science fiction fan&quot; . . .]
