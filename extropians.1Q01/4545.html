<p>There's a _2001_ tribute and collectibles site on the Web, &quot;Underman's _2001_&quot;
<br>
( <a href="http://www.underview.com/2001/2001.html">http://www.underview.com/2001/2001.html</a> ) that contains, on page
<br>
<a href="http://www.underview.com/2001/othreyes.html">http://www.underview.com/2001/othreyes.html</a> , a photo of the cover
<br>
of the long out-of-print _The Making of Kubrick's 2001_ by Jerome Agel
<br>
(which I owned once upon a time long ago, and just repurchased today
<br>
at an on-line used bookstore).  I had forgotten that the cover of the
<br>
Agel book shows six frames of a print of the movie, at the actual point
<br>
of transition between the bone and the satellite :-&gt;.  The page also
<br>
has a photo of the March 29, 1968 issue of _Life_ magazine, which
<br>
contained a pre-release article about the movie, with lots of color
<br>
photos, and was the first inkling I had of its existence back when
<br>
I was a high school sophomore.  Speaking of high school students --
<br>
I wonder what became of Margaret Stackhouse? :-&gt;

<p><em>&gt; &gt; That [the existence of home video] has really altered the ephemerality

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hurrah!
</em><br>
<p>Kubrick himself made a comment along these lines around the time of
<br>
_2001_, not of course in reference to home video, but in reference to the
<br>
somewhat controversial idea of movies as works of art rather than as throw-away
<br>
entertainment.  The Usenet group alt.movies.kubrick has a Web-based FAQ
<br>
at <a href="http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/kq.html">http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/kq.html</a> , which contains an answer to
<br>
the question &quot;What did Kubrick have to say about what 2001 'means'?&quot; in
<br>
the form of an excerpt from a _Playboy_ magazine interview with the director
<br>
(not there further identified, but probably it's from the September 1968 issue,
<br>
No. 177, as listed at <a href="http://www.en.com/users/wizofid/playboy/interview.html">http://www.en.com/users/wizofid/playboy/interview.html</a> ).
<br>
He remarks:
<br>
<p>&quot;The whole idea that a movie should be seen only once is an extension of
<br>
our traditional conception of the film as an ephemeral entertainment rather
<br>
than as a visual work of art. We don't believe that we should hear a great
<br>
piece of music only once, or see a great painting once, or even read a great
<br>
book just once. But the film has until recent years been exempted from the
<br>
category of art -- a situation I'm glad is finally changing.
