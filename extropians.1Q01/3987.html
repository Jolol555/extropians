<p><em>&gt; So let me ask your rhetorical question back at you.  Why do capitalists
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; have never been able to show even one success after all these years?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just curious.  Hal
</em><br>
<p>As much as I hate to wade into this morass, I would suggest the
<br>
reason capitalists disdain commies is because of the horrifying
<br>
destruction of society that comes along with every communist
<br>
revolution.  Some are worse than others, of course.  The world
<br>
is watching a soft destruction going on in Hong Kong, as opposed
<br>
to the violent course of Cuba, Russia, China, etc.  In those three cases,
<br>
woe indeed to anyone who owned anything, for the bourgeois
<br>
were often slain or tortured for their crime of owning more than
<br>
they needed to survive when the commies came to steal their gross
<br>
excess.
<br>
<p>Those of us who lived when the USSR was a powerful force in
<br>
the world lived with the notion (which I still believe) that communism
<br>
cannot prosper long term alongside capitalism.  The capitalist
<br>
side will always prosper whereas the commie side will be poor,
<br>
leading to the young commies to yearn for what the capitalists have,
<br>
leading to dissatisfaction.  Therefor, the entire world must be commie,
<br>
or else communism dies.  That is pretty much what happened in
<br>
the last century, eh?
<br>
<p>Nowthen, I seldom get worked up as you know, but for this I
<br>
take a stand: the multistage battle that is coming to be known as
<br>
world war 3, the fight against communism and its ultimate
<br>
destruction is a cause that was *worth* every drop of blood that
<br>
was shed, which were tragically many.  To this day, freedom loving
<br>
people, perhaps *especially* extropians, must remember the
<br>
sacrifices that were made and the lives lost to defeat this loathsome
<br>
curse on humankind.  May it never return.  May humanity never
<br>
again suffer the bitterness of communism, nazism, fascism, EVER.
<br>
<p>Find a Vietnam vet, shake his hand, buy him lunch, tell him you
<br>
appreciate his sacrifice.  spike
