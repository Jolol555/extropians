Well, I didn't really want to get deeper into this, but, what the hell, its
<br>
generating a lot of press...
<br>
<p><p>I wasn't particularly impressed with the so-called 'correct' answer to this
<br>
riddle and I guess I might as well say why:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Lateral%20Thinking&In-Reply-To=&lt;004f01c0755c$c0dfb020$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; I am two boxes, each inside the other;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The answer containing the riddle, the riddle containing the answer.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so we're using 'box' as a metaphor for... both the riddle and the
<br>
answer to the riddle.  Not only do I find 'box' a poor metaphor for a
<br>
meta-riddle, but also we aren't really talking about things being inside one
<br>
another, but rather one thing referencing itself.
<br>
<p>I'm sorry, but, folks, this is -thin.-
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; I am myself, I have no brother;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The two are one.
</em><br>
<p>That's not what this line says.  Rather, it indicates that the system has no
<br>
sibling.  Not sure what this adds other than to provide a rhyme for &quot;other.&quot;
<br>
<p>Think about it-- you could easily have said: &quot;I am myself and I have a
<br>
brother.&quot; and been just as accurate.  (Another metaphor for the second box.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; I am exactly what I claim;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The substance of its own text.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, you're not exactly what you claim.  You 'claim' to be two boxes,
<br>
but we know instead that you are not, you are, rather, one riddle.  (If a
<br>
metaphor was the real thing, it wouldn't be a metaphor.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; If you guess this riddle, speak my name.
</em><br>
<p>If you wanted this line to work, you should have named your riddle.  Even
<br>
just calling it &quot;Eliezer's Riddle&quot; would have worked.  Instead, the reader
<br>
is left with a conundrum: the riddle has no name, so an external title must
<br>
be created.  However, for reasons of which, I'm sure you're aware, you're
<br>
not really allowed to refer to (answer) this riddle with a title that is not
<br>
contained within it.  Instead, we simply can't name it, we must, instead,
<br>
describe it.
<br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><p><p>I don't mind clever bootstraps-- you might be aware, for instance, of a cute
<br>
little philosophy primer by the name of:
<br>
<p>There Are Two Errors in the
<br>
the Title of This Book.
<br>
<p><p>...who's premise operates under a similar self-referential paradox.  But
<br>
here the concept is clear and un-dilluted, it does not operate under
<br>
metaphor, it IS, itself, the second error, we do not need to introduce the
<br>
concepts of boxes and brothers.
<br>
<p>An issue with this riddle being its own answer is that you could really give
<br>
this same answer for almost all riddles... it's a cop out:
<br>
<p>&quot;What is 1+1?&quot;   Well, 1+1 of course!
<br>
<p>&quot;I am a big tree, only taller.  What am I?&quot;   Well, a big tree, only taller
<br>
of course!
<br>
<p><p><p>I'm not sure what weaknesses Damien Broderick perceived in my answer (I hope
<br>
he'll point them out!) but let me show why I like it so much better (besides
<br>
my obvious prejudice.)
<br>
<p>Answer: &quot;Voice Box&quot; (spoken)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I am two boxes, each inside the other;
</em><br>
<p>The sound contains the object and the object contains the sound.  Also, they
<br>
both happen to actually be 'boxes.'
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am myself, I have no brother;
</em><br>
<p>I sort of considered this line to be fluff (as mentioned above) although I
<br>
suppose the existence of more than one instance of someone speaking the word
<br>
&quot;Voice Box&quot; might mean my answer has a brother...?  Actually, no, all spoken
<br>
responses refer to the same answer-- I am not referencing a particular
<br>
object or instance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am exactly what I claim;
</em><br>
<p>True.  We are now actually referring to boxes, and not using the word in a
<br>
metaphorical sense.  Metaphors work great in riddles, but if you want to use
<br>
them, you probably shouldn't include statements of precision as per the
<br>
above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you guess this riddle, speak my name.
</em><br>
<p>The answer has a name, in this case &quot;Voice Box,&quot; and further, it must be
<br>
spoken to be correct.
