<p><em>&gt; &quot;Scalable Routing Design Principles&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I still think that by making locally-connected networks
<br>
with nodes aware of their geographical position the best
<br>
solution is geodetic routing. Imagine the planet covered
<br>
with a slab of space containing static or mobile routers
<br>
of (time-/space-) varying density, which route via a kind 
<br>
of 3d-Bresenham (actually, its higher-dimensional homologue, 
<br>
since each node sees more others than the nodes on a 3d 
<br>
lattice). To allow cut-through, you have to be able to 
<br>
decide which space cone to choose to repeat to, 
<br>
while the packet header is still streaming past you 
<br>
(very short FIFO, if any), so the packet coding should 
<br>
be appropriate. Of course, you should allow store-and-forward 
<br>
as well, as otherwise too many packets get dropped if packet 
<br>
concentration/space volume spikes too high.
<br>
<p>For this to work, the node connectivity has roughly to 
<br>
approximate the geographic proximity relationship. If 
<br>
we do node-mutual time of flight &quot;triangulation&quot; 
<br>
(scare-crowed since providing not angle but distance 
<br>
constraints), the nodes can act as a global positioning 
<br>
system as well as a nuke-quality time standard (if
<br>
you see a lot of high-resolution clocks, you average out
<br>
the drift). Best way to implement this would be obviously 
<br>
by using forthcoming digital pulse radio, which is very 
<br>
good for high-precision realtime positioning service as 
<br>
well as offering excellent utilization of bandwidth, plus 
<br>
compatibility with existing spectrum allocation (digital 
<br>
pulse radio ultrabroadband looks a lot like white noise 
<br>
background of relatively low intensity, so it doesn't jam
<br>
but degrades).
<br>
<p>This is especially suitable to a cloud of LEO satellites
<br>
(or a large number of stratospheric platforms) with 
<br>
line-of-sight laser and wireless (constant average
<br>
density of mobile nodes), as well as cellular packet 
<br>
switched networks (static nodes, highest density in 
<br>
urban areas). But you should be able to use TOF measurements 
<br>
on legacy copper and fiber, too.
<br>
<p>But wireless and LoS laser will get there first, obviously.
<br>
A from scratch global network doesn't have to deal with legacy
<br>
nor (overhead-riddled) packet accounting with other networks. 
<br>
It could wrap legacy protocols, so both would coexist on the 
<br>
same infrastructure, slowly phasing out legacy stuff as TCP/IP.
