</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your rationale is quite convincing. I would tend to agree with you, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little restraints, on the arguments you delivered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, there is still the argument of people dying and of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have been to America, and we basically agree on the same thing: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living environment in the US of A is definitely not friendly. It's a country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more rough than we have here, and everything I've seen, read and heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agrees with that. I would guess that attitudes like yours help significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in reinforcing the non-friendliness and coldness of your society. I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to make a strong point of this: I definitely think that a widespread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence of individualist, society-fearing attitudes continuously reinforces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a society that is indeed to be feared.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, would you care to make the argument instead of simply asserting it
<br>
exists?  That some people agree with you does not make the argument very
<br>
well. I know quite a few people who own guns.  They are not one whit
<br>
less friendly than the people I know that do not.  One difference I do
<br>
notice is that the gun-owners I know tend to be a bit more serious
<br>
minded and responsible over all.  Knowing that one can deliver deadly
<br>
force if necessary and being willing to protect those oneself and those
<br>
one is with tends to change a person to a bit more sober and responsible
<br>
an attitude.  But they are hardly cold.  If anything they have more
<br>
mutual trust and respect.  
<br>
<p>You are making a &quot;strong point&quot; based on anecdotes and supposition.  I
<br>
am giving counter-anecdotes.  Society is nothing but a collection of
<br>
individuals. To the the extent that the society enables the flourishing
<br>
of the individuals within it it is good.  To the extent it doesn't it is
<br>
less good.  But to elevate the society above the individual as some
<br>
higher type of entity is fundamentally flawed and has led quite
<br>
literally to the deaths of many 10s of millions worldwide.  Only those
<br>
who would violate the rights of individuals by the initiation of force
<br>
have any reason to fear.  The rest can rest secure in the knowledge they
<br>
are not without some defense of their own and that others are able and
<br>
willing to stand for them.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the end, it all comes to a tradeoff: quality of living (of which I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite convinced you have less than we do) versus the ability to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oneself. As appealing as your arguments may be, I still think the ability of
</em><br>
<p>There are no statistics or a very strong argument that you have given to
<br>
justify this assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; defending oneself with firearms is not as important as you may think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Despite of our much-alluded-to history lessons, we decided to opt for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality of living instead. You, on the other hand, continuously decide for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ability to defend yourself. That's fine with me, but I don't think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a smart choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is pretty weak.  Do you really think there is a direct strong cause
<br>
and effect between having no right ot have guns and improved quality of
<br>
life?  On what basis?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At the bottom line, you're a bunch of scared people. You seem to think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicts matter; I think they don't. You seem to think that who wins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters; I don't. And most of all, you probably don't see how this attitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of yours reinforces a cold, adversary society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>In a choice of life or death, who wins matters a lot.  In a choice of
<br>
being free or enslaved or easy to enslave, it matters a lot where one is
<br>
on the spectrum.  What cold society are you referring to?  I have been
<br>
to a few parts of Europe myself and I didn't notice any greater warmth
<br>
than in the US. I did notice that a lot of people seem to have an inbred
<br>
attitude that the state is more important than they are that is
<br>
relatively absent in the US.  Many European cultures actually struck me
<br>
as more xenophobic than America and the attitude of people on the
<br>
streets felt if anything less friendly and open.  But again, these are
<br>
merely experiential anecdotes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think your attitude is the original reason why you have a police you need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be afraid of; not the reverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think you are making a lot of meaningless assertions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; And if in the end we still disagree then come around yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; and try to take my guns away.  Don't send some poor underpaid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; flatfoot to do it for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I apologize if this is what my original message looked like. Under no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances would I try to push a ban on anything where a non-trivial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of people disagrees with it. It's a decision a society has to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a vast majority of votes, and I don't see you making that decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anytime soon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How is the majority of people deciding to overright the minority
<br>
automatically right or any better than you coming into my home by force
<br>
and attempting to take away my guns or any other part of my property
<br>
against my wishes.  If I have a fundamental right to self-defense then
<br>
how is a majority denying that right any more acceptable than a
<br>
minority?  If the majority decide to decimate an entire people or class
<br>
of people (which has happened many times in history) is it OK because
<br>
they are the majority?  How so?  We know for a fact that it is usually
<br>
the minority who bring innovation and clearer thinking.  If that
<br>
minority is defenseless to whatever the majority can be swung to then
<br>
how is that a better of more warm and friendly society? If anything I
<br>
would be much more afraid that at any moment the majority could be swung
<br>
against me.  I would much more fear my fellow-humans in such a
<br>
situation.
