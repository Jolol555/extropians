<p><em>&gt; I think you misread the article; the growth was from mid 1999 to the

</em><br>
<p>Yes, you're right--thanks for pointing that out.  Sorry for the error.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We had some discussion here last year about online &quot;virtual stock&quot;games like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; StockGeneration.  Most of these are Ponzi schemes and fail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually, leaving a lot of unhappy &quot;investors&quot;.  Several of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies were using e-gold as their payment service because it did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the provision for customers to contest payments as they can with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credit cards.  I had the impression that a substantial part of e-gold's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth in early 2000 was due to these games, but I haven't been following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it lately.
</em><br>
<p>That seems like a plausible explanation for the growth rate.  Which is
<br>
unfortunate, because it gives regulators an excuse to go after e-gold.com, to
<br>
&quot;protect&quot; the Ponzi victims.  However, such marginal &quot;businesses&quot; (Ponzi schemes,
<br>
gambling, porn) seem to be quite helpful in initially overcoming the chicken/egg
<br>
problems that often plague new technologies like this--e.g. no customer wants to
<br>
go to the trouble to sign up to use e-gold unless many online businesses accept
<br>
e-gold payments and vice versa.   Lust and greed often seem to be required to
<br>
overcome the inertia of the status quo.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, a nice summary of the history of the original Ponzi scheme is
<br>
