<p>I dont expect the little ones are as bright, and I do not expect
<br>
tiny people to be as smart as full sized ones, however consider
<br>
this curious twist:  the first Mars colonists would live in a post-
<br>
singularity world, in a sense.  They would depend on machines
<br>
to make the decisions, to help them think.  They would live in
<br>
a world in which machines are smarter than they are.
<br>
<p>We can already see limited cases in which humans have at
<br>
least temporary post-singlarity existence (again, in a sense).
<br>
The F18 has experimental ACFIT software (anti-controlled
<br>
flight into terrain).  If the pilot is heading for the ground, the
<br>
ACFIT assumes he is dead, injured, or crazy, takes over
<br>
the controls and avoids the turf.  Then if the pilot doesnt
<br>
start giving commands that make sense, the ACFIT will
<br>
actually ignore him and fly home.  The future JSF (Joint
<br>
Strike Fighter) will have extensive ACFIT as well as
<br>
software that will take over the controls when the plane
<br>
has been fired upon, in order to decide upon an optimal
<br>
strategy then attempt an evasive maneuver to avoid an
<br>
incoming missile.
<br>
<p>In the time it would take to train a Martian colonist, I
<br>
think we could write the software to take many of those
<br>
tasks that require high intelligence out of her hands.  This
<br>
has some enormous advantages.  If we manage to find
<br>
the genetic switch that would allow us to produce a tiny
<br>
person, good chance is that she might be mentally average
<br>
or below.  But she could carry frozen embryos that are
<br>
almost sure to be way above average.  If the machines
<br>
can carry the load in the area of judgement for one
<br>
generation, then intelligence could be bootstrapped upwards.
<br>
In a sense then, the Mars colonists would be kinda sorta
<br>
living post singularity (lower case s).
<br>
<p>Eager to hear Eliezer's comments on this.
