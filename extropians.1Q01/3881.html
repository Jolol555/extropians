<p>I believe that  James Kent's program made it possible to assemble the
<br>
disparate gene sequences that had been mapped by the members of the
<br>
consortium.  It appears that Kent performed the first assembly 3 days
<br>
prior to the date Celera claims to have completed assembly.  This
<br>
allowed  Collins to claim that the tax-supported effort had created a
<br>
complete, if rough, map at the joint announcement he and Ventera made
<br>
early in 2000.  From the article:
<br>
<p>&quot;Mr. Kent performed his first
<br>
assembly on the human genome on
<br>
June 22, just four days before Dr.
<br>
Francis S. Collins, the consortium's
<br>
informal leader, and Dr. J. Craig
<br>
Venter of Celera, announced at the
<br>
White House on June 26 that each
<br>
had assembled the human genome.
<br>
<p><p>Since Dr. Venter has now stated that
<br>
Celera finished its computer assembly
<br>
just the day before, on the night of
<br>
June 25, it turns out that Mr. Kent's
<br>
brilliant improvisation was the first
<br>
assembly of the human genome, even
<br>
though one that had and still contains
<br>
many gaps.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, Celera's map may be of higher quality--I don't know.

<p><p>As a somewhat relevant aside,  I used to think that patents and
<br>
copyright were consistent with a libertarian
<br>
political stance.  Now, after reading some of the articles below, I'm
<br>
less sure.

<p>THE CASE AGAINST THE PATENT SYSTEM

<br>
<p>&quot;As many psychologists and historians of technology have shown,
<br>
innovation does not proceed through major breakthroughs by specific
<br>
individuals, but rather through the collaboration of different people
<br>
who, through small and cumulative improvements, yield novel and useful
<br>
artifacts over time (Basalla, 1988). All of patent law, on the other
<br>
hand, is based on the assumption that an invention is a discrete and
<br>
novel entity that can be assigned to the individual who is determined by
<br>
<p>the courts to be its legitimate creator. The associations of an
<br>
invention with other existing or past artifacts are therefore obscured.
<br>
Despite its philosophical foundation, however, the patent system cannot
<br>
entirely obscure the true nature of technological change. As I have
<br>
already mentioned, virtually every new patent infringes in some way on
<br>
other patents. Furthermore, most patented innovation are typically very
<br>
minor improvements. As the economist F.M. Scherer (1987: 124) has noted:
<br>
<p>« As the bleary-eyed reviewer of some 15,000 patent abstracts in
<br>
connection with research? I was struck by how narrowly incremental
<br>
(adaptive?) most &quot;inventions&quot; are. » Even an anonymous author writing in
<br>
<p>a brochure of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (1994: 8) had to
<br>
<p>admit that 90% of all patented inventions are minor improvements on
<br>
existing patented devices.&quot;

<br>
<p>Very good history of IP laws in the U.S. by Harvard Law professor, that
<br>
is generally sympathetic to reducing their scope.
<br>
It contains this astonishing quote:
<br>
<p>&quot;Last year, a group of intellectual-property lawyers argued in an
<br>
article in the National Law Journal that athletic maneuvers could and
<br>
should be patented. A method &quot;for sailing an America's Cup yacht wherein
<br>
<p>the yacht sails 10 degrees closer to the wind, for
<br>
high-jumping higher or for skiing downhill 10 percent faster,' they
<br>
claimed, could easily be classified as a &quot;useful process&quot; within the
<br>
meaning of the federal patent statute. If nonobvious and novel, such a
<br>
technique should qualify for patent protection. After all, if one
<br>
can patent a new surgical procedure, why not the Fosbery Flop? n2 The
<br>
chances that the courts would adopt this proposal are not
<br>
great, but the argument is colorable.&quot;
