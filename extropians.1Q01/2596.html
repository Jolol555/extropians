<em>&gt;Think of all of the ideas that Jobs helped to drive forward, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desktop publishing, affordable laser printing, and GUIs. USB was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology that Intel had been pitching for *years* to PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manufacturers, but that had never caught on. In one sweep, Jobs put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;USB as the main interface on all new Macs, and the entire computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;industry quickly followed. USB is a good thing.
</em><br>
<p>USB had a quiet start, but it was beginning to take off.  Intel were 
<br>
building boards with it on-board for several years.  The port was there, 
<br>
peripheral manufacturers were just dragging their heels.
<br>
<p>USB is good.  It's good because you don't have to pay Intel squat to build 
<br>
it into your PC.  If Apple had invented USB, they'd be charging 50cents or 
<br>
more per port like they do with IEEE1394, and it would be about as popular 
<br>
as that standard is now on PCs ie. it's not.  So much for driving innovation...
<br>
<p>Anyone I've ever met was introduced to GUIs through a much underpraised 
<br>
machine called the Amiga or it's rival, the Atari ST(E).  Mac-style GUI for 
<br>
the home at a non-insane price (Macs retailed here for 4-5K, PCs for 2-3, 
<br>
and the Amiga and Atari ST for around 600 quid).  The only people who owned 
<br>
Macs here were Apple employees, who got them for free or businessmen who 
<br>
probably couldn't use them but thought they looked &quot;stylish&quot;.  Schools 
<br>
bought a couple and used them for all of 5 minutes before jamming open 
<br>
doors with them and buying loads of cheap BBC micros or Amstrad 1512/1640s.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;An alternative world that had never had Steve Jobs would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contained a PC industry 10 or 20 years behind the one that we live in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now. No thanks.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps in the U.S. it was different, but over here, Apple could have never 
<br>
existed and I doubt we'd have noticed.
<br>
<p>While Apple was in limbo with the Power PC, The IBM PC was busy working 
<br>
through various generations of processor and bus I/O architecture, as well 
<br>
as cheaper and cheaper high resolution, high colour video systems.
<br>
<p>Microsoft bloatware has done more to push hardware design in the PC world 
<br>
than any influence by Apple.  The encroachment of the 16 bit machines of 
<br>
the mid to late 80's in terms of power and capabilities had it's effect also.
<br>
<p>Slan,
<br>
<p><p><p>James...
<br>
<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
