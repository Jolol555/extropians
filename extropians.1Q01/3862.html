Business analysists distinguish between vertical and horizontal market
<br>
segments.  A business with vertical integration attempts to capture
<br>
a wide range of products and services for a particular target market.
<br>
For example, a business may supply farmers with equipment and seeds and
<br>
feed.  Horizontal integration would then be an attempt to capture a wide
<br>
range of markets with a specific and relatively narrow set of products.
<br>
<p>The US government was founded on a principle of separation of powers.
<br>
This can be thought of as providing vertical integration with horizontal
<br>
separation.  The executive branch provides all aspects of law execution
<br>
and enforcement, from the Park Service police, to the military, to
<br>
the FCC.  The judiciary includes a range of federal courts, and the
<br>
legislature has its own extensive staff and offices to create new laws.
<br>
<p>The idea is that although there is vertical integration, horizontal
<br>
competition between the branches will occur.  No one branch can become
<br>
dominant and so government power is restrained.
<br>
<p>A weakness with this model is that there is a limit to the amount of
<br>
separation and competition possible.  There just aren't that many distinct
<br>
vertical market segments into which we can divide government functions.
<br>
<p>We occasionally discuss a different concept for dividing the government
<br>
to reduce its power, sometimes called &quot;Privately Produced Law&quot; or PPL.
<br>
Bruce Benson (in The Enterprise of Law) and David Friedman (in The
<br>
Machinery of Freedom) are two authors who have explored this possibility
<br>
in detail.  It can be thought of as a form of horizontal segmentation of
<br>
government.  Instead of one police force, there would be many; instead
<br>
of one legislature, there would be multiple ones, each creating their
<br>
own constellation of laws.
<br>
<p>Of course such segmentation already exists in the world, but strictly
<br>
along geographic lines.  The idea explored by these authors is to
<br>
allow competition to exist within a geographic region among multiple
<br>
governments.  Each person could choose which government's laws to follow,
<br>
they would pay whatever taxes that government specified, and they would
<br>
then receive whatever protection it was able and willing to provide.
<br>
<p>With horizontal segmentation, we could safely allow vertical integration.
<br>
There would no longer be a need for a government to have independent
<br>
legislature, executive and judiciary.  If various governments compete
<br>
for citizens, they may choose to organize themselves internally in any
<br>
way they desire.  Efficiency, rather than limitation of power, would be
<br>
the guiding principle.
