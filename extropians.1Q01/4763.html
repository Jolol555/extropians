<p>Claude Shannon, Mathematician, Dies at 84
<br>
<p><p>By GEORGE JOHNSON
<br>
<p><p>Dr. Claude Elwood Shannon, the American mathematician and computer
<br>
scientist whose theories laid the groundwork for the electronic
<br>
communications networks that now lace the earth, died on Saturday in
<br>
Medford, Mass., after a long fight with Alzheimer's disease. He was 84.
<br>
<p>Understanding, before almost anyone, the power that springs from
<br>
encoding
<br>
information in a simple language of 1's and 0's, Dr. Shannon as a young
<br>
man
<br>
wrote two papers that remain monuments in the fields of computer science
<br>
and information theory.
<br>
<p>&quot;Shannon was the person who saw that the binary digit was the
<br>
fundamental
<br>
element in all of communication,&quot; said Dr. Robert G. Gallager, a
<br>
professor
<br>
of electrical engineering who worked with Dr. Shannon at the
<br>
Massachusetts
<br>
Institute of Technology. &quot;That was really his discovery, and from it the
<br>
whole communications revolution has sprung.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Shannon's later work on chess- playing machines and an electronic
<br>
mouse
<br>
that could run a maze helped create the field of artificial
<br>
intelligence,
<br>
the effort to make machines that think. And his ability to combine
<br>
abstract
<br>
thinking with a practical approach - he had a penchant for building
<br>
machines - inspired a generation of computer scientists.
<br>
<p>&lt;...snippage...&gt;
<br>
<p>In 1948, Dr. Shannon published his masterpiece, &quot;A Mathematical Theory
<br>
of
<br>
Communication,&quot; giving birth to the science called information theory.
<br>
The
<br>
motivation again was practical: how to transmit messages while keeping
<br>
them
<br>
from becoming garbled by noise.
<br>
<p>To analyze this problem properly, he realized, he had to come up with a
<br>
precise definition of information, a dauntingly slippery concept. The
<br>
information content of a message, he proposed, has nothing to do with
<br>
its
<br>
content but simply with the number of 1's and 0's that it takes to
<br>
transmit
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>This was a jarring notion to a generation of engineers who were
<br>
accustomed
<br>
to thinking of communication in terms of sending electromagnetic
<br>
waveforms
<br>
down a wire. &quot;Nobody had come close to this idea before,&quot; Dr. Gallager
<br>
said. &quot;This was not something somebody else would have done for a very
<br>
long
<br>
time.&quot;
<br>
<p>The overarching lesson was that the nature of the message did not matter
<br>
-
<br>
it could be numbers, words, music, video. Ultimately it was all just 1's
<br>
and 0's.
<br>
<p>Today, when gigabytes of movie trailers, Napster files and e-mail
<br>
messages
<br>
course through the same wires as telephone calls, the idea seems almost
<br>
elemental. But it has its roots in Dr. Shannon's paper, which may
<br>
contain
<br>
the first published occurrence of the word &quot;bit.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Shannon also showed that if enough extra bits were added to a
<br>
message,
<br>
to help correct for errors, it could tunnel through the noisiest
<br>
channel,
<br>
arriving unscathed at the end. This insight has been developed over the
<br>
decades into sophisticated error-correction codes that ensure the
<br>
integrity
<br>
of the data on which society interacts.
<br>
<p>In later years, his ideas spread beyond the fields of communications
<br>
engineering and computer science, taking root in cryptography, the
<br>
mathematics of probability and even investment theory. In biology, it
<br>
has
<br>
become second nature to think of DNA replication and hormonal signaling
<br>
in
<br>
terms of information.
<br>
<p>And more than one English graduate student has written papers trying to
<br>
apply information theory to literature - the kind of phenomenon that
<br>
later
<br>
caused Dr. Shannon to complain of what he called a &quot;bandwagon effect.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Information theory has perhaps ballooned to an importance beyond its
<br>
actual accomplishments,&quot; he lamented.
<br>
<p>After he moved to M.I.T. in 1958, and beyond his retirement two decades
<br>
later, he pursued a diversity of interests - a mathematical theory of
<br>
juggling, an analog computer programmed to beat roulette, a system for
<br>
playing the stock market using probability theory.
<br>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Moore Shannon; a son, Andrew
<br>
Moore Shannon; a daughter, Margarita Shannon; a sister, Catherine S.
<br>
Kay;
<br>
and two granddaughters.
<br>
<p>In the last years of his life, Alzheimer's disease began to set in.
<br>
&quot;Something inside him was getting lost,&quot; Dr. Minsky said. &quot;Yet none of
<br>
us
<br>
miss him the way you'd expect - for the image of that great stream of
<br>
ideas
<br>
still persists in everyone his mind ever touched.&quot;
