Subject: OWL: &quot;Why Have Children?&quot;
<br>
<p>WHY HAVE CHILDREN?  -  AN OBJECTIVIST APPROACH
<br>
<p>Today, with almost fool-proof birth control, legal abortions and the
<br>
future prospects of self-cloning, the question &quot;Why Have Children?&quot; may
<br>
sound similar to a question often heard among non Orthodox Jews: &quot;Why be
<br>
Jewish?&quot;
<br>
<p>And indeed, why undertake an eighteen-year obligation to raise and
<br>
support a completely dependent human being?  Why assume the legal and
<br>
moral responsibility for the conduct of someone else?  Why would any
<br>
rational, independent, self-respecting individual want to do that?
<br>
<p>The common rationale for having children among Objectivists is that it
<br>
is their selfish wish: they enjoy the nurturing.  But can this selfish
<br>
wish be justified philosophically?  Nurturing is not an Objectivist
<br>
virtue.  It cannot be reconciled with the serene self-sufficiency of
<br>
Rand's heroes.  However, Objectivism strives to provide men and women
<br>
with a philosophy that can fit their nature, which does not require any
<br>
sacrifices.  In this context, the best justification for having children
<br>
is that parenting is a part of human nature, just like a romantic
<br>
relationship.  According to this view, the commitment to raise a child
<br>
is no different from the commitment to stay in a life-long monogamous
<br>
relationship, &quot;for better or worse.&quot;  If an Objectivist were to say that
<br>
having a romantic relationship takes away from his or her time pursuing
<br>
a career, it would be considered odd.  Then why isn't it considered odd
<br>
when the same claim is made against parenting?
<br>
<p>People who do not want children should not be pressed to have them -
<br>
just like those who do not want a romantic relationship should not be
<br>
pressed to have one.  But they should make sure their choice is not
<br>
influenced by the traditional self-sacrificial view of parenthood.
<br>
According to this traditional view, nurturing is indeed not a part of
<br>
human nature.  Men and women are selfish hedonists by nature and raising
<br>
children is a selfless duty.
<br>
<p>This view is similar to the view of work as a task that must be
<br>
performed in order to make a living.  The same mentality that regards
<br>
work as an endless sequence of five days of toil relieved by two days of
<br>
rest until the blissful retirement, also regards children as an eighteen
<br>
year
<br>
sentence relieved by sleep away trips until the blissful days of the
<br>
empty nest.  As the saying goes: &quot;Life does not begin at conception or
<br>
at birth.  It begins when the last kid leaves home and the dog dies.&quot;
<br>
According to this view, the only thing a working person can enjoy is a
<br>
TGIF party and the only thing parents can enjoy is a weekend escape for
<br>
two.
<br>
<p>I would like to point out that both work and children were part of the
<br>
Biblical curse inflicted on Adam and Eve when they were driven out of
<br>
the Garden of Eden.  In the Garden of Eden man did not have to work and
<br>
woman did not have to bear children.  Adam and Eve were a childless
<br>
couple doing nothing.  Only when they ate from the tree of knowledge
<br>
they were cursed with work and children.  One of the greatest
<br>
innovations of Objectivism is its positive view of work as a purposeful,
<br>
enjoyable task and the proper function of man.  Unfortunately, when it
<br>
comes to the issue of children, Objectivists tend to join the
<br>
conventional view of children as drudgery.  Refusing to have children
<br>
because it is a selfless duty plays into the hands of those who claim
<br>
that such is the nature of parenthood.
<br>
<p>In her essay &quot;The Shame of Not Wanting Children&quot;, Carolyn Ray writes:
<br>
&quot;Judging by the way many parents behave toward children, and by the
<br>
things they complain about, it seems pretty clear that most people don't
<br>
like children very much at all.  They are bothered by a high percentage
<br>
of the natural behavior of healthy children.&quot;  I think that these
<br>
parents are not necessarily those who should not have had children in
<br>
the first place, but those who never learned to enjoy their children.
<br>
They bought into the theory that children are a chore and did not give
<br>
their children a chance to prove otherwise.
<br>
<p>Parenting requires some concessions, but so do work and marriage.
<br>
Career minded individuals are willing to put up with the demands and
<br>
conduct of superiors and co-employees at work, for longer hours than
<br>
they would ever spend with their kids.  Married or committed people are
<br>
willing to work out their differences in order to preserve their
<br>
relationship.  Children are not necessarily the worst irrational whim
<br>
worshippers one must deal with.  In many cases, they are the only
<br>
uncorrupted, reasonable human beings around.  In this context, it would
<br>
be a selfless sacrifice to give up the benefit of having kids in order
<br>
to devote oneself to one's career.
<br>
<p>A major aspect of having children that is rarely addressed by
<br>
Objectivists is that children are the future: they will be here when we
<br>
are gone.  They will carry on our genetic makeup, as well as our values,
<br>
if we are good parents.  An intriguing portrayal of a childless society
<br>
is provided in &quot;The Children of Earth,&quot; a science fiction novel by
<br>
British author P.D. James.  Due to a mysterious epidemic, all the women
<br>
on Earth become infertile.  The impact on civilization is devastating.
<br>
Rather than celebrate their newly found freedom from children and devote
<br>
all their time and energy to production and creativity, people are
<br>
paralyzed.  Knowing that they are the last of their species and that
<br>
Homo Sapiens will become extinct is one generation, most people decide
<br>
it is pointless to create anything.  Why write a novel nobody will be
<br>
around to read in one generation? Why build a house nobody will be
<br>
around to live in after one's death?  People become hedonists, with
<br>
short-range goals that keep getting shorter.  Wouldn't it be sad indeed
<br>
if Rand's generation was the last generation of Homo Sapiens on earth
<br>
and we were not around to read her novels?
