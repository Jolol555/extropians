</em><br>
<p><p>I should mention that I don't want to sound like an Oracle cheerleader, 
<br>
because I am not.  In fact, I have had a lot of reservations about certain 
<br>
features (or lack thereof) in Oracle for some time.  Fortunately, the 
<br>
recent incarnation of Oracle (8i) is substantially better than previous 
<br>
versions in many important aspects, including most of the areas I had 
<br>
reservations in, so it is much easier for me to like it today than it was 
<br>
five years ago when obviously superior alternative products existed.  While 
<br>
I have used Oracle a lot over the past five years or so, I have worked on a 
<br>
lot of other things as well; virtually every company I've worked in uses 
<br>
Oracle to some extent or another and knowing how to work with Oracle 
<br>
systems in detail is a useful skill.
<br>
<p>In truth, I would be just as happy or happier if I never had to work with 
<br>
Oracle, it just so happens that I frequently do.  It isn't THE core 
<br>
competency for me, it is just one of the many things I am very competent 
<br>
at, and once you know it, it takes very little effort to stay current with 
<br>
it.  I work on enough different projects that I am constantly exposed to it 
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I have made a quite comfortable living writing OO persistence middleware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to alleviate having to depend on an particular flavor or vendor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;database.  Business types certainly do care when they need to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;various types of database solution over time on heterogeneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;platforms.
</em><br>
<p><p>One of the strong selling points of Oracle is that it runs on a few dozen 
<br>
platforms and that applications are seamlessly portable between them.  This 
<br>
is one of its strengths, and I have used Oracle in heavily mixed 
<br>
shops.  Having done these types of ports (usually NT to Unix or mainframe), 
<br>
I can say that it really is a trivial platform to do migrations on for the 
<br>
most part.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Many real-world business people do not want to be married to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oracle or any other single vendor.  More than a few of them have tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make that relationship work for them and have decided to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something different.
</em><br>
<p><p>Most real-world business people like the warm-fuzzy feeling they get from 
<br>
hearing words like &quot;Oracle&quot; or &quot;Cisco&quot; or &quot;Microsoft&quot; or &quot;IBM&quot;.  In many 
<br>
ways it is a deal with the devil, though.  Non-corporate solutions have to 
<br>
move much more slowly to get management mind share, something that there 
<br>
isn't time for over the span of relatively short contracts.  For many 
<br>
companies, a small open solution holds far more risk than a well-known 
<br>
proprietary solution, particularly for complex software.  Most of the 
<br>
long-term problems I've seen for complex applications has more to do with 
<br>
the number of people who understand the application code rather than the 
<br>
support of the platform that the application runs on.  Once something 
<br>
works, it doesn't really matter where the solution came from.
<br>
<p>Every business should pick and choose the components of their system; 
<br>
interoperability between components is what is important.  Oracle 
<br>
interoperates pretty well, and when it is my decision, the only Oracle 
<br>
application that I actually use is the core engine.  All the surrounding 
<br>
applications are typically the usual open source tools -- I know them well 
<br>
and they work great.  When an open source database exists that is truly 
<br>
comparable to Oracle, then I will consider that as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;PL/SQL is not a 4GL.
</em><br>
<p><p>Granted, but like many companies, they like to think that it is.  I was 
<br>
using it in the sense of common usage, not by definition (a bad thing perhaps).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;De-facto standards are meant to be toppled and should be as soon as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get lazy.  The argument from the other side is quite strong.  Standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solutions in a world that re-invents itself every other Monday are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't follow.  So you are arguing against standards?  How would this 
<br>
decrease the risk to the company?
