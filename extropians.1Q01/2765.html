<p><p><em>&gt; Actually, the question here is this:  What is the purpose of prison,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway?  Most everyone who's been through a civis or government class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encouners this question at least at some level.  While I think we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all agree that prison is a deterrent to some level, the question comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be what is the main purpose of prison in any modern society, not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that of the US:  Is prison supposed to be punitive, or is it supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be rehabilitative?  And can it possibly be both at the same time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Prisons historically have been places of punishment, either for crimes
<br>
against other individuals (i.e. you stole my car, you're going to prison),
<br>
or just as often, for crimes against the ruling caste/king/mob (i.e. you
<br>
expressed a different opinion than the chairman, you're going to jail).
<br>
<p>I would argue that this is a waste of resources. In those cases where reform
<br>
is possible, then rehabilitate and require the offender to pay the monetary
<br>
cost of both his rehabilitation, and the crime itself. In the case of serial
<br>
killers and rapists (where in most cases there is no rehabilitation
<br>
possible), I support the death penalty. In the case that a person truly is a
<br>
&quot;danger to society&quot;, they should be removed from the society, permanently.
<br>
We would put down a rabid dog...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Granted - the question of if prison should really exist at all or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is never seriously addressed.  What is the nature of crime and punishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a situation where the locus of power is geared more towards the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual than any social structure?  On what foundation does the concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;criminal justice&quot; lay?  Does any governmental instrument have either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right or the responsibility to attempt to rehabilitate or punish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals, and how would this idea scale into a more libertarian/econo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarchic model?
</em><br>
<p>Criminal justice (just as with any other social structure) relies on one of
<br>
two principles: the ruling junta's ability to buy or manufacture weapons
<br>
with which to enforce their policies, or alternatively the agreement of the
<br>
majority of the public that this is how we're going to handle things. Make
<br>
no mistake, the final argument in either case is the same. The stronger
<br>
force is always the decider.
<br>
