posts to this list that I shared with them:]

<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, I think talk about what you REALLY seem to want is so

far 
<br>

on 
<br>
<em>&gt; too strongly. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What we need, I think, is a robust vision of a technologically advanced 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seem to draw away the audience. Maybe it's because conflict and fear 
</em><br>
of 
<br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;corporate interests&quot; of &quot;globalization&quot; and &quot;commodification&quot; makes 
</em><br>
for 
<br>
<em>&gt; an entertaining Weltanschauung, whereas fuel-cell cars and virtual reality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; booths seem kind of trivial and boring.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But talk candidly about your Artificial Man Program, THEN the shit hits 
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt; fan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So you're stuck somewhere in the smack-dab middle of the cultural 
</em><br>
expression 
<br>
<em>&gt; moibus interchange.
</em><br>
<p>You're right about this, Paco, without a doubt.  The problem, as you say, is 
<br>
that one group of people - the fast-developing alliance between traditional 
<br>
&quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; in opposition to the basic Enlightenment notion of 
<br>
progress - has managed to craft a set of more or less coherent bogeyman 
<br>
caricatures (the &quot;evil multinational&quot; and the &quot;mad scientist&quot;) that seem to 
<br>
push some powerful psychological buttons with a lot of people.  What I call 
<br>
the &quot;luddite front&quot; (which stretches from Rifkin to Buchanan) offers these 
<br>
caricatures up to a media that thrives on the thrill of reporting on 
<br>
potential catastrophe, and the media becomes an unwitting cohort in the 
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>The bigger problem is that the luddite front is right about one thing: &quot;The 
<br>
future&quot; is arriving at an ever-accelerating pace.  Eschewing discussion of 
<br>
what you call my &quot;Artificial Man Program&quot; in order to keep from freaking 
<br>
people out because they HAVEN'T been looking at the ever-nearing horizon 
<br>
therefore involves some intellectual dishonesty.  I've actually addressed a 
<br>
few groups in Silicon Valley about this problem and have a talk (complete 
<br>
with Power Point slides) I've presented on the subject, in which I offer ways 
<br>
to honestly discuss the issues without needlessly scaring people.

<p><em>&gt;   (Why do you insist on dividing the world into &quot;two&quot; cultures?  Isn't this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like classifying everyone as Democrats or Republicans - stereotyping with 
</em><br>
an 
<br>
<em>&gt; inarticulate broad brush?)
</em><br>
<p>As I mentioned in my first quick reply, my use of the term &quot;the two cultures&quot; 
<br>
was a reference to CP Snow's speech about the divide between the cultural 
<br>
world of the humanities and that of the sciences which was already a yawning 
<br>
gulf when he noted it in the 1950s, and has only grown since.  Beyond this, 
<br>
you make a good point: You're right that I grouse about false dichotomies in 
<br>
politics.  But the idea I'm struggling with is the one that Virginia Postrel 
<br>
points to in the opening passage of her book &quot;The Future and Its Enemies,&quot; 
<br>
i.e. that extremists on the contemporary &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; have more in 
<br>
common than they realize in their similar opposition to scientific and 
<br>
technological progress and their desire to &quot;control&quot; the future in accord 
<br>
with some vision of a &quot;One True Way&quot; (although they differ about what that 
<br>
One True Way is).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Secondly, while I know it is your &quot;thing&quot;, this struggle with the 
</em><br>
luddites, 
<br>
<em>&gt; but are they not a mere phantom?  
</em><br>
<p>As I also mentioned briefly last week, they are not a mere phantom.  The 
<br>
demonstrators that show up at every international forum these days are not 
<br>
phantoms.  The folks who engage in increasingly widespread acts of 
<br>
technological and scientific sabotage are not phantoms.  Their ideological 
<br>
leaders - exemplified in their more &quot;respectable&quot; form in the Turning Point 
<br>
Project (to which I supplied a citation) - are definitely not phantoms.  I've 
<br>
actually spent a little time and energy in using the web to make some maps of 
<br>
the connections among the people who are active in organizing and guiding 
<br>
this cultural movement and those connections are not random.  There is a 
<br>
group of names that shows up over and over linking a front of organizations, 
<br>
writers and activists with a coherent anti-progressive agenda.  One 
<br>
significant irony I've noted is that many of the more respectable ideological 
<br>
leaders of the anti-progress front get their funding from sources like the 
<br>
Rockefeller and Ford Foundations.  But have no doubt that there is a well 
<br>
organized network of people who coordinate the activities of the Green Party 
<br>
(especially in Europe), GreenPeace, and various other groups opposed to all 
<br>
forms of genetic science and technology and the lowering of trade and 
<br>
cultural barriers throughout the world.
<br>
<p>These groups and their leaders share a common disdain for science and 
<br>
technology and Enlightenment values of individual liberty, property rights 
<br>
and open and free commerce among people.  They take advantage of the deep 
<br>
subjectivism of post-modernism to use a rhetoric of &quot;victimism&quot; and 
<br>
irresponsible entitlement.  Their ultimate goal is a kind of cultural 
<br>
Balkanization that - they hope - will cripple humanity's ability to control 
<br>
its own destiny.
<br>
<p>(An interesting side-note.  I have subscribed to and lurk in mailing lists 
<br>
used by various anti-progress groups for organization and discussion.  They 
<br>
DO have their problems, not least of which is a constant low-level mutual 
<br>
irritation between the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; factions of the anti-progress 
<br>
activists.  This is especially amusing in England, where the modern 
<br>
descendants of the National Front and the radical Greens are constantly 
<br>
tripping each other up and bickering.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I've said this before, but I think your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement, which I basically agree with, would be more persuasive if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't promote an &quot;us&quot; against &quot;them&quot; analysis.  I know you need the 
</em><br>
&quot;other 
<br>
<em>&gt; side&quot; to make your struggle real and without the &quot;other&quot; the significance 
</em><br>
of 
<br>
<em>&gt; your movement, or whatever it is, is less dramatic.  Still, I've been 
</em><br>
looking 
<br>
<em>&gt; for luddites since I first heard you use the word and haven't been able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find any, except for possibly the Unibomber.  Even those I'm aware of  who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are fundamentally suspicious of &quot;corporate control&quot; are not anti-technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per se, they simply want those promoting technology to show some maturity 
</em><br>
and 
<br>
<em>&gt; responsibility before inflicting their technologies on the rest of us.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, what they want, is for our humanity not to be lost.  Sometimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this requires taking a quiet pause and to get the quiet it is necessary to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn off the noise.  This is what all of the back to nature crap is about, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really, just trying to be more human and seeking a less complicated world 
</em><br>
in 
<br>
<em>&gt; order to hear the acoustic qualities of a human life without amplification 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and acceleration (sound like Jesse, don't I.)  Sometimes this calls for 
</em><br>
less 
<br>
<em>&gt; machine.  Then again, I'm a guy who thinks the top of the line synthesizer 
</em><br>
is 
<br>
<em>&gt; a cheap, crappy substitute for even a mediocre, acoustic chamber orchestra 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for quality of sound.  (Of course, violins and cellos are sophisticated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little machines in themselves, they just don't need a plug in.) 
</em><br>
<p>The point of my &quot;movement&quot; is that we seek to promote &quot;humane&quot; values, while 
<br>
rejecting a conservatism that we conclude is ultimately &quot;inhumane&quot;.  First, 
<br>
we don't see &quot;modernism&quot; as all of a piece.  We reject a shallow historicism 
<br>
that takes the entirety of the Industrial Revolution as some kind of 
<br>
inseparable conglomerate: Science and technology do not inevitably imply 
<br>
destruction of the non-human, &quot;natural&quot; world.  (I've recently written a &quot;FAQ 
<br>
Answer&quot; about what the term &quot;nature&quot; might more reasonably mean than what it 
<br>
has come to be defined as - it'll be published soon, and I'll provide a cite 
<br>
when it is).  Increased knowledge and human power don't necessarily result in 
<br>
a degradation of the quality of life.
<br>
<p>The problem with the current neo-luddite movement is that it uncritically 
<br>
accepts the idea that all increases in technological power result in a 
<br>
reduction in the quality of life and a &quot;loss of humanity&quot;.  The Unabomber was 
<br>
just among the more articulate spokesmen for this point of view, but it is 
<br>
endemic in our popular culture.  When was the last time a scientist or an 
<br>
entrepreneur was depicted as a hero in a Hollywood movie or a television 
<br>
show?  How often is the brevity and brutality of much of pre-technological 
<br>
human existence portrayed or discussed in popular culture?  Rousseau's &quot;noble 
<br>
savage&quot; has become an uncritically accepted paradigm of those who most 
<br>
influence our world-view.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, your point about music and musical instruments is actually one 
<br>
that is quite apropos.  There was a time when the violin was an innovation, 
<br>
when Baroque music and a string quartet were the Latest Thing.  As you point 
<br>
out, in fact, a violin is a VERY sophisticated machine.  I wouldn't ever 
<br>
argue that a modern digital musical synthesizer is &quot;better&quot; than a violin.  
<br>
However, what's important is to realize that a violin has its limits, as does 
<br>
a synthesizer (although there's another, much longer discussion there that I 
<br>
don't have time for this morning . . .)  The problem with the neo-luddites is 
<br>
that they would say that we shouldn't have synthesizers at all because having 
<br>
them necessarily implies a rejection of violins.  They're wrong.  They raise 
<br>
a false dilemma that is, unfortunately, all too appealing to people who feel 
<br>
threatened by change and lack confidence in making their own choices about 
<br>
what in their own traditions is worth preserving and what should be rejected.
