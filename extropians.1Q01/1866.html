</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I should retract that argument - I am of course always being
<br>
subjective, but perhaps I was trying to sell my subjective outlook as an
<br>
objective one, which it is not. You are right that they are essentially
<br>
anecdotes, not easily verifiable truth, and I cannot possibly defend such an
<br>
argument on purely objective grounds.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I should just try to explain - on a completely personal note,
<br>
without the desire to settle any argument - what I meant when I said that I
<br>
gather America to be more rough than the country I live in. By saying that,
<br>
I didn't mean the residents of the country themselves. Many (most?)
<br>
Americans I've met were more open, more outgoing, more fun to be with than,
<br>
I don't know, Germans. I love that about your country.
<br>
<p>What I dislike is the seriousness with which your government approaches its
<br>
citizens. You walk up into a government institution, and the police officers
<br>
in there walk around with shotguns, and the sign says something like &quot;It is
<br>
a federal crime to attack a police officer&quot; (don't remember the exact
<br>
words). Drive too fast, and they put you in jail. And so on.
<br>
<p>What I am talking about pretty much resembles what you and other posters
<br>
mentioned as one of the primary justifications to posess firearms. That may
<br>
be true, you are the sole judge of that.
<br>
<p>But I was trying to use the same argument the other way around: I think
<br>
there is possibility that attitude of the citizens reinforces the attitude
<br>
of the government. Which in turn reinforces the attitude of the citizens.
<br>
Until there's a civil war...
<br>
<p>If this &quot;reinforcement theory&quot; is true, then your country has already
<br>
drifted way past its European siblings, and is approaching something like
<br>
China. But as said, I cannot defend this on objective grounds. So take it as
<br>
pure speculation.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; This is pretty weak.  Do you really think there is a direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong cause and effect between having no right ot have guns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and improved quality of life?  On what basis?
</em><br>
<p>There are two cases to look at, and you're looking at the other one. If you
<br>
are talking about denying an individual the right to have a gun, then the
<br>
impact on the individual's quality of right is negative. Taking away
<br>
people's rights from the outside is a Bad Thing. I believe in that as much
<br>
as you do.
<br>
<p>But the perspective is totally different if everyone decides that, &quot;OK, we
<br>
don't want any of this dangerous stuff in our sight, let's get rid of it -
<br>
and let's make sure the bad guys can't get it, either.&quot; The total absence of
<br>
guns in a society *does* improve the quality of life of every participating
<br>
indivudual - you can't be shot if there are no guns.
<br>
<p>The trick is in &quot;total absence of guns&quot;. I might agree that, at this time,
<br>
this would be very difficult to achieve in the USA. It should be more than
<br>
just a ban - you would have to make sure that there are no guns, anywhere.
<br>
And that your police and your government agencies behave well from that
<br>
point onward. That would be an exceedingly difficult task - something which
<br>
might even require additional, as yet undeveloped technology to become
<br>
feasible. Or, more probably, some as yet unanticipated global reform in the
<br>
structure of your society.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; In a choice of life or death, who wins matters a lot.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
<br>
Eh - win win, lose lose. Whenever there is a conflict, both sides lose.
<br>
There's no way to win a conflict. In the overall scheme of things, long-term
<br>
happiness might matter a little bit. Short term conflicts, and their short
<br>
term results, matter not. I am sure life after death is just as nice as life
<br>
before death. No need to worry too much about it.
<br>
&lt;/personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; In a choice of being free or enslaved or easy to enslave,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it matters a lot where one is on the spectrum.
</em><br>
<p>See above. [But do note that what I'm saying is just my personal philosophy.
<br>
It's quite extreme, and it does not necessarily have to be yours. Most
<br>
people would probably disagree with me. I let them disagree, no problem with
<br>
that.]
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; If I have a fundamental right to self-defense then how is a majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denying that right any more acceptable than a minority?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
<br>
<p>But you don't have a fundamental right to anything.
<br>
<p>People think they have fundamental rights, and they think some things are
<br>
fundamentally wrong. But that isn't true. Things are the way they are. The
<br>
only thing you really do have is your freedom to do anything that doesn't
<br>
conflict with the laws of physics. That is fundamental, that is universal.
<br>
Other than that, nothing else is fundamental or universal.
<br>
<p>Religions and governments that say otherwise are manipulating with people.
<br>
Their manipulations may have good intentions, but they are nevertheless
<br>
manipulations.
<br>
<p>Hence, your &quot;fundamental rights&quot; translate to what society lets you. Society
<br>
can be changed, and what you perceive as your &quot;fundamental rights&quot; changes
<br>
with the society.
<br>
<p>&lt;/personal-philosophy-mode&gt;
<br>
<p>[Above is not to mean I don't agree with you, it's that I can't even
<br>
contemplate what you said because the way you said it is in conflict with
<br>
what I recognize as universal laws. It's meaningless to me.]
