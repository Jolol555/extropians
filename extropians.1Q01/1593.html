<em>&gt; I'll try to contact Michael Lynch and see what his evidence was.  I thought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had heard this before I saw this article, but as you point out that could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just be due to contagious misinformation.
</em><br>
<p>I appreciate your efforts to track this down.  I've been looking at trying
<br>
to dig through the tariffs for the PX and ISO markets but I can't even figure
<br>
out what the chapter titles mean, so I don't know where to begin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this isn't the case, what alternative hypothesis explains the role of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the $150/MWh price cap?
</em><br>
<p>The price cap makes a certain amount of sense in the context of a
<br>
traditional single price market.  The idea is that you use the highest
<br>
bid price that hour to set the price for all the electricity delivered
<br>
during that hour, except above the price cap you use as-bid rules.
<br>
<p>For example suppose you could buy 50% of your &quot;noon&quot; electricity at $100,
<br>
another 30% at $150, and the remaining 20% at $250.  Under the original
<br>
single-price auction rule you would pay $250 for all the noon electricity.
<br>
Under the new rule you would pay $150 for the first 80% and $250 only
<br>
for the last 20%.  In effect the single-price rule is used up to $150
<br>
and as-bid pricing is used above that cap.
<br>
<p>I think the theory is that prices above $150 are due to exercise of market
<br>
power and are not really legitimate.  Normally the single price auction
<br>
has the advantage that sellers can bid their marginal costs and still
<br>
get the advantage of higher rates bid by others, which encourages sellers
<br>
to bid lower.  However if the highest prices are not true marginal cost
<br>
bids but represent monopoly power, first-price rules have bad effects.
<br>
<p>So they're retaining the single price rule for &quot;normal&quot; auction behavior
<br>
but abandoning it when prices get into a regime which they judge to be
<br>
abnormal and an indication of market manipulation.  The FERC document
<br>
goes to some lengths to argue that $150 is a reasonable breakpoint given
<br>
current costs of production.  However, many participants in the market
<br>
have strongly criticized this rule, from all directions.
