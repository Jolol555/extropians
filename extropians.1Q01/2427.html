[In the absence of quotes or other references, and since the In-Reply-To
<br>
header field seems to point to one of Charlie's messages, I am not entirely
<br>
sure whether the quoted message was primarily addressed to me; it seems
<br>
likely enough, so I will assume so for the purposes of this response.]

<p><em>&gt; The point about which I disagree with you (and I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we disagree all that much--it's difficult to express such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elusive concepts) is the one you made about there being no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workable definition of human nature. At least I interpreted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you wrote to mean this. I generally prefer to avoid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word &quot;nature&quot; because it's been used in ways that render it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearly meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do think there are certain traits that all normal humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share and that these traits can shed light on which social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems are likely to work better than others.
</em><br>
<p>Loosely speaking, I would definitely agree with that.
<br>
<p>In principle, this probably answers your question. I devote the rest of the
<br>
message to minor details, which I don't consider to be as important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a strict point of view, I would have some reservations with regard to
</em><br>
the phrase &quot;all normal humans&quot;; I'd prefer &quot;most humans&quot; instead, because
<br>
&quot;normal&quot; is a very subjective term.
<br>
<p>For instance, my mother is an ardent catholic, and she often uses the term
<br>
&quot;normal people&quot; do denote people who share her opinions and views -
<br>
specifically, people who would prefer her views to mine. On the other hand,
<br>
I often use the term &quot;normal people&quot; to denote people who share *my*
<br>
opinions and views - specifically, people who would prefer my views to hers.
<br>
So, the words &quot;normal people&quot; don't really convey a lot of meaning unless it
<br>
is known who said them.
<br>
<p>I might even have reservations with regard to the phrase &quot;most humans&quot;,
<br>
because I don't know enough about the world to reliably make such a
<br>
statement. But since you say &quot;certain traits&quot;, and &quot;shed light&quot;, and &quot;likely
<br>
to work better&quot;, I am inclined to agree completely.
