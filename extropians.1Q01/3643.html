<em>&gt;  I've been looking at the guaranteed income from a new perspective since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reading Chapter 7 of THE SPIKE.
</em><br>
<p>I confess it was the part of Damien's book that made me grit my teeth - but, 
<br>
hey, he's Australian, so you have to cut him some slack :-0
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The main reason I can think of for not having a government-provided 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  guaranteed income is that it is morally wrong for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    one group of people calling themselves &quot;the government&quot; to steal from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  another group of people, regardless of how the thieves dispose of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  stolen goods. A guaranteed income would seem to require that this sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  theft be perpetrated.
</em><br>
<p>I certainly agree.  Which is why the &quot;true abundance&quot; idea we're discussing 
<br>
here has the potential to be &quot;something completely different&quot; in Monty 
<br>
Pythonesque terms.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;    In Chapter 7 of THE SPIKE Damien mentions, in passing, the concept of 
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt;  guaranteed income as an inheritance. [&quot;...let's not look at a guaranteed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  income as a 'natural right,' like the supposed innate rights to freedom of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  speech and liberty. Rather it is an inheritance, something *owed* to all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the children of a society whose ancestors for generations have together 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  built, and purchased through the work of their minds and hands, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  resource base sustaining today's cornucopia.&quot;]  I like this idea a lot, 
</em><br>
and 
<br>
<em>&gt;  it ties into the discussion we were recently having about &quot;human nature.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  For all the years of the existence of  *Homo sapiens sapiens* other than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the tiniest fraction representing the last 10,000 years or so, members of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the species lived in relatively small groups. Based on the available 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  evidence, up until the start of agriculture, a typical human could expect 
</em><br>
a 
<br>
<em>&gt;  guaranteed income something like what Denis listed (excepting, maybe, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  unrestricted access to information--but one's access to information would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not be restricted according to the amount of material wealth one 
</em><br>
produced). 
<br>
<em>&gt;  The scientific discoveries which have most changed our lives were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  apparently made by people living under these conditions (domestication of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  crops and animals, for example--all the major food crops and animals were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  domesticated during this period).
</em><br>
<p>I think it's important when employing this kind of reasoning to consider that 
<br>
there was GREAT diversity in the quality of life of pre-agricultural people, 
<br>
including everything from situations in which individuals had to do very 
<br>
little &quot;work&quot; to sustain themselves (I'm thinking of cultures like those of 
<br>
the American Pacific Northwest Indians) to people who lived at - and then 
<br>
died beyond - the margin of extinction.  The size and structure of social 
<br>
groups also varied somewhat (there's certainly evidence for a few, brief, 
<br>
large concentrations of Neolithic people).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The problem with having a guaranteed income administered by a centralized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  government with power over a large number of people inhabiting a large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  geographical area is the lack of personal interaction between donors and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  recipients. These sorts of systems always seem to cave in on themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  through mismanagement and corruption.
</em><br>
<p>This seems right - face-to-face social support by people one knows well 
<br>
definitely has a different &quot;moral texture&quot; from a bureaucratically 
<br>
administered social welfare system.  As you say, Barbara, there also seem to 
<br>
be some inherent - and perhaps cascading - inefficiencies in the latter (i.e. 
<br>
the increasing burden of administration as the size of the system grows tends 
<br>
to sap the end benefit bestowed on the intended targets).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  But our present system isn't working very well either. Not for the vast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  majority of people living within it. Most people spend the majority of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their time doing things they don't want to be doing. For most people, life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cannot be said to be joyful. One reason for this seems to be the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  association of having a job with being a respectable person. The problem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with this is that a huge portion of the &quot;work&quot; done each day is bullshit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;busy work.&quot;  An example of busy work in school: my daughter and I used to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  spend a certain part of each year traveling, and I'd get the lesson plans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  from the teachers so she could keep up with her class at school. We'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  always finish a day's work in an hour and a half or less. I understand 
</em><br>
that 
<br>
<em>&gt;  something like 80% of the productive work in business organizations is 
</em><br>
done 
<br>
<em>&gt;  in 20% of the time. The other 80% of the time is spent non productively 
</em><br>
(if 
<br>
<em>&gt;  productivity is measured in terms of advancing toward a desirable goal). I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  think much of what people do these days is motivated by a need to stay 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  busy. Work is invented.
</em><br>
<p>That's true -- a WHOLE lot of what has gone on in any office environment in 
<br>
which I've worked has been basic monkey-business, i.e. socializing.  Of 
<br>
course, in some businesses, the monkey-business IS the business, i.e. 
<br>
networking, determining and signaling intentions, etc.  It'd be interesting 
<br>
to see some social anthropology studies about &quot;industrial&quot; workers and see 
<br>
how much time is spent in socializing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Another quote from THE SPIKE: &quot;In a world mutating ever more swiftly under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the impact of high technology, detestable toil will be very hard to find, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or even invent.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I sincerely hope this is true.  We will have to be careful about 
<br>
accommodating the natural human (and I'm willing to bet, post-human) desire 
<br>
for structured social activity that the best of &quot;work&quot; provides.  In a world 
<br>
of &quot;true abundance&quot;, I expect that people will do this.  Let us hope they do 
<br>
it in creative and -- as you say, Barbara, &quot;joyful&quot; -- ways.
