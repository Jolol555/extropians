<p><p>How so?  Current levels of violent crime in Europe are at highs that

haven't been touched in a very long time.  The murder rates in many 
<br>
European countries are higher than they were a century ago.  And several of 
<br>
the largest government killing sprees ever have happened within the last 
<br>
four or five decades.

<p><p>I would agree with this currently, but this could change in the period of a 
<br>
decade or two.  While I don't believe global warfare is as likely as it was 
<br>
in previous generations, there has still frequently been about one war per 
<br>
generation since the beginning of history for most of the world's 
<br>
populations.  The last half-century has been no exception.  We've fought 
<br>
the &quot;Last War&quot; an awful lot of times, and generally, people actually 
<br>
believe it; U.S. military history is full of embarrassing examples of this 
<br>
nature.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Again: go back to the 1830's and English upper-class types went
</em><br>
<em>&gt;armed in public because there was a very real probability of violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if they didn't. The fact that the British government *can* ban handguns
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>This is not an accurate representation.  The crime/murder rates in England 
<br>
dropped sharply from the 1830s to the 1890s.  In fact, the murder/violence 
<br>
rate in England at the end of the 19th century was substantially lower than 
<br>
it is at the end of the 20th century.  Gun control laws did not go into 
<br>
effect until after the first World War, mostly due to fears of civil 
<br>
unrest.  The last half-century in England has been quite violent by 
<br>
historical standards.
<br>
<p>I don't want to get into a debate over this, but violent crime dropped 
<br>
sharply after the English started going out armed as a matter of habit 
<br>
during the first half of the 19th century in response to the high crime 
<br>
rate.  Violent crime then increased substantially after WW1 when the 
<br>
English government forbade and controlled weapon possession.  Maybe an 
<br>
armed society *is* a polite society.
