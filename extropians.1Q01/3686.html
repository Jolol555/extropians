<p><em>&gt;I confess it was the part of Damien's book that made me grit my teeth - but,

</em><br>
<p>Correct - I've had more experience of living in a nation where certain
<br>
goods are more or less readily available to all at very modest price, such
<br>
as Celebrex for arthritis sufferers, which now costs $A20 (roughly half
<br>
that in $US) a month and relieves a truly shocking amount of human misery.
<br>
Our polity, based in part at least on the mythic notion of `a fair go' (an
<br>
egalitarian ambition), regards as a fair deal the subsidy by healthy people
<br>
of those in later life suffering this disability, partly because the impact
<br>
is both unpredictable and quite likely to afflict anyone who gets old
<br>
enough. To some extent, we have chosen to fund this via taxation rather
<br>
than private insurance, in the belief that it's more efficient to do that,
<br>
and out of a history where very many people had no discretionary funds to
<br>
spend on insurance.
<br>
<p>But that's not really the point. The guaranteed income model I promote in
<br>
THE SPIKE in not an Aussie idea. It was developed by an economist who lived
<br>
for most of his life in the USA, Robert Theobald. Granted, he had a far
<br>
greater proportional following, in recent years, in Australia and Canada.
<br>
But his books were originally published in the States.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  The problem with having a guaranteed income administered by a centralized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  government with power over a large number of people inhabiting a large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  geographical area is the lack of personal interaction between donors and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  recipients. These sorts of systems always seem to cave in on themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  through mismanagement and corruption.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;As you say, Barbara, there also seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be some inherent - and perhaps cascading - inefficiencies in the latter
</em><br>
(i.e. 
<br>
<em>&gt;the increasing burden of administration as the size of the system grows
</em><br>
tends 
<br>
<em>&gt;to sap the end benefit bestowed on the intended targets).
</em><br>
<p>But this misses the key aspect of Theobald's proposal (and that mad
<br>
socialist Milton Friedman's), which is to *abolish* most of the
<br>
bureaucratic meddling and tinkering by making the income floor a
<br>
*guaranteed `right'*, a secure floor permitting either enterprise or sloth.
<br>
True, most models then propose higher taxes once incomes start to exceed
<br>
that minimum, but this needn't be any more complex or horrid than the way
<br>
things are done now.
<br>
<p>But where the money going to come from? I'm not going to pay some lazy
<br>
thief to loll around, or suffer my rightful earnings to be extorted from
<br>
me! --Different points, those. Irrelevant to this particular objection. (Or
<br>
so it seems to me.)
