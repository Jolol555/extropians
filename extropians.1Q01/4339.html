</em><br>
<p>I would like to raise an objection to this tactic that you've used 
<br>
several times in your post - I won't bother responding to each one. 
<br>
You take an idea that was eventually proven to be fact, and then use 
<br>
that as an analogy to show that your idea will eventually be proven 
<br>
to be fact.  The error is that you neglect to mention the billions of 
<br>
ideas that are proven to be untrue for every one like the above that 
<br>
actually did turn out to be true.  Cryonics might be one of the 
<br>
zillions of failures, it might be one of the much fewer successes. 
<br>
Without *scientific evidence*, we just don't know.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; It has a zero rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of return of people to the human population, and I've yet to see any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;evidence that that's going to change right over the horizon... or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;next horizon... or the one after that. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With all due respect, I don't think you understand cryonics.  Please don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feel insulted.  There is an aspect of cryonics so unprecedented, so outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the human experience, that even people intimately acquainted with cryonics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people who know the FACTS, still don't 'get' it.  Cryonics stops time.
</em><br>
<p>In a sense, but you don't *know* that it will bring about the result 
<br>
that you need - to restore people to some reasonable percentage of 
<br>
their previous state.  How do we know that irreversible brain damage 
<br>
and memory loss don't happen within a few minutes of dying?  How do 
<br>
we know that the very act of taking someone's body to such low 
<br>
temperatures doesn't *permanently* damage who he is?
<br>
<p>Once certain types of damage happen, all the future technology in the 
<br>
world won't help.  They might be able to create a functioning human 
<br>
being again, but if it doesn't have most of the memories and thought 
<br>
processes of the original, what good is it?  You might as well have 
<br>
just taken a DNA sample and frozen it for later cloning.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I detect a note of smugness.  Try out the receiving end:  You know, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppose, all that the future holds?  I grovel before the awesome power of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your intellect,...or is it your crystal ball?
</em><br>
<p>You're right, I don't know all the future holds.  That's the point, 
<br>
because neither do you - but you're still willing to sue medical 
<br>
professionals dealing with health problems in the here and now, for 
<br>
something that's sheer speculation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Cryonics stops time.  That is its unprecedented power.  What has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accomplished from 1877 until today is irrelevant.  The accomplishments of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the next thousand years?,... irrelevant.  Cryonics brings to bear the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limits of the possible.  Grasp the implications of that and you will then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'get' cryonics.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I 'get' it.  It's your religion.  Substitute &quot;Jesus&quot; for 
<br>
&quot;cryonics&quot;, and I've heard it all before.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;You're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;suggesting that doctors pursue unscientific treatments for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;patients, or they'll be sued.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thermodynamics is sufficiently scientific to validate cryonics.
</em><br>
<p>No it's not.  You have no clue as to what kind of damage is done to 
<br>
an organism after death and in the freezing process.  Thermodynamics 
<br>
is just one piece of the puzzle, and even though it &quot;stops time&quot;, it 
<br>
doesn't *reverse* time, which may be what's needed to undo tissue 
<br>
damage.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;By the same logic, medical professionals could be sued for not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;advising all of their dying patients that they should believe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Jesus Christ. If we can't base a belief upon scientific principles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;we might as well go with a popularity contest, right?  Next to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;number of people in this world (doctors included) who believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Jesus Christ is the solution to death, cryonics adherents are nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The analogy is inapplicable.  Religion is clearly unscientific.
</em><br>
<p>You're banking on the limitless discoveries of the future, but you 
<br>
can't believe in the limitless possibilities of the past?  What if 
<br>
God is just some super-technical being who has existed long enough to 
<br>
accomplish everything that religion has him accomplishing?
<br>
<p>Why is one person's guess as to what may be possible any worse than 
<br>
yours?  Why is one guess &quot;clearly unscientific&quot;, but your guess is 
<br>
&quot;scientific&quot;?  Belief in Jesus and belief that cryonics will solve 
<br>
everything both take good-sized leaps of faith.  When you make a big 
<br>
leap of faith, you leave the realm of science and anyone's guess is 
<br>
as good as anyone else's.  Suing someone over not buying in to your 
<br>
faith based guesses is unethical.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You don't find the cryonics thesis compelling, so you feel put upon by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who do, so you denigrate it with 'frivolous', 'stunt', and 'cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advertisement'.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, you're wrong about my view of cryonics.  I find it very 
<br>
interesting and might even have it done to myself when the time 
<br>
comes.  However, if I do so, it will only be a last-minute act of 
<br>
desperation, not a venture into something known or probable.  I might 
<br>
also say a little prayer to Jesus, too.  You never know. :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   This is exactly the attitude which makes the lawsuit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary.  I (and probably most cryonicists) don't denigrate the medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;profession, and I DEMAND the same respect.
</em><br>
<p>I'd say that to feel denigrated when someone simply asks you for 
<br>
evidence is an irrational response.
<br>
<p>Don't blame others (esp. doctors) for failing to drink the liquid 
<br>
nitrogen Kool-AidÅ with you.  Instead, take some responsibility for 
<br>
the fact that cryonic restoration has *no* evidence.  Keep performing 
<br>
experiments (or funding them with your money), and who knows?  Maybe 
<br>
one day you'll be shown to have been right.
<br>
<p>If I'm revived too, I'll look you up and buy you dinner.
<br>
