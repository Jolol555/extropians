1. Time to mobilize on human cloning &amp; human GM
<p>Exploratory Initiative on the New Human Genetic Technologies
466 Green St.
San Francisco, CA 94133
<p>January 25, 2001
<p>Dear Friends,
<p>The new human genetic technologies are bringing us to the edge of a
crisis in human history.
<p>In just the last few weeks we've seen the creation in the USA of the
first genetically-enhanced primate, continued rumors of secret human
cloning experiments in Asia and the Caribbean, and a patent issued in
the UK for &quot;designer sperm.&quot;
<p>Proponents of the &quot;techno-eugenic&quot; future celebrate a world of human
clones and made-to-order designer babies. To go down this road would
mean the end of our common humanity and open the door to a genetic caste
system, with horrific implications.
<p>It is time for activists around the world, and for international NGO's,
to begin mobilizing to oppose the transformation of human beings into
technological artifacts. If we cannot stop this, everything else we are
fighting for--social and economic justice, peace and the
environment--will be lost, forever.
<p>On Monday, Feb. 26, activist leaders will be meeting in New York City to
discuss the challenge of the new human genetic technologies and the need
for international activism. We regret the short notice; it was only in
the last week that this meeting was confirmed. This is a preliminary
meeting; no final decisions or policies will be adopted. But we hope it
will lead to plans for subsequent meetings at which representatives from
many countries would gather to focus on substance and strategy.
<p>Our meeting will be at Hunter College in Manhattan.  It follows the
major conference organized by the International Forum on Globalization
on &quot;Globalization and Technology,&quot; (Sat/Sun Feb. 24-25) which includes
plenaries and workshops focused on the dangers of cloning, designer
babies and techno-eugenics. (See &lt;www.ifg.org&gt; for details.)
<p>If a representative of your group would be interested in attending the
Monday meeting and helping plan the agenda, or finding out more about it,
please let us know by reply to this email. We will get in touch promptly
and discuss ways your attendance could be made possible. If you cannot
attend the New York meeting but would like to be involved in planning
for it none-the-less, and/or for subsequent meetings, please let us
know this too.
<p>Sincerely,
<p>Richard Hayes
Dr. Marcy Darnovsky

2. ATTACHMENT: About the Exploratory Initiative
<p>The Exploratory Initiative on the New Human Genetic Technologies
is a growing network of scientists, health professionals, academics,
environmentalists, civil society leaders and others who are concerned
about the lack of effective societal oversight over many of the new
human genetic and reproductive technologies. Proper use of these
technologies holds much promise for preventing disease and relieving
suffering, but improper use could have horrific consequences. We
believe human society has the responsibility to support the former
and oppose the latter.
<p>Participants in the Exploratory Initiative are particularly concerned
about technologies of germline genetic manipulation and human
reproductive
cloning. These applications represent threshold technologies that would
undermine our commitments to human rights and social justice, and that
literally threaten our common humanity.
<p>Over the past months participants in the Exploratory Initiative have met
with leaders of U.S. and international medical and scientific bodies,
environmental organizations, women's health organizations, religious
denominations, indigenous rights organizations, disability rights
organizations, public interest research institutes, philanthropic
organizations, academic bodies, legal academies, and other goups. In
February 2000 the Exploratory Initiative authored the statement opposing
human  'germline' manipulation (changing the genes we pass to our
children) circulated at the Asilomar Symposium on Science, Ethics and
Society, held  in Pacific Grove, California. This statement was signed
by nearly 250  scientists, academics, and others.
<p>Over the coming months the Exploratory Initiative hopes to engage
additional leaders and activists from a broad range of fields and social
constituencies concerning the implications of the new human genetic
technologies and the need for responsible controls. We anticipate that
both national legislation and international accords will be needed to
address the proper use of the new human genetic technologies.
<p>We encourage all who share our concerns to join with us to help build
this urgent endeavor.

Cosmetic genetics engineering could be near
<p>Thursday, 25 January 2001 18:27 (ET)
<p>Cosmetic genetics engineering could be near
<p>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 25 (UPI) -- A leading scientist at the World
Economic Forum said that genetic research may soon be used for cosmetic
or other non-medical purposes, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.
<p>Speaking at the forum, George Church said people eventually might alter
genes to pass on certain characteristics to future generations, but in
the near term genetic engineering of those already alive would be possible.
<p>He said the characteristics could be related to intelligence or looks.
<p>Children or adults could be genetically engineered for more immediate
effects, Church said.
<p>&quot;We may think of this as less of a threat because it is not inherited and
therefore does not capture emotion in the same way as germ line changes,
but it would have an effect far more quickly than genetic engineering
that relies on procreation,&quot; Church said, and the Times reported.
<p>He also said that immediate engineering would be easier than trying to
estimate the effect of changes on a new embryo.

4. Quotes in support of human GE
<p>Lester Thurow, professor of economics, Sloan School of Management, MIT:
&quot;Some will hate it, some will love it, but biotechnology is inevitably
leading to a world in which plants, animals and human beings are going
to be partly man-made... Suppose parents could add 30 points to their
children's IQ.   Wouldn't you want to do it?  And if you don't, your
child will be the stupidest child in the neighborhood.&quot;
<p>New Scientist editorial: &quot;The Last Taboo: If genetic engineering could
be made safe, would you let your baby have it?&quot;:
&quot;...if you ask would-be parents if they'd like to give their children a
head-start at school or on the athletics track, don't be surprised to
find that the opposition is less than absolute... It would be a mistake
to expect the taboo on human genetic engineering to last forever.&quot;
<p>James Watson, Nobel laureate and founding director of the Human Genome
Project:
&quot;...if we could make better human beings by knowing how to add genes,
why shouldn't we?  What's wrong with it?...Evolution can be just
damn cruel, and to say that we've got a perfect genome and there's some
sanctity to it?  I'd just like to know where that idea comes from.
It's utter silliness.&quot;
<p>Gregory Pence, professor of philosophy in the Schools of Medicine and
Arts/Humanities at the University of Alabama:
&quot;Many people love their retrievers and their sunny dispositions around
children and adults. Could people be chosen in the same way?
Would it be so terrible to allow parents to at least aim for a certain
type, in the same way that great breeders...try to match a breed of dog
to the needs of a family?&quot;
<p>Francis Fukuyama, professor of public policy at the Institute for Public
Policy at George Mason University :
&quot;Biotechnology will be able to accomplish what the radical ideologies of
the past, with their unbelievably crude techniques, were unable to
accomplish: to bring about a new type of human being... Within the next
couple of generations...we will have definitively finished human
History because we will have abolished human beings as such. And then, a
new posthuman history will begin.&quot;
<p>Gregory Stock, Director of UCLA's Program on Medicine, Technology and
Society:
&quot;Once people begin to reshape themselves through biological
manipulation, the definition of human begins to drift.... Altering even
a small
number of the key genes regulating human growth might change human
beings into something quite different....But asking whether such
changes are 'wise' or 'desirable' misses the essential point that they
are largely not a matter of choice; they are the unavoidable product
of...technological advance...&quot;
<p>Lee Silver, professor of molecular biology and neuroscience at Princeton
University:
[In the future...] &quot;The GenRich—who account for 10 percent of the
American population—all carry synthetic genes....All aspects of the
economy, the media, the entertainment industry, and the knowledge
industry are controlled by members of the GenRich class....Naturals
work as low-paid service providers or as laborers... [Eventually] the
GenRich class and the Natural class will become...entirely separate
species with no ability to cross-breed, and with as much romantic
interest in each other as a current human would have for a
chimpanzee...But in all cases, I will argue, the use of reprogenetic
technologies is inevitable...whether we like it or not, the global
marketplace will reign supreme.&quot;
<p>ABC NEWS.com;  Arthur Caplan is Director of the University of
Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics:
&quot;Absolutely, somewhere in the next millennium, making babies sexually
will be rare,&quot;[bioethicist Arthur] Caplan speculates.  Many parents
will leap at the chance to make their children smarter, fitter and
prettier.&quot;

5. Statement of support for human cloning -- signatories include:
<p>Sir Hermann Bondi, Fellow of the Royal Society
Francis Crick, Nobel Laureate in Physiology
Richard Dawkins, Professor of Public Understanding of Science, Oxford
José Delgado, Director, Centro de Estudios Neurobiologicos

University,
<p>Declaration in Defense of Cloning and the Integrity of Scientific
Research
<p>...We see no inherent ethical dilemmas in cloning nonhuman higher
animals. Nor is it clear to us that future developments in cloning
human tissues or even cloning human beings will create moral
predicaments beyond the capacity of human reason to resolve. The moral
issues raised by cloning are neither larger nor more profound than the
questions human beings have already faced in regards to such
technologies as nuclear energy, recombinant DNA, and computer
encryption. They are simply new.
<p>Historically, the Luddite option, which seeks to turn back the clock and
limit or prohibit the application of already existing technologies, has
never proven realistic or productive. The potential benefits of cloning
may be so immense that it would be a tragedy if ancient theological
scruples should lead to a Luddite rejection of cloning. We call for
continued, responsible development of cloning technologies, and for a
broad-based commitment to ensuring that traditionalist and obscurantist
views do not irrelevantly obstruct beneficial scientific
developments.
