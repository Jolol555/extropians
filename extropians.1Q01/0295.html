&quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Mars%20in%20two%20weeks?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101051859.LAA23032@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt; gave me the formulas and
<br>
told me to do the math.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh shoot, I thought someone would do the math for me.
<br>
We'll thanks for the formulas and the distance.
<br>
<p>OK, see If I have this right:
<br>
<p><p>45,000,000 * 5280 = 237,600,000,000 ft
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(half way point in feet when planets are nearest each other)
<br>
<p>32 t^2
<br>
------   = 237,600,000,000 ft
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2
<br>
<p>t^2 = 14,850,000,000
<br>
<p>t =~ 121,860 seconds
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8640 seconds/day
<br>
<p>t =~ 14 days
<br>
<p><p>How convinient!  So that gives 2 weeks when the planets are nearest
<br>
each other to get half way there and up to full speed which would be:
<br>
<p>V = t*a
<br>
<p>V = 121860 * 32  ft/sec
<br>
V = 3,899,520    ft/sec
<br>
V = 738          miles/sec
<br>
V = 2,658,763    miles/hour
<br>
<p>Then another 2 weeks to slow down and travel the second half of the
<br>
distance for a total of 4 weeks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would make me guess that doing the trip twice that fast
<br>
(2 weeks instead of 4) would put someone near a constant 2 g
<br>
acceleration the entire trip (or is it non linear or something?)  I'd
<br>
bet this would be kind of hard to endure, yet likely possible for a
<br>
very fit person. (imagine how fit he'd be after arriving on Mars which
<br>
has around .5 g right? ;) It would be more or less impossible for a
<br>
non modified human to do much faster than 2 weeks right?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a trip that would be to do it in 2 weeks!  How much more
<br>
would a twin brother staying at home have aged than you after having
<br>
made such a round trip to Mars and back?  Or is this not yet enough
<br>
acceleration to make a significant difference?  How much time at 1 or
<br>
2 Gs does it take to make a difference?
<br>
