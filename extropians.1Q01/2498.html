<p>Yes, it does. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, there's a point at which having a big ego and being
<br>
success-oriented and forceful stops being good and starts being dangerous.
<br>
<p>Ruthless drive un-hampered by compassion or empathy is _not_ a trait I
<br>
want to encourage in my peers.  And I'm not convinced that those guys
<br>
don't have it. I may be wrong -- they may be truly wonderful folks when
<br>
you get to know them -- but some of them (Larry Ellison in particular)
<br>
give the impression of being about as easy to coexist with as a cobra.
