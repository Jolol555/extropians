<p>Yes.  This is where I would very much support some automation in the
<br>
cars.  But I would support it being much smarter.  One of the things it
<br>
would do would be to continuously evaluate the performance of the
<br>
operator and to adjust the amount of automation and maximum speed
<br>
allowed accordingly.  Some days I simply want to tool along and other
<br>
days 90 feels like standing still and I'm perfectly tuned in.  Of course
<br>
I also want the car/system to be able to drive itself so I can do more
<br>
important things like surf the web, do my email and hack code.  &lt;g&gt;
