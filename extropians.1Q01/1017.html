<p>
With the recent slight outbreak of relatively mild incivility and 
<br>
hypertrophied posting relating to guns (mild by the standards of previous 
<br>
&quot;gun battles&quot;), I thought I'd take a moment to make a few comments regarding 
<br>
issues of &quot;list culture.&quot;
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  Although it's been discussed in various terms over the years, it seems 
<br>
that complaints about the quality and signal/noise ratio of this list (and 
<br>
every other one I've participated in) boil down to some form of &quot;tragedy of 
<br>
the commons&quot;.  The list, being essentially a free resource for its users, 
<br>
doesn't automatically impose any limits on postings by any particular 
<br>
individual.  There is no feedback mechanism built into a list such as this 
<br>
one to put a brake on self-reinforcing &quot;flame wars&quot; that can develop over 
<br>
&quot;hot-button issues&quot;.
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  Although discussion of design of mechanisms for some kind of &quot;automatic&quot; 
<br>
regulation of list content that would improve the over-all quality of 
<br>
postings is a perennial favorite (and one I think we should continue to 
<br>
explore), the simple fact is that no one has come up with a way to make a 
<br>
list server like this one work to somehow automatically filter low-quality 
<br>
posts.  Instead, the level of discussion on the list is a function of the 
<br>
judgments made by all the list participants individually.
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  List participants come and go.  As a result, unless someone takes the 
<br>
time to carefully read the entirety of the archives before they post (which 
<br>
it is unreasonable to expect people to do), there is a natural, constant 
<br>
level of discontinuity in the awareness that many list subscribers will have 
<br>
of the history of specific subjects.  Thus a discussion that turns nasty, 
<br>
spirals into a high-volume, low-quality flame war or simply turns off a large 
<br>
portion of the list community can be reignited by someone unaware of how such 
<br>
an incident has been worked out in the past.
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  In the &quot;governance&quot; of a resource like this list, there is a natural 
<br>
trade-off between two values that extropians hold to be very important: the 
<br>
open discussion of ideas, and the right of individuals to regulate their own 
<br>
life and environment.  As the guidelines for use of this list make very 
<br>
clear, the forum for this list community is the &quot;property&quot; of Extropy 
<br>
Institute, a private institution ultimately answerable only to the people who 
<br>
support our mission sufficiently to become members of ExI.  Accordingly, ExI 
<br>
has the right to set the terms of subscription, regulate the content and tone 
<br>
of discussion and generally run the list as its officers see fit.  However, 
<br>
the practicalities of the technology of a relatively open list server that is 
<br>
managed by volunteer labor on a part-time basis, and our desire to maintain a 
<br>
maximally open forum for non-members as well as members to discuss ideas and 
<br>
issues related to the Extropian Principles dictate that we cannot closely 
<br>
control subscription.  
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  The above facts mean that &quot;unsubscribing&quot; people from the list is a 
<br>
singularly ineffective tool for list governance.  As has been proven on 
<br>
multiple occasions, applying this &quot;ultimate sanction&quot; against someone who 
<br>
repeatedly breaches the list's minimal rules regarding the content and tone 
<br>
of messages usually just results in resubscription by the offender with a new 
<br>
e-mail account.  Attempts to screen subscriptions are prohibitively 
<br>
labor-intensive, can involve invasive &quot;background checks&quot; and, in any event, 
<br>
are easily circumvented.  This means that it is essentially impossible to 
<br>
stop through mechanisms of &quot;list governance&quot; someone who has a motivation or 
<br>
agenda that can result in inciting disruptive flame wars .
<br>
<p>Does this mean that we should allow people with an obsessive agenda or a lack 
<br>
of self-control to dictate how more reasonable people carry on their 
<br>
discussions here, or the topics we can discuss?  No.  What it does mean is 
<br>
that responsible and reasonable members of this list community have to be 
<br>
aware that individuals CAN hijack the list through the mechanism of 
<br>
high-volume posts and the use of incendiary language and rhetoric.  A key 
<br>
ingredient in this unfortunate phenomenon is the natural human tendency to 
<br>
become inflamed by aggressive and offensive words.  No one is immune to 
<br>
having their feelings hurt or their sensibilities enraged when another person 
<br>
uses aggressive or insulting language.  But part of what we seek to become as 
<br>
extropians is more rational and more emotionally mature individuals.  
<br>
Consider the phenomenon of the single-issue obsessive to be a test of your 
<br>
commitment to reason and becoming a more emotionally sophisticated person.  
<br>
After all, we all note that SOME posts which are off-topic or which don't 
<br>
really challenge us to engage in valuable discussions are simply ignored by 
<br>
the list.  Most folks who post such material simply &quot;go away&quot;, finding some 
<br>
more suitable forum for their writing.
<br>
<p>Ignoring an offensive poster probably isn't appropriate when the core subject 
<br>
matter of extropian ideas or values is addressed by their writing.  Also, if 
<br>
you're new to the list or recently returned after an absence and don't 
<br>
realize that an offensive poster is a &quot;repeat offender&quot;, you won't know that 
<br>
simply ignoring them is the best course of action.  But it shouldn't take 
<br>
long to realize you've stepped onto a &quot;troll&quot; if you do.  Responsible list 
<br>
regulars should take the time to warn -- offlist -- a &quot;newbie&quot; or a returning 
<br>
&quot;old timer&quot; that they've triggered a repeat offender.  Reason and good taste 
<br>
should dictate that, once one has stated one's position and detected a lack 
<br>
of reciprocal reason or good taste, simply discontinuing a dialogue with such 
<br>
a person is the best course of action.
<br>
<p>Finally, remember that the overwhelming majority of our regular posters are 
<br>
&quot;good citizens&quot; and keep the discussion here on a consistently high level.  
<br>
Given how easy it is to disrupt an online community such as the ExList, we 
<br>
should all be proud of the fact that this is one of the longest-running and 
<br>
highest-quality sources of information and discussion on the Net.
