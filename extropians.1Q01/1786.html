</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>How about you, Damien? Read the stats:
<br>
<p>According to FBI crime stats for the US for 1999, out of 230.476 million
<br>
people, there were 12,266 murders and non-negligent manslaughters (with
<br>
no cause of death breakdown), which is approximately three times higher
<br>
rate overall. Now lets look at regions, since there are some regions
<br>
whose laws are much like Australias and others that are not.
<br>
The Northeast, which includes New England and mid Atlantic states, with
<br>
a population of 47.108 million, had 1,800 murders and n-n manslaughters,
<br>
which is a rate approximately twice that of australia. New England
<br>
specifically, which is divided between gun control and non gun control
<br>
states, had only 295 murders and nn manslaughters out of a population of
<br>
12.198 million, which is approximately equal to that of Australia on a
<br>
rate basis.
<br>
<p>We can look at the south atlantic states and see for a similar 47
<br>
million person population, a huge wave of 2,997 murders and nn
<br>
manslaughters, which is about nine times that of Australia.
<br>
<p>Out of 112 thousand robberies where guns were used, 99 thousand occurred
<br>
in cities, and 57,000 of these in just 57 cities with populations of
<br>
250,000 and over. Out of 115 thousand aggravated assaults with a gun, 92
<br>
thousand occured in cities, with 49 thousand in the 57 cities with
<br>
populations over 250,000. These 57 cities house only 41 million people
<br>
(about one sixth of our population) but account for half of gun related
<br>
robberies and assaults. Of the murders and nn manslaughters, 2,651
<br>
occured in those largest cities, or over 21% of the whole for less than
<br>
16% of the population. These largest cities also feature the most
<br>
restrictive gun laws in the nation.
<br>
<p>Out of the 5,661 cities with populations under 10,000, which totals up
<br>
to just over 19 million people (i.e. the population of Australia), the
<br>
murders and non-negligent manslaughters totaled 374, which is only
<br>
slightly higher than Australias total, despite such communities hosting
<br>
high gun owning populations. Among all suburban and rural counties
<br>
(population 85 million) there were 1,802 murders and nn manslaughters,
<br>
which comes out to about 400 per 19 million in some of the most freely
<br>
gun wheeling areas of the country. Oh, and by the way: these crime rates
<br>
are dropping every year. Australias rates are rising every year...
<br>
<p>Nationwide, murder rates peaked in 1980 and 1991, years of significant
<br>
economic distress. They were lowest in 1963, 1985, and 1999, periods of
<br>
significant economic prosperity.
<br>
<p>Oh, heres my cite:
<br>
<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_99/99crime/99cius5.pdf">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_99/99crime/99cius5.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>which, if you look at figures 5.1 and 5.2, you'll see the racial,
<br>
gender, and age breakdown in crime activity. I'll bet Australias racial
<br>
cross section is markedly different. Looking at figure 5.4a, we see the
<br>
lifetime murder breakdown by race and sex per 100,000 population.
<br>
<p>Of course, the Australian Bureau of Statistics is being as cooperative
<br>
as it normally is with crime statistics, and does not provide the sort
<br>
of in depth data that the FBI offers. However the best data I could find
<br>
is a crime report from the Australian Attorney General's office (
<br>
<a href="http://www.ncp.gov.au/ncp/publications/pdf/Crime.pdf">http://www.ncp.gov.au/ncp/publications/pdf/Crime.pdf</a> ) that featured
<br>
lots of nice color graphs that took up lots of space and said little of
<br>
specific interest, although it did admit that indigenous people are
<br>
about 15 times more likely to be imprisoned. 
<br>
In the age and sex breakdowns, Australia does not feature the huge bump
<br>
in homicides found in the 15-35 age group here in the US that is
<br>
entirely due to the black population (i.e. the age and race segment most
<br>
involved in the illegal drug trade) according to FBI statistics. If they
<br>
are removed from the demographics, the US homicide rate tracks very
<br>
closely with the Australian homicide rate. Now, this is rather
<br>
interesting: it is black people in the US who are most restrained by law
<br>
enforcement against legally owning firearms and most excluded from the
<br>
economy due to stereotypes, criminal records, discrimination as well as
<br>
general bad attitudes, and they contribute the most to crime rates.
<br>
Whites are most free to own and carry firearms and have homicide rates
<br>
little different from those found in Australia, which is a far more
<br>
racially monocultural nation than the US is, with its far smaller
<br>
indigenous population being in a very similar state of incarceration in
<br>
the justice system.
