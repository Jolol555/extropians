<br>
<p>Given that aging is caused by the accumulation of random and pleiotropic
<br>
mutations that have not been selected against in the course of human
<br>
evolution (because until recently, humans mostly ended up dead from disease
<br>
or accident long before these mutations kicked in)...
<br>
<p>Then, aging is not a single programmed pathway we can interfere in. It's
<br>
more like a network of interacting pathways, where the evolutionary rules
<br>
of thumb we use to make other biological puzzles tractable no longer apply.
<br>
<p>What can be done.
<br>
<p>1. Borrow the modelling tools and concepts from complexity theory and use
<br>
them to at least narrow the search-space for anti-aging treatments.
<br>
<p>2. Just keep plowing ahead with the leads that look promising at the moment
<br>
and hope we get lucky. Hope that the pathways we happen to block in the
<br>
network of aging-related degenerations happen to be ones that influence a
<br>
large number of other pathways.
<br>
<p><p>In the big picture, if our species manages to survive and remain civilized
<br>
long enough, there will be mild evolutionary pressure for our lifespan to
<br>
increase commensurate with our life expectancy. That's just blind evolution,
<br>
mind you. Directed evolution (i.e. continued molecular biology trial and
<br>
error) should proceed far faster. Of course I'm hoping that we don't have
<br>
to wait for the big picture, that we stumble onto a breakthrough before
<br>
it's liquid nitro time.
<br>
<p><p>As for competing risks that were mentioned, Hayflick sounds pretty much
<br>
on target. Here are the mechanisms of 'death by old age' if/when cancer
<br>
and heart disease are eliminated:
<br>
<p>1. NON-early onset Alzheimer's
<br>
2. Exhaustion of pluripotent stem cells due to Hayflick limit
