When I took science and math classes, in high school, there were girls in the
<br>
highest math and chemistry classes, and with the best grade point averages, but
<br>
not physics.  It was mostly boys in my classes because they were the most
<br>
difficult classes to take concurrently, a couple guys had independent study, but
<br>
most people were in the regular college preparatory classes.  There was a girl in
<br>
the lower physics class who was well-liked, half the teachers were women.  Yo
<br>
Gibbs!  Heh heh heh.
<br>
<p>We talked about the kinds of stories you mention here, but not in the science and
<br>
math classes.

<em>&gt; &gt; The way I heard it, the Christians scraped Hypatia to death with oyster

<em>&gt; I think the science part of this sordid affair was not the deciding

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alexandria. Hypatia represented the still noticeable power of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seraphinum/Library, a stronghold of paganism. The newly appointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; archbishop Cyril got into a row with the prefect Orestes, who was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend of Hypatia. After her murder it became easier to shut down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seraphinum, and Cyril went on to become St. Cyril. Her murder served
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more political interests than any form of luddism, although some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bishops evidently disliked her research as being ungodly.
