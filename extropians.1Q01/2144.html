Yes my literary comprehension skills are quite lacking.  I read it wrong
<br>
and realized this quickly after sending my post.  Sorry for wasting
<br>
bandwidth, and wouldn't have done so again if it weren't for a little
<br>
comment on the responses.  
<br>
<p>We cannot resolve anything visually to atomic levels.  The human eye is
<br>
sensitive down to about 15 photons resolution, and only in a really dark
<br>
atmosphere.  Albiet this probably doesn't matter if the computer screen
<br>
analogy holds with larger than pixel objects at large distances which was
<br>
referred to in a different response.
<br>
<p>I know a few particularly useless artists that I am currently setting to
<br>
work on verifying this with paint, and if there's any surprising results,
<br>
we'll get digital photos of it.
