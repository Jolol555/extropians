I see that our press release finally made it out, delayed by a couple
<br>
of months for some strange reason. This was written in November,
<br>
before we acquired our measurements, and the data is, simply, great.

<p>Cassini and Galileo spacecraft analyse volcanic ashes at Jupiter
<br>
<p>In December 2000, when NASA's Cassini spacecraft will pass by Jupiter,
<br>
scientists from the Max Planck Institut für Kernphysik in Heidelberg,
<br>
Germany, will analyse microscopic ash particles from volcanoes on the
<br>
giant planet's satellite Io. It will be the first in-situ analysis of surface
<br>
material from a planetary satellite of our solar system other than the
<br>
Earth's moon.
<br>
<p>On 30 December 2000 NASA's Cassini spacecraft, on its journey to
<br>
Saturn, will pass by the giant planet Jupiter. Another NASA spacecraft --
<br>
Galileo -- has been exploring Jupiter since 1995. From different vantage
<br>
points both spacecraft will study Jupiter, its satellites and its huge
<br>
magnetosphere in a joint observation campaign between October
<br>
2000 and March 2001. This is the first time that two spacecraft
<br>
simultaneously investigate the same gas giant planet from a close
<br>
distance.
<br>
<p>Cassini and Galileo have highly sensitive instruments for the analysis
<br>
of microscopic dust particles on board which were built by the
<br>
Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik in Heidelberg, Germany. The
<br>
Max-Planck scientists will study streams of ash particles, finer than
<br>
cigarette smoke, originating from volcanic plumes on Jupiter's moon Io.
<br>
Patterns in the streams as they pass one spacecraft first, then the
<br>
other, could give information about the particles' movement. These
<br>
streams can serve as a monitor of Io's plume activity. Identification
<br>
of the particles' composition would be sampling Io's surface material.
<br>
<p>Io is the only moon in the solar system with presently active volcanism,
<br>
being volcanically more active than the Earth. &quot;The volcanic ash particles
<br>
released from Io are accelerated to speeds of 300 km/sec by Jupiter's
<br>
magnetic field,&quot; said Prof. Eberhard Grün, leader of the joint
<br>
Cassini/Galileo dust investigations. &quot;By measuring the particles' flight
<br>
time between the two spacecraft which are more than 20 times the
<br>
Earth-moon distance apart we can directly measure their speed. The
<br>
particles are 4000 times faster than formula 1 world championship
<br>
winner Michael Schumacher in his racing car. Only because the particles
<br>
are so small (a thousandth of the thickness of a human hair) can they
<br>
gain such high speeds in Jupiter's magnetosphere,&quot; explains Grün.
<br>
<p>&quot;With our Galileo dust instrument we have seen a surprisingly large
<br>
amount of dust while Galileo was 20 million kilometers (50 times the
<br>
Earth-moon distance) away from Jupiter in September this year,&quot;
<br>
explains Dr Harald Krüger, leader of the dust investigations with Galileo.
<br>
&quot;If matter gets dispersed in space you usually expect more material to
<br>
be close to the source than far away, just like water released from a
<br>
hose is dispersed. We measured exactly the opposite which tells us
<br>
that the particles accumulate due to the interaction of Jupiter's
<br>
magnetosphere and the interplanetary magnetic field, a fact which
<br>
we do not understand yet.&quot;
<br>
<p>Furthermore, during the past five years of the Galileo dust exploration
<br>
in the Jupiter system, large variations in the detected amount of
<br>
dust have been found which could be due to changes in the Jovian
<br>
magnetosphere, or to variations in the dust production of Io's
<br>
volcanoes, or both. &quot;If we better understand the movement of the
<br>
dust particles in the magnetosphere we can use our dust measurements
<br>
to monitor Io's volcanic activity,&quot; said Eberhard Grün. &quot;Our joint
<br>
Cassini/Galileo measurements can be a major step forward towards
<br>
understanding these effects.&quot;
<br>
<p>Large amounts of dust were also recognized with the Cassini dust
<br>
instrument even further away from Jupiter. &quot;In September this year
<br>
we have measured the first dust particles from Io while Cassini was
<br>
still 45 million kilometers away from Jupiter,&quot; explains Ralf Srama,
<br>
responsible for the Cassini dust instrument. &quot;By analysing the dust
<br>
grains millions of kilometers away from Io we can analyse the moon's
<br>
surface composition. Our Cassini measurements have confirmed that
<br>
the particle composition resembles that of Io's surface.&quot;
<br>
<p>With the Galileo dust detector various types of dust grains have
<br>
been found throughout the Jupiter system: the planet's moons are
<br>
surrounded by faint clouds of dust particles ejected from the moons'
<br>
surface by impacts of interplanetary meteoroids. The planet itself
<br>
is surrounded by a dusty ring system, part of which can be seen
<br>
on images taken with large Earth-based telescopes. Only with the
<br>
continuous Galileo dust measurements going on for five years now
<br>
could Io be identified as the source of the ash particles detected
<br>
even in interplanetary space 300 million kilometers (750 times the
<br>
Earth-moon distance) away from Jupiter. More is presently known
<br>
about cosmic dust in Jupiter's system than about natural (i.e.
<br>
non-artificial) dust in the Earth environment.
<br>
<p>In interstellar space, stars and planets form out of clouds of gas and
<br>
dust permeated by magnetic fields. Since Io's dust particles behave
<br>
like ions in a magnetic field, the Jovian system can serve as a
<br>
laboratory for studying the processes of star and planet formation.
<br>
With their dust detector on board ESA's Ulysses spacecraft, the
<br>
scientists from Heidelberg successfully identified and analysed
<br>
interstellar dust sweeping through our solar system. Due to their
<br>
high speeds, the Io particles eventually become interstellar dust.
<br>
<p>Only with the highly sensitive dust detectors on board Cassini and
<br>
Galileo which measure dust grains hitting a 1000 cm2 metal target,
<br>
could these particles be detected. In the case of the Io particles the
<br>
dust concentration is so low that only one grain can be found in a cube
<br>
with about 3 meters on a side. Although these ash particles are very
<br>
interesting scientifically, they do not cause a danger to spacecraft.
<br>
<p>The Cassini and Galileo dust instruments were built by an international
<br>
team of scientists and engineers under the leadership of Prof. Dr.
<br>
Eberhard Grün at the Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik in Heidelberg,
<br>
Germany, with financial support from the German national space agency
<br>
(DLR).
<br>
<p>The Cassini and Galileo programs are international cooperative efforts
<br>
involving NASA, ESA and several European academic and industrial
<br>
contributors. Galileo has been orbiting Jupiter since December 1995,
<br>
and has currently completed five very successful years of exploring
<br>
the Jupiter system. Cassini/Huygens will reach Saturn in 2004 and
<br>
explore the second-largest planet of our solar system and its satellites
<br>
during a four-year orbital mission. Cassini's Huygens probe was built by
<br>
ESA and will descend into the atmosphere of Titan, the largest of the
<br>
Saturnian moons. Galileo and Cassini are operated by the Jet Propulsion
<br>
Laborary which is a division of Caltech, Pasadena, CA.
