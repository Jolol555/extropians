<p>You missed a subsidiary use for it: enforcement and expansion of
<br>
domestic surveillance facilities into the international arena,
<br>
and a useful stick with which to beat foreign governments into
<br>
cooperation. In the absence of a credible superpower threat, it's
<br>
interesting to see NSA and CIA attempts to justify their existence
<br>
by offering support for the war on drugs: an identical phenomenon
<br>
is occuring in the UK (with GCHQ and SIS turning their attention to
<br>
drug smuggling). And then there was the invasion of Panama and the
<br>
arrest of General Noriega on drugs charges -- a rather interesting
<br>
way of dealing with a foreign head of state, that.
<br>
<p>Basically, the WOD is facilitating the construction of a planet-wide
<br>
policing and surveillance system that can bypass local legal standards
<br>
and bring an astonishing amount of force to bear. 
<br>
<p>(Any analogies to The Emergency in Vinge's &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot;
<br>
will be applauded.)
