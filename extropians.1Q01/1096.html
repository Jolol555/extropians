Why did Sci Fi fail to miss all the important developments of the future?
<br>
And analysis, etc...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From (this URL may be in 2 pieces):
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://globalarchive.ft.com/globalarchive/articles.html?id=010106001370&query=kubrick">http://globalarchive.ft.com/globalarchive/articles.html?id=010106001370&query=kubrick</a>
<br>
<p>An excerpt:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
But why was the renascence of a red-blooded, fundamentalist capitalism not 
<br>
foreseen? Why, indeed, did Huxley in Brave New World (1932), Orwell in 
<br>
Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and Clarke and Kubrick in A Space Odyssey (1968) 
<br>
have so little to say about economics, given its centrality to human life? 
<br>
Why, in effect, did they assume that technology or planning would take care 
<br>
of economic issues?
<br>
<p>The answer, I think, is that none of them imagined that the clock could be 
<br>
turned back. Converts to the market often imagine they are embracing a new 
<br>
philosophy. In reality, they are old fogies who are uncritically recycling 
<br>
ideas first popular in the 17th and 18th centuries.
<br>
<p>That was the era when the leading philosophers, influenced by Newton's 
<br>
mechanistic physics, created the myth of the atomistic individual that 
<br>
undergirds the market ideology. The intellectual history of the 19th and 
<br>
early 20th centuries is largely one of a heroic struggle to demonstrate the 
<br>
flaws in that superficially appealing story.
<br>
<p>[Comment: is randism et al supported by the hardwired respect we as social 
<br>
animals have for the alpha beast? Hero worship etc ...]
<br>
<p>Huxley and the others never conceived that politicians would again become 
<br>
slavish adherents to a framework of ideas that had been found wanting by 
<br>
leading philosophers and sociologists.
<br>
<p>Taking the long view, they were probably right, which is not to say that 
<br>
their totalitarian fantasies were realistic. Our ultra- individualistic, 
<br>
market-led society is probably a historical aberration. It will evolve into 
<br>
something different (dare I say something more advanced?), even if we avoid 
<br>
an economic or environmental calamity.
<br>
<p>Looking forward 50 or 100 years I find it hard to imagine that societies 
<br>
will continue to place so much confidence in brash young traders and 
<br>
round-the-clock casino-style financial markets. I doubt they will accept our 
<br>
wealth differentials or the psychological stress and social upheaval 
<br>
generated by unrestrained competition.
<br>
<p>If I believed there were any point in futurology, I would predict a more 
<br>
sane, stable and just form of social organisation. There is something called 
<br>
progress and we won't be constrained by an 18th century template forever.
