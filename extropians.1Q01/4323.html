<em>&gt; Ridicule is a powerful emotional tool, and has been used with great effect

<em>&gt; to denigrate and marginalize cryonics.  But its application is also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy which, when confronted with an appropriate counter-strategy, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backfire.  Would attorneys, faced with sizeable damage claims, be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complacent?  Perhaps.  But they would certainly consider the overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context, a context which would, at least at first, be set by the attorneys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the plaintiffs.
</em><br>
<p>Umm...no.  It'd be set at first by whichever side the media sides with
<br>
by default.  And given as genuine (or, at least, no-large-following and
<br>
no-reproducible-results) crackpots tend to pester the media enough that
<br>
the media are chronically tired and suspicious of those who look like
<br>
crackpots...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider the following, which I wrote for a recent post to the cryonet:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When making your case for cryonics, don't fail to mention the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential for reducing human suffering.  Not only will ALL the depredations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of disease, injury, and aging be brought to a frozen standstill to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patiently await a reliably more favorable outcome (Contingent of course on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful reanimation.  I won't go into here why I believe SUCCESS IS A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NEAR CERTAINTY.), but the benefits extend to every one of the everyday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who then get to live in a world of vastly diminished human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Extraordiary claims require extraordinary proof.&quot;  I believe that cryo
<br>
is more likely than not to suceed, but its proof is more theoretical
<br>
than historical at this point.  Frankly, cold fusion has more
<br>
demonstrated laboratory evidence than cryo as of right now, at least to
<br>
my knowledge.  Reasonable skepticism to the point of ignoring it will
<br>
remain valid for doctors until several people are awakened from cryo -
<br>
and that is the point this lawsuit would be contesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And don't forget the children.  I don't know about you, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know of nothing in the world more heart-rending than the horror of children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with cancer, surrounded by caregivers and family, who, themselves in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utmost torment, have to pretend, for the sake of the kids, that life is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a howling tragedy.  Remember the kids!]
</em><br>
<p>...which might just work, if politicians hadn't already been milking
<br>
&quot;for the chiiiiildrun&quot; for long enough that a number of people (at
<br>
least that I've heard from) are volunteering that they're sick of it,
<br>
and automatically cast any such tactic as suspicion of hiding the facts
<br>
behind an emotional facade.  (&quot;Let's wage war on drugs for the
<br>
chiiiiildrun.  Let's censor the Internet for the chiiiiildrun.  Let's
<br>
do all kinds of pork projects in my district for the chiiiiildrun.&quot;)
<br>
If this is actively showing, there may be a deeper not-mentioned
<br>
resentment of that angle amongst the public.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the case is built on the reduction of human suffering, and you show the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faces of all those kids (not to mention all the other faces of suffering),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the defense team tries to belittle you, and ridicule you, they might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very well come off as heartless monsters.  This sort of appeal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudicial emotionalism might be controllable in the courtroom, but not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the court of public opinion.  The media would eat it up.  They would like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing more than to play every angle for maximum air time (ie maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profit).  The crank cryonicists angle would certainly be appealing.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what about the rich heartless doctors and blood sucking lawyers as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; villians vs the white knight cryonicists defending the tragically suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children et al?  Which high drama makes the media cash registers ring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer more fiercely?
</em><br>
<p>Umm...and how, exactly, do doctors and lawyers benefit from not even
<br>
mentioning cryo?  It's more or less orthogonal to their bottom line,
<br>
unless they're getting kickbacks from funeral directors (who could just
<br>
as easily hold funerals for people going into cryo - after all, the
<br>
bodies are just as dead, the only question is whether this is a
<br>
permanent state).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tricky stuff this.  You make the call.
</em><br>
<p>One thing that helps in these situations: put yourself in the position
<br>
of your enemy.  (Not the position you would like your enemy to assume,
<br>
but the position they are actually in.  I find this very tough for most
<br>
people to do, since it requires a degree of intellectual honesty that
<br>
is simply unnecessary in most peoples' day-to-day lives.  I find it
<br>
useful for this, for myself, to use the term &quot;enemy&quot; since I know that
<br>
my enemies' objectives rarely have anything to do with my own except by
<br>
the coincidence that places them in opposition to me, but your mileage
<br>
may vary.)  Once in that position, judge what the best counters to
<br>
each of your proposed tactics is.  This can identify weak strategies,
<br>
but it can - sometimes - also reveal ways to alter the conflict such
<br>
that your enemy becomes your ally.
<br>
<p>For instance: how about short-term cryo for people who are critically
<br>
injured and would die before they reach the hospital, but who might
<br>
possibly be saved once at the hospital if their tissues could be kept
<br>
from degenerating?  If that could be developed and proven, it would
<br>
automatically validate the case for long-term cryo, quite possibly to
<br>
the point where doctors *would* become legally negligent for not
<br>
mentioning this possibility.  Would Alcor or any of the other cryo
<br>
companies be interested in R&amp;Ding this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks Adrian.
</em><br>
<p>No prob.
