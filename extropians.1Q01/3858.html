<p>Unfortunately, demographics are against you. (I'm assuming you're
<br>
male.)  Based on anecdotal evidence, the Extropy Institute membership
<br>
draws heavily from several populations with high male/female ratios:  IT
<br>
professionals, scientists, libertarians.
<br>
<p>IT professionals: &lt; 30% female
<br>
libertarians: &lt;20% female
<br>
scientists: depends on field; high female %'s in biology, social
<br>
sciences, low female %'s in physics, engineering, and chemistry.
<br>
<p>Percentages are from memory, but I think are roughly accurate.  I would
<br>
be surprised if more than 10% of Extropy Institute's members were
<br>
female.
<br>
<p>Some suggestions:
<br>
<p>1.  You may try Science Connect
<br>
(<a href="http://www.sciconnect.com/overview.html">http://www.sciconnect.com/overview.html</a>) a not-for-profit dating
<br>
service for individuals with an interest in science or nature.  They
<br>
charge $110 Canadian/$80 U.S. for annual membership.  Members receive
<br>
monthly mailings with member profiles.  I haven't tried them myself, but
<br>
they've been around for several years, and judging from the web site,
<br>
they look pretty reputable.
<br>
<p>2.  Read David Buss's _Evolution of Desire_ for an excellent summary of
<br>
what the opposite sex is likely to find attractive.  Here's an excerpt:
<br>
<p>&quot;The importance of resources to attraction is not limited to Western
<br>
cultures. Among the Siriono of eastern Bolivia, one man
<br>
who was a particularly unsuccessful hunter and had lost several wives to
<br>
men who were better hunters suffered a loss of status
<br>
within the group. The anthropologist A. R. Holmberg began hunting with
<br>
this man, gave him game that others were told he had
<br>
killed, and taught him the art of killing game with a shotgun.
<br>
Eventually, as a result of the man's increased hunting prowess, he
<br>
'was enjoying the highest status, had acquired several new sex partners,
<br>
and was insulting others, instead of being insulted by
<br>
them.'&quot; (pg. 101)
<br>
<p>Too bad alien anthropologists are unlikely to descend from the skies and
<br>
shower gold coins upon you, but maybe you can find some useful tips
<br>
nonetheless.  You may also find some useful stuff in the Evolution of
<br>
Desire FAQ:
<br>
<a href="http://www.clark.net/pub/ogas/evolution/FAQ_evolution_of_desire.html">http://www.clark.net/pub/ogas/evolution/FAQ_evolution_of_desire.html</a>
<br>
<p>3.  For inspiration, read Philip Greenspun's Using the Internet to Pick
<br>
Up Babes/Hunks at  (<a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/getting-dates">http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/getting-dates</a>) about
<br>
one man's (ultimately successful) efforts to find a mate via the
<br>
Internet.
<br>
<p>&quot;...Email did start to trickle in. Some were thoughtful missives from
<br>
women. It wasn't clear that they were interested in romance but at least
<br>
they seemed interested in a conversation. Unfortunately, two factors
<br>
were working against me. First, I was too busy with my existing friends
<br>
to have deep conversations with strangers. Second, I got my current
<br>
email address back in 1976 which is also about when I formed my
<br>
composite image of the average Internet user. In 1976, the Internet was
<br>
being used by computer programmers. Computer programmers do not tend to
<br>
be especially attractive people. There weren't a whole lot of women on
<br>
the Net in 1976 but I don't seem to remember them being any better
<br>
looking than the guys. I may look like a wreck myself with my sagging
<br>
flesh and fluorescent tan but after watching 97,000 hours of network
<br>
television, I feel entitled to a life partner who looks like Christie
<br>
Brinkley.
<br>
<p>For every email message I got from a straight woman, there would be one
<br>
message from a gay man. Reflecting the exquisite subtlety and sense for
<br>
nuance that one can only acquire by being born an American male, these
<br>
were more direct. Still, I was even less enthusiastic about these
<br>
messages than I had been about those from women....&quot;
<br>
<p>4.  Attend Extro 5!  Your odds of meeting a compatible female will
<br>
increase a great deal.  Also try the Alcor Technology Conference,
<br>
Foresight Conferences, Institute for Objectivist Study conferences, etc.
<br>
<p>5.  Meanwhile, you can commiserate with similarly lonely (if for
<br>
different reasons) individuals at the Involuntary Celibacy website at
<br>
(<a href="http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~ad097/ic-home.html">http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~ad097/ic-home.html</a>).   Or you may decide
<br>
the true path to enlightenment requires eschewing desire altogether.
