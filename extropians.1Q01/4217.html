idea
<br>
<em>&gt; in my mind: So long as people have reproductive freedom, there is no check

</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't worry too much about this. There is another major cost in raising
<br>
a child beside money, and that is in time (yes, I know it's naughty to
<br>
equate time with money, but I do feel that it is a limited resource!). I
<br>
don't see an income floor increasing the amount of time available to people.
<br>
<p>As a tradeoff to the possible problems, it'd be pretty nice to live in a
<br>
society where the impetus for petty crime had been removed. And for begging,
<br>
and for all other kinds of poverty-related social problems. It may very well
<br>
stimulate inovation if handled carefully, too; it's easier to consider
<br>
trying the trapese when you have a safety net. I think societies without
<br>
income safety nets of some kind may often lead to a lot of risk-averse
<br>
behaviour; that is, extreme conservatism.
<br>
<p>Also, I think the trends are that as people become more educated and
<br>
wealthier, they have less kids. An income floor might just free some people
<br>
up to become more educated, and will make the ones you are worrying about
<br>
wealthier. This doesn't seem to lead logically to increase in birth rates.
<br>
<p>I think education is a key issue, if you are worried about birth rates. Not
<br>
education about birth control, mind you; general education. If we can use
<br>
the newfound wealth of our higher-tech society of the future to increase
<br>
average educational levels, the problem of overpopulation will likely be
<br>
reduced. Plus, there might be more interesting people to talk to! Like
<br>
Windows 95: you'll be able to do more, and it'll be more fun. (sorry, just
<br>
installed 95 on an old machine, it says that during the install; I couldn't
<br>
resist).
<br>
<p>I have a feeling that the overpopulation problem might usefully have the
<br>
skyscraper analogy applied, as presented by Damien with respect to arguments
<br>
against life extension:
<br>
<p>&quot;True in a way. But this entire argument is wrong-headed. It's like the case
<br>
that could have been made during most of human history against the
<br>
possibility of skyscrapers. You just can't build that tall - the mud will
<br>
crumble under compressive forces, no matter how much straw you mix with it.
<br>
And even if you could find a miracle building material, all the upper
<br>
floors would be taken up by staircases, and anyway nobody is fit enough to
<br>
climb to the 80th floor and down again every day. Then along comes steel
<br>
and electricity and the elevator. &quot;
<br>
<p>What's coming along to turn overpopulation into plain old population?
<br>
Filtering seawater into drinkable water? Cheap earth to orbit transport, and
<br>
space bubble habitats made out of a dissassembled Mars (credit to Robert for
<br>
that one, of course)? Maybe mass uploading, with a couple of trillion people
<br>
fitting in a box the size of a PDA? Or something (or a combination of
<br>
things) even weirder?
<br>
<p>I'm sure there'll be some combination of insights, advances, and truly
<br>
lateral thinking, which circumvents the bulk of this problem before it hits.
<br>
Could be a rough ride between then and now, of course, but that would be
<br>
life.
