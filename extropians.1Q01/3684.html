<p><em>&gt;I think it's an emotional reaction people have to the very idea of

</em><br>
<p>What it comes down to is marketing; while a lot of the more scientifically-
<br>
minded individuals often dismiss marketing and public reaction as a
<br>
secondary concern, it is probably as important as the science itself.
<br>
Regardless, there will always be a large number of people opposed to
<br>
certain forms of technology such as cryonics, but to what extent this
<br>
opposition is based upon misunderstanding and misinterpretation is
<br>
something that we *can* affect.  It is also something I may have the
<br>
opportunity to do personally within the next year.
<br>
<p>How we, as extropians are perceived and how individual technologies are
<br>
perceived is mutable, and all it takes is a bit of organization and
<br>
financial support to alter that perception to some degree.
<br>
<p>Currently, with the concept of cryonics, the knee-jerk reaction is
<br>
generally that of being viewed as &quot;science-fiction,&quot; &quot;unethical,&quot; or &quot;too
<br>
expensive.&quot;  While the middle one of those three reactions is the toughest
<br>
to argue, factual representation of the former and the latter to various
<br>
media can surely augment public opinion to some extent.  It is simply a
<br>
case of getting the correct information out to the right people.  Perhaps
<br>
that is easier said than done, but I have yet to see it convincingly
<br>
attempted.
<br>
<p>By the way, I did not see the ABC news story on cryonics, so my apologies
<br>
if some of my above comments are redundant.
