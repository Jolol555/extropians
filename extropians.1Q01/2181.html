</em><br>
<p>Your search for certainty is laudable but unreliable: it boils down to
<br>
just another expression of the religiosity that infuses American culture.
<br>
<p>The universe doesn't owe us a living. The wave front from a [hypothetical,
<br>
I hope!] gamma ray burster five hundred light years away may reach us
<br>
tomorrow and exterminate every species on the planet -- just as other
<br>
GRBs suffice to sweep the universe of life periodically. If that were to
<br>
happen, what, then, would the whole of human existence signify?
<br>
<p>Sweet fuck-all, that's what.
<br>
<p>Contemplating such possibilities is distinctly unpleasant to us, because
<br>
as a species we are survival-oriented. As Richard Dawkins observed, we
<br>
-- and every other organism on the planet -- are descended from a three
<br>
billion year long family tree of winners. Those branches that didn't try
<br>
to win hard enough got pruned. It would be surprising if we could confront
<br>
the possibility of our own extinction with equanimity, wouldn't it?
<br>
<p>So let's try to derive a concept of rights from this mess ...
<br>
<p>To start with, all I know is that, pace Descartes, &quot;I think -- therefore
<br>
someone is&quot;. (For all I know I'm a simulation in some corner of a much
<br>
smarter being's mind, so I can't simply settle for the traditional
<br>
&quot;cogito, ergo sum&quot;.) I also know that I want to continue thinking and,
<br>
preferably, receiving external stimuli that are compatible with my
<br>
continuing to do so.
<br>
<p>Solipsism might seem like a rational viewpoint at this stage, but it's
<br>
by no means necessary: I know that _I_ exist, I perceive that you match
<br>
my internal model of how a human being might think and communicate,
<br>
therefore by Occam's razor it's simplest to conclude that I am just one
<br>
of a class of entities, and you are another. So I'm not alone.
<br>
<p>By Occam's razor I can also assume that you posess the same core
<br>
motivation as I do -- to continue thinking and interacting with your
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>Our environment lets us do many wonderful, if stupid, things that appear
<br>
to challenge our continued ability to think -- things like jumping off
<br>
tall buildings without a parachute, swallowing weedkiller, or shaving
<br>
with a chainsaw. So I don't do those things. I assume you don't want to
<br>
do those things, either.
<br>
<p>More importantly, I assume you don't want *me* to do those things to
<br>
*you* -- and this is a mutual relationship (no, I do not want Michael
<br>
Lorrey to try to shave me with a chainsaw).
<br>
<p>Among rational beings -- and I will credit you with rationality until
<br>
contradicting evidence emerges -- two-way communications are possible. Let
<br>
us posit a universe populated by Michael Lorry and Charlie Stross. I 
<br>
propose to you, &quot;I will undertake not to kill you, if you provide me with
<br>
an identical undertaking.&quot; Well okay, we might shake hands on the deal,
<br>
but what if one of us does so insincerely?
<br>
<p>At this point, we expand the universe to include Everybody Else. The
<br>
agreement becomes multiway, and requires everybody to agree that, &quot;I, the
<br>
undersigned, promise not to kill any other party to this agreement without
<br>
their express prior written permission&quot; (or words to that effect), with
<br>
a rider: &quot;further to this, if another party to this agreement violates it
<br>
with respect to a third party, I am prepared to come to the third party's
<br>
aid.&quot;
<br>
<p>What we have here is enforceability: if I go bananas and try to push
<br>
Michael Lorrey off a tall building, everyone else who's signed on to
<br>
our social contract is required to come to his aid. (And vice versa if
<br>
the roles are reversed.)
<br>
<p>At this point, we can talk of a right to life, which imposes an
<br>
equivalent duty of intervention on society at large, of which we are all
<br>
members. (Society at large is the set of all those people who signed
<br>
the mutual non-murder pact.) Yes, we now have an obligation. But we
<br>
also have some collective security. The security breaks down if people
<br>
begin to disregard the obligation imposed in return for their right;
<br>
it's not an absolute right to life. But it's one that doesn't rely on
<br>
appeals to numinous truth, the laws of physics (which may be merely the
<br>
figments of some a-life researcher's imagination, and us the victims of
<br>
a cruel jape), and so on.
<br>
<p>We can extrapolate a shitload of comparable rights from the core, golden
<br>
rule: &quot;do unto others as you would be done by&quot;. These are not cheap
<br>
rights -- each of them costs us some sort of obligation, although the
<br>
obligation may be discharged collectively (&quot;society&quot; pays some of its
<br>
members to carry a badge and police the mutual non-murder pact). We also
<br>
have a problem: this is not an ideal world, nobody gave me a contract
<br>
of rights to sign when I was younger, and many people don't realise that
<br>
rights need to be enforced. Other people seem to believe that a bunch of
<br>
delegates can vote for a new right (&quot;the right to a moon made of green
<br>
cheese&quot;) and it will magically appear overhead.
<br>
<p>The main point is to get away from magical thinking about rights --
<br>
that they exist in majestic splendour as some sort of emergent feature
<br>
of the human condition, which itself is fixed and unchangeable -- and
<br>
recognize that they're conditional on us defending them, and can apply
<br>
to other classes of beings (as long as they can agree to abide by them).
<br>
<p>It's the magical thinking about rights, and the inane insistence that
<br>
an eighteenth century document with some nineteenth century amendments
<br>
is the ultimate definition of human nature, that gets up the noses of
<br>
us Europeans (who've lived through a century in which our conception of
<br>
rights, and the need to defend them, had to be reconstructed very painfully
<br>
from the wreckage of a misguided attempt to do away with them completely).
