<p>That's a rather strange thing to say. Nuke power has its niches, but
<br>
most of them lie outside of this gravity well. And since launches are
<br>
notoriously unreliable, one has to construct them outside. Pu is not
<br>
Andromeda strain, but I'd rather not have few extra tons of Pu encased
<br>
in slowly corroding structures the bottom of the oceans.

jar money. (I'd wish).

<p>Never mind electrocorrosion.

<p><em>&gt; that swing back and forth.  As the ocean current flows through, which it regularly

<p>There's a lot of energy in the tides and the surf, but the energy density,
<br>
especially peak energy density, does not make this a viable, practical option.
<br>
At least with our current materials, and means of engineering. Not to mention
<br>
coarse grain/high installation threshold.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; an algae bank above it in a bubble growing methane and burning it there for power

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Seaborne structures are notoriously problematic, really. And if you're into
<br>
biomass for energy (why on earth? it doesn't make sense even for resources
<br>
as long as our fossils are not completely depleted), why nonaquatic biomass?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Some people have states ideas of beaming power from space.  The way this happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that power is generated on the lit side of the moon using solar cells.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is beamed using high-power microwaves to those areas in the line of sight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where it is required.  Drawback:  misaligned microwave cooks area.
</em><br>
<p>Photovoltaical satellites are actually great, the problem is that you can't
<br>
make them from terrestrial material as long as the launch costs and ecological
<br>
impacts of launches stay within an order of magnitude of state of the art (to
<br>
break this mere economies of scale won't do). So you have to wait for this 
<br>
until you can mine the Moon (NEA have to much delta vee and too much latency 
<br>
for teleoperation to be for much use). So there's a very high technological 
<br>
threshold for that scheme, as seen from here and now (Jan 2001).
<br>
<p>Btw: if you look at the power density, it is not an issue. But you *could*
<br>
focus the power to high fluxes for special uses, for instance such as a 
<br>
missile shield (or nuking cities instead of just lunch). But of course the 
<br>
problem set shifts when your tech is high enough to have that much 
<br>
hardware in the sky. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We're talking about electrical equipment, I wonder what the order is in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption of these products:  green pc, green monitor, iron, electric stovetop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range, electric furnace, stereo, large television, 100W light bulb, dishwasher,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microwave.  These are some typical home products.
</em><br>
<p>I think an order of magnitude improvement on power consumption to a typical
<br>
U.S. household should be very attainable without paying a too hefty toll.
<br>
The first thing to start with would do with insulation, passive solar and
<br>
heat exchangers in the ventilation pathways. But currently fossils are too
<br>
cheap for that, at least in the U.S.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The price cap on power sounds kind of socialist or fascist.  It could probably use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some reregulation.
</em><br>
<p>I think we should develop a more pragmatic attitude: whatever makes sense
<br>
(on the *long* run) should gets done, whatever the motivation. Free markets
<br>
or state regulations should be used, whatever fits best for the current task.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think if the use nuclear power were tripled or perhaps quadrupled in the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States, and the rollout of superconductor in products and local links to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency were done, then there would be a better situation.
</em><br>
<p>As long as we don't have practical room temperature superconductors their
<br>
use is utterly nonviable. In any case, I'm rather fond of micrograin/grassroot
<br>
solutions to the faux &quot;energy crisis&quot;, because it shifts the power balance
<br>
to individuals and small groups of individuals. In a cliche, power to the people.
<br>
<p>Nukes are really really a nonsolution to a nonproblem at best, a problem
<br>
on their own at worst.
