</em><br>
<p>Depends how you define 'progress'. And on the ability to selectively
<br>
ignore the necessary prerequisites for those 'creative and energetic
<br>
people' to do their things. Behind every aerospace engineer or chip
<br>
designer there's a small army of people working supermarket checkouts and
<br>
farms and food factories (so the engineers don't have to hunt their food
<br>
every day with a flint spear), valeting maintaining and manufacturing
<br>
their cars (so the engineers don't have to walk to work every day),
<br>
building houses and mowing their lawns for them, and so on. These people
<br>
are not clearly part of the creative process -- but without them, there
<br>
couldn't be a creative process because the creative person would be too
<br>
bloody busy staying alive to get creating.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this viewpoint, being creative and innovative is merely a
</em><br>
specialisation, of no more importance to the running of things than
<br>
being paid to clean toilets for a living.
<br>
<p>I've noticed a tendency of people on this list -- and of libertarians
<br>
in general -- to flatter themselves with the idea that they belong to
<br>
some tiny elite, buried in the seething masses, who actually make
<br>
things work and civlization progress. Well, it might be true -- and
<br>
that might be a pig I see through my study window, on final approach 
<br>
into Turnhouse airport. Folks, we *are* those masses. Doesn't matter
<br>
if most of them are dumb as a plank; we're still related.
<br>
<p>I figure that if you want to set ethical goals for extropians, taking
<br>
those dumb-as-a-plank people and helping them learn to *think* would
<br>
be a good starting point for activism. Denying that they're *capable*
<br>
of thought is actually a first step down another road -- one that leads
<br>
to a hereditary aristocracy or a caste system.
