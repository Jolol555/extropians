<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Linux is very nice but it is a tool somebody has made so they don't have to

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; pay for the tools from other. Free hammers would also be nice for the

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; carpentry business but would destroy the hammer business. So you can turn it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; around and say that if people want free music they should make it themself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just like the Linux crowd supposedly does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Here is the difference, about the software/hammer analogy.  Making two copies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a software is a marginal action.  Making two copies of a hammer requires twice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the quantities the comprise the hammer.  Also, making a hammer requires forging,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; casting, or machining the hammer head and possibly the handle, or carving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; handle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, both software and hammer have start-up costs, the software's fixed costs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being the programming time and code and test platforms which are mostly reused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or reusable, while the hammer has the fixed costs of the machines and tools to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make the hammer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; After the fixed costs, reproducing software is basically a costless operation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I see those as obvious statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take printed material, like a book. I can cut off the binder and feed it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a Docutech scanner and reproduce as many as I want for only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple bucks each. Should I be able to do that? How about once I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scanned it in (which only takes a couple minutes of time) I send it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my workstation and have the scanned pages OCR'ed. I can now send that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book anywhere. Have I broken any laws? Its easy to reproduce that book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now for nothing, and I don't need to mess with printing costs, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A book is a media delivery format, just like a disk.  Its content is covered by fair
<br>
use and other copyright laws.  If it's your personal copy of your book you can do with
<br>
it as you please as long as you take reasonable measures in good faith to preserve the
<br>
fair use and copyrights, barring alternative agreement..
<br>
<p>Now, if you have one scanner and printer, each hardware, if you want another of each
<br>
then that requires duplicate physical resources and manufacturing capability.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Linux or the other free UNIXs were not free, they are made from thousands upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thousands of programmer hours and precursor code, they were just freely given.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is a concept of sum societal utility.  Linux, free, has contributed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sum societal utility many times over its investment given by volunteer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; programmers and supporters, some might say.  Some statistics have it running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; half the Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except that linux is NOT free. It typically is sold on CD-ROM for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $40-80, which is little different from other operating systems. Can I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce a Redhat CD-ROM and sell them for a buck if I want to? No, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Anyone can acquire the Linux kernel and many programs for it for free and start their
<br>
own Linux strain, and distribute it for any cost they care to charge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Copyright laws are in place for a reason, and most of them are good laws.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; patent laws, in my opinion, are cumbersome and infringe upon the growth of sum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; societal utility, and any patent should expire in twelve years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given Moore's Law, most any patent on computer related items issued at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time of its technological and economical applicability has only an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 18 month window of marketablity.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  When we were examining the copyright statutes before, I noticed that
<br>
there are specific concerns of the semiconductor industry addressed therein.
<br>
Considering any part of the von Neumann architecture (memory, bus, processor) I think
<br>
that no part of it is patented, yet specific chip designs and manufacturing methods
<br>
almost certainly have patents, and many are used throughout multiple generations of
<br>
processor and other hardware design architecture, which is largely quite beyond me
<br>
besides the use of layman terms and acquaintance of some EEE engineers.
<br>
<p>Here's a typical example of a &quot;bad&quot; patent: Lempel-Ziv-Welch dictionary stream
<br>
compression.  The patent on this method of compression, acquired ten or so years ago
<br>
by Unisys, was not enforced (coincidentally, unenforcement of copyright claims leads
<br>
them to be unenforceable) for several years as it became a commodity compression
<br>
method, and then it was, somehow, and became a barrier to entry to the use of that
<br>
simple algorithm.
<br>
<p>As far as I know, if a copyright claim is not made within a reasonable time from when
<br>
such claims would be valid, then they become invalid.  I can not say if that holds
<br>
true for patents, an arcane sector in need of retrofit.
