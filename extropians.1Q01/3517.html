Since we're going to merge with machines, let's have some friendly
<br>
machines to merge with.
<br>
<p>This Dyson machine mows, so you don't have to:

<p>Gecko Systems' CareBot
<br>
How the CareBot Can Care for your Most Precious
<br>
<a href="http://www.geckosystems.com/carebot/children.html">http://www.geckosystems.com/carebot/children.html</a>
<br>
In today's chaotic economy, it is all too common that the children will
<br>
get out of school before it is possible for you to leave work. This means
<br>
that they will come home to an empty house, and you will have no way of
<br>
knowing that they got home safely. The CareBot can help make sure that the
<br>
house is safe for them, and that they arrive at home when they should.
<br>
The CareBot can be set to monitor your house for intruders, making sure
<br>
that nobody is lurking inside, waiting for your children. When it is time
<br>
for the children to arrive at home, the CareBot can greet them at the door
<br>
and make sure that they arrive at the right time.
<br>
---------------
<br>
The clever thing about CareBot is that instead of having its own &quot;brain&quot;,
<br>
it taps the spare processing power of a PC via a wireless link. That means
<br>
the robot itself is cheap and light but can still access cutting-edge
<br>
computer chips. At the moment all CareBot can manage is a spot of
<br>
vacuuming, but Gecko Systems is teaching it other skills, including smoke
<br>
detection and plant watering. CareBot will soon get a vision system and
<br>
voice recognition software too, making it even more versatile. Add an
<br>
Inspector- Gadget-style arm that can pick up clothes, cans and books and
<br>
you're not that far from a butlerbot that can follow complex orders such
<br>
as &quot;take John a beer&quot;.
<br>
<p>Probotics' &quot;Cye&quot; Robot
<br>
<a href="http://www.techtv.com/freshgear/firstlook/story/0,23008,2374214,00.html">http://www.techtv.com/freshgear/firstlook/story/0,23008,2374214,00.html</a>
<br>
Now that the Digital Age is firmly upon us, where are all the robots we
<br>
envisioned twenty years ago? Will the likes of R2D2 merely live in the
<br>
annals of sci-fi lore? Not if Cye, the household robot from Probotics,
<br>
Inc., can help it.
<br>
Looking more like a handleless vacuum cleaner, the 16 by 10 by 5 inch Cye
<br>
is operated wirelessly by a PC and is programmable to handle a variety of
<br>
tasks, from serving drinks to vacuuming the carpet. The PC, using the
<br>
Windows-based Map-N-Zap software, communicates with the cog-wheeled droid
<br>
via a small antenna that connects to the serial port.
<br>
<p><p>Two legs better
<br>

<br>
IF YOU were expecting domestic robots to look something like C3PO, then
<br>
the reality--a glorified biscuit tin on wheels--is mighty disappointing.
<br>
It's also useless if you live in a house with stairs. But don't despair
<br>
just yet. Many roboticists expect that the first two-legged machines could
<br>
be striding about your home in just five years' time.
