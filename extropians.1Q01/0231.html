</em><br>
<em>&gt; this catch-all word &quot;physical&quot; ... none at all.
</em><br>
<p>No, it has some uses.  It has an intension as well as an extension.
<br>
&quot;Physical&quot; doesn't just describe the set of things which do exist, but
<br>
the set of things which could possibly exist.  It supports
<br>
counterfactuals, as they say.
<br>
<p>More to the point, it seems to be in opposition to theories like
<br>
yours.  If &quot;physical&quot; meant nothing, or everything, you should be able
<br>
to show that, under my own definition of &quot;physical,&quot; your theory is
<br>
physical.  But you can't do that.  You theory inherently relies on
<br>
non-physical elements.  (Yet you try to claim the scientific
<br>
high-ground and resort to name-calling with cries of &quot;medievalism.&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Well, my physicalism denies that symbols are anything more than their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical part.  e.g. Writing is nothing more than scratches on paper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So all scratches on paper ARE writing? Ridiculous!
</em><br>
<p>Forgive me.  Scratches on paper that are USED in a certain way by
<br>
people.  No non-physical component, unless you consider their use as a
<br>
kind of &quot;logical part,&quot; which is misleading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;My physicalism denies that there is some non-physical meaning-object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who apart from a philosopher would talk about &quot;meaning-object&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to deny straightforward &quot;meaning&quot; ... I bet you do not use this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; garbage-speech in normal conversation.
</em><br>
<p>I don't normally have conversations about physicalism.  But, I assure
<br>
you, whenever I do, I use these sorts of words and adopt this style of
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;which is out there somewhere, attached to the word.  The word has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;use, an effect on ourselves and others, but nothing more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not &quot;out there&quot; anywhere , this is just a lame assumption that everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is physical again .... ideas are properties of the mind (phantom pineal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye) so do not need physical extension.
</em><br>
<p>Properties of a non-physical object?  No good.  As far as I'm
<br>
concerned, ideas may be properties of physical objects, or
<br>
second-order properties of properties of physical objects, but at the
<br>
end of the day, it must be a physical property.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Yes.  Principles are arrays of physical symbols, which may be stored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in the physical brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have looked though the OED and other dictionaries to see if I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find anything like your description ... but, *no* ... surprise surprise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the accepted definitions are something like &quot;&quot;a source, root,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; origin: that which is fundamental: a theoretical basis: a faculty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind: a source of action:a fundamental truth on which others are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founded or from which they spring &quot;.... and more of the same.
</em><br>
<p>How unbelievably obtuse.
<br>
<p>I don't have my OED here in LA, so I'll just use the online Merriam
<br>
Webster version.
<br>
<p>1 a : a comprehensive and fundamental law, doctrine, or assumption b
<br>
(1) : a rule or code of conduct (2) : habitual devotion to right
<br>
principles &lt;a man of principle&gt; c : the laws or facts of nature
<br>
underlying the working of an artificial device
<br>
2 : a primary source : ORIGIN
<br>
3 a : an underlying faculty or endowment &lt;such principles of human
<br>
nature as greed and curiosity&gt; b : an ingredient (as a chemical) that
<br>
exhibits or imparts a characteristic quality
<br>
4 capitalized, Christian Science : a divine principle : GOD
<br>
<p>I clearly didn't mean 2-4 when I said that principles were arrays of
<br>
symbols.  (And, hey, if you'd had some charity, maybe you could have
<br>
seen that.  This is an area where bad ethos will get you in trouble.
<br>
Seriously, try to engage with respect and empathy.  Try to figure out
<br>
how I could possibly be right.  You just might figure out what I meant
<br>
for a change.)
<br>
<p>So I meant definition 1.  And laws, doctrines, assumptions, rules, and
<br>
codes are all statements, usually sentences.  Sentences ARE arrays of
<br>
symbols.  But the key point I was making there is that even principles
<br>
which are not written down as scratches on paper are encoded
<br>
physically in the brain: they are coded statements.  The brain is a
<br>
symbolic processor in this sense, just like the Turing machine.
<br>
Principles in the brain are complex arrays of brain symbols.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you claiming your strange definition is correct and *everybody*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else including the Oxford English Dictionary is wrong?
</em><br>
<p>No, I claim that you failed to understand what I said, because you
<br>
were looking for a way to make me wrong, rather than looking for how
<br>
or why I could possibly be right.  You picked the wrong
<br>
interpretation, instead of the right one.  See how that's a waste of
<br>
our time?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The brain can't *arbitrarily* change its hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The brain is very plastic and continually forges new connectivity ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the *physical neurons* change ... and not just signal routes. Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you deny this? How can ontogeny occur at all by your account?
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't deny this.  But changing physical neurons does not imply
<br>
changing hardware.  Babbage's Analytical Engine, a mechanical
<br>
computer, changes its PHYSICAL layout.  But it still can't change its
<br>
hardware.  The hardware is just the part that it can't change.  In a
<br>
normal desktop computer, the hardware is the stuff you can drop on
<br>
your foot, but that's just a coincidence about computers as we build
<br>
them today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I&gt;t's obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;restricted by the laws of physics, but it also suffers from many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more restrictive limitations.  The Turing machine has some obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;limitations, but the fact that it can't change THOSE doesn't mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it's not just like a brain (in all the relevant ways).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it isn't like the brain in ANY way ... the brain is distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallel.
</em><br>
<p>Look, I keep saying that they share property A, and that A is the
<br>
relevant property, the way in which they are both alike, which implies
<br>
that they have property B in common.  You insist: &quot;No!  they do not
<br>
share property C!  Your claim is refuted!&quot;  But, of course, I never
<br>
said that they had property C in common, and nothing I said should
<br>
lead us to infer that they had THAT property in common.  What I DID
<br>
say is that property C is irrelevant to the claim that they have
<br>
property A in common and therefore prooperty B in common.
<br>
<p>They are both equivalent in behavior to a Turing machine.  Therefore,
<br>
they both share the limitations of a Turing machine.  One of them is a
<br>
distributed parallel system, and the other one isn't.  But (pay
<br>
attention now) that is irrelevant to the claim I'm making.
<br>
<p>Distributed parallel systems are equivalent to Turing machines in
<br>
behavior.  They can't do anything a big fast Turing machine couldn't
<br>
do.  Does that mean that I'd build one?  No, but that doesn't matter.
<br>
What matters is that they share the same limitations.  Whatever
<br>
behavior the one couldn't exhibit, the other couldn't exhibit either.
<br>
<p>Neither one can change their own &quot;hardware,&quot; by definition.
<br>
Resistance to damage is irrelevant to *behavior*.  They share the same
<br>
limitations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You persist with the old hardware/ software language that just doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cut it when examining neural computers .... there is not software, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight-states ... evolution sculpts the response directly.
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with calling that software, exactly?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt;So, I'm not telling you that the brain's circuitry is analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt;circuitry of a Turing machine, but that the brain's hardware, the part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt;that cannot be changed internally, is equivalent to the Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt;machine's hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is not a scrap of evidence for this ... what studies do you cite here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And which parts of the brain are you saying are non-plastic?
</em><br>
<p>Look, I'm not going to *bother* to cite this no-brainer.  Some
<br>
characteristics of the brain are non-plastic.  The fact that the brain
<br>
can't change the laws of physics implies that the laws of physics can,
<br>
if need be, serve as the non-plastic element.  I'm not making a very
<br>
large assumption here, but important conclusions follow from this
<br>
obvious point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Now, I want to remind you that I don't share those &quot;feelings&quot; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you.  I'm an anti-realist about feelings.  We should reinterpret them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;as purely physical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Why *should* we do that ... why adopt such ludicrous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-intuitional way of talking .. nobody actually does this. I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make equally as strong a case that the physical is an epiphenomena
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the mental, and that everything is an &quot;illusion&quot; and that nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is physical .... but I would rather assume that both physical AND
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-physical entities can happily co-exist. MVT allows me that ... I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am not forced to adopt such extreme and unwieldy positions as either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialism or idealism (both worn-out philosophical jargon worlds).
</em><br>
<p>Because materialism is scientific.  Materials can be scientifically
<br>
verified.  Phenomena cannot.  No other philosophical theory, including
<br>
MVT, can claim the scientific high ground.  We need nothing more than
<br>
the materials to explain everything material.  Why invoke the ideal
<br>
when we have a science of materials?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All you are saying is that there is a lessening only in *degree or type* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physicalness ... that the phantom effect of the pineal eye is less physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the actual cellular structure that has gone ... whereas I take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further view that abstract images can only be formed by an abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense-organ (memory of physical organ, if you like). The language differs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but maybe this is not a significant difference .. the philosophy and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jargon just gets in the way here.
</em><br>
<p>If you like.  But it seems that one way of using this jargon has
<br>
considerably more intuitive appeal than the other, though we disagree
<br>
which one has that status.  If you like, this may be an argument from
<br>
intuitive grounds as to which jargon we ought to use.  But this is not
<br>
an idle concern.  Our jargon shapes the way we view the world and
<br>
interact with it.  It fundamentally shapes what theories we will
<br>
accept and which we will not.  So, if that's irrelevant to you, we can
<br>
skip the philosophy, and leave it up in the air as to which jargon has
<br>
more intuitive appeal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;My incapacity to point to something doesn't mean that it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical.  But no matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you have big problems here ... the  essence of being physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be that there *should* be something you can point to, or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least detect by the instrument of physics. Without any objective evidence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your claim to the physicallness of such &quot;unpointable to&quot; things is weak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at best ... and is eminently challengeable by idealists and others.
</em><br>
<p>Not very.  All physical objects can be pointed to.  You cannot point
<br>
at any properties, however.  Time is a property of a physical object.
<br>
It is not a physical object, but it is a physical property.  Same
<br>
thing with length.  You cannot point to two inches, but you can point
<br>
to objects which are two inches long, and no non-physical things have
<br>
the property of being two-inches long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure, both are illusions, holes have locations ... but also feelings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be &quot;in my guts&quot; or elsewhere .. just different, internal places.
</em><br>
<p>They can be, but they NEEDN'T be.  I picked sadness for a reason.
<br>
Sadness isn't anywhere.  Metaphorically, it's in the heart, but we all
<br>
understand that as poetry, not a scientific claim about the facts of
<br>
the matter.  If physical (in)capacities have physical objects as
<br>
substrates, then sadness cannot count.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Well, I'll just adopt this phenomenologist strategy to answer you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;point above, then.  Time may be a measurement, but it's a &quot;physical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;measurement, whatever &quot;physical&quot; means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Physical&quot; here might mean &quot;hallucinatory&quot; or &quot;mental&quot; .... fictional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even? What exactly do you mean by &quot;physical&quot; since you use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to describe some very, very different things. Can one thing be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;less&quot; physical than another? If so, then you have a scalar system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and at one extreme of the scale will be &quot;non-physical&quot; things.
</em><br>
<p>Because even under idealism there will be a difference between the
<br>
hallucinations of brains and minds.  The one will be a &quot;physical&quot;
<br>
hallucination, under that wacky definition, but even then, the mind
<br>
STILL won't be &quot;physical.&quot;  Same old problem, even under a radically
<br>
bizarre definiton of &quot;physical.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Again, you cannot get away from this problem by using idealism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because you still have all the same problems, slightly modified for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;idealism.  What's the connection between sensations-of-brains and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sadness?  How can you solve the problem of other minds with idealism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;All you have access to is sensations of their behavior, and of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;brains.  How can you conclude that they have a mind on that basis?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, which is why (if you have ever read any of my MVT publications) I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am careful to avoid identification with any of the philosophical camps ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I trot out the idealist position just to counter your physicalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption,
</em><br>
<p>But it doesn't help *your* position, because you fall under attack
<br>
from both sides.  If I have to, I'll take the more general view that
<br>
it doesn't matter which is right, idealism or physicalism, because,
<br>
whichever it turns out to be, your theory is either wrong or
<br>
non-explanatory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I actually think the distinction between phyical and mental is blurred,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the shape of the body changes the shape of the mind, and the shape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the mind affects the shape and action of the body (Aristotle).
</em><br>
<p>Aristotle didn't know, just as Descartes didn't know, that the
<br>
physical world is causally closed.  That was our original problem,
<br>
you'll recall.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You might be taking a page from the anti-realist's book and say &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cannot be wrong about there being a mind there, because the mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;itself is on the same ontological level as an illusion.  If I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that there's a mind there, then there's an illusion of a mind there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;so there's a mind there, because a mind is just an illusion of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mind.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly, this is the pointless circularity of philosophy divorced from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts and observations of nature.
</em><br>
<p>Read that again... I was characterizing a view which you might be
<br>
holding.  Are you?  I assume not, but if not, it's not obvious what
<br>
you WERE saying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;But then I can make a similar move back in the physical realm: &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;can't be wrong in making belief statements about minds, because having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a mind is just the same as our 'believing' that there's a mind there.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(Again, scare quotes to remind you that I'm reinterpreting 'belief' to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be purely physical.)  This, obviously, is just the Turing test: if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;seems&quot; to have a mind to us, then it does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just word games, absolutely content-free!
</em><br>
<p>If that's the case, then the difference between MVT and MVT' is nil.
<br>
One has some extra non-scientific content-free statements.  Hmmm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a scalar view which is actually neither physicalist, idealist or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dualist .... MVT is adequate on all explanatory accounts, whereas your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictional and unbuildable Turing machine view is no better than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medieval supernaturalist account .... you have no evidence.
</em><br>
<p>Name calling.  And, I argue, the reverse of the case: MVT FAILS under
<br>
all explanatory accounts.  It's no good under idealism, no good under
<br>
physicalism, no good under dualism (even scalar dualism), it's just no
<br>
good, unless you resort to equating MVT with MVT', which is an
<br>
acceptable interpretative maneuver, but makes your theory no theory of
<br>
consciousness at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; I don't accept that &quot;consciousness&quot; is a handy term for a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; phenomena at all ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Fine.  But don't accuse me of contradicting myself, because when *I*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;use the word &quot;consciousness,&quot; I'm referring to physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;characteristics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But when you refer to absolutely anything at all you must prefix &quot;physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics&quot; .... so what. I make a distinction between &quot;physical minds&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when talking of E-2 animals controlled by their phyical (cellular) pineal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;non-physical&quot; or &quot;abstract&quot; minds in the E-1 case where no cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures remain. How to you propose to word this distinction?
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with &quot;E-2&quot; and &quot;E-1&quot;?  &quot;present/absent&quot; eye?  Stupid and
<br>
smart?  The possibilities are endless.  You can even use &quot;non-physical
<br>
mind&quot; if you like, so long as you understand that as shorthand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;No strictly *chemical* effects, but the &quot;psychological&quot; effects are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical effects.  The placebo has an indirect physical effect to cure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the patient, by making the patient &quot;think&quot; that they are being cured,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and, for example, relieving stress, and bolstering the immune system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;All physical all the time.  The placebo effect *is* physical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But your epiphenomenalism has to show that everything runs exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same whether people can &quot;think&quot; or not, and the placebo case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly refutes this. &quot;Thinks&quot; is a consciousness term.
</em><br>
<p>I put scare quotes around &quot;thinks&quot; to indicate that I meant my
<br>
anti-realistic &quot;thinks.&quot;  It's the behavior of your thinking, the
<br>
physical part of your thinking, the bit that, formally speaking, a
<br>
philosophical zombie could exhibit without having any thoughts at all.
<br>
Thinking and acting like you're thinking are not the same; the second
<br>
part is what I mean when I say &quot;thinks.&quot;
<br>
<p>Simply by making the patient do the physical part, the placebo works.
<br>
No mental elements need be involved.  &quot;thinks&quot; is a shorthand for
<br>
brain states, not for non-physical ghoulies and gohesties which you'll
<br>
never observe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Still, it would all be physical.  Physical words would affect my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical brain, which would affect my physical body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The sound, or written symbol, of the word I can accept as &quot;physical&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the normal usage of the term, but not the &quot;meaning&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretable content or significance, &quot;that thought which is conveyed&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the word.  Can you make this distinction, or is the &quot;meaning&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical to you are the air-wave/ sound or light-wave/ image?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;meaning,&quot; if applicable at all, is in &quot;use.&quot;  The &quot;referent&quot; is the
<br>
thing that we'd probably point to if asked &quot;what's the referent of
<br>
this scratch on paper?&quot;  It's also in other scratches on paper, in
<br>
other physical symbols.
<br>
<p>Yes, meaning is as physical as an air-wave.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;In the brain.  It is encoded in the layout of the neurons and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;connections, just as computer code is encoded in the layout of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;transistors on a chip.  The program is there.  It can be changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;externally, by culture, experience, etc. but the program is there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;just as a robot's program is on its hard disk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But no one can read the internal state of a neural computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it is a dynamic system ... the memory does not &quot;exist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as stored until some hook or other activates a state similar to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous pattern that evokes a &quot;memory&quot;. I think you are confusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;program&quot; with &quot;constraints&quot; .... a neural computer &quot;learns&quot; by exposure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to lots of examples .. and makes its own patterns from these ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is how a humanoid infant learns to talk .. by being talked to ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and listening to voices in the world, and NOT by being given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book on the rules of grammar or a English primer. Same with neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers ... no programmers or software .... just reward for correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and absence or reward for wrong, and it figures out the patterns for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself.
</em><br>
<p>When I simulate a neural network that does this on my desktop, is it
<br>
exhibiting a program or constraints?  I'm not conflating these;
<br>
they're the same.  The presence or absence of a human programmer
<br>
doesn't imply that it's not a program.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It only answers Leibnitz as well as functionalism does.  But if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;understood the objections against functionalism, you'll see that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;still haven't captured what mental realists want to capture about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;feelings.&quot;  To have certain physical capacities is not to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;feeling.  It's easy to imagine someone with (or without) those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;capacities who has or doesn't have feelings.  They're different in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;definition, in principle.  And you haven't explained the link.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The link is in the identification with phantom pineal eye sensation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as &quot;self&quot; owned or originating .... we &quot;own&quot; our thoughts and feelings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in a  way that your robot cannot, it is a closed physical system, whereas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have a &quot;non-cellular&quot; component.
</em><br>
<p>No, this is not an explanation.  You don't explain why we necessarily
<br>
have a feeling when we have physical (in)capacities.  Here, you just
<br>
re-insist that we DO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; The abstract, phantom pineal eye is not physical in the same way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; the pineal gland is physical: thus it could interact ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sure, not physical the same way capacities are not physical.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that's not enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The whole-part fusion of physical brain with phantom organ of generic sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is enough to provide us with an experiential gestalt, we can reintegrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action-potential signals into the whole experience because our brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantiate a sensor out of the very same type of action-potential signals.
</em><br>
<p>No.  There's no gestalt when one link in the chain is missing: the
<br>
link between the physical (in)capacities and the feelings, on your
<br>
terms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you cannot move from &quot;can&quot; to &quot;does&quot; ... so your speculation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carries no more weight than the supernaturalists, perhaps the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientologists who think we are possessed by Thetan demons ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both accounts work in theory to cover any potential type of experience,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but neither are true in practice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Start from the phenomena, look at how the brain IS constructed, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case that the brain is a neural computer (or cluster of) is irrefutable.
</em><br>
<p>Neural computers, all of them, are Turing machine equivalents.  They
<br>
are equivalent in behavior.  They share their limitations.  If one of
<br>
them can't be free-willed, then neither is the other.  If one of them
<br>
can't have feelings, then neither can the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;When we design a functional human-equivalent AI, it will obviously be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a Turing equivalent.  Will you be in the camp of philosophers who will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;insist that it still cannot be conscious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go ahead and do it ...... if you can. But even if you achieve it YOU still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deny it can be &quot;conscious&quot; because of your strange physicalist beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>I asked you a question.  This was not an answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And you are talking only about a &quot;human EQUIVALENT&quot; .. I and MVT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are talking about the real things and how they actually DID evolve, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some simulation fiction!
</em><br>
<p>The simulation tells us facts about the reality.  It's like how math
<br>
tells us about physics.
