</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;monolothic flywheel can instead be many million in a relatively inert human

<em>&gt; Experimental versions have been made. The biggest problem is that energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; density goes up with the square of the rotational speed - to get the really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great storage numbers you need million RPM units and above. This requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exotic materials for the flywheel rim. (Also, a pretty hard vacuum to spin in!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember to put all the rotating mass (or as much as possible) at the rim...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Magnetic suspension bearings are 'de rigeur'. The best way to couple energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in and out is to use three - phase induction motor / generator techniques.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This requires a variable speed driver / inverter system that outputs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regular house current.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One experimental power storage version I read about was designed so if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filament-wound rotor should fail, it would expand relatively slowly in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radial direction and spend its' energy in friction against the housing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's still not pleasant to be near, but at least there's no shrapnel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My &quot;dream home&quot; design has a low-speed flywheel (~7200 RPM)  driven by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three-phase motor off the power lines - not much energy is used to keep it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spinning - that in turn drives a synchronous generator. Almost perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isolation for brown-outs and dropouts in the main supply line, and in case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a blackout, a Diesel generator has ample time to start and speed up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the flywheel slows too much...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All this brings to mind a non-chemical &quot;grenade&quot; described by Dean Ing: a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miniature flywheel running at some incredible speed - it has a sawtooth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern on it's rim. Encase it in a frangible vacuum housing with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mirror-image sawtooth on the inside. The rotor axis is held rigid in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;unarmed&quot; state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once it's emplaced, the rotor axis is released - it's retained by magnetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bearings in the center as long as no one moves the housing. If the thing IS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moved, precession causes the rotor and housing to come into rather violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contact...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>I was thinking the flywheel could have six counterrotating smaller wheels around
<br>
it.  So, when power is added, the the main flywheel is accelerated in one direction
<br>
and the support flywheels the other direction.  So, if there a power outage, power
<br>
is drawn from all of them at once, providing smooth transition and power output.
<br>
Also, if the flywheel was levitating in its vacuum above the superconductor, then
<br>
power could be drawn directly to slow it to prevent the flywheel from graxing
<br>
anything at a high rate of speed.
<br>
<p>Your grenage sounds like the weapon in James Bond where the guy has a sawblade on a
<br>
whip.  Another example from RPG's is the shuriken cannon, where discs of high
<br>
strength and edge sharpness are spun to a high speed and launched using
<br>
electromagnetic force.
<br>
<p>If the battery housing was moved, for example, without some kind of compensation,
<br>
then the moving parts might contact, which is an issue.  There might be some kind
<br>
of ablative material on the normally distant surfaces.  That would be another
<br>
situation for the autoshutdown with the counterrotating wheels.
