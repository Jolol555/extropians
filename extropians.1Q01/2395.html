<p><p>True enough.  Although the facts of these neural connections also
<br>
explain the basic similarities of the fundamental &quot;mystical&quot; experiences
<br>
across cultures and religions.  That fundamental loss of self, sense of
<br>
merging, ecstasy, and so on has been judged by many to be all the more
<br>
special, compelling and &quot;mystical&quot; simply because it was seemingly
<br>
universal regardless of what words and images are wrapped around it
<br>
afterwards.  A common set of neural underpinnings explains the
<br>
commonality quite nicely. 
<br>
<p>I will have to dig it up but I also came across a book a while back that
<br>
diagrammed what meditation does to different brain centers and what the
<br>
likely subjective resulting experiences would be.  It included mention
<br>
of the centers of the brain used in creating running dialog, more
<br>
generally verbalization and conceptualization, being turned off by
<br>
common meditation practices.  It is no wonder the experience is
<br>
&quot;ineffable&quot; - literally beyond words.  It also showed how turning off
<br>
certain brain regions (relatively) could cause a feedback that
<br>
overloaded other centers leading to emotional flooding and ecstasy.
