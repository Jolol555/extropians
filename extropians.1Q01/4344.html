writes:&lt;&lt; The study showed that it was viable for people to move from peasant 
<br>
to high ranking party official in their own lifetime, for instance, whereas 
<br>
the norm by
<br>
far under capitalism is to move very little from the social position in which 
<br>
you are born. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, whereas in the U. S. one has to be born wealthy.  Examples (sticking to 
<br>
your peasant to high ranking party official point)
<br>
<p>Harry S. Truman:  Dirt farmer and haberdasher that went broke.  Lived his 
<br>
entire married life in his mother in law's house.
<br>
Dwight D. Eisenhower:  Strictly a working class background.  Received his 
<br>
education by appointment ot a college that didn't cost any money.
<br>
John F. Kennedy.  Wealthy
<br>
Lyndon B. Johnson.  Started as a school teacher with a state college education
<br>
Richard M. Nixon.  A grocer's son.
<br>
Gerald Ford.  Adopted son of a man of modest means.
<br>
Jimmy Carter.  I believe the son of a well to do farmer.
<br>
Ronald Reagan.  Son of an alcoholic employed as a shoe salesman.
<br>
George Bush.  Wealthy
<br>
William Clinton.  Step son of an alcoholic car salesman.
<br>
George W. Bush.  Wealthy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the only reason most of these men weren't raised further down the 
<br>
totem pole was that they were born at a time when they were close to bottom 
<br>
of the pole.
