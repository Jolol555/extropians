Thanks, Jeff, for bringing up Bernal. This book has long been one of my
<br>
favorites, and I agree that this guy was way ahead of his time. I had heard of
<br>
this book from a number of different sources over the years, and after
<br>
searching for three or four years, was able to locate a copy of a reprint
<br>
edition from the '60s (don't have the book in front of me). I'm glad to see
<br>
that someone has made it available on the web. A truly bizarre mind,
<br>
especially for the time. I was surprised to find out that Stapledon was one of
<br>
the few (and maybe only) early SF writers to have been influenced by Bernal,
<br>
since this little tome is so chock full of incredible ideas.
<br>
<p>Oddly enough, I first saw a reference to this book while reading another book
<br>
called Late for the Sky : The Mentality of the Space Age by David Lavery, an
<br>
anti-space-age polemic written by a communications professor somewhere (again,
<br>
don't have the book in front of me). He actually uses Bernal's book as a
<br>
negative illustration, but it had the opposite effect on me. Lavery's book is
<br>
worth hunting down for the bibliography alone, but I don't suspect many people
<br>
on this list will agree with his thesis (I certainly don't). It's worth
<br>
reading, though, for a look into the mind of someone who pretty much opposes
<br>
the type of technological development that is taken for granted here, but does
<br>
it in a well-researched, reasonable way. He's definitely not a crank, just
<br>
someone who draws vastly different conclusions.
<br>
<p>I'm pretty sure I know what the surprise is you're referring to in regards to
<br>
Bernal, so I won't mention it either. In that regard, he was definitely a
<br>
product of his times.

<em>&gt; What I find most interesting is that he wrote this in 1929, despite which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he seems to have anticipated much of modern science and future science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including: Matrishka brains/Dyson spheres, nanotech (he was an x-ray

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He also deals very astutely with the inescapable challenge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty/indeterminacy re attempting to predict the future.

<em>&gt; Good read.  Very extropian.  With one exception,...which I'll leave you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover on your own--a small surprise.
