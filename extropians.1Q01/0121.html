</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aw, let's see... Yep, I reviewed it very favorably in a national newspaper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in August 1981, so it's just possible that I read it even before you did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I reviewed `The Mind's I' in April 1983, ditto.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's what I figured.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You seem to be exhibiting waaay too much shock over a simple bit of fun...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought we were having a reasoned discussion here.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we are.  It's just that I get the impression, from the quotation you
<br>
posted, that you don't like self-reference.  *Authorial reference* is part
<br>
of Old Author Syndrome, with the canonical example being Heinlein. 
<br>
Authorial reference rots modern culture.  Authorial reference is always
<br>
bad.  It is bad even, in my opinion, when Hofstadter does it at the end of
<br>
GEB.  Authors should stay out of the way of their work.  The riddle I
<br>
constructed whose answer is &quot;Eliezer&quot; or &quot;an AI researcher&quot; is a bad
<br>
riddle even if it scans, and I constructed it only to make a point.
<br>
<p>Self-reference - such as a riddle which refers to itself, or a Godel
<br>
statement, or an Epimenides paradox - is entirely innocuous and in no way
<br>
erosive of real-world grounding.  Sure, it's possible to construct
<br>
self-referential paradoxes, and it's possible to analyze them, and you can
<br>
have fun doing it; it's part of the fresh, clear skies of science.  There
<br>
is no connection to the murky waters of deconstructionism.
