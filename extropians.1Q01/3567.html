I'm not sure I agree.
<br>
<p>My take on human intelligence (our only real existence proof to date)
<br>
is that human beings are *not* very intelligent. We're marginally
<br>
intelligent -- sufficiently so to act as a substrate for the transfer
<br>
and evolution of ideas -- and it's this evolution of ideas (memes) that
<br>
give us the appearance of intelligence. It takes a lot of human beings
<br>
to generate new memes successfully.  If we *do* develop an AI capable 
<br>
of enhancing itself, (a) it will be a descendent of our current memes 
<br>
that does the job, and (b) the AI will itself be a vehicle for such memetic
<br>
evolution. Think in terms of the intelligence evolving its own goals,
<br>
rather than the goal-driven evolution leading to the pursuit of enhanced
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>(I'm tying myself in knots here, so I'll stop for a while.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6. I think the best observation we have on this topic is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's, that the utilitarian goal of superintelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be pursued as a subgoal of a 'Friendliness' supergoal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a design principle this leaves a lot of questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unanswered - what, explicitly, should the Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoal be? how can we ensure that it is *interpreted*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a genuinely Friendly fashion? how can we harness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence, not just to the realization of goals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but to the creation of design principles more likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue in what we really want? - but it's the best starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point I've seen. Whether there is such a thing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *superintelligence that is not goal-driven* is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important question.
</em><br>
<p>We don't know any superintelligences yet, but we know quite a lot of
<br>
(rather similar) intelligences. What goals drive *us*, and why?
<br>
If we can answer that question we may be able to discuss how SI's
<br>
might discover or evolve their own goals.
