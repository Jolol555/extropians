A Roman University team claims to have invented an electronic nose so
<br>
sensitive that it can detect early forms of tumours and other illnesses,
<br>
including impending heart attacks, by &quot;sniffing&quot; a person's breath, sweat
<br>
or urine. Called the Libra Nose, this small device, was developed by
<br>
Prof Arnaldo D'Amico with Corrado Di Natale and Alessandro Mantini
<br>
of Rome University (at Tor Vergata).
<br>

<br>
<p>It works on the basis that illnesses produce chemical changes in the human
<br>
organism which while not detectable to the senses, emit different odours.
<br>
By being trained to recognise sample smells, the instrument would soon
<br>
be able to detect a whole range of illnesses, scientists said.
<br>
Prof D'Amico, a specialist in electronic sensors, said that the instrument
<br>
was now being used in experiments in order to build up a dictionary of
<br>
relevant smells.
<br>
<p>As a result Libra Nose would be able to precisely detect early signs of
<br>
illnesses such as lung cancer before any other form of test.
<br>
The method could also be used to track the evolution of an illness,
<br>
and to detect illnesses in newborn babies.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are comparing the breath of groups of people afflicted with
<br>
different illness, with that of people who are well,&quot; Prof A'Amico said.
<br>
&quot;The outcome will be a series of chemical photographs [by means 
<br>
of some chemio-opto-coupling device] revealing different characteristics, 
<br>
according to the condition of the human organism.
<br>
Prof D'Amico said that the device could also be used in the study of
<br>
dietetics and sport, and by a woman to check her hormone changes
<br>
and periods of fertility with precision.
<br>
<p>But, as you can see, the LibraNose is specialized in testing (and tasting?)
<br>
wines. [They told me that this device, due to very complex memories
<br>
and neural nets, is now capable of recognize a 1992 Brunello wine 
<br>
among  others Brunello.]
