<p>If you say so. I just noticed how much less I felt like that once I
<br>
stopped feeling stupid because M$ products seemed bloated and
<br>
incomprehensible, as did other things such as the unfolding Java and
<br>
Ecmascript product(s) pushed by other players. I figured out that it
<br>
might not all be my fault, that I might not be the stupid one, and that
<br>
a product with forty million features, some that work, is not something
<br>
I need to buy.
<br>
<p>The last straw for me was when M$ implemented a bunch of book-publishing
<br>
features in a version of Word--just long enough to FUD Pagemaker--then
<br>
dropped all those features in the next version of Word. I got the
<br>
message loud and clear. So I hung up the phone. I use Win98, but that's
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>We might all be dying, but some of us are CRAN-conscious.
