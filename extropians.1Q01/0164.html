<p><p>I use USAA too.  Although it is a semi-exclusive insurance company, no 
<br>
better one exists. Exceptional service and excellent rates.  And of course, 
<br>
there is the premium refund at the end of the year. They also offer a very 
<br>
good selection of financial services with their usual excellent 
<br>
service.  Quite frankly, I can't think of another big company I would 
<br>
rather deal with on a regular basis.
<br>
<p>The premium refund, for people who don't know about USAA, is where the 
<br>
insurance company will give all its members a refund on their premiums at 
<br>
the end of the year if 1) the number of claims filed was smaller than 
<br>
projected for the year, or 2) if the investment of the premiums returns a 
<br>
higher than expected yield.  The refund has typically been 5-25% of their 
<br>
already low insurance rates, depending on the year.  This all possible 
<br>
because USAA is a not-for-profit company.  Hmm...  This is almost a minor 
<br>
tax loophole -- if they invested your premium well enough, you could get 
<br>
your insurance for free.
