<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I think the big problem postmodernists [...] see with transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;self-modification is that they make someone (me or my child) an object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of transformation, hence reducing the person. Making humans objects =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bad. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's so hard to know what the standard pomo/poststructuralist position is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be on such a topic. 
</em><br>
<p>I guess there is even a bit of contradiction in terms when talking
<br>
about a standard pomo position about anything. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; On the one hand, the objection you summarize is actually classically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *humanist*, maybe Kantian, and assumes the sovereignty of a unified person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or subject. Subverting that posit is at the core of the postmodern project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and, of course, much of cognitive science). So you can have somewhat pomo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people like Donna Haraway famously proclaiming herself a feminist cyborg. 
</em><br>
<p>And if you start to deconstruct the self, then you will soon be left
<br>
in a situation where it is very hard to talk about human dignity or
<br>
other high-level ethical constructions. You are surrounded by lego
<br>
pieces, but dignity only refers to big constructions, not the
<br>
parts. Actually, when looking for pomo texts on the concept of human
<br>
dignity on the web, to my amusement I only found christian right texts
<br>
denouncing the evil postmodernist-technological alliance that was
<br>
destroying the concept of human dignity by its reductionism and
<br>
materialism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other, one key to many post-discourses is `self-fashioning', just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the kind of strange loop self-construction you mention. In practice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of pomo's source in Marxist and postmarxist discourses, you often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find a lot of analyses that denounce market commodification of the body and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual, complaints that really do sound more like traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanist ideology.
</em><br>
<p>I have got the impression that while the postmodern tools are eagerly
<br>
used on everything else, they are not used on the postmodern discourse
<br>
itself. So it is quite common for people in this sphere to hold what
<br>
are actually modernist views like humanism and Marxism but disguised
<br>
and justified under a ton of pomo discourse.
<br>
<p>I have noticed that Marx's definition of freedom also pops up in the
<br>
strangest places (a free act is an act done without an positive or
<br>
negative incentives to do it - which is a quite crazy definition when
<br>
you start thinking about it). Since it is so sensitive, any influence
<br>
one human has over another is coercive, and this helps bolster the
<br>
anti design rhethoric. Shows how a very prevalent but low-key stupid
<br>
meme can infect the discourse from advertising to genetics. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Most of the talk on this list about `inalienable rights' and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystical individualist beliefs derive, of course, from 18th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deist liberal humanism.)
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Extropianism is the enlightenment on steroids&quot;  
<br>
<p>I think transhumanism must learn to incorporate the good parts of
<br>
postmodernism in our discourse to really get an impact on mainstream
<br>
thinking. I notice how transhumanist texts often give a cheerful
<br>
modernist impression that may not be entirely in tune with the current
<br>
intellectual climate. One reason people think that extropianism is
<br>
some sort of optimism cult is that they have been raised on the idea
<br>
of questioning unbounded optimism - which is of course a good idea
<br>
after the lessons of the 20th century - but miss our own internal
<br>
questioning and criticism. I think the individualist beliefs and other
<br>
enlightenment stuff we have are great, but if we can recombine them
<br>
with postmodern scepticism we will get a hybrid that may very well be
<br>
a very vital discourse/meme.
