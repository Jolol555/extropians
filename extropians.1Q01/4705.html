<em>&gt;&quot;In mathematics, of the 1,085 recipients of Ph.D.'s in 1999 in the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;States, only 10 were black, and only six of the black Ph.D.'s were women.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;means what percentage of black Ph.D. candidates in Math were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;women?  Generally 60% is considered a majority not a minority...wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what they were trying to get at here?  The less than 1% black candidates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strikes me as odd though.  Is there any known genetic advantage caucasians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have in mathematical/logic fields?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>To your last question, no. In fact, there's no genetic basis for race at 
<br>
all. Skin color is genetically controlled obviously, but what I mean is that 
<br>
there is no gross difference in the genomes between people of different 
<br>
races on the same scale as the X/Y difference in gender. If you were to come 
<br>
up with a genetic basis for race, you would have to come up with some very 
<br>
complicated rules, like &quot;people with Gene A but not Gene B or C are 
<br>
considered this race, unless they have Gene D (but not E)&quot;. Race is 
<br>
appearance based.
<br>
There are going to be cultural/economic advantages causasians might have in 
<br>
these fields, but the gap is closing all the time, and I expect that before 
<br>
my (natural) lifetime is over, it will be nonexistent.
<br>
I do not have exact figures but I know that largest contraction in this gap 
<br>
occurred sometime in the 1980s. Keep in mind how long it takes to get a 
<br>
Ph.D, you're looking that far back in the past.
