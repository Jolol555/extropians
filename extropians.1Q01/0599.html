<p><em> &gt;My take on &quot;extremism&quot; is that extremists try to go as far as possible in
</em><br>
one direction or the other.  I think the real answer is always somewhere in
<br>
the middle.
<br>
<p>Maybe I have this wrong, but are we suggesting that the guiding principle
<br>
for making decisions is to be its placement on the scale of popular beliefs?
<br>
Why not base your decisions on your rational analysis of the facts? Yes you
<br>
might come to a position that many people may not hold, but you will have
<br>
been honest with yourself and not compromised your opinions for the sake of
<br>
being &quot;non-combative&quot; i.e. You want to figure out whether the 2nd amendment
<br>
is morally sound? Well read it, then read the federalist papers, then read
<br>
anything about it written by the authors (and anyone else) about why it is
<br>
there. Then come to a conclusion and stand by it. I can understand why this
<br>
angle may seem combative to majority of people, only because most people
<br>
suffer from the lack of self esteem to trust their own decisions so they go
<br>
for the nice gooey safe middle.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;The fact of the matter is that any position can be taken to unreasonable
</em><br>
extremes.
<br>
<p>I don't think the correct and &quot;right&quot; solution is to go to far. I cant
<br>
imagine an engineer thinking like this when building a product. Like him
<br>
saying &quot;Steel is the hardest material we can build this bridge out of and
<br>
Jell-O is the softest, lets find something in the middle to use&quot;. Just as
<br>
the engineer building a product used the right material, a judge or lawyer
<br>
should use the right law to build a correct objective moral system (the
<br>
alternative is a system based on the whims of the masses).
<br>
<p><em> &gt;It confuses them when they push for their solution and suddenly they go too
</em><br>
far.
<br>
<p>Who decides what is too far?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;They become disoriented when someone allows their solution to be applied
</em><br>
&quot;hypothetically&quot; in all cases, to the point they start running into
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>Applying the solution to all cases is starting to sound like the concept
<br>
&quot;principle&quot;. Yes, I think we can apply principles to many vast areas and
<br>
must do so. They are not to be taken without context though, like killing
<br>
someone that is breaking into your house with the intent of killing you and
<br>
your family would be considered morally acceptable.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;As a self-test, I would argue that anybody who agrees with one side of an
</em><br>
issue all the time is an extremist.
<br>
<p>I think the killing of innocent people is morally wrong 100% of the time
<br>
(which is different then saying I wouldn't do it. i.e. WWII was brought to a
<br>
quick ending in the Pacific with the use of the nuclear bomb. It was morally
<br>
wrong to kill those people, but in the context of the war, more innocent
<br>
people would have died if it wasn't done). So context is key here.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;No group is right 100% of the time.
</em><br>
<p>Is that statement correct 100% of the time? If so, then you just
<br>
contradicted yourself ;P
<br>

<br>
<p><p>P.S. to board owner, can you write me and tell me why I am considered a
<br>
non-member because I do get the list in email so I must be a member of it or
<br>
is something else meant by non-member?
