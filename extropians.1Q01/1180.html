<p><em>&gt;**I am aware of this. Try this: Where I use the word

</em><br>
<p>You evade the key point. A million genome copies of X exist. By random
<br>
chance, many are slightly and heritably altered. The performance of the
<br>
great majority of offspring in a given setting is degraded, of a few
<br>
improved. How hard is it to see that gradually the offspring of
<br>
[contingently-]improved variants will supplant the others? Chance, yes -
<br>
followed by competitive-plus-cooperative selection.

<p><em>&gt;&gt; You, I gather, see a Mind from outside

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;**Entropy is said to be the natural condition. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggest that Extropy requires intelligence. 
</em><br>
<p>`Extropy' is not a scientific concept or construct; it is a social
<br>
metaphor. Complex energetic organisation emerges and thrives by exporting
<br>
entropy into its environment; intelligence has nothing to do with this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I said nothing about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;top-down intervention by an intelligence residing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outside the system. The intelligence may BE the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I see. The universe brought *itself* intelligently into being. Too
<br>
cool. Too self-undermining.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;**Next time you see that Darwin guy, you ask him from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me: How does your theory account for the creation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the whole shebang? The starting kickoff?
</em><br>
<p>Your original post made no claims about the origins of the universe, or
<br>
even the origins of life. You recorded your sentiment that the Hamlet-like
<br>
human mind was far too angelic to have come into existence via brute
<br>
evolutionary processes. 
<br>
<p>I reply: actually, the evolution of the human brain/mind is patently
<br>
darwinian (although some of the selected replicators were doubtless memes,
<br>
which by reciprocal feedback co-evolved with the genes providing their
<br>
material substrate). 
<br>
<p>As for the whole shebang, that might be subject to darwinian explanation
<br>
(in the Linde or Smolin models, which are not untestable), or it might be
<br>
due to a stochastic vacuum fluctuation, but either way it is not relevant
<br>
to the emergence by natural selection of human beings 13 or so billion
<br>
years later. Get a grip on the scale of these phenomena, sir.
