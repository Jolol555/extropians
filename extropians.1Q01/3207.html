A &quot;felon&quot; is simply and only a person convicted of breaking certain
<br>
laws, irrational or not, that the government has decided to call
<br>
felonies, irrational or not.  The *felon* is first and foremost a
<br>
person.  The argument that a felon is a &quot;non-citizen&quot; and therefore
<br>
different rules apply is extremely dangerous.  If rights came only from
<br>
being a &quot;citizen&quot; then the argument might makes sense.  If we believe
<br>
they are the gift of the government and can be rescinded when one
<br>
committed certain crimes *totally* then not one of us is safe.  I and I
<br>
do use &quot;totally&quot; advisably because this argument is speaking of
<br>
literally reprogramming the very mind that makes you you to better suit
<br>
these same government powers.  Except for more &quot;humane&quot; and dependable
<br>
reprogramming technology how is this different than the Soviets throwing
<br>
people into reeducation camps or into psychiatric wards to treat their
<br>
&quot;condition&quot;?  All the government has to do to totally control and
<br>
eliminate any of us is to declare us a &quot;felon&quot; by some law or another
<br>
and they are in control of creating the laws and prosecuting them.   A
<br>
very slippery slope indeed.
