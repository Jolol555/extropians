<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; These are not universal taboos.  Many cultures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ancient tribes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilizations practiced incest, murder, rape, theft,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc.  Incest was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; often used to keep royal, priestly or tribal blood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lines pure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Murder was common-place between warring factions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and was often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ritualized into their religions.  Rape was rarely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen as a taboo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; since woman often did not have rights in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; societies.  (Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; raping someone else's woman was seen as a crime of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property theft.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Theft itself was commonplace between different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tribes or warring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nations.  Not only would I argue against these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taboos being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universal, I daresay the reverse was true.  Incest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; murder, rape and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theft probably were more common historically than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In many cultures (the Masai, ancient Celtic, ancient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; India) cattle theft was regarded as a perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honorable activity. One who could not keep his cattle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not deserve to do so. Rob Roy MacGregor was famous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for being a great 'riever and retriever' - a cattle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thief and one who could pursue and retrieve cattle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stolen from him.

<p><p>Even if all humans did share the same ethical values, surely this would not
<br>
constitute an objective truth? It would merely be a humanity-wide constant.
<br>
The basis for this constance could not be called &quot;objective&quot; either as it
<br>
would have to be based upon evolutionary processes, not ideals.
<br>
Does the void have an objection to rape and pillage?
