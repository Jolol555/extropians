<DIV></DIV>&gt;I don't know what sort of Catholic priests you have in Slovenia. I have 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;found here that Catholic priests tend to not only be some of the most 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;informed and intellectually challenging individuals (especially the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;jesuits) around, but their schools produce the best thinkers in the US, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;IMHO, outside of those raised in jewish households. 
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>i would have to agree. jesuit schools can be some of the most rigorous and inspiring people come out of them. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>i think it's the torturous mental gymnastics they make them perform. latin would tax anyone. they also learn massive amounts of western history, and much about pyschology as well. i have a lot respect for many of my catholic and jesuit school friends. they're not often extremely technically literate, but they're fun, and they can learn things very quickly.</DIV>
