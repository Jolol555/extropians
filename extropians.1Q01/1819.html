<em>&gt;&gt; It appears that this concept has problems....I wonder if they are soluable?
</em><br>

<em>&gt;Oh it has far more problems.  What makes anyone assume that someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't figure out how to remove the modem without damaging the gun?  Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the paint?  And since now you're offering them to anyone who walks into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wal-mart, that kid who used to just stick cherry bombs under garbage cans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is now a potential mass murderer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People complain about the corruption of the police being a problem, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give every citizen the same power and see which is worse...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I deplore the gun thread; however, during the discussion of evmick's prospective futuristic weapon (which is, due to its futurism, an extropic topic), I couldn't help noticing that the progun-nuts took immediate exception to the provision that would have the police notified immediately, by the weapon, whenever it was dicharged.  Even THEY would be forced to admit that they would wish every shooting to be lawful; if an unlawful shooting occurs and the perpetrator is apprehended by such a device calling the constabulary down upon them, that is good, and if a lawful shooting occurs, the police would typically exonerate the shooter, and might be quickly needed on the scene anyway if the self-defending citizen still needed assistance from further attack.  What their objection shows is that they are not just pro-gun, but anti-government and anti-cop; they rhapsodize about dearly desired scenarios when they might get to enjoy the distinct personal pleasure of gunning down a jackboote!
<br>
d man in blue, or overthrowing a popularly elected government Turner Diaries style.  It is a strutting, snarling, I'm-a-badass facade they indulge in, as puerile as the woofings of blustery schoolboys.
