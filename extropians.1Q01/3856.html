<p>I have a different experience. Perhaps it is because most democrat goals

are so inimical to the concept of a free and open society based on trust

of the individual.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose it's easier to just insult someone than try to discuss something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably. What are you afraid of? I'm trying to have an intelligent discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, and it seems like you would rather attack someone you don't even know (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else you deem less intelligent or differently opinioned than youself)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than court the possibility that your opinion may not be the only one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters. As a matter of clarification, my brother is one of thousands of voters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who has filed an official complaint (I really don't know the details) over being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denied his right to vote. As for the ballots, unless you were there and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used them yourself, you really have no rational basis for sniping at peoples'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence or ability to use them. Since he has been voting at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polling place for the last 20 years without any problems, I guess he just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed his voting rights hadn't been undermined. He only noticed something was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awry when it looked like things weren't lining up properly on the ballot. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is when he pointed it out to the poll worker and was basically blown off. I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unclear why you have a problem with this.
</em><br>
<p>I've always voted with a pen and ink ballot and never had any problem
<br>
with my ballot being counted properly. I've seen the Florida ballots in
<br>
question, and they couldn't be more plain. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are just being a pouty little spoil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sport, like leftists usually are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, you resort to name-calling. This is not only insulting and immature, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is useless and a waste of everyone's time. If you are actually interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presenting your point of view rather than just lashing out at imagined enemies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this tactic not only weakens your credibility, it totally defuses your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since I have never once identified myself as a Democrat or a leftist, I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure what reasonable basis you have for making this statement. I have said at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one other time that I don't like Gore either, and certainly didn't vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for him, so why would I be pouting over him losing the election?
</em><br>
<p>a) you voted Green = you are a leftist. Plain and simple. If you are not
<br>
a leftist you wouldn't vote Green.
<br>
b) saying whiny little playground things like 'Bush isn't the legitimate
<br>
President' is, plain and simple, WHINING. Act immature, get treated
<br>
immaturely.
<br>
c) we don't live in a democracy, we live in a republic. get over it. We
<br>
don't elect the president, we elect the electors. The dems approved
<br>
every measure before the election that they later objected to. They
<br>
tried to change the rules after the election. (IMHO they should have
<br>
been disqualified completely for doing it) They still lost. Too bad, get
<br>
over it, grow up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My complaint,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I stated explicitly, is that the election was not honest because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various shenanigans that took place. Just because these under-handed activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; led to Bush being installed as president is irrelevant to me. Had it been the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way around I would feel exactly the same way. My problem is with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blatant disregard shown for the American people, and for our democratic rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (what little is left of them). It has nothing to do with who won. This is why I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel Bush is not legitimately the president, not because I don't like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome. It seems to me that anyone who actually believes in liberty should have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a problem with this.
</em><br>
<p>Considering that most shenanigans were beneficial to Gore and he STILL
<br>
lost, I don't feel the same way. I am breathing one big fat sigh of
<br>
'WHEW' that Bush won. I am so glad I campaigned for Nader and voted for
<br>
Bush. All those sneaky little dems that crossed party lines during the
<br>
primary to vote for McCain then re-registered as democrats got
<br>
themselves a little turnaround.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gore has been cheated of the Presidency, but not by Bush. Clinton should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have been out of office over a year ago. Its Clinton who cheated Gore of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the job. If Clinton was not such a pathetic president, Gore would likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have won. If Clinton hadn't approved Reno's Elian stormtrooper raid,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gore would have won Florida by a statistically significant margin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I absolutely agree with you on this, and it is one of the reasons I see no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant difference between the two major parties. They both serve special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests that have little or no regard for the people, are both corrupt and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonest, and all the empty rhetoric spewed by boths sides won't make a bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference in the quality of our lives. This is why I am confused why you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; react in such a way that appears you are favoring the one side over the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not toss them both out? I say let's have a politics that is free of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrow and functionally empty dichotomies, one that actually reflects the will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the people. Maybe this is naive, and maybe it's impossible to achieve, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems like something worth working toward.
</em><br>
<p>Toss both Clinton and Gore out? Thats what we did. ;-) They tried to
<br>
take the Lincoln Bedroom with them, apparently thinking that they
<br>
continue using it for fundraising in New York.
<br>
<p>I'm frankly rather tired and exasperated with anyone who claims that
<br>
'Bush stole the election'. Anyone who says that either paid absolutely
<br>
no attention to the election and post-election, or else they just
<br>
accepted the DNC party line about what happened. In either case, saying
<br>
that is nothing more or less than whining. Get over it. Thats not name
<br>
calling, thats calling it like it is. Get over it, grow up, and pay
<br>
attention. Read the news paper. Watch news in depth and don't listen to
<br>
the big three networks. Between CNN and FOX you can generally get the
<br>
picture about what goes on. CNN is leftist, FOX is a bit to the right.
<br>
C-SPAN is probably the only source of unjudgemental political news
<br>
around.
<br>
<p>In a day when the dems are continuously on the rampage to declare me and
<br>
people like me 'threats to national security', I cannot help but be
<br>
rather highly motivated to see them out of office. IMHO every democrat
<br>
(or republican) that passes a law that is unconstitutional should be
<br>
impeached automatically for violating their oath of office to 'protect
<br>
and defend the constitution'. If this were to occur, there'd be more
<br>
turnover on the Demcratic wing of Congress than in a McDonalds.
