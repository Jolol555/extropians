<p>
Extropians,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are obviously a great set of questions.  And surely it
<br>
would be silly for such great physicists to consider a question about
<br>
the physics that enables consciousness at this point in time.
<br>
However, there is a theory of consciousness I call &quot;The Qualia Theory
<br>
of Consciousness&quot; which, if it turns out to be true, in retrospect
<br>
people will consider another question about physics to be more
<br>
important than all these.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the current 11 questions about physics are strictly about
<br>
the cause and effect nature of the universe.  This qualia theory of
<br>
consciousness predicts there is more then just &quot;causal effects&quot; to the
<br>
universe.  It predicts something in it (particularly, at least
<br>
something in our brain) has phenomenal qualities which are
<br>
categorically different than the simple causal properties today's
<br>
science is limited to observing, because of it's inability to &quot;eff&quot;
<br>
(as in ineffable).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This theory predicts that our brain represents conscious
<br>
knowledge with a configuration of matter which has phenomenal
<br>
properties.  Not only are these phenomena causal, they are also
<br>
phenomenally &quot;like&quot; something.  A qalia, red for example, has
<br>
phenomenal qualities no abstract representation or mere causal
<br>
representation has (at least as far as we scientifically know).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which physical phenomena has these phenomenal properties and
<br>
how are they realized in the brain is this much more important
<br>
question about the universe.  I'm working on a paper detailing this
<br>
representative theory (which many great philosophyers like Descartes
<br>
and Lock have advocated ideas very close to this for centuries) which,
<br>
despite this support, for some reason is being completely ignored as a
<br>
possibility by almost everyone, especially extropians and physicists.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis Crick, one of the Discoverers of DNA says science is
<br>
at the same point now, with consciousness, as it was with the
<br>
mysterious &quot;life force&quot; right before he and Watson discovered it was
<br>
simply DNA.  If this theory of consciousness is true, it predicts
<br>
science is about to make the discovery which will answer this 12th and
<br>
much more important question about the universe.  It details how
<br>
science will eventually expand its scope to include more than just the
<br>
causal natures of the universe.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this paper I detail some of why this will be by far the
<br>
most significant scientific breakthrough ever made.  I discuss some of
<br>
its drastic implications on the future as we make these discoveries
<br>
and achieve the technologies required to &quot;eff&quot;.  This will all
<br>
ultimately enable us to expand and merge what I consider to be our
<br>
conscious &quot;spirit worlds&quot;, finally freeing us, consciously, from the
<br>
lonely isolated small spiritual prison that is our mortal skull...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've had several discussions on this list where I've argued
<br>
for parts of this theory.  I'm attempting to put this all in a more
<br>
coherent and complete description.  This is a draft of a work in
<br>
progress which I'd love to try to get published some day.  (Hopefully
<br>
before science makes this discovery.) So I'd love to hear any thoughts
<br>
any of you may have on this issue!
