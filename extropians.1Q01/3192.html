For example, I have a Linux PDA.  It has regular UNIX operating system security
<br>
features.  It would probably be more secure if it was running something else.  Yet, it
<br>
is nice that it runs a tty behind the PDA.
<br>
<p>The root account has an unset password.  I have the utilities to write to the boot
<br>
loader of the device, maybe the boot PROM.  I connect to it with the serial port
<br>
terminal, I think it is a good PDA.  Plus, I can write the software that I want to have
<br>
on it.
<br>
<p>I think these computers are great, and they're mine, because I paid cash for them.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, how would such a presumption impact police behavior?  One, it would make
