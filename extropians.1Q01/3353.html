<p>If you ask Jeremy Rifkin et al I seriously doubt that would be your
<br>
answer. He would probably give you something about a nicer society
<br>
that is more in tune with nature, more socially responsible, based on
<br>
small scale technology rather than big systems etc. This fluff is
<br>
unlikely to hold any water, but it sounds good to many people who want
<br>
to be more in tune with nature, want to feel less exploited and
<br>
insecure, fear big business/technology and the ecocalypse that surely
<br>
must come. No mention - and I guess in many cases not even a thought -
<br>
that this would entail reducing not just standards of living but
<br>
populations and likely coercive means.
<br>
<p>The problem for the greens is that they have rather few realistic
<br>
visions of a green world or how to get there. In specific questions
<br>
they often have definite recipes (which quite often end up being
<br>
statist), but the overall strategy is often expressed more in terms of
<br>
a change in public consciousness rather than practical action. While
<br>
we enlightenment-based XNTX people consider this a serious flaw, it
<br>
doesn't matter when it comes to convincing people: often passion and
<br>
an air of being moral is more encouraging than a barrage of numbers,
<br>
rationality and investment strategies. This is something we should
<br>
bear in mind when debating.  Note that *we* actually have a more
<br>
likely scenario of a green world, but one based on advanced technology
<br>
rather than less technology. But we need to express it more clearly
<br>
and passionately.
