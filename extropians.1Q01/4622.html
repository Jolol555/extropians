<em>&gt; &gt; Very good points, Greg. Also note that in any economic system, demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tends to expand to meet supply, and also that excessive supply over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demand tends to cause waste and a preference for the cheapest supplier,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which invariably tends to be one that externalizes costs to a greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extent than its competition. Maintaining supply/demand balance works to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minimize pollution and waste of resources, something that all greens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (and extropes) should be for, regardless of their economic dogma.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Generally true, but ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're seeing at least one example, today, of an entire industry being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven to the brink by improvements in its own efficiency and competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on price. Agriculture!
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. Industrial improvements in agriculture have put the
<br>
traditional family farm in danger, just as supermarkets and mega-markets
<br>
have endangered the mom and pop corner store. Neither agriculture nor
<br>
the retail sales industry is in any way in danger.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here in the EU, price supports have begun to collapse over the past couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of years. (Those supports, at least in the UK, were originally intended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to provide for self-sufficiency in time of war -- talk about learning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lessons of WW2!)  Agricultural produce prices are falling, and it turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out that we can't easily support an agricultural sector at all. Only about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2% of the population in the UK is directly involved in food production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (but produce roughly 50% of the food required by the entire population).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go back 200 years and it took 80% of the population to produce 100% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the food required. That's a huge improvement in efficiency ... but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers are having horrendous difficulties making ends meet, because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the continuous downward pressure on food prices.
</em><br>
<p>Only family farmers are having trouble. Industrial farms are not. The
<br>
primary problem with prices is that buyers are organized to set prices
<br>
while sellers are not, and the farmers suppliers are also organized to
<br>
control prices better. Typically when like minded and similar sized
<br>
farms band together to control pricing, they do rather well. Industrial
<br>
farms don't mind low prices because it drives their smaller competitors
<br>
under.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A fundamental problem is that people *can't* physically consume much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food; obesity levels are rising, but the main source of new money going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into foodstuffs is spending on luxury goods, prepared items, imported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exotica, and so on. Everyone can afford to eat, and most people can afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to eat what by 1950 standards would be considered a luxury diet. We've got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most intensive, industrialised agricultural system in the EU, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing with third world banana economies -- it can't bring in enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money to operate effectively.
</em><br>
<p>Third world banana economies cannot keep up. One of the primary reasons
<br>
of popular peasant support for the Iranian Revolution, for example, was
<br>
that the farmers in Iran were being decimated by cheap imported US
<br>
wheat, rice, and corn.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we posit a world in which regional economic imbalances have flattened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out, we'll eventually hit a point where downward pressure on food prices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't go any further because if it does there'll be insufficient money to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay for food production -- but consumption os flat. If food is produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at cost, in sufficient quantity and quality for everyone, there is *no*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further room for growth (other than through artificially-induced fashions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fads, which offer transient relief through manufactured scarcity).
</em><br>
<p>This displays a rather dumbfounding display of ignorance of market
<br>
economics.
