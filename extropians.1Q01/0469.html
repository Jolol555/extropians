Phew. Heavy stuff. I guess responding to things like this could turn
<br>
anyone into someone who could be mistaken for an extremist. Thanks.
<br>
<p>Mike
<br>
<p>PS: if the Klan and the nazis are *that* effective, maybe the conspiracy
<br>
theories about crazed gunmen conveniently popping up at politically
<br>
opportune moments have merit, too.
<br>
<p>Attention, everybody: This is not a gun thread. Please do not respond as
<br>
if it were. This is an extremism thread.

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;The best way to know when an extremist is about to attack is to listen to them get indignantly

<em>&gt; &gt;Yes, _very_ true. And, contrariwise, attacks are not the only sign of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;extremism, any more than workplace shootings are the only sign of an
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;That was the source of my question about Morris. Since you've mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;he is a relative, I'd sincerely like to know more about him from you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;some time.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What's he like? How often do you and he come into contact?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, he's a distant cousin, a few times removed, and I've only met him once, about eight years ago, when I was a clinic escort, about years after the Birthday-Present-For-Jesus clinic bombings (the bombers were, amazingly enough, led by Matt Goldsby, the little brother of a chess-playing buddy of mine, A.J. Goldsby).  Dr. David Gunn had been shot to death by Michael Griffin, a troubled fundie undergoing a painful divorce and feelings of worthlessness.  He had volunteered to help John Burt, a local antiabortion leader, former Klansman, and owner of Our Father's House (a home for unwed mothers to surrender their medicaid checks, do chores, absorb fundie rhetoric and get bused to picket clinics) help out around the place, and John fed him propaganda videos and literature for days straight until somehow Mike got the idea that the way to redeem himself before the eyes of God and his family was to sacrifice the rest of his life to become the avenging arm of the Lord.  Morris !

<em>&gt; d long ago made the connection between klansmen and neo-naxis and the antiabortion movement; the KKK and Neos would infiltrate prolifer groups, radicalize them, orient them more towards violence, and then use them to foment discord, which they would subsequently attempt to exploit.  In fact, John Burt had driven a bomber of clinics in Cincinatti by the Ladies' Center a year before to point it out, then evaded a conspiracy charge by claiming it was just on his way and he didn't know the guy did such things; he had also distributed &quot;Wanted&quot; posters of Dr. Gunn.  Morris took the case of Dr. Gunn's surviving wife and children and brought RICO charges against John Burt, claiming that he had wound an emotionally unstable Michael Griffin up like a toy soldier and sent him marching in Dr. Gunn's direction.  Having been sobered by his prison experience (he is serving a life sentence), Griffin was willing to testify as much.  John Burt had, with donations from local churches and wealt!

He agreed to relinquish the property to Dr. Gunn's heirs and to cease and desist from clinic protest in exchange for Morris not pursuing the action.  Sadly, It didn't end there.  A couple of years later, Paul Hill, a &quot;minister&quot; who worked as a car detailer, fatally shotgunned Dr. John Britton and a clinic escort, James Barrett, in the Ladies' !
