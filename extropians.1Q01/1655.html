<em>&gt; It does look like there is no legal case for anyone to prevent use of deep

</em><br>
<p>There might be a legal case there - it could be construed as presenting
<br>
someone else's content as your own, and thus plagarism.  But that's
<br>
about the only way the law wouldn't come down solidly on the side of
<br>
the linker that I've heard of, in most countries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I see no cause for threats when you are simply noting a good article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and putting a link that takes you there. It's strange that some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would object to being handed business that they otherwise wouldn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; received.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to be often more about control of their product than about the
<br>
money.  Same basic principle as behind the suits vs. Napster and the
<br>
DeCSS crowd: &quot;we don't care if you're promoting our product and
<br>
bringing us lots of money; we didn't *authorize* it&quot;.
