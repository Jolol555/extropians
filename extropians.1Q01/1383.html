Odd, I just did a text search of the principals and &quot;unbounded&quot; was
<br>
not found.

<br>

<p><em>&gt;I'm not advocating going back to the stone age. I'm not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advocating a slow-down in research, or trying to prevent people

<p><em>&gt;I'm just saying that new technologies have side-effects, sometimes

</em><br>
<p>I was unaware anyone was advocating this.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You will notice that there is no consensus on the issue.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;On the contrary -- there is a consensus that we oughtn't to wipe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ourselves out. (I think you'd find very few people seriously
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There is a consensus amongst the general public that astrology is
<br>
a pretty neat idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, your question for $64K: why is Extropianism so overtly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associated with unmitigated optimism that it's seen as a joke in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Because people in general are not optimistic? Because we are
<br>
continually being misquoted/misunderstood?
<br>
<p>We advocate a rationaly based technological advancement of the
<br>
species. If we had waited till everyone was satisfied with every
<br>
possible contingency, we would still be swinging from the trees.
