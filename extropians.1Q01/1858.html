Brain Scanning
<br>
<a href="http://www.artificialbrains.com/brainscanning/">http://www.artificialbrains.com/brainscanning/</a>
<br>
Today's state-of-the-art brain scanners use magnetic resonance imaging
<br>
(MRI) to image a living brain to a resolution of ~1mm. At this resolution
<br>
it is not possible to image individual neurons. However, if current rates
<br>
of technological progress continue, it will not be long before we are able
<br>
to scan the location and connectivity of every neuron and synapse in the
<br>
brain. This will vastly increase our understanding of how the brain works
<br>
and even raises the possibility of &quot;downloading&quot; a person's complete mind
<br>
to a computer. Thus, it could be possible to build an artificial brain by
<br>
simply copying, neuron for neuron, a real biological brain.

Brain scanning and the single mind

<br>
Some of my friends have tried to convince me that I should finally quit
<br>
meddling around with psychophysics and graduate to brain scanning. Start
<br>
to solve real problems or really solve the problems I have an interest in!
<br>
Brain scanning techniques are rapidly gaining popularity and many
<br>
laboratories feel second rate when they can't offer suitable facilities.
<br>
Owing to the high cost of such facilities there are complicated issues of
<br>
politics and (social and scientific) status involved. Here I intend to
<br>
address only the potential scientific merits of such methods. I say
<br>
`potential' because state-of-the-art equipment and methods---though
<br>
intricate and expensive---still leave much to be desired. But suppose
<br>
we're already in a more or less ideal situation, that is to say suppose we
<br>
could obtain maps of human brain activity with good spatiotemporal
<br>
resolution in realistic situations. What does this buy us?

The scanner, which will be in use by the fall, is twice as powerful as a
<br>
conventional fMRI and will be the only scanner in use outside of a medical
<br>
setting in the country.
<br>
&quot;We have already been doing some scanning at a nearby facility,&quot; Cohen
<br>
said. &quot;But this scanner is research dedicated. It will have a higher field
<br>
strength.&quot;

For example, if a person scans his brain through a noninvasive
<br>
scanning technology of the twenty-first century (such as an advanced
<br>
magnetic resonance imaging), and downloads his mind to his personal
<br>
computer, is the &quot;person&quot; who emerges in the machine the same
<br>
consciousness as the person who was scanned?

being applied to living cells. Covers both established methods and
<br>
cutting-edge techniques with a wealth of technical detail and practical
<br>
advice. Contains sections on image acquisition and florescence imaging,
