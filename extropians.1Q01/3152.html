Just because the government has bad technology doesn't mean it should be able to
<br>
take it out on us.  The government should just get better technology.
<br>
<p>As soon as I feel like it, I will start actively arguing against FCC regulations
<br>
that I do not like.  There are ways to get all laws changed, for the better.
<br>
Import/export is one thing, but if it's in this country then it's American.
<br>
<p>The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is a &quot;War on the Influence of Drugs&quot;, not against them.  It's
<br>
the only war we've ever had, here, where it is the government against the
<br>
people, or, some of the people.  Drugs should be made legal, to adults.

<em>&gt; War On Drugs Targets Tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Lewis Z. Koch Special To Interactive Week,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The new scapegoat for the failed War on Drugs is, of all things, technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The 120-page December 2000 International Crime Threat Assessment report -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created by basically every federal law enforcement agency in the U.S. - is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; riddled with examples of how computer technology has advanced the cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national and international crime. Modern telecommunications and information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems, state-of-the-art communications equipment, computers - they're all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to blame.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the report fails to squarely acknowledge is that the oil that fuels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organized crime in the U.S. and abroad, including terrorist organizations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is profit from the trade in illegal drugs bound for the U.S. - billions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars in profit from drug sales that enhance the power of international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime cartels and their ability to corrupt police, judges and governmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officials from Tijuana to Tanzania.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Through the use of computers, international criminals have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unprecedented capability to obtain, process and protect information and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sidestep law enforcement investigations,&quot; the report stated. &quot;They can use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the interactive capabilities of advanced computers and telecommunications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems to plot marketing strategies for drugs and other illicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commodities, to find the most efficient routes and methods for smuggling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and moving money in the financial system and to create false trails for law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforcement or banking security.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It goes on to assert: &quot;More threateningly, some criminal organizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appear to be adept at using technology for counterintelligence purposes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for tracking law enforcement activities.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, it's not our flawed drug policy that's to blame - it's new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where All This Began
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1937, Harry J. Anslinger, six years into his 30-year-reign as director
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, testified before the U.S. Senate on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behalf of the &quot;Marihuana Tax Act.&quot; This delighted the Hearst newspapers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which, lacking a real war to increase newspaper sales, launched an all-out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battle against demon marijuana. Here are a few excerpts from Anslinger's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sworn testimony. Clearly, our drug policy traces its roots to reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was as racist and alarmist as it was wildly inaccurate:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * &quot;There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana can cause white women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * &quot;The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; races.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * &quot;Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminality and death.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * &quot;Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With Hearst's backing, Anslinger's war on marijuana escalated to an all-out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war on narcotics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, after six and a half decades of speeches and hundreds of thousands,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps millions, of arrests, convictions and sentences, what signs point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to even modest success in this multitrillion-dollar war against drugs? Drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trafficking is the most profitable of all illegal activities, according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the International Crime Threat Assessment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where Do We Go from Here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead of rethinking the sanity of our basic policy on drugs, federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police agencies appear bent on blaming technology - unbreakable encryption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via e-mail, encrypted cellular phones and faster, cheaper networked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers - for the losses sustained in the drug war. This is clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1999 alone, Americans spent an estimated $63 billion on illegal drugs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. And the National
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute on Drug Abuse stated: &quot;The estimated total cost of drug abuse in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States - including health care and lost productivity - was $110
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion in 1995, the latest year for which data is available.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In addition, a U.S. Customs Service report said the department will soon be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to inspect only 1 percent of all goods entering the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the score after six and a half decades of our drug policy. Do we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to wait until 2037 to recognize that we lost the Hundred Years' Drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War? And,! in the meantime, will we see more and more attacks on technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the evil ally of narcotics?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The obvious yet politically difficult solution here is to remove the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profitability factor from drugs. Will there be more casualties? Will more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people succumb to addiction? Maybe. But don't we already have casualties?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have to employ some tortured logic to rationalize how removing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profit incentive from drug use could make things any worse than they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now the Feds want to escalate the war as an excuse for having their way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with encryption. But encryption is an essential business tool and a means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of protecting our privacy. Outlawing it as a scapegoat of our drug policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is like trembling in fear before the great Wizard of Oz and paying no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to the discredited man and his policies behind the curtain.
