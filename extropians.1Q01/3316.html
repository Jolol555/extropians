I'd call you a raging optimist.
<br>
<p>&quot;And if you wanna breathe you gotta buy his air...&quot;
<br>
<p>Also, keep in mind any earthside government could nuke the whole 
<br>
works with relative impunity--nobody's gonna start a nukewar on earth 
<br>
over a bit of slagged Martian real estate.
<br>
<p>&quot;He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing.&quot;
<br>
<p>Food for thought.
