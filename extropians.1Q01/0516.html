From: J. R. Molloy
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course SI is all hypothetical stuff, but what the hell, let's talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about it anyway.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I find the subject highly entertaining.
<br>
<p>I see no reason why a SI should wipe out humanity.
<br>
<p>The first thing I would do when uploaded would be to leave the gravity well,
<br>
and start mining the solar system for raw materials for a bigger and faster
<br>
brain. Until I was the brightest object in the sky so to speak ;-)
<br>
<p>So much wealth up there and so little time.
<br>
<p>Why should I bother about the earth? There is too much energy and materal
<br>
elsewhere and I wouldn't have to fight no one to get it either. Well not in
<br>
the beginning anyway.
<br>
<p>I guess that other uploads would do the same. There would still be limits in
<br>
growth due to the speed of light, though massively parallel use of nanotech
<br>
could help on that. But probably a better use of my time would be to make my
<br>
brain smarter instead of just making it bigger.
<br>
<p>I don't see why I should stay on earth to do that either.
<br>
<p>Most likely the best strategy would be some kind of tradeoff between a lot
<br>
of different factors. Brain speed, Intelligence level, production
<br>
capability, growth speed etc. to name a few, including some I cannot even
<br>
comprehend now.
<br>
<p>But why I should even bother to look back on earth I don't know.
<br>
<p>It could be fun to play out a scenario based on SI and it's spreading in the
<br>
Solar system. But I must agree with Eliezer that if Nano comes before SI we
<br>
can be in grave trouble.
