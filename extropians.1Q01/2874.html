</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not that for me.  It is more practical of how we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finance the escapade, how it will become self-supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and whether it will actually do what we would like it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do as far as being a &quot;backup&quot; for instance.
</em><br>
<p>Agree. But to start with, a significant increase in the public perception of
<br>
the importance of space exploration/colonization would be welcome. Followed
<br>
by a significantly increased budget for organizations like NASA, giving them
<br>
a more central role as a public project, rather than the obscure position
<br>
they currently hold. I think space exploration/colonization projects should
<br>
have at least the significance that they had during the 'space race' in the
<br>
1960s.
<br>
<p>Regarding who would finance Mars colonization: well, there's 6 billion of
<br>
us. Finance == work. I don't have sufficient global overview to claim that
<br>
we're ready for colonization immediately, but I'm sure the world can afford
<br>
more than 1 human expedition per 10 years. I mean, there's 6 billion of us,
<br>
and we've got a whole planet of resources - and doing this is a matter of
<br>
preserving our civilization! So, can we afford it? Yes, I think we can. I
<br>
don't see resources as a problematic issue - the public perception of the
<br>
importance of such a project is the primary limiting factor.
<br>
<p>Regarding what we could expect from a &quot;backup civilization&quot;: one contributor
<br>
to this mailing list noted that such a backup colony would have the same (or
<br>
perhaps even more?) technology as we do here, and would hence be subject to
<br>
the same dangers as we are. But I nevertheless think there is benefit in
<br>
duplication - two come immediately to mind:
<br>
&nbsp;- A catastrophe in one of the civilizations will cause the other
<br>
civilization to rethink what it's doing, and act accordingly. E.g.: Earth
<br>
wipes itself out as a consequence of action X -&gt; Mars makes sure to prevent
<br>
action X from happening.
<br>
&nbsp;- Dangerous technologies (like NT) can be developed and thoroughly tested
<br>
in far-away places rather than on Earth, even before a full-blown
<br>
civilization is developed in those places.
<br>
<p>Sure, you're right that colonizing another planet is a rather large
<br>
undertaking. But I don't see a reason why we can't start working on it right
<br>
now, and I do see some reasons why taking it too slowly might not be a smart
<br>
choice.
<br>
<p>[I'm quite sure such a project would also be a source of great excitement
<br>
for a good portion of the human race - wouldn't you be excited about it? -
<br>
but that is not the primary logical foundation for doing it: the primary
<br>
logical foundation is in the principle of &quot;not putting all of one's eggs in
<br>
a single basket&quot;.]
