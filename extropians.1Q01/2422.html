<p>Hmm.
<br>
<p>I think this is a very deep, tough, and controversial issue. If we had a
<br>
catholic priest here to discuss this with [&quot;thank god we don't&quot; :) ], this
<br>
would be a tough discussion.
<br>
<p>Overall, I think the preprogrammed nature of the school system as we have it
<br>
(the concept is the same over there as it is here) is a problem in itself.
<br>
The basic premise of education is that adults determine what kids should
<br>
learn, and then these facts are rammed down children's throats. And kids who
<br>
can't cope with this awful approach are deemed &quot;problematic&quot;. Be it creation
<br>
science or evolution - ideally, kids would learn what they want to learn, at
<br>
the time they want to learn it. [Although it probably does get more
<br>
complicated than that.]
<br>
<p>I think your assertion - &quot;such flexibility would lead...&quot; - is largely
<br>
irrelevant, because what is taught in schools is probably not what is
<br>
&quot;right&quot;, it is what the majority wants kids to be taught. As in most human
<br>
conflicts, the decisive arguments here are arguments of force, not arguments
<br>
of reason.
<br>
<p>You and I are fortunate enough that what is taught in schools is largely
<br>
(but definitely not entirely) compatible with the way we think. Catholic
<br>
priests are, well, less fortunate.
<br>
<p>Just my 2.35 Yen.
