<em>&gt; &gt; Harmless by your definition, not mine.  If you ever get a chance to

<em>&gt; &gt; talk to a woman who's been raped, or forcefully groped, ask her if
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In what way is a flan in the face comparable to rape?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'll take this opportunity to point out a common mistake people make during 
<br>
a debate.
<br>
I say: your position in support of such-and-such is ridiculous. If what you 
<br>
said was true, that would mean that it's ok to kill people.
<br>
You respond: Huh? Such-and-such is completely different from murder.
<br>
[What I would mean if I said this is that, insofar as far as I understand 
<br>
your premises by which you derive support for such-and-such, you can derive 
<br>
a support for murder from those same premises. This would be my attempt to 
<br>
prove you wrong by showing a contradiction in your premises (since we all 
<br>
believe murder is wrong and to support it is a contradiction). If I am 
<br>
wrong, it is either because I misunderstood the premises from which you 
<br>
derived support for such-and-such, in which case you should now explain your 
<br>
premises more clearly, or because I mis-applied logic in getting from your 
<br>
premises to the conclusion of murder, in which case you should point out 
<br>
where. What you understood by my statement, however, is that I was trying to 
<br>
just use an emotional tie-in between murder and such-and-such, to get people 
<br>
to reject such-and such].
<br>
<p>But anyway, of course rape and pie-in-the face differ enormously in scale.
<br>
Here's something comprable more comprable in scale: animal rights protesters 
<br>
who throw (fake) blood at people wearing fur. Is this acceptable?
<br>
There is some guy in the US South who protests outside the funerals of 
<br>
people who died of AIDS, holding up signs which say &quot;AIDS cures fags&quot;. If 
<br>
this guy started throwing pies at people leaving the funeral home, would 
<br>
this be acceptable? I think it's comprable - he has a certain political 
<br>
opinion that certain people are bad, and maybe who he feels they &quot;take 
<br>
themselves too seriously&quot;. He'd be throwing a pie at them to humiliate them.
<br>
Throwing symbolic &quot;fetus pies&quot; at women leaving abortion clinics?
<br>
When I use these examples I think it becomes more clear that any initiation 
<br>
of force, no matter how slight, is bad.
<br>
<p>Of course, it is just a pie. I can think of a few peices of real damage it 
<br>
would cause. First, it's going to ruin your shirt.
