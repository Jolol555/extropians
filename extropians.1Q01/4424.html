<p>He was miffed because of media portrayals of millennium nuts as being 
<br>
mostly nuttier varieties of Christianity.  Unfortunately for him, it was
<br>
largely true, as non-Christians don't attach much importance to arbitrary
<br>
numbers in a Christian dating system.  I assume he wasn't referring to 
<br>
the Y2K &quot;nuts&quot; as that was a different issue and they weren't portrayed
<br>
as particularly Christian, because they weren't.
<br>
<p>The speech conflates several different issues - some cases of ridiculous
<br>
behavior, like punishing the 8-year-old kisser, with some not-so-
<br>
ridiculous cases, like the media portrayals of millenium nuts.  Standard
<br>
rhetorical tactic for building support for your side of certain issues -
<br>
link it to other issues where no reasonable person would disagree with
<br>
you.
