Samantha,
<br>
<p>I think you're being too critical of Eliezer's explanation for changing his 
<br>
estimate to 2008.  As I recall the conversation, Eli said he'd revised his 
<br>
personal projection about how soon the Singularity was likely to occur and 
<br>
someone else asked him what his reasons were.  This is very different from 
<br>
asking him to defend his projection or to convince anyone else of it.  
<br>
Eliezer listed his reasons, and I took them in that spirit: they might be 
<br>
tentative conclusions, they might be based on private information, they 
<br>
might be intended as conservative guesses.
<br>
<p>Asking (seemed like demanding to me) him to come up with schedules and 
<br>
budgets in order to convince you goes beyond what he offered.  If you were 
<br>
to ask if he can defend those beliefs, you'd be on more solid ground.
<br>
<p>That said, I agree with you that some of his reasoning seems speculative 
<br>
and optimistic at best.  But given  point 4:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I stopped thinking in terms of &quot;What is the precise degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ludicrousness involved in the thought of my ever getting a cent from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Social Security?&quot; and shifted to &quot;When do I need to do something if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to do it before the Singularity?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I have trouble debating the whole argument.  What's your *conservative* 
<br>
estimate of when you need to finish up any major projects if they should be 
<br>
done before the singularity?  What if you felt as strongly as Eliezer does 
<br>
that it's crucial that you win the race?
<br>
<p>Chris
