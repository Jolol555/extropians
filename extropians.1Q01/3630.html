<p>
Sarcopenia, or muscle loss, is one of the hallmarks of aging.  By the
<br>
time you reach your seventies, you will likely have lost 20% of the
<br>
skeletal muscle mass you had in your 20's.   The loss of muscle mass
<br>
reduces your resting metabolic rate, which makes it increasingly
<br>
difficult to burn fat.
<br>
<p>Result:  middle age spread.
<br>
<p>In addition, the enervation of remaining muscles also declines with age,
<br>
leading to reduced coordination.  Decreased strength and coordination in
<br>
turn lead to increased risk of falls, and reduced ability to perform
<br>
even simple tasks of daily living (such as getting out of a chair, or
<br>
carrying groceries).

<p>Calorie Restriction Reduces Age Related Muscle Loss

<p>However, individuals like Clarence Bass demonstrate that muscle loss can
<br>
largely be prevented by a low calorie density diet and a program of
<br>
resistance training.  He has a better body at 60+ than I do at 28.  See

<p>New Evidence On Sets Controversy
<br>
<p>The ink was barely dry on last month's &quot;One Set Or Many?&quot; article when
<br>
thought provoking comments across the spectrum began to arrive. What's
<br>
more, newly released research answers the two main criticisms of
<br>
studies showing no significant difference in strength or size gains as
<br>
a result of doing one set compared to multiple sets.
<br>
<p>One man scoffed that the &quot;one-set-to failure&quot; theory was devised by
<br>
Arthur Jones to sell his expensive Nautilus machines to gym owners who
<br>
had to have a high turnover of members to make any money. &quot;[They]
<br>
could not have someone using a $2000 pullover machine for 5 sets of 10
<br>
reps,&quot; he contends.  According to this man, &quot;The bottom line
<br>
... rationale for short workouts was $$$$$.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the other side, a fellow wrote that abbreviated workouts have
</em><br>
been &quot;especially helpful&quot; to him, because they &quot;allow time for other
<br>
pursuits while sacrificing nothing in effectiveness.&quot;
<br>
<p>A third man, obviously a skeptic, complained: &quot;The one set wonders
<br>
don't think to mention their warm-up sets.&quot;
<br>
<p>The same man recommended that I read Arthur Drechsler's discussion of
<br>
the sets controversy in The Weightlifting Encyclopedia (see our
<br>
Products section under Recommended Books). I did. Artie makes some
<br>
sophisticated points that we all would be well advised to keep in
<br>
mind.
<br>
<p>Drechsler observes that whether one set or multiple sets are optimal
<br>
often depends on what you're trying to accomplish. For instance, if
<br>
you are training for an event that requires repeated bouts of effort,
<br>
multiple sets may be indicated.
<br>
<p>Another approach, however, would be to rely on sports specific
<br>
training - and not weights - to develop endurance. If you're training
<br>
for football, wind sprints or scrimmaging is probably the best way to
<br>
develop the stamina to play hard in the fourth quarter. Remember that
<br>
specificity is the guiding principle in all athletic training.
<br>
<p>Artie Drechsler also reminds us that individual differences come into
<br>
play. &quot;...Some athletes may benefit from a greater training stimulus
<br>
[more sets] that other athletes,&quot; says Drechsler.
<br>
<p>I agree. Another e-mail made essentially the same point. It read:
<br>
&quot;Maybe [the fact that] Bill Pearl and Arnold Schwarznegger could do
<br>
more volume and continue to get stronger and bigger is [the reason]
<br>
why they left most of the rest in the dust.&quot;
<br>
<p>Drechsler goes on: &quot;Obviously there is a point where more training
<br>
does not increase the training stimulus.&quot; Right, and that may be one
<br>
all-out set for some and 3 or 4 work sets for others. &quot;Know thyself,&quot;
<br>
as the Oracles preached.
<br>
<p>The number of reps in a set also has a bearing on the appropriate
<br>
number of sets. Artie explains: &quot;Since weightlifters need to perform
<br>
relatively low reps in training (and especially in competition) they
<br>
will typically need to employ more set to achieve their ends than
<br>
someone who is performing five, ten, or twenty reps in a set.&quot;
<br>
Explaining further, Drechsler says, &quot;There is now scientific evidence
<br>
that more muscle fibers are activated on a maximum set of five reps
<br>
than on a maximum single. From this it follows that a maximum set of
<br>
high reps is more likely to stimulate a maximal training effect than a
<br>
maximum single.&quot;
<br>
<p>Right again. I've often said, if you want to do a second maximum set
<br>
of 20 reps in the squat, there's something wrong. You either didn't go
<br>
hard enough in the first set, or you're nuts.
<br>
<p>New Studies Answer Critics
<br>
<p>Artie Drechsler's points may help to explain why research on the set
<br>
question is inconclusive. As my earlier article said, a review of
<br>
literature by Carpinelli and Otto found that 33 out of 35
<br>
strength-training studies showed no significant difference in strength
<br>
or size gains as a result of doing one set or multiple sets. (Sports
<br>
Medicine. 25(7): 1998) The two main criticisms of these studies,
<br>
according to Dr. Carpinelli, are that they were too short, and that
<br>
the participants were often untrained. The suggestion is that seasoned
<br>
trainers might benefit from doing more sets.
<br>
<p>Dr. Carpinelli now reports in the October 1998 Master Trainer that
<br>
those &quot;valid criticisms&quot; are addressed in a series of studies by
<br>
Michael Pollock, M.D., and his colleagues at the University of
<br>
Florida, and another research group.
<br>
<p>Five studies by Dr. Pollock's group were presented at the annual
<br>
meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine. Four of them
<br>
address the duration issue; they extend for six months compared to
<br>
only six to 12 weeks in the earlier studies.
<br>
<p>Two of the studies (Medicine and Science in Sports and
<br>
Exercise. Supplement 30(5); 116 &amp; 165, 1998) examine strength and size
<br>
increases as a result of one set or three sets of 8-12 repetitions to
<br>
muscular failure three days a week. Strength was assessed for both one
<br>
rep max and reps at 75% of pretraining max, in the bench press, row,
<br>
arm curl, leg extension and leg curl. Muscle thickness increases were
<br>
measured by ultrasound in eight locations covering the upper and lower
<br>
body.
<br>
<p>The researchers found almost identical increases in upper and lower
<br>
body thickness for both the one-set (13.6%) and three-set (13.12%)
<br>
groups. Increases in one rep maximum were also essentially the same,
<br>
for all five exercises, but the principle of specificity asserted
<br>
itself on one exercise when it came to maximum reps or endurance. Both
<br>
groups showed significant across-the- board increases in endurance,
<br>
but the 3-set group showed significantly greater improvement in the
<br>
bench press. At 25 weeks, the one-set group averaged 22 reps in the
<br>
bench press compared to 27 for those doing 3-sets.
<br>
<p>The third 6-month study by the Pollock group (Medicine and Science in
<br>
Sports and Exercise. Supplement 30(5): S163, 1998) focused on
<br>
increases in knee-extension strength in three different modes: one-rep
<br>
max, isometric peak torque and training weight. Again, there was no
<br>
significant difference between the one-set and three-set
<br>
groups. One-rep max increased 33.3% and 31.6% for 1 set and 3 sets,
<br>
respectively; isometric increases were 35.4% versus 32.1%; and
<br>
training weight increases were 25.6% compared to 14.7%
<br>
<p>Even though the researchers apparently didn't find it significant,
<br>
note that the one-set group gained slightly more strength in the first
<br>
two modes and substantially more in training weight (25.6% versus
<br>
14.7%). It seems to me that specificity is at work again. When you do
<br>
only one set there's nothing to keep you from doing your absolute
<br>
best; but when you plan to do three sets it's natural to hold back and
<br>
pace yourself. I believe that's probably why the one-set group gained
<br>
more strength. They triggered more muscle fibers than the 3-set group,
<br>
where pacing probably reduced intensity somewhat.
<br>
<p>The fourth study by the Pollock group (Medicine and Science in Sports
<br>
and Exercise. Supplement 30(5): S274, 1998), also 6 months long,
<br>
showed significant increases in circulating insulin-like growth
<br>
factors (IGFs) in both one-set (34%) and three-set (30%) groups. Dr.
<br>
Carpinelli, who teaches the neuromuscular aspects of strength training
<br>
at Adelphi University (Long Island, New York), says, &quot;IGFs are
<br>
multifunctional protein hormones, whose production in the liver and
<br>
other tissues is stimulated by growth hormones.&quot; They are important
<br>
because, &quot;They stimulate glucose and amino acid uptake, protein and
<br>
DNA synthesis, and growth of bones, cartilage, and soft tissue.&quot;
<br>
<p>The researchers concluded: &quot;The elevation of IGFs is no greater with
<br>
high- than low-volume resistance training.&quot; That's noteworthy, because
<br>
it's generally believed that high-set training results in more growth
<br>
hormone secretion. (See Growth Hormone Synergism by Douglas M.  Crist,
<br>
Ph.D., 2nd Edition, 1991; you'll find this book listed in our Products
<br>
section under Recommended Books.)
<br>
<p>The final study by the Pollock group (Medicine and Science in Sports
<br>
and Exercise. Supplement 30(5): S115, 1998) addresses the training
<br>
experience issue. As you'll recall, some have suggested that
<br>
experienced trainers might benefit from higher volume. In other words,
<br>
after you've been training for a while, you need increased volume to
<br>
continue progressing - more is better. According to this study, those
<br>
people should think anew.
<br>
<p>The researchers recruited 40 adults who had been performing one set to
<br>
muscular fatigue, using nine exercises, for a minimum of one year;
<br>
average training time was six years. The participants were randomly
<br>
assigned to either a one-set or three-set group; both groups did 8-12
<br>
reps to failure three days per week for 13 weeks.
<br>
<p>Both groups significantly increased their one-rep maximum strength and
<br>
endurance. There was no significant difference in the gains made by
<br>
the two groups in the leg extension, leg curl, bench press, overhead
<br>
press and arm curl. The researchers concluded: &quot;These data indicate
<br>
that 1 set of [resistance training] is equally as beneficial as 3 sets
<br>
in experienced resistance trained adults.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another research group, K.L. Ostrowski and colleagues, tested &quot;the
<br>
effect of weight training volume on hormonal output and muscular size
<br>
and function&quot; in experienced trainers. (Journal of Strength and
<br>
Conditioning Research. 11(3): 148-154, 1997) Thirty-five males, with
<br>
one to four years weight-training experience, were assigned to one of
<br>
three training groups: one-set, two-sets, or four sets. All
<br>
participants did what I would call a periodized routine; they changed
<br>
the rep range every few weeks. They did free-weight exercises four
<br>
times a week for ten weeks using 12 reps maximum (week 1-4), 7 reps
<br>
max (week 5-7) and 9 reps (week 8-10). All sets were performed to
<br>
muscular fatigue with three minutes rest between sets. The only
<br>
difference between the three programs was the number of sets.
<br>
<p>As in the Pollock group studies, no significant differences in results
<br>
were found. The authors concluded: &quot;...A low volume program ...  [one
<br>
set of each exercise] ... results in increases in muscle size and
<br>
function similar to programs with two to four times as much volume.&quot;
<br>
<p>Significantly, regarding hormone output, they concluded: &quot;High volume
<br>
[four sets of each exercise] may result in a shift in the
<br>
testosterone/cortisol (anabolic/catabolic) ratio in some individuals,
<br>
suggesting the possibility of overtraining.&quot; In other words,
<br>
high-volume training not only doesn't produce better results, it may
<br>
also lead to overtraining.
<br>
<p>The Bottom Line
<br>
<p>After considering this new evidence, Dr. Ralph Carpinelli sums-up:
<br>
&quot;The lack of scientific evidence that multiple sets...produce a
<br>
greater increase in strength or size, in itself, provides a rationale
<br>
for following a single set training protocol.&quot;
<br>
<p>That seems to be where we are today based on the latest peer-reviewed
<br>
scientific evidence. Unless you're training to accomplish a task that
<br>
must be repeated over and over, there appears to be no good reason for
<br>
most people to spend hours in the gym doing set after set. Volume
<br>
training works, as my last article concluded, but in most cases the
<br>
strength and size gains are no better than result from warming-up and
<br>
performing one hard set.
<br>
<p>The choice is yours.
