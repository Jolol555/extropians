<p>The basic problem here is that once you start giving a resource away for
<br>
free, and the resource is limited, you have to restrain access to the
<br>
resource. In this case: if you don't prevent idle people from multiplying,
<br>
they will multiply until they exhaust the capacities you can provide, at
<br>
which time the situation will be the same as it is now - only worse because
<br>
there will be even more people.
<br>
<p>If we were to provide people with guaranteed income, be it nano-generated
<br>
resources or plain old money, external birth control is a must. The universe
<br>
is finite, so the number of people must remain so as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In a sense, but, pre-nanotech, the notion is that the GI

</em><br>
<p>By nature, people are lazy. Given just enough to scrape by on, a culture may
<br>
soon develop in which the vast majority would do exactly that. Children born
<br>
into such a society would know inactivity as the only way to live. You've
<br>
probably been to Egypt or a similar country; that is it. People were born
<br>
into an atmosphere of idleness, and they don't know any better.
<br>
<p>The trick might be to engineer people to have less simplistic desires. To
<br>
engineer people who have a desire for action, rather than aversion against
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>And then the additional caveat would be to introduce all these controls and
<br>
engineering attempts in a way that does not directly do harm to people who
<br>
already exist. I.e.: engineering to produce a smarter and better homo
<br>
sapiens is good. On the other hand, killing people you perceive to be stupid
<br>
is not good.
