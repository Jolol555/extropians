<p>
An orthogonal view of architecture to that of Soleri is provided by 
<br>
Christopher Alexander.  Alexander believes that the strongest constructions 
<br>
(the best places to live or work) are those that have developed 
<br>
organically.  In his work, he has attempted to codify all the forces that 
<br>
come into play at varying levels of abstraction (from design of a doorway 
<br>
to regional planning of highways).  He then does design, taking into 
<br>
account all the patterns he has captured, leaving room in the process for 
<br>
the various parts of the developing entity to inform each other so that the 
<br>
result can be much more than the result of one person's ability to foresee 
<br>
all the affects ahead of time.
<br>
<p>It's at least a start at a theory of how to design in a way that allows the 
<br>
inhabitants and users of a space to adapt the built environment to their 
<br>
own needs and tastes.
<br>
<p>There's a sub-culture in software development (within Object-Oriented 
<br>
Programming) that has stolen the theme from Alexander and started 
<br>
developing similar catalogs of patterns of forces at varying levels of 
<br>
abstraction.  Alexander gave a talk at Stanford in November on the 
<br>
implications for software of his ideas.  (He apologised for not 
<br>
understanding software better.)  He apparently has more readers these days 
<br>
in the software community than in architecture.  Like Soleri, he's never 
<br>
gotten much respect or attention from his peers.
