</em><br>
<p><p>Any version, take your pick.  Windows in all its incarnations has never
<br>
been a multiuser environment.  Take a look at the odd and ugly hack that is
<br>
Citrix Winframe, trying to (badly) get the same multiuser capability out of
<br>
Windows that has been a basic feature of Unix for ages (e.g. X).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; However, SQL Server I do love; version 7 is fabulous. I don't know what DBAs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of it; I know it requires you to replace the Oracle style architecture
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Oracle has a great core engine surrounded by tools and development toys
<br>
that are totally ass.  Hence why there is a thriving market for
<br>
third-party Oracle development tools, many of which are as good as you
<br>
will find on any database platform.  SQL Server has the reverse situation,
<br>
with lots of reasonably decent development tools surrounding a core engine
<br>
that is still pretty lame (though v7 is quantum improvement over v6.5). 
<br>
Since a business runs on the core engine, not on the development tools,
<br>
Oracle is still widely preferred by most management teams.  After all,
<br>
good tools can be purchased for Oracle as well (just not from Oracle). 
<br>
Also from a management standpoint, Oracle is extraordinarily portable and
<br>
can be migrated with minimal effort to *really big* systems -- no code
<br>
rewrites to change platforms.
<br>
<p>I should also point out that while simple database development can be
<br>
accomplished using GUI tools, there are many things in the database world
<br>
for which there is no substitute for dropping to a rich CLI shell to run
<br>
complicated scripts.  Like Oracle SQL*Plus on a Unix character terminal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the standpoint of a DBA/SA on really large database systems, I would
</em><br>
take Oracle over SQL Server any day.  Oracle has been doing these types of
<br>
systems far longer than Microsoft, and ultimately, managing giant complex
<br>
systems from any Windows system is painful.
<br>
<p>Of course, there is more than just Oracle and SQL Server.  DB2 for
<br>
instance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Borland Delphi is sweet, beautiful, GUI based and proud. 
</em><br>
<p><p>This really is a superior product for GUI application development.  I am
<br>
looking forward to the Unix versions I've heard are coming out.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Nowadays I'm writing ASP to talk directly to a database. We're not using a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle tier :-(, but jscript, as the scripting language, is turning out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be incredibly efficient (compared to how I expected it to perform); I wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a SQL Server -&gt; Oracle sql translator so that we could support multiple dbs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more easily, and I never notice any performance hit, which is surprising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I never designed for speed, and I'm pretty sure the thing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computationally intensive.
</em><br>
<p><p>Perhaps the fact that you are using ASP puts the SQL translation below the
<br>
performance noise floor. :^)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'm really happy with the current state of the Microsoft OSes, although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish they could finally drop the 9x kernel. They're good to program on. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do lots of great stuff for you.
</em><br>
<p><p>This really depends on what kind of programming you are doing.  Some of
<br>
the low-level stuff in those OSes are really pretty awful.  The APIs are
<br>
far too rich (and broken in some fashion a third of the time), and there
<br>
are way too many odd and complicated side effects.   Look at the thread
<br>
APIs/model on NT if you want an example of a diseased design and
<br>
implementation.  I've done parallel development on Windows NT and Unix; I
<br>
spent far more time fscking with the Windows specific code than the Unix
<br>
specific code because there were a lot more things that could go wrong. 
<br>
The beauty of Unix is that it *doesn't* try and do a lot of great stuff
<br>
for you.
