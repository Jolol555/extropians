<p><p><p><p><p><p>Book proposal adds to ‘IT’ mystery
<br>
<p>Invention said to be bigger than PCs and the Internet
<br>
<p>By PJ Mark
<br>
INSIDE.COM
<br>
<p>Jan. 9 — Harvard Business School Press executive editor Hollis Heimbouch has 
<br>
just paid $250,000 for a book about IT — but neither the editor nor the 
<br>
agent, Dan Kois of The Sagalyn Literary Agency, knows what IT is.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALL THEY DO know: IT, also code-named Ginger, is an invention 
<br>
developed by 49-year-old scientist Dean Kamen, and the subject of a planned 
<br>
book by journalist Steve Kemper. According to Kemper’s proposal, IT will 
<br>
change the world, and is so extraordinary that it has drawn the attention of 
<br>
technology visionaries Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs and the investment dollars 
<br>
of pre-eminent Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr, among others.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemper — who has been published in Smithsonian, National Geographic 
<br>
and Outside among others — has had exclusive access to Kamen and the 
<br>
engineers at his New Hampshire-based research and development company, DEKA, 
<br>
for the past year and a half. He tags the proposed book as Soul of the New 
<br>
Machine meets The New New Thing and won over his agent and publisher with 
<br>
e-mails describing the project in carefully couched language. He also 
<br>
included an amusing narrative of a meeting between Bezos, Jobs, Doerr and 
<br>
Kamen.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposal, Doerr calls Kamen — who was just awarded the 
<br>
National Medal of Technology, the country’s highest such award — a 
<br>
combination of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. Doerr also says, a touch 
<br>
ominously, that he had been sure that he wouldn’t see the development of 
<br>
anything in his lifetime as important as the World Wide Web — until he saw 
<br>
IT. According to the proposal, another investor, Credit Suisse First Boston, 
<br>
expects Kamen’s invention to make more money in its first year than any 
<br>
start-up in history, predicting Kamen will be worth more in five years than 
<br>
Bill Gates. Jobs told Kamen the invention would be as significant as the PC, 
<br>
the proposal says.

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though there are no specifics in the proposal as to what the 
<br>
invention is, there are some tantalizing clues. Is IT an energy source? Some 
<br>
sort of environmentally friendly personal transport device? One editor who 
<br>
saw the proposal went as far as to speculate — jokingly (perhaps) — that IT 
<br>
was a type of personal hovering craft.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the following items, culled from the proposal:
<br>
IT is not a medical invention.
<br>
In a private meeting with Bezos, Jobs and Doerr, Kamen assembled two Gingers 
<br>
— or ITs — in 10 minutes, using a screwdriver and hex wrenches from 
<br>
components that fit into a couple of large duffel bags and some cardboard 
<br>
boxes.
<br>
The invention has a fun element to it, because once a Ginger was turned on, 
<br>
Bezos started laughing his “loud, honking laugh”.
<br>
There are possibly two Ginger models, named Metro and Pro — and the Metro 
<br>
may possibly cost less than $2,000.
<br>
Bezos is quoted as saying that IT “...is a product so revolutionary, you’ll 
<br>
have no problem selling it. The question is, are people going to be allowed 
<br>
to use it?”
<br>
Jobs is quoted as saying: “...If enough people see the machine you won’t 
<br>
have to convince them to architect cities around it. It’ll just happen.”
<br>
Kemper says the invention will “sweep over the world and change lives, 
<br>
cities, and ways of thinking.”
<br>
The “core technology and its implementations” will, according to Kamen, 
<br>
“have a big, broad impact not only on social institutions but some 
<br>
billion-dollar old-line companies.” And the invention will “profoundly 
<br>
affect our environment and the way people live worldwide. It will be an 
<br>
alternative to products that are dirty, expensive, sometimes dangerous and 
<br>
often frustrating, especially for people in the cities.”
<br>
IT will be a mass-market consumer product “likely to run afoul of existing 
<br>
regulations and or inspire new ones,” according to Kemper. The invention 
<br>
will also likely require “meeting with city planners, regulators, 
<br>
legislators, large commercial companies and university presidents about how 
<br>
cities, companies and campuses can be retro-fitted for Ginger.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invention itself is as interesting as the inventor. Kamen — “a 
<br>
true eccentric, cantankerous and opinionated, a great character,” according 
<br>
to the proposal — dropped out of college in his 20s, then invented the first 
<br>
drug infusion pump; he later created the first portable insulin pump and 
<br>
dialysis machine.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kamen, an avid aviator who commutes via a helicopter, is also the 
<br>
founder of FIRST — For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology 
<br>
— a nonprofit organization that encourages young people to pursue studies 
<br>
and careers in math and science. He’s a single man obsessed with his work 
<br>
and out of touch with popular culture. According to the proposal, Kamen was 
<br>
seated at a White House dinner next to two people he’d never heard of: 
<br>
Shirley MacLaine and Warren Beatty.

<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kamen’s most recent invention is the iBot, an off-road wheelchair 
<br>
that can climb stairs, cover sand and gravel and rise to balance on two 
<br>
wheels. A prototype iBot was showcased by wheelchair-bound journalist John 
<br>
Hockenberry at least year’s TED conference in Monterrey, Calif.; the 
<br>
demonstration was greeted by wild applause.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT/Ginger won’t be revealed until 2002, the proposal says. No one has 
<br>
seen the project except Kamen, Kemper, the engineers and the investors — 
<br>
which include Doerr, a partner in the venture capital firm of Kleiner 
<br>
Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, which helped launch Netscape, Amazon, Juniper 
<br>
Networks, Excite, and @Home, among others; and Michael Schmertzler, managing 
<br>
director of Credit Suisse First Boston. Others who have seen the invention 
<br>
and signed confidentiality agreements include minor investors Paul Allaire, 
<br>
CEO of Xerox; and Vern Loucks, recently retired CEO of Baxter. Bezos, Jobs 
<br>
and writer/venture capitalist Randy Komisar sit on the advisory board. Kamen 
<br>
retains 85 percent of his new company, according to the proposal.
<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the secrecy? Kamen fears, as he states in a letter to Kemper that 
<br>
is included in the proposal, that “huge corporations” might catch wind of 
<br>
the invention and “use their massive resources to erect obstacles against us 
<br>
or, worse, simply appropriate the technology by assigning hundreds of 
<br>
engineers to catch up to us, and thousands of employees to produce it in 
<br>
their plants.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such secrecy may have been enough to turn publishers away. “The 
<br>
Internet changed the world, too” said one editor who considered the project, 
<br>
“but books about it don’t really sell.” As for the quarter-million-dollar 
<br>
price tag for North American rights: on the one hand, it doesn’t seem to be 
<br>
a lot for a book about an invention which has mesmerized such well-known 
<br>
technology moguls. On the other, $250,000 is a lot to pay for a story about 
<br>
a product that hasn’t been seen, defined or named.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We were well aware of Kamen,” says book editor Heimbouch, who says 
<br>
she’s been publishing in this technology circle for a long time.” (The 
<br>
bestselling The Monk and the Riddle: The Education of a Silicon Valley 
<br>
Entrepreneur by Komisar is hers.) So jumping on board for the book wasn’t 
<br>
such a dilemma. Besides, says Heimbouch, Harvard Business School Press had 
<br>
intended to approach Kamen about doing a book anyway. “He’s an inventor of 
<br>
great technologies that make people’s lives better,” she says.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvard Business School Press, a division of Harvard Business School 
<br>
Publishing, is a wholly owned , not for profit subsidiary of Harvard 
<br>
University. The Sagalyn Agency retains all but North American rights to the 
<br>
book.

<p>FRED AND GINGER...SHOES WITH WINGS ON
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/on/fredginger/">http://www.angelfire.com/on/fredginger/</a>
<br>
<p>In 1933 the world of dance changed forever. Near the end
<br>
of the cast billing of a movie called Flying Down To Rio
<br>
were two names that now seem to be incomplete without the
<br>
other. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
<br>
<p>The idea of using compressed air, stored in a light
<br>
container to create a kick board without wheels. The
<br>
bottom is a smooth surface which bends slightly to take
<br>
advantage of a &quot;floor&quot; that the base of the board
<br>
dances on. Speed and direction are controlled by a
<br>
computer which determines which small holes at the bottom
<br>
of the boards base are turned on and which are not. Think
<br>
of a typical air hockey game at an arcade.
<br>
<p>No wasted energy, no special equipment and zero pollution
<br>
fit the descriptions suggested in the article.
<br>
<p>To get a refill (re-fit buildings and cities) you simply
<br>
pop in a reusable cartridge and like a Co2 gun,
<br>
off you go flying on less than an 1/8 off the special
<br>
smooth surface designed assist in control.. like a hot
<br>
wheels track built into the surface areas.
<br>
<p>The larger version would look like a small flying saucer
<br>
turned up side down and again fit into a special surface
<br>
track which is designed for higher speeds and larger
<br>
payloads.
<br>
<p>Think about what Kamen has already worked on in the past
<br>
: The invention itself is as interesting as the inventor.
<br>
Kamen — “a true eccentric, cantankerous and opinionated,
<br>
a great character,” according to the proposal — dropped
<br>
out of college in his 20s, then invented the first drug
<br>
infusion pump; he later created the first portable
<br>
insulin pump and dialysis machine.
<br>
<p>The lack of significant moving parts and the use of
<br>
Earth's gravity to create a slight incline where needed
<br>
and enhance the speed and performance of the shoes with
<br>
wings.
<br>
<p>Think of a University campus wired with compressed air.
<br>
Can we call it the Airnet? You step out of class, step
<br>
onto your Ginger board and hit the compressed air. Off
<br>
you go floating over the track off to the next class. Out
<br>
of gas (air), just plug into a refill station available
<br>
everywhere and you are in business.
<br>
<p>This will work on any size scale as long as the ratio of
<br>
lift to surface area to weight it constant.
<br>
<p>Requires no moving parts to the track or road and can be
<br>
mass manufactured and laid like tile almost anywhere.
