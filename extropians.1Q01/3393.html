<em>&gt;I thought it was funny when the guy threw a cream pie at Bill Gates, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it was a minor crime.  Gates could sue the guy and win for hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousand of dollars, whereas that guy couldn't sue back by himself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gates could probably have the guy dealt with in a more severe manner.
</em><br>

<p><p>There's several interviews with that guy, Noel Godin:
<br>
<a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~jaybab/noel.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~jaybab/noel.html</a>
<br>
People on his list to pie include Bill Graham, some prominent hollywood 
<br>
scientologists, and The Pope.
<br>
There's also an &quot;anarchist pieing group&quot; that throws pies into the faces of 
<br>
people they don't like. They actually have a page where you can vote for 
<br>
people to get pied (Vote Nader!):
<br>
<a href="http://www.entartistes.ca/">http://www.entartistes.ca/</a>
<br>
(to go directly to the voting booth):

<br>
<p>For the record, I don't approve.
