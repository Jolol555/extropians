Dear Mr. Yadav,
<br>
I'm sorry, but your theory, which proposes that thinking is destructive and
<br>
emotion is healing, has prompted me to stop thinking. Now I only feel. And
<br>
my feeling is that your idea for destroying modern industrial civilization
<br>
would doom at least 99% of the people of India to slow death from disease
<br>
and starvation because modern scientific agriculture is the only thing now
<br>
standing between your overpopulated subcontinent and mass death. I feel that
<br>
this would be a bad thing, don't you? Therefore, let's resume thinking.
<br>
<p>Now go to the Extropy Institute webpage (URL given below) and learn how
<br>
advanced technology can save life on earth, end pollution, and make everyone
<br>
healthy, wealthy, and perhaps even wise.
<br>
<p>By the way, I went to your website and read the &quot;Correspondence with
<br>
neuroscientists&quot; as you suggested. They all dismissed your ideas as politely
<br>
as they could. I suggest that you study neuroscience yourself if you feel so
<br>
strongly about your theory. Then you can conduct your own experiments. You
<br>
may be surprised at what you find.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael LaTorra

<p>Subject :  In a fast society slow emotions become extinct.
<br>
FAST VISUALS /WORDS MAKE SLOW EMOTIONS EXTINCT.
<br>
SCIENTIFIC /INDUSTRIAL /FINANCIAL THINKING DESTROYS EMOTIONAL CIRCUITS.
<br>
Dear Sir /Madam,
<br>
THIS IS AN APPEAL FOR HELP.
<br>
I have been trying to prove some co-relations in a laboratory. If the
<br>
members of this association can help in getting the following experiment
<br>
conducted somewhere then please let me know.
<br>
( My background is given in the first letter ( letter No. 1 ) under the
<br>
topic “ Correspondence with neuroscientists “ on the website  :
<br>
www.netshooter.com/emotion )
<br>
<p>IN A FAST SOCIETY SLOW EMOTIONS BECOME EXTINCT.
<br>
A FAST (LARGE) SOCIETY CANNOT FEEL PAIN / REMORSE / EMPATHY.
<br>
A FAST (LARGE) SOCIETY WILL ALWAYS BE CRUEL TO ANIMALS/ TREES/ AIR/
<br>
WATER/ LAND AND TO ITSELF.
<br>
PAIN  / REMORSE  / EMPATHY = SADNESS +  WORRY ( for the suffering of
<br>
others )
<br>
www.netshooter.com/emotion
<br>
<p>Dear Sir / Madam,
<br>
I have proposed the following experiment on emotion and am trying to
<br>
find a neuroscience/psychophysiology/bio-chemistry laboratory where it
<br>
could be conducted.
<br>
Can you provide any kind of help in this search?
<br>
Please share this message with all members of your society(association)
<br>
There is a link between visual / verbal speed ( in perception, memory,
<br>
imagery ) and the bio-chemical state of the brain and the body.
<br>
Emotion can intensify / sustain only when visual and verbal processing
<br>
associated with the emotion slows down ( stops / freezes ).
<br>
The degree of difficulty of an emotion depends upon the degree of
<br>
freezing (of visuals and words ) required to intensify and sustain that
<br>
particular emotion.
<br>
Experiment:
<br>
Subjects (preferably actors specialising in tragedy / tragic roles )
<br>
will be asked to watch a silent video film showing any of the
<br>
following:-
<br>
(1) Human  suffering.
<br>
(2) Animal  suffering.
<br>
(3) Suffering  ( Destruction ) of Air / Water / Land / Trees.
<br>
Subjects will be asked to intensify and sustain the subjective feeling
<br>
of empathy for the sufferer.
<br>
Their brains shall be scanned by Brain Imaging Machines ( PET / FMRI ).
<br>
The chemical change associated with the emotion in the brain ( and the
<br>
rest of the body ) would be measured by appropriate methods.
<br>
The silent video film will be shown at different speeds :
<br>
(1) 125% of actual speed.
<br>
(2) Actual/real speed.
<br>
(3) 75% of actual speed.
<br>
(4) 50% of actual speed.
<br>
(5) 25% of actual speed.
<br>
<p>Results :
<br>
(1) Intensity of emotion increases with the decrease in  visual speed.
<br>
(2) Intensity of emotion is maximum when  visual speed is minimum (25%
<br>
of actual speed)
<br>
(3) The amount of chemical change associated with the emotion in the
<br>
brain ( and rest of the body ) will be found to increase with the
<br>
decrease in visual speed.
<br>
(4) The chemical change is maximum when visual speed is minimum.
<br>
(5) The amount of chemical change will increase with the decrease in
<br>
breathing rate. Breathing becomes so slow and non-rhythmic that it stops
<br>
for some time at the inhalation/ exhalation stages.
<br>
In the 2nd stage of experiment we shall replace the silent video film
<br>
with a Narrator ( Audio only ) and repeat the procedure thereby
<br>
establishing the
<br>
link between intensity of emotion and verbal speed.
<br>
Kindly share this message with people who could help in getting the
<br>
experiment conducted in a Neuroscience / psychophysiology/ bio-chemistry
<br>
laboratory.
<br>
<p>Yours Sincerely,
<br>

<br>
Please note:
<br>
(1) If the co-relation is wrong it will be proved wrong experimentally
<br>
and the matter will end there.
<br>
(2) A THINKING MIND CANNOT INTENSIFY / SUSTAIN ANY EMOTION.
<br>
While this statement is generally true for all emotions, it is
<br>
particularly true for all painful emotions.
<br>
(3) Empathy = Sadness + Worry ( for the suffering of others )
<br>
&nbsp;It will be found that empathy activates the same parts of the brain
<br>
(neural circuits ) which are activated by sadness and worry.  The
<br>
chemical changes in the brain and the rest of the body are also the
<br>
same.
<br>
Sadness and worry ( for the suffering of others ) are emotions of  the
<br>
highest level.
<br>
(4) In a society in which visual ( verbal ) speed and breathing- rates
<br>
are fast pain / remorse / empathy cannot be experienced. It is
<br>
impossible.
<br>
&nbsp;IN A FAST SOCIETY SLOW EMOTIONS BECOME EXTINCT.
<br>
<p>PROOF.
<br>
Proof of the link between pain and slow visuals / words :-
<br>
In the last century man has made thousands of movies / films on various
<br>
themes / subjects. Whenever pain / tragedy is shown in any film the
<br>
visuals ( scenes ) and words ( dialogues ) are always slowed down. In
<br>
many films tragedy is shown in slow motion. At the most intense moment
<br>
of pain the films almost become static / stationary.
<br>
Tragedy-films provide direct proof / evidence of the link between pain
<br>
and slowness.
<br>
Pain can intensify / sustain only when visual ( and verbal ) speed slows
<br>
down( stops/ freezes).
<br>
<p><p>CHANGE IN VISUAL SPEED OVER THE YEARS
<br>
One thousand years ago visuals would change only when man physically
<br>
moved himself to a new place or when other people  ( animals / birds )
<br>
and objects ( clouds / water ) physically moved themselves before him.
<br>
Today man sits in front of TV / Computer and watches the rapidly
<br>
changing visuals / audio.
<br>
He sits in a vehicle ( car / train / bus ) and as it moves he watches
<br>
the rapidly changing visuals.
<br>
He turns the pages of a book / newspaper / magazine and sees many
<br>
visuals / text in a short span.
<br>
The speed of visuals ( and words ) has increased so much during the last
<br>
one hundred years that today the human brain has become incapable of
<br>
focussing on slow visuals /words through perception, memory, imagery.
<br>
If we cannot focus on slow visuals / words we cannot experience emotions
<br>
associated with slow visuals /words.
<br>
IN A FAST SOCIETY SLOW EMOTIONS BECOME EXTINCT.
<br>
<p><p>Before the advent of Industrial Revolution Man’s thinking was primarily
<br>
limited to :
<br>
(a) visual processing ( slow visuals )
<br>
(b) verbal / language processing ( slow words )
<br>
Today there are many kinds of fast thinking :
<br>
(1) visual processing ( fast visuals )
<br>
(2) verbal / language processing ( fast words )
<br>
If visual / verbal processing is fast we cannot feel slow emotions.
<br>
(3) Scientific / Technical thinking ( fast )
<br>
(4) Industrial thinking ( fast )
<br>
(5) Business thinking ( fast )
<br>
(3), (4) &amp; (5) ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NUMBERS / SYMBOLS / EQUATIONS /
<br>
GRAPHS /CIRCUITS / DIAGRAMS / MONEY / ACCOUNTING etc…
<br>
As long as the mind is doing  this kind of thinking  it cannot feel any
<br>
emotion – not an iota of emotion.
<br>
In a fast society slow emotions become extinct.
<br>
In a thinking ( scientific / industrial ) society emotion itself becomes
<br>
extinct.
<br>
EMOTION IS WHAT REMAINS IN THE MIND WHEN VISUAL /VERBAL PROCESSING SLOWS
<br>
DOWN (STOPS/ FREEZES )
<br>
<p>A society that speeds up mentally experiences every mental slowing-down
<br>
as Depression / Anxiety.
<br>
A ( travelling )society that speeds up physically experiences every
<br>
physical slowing-down as Depression / Anxiety.
<br>
A society that entertains itself daily experiences every
<br>
non-entertaining moment as Depression  / Anxiety.
<br>
<p><p>SELF-ASSESSMENT OF ( SUBJECTIVE ) INTENSITY OF EMOTION IS ALMOST ALWAYS
<br>
WRONG.
<br>
Suppose the highest ( maximum ) intensity of a particular emotion that
<br>
can be experienced by any human being is 100 units.
<br>
Let us suppose the  maximum intensity of that particular emotion ever
<br>
experienced by two people  A &amp; B in their entire life is :
<br>
A – 100units
<br>
B  -  20 units
<br>
Now suppose  A &amp; B are made subjects on a particular day and are asked
<br>
to feel that particular emotion under experimental conditions ( or
<br>
outside the laboratory ) and the intensity they actually experience is
<br>
:
<br>
A – 90 units
<br>
B -  18 units
<br>
If A &amp;B are then asked to indicate the intensity of emotion on a scale
<br>
of  0 –10 their response is likely to be ;
<br>
A – 9
<br>
B -  9
<br>
Who is right and who is wrong ?
<br>
A is right.
<br>
B is wrong – B is wrong by a wide margin – B has experienced an
<br>
intensity of 18 units out of a maximum of 100 units and his correct /
<br>
actual score should be 1.8 )
<br>
Self- assessment  ( self rating ) can be accurate only if people have
<br>
the capacity to experience the highest intensity  ( units ) of the
<br>
particular emotion under study.
<br>
<p><p>In small ( slow ) agriculture based societies of the past because of
<br>
physical work and slow visual/verbal processing the mind used to
<br>
experience a state of emotion all the time.
<br>
Emotion can intensify / sustain only when visual / verbal processing
<br>
slows down ( stops / freezes ). In an Industrial (thinking) society
<br>
because of fast ( visual / verbal / scientific / industrial / business )
<br>
thinking people experience very little emotion.
<br>
Suppose the maximum intensity of a particular emotion ( for most people
<br>
) in a fast society has reduced to 5 units ( from 100 units that people
<br>
used to experience in earlier /slower societies ).
<br>
If such people experience 4 units of emotion they will give themselves a
<br>
rating /score of  8 on a scale of 0-10 whereas their actual score should
<br>
be 0.4
<br>
IN A FAST SOCIETY SLOW EMOTIONS BECOME EXTINCT.
<br>
<p><p>(1) A thinking species destroys the planet.
<br>
(2) Animals lived on earth for billions of years (in very large numbers)
<br>
without destroying nature.
<br>
(3) They did not destroy nature because their thinking / activity was
<br>
limited to searching for food for one time only.
<br>
(4) Man has existed on earth in large numbers for only a few thousand
<br>
years / a few hundred years.
<br>
(5) Within this short period Man has destroyed the environment.
<br>
(6) This destruction took place because of Man’s thinking.
<br>
(7)  When  man thinks he makes things.
<br>
(8) When he makes things he kills animals / trees / air / water / land.
<br>
( Nothing can be made without killing these five elements of nature ).
<br>
(9) A thinking species destroys the planet.
<br>
<p>There was a time when Man knew nothing about the number of species and
<br>
millions of species existed.
<br>
Today Man knows the names of millions of species and nothing is left of
<br>
the species.
<br>
<p><p>Man can do the same physical work every day.
<br>
Man cannot do the same mental work every day.
<br>
When man used to do physical work ( farming and related activities ) he
<br>
could do the same repetitive work  day after day- generation after
<br>
generation.
<br>
After the Industrial Revolution when man switched-over to mental work he
<br>
began a never ending process of making new machines / things / products-
<br>
a process which can only end with the complete destruction of
<br>
environment ( planet ).
<br>
AS LONG AS CITIES EXIST ENVIRONMENT CANNOT BE SAVED.
<br>
To save the ( remaining ) environment  from destruction man will have to
<br>
return back to physical work ( smaller communities ).
<br>
To save the mind from mental diseases man will have to return back to
<br>
physical work ( smaller communities ).
<br>
<p><p>Environment can be saved only if we stop production of most ( more than
<br>
99% ) of the consumer goods we are making today.
<br>
ENVIRONMENT CANNOT BE SAVED BY RECYCLING
<br>
TRYING TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT BY RECYCLING IS LIKE SHOOTING SOMEONE
<br>
10,000  TIMES AND THEN TRYING TO SAVE HIM BY TAKING OUT ONE BULLET.
<br>
