<p>This was really interesting, Chris. Thanks for posting it.  The way I 
<br>
happened to get to know several Indians fairly well was through having an 
<br>
Indian nanny to look after my daughter while I was at work. R was a medical 
<br>
doctor in India but couldn't practice in the US until she passed the board 
<br>
exams. She was hooked in with a whole community of Indians, most of whom 
<br>
were students or spouses of students at the university. R's husband was 
<br>
studying there--he had been from one of the lower classes and she was from 
<br>
one of the upper classes and violated social rules by marrying him. The 
<br>
people I got to know well were all women from various socio-economic 
<br>
classes. Maybe the tales I heard of India would have been different if I'd 
<br>
known men rather than women. The women always seemed to be busy doing 
<br>
something--cooking or making clothes or crafts. But, like women I've known 
<br>
in Mexican villages, they'd make their work fun by doing it together and 
<br>
talking or singing while they worked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They couldn't have cared less.  For the most part, they came in, worked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their hours, then went home.
</em><br>
<p>The Indian computer programmers I've met via the Internet seem to enjoy 
<br>
their work and be dedicated to it. But of course I have no way of knowing 
<br>
what sort of hours they work. Maybe they lead more balanced lives than 
<br>
typical Americans by working their hours and going home. Family life seemed 
<br>
to be important to the Indian people I knew.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The only time we noticed any kind of dedication to work was with the women.
</em><br>
<p>This seems consistent with what I've read in the anthropology literature. 
<br>
If you look at all known human societies, it appears that women are most 
<br>
often responsible for basic food, cooking utensils, shelter, and clothing, 
<br>
while men are more likely to engage in hunting and  warfare which involve 
<br>
short periods of intense effort divided by longer periods of relative 
<br>
inactivity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The response was, &quot;Well, laying the bricks is 'skilled' labor.&quot;  It's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really hard to keep a straight face in that country.  The real reason was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they have a comfortable little male-dominated society, and they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weren't interested in rocking their lazy-ass boat.
</em><br>
<p>I think things are changing as more women go to school, especially 
<br>
universities. One educated woman can have a lot of influence among other 
<br>
women.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I could spend days detailing my experiences there and those of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;coworkers, but suffice it to say that India's problems aren't some big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;magical mystery.  They're not just the fault of their government or their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large population or the evil Western World.  It's a failure of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals of their society who embrace a culture of ignorance, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corruption, and getting the &quot;other guy&quot; to do their work for them.
</em><br>
<p>Based on what you saw of life in India, Chris, what effect do you think a 
<br>
guraranteed income would have on individuals (assuming that such a thing 
<br>
were possible at no cost to anyone else, such as with nanotechnology)?
