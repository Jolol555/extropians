<em>&gt; &gt; Though the blurb at this page (and to some degree, Sowell himself)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; frames it as conservative vs. liberal, it's really more about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; zetetic-pragmatist vs. idealist (yes, Virginia, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Objectivist/conservative/materialist idealists).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To clarify, since it seems I sometimes go too fast for some people:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;it's really more about...&quot; refers to the conflict of visions itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the book. And government involvement is a side effect, not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrinsic, of said conflict.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the subtitle of the book is &quot;Ideological Origins of Political
<br>
Struggles.&quot;  This kind of gives the idea that it's about ideologies and not
<br>
purely governmental stuff.:)
<br>
<p>Also, the problem I found with the book, for all its keen insights, were
<br>
similar to those I found to Hayek's _The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of
<br>
Socialism_.  Both books assume morality is supposed to be antithetical to
<br>
the market and a clean separation between morality and prudence.  Actually,
<br>
the latter is, for both thinkers, IMHO, responsible for the former.  This is
<br>
because they assume that morality means conventional morality -- i.e.,
<br>
roughly the Judeochristian morality of Western societies.
<br>
<p>Adopting a morality that is more this-worldly, such as that of
<br>
neoAristoteleans (e.g., Douglas Den Uyl, Eric Mack), neoStoics (e.g.,
<br>
Lawrence Becker), and Objectivists (you know who:) would lead to no conflict
<br>
between morality and prudence -- or between being moral and living in real
<br>
world societies.  Integrating such moralities with a wider social vision --
<br>
as all the aforementioned thinkers attempt -- seems to lead to similar
<br>
conclusions about social engineering but fall just short of the kind of
<br>
total conservatism some of Sowell's and Hayek's thought seems to lead to.
<br>
(I mean the kind of line that if it's a designed institution it must be
<br>
socialist.  It would seem to me that all social institutions are a
<br>
combination of both design and unintended consequences.)
<br>
<p>Nonethless, Sowell's book is worth the read.  (I'm not sure about the
<br>
listen, since that depends on the speaker.:)  So is Hayek's.  I also
<br>
recommend Sowell's _Preferential Policies: An International Perspective_.
<br>
That book covers government mandated favoritism programs around the world.
<br>
It is especially recommended to those who tend to view all policy matters
<br>
merely in terms of their society and its history.
<br>
<p>Side note:  the Summer 1995 issue of _In Principle_ contained a review of
<br>
the book by Robert Knapp.  Sadly, I don't have Knapp's permission to place
<br>
this review online...  See <a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/InPrin.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/InPrin.html</a> for
<br>
the tables of contents of that and other issues of _IP_.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
