<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:
<br>
Longterm arthritis benefits proven for glucosamine
<br>
<p>The prestigious medical journal The Lancet published an article in their
<br>
January 27, 2001 issue confirming the benefit of glucosamine sulfate
<br>
supplements in the longterm treatment of arthritis.  Medical treatment of
<br>
arthritis has consisted of symptom relief with the use of drugs that
<br>
produce side effects or even worsen the condition if taken over a long
<br>
period of time.  While medicine has sought compounds that could halt or
<br>
reverse the progression of joint damage that occurs with arthritis,
<br>
nutritionists and alternative physicians have been recommending
<br>
supplements containing glucosamine for their arthritis patients with
<br>
excellent results.  Glucosamine is a constituent of the glycosaminoglycans
<br>
in cartilage matrix and synovial fluid of the joints
<br>
<p>Two hundred twelve patients with mild to moderate arthritis were randomly
<br>
assigned a 1500 mg daily glucosamine sulfate supplement or a placebo for a
<br>
period of  three years in a double-blind trial.  X-ray films of the knee
<br>
were taken at the beginning and the conclusion of the study to measure
<br>
joint space width, in order to assess cartilage loss.  The study
<br>
participants completed questionnaires in which symptoms such as pain,
<br>
joint function and stiffness were scored.
<br>
<p>At the conclusion of the study, participants who received the placebo had
<br>
significant mean and minimum joint-space narrowing, showing cartilage
<br>
loss.  The majority of the  group of 106 patients receiving glucosamine
<br>
sulfate had no significant joint-space narrowing.  Evaluation of the
<br>
questionnaires showed an improvement of symptoms in the glucosamine group
<br>
and a worsening of symptoms in the placebo group.  Even in the small group
<br>
of patients who received glucosamine and experienced joint-space
<br>
narrowing, symptomatic relief was noted.
<br>
<p>One of the concerns recently voiced in regard to glucosamine is its
<br>
possible adverse effect on blood sugar levels.  However, no effect but a
<br>
slight decrease in fasting glucose levels was observed in the group
<br>
receiving glucosamine sulfate.  No other metabolic changes were noted.
<br>
<p>The authors conclude that glucosamine's combined structure-modifying and
<br>
symptom-modifying benefits in arthritis could modify the progression of
<br>
the disease and they suggest further studies.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Arthritis
<br>
<p>To understand the pathological processes in the joint, we need to take a
<br>
look at the normal healthy joint. Joints are held together by a joint
<br>
capsule and designed to allow smooth movement between adjacent bones. In
<br>
the type of joint commonly affected by arthritic diseases, the highly
<br>
movable joints, we find the bone ends covered by articular cartilage and
<br>
the joint space enclosed by a synovial membrane. This thin membrane
<br>
secretes synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the
<br>
cartilage-covered joint-forming bones. The cartilage contains no blood
<br>
vessels or nerves and receives its nutrients by diffusion from the
<br>
synovial fluid and from the bone.
<br>
<p>Joint function depends on the health of the cartilage in the joint.
<br>
Cartilage is a gel-like substance that acts as a shock absorber, essential
<br>
for smooth and easy movement in the joint. Cartilage gets its elasticity
<br>
from collagen fibers and its sponge-like quality from water, held by a
<br>
structure of big molecules called proteoglycans. Collagen and
<br>
proteoglycans are produced by special cells, called chondrocytes, in the
<br>
cartilage. Joints can withstand enormous pressure by slowly releasing
<br>
water from the cartilage.
<br>
As we age, the ability to restore and maintain a normal cartilage
<br>
structure seems to decrease. The activity of important repair enzymes is
<br>
reduced, the water content diminished, and the joints become more prone to
<br>
damage. But the full pathological mechanism for arthritis development is
<br>
not yet known.
<br>
<p>Osteoarthritis/arthrosis is a disease mainly characterized by degenerative
<br>
processes of the articular cartilage, but changes also involve the
<br>
synovial membrane and the bone next to the cartilage. It is a gradual
<br>
decay that most often affects the weight- bearing joints (knees, hips, and
<br>
spinal joints) and the joints of the hand. A breakdown of the cartilage
<br>
matrix leads to cracks and ulcers and a thinning of the cartilage with a
<br>
loss of shock absorption. The underlying bone starts to thicken as a
<br>
response to the increasing stress, and bone spurs are formed. In the
<br>
advanced phases of osteoarthritis, an inflammatory reaction in the
<br>
synovial membrane can be seen. This severe degeneration causes pain,
<br>
swelling, deformation, and reduced range of motion.
<br>
<p>New factors have been identified in the pathology of both common forms of
<br>
arthritis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This research has
<br>
enabled scientists to develop novel natural therapies that work along
<br>
multiple pathways not taken into account by FDA-approved drugs. These
<br>
botanical extracts and natural agents have an extraordinary safety profile
<br>
and a long track record of clinical success in Europe.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The most popular prescription drug in the United States works by
<br>
suppressing the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).
<br>
Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase cause the formation of prostaglandin E2
<br>
and leukotriene B4, two proinflammatory agents that stimulate other
<br>
enzymes to degrade cartilage in the joint. Nettle leaf extract contains a
<br>
variety of natural cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors. While COX-2
<br>
inhibition can be obtained from either nettle leaf extract or FDA-approved
<br>
drugs, only nettle has been shown to also interfere with the TNF-a and
<br>
IL-1B activation of cartilage destroying enzymes. Nettle leaf has a long
<br>
tradition of use as a safe adjuvant remedy in the treatment of arthritis
<br>
in Germany.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>ArthroPro System
<br>
<p>Unlike toxic FDA approved drugs, natural therapies provide safe relief
<br>
from chronic inflammation and pain. While FDA approved drugs can cause
<br>
cartilage destruction, natural therapies help promote regeneration of the
<br>
cartilage matrix. The Life Extension Foundation has taken the natural
<br>
ingredients that are used to treat arthritis in Europe and combined them
<br>
into one formulation called ArthroPro. ArthroPro provides pharmaceutical
<br>
extracts from the nettle leaf, ginger root and willow bark. To avoid
<br>
stomach discomfort sometimes associated with fish oil, ArthroPro provides
<br>
enterically coated fish-ginger oil softgels that dissolve in the small
<br>
intestine. ArthroPro uses only European origin glucosamine and chondroitin
<br>
sulfates, along with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
<br>
<p>The natural ingredients in ArthroPro protect the joint cartilage, while
<br>
reducing chronic inflammation and pain by:
<br>
<p>Inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
<br>
Suppressing tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta
<br>
Inhibiting the formation of prostaglandin E2
<br>
Promoting the synthesis of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans in the
<br>
joint
<br>
Suppressing cartilage destroying enzymes collagenase and phopholipase
<br>
Attracting water to the cartilage to enhance synovial lubrication

<p><p>Glucosamine sulfate 750 mg tablets
<br>
<p>Glucosamine is a naturally occurring amino sugar synthesized in the body
<br>
from L-glutamine and glucose.  As a supplement, it comes in several
<br>
different forms of which the sulfated, hydrochloric acid, and N-acetylated
<br>
are commonly available. Amino sugars are the key components of larger
<br>
compounds called glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins which allow cells in
<br>
tissues to hold together. They are necessary for the construction and
<br>
maintenance of virtually all connective tissues and lubricating fluids in
<br>
the body -tendons, ligaments, cartilage, bone matrix, skin, joint fluid,
<br>
intestinal lining, and mucous membranes. In particular, N-acetyl
<br>
glucosamine is the final form which together with glucuronic acid is
<br>
polymerized to make the joint lubricant hyaluronic acid.

<br>
Arthritis Update:  Drugs that inhibit COX-2 may cause tissue damage by
<br>
William Faloon
<br>
<p>The scales tilt on the side of nature
<br>
<p>Drugs that inhibit the cyclooxyenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme have shown efficacy
<br>
in alleviating inflammation and pain caused by arthritis. Celebrex and
<br>
Vioxx are two popular COX-2 inhibitors that are being aggressively
<br>
marketed to arthritis patients by drug companies.  A new study published
<br>
in the Journal of Immunology acknowledges the temporary benefits of COX-2
<br>
inhibitors, but identifies a potential long-term problem that could lead
<br>
to cartilage and other tissue degeneration if these drugs are taken over
<br>
an extended time period.
<br>
<p>The authors of this study found that COX-2 inhibitors cause metabolic
<br>
imbalances that can result in the over production of two toxic cytokines,
<br>
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin one beta (IL1B). Both
<br>
TNF-a and IL-1B have been shown to play a role in the cartilage
<br>
destruction and the inflammation process.  TNF-a and IL-1B have been found
<br>
to be elevated in the synovial fluid and the cartilage of osteoarthritis
<br>
patients. Thus, the short term beneficial effects of these agents on
<br>
arthritic pain and inflammation may be achieved at the cost of an
<br>
increased propensity to long term tissue damage caused by TNF-a and IL1B.
<br>
<p>Too much TNF-a results in a host of aging-related disorders including
<br>
autoimmune disease, congestive heart failure, insulin resistance and
<br>
catabolic wasting.  When TNF-a attacks the linings of the joints, the
<br>
result is inflammation, pain and eventual immobility.
