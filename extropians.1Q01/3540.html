<p>Funny, but since I've never seen a post from you here that I recall, I

suppose I was assuming you might possibly be a lurker who is a green
<br>
keeping an eye on us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course I don't dispute this in general terms. I was responding (somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flippantly, I will admit) to what I perceived to be a tired and over-used blanket
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application of the term, as if it means only one universally agreed upon thing rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a continuum of things. I see it used this way all the time by people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply trying to rationalize or excuse specific behaviors, and by defeatists who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given up on the idea that we can change and/or improve ourselves. If you meant it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more specific way, an elaboration would have been useful. If I read more into it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than was there, I certainly apologize for misinterpreting you.
</em><br>
<p>THanks. Sorry if I was not detailed enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; Communism is only non-despotic in its perfect state. Perfection is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unstable state, which is a truism of all natural systems. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impossible to attain equilibria in a perfect state due to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instability, thus communism will always be despotic, and given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nature of power to corrupt and attract the corruptible, communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; societies will always result in tyranny. Ant colonies may be cute, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are heinously despotic and irrespective of the individual. Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because communist despotism (i.e. imperfect) works for ants doesn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it works for humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no argument with this either, again in general terms. Did I sound like I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defending communism? Ouch. My personal political philosophy is nowhere near it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe me. I was simply trying to make a point, which I obviously failed to do. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was irritated by what I again saw as a tired tactic, that of labeling other people as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communists simply to somehow demonize them or put them down. I think this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter-productive strategy and can weaken one's credibility.
</em><br>
<p>No, reading from my entire post, you see that I've been spending a large
<br>
amount of time talking with such people, so my statements are not
<br>
stereotypes, prejudices, or any other sort of unsupported statements,
<br>
they are reflecting statements made to me by many such individuals who
<br>
are highly active in the green/anarchism movement, people who are
<br>
organizers of things like the Seattle, DC, and other protests. They are
<br>
invariably anti-capital, and blame all of society's ills on
<br>
corporations. They refuse to see government as the problem, using the
<br>
same sort of excuses they use to apologize for the USSR: government is
<br>
just a tool that has been corrupted by corporations because it was
<br>
structured to protect the rich, etc. etc etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Libertarianism has no perfect state, that is its nature. It is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attaining an equilibrium between individuals that is flexible based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the abilities, wants, and needs of each individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm. We'll have to part ways on this one. While I would personally prefer a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian system over a communist one, I think it too can be used by corrupt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals to oppress or exploit others (which is what has always, historically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been the case with communism). Not to pose a conundrum, but isn't the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism has no perfect state itself a perfect state? I have always felt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the libertarian ideal is just that, an ideal, although one that certainly allows more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerance of others than most. Perhaps I just think about things differently.
</em><br>
<p>It is only an ideal in that despots and demagogues have warped the
<br>
political landscape so much that we think the current state is 'the
<br>
norm', that the middle of the current political landscape is 'centrist'.
<br>
Its not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You don't get a stable functioning society by making everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; give up their entire days work to the collective, because it IS human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nature for an individual to believe they produced more than they did and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deserve more than they do, and to expect additional reward for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; additional or better work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again I feel like you are using the term &quot;human nature&quot; as if it means only one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing. Have you personally interviewed everyone on the planet to see if they agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with you? Of course not. People who are raised in a capitalist or market driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society are going to feel this way (I certainly do), but that does not mean it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only way to look at things. It is ultimately a personal or cultural preference, not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given, no matter how much we detest it.
</em><br>
<p>If your statement is true, then why do the people in every other culture
<br>
invariably want the sort of society we have? They want 4 door cars, PCs,
<br>
internet access, good neighborhoods and schools, honest elections, and
<br>
all of the other features of the America that isn't marred by big city
<br>
welfare state problems.
<br>
<p>Now, I do make exceptions. The French, for example. ;) They are the
<br>
exception that proves the rule...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is human nature for a person to put more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; importance in the safety, security, freedom and happiness of themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and loved ones versus anybody else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with you on this one because it can be traced to our biology. This applies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most animals in varying degrees.
</em><br>
<p>Then you should accept the previous one as well. Animals always want to
<br>
get the greatest benefit for the least investment possible, and will
<br>
engage in pecking order behaviors.
