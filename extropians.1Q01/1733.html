<p>I have to say I don't really understand this paranoia of yours.
<br>
<p>In normal countries like where I live ;-), nobody has a gun. Only licensed
<br>
hunters, police officers and army officers are allowed to have weapons. If
<br>
anyone else wants to have a weapon, it's a tough procedure to get it - among
<br>
other things, you have to get a license and register with the government,
<br>
and you can be quite sure you won't get a license if you have any kind of
<br>
criminal record. Without a license, no purchase possible.
<br>
<p>Sure, there are gangs and lunatics, and they have illegal guns. But they
<br>
don't shoot people all over the place - in fact, gangs very rarely shoot
<br>
anyone outside of their circles at all [for kidnapping victims, they seem to
<br>
prefer drowning], while lunatics typically shoot people they are angry with,
<br>
they get caught easily, and then they get something like a 10 year prison
<br>
sentence.
<br>
<p>Sure, the police can &quot;raid your house with a swat team, shoot first and ask
<br>
questions later&quot;. But it doesn't happen; we simply don't have a national
<br>
culture of shooting each other. The police very rarely use their weapons,
<br>
even in extreme cases, and each bullet is accounted for. And that's even
<br>
with our police being somewhat corrupt - there are reports that some of them
<br>
take bribes to allow some people to do things they shouldn't, but I haven't
<br>
heard of a police officer to shoot a person that is anything less than an
<br>
arrogant, widely known and notorious criminal.
<br>
<p>So, I don't think America's aversion against banning guns has any rational
<br>
structure at all. There is no need to buy them back. There is no need to be
<br>
easy on guns. You just ban them, instate a heavy fine on owning illegal
<br>
weapons, and that's it. Give everyone a year or two to get used to the fact,
<br>
and the problem is solved.
<br>
<p>In particular, your argument about someone protecting themselves with a gun
<br>
while the police &quot;raid his house with a swat team&quot; is, well, far off. I
<br>
think your swat teams are expert enough that no one will survive shooting
<br>
back against them. If they want to shoot you, they can do it anyway -
<br>
pretending a gun provides any real protection against the police is an
<br>
illusion. The only thing you might be able to do with it is kill a few good
<br>
police officers before they put a bullet in your head for doing so.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
