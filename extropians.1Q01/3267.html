Follow-up to Spike's comment:
<br>
<em>&gt; So how do we prevent it from invading homes?  Not by police but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by nosy or horny neighbors for instance, in the form of microcams
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried by insects or mice.
</em><br>
<p>For the current (unclassified) state of the art in this area, an article
<br>
pointed to by Slashdot describes a self-contained robot about 5/8 inches
<br>
on a side: <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001/minirobot.htm">http://www.sandia.gov/media/NewsRel/NR2001/minirobot.htm</a>
<br>
(access may be slow today).  Contrary to the Slashdot summary, it does
<br>
not presently have a camera, but they hope to add one soon.

<br>
<p>===
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 1/4 cubic inch and weighing less than an ounce, it is possibly the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smallest autonomous untethered robot ever created. Powered by three
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watch batteries, it rides on track wheels and consists of an 8K ROM
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processor, temperature sensor, and two motors that drive the wheels.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancements being considered include a miniature camera, microphone,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communication device, and chemical micro-sensor.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Previous small robots consisted of packaged electronic parts that were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more bulky and took up valuable space. By eliminating the packaging
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and using electronic components in die form, we reduced the size of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the robots electronics considerably,&quot; Heller says. &quot;This was a first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;major step.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unpackaged parts are assembled onto a simple multi-chip module
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a glass substrate. The assembly was done at Sandia's Compound
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semiconductor Research Laboratory.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doug Adkins, who developed the mechanical design for the new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mini-robot, says the researchers further reduced its size by using
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a new rapid prototyping technique to form the device's body. Called
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stereolithography, the material-building method lays down a very thin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;polymer deposit that is cured by a laser.  The material, which &quot;grows&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as each layer is added, is lightweight, strong, and can be formed in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complex shapes. The robot bodies have cavities for the batteries, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electronics-embedded glass substrate, axles, tiny motors, switches,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and other parts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate size of the miniature robots is primarily limited by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the size of the power source - the three watch batteries.  The body
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be large enough to hold batteries to support power requirements
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the robot.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Batteries - both the physical size and battery life - have been one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of our biggest issues,&quot; Heller says. &quot;The batteries need to run longer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be smaller.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few years, with additional help from other Sandia groups,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heller and Adkins expect to add to the mini-robots either infrared or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radio wireless two-way communication capability, as well as miniature
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video cameras, microphones, and chemical micro-sensors.
