<p>A Fundamentalist Christian says that the Bible is literally true, 
<br>
logically sound, and perfect in every way.  I say, &quot;The Bible says 
<br>
that rabbits chew their cud, but we know for a fact that they don't.&quot;
<br>
<p>After years of discussing this issue and hundreds more like it, I can 
<br>
tell you what the typical Fundamentalist response will be: an ad 
<br>
hominem, a red herring, or most likely just silence.
<br>
<p>Although I agree with you that many points of view are dismissed as 
<br>
irrational out of hand, even though there may be a hidden logical 
<br>
framework; I also very often encounter the above type of logical 
<br>
disconnect.
<br>
<p>The problem is that many of these groups don't consider logic to be 
<br>
as important as &quot;we&quot; do.  Logic is only a convenient tool, to be used 
<br>
when possible, but to be discarded when that logic might upset one of 
<br>
their core beliefs.
<br>
<p>I've had countless Fundamentalist Christians tell me, &quot;logic can't 
<br>
give you the answers of the spirit,&quot; or &quot;logic can't always be 
<br>
applied to God's message to us.&quot;  Pffpthfffpthfffft!  Then stop 
<br>
saying that the Bible is logical, dammit!
<br>
<p>To a Fundamentalist Christian, the most important thing in the world 
<br>
is God in his life and his eternal salvation.  When confronted face 
<br>
to face with logical inconsistencies in his own philosophies, he will 
<br>
just skip over those inconsistences and not even deal with them, or 
<br>
sometimes he'll lash out at those presenting those inconsistencies. 
<br>
His brain deals with the cognitive dissonance in textbook fashion, 
<br>
and the thing that he's least likely to do is to revise his framework 
<br>
to make it more logical.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When someone dismisses an opponent as being irrational, what they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really mean is that they don't understand and are not interested in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;investigating.
</em><br>
<p>Aren't you over-generalizing here?  Do you really mean to say that 
<br>
all belief systems are rational, and that those who find 
<br>
irrationality are just fooling themselves?
<br>
<p>J.R., time to add &quot;logic&quot; to your list of useless hypotheses.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
