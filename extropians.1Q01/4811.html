<em>&gt; Rebels Against the Future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's new, they hate it...
</em><br>
<p>I know we should be disgusted and frightened by this movement, but oddly
<br>
I had a different reaction while reading the article.
<br>
<p>After all these years that we have been talking about these ideas to a
<br>
disbelieving world, here is a group that really gets it, that actually
<br>
believes us.  They believe in biotech, in nanotech, in computers and AI
<br>
and human-machine melding.  The believe that it can utterly reshape
<br>
the world.
<br>
<p>The only problem is, they hate the idea.
<br>
<p>But still, to have a group believe, even though they are opposed,
<br>
is worth something.  At least its a reaction.  Opposition is better
<br>
than apathy.  I found it refreshing and gratifying to hear about these
<br>
people who believe in the promise of new technology, who are beginning
<br>
to understand that the future won't just be a matter of the same sort
<br>
of gradual changes that we have had in the past.
<br>
<p>And really, if they want to oppose it, that's their right.  These are
<br>
huge changes; few of us expect the human race to leave this century in
<br>
anything like its historical form (and some put the time frame in a decade
<br>
or two).  This is not a transformation which people can take in stride.
<br>
At best it is going to be a tumultuous ride, at worst outright war
<br>
and possibly total annihilation.  It is better for all concerned for
<br>
people to put their cards on the table as early as possible, to begin
<br>
considering these changes far in advance.  That's where the Foresight
<br>
Institute got its name, after all.
<br>
<p>In the end, I am skeptical that these anti-technology movements can
<br>
succeed in their broadest goals, simply because they must adopt technology
<br>
in order to stay current and competitive.  Did those 1500 participants
<br>
get notified about the gathering by carrier pigeon and smoke signals?
<br>
Undoubtedly the organizers used cell phones, fax machines and computers
<br>
to spread the word.  &quot;Computers are a colonizing technology,&quot; one of
<br>
the speakers lamented, recognizing this fundamental inconsistency in
<br>
their world-view.  They can't oppose technology who rely on it.
<br>
<p>In the end they will be forced to adopt a more nuanced position,
<br>
accepting some technologies while questioning others.  This will lead
<br>
to less stridency and hopefully allow for a more open dialog.
<br>
<p>We need to have a discussion, a global conversation about where we
<br>
are going and what we will do when we get there.  Turning Joe Sixpack
<br>
soccer hooligans into immortal beings of pure energy isn't going to
<br>
happen overnight.  The sooner we get started talking together, the better.
<br>
