<p><em>&gt; In the &quot;general case&quot;, the landscape is not subject to optimization. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence is an evolutionary advantage because it enables the organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to model, predict, and manipulate regularities in reality.  In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximum-entropy Universe, which is what you're talking about, intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is impossible and so is evolution.  The fitness landscape you're talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about, and that the paper you cited is talking about, bears no useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resemblance to our own low-entropy reality.
</em><br>
<p>True. My point is that if you want to build something that functions
<br>
in the real low-entropy world, then you have a good chance. But if it
<br>
is only going on inside the high-entropy world of algorithms then you
<br>
will likely not get any good results. This is why I consider
<br>
&quot;transcendence in a box&quot; scenarios so misleading. Having stuff
<br>
transcend in the real world is another matter - but here we also get
<br>
more slow interactions as a limiting factor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You completely left recursive self-enhancement out of your description of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the process.  You described a constant (and pretty darn blind-looking)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function trying to improve a piece of code, rather than a piece of code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving itself, or a general intelligence improving vis component
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subprocesses.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, my description may not have been clear enough then. What I was
<br>
looking at was a sequence where program P_n searches for a replacement
<br>
program P_{n+1}. It is recursive, although being a theoretician I
<br>
tried to frame it in such a way that it could also include both the
<br>
single program looking for optimization or the development of whole
<br>
software ecologies within the sumbol 'P'. I guess I should have
<br>
formulated myself more clearly. The danger of just writing a post and
<br>
not reading it through carefully. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, if the improvement curve is so horribly logarithmic, then why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't the vast majority of BLIND evolution on this planet take place in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first million years?  If increasing complexity or increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement renders further improvements more difficult to find, then why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't BLIND evolution show a logarithmic curve?  These mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories bear no resemblance to *any* observable reality.
</em><br>
<p>You see it very much in alife simulations. This is why so many people
<br>
try to find ways of promoting continual evolution in them; the holy
<br>
grail would be to get some kind of cambrian explosion of
<br>
complexity. 
<br>
<p>(In RL I think that explosion was likely due to the appearance of
<br>
flexible homeobox body plans and co-evolutionary arms races between
<br>
shelled predators and prey, the first a case of discovering a regular
<br>
and easily evolvable subspace that the second made it profitable to
<br>
exploit.)
<br>
<p>And I think there was actually this fast learning once replicators
<br>
appeared on Earth. It just didn't leave any traces we can find. Over
<br>
the next eons a lot of stuff happened, but rather slowly. All the
<br>
&quot;quick&quot; evolution the see in the modern multicellular world (Oh, I
<br>
feel a case of &quot;In my day, we didn't have fancy metazoan body plans,
<br>
we had to make do on our own in the primordial soup!&quot; coming up :-) is
<br>
actually an evolution of high-level body plans rather than the basic
<br>
metabolic stuff that took eons to learn. And even this body plan
<br>
development slowed down quickly after Cambrium, leaving the room open
<br>
for further bursts as further high-level systems were added.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If BLIND evolution is historically observed to move at a linear or better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate, then self-improvement should proceed at an exponential or better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate.  Differential equations don't get any simpler than that.
</em><br>
<p>The question is how you measure evolutionary improvement. In alife you
<br>
can just measure fitness. In real life the best thing is to look at
<br>
the rate of extinction, which could be seen as a measure of the
<br>
average fitness of entire species. In
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/adap-org/9811003">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/adap-org/9811003</a> it is mentioned that we see a
<br>
general decrease in extinction rate in the phanerozoic; it seems to be
<br>
a 1/t decline according to them. 
<br>
<p>Then we get the problem of how much better deliberate design is over
<br>
blind evolution. This depends a lot on the fitness landscape and
<br>
whether there exists detectable regularities. Intelligent systems are
<br>
able to not just optimize something, but to use information from an
<br>
environment to find an effective way of doing it. In the general case
<br>
intelligence is of course no use, but as you point out, this is
<br>
fortunately a low entropy world where intelligence has some
<br>
applications :-) 
<br>
<p>A certain intelligent system will still be better at some forms of
<br>
environments than others - a good intelligence will work well in
<br>
likely environments. The problem here is the amount of information
<br>
needed to understand the environment well enough to be smart; it has
<br>
taken humanity 500 years of the scientific method to get this far, and
<br>
we still have fairly little experience of AI programming to tell what
<br>
kind of environment that is. 
<br>
<p>So I guess we cannot at present clearly say how much better deliberate
<br>
design is in brain building. But it seems to be a doable question with
<br>
some research, even today.
