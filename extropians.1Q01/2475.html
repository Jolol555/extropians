<p>Be careful how you explain this.  Evolution has two stages:  Random 
<br>
mutation and natural selection.  The random mutation still occurs in 
<br>
humans as much as it ever did.  The genome did not stop mutating, 
<br>
changing or evolving.  It is the natural selection stage that is 
<br>
changed by language.  Language allows humans to pass on information 
<br>
and techniques that help improve survival.  Thus the methods for 
<br>
survival are no longer limited to our DNA (hence transhumanism). 
<br>
However, our DNA still mutates and evolves at the same natural rate 
<br>
it always did.  It is a common mistake to assume that evolution is 
<br>
&quot;motivated&quot; by a goal.  It is driven by randomness and then selected 
<br>
by what works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Moreover, I find the idea that we should follow an 'optimum' set of rules
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;homosexuals?  &quot;It isn't natural ...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Of course, this was always a bogus argument since virtually all 
<br>
societies of humans and species of mammals produce homosexuals 
<br>
regularly.
