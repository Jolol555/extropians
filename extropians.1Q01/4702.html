<p><em>&gt; We're seeing at least one example, today, of an entire industry being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven to the brink by improvements in its own efficiency and competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on price. Agriculture!
</em><br>
<p>What we're seeing with agriculture, far as I've been able to determine, is
<br>
not based on anything close to a free market economy. The problem with
<br>
agriculture (as opposed to horticulture) is that it's NOT efficient. In its
<br>
early days it flourished through the use of variants of slave labor. While
<br>
members of elite groups fared well, most people were apparently worse off
<br>
living within agricultural societies than their ancestors had been living as
<br>
hunter-gatherer-horticulturalists.
<br>
<p>More recently agriculture has maintained an appearance of efficiency through
<br>
the use of machinery mostly run on fossil fuel. It's true that yields per
<br>
person directly involved in farm labor have increased; but yields of food
<br>
calories per calorie of energy expended have dropped. A few months ago there
<br>
was a thread on this list analyzing the cost of producing energy from corn.
<br>
Even this analysis failed (if I read it correctly) to take into account the
<br>
energy used in producing the farm equipment (mining iron ore, producing and
<br>
shipping steel, producing and shipping machine tools, and so forth).
<br>
Governments have recently heavily subsidized the agricultural industry and
<br>
can, of course, continue to do so. But yields in many parts of the US have
<br>
been decreasing recently (I don't have reliable info on the rest of the
<br>
world) as &quot;fossil&quot; aquifers are depleted, topsoil is eroded, and fields
<br>
collect too much sodium from irrigation water. And the cost of producing
<br>
fossil fuel will likely rise.
<br>
<p>Agriculture is an example of using brute force technology rather than smart
<br>
technology. It might be fine as a primer or jump start for civilization, but
<br>
it should have been only that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; (Note that price supports in France serve a radically different purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the UK -- France has this tradition of rural living, the ideal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the peasant farmer as a way of life to aspire to, and the cottage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country with its own kitchen garden -- which puts different social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressures on the system.
</em><br>
<p>At least one usually gets a higher quality food through this sort of
<br>
subsidization, but it still comes at the expense of any real improvement in
<br>
efficiency.
<br>
<p>The ultimate answer may turn out to be nanotechnology. I think the closest
<br>
approximations we have to nanotechnology that's available at this moment are
<br>
horticultural systems such as permaculture where there's an attempt made to
<br>
understand how systems of plants and animals work most efficiently in terms
<br>
of energy consumed and produced (as opposed to only considering the number
<br>
of human hours directly devoted to farming). When you think about it,
<br>
producing energy via the work of millions of mitochondria IS food production
<br>
at a molecular level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; obesity levels are rising
</em><br>
<p>I think this is probably due more to changes in lifestyle rather than amount
<br>
of food consumed. I saw an article recently on the increasing reliance on
<br>
the car in Australia that said Australians are on the average getting fatter
<br>
these days as they spend more time in cars rather than on foot or bicycle.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;it can't bring in enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money to operate effectively.
</em><br>
<p>I've asked for permission to forward a post from a farming list I'm on. It's
<br>
from a woman who runs a small dairy in Pennsylvania. She comments that with
<br>
10 cows she and her husband are clearing a higher net profit than 1000+ cow
<br>
dairies where the owners are in debt up to their eyeballs for all the
<br>
expensive equipment, chemicals, and so forth.
<br>
<p>As in so many areas of life, people seem to have a compulsion to make things
<br>
harder than they have to be.
<br>
