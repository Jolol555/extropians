Ah, yes--the little-known &quot;Billy-Bob Effect.&quot; I'm assuming this was 
<br>
not a brand-spanking-new-very-shiny pickup with all the trimmings?

<em>&gt; quotes: &lt;&lt; &gt;Most all of my black friends (or African Americans if you prefer)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends, etc. And these are all middle to upper class people.  They just

<em>&gt; I don't wish to divert you from your theme but just to add something to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pot.  If you are white and don't believe there is such a thing as the cops 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picking on &quot;target&quot; groups start driving a pickup truck.  I have driven a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pick up at times in my life but an auto much more often yet a good 80% of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stops have been while in the pick up.  Furthermore the nature of the stops 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are such that I have never received a payable ticket during one of those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pickup stops.  Either no ticket was issued or it was nonsense and easily 
</em><br>
