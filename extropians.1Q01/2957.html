Rather than worrying about payloads and ways of getting people like us to
<br>
other places in the universe, perhaps lets put the effort into creating
<br>
life-forms which would transport better, require less life support, and
<br>
evolve-devolve once they reach a new environment.  Think about the microbial
<br>
world where the same organism can assume different forms in different phases
<br>
of its existance.   I'd better like a 1,000 trillion dollars of effort spent
<br>
so that we design a space-faring race rather than the same 1,000 trillion
<br>
spent to create, move and perpetuate earth like biodomes elsewhere in the
<br>
universe.  After all who ever said life on other planets should look like or
<br>
resemble in any way life here.  We are just the seed.. We could put AI's to
<br>
work for decades on this problem.  As with other Quasi-military programs the
<br>
spin-offs for those of us left here on earth will at very least to give the
<br>
human race some direction and hope for the future.
