[Note to Extro readers: Herewith, some recent parts of a discussion I
<br>
have been having off line. Apologies for the reverse chronological
<br>
layout....]
<br>
<p>Since what we can actually do with MNT today is nonexistent, i.e., since
<br>
MNT doesn't exist yet, there is a lot of &quot;here there be dragons&quot;
<br>
sentiment possible once you hear of the concept of gray goo. It's a very
<br>
powerful image of an utter earthly cataclysm. It behooves us to address
<br>
this as prudently as we are able.
<br>
<p>The first thing to be published that might qualify as &quot;research&quot; on gray
<br>
goo is Robert Freitas, _Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous
<br>
Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations_, available online
<br>
(I think the URL is www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html).
<br>
I think there may be some holes in that. Go for it!
<br>
<p>See also the Foresight proposed guidelines on MNT research, modeled
<br>
after the accepted guidelines for biology. 
<br>
<p>These are recent, concrete attempts to formally and publicly address
<br>
this issue. And please note that various people in the media are having
<br>
fun with how wiggy, far out and science fictional these documents are,
<br>
since they can always get a sound bite from some scientist saying that
<br>
assemblers, replicators or disassemblers are utter bilge. Well, they're
<br>
not utter bilge just because they don't show up on his radar.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned, and as I suspect Eric might agree, a bigger risk is from
<br>
things closer to home: biotech hybridized or enhanced, with or without
<br>
MNT. Bio already has the replication trick down.
<br>
<p>Now, do you want to call anything that replicates and kills people &quot;gray
<br>
goo&quot;? I don't.

<em>&gt; &gt;I think the evidence is clear that a red or green goo event is MUCH more

<em>&gt; &gt;These are both names for biovores based on extant biology with a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all mammals contracting Ebola), green goo attacks plants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Gray goo _qua_ gray goo is much more difficult to do. This doesn't mean

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Relinquishment, however, is clearly impossible; thus its desirability need
