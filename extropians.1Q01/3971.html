Re: gender percentages of 'extropians'

<p><em>&gt;This stated percentage appears too low to me. (Just a guess, but

<p>I should have stated my reasoning for the above, which is that I've
<br>
noticed more female participation in the discussions on this list
<br>
than, say, 8-10 years ago. My own participation with this group has
<br>
waxed and waned in that same time-frame, though, so my observation
<br>
could be severely biased.
<br>
<p>In addition: the gender ratio that I've seen at the Extros. I didn't
<br>
go to the previous Extro, but I was at the other three (does Mark
<br>
Desilet's Santa Cruz extropaganza count too?), and I noticed roughly
<br>
1/3 women there. These women were not primarily partners/spouses of
<br>
the others, either.

<p>True.

<p>E. Shaun graciously didn't tell that I was not one of those females

that he counted in the above Extropy membership numbers. :-(

(Thank you for being kind, Shaun)

</em><br>
<p>I don't know about 'radical', but I can tell you some things about the
<br>
sciences in the US and in Germany.
<br>
<p>In my U.S. physics courses (&gt;10 years ago), ~1 in 10 were women.
<br>
In my U.S. astrophysics courses (&gt;10 years ago), ~1 in 5 were women.
<br>
<p>In my professional astronomy conferences now (European and US), the
<br>
gender percentage is about 20% women (Europe), 25-35% women (U.S.) 
<br>
<p>In Germany the gender ratio in physics and astronomy courses is
<br>
about 1 in 30-50 being women (that's what I am told since I've not
<br>
taken courses in Germany). In my Max Planck Institute, which is a
<br>
mix of different professional physics researches of 300-400 people,
<br>
the gender ratio is about 1 in 50-100 being women. Most of the women
<br>
physicists at my Institute are not German, they are foreigners (BTW,
<br>
I'm the only one at my Institute being American). It's very unusual
<br>
to find women German physicists/astronomers.
<br>
<p>In the last 3 years, though, a large dropoff has occurred for people
<br>
of both genders going into PhD programs, so that most German
<br>
researchers are having trouble finding students. The sciences are
<br>
not an attractive career option for young people in Germany,
<br>
apparently.
