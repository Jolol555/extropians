<p>By far the most interesting claim by NIMBY-haters is that everyone seems to
<br>
be NIMBY-ist except them - therefore it is not only alright to make broad
<br>
generalizations and tar everyone with the same brush.
<br>
<p>As popular as California-bashing seems to be, especially amongst those that
<br>
hold right-of-center sociopolitical views, most Californians didn't support
<br>
the abandonment of power-plant construction.  As many modern elections in 
<br>
the US have shown, it is often the most vocal, motivated minorities who 
<br>
make decisions about who gets elected and what gets done, as opposed to the
<br>
more laid-back &quot;Why should I fight for it because everyone I know seems to 
<br>
agree that this is okay just as it is?&quot; attitude that seems to permeate the
<br>
general populace.
<br>
<p>Of course, there's also the perennial sport of the captain, the first mate, 
<br>
and the engineer all bickering over whose fault it is that the ship struck
<br>
an iceberg and is slowly sinking, instead of agreeing that maybe they should
<br>
patch the hole before it gets too late.  It is, after all, easier to point 
<br>
fingers and lay blame than it is to offer thoughtful, complete analysis of
<br>
a problem and a solution based on that analysis.  The latter doesn't get as
<br>
much attention.
<br>
<p>For the part of suggesting a limited analysis and potential solution, I offer
<br>
this:
<br>
<p>Power generation and distribution in this country is wasteful and inefficient
<br>
specifically because it is centrally produced and then distributed.  This 
<br>
situation leads to a number of negative effects on the market, from localized
<br>
rural distribution failures that can have regional impacts (the blackouts a 
<br>
few years back caused by the failure of transmission lines along the CA/OR
<br>
border) to price pressures introduced by extra-regional entities and forces.
<br>
A general drought in the Pacific northwest can result in power issues in 
<br>
California, for example, because a lot of the power from Bonneville is routed
<br>
to California.  Add to this the large amount of energy lost in the transmission
<br>
process (line resistance, power loss in converting from DC to AC and back to
<br>
DC, etc.), and the existing situation makes absolutely no sense.
<br>
<p>The extreme alternative would be point-generation - the production of power at
<br>
a single location sufficient to provide the power needs of that location.  
<br>
Unfortunately, not really economically feasable, since most point-generation
<br>
systems are still expensive and/or unreliable on a 7x24 basis (yes, solar power
<br>
is unreliable - try generating power from a solar rig at midnight).  However,
<br>
a more localized solution is possible - community power services provided by
<br>
a pooled fuel cell and localized distribution over an area similar to a 
<br>
homeowner's association region.  Over such a small area, DC transmission is 
<br>
possible, and the initial cost of the fuel-cell rig is distributed over a 
<br>
number of buyers.  In the case of apartment buildings, the fuel cell cost could
<br>
be factored into unit rentals.
<br>
<p>See, no NIMBY, no central bureaucracy or government impositions, no anti-
<br>
market activity... it's not that hard.  
<br>
