<p>You're not sure about what? The value of understanding failed cultures? The
<br>
value of historical knowledge in general? We don't know who built Nan Madol,
<br>
why they built it, when they built it, how they built it, what became of
<br>
them...we don't really know much about it at all because it's never been 
<br>
studied extensively. Obviously, some questions about it are unanswerable,
<br>
but the answers we can get may may change fundamental understanding of early
<br>
civilization and could lead to better understanding of human nature.
<br>
<p>Nan Madol makes Stonehenge look like a sandcastle. Yet *everybody* knows
<br>
about Stonehenge: that it exists, that it was built by Druidic people, that
<br>
it seems to have had a ceremonial purpose and functioned as a calendar of
<br>
sorts.
<br>
<p>Nan Madol is a series of nearly a hundred man-made islands and canals with
<br>
massive structures built from 30- to 50-ton basalt columns. Few people know
<br>
it exists. Nobody knows anything about the builders. The site has never been
<br>
rigorously surveyed or studied. It's currently a minor tourist attraction.
<br>
Much of it is still overgrown and unexplored. I find this incomprehensible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Maybe everyone's too busy working riddles. But Nan Madol is real world
</em><br>

<em>&gt; You are not referring to the magic which made the basalt monoliths

</em><br>
<p>No, not at all. I'm referring to the types of things I just listed above.
