<em>&gt;Why would we want to be presented in a carnival atmosphere like that?

<p>John Calvin replied:
<br>
because thats where the people are.
<br>
<p>Not to mention the fact that many people will not sit for a dry 
<br>
lecture and need to be shown that the future can be fun.

<p>The artistic skills of people like Natasha could really make for an eye-catching booth.  We would need several of our best people to in a friendly and yet very intelligent way represent our beliefs.  It will be very possible that they will be running into well-meaning or not so well-meaning people who can debate our views rather well.  Yes, bright and educated folks do attend state fairs! lol
<br>
<p>Somehow I conceive of this booth as being something like a recruitment table set up by a college fraternity.  We would be looking for proto-extropians who would join up if they only knew about us.  Teenagers and college students would be a demographic we should definitely target if this idea is actually carried out.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
