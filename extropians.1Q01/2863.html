<p>I'd be interested to know on which data you base this assertion. If it were 
<br>
true that thinking is not genetically based, then there would seem to be 
<br>
little point in attempting to increase human intelligence via genetic 
<br>
engineering.
<br>
<p>You have not explicitly stated what you believe to be the source of the 
<br>
ability to think, but the following implies that you believe training has 
<br>
at least some positive effect:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, there is some actual evidence that beyond a certain point in life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the brain is not exactly very malleable to learning some foundational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things including formal operations.
</em><br>
<p>I'm fairly certain that on other occasions you have stated that wealth is 
<br>
created rather than being a static store of resources to be divided among 
<br>
people. It would seem to follow that the more thinking people there are 
<br>
(who have also been trained to put their thinking into action to create 
<br>
wealth), the more wealth there would be. It would also seem to follow that 
<br>
there would be a greater chance of progress if there were more people with 
<br>
the ability to think.
<br>
<p>Following this line of reasoning, it seems as though you would consider it 
<br>
worthwhile to invest in providing good nutrition and early training for as 
<br>
many children as possible. I realize this would in no way provide 
<br>
justification for anyone to force you to make such an investment against 
<br>
your will. Given that as a constraint, however, it might be useful to look 
<br>
for ways of providing good nutrition and early training for children whose 
<br>
parents cannot afford it (or who do not choose to provide it for them).
<br>
<p>With respect to compensation for work you say:
<br>
<p>(in response to Charlie, who said &quot; Behind every aerospace engineer or chip
<br>
<em> &gt; designer there's a small army of people working supermarket checkouts and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; farms and food factories (so the engineers don't have to hunt their 
</em><br>
food...&quot;}
<br>
<p>Samantha: &quot;Yes, and each and everyone one of them is paid the market value 
<br>
of their
<br>
contribution already.  So exactly why do they deserve a cut of someone
<br>
else's contribution?&quot;
<br>
<p>Is it really true, though, that every worker is paid the market value of 
<br>
their contribution?  In an ideal situation in which there were perfect 
<br>
information, perfect flow of goods and services from one region to another, 
<br>
and so forth--AND free market conditions, this might be true. In fact, none 
<br>
of these ideal conditions exist. I don't believe it's possible for them to 
<br>
exist in any but small, locally governed groups of people.
<br>
<p>You said (in an earlier post),
<br>
<p>&quot;...This assumes a &quot;normal world&quot; of job opportunity distributed
<br>
across most intelligence levels of the population. What about the
<br>
world, by local beliefs coming rapidly, where only the top of the
<br>
intelligence pool can be gainfully employed (with a few service jobs to
<br>
one side)? Eventually there may not be anything a given worker can be
<br>
trained to do that pays a living wage and there may be no region that
<br>
requires such workers. What then?&quot;
<br>
<p>This doesn't just describe the future. This describes right now for many 
<br>
people. I personally know a number of people who are unable to get work 
<br>
because of minimum wage laws--the minimum wage has priced their services 
<br>
out of the market. OTOH such laws have resulted in price inflation which 
<br>
make it nearly impossible to live on earnings based on minimum wage.
<br>
<p>You have said that it's not very useful to try to train people to think 
<br>
after they reach a certain age. I ask your own question with a slight 
<br>
change. What now?
