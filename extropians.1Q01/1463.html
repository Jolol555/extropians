<p>Something else to consider: Authorities and leaders are often set in 
<br>
their ways, resistant to change, perpetuating the status quo as it is-
<br>
-no further decay required. Many if not most people follow leaders. 
<br>
If leaders become immortal, and remain resistant to change--society 
<br>
itself stagnates.
<br>
<p>Example--suppose Mediaeval Church leaders had been rendered immortal. 
<br>
It seems likely that in such an event, we would still be burning 
<br>
heretics like Bruno at the stake. Turnover is Nature's way of 
<br>
ensuring constant advance. Rendering the body immortal does not cure 
<br>
cerebral ossification. (Make no mistake, however: I wanna be 
<br>
immortal.)

we need to be plastic and update our estimates over time (learning

which fields are changing and which are more static); this is why old

have been held in high esteem beside their rarity in most societies -
<br>
they were likely knowledgeable - and why in our current dynamic
<br>
societies they are less relevant. 
<br>
<p>I think what you're saying is that in times past the old were 
<br>
repositories of accumulated knowledge the relevance of which did not 
<br>
change--whereas today most of what one learned more than ten or even 
<br>
five years ago can be completely irrelevant, so no one gives a rip 
<br>
about the old because the really recent, relevant stuff they already 
<br>
know themselves(?). Fascinating take; no doubt largely correct for 
<br>
many fields. 
<br>
<p>Such a narrow view on the part of the young, however, is to their 
<br>
extreme disadvantage; it completely discounts wisdom, people skills, 
<br>
insight, cross-fertilization based on knowledge of several fields, 
<br>
etc.
