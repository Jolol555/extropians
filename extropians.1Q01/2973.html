<p>**Not at all; we gotta SURVIVE here first. I'm not one of these &quot;Wait-

<p>**I don't disagree with any of this below, except d (because we keep

manufacturing graver threats to our own survival). If the $14-for$1

figure is accurate (source would be great), which I hope to hell it 
<br>
is--why the huge problem in getting space program expansion? Should 
<br>
be a no-brainer, even for the pols. Gotta be a matter of public 
<br>
perception; that can be changed if the figures are there to back it 
<br>
up. I think it should be done even if it's a total write-off--but, 
<br>
hey, that's just me.

<em>&gt; a) space investment generates $14 in the economy for every dollar spent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the highest of any government program in history (which typically return
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; far more to 'fix our problems here' than liberal tax and spend nanny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare state handouts ever did. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) Note since the Apollo program was shut down in favor of funding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Great Society, that program actually increased the number and percentage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people living in poverty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; d) If we made it through this past century, the odds of human
