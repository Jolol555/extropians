<p>That does sound pretty amazing.  I'm looking forward to reading about it in the
<br>
technical journals.
<br>
<p>However I have become suspicious about this kind of reporting after all
<br>
the fuss over the experiment where light supposedly exited the chamber
<br>
before it entered.  See the thread from this past summer &quot;FTL on Nature&quot;,
<br>
starting from <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q00/1614.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q00/1614.html</a>
<br>
and following the thread links.  That was a case of terrible misreporting.
<br>
<p>The new experiment sounds somewhat similar except they've turned it
<br>
around and are pushing the light wave back at the speed of light, maybe.
<br>
I'm guessing that what they are really doing is transforming the light
<br>
into excited gas molecules, which they then liberate.  Of course that
<br>
happens all the time in nature but in this case they must be able to
<br>
preserve the phase information, which would be an important advancement,
<br>
and as John says could have practical usage in quantum computers as well
<br>
as quantum cryptography, perhaps.
<br>
<p>BTW I've been trying to work out a new idea for quantum cryptography.
<br>
You may have heard of the &quot;Dining Cryptographers Net&quot;, a crypto protocol
<br>
for anonymous communication.  My variant uses photons so I call it the
<br>
&quot;Shining Cryptographers Net&quot;.  It doesn't require pre-shared keys as the
<br>
DC Net does.  I've been discussing it on Perry Metzger's cryptography
<br>
mailing list.
