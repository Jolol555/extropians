</em><br>
<p>Huh? This is extremely different from what I read in the book. He is
<br>
describing a very quickly evolving ecology/market in the solar system,
<br>
pointing out that economic pressures might be forcing latecomers to
<br>
make some possibly painful adaptions (this part is from his old &quot;Pigs
<br>
in cyberspace&quot; essay). As far as I can recall he did not succumb to
<br>
the popular but unsupported &quot;first to become posthuman gets to be God&quot;
<br>
idea (this idea assumes both the possibility and economic desirability
<br>
of total autarchy and that the distribution of power would become
<br>
discontinous by an autoevolutive singularity - Moravec doesn't seem to
<br>
be a singularitian himself, rather a gradualist).
