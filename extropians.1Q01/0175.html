</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0. A good survival manual, esp. on how to survive on a desert island.
</em><br>
<p>I would actually recommend &quot;Back to Basics&quot; (Either ROdale or Reader's Digest
<br>
Press, can't remember which right now) - an incredibly good book on modern
<br>
and traditional methods of construction, food prepartion and storage, crafts,
<br>
etc.  Everythign from how to lay a stone wall without mortar to Ahmish 
<br>
barnraising to lumbering with a chainsaw, from underground houses with heat
<br>
pumps to adobe dwellings, from salting to canning, from dye-making to 
<br>
cloth-making and papermaking.  A good foundation for book #2, as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. A good book on the local flora and fauna.
</em><br>
<p>The best book I've seen for &quot;survival&quot; situations was one I encountered back
<br>
in the late 80s, titled &quot;The SAS Manual - Survive Anywhere Safely&quot; that was
<br>
supposedly culled from the British RAF survival manuals.  It included sections
<br>
on how to survive a life-threatening situation (avalanche, plane or auto
<br>
crash, etc.), first aid with an eye towards self-administration (I remember
<br>
some useful tips about how to splint your own broken arm - not something you'd
<br>
see in many first aid manuals), construction of emergency shelter, techniques
<br>
for starting a fire, and plants and animals common and edible around the 
<br>
world.  Far more useful than a simple field guide to edible plants, this book 
<br>
would get you through the roughest two weeks at th ebeginning, getting you
<br>
set up to the point where you can use the information in the other two to start
<br>
getting you ahead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. A good book on how to create machines using low tech.
</em><br>
<p>One I HAVE to look up is by a Danish author who wrote a book on how to make
<br>
your own tools, basically a bootstrap manual to such complex devices as 
<br>
highly accurate spanners and calipers, metal and wood lathes, kilns and 
<br>
furnaces.
<br>
<p>Interestingly enough, were there some sort of nuclear war or other form of 
<br>
global holocaust, these three books would be the core needed to get 
<br>
civilization back up and running.  
<br>
<p>For the more technophillic, there is a company that manufactures a folding
<br>
photovoltaic set that can power a laptop and recharge its batteries - so
<br>
the Powerbook idea isn't as bad a one as it sounds at first.  Of course, making
<br>
sure you have all the information you'd need is another story...
