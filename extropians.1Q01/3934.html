</em><br>
<p><p>Indeed, one of the tragedies of the synthesizer market has been that they 
<br>
tried to sell them on their weaknesses (e.g. the (poor) emulation of 
<br>
acoustic instruments) rather than on their strengths (e.g. a synthesizers 
<br>
ability to create a very broad spectrum of musical timbres not possible 
<br>
with acoustic instruments).  Both violins and synthesizers are deep sonic 
<br>
tools with unique capabilities and using one to emulate the other is a 
<br>
fool's errand for the most part*.  Its analogous to comparing trucks to 
<br>
sports cars -- different tools for different jobs.
<br>
<p>*As DSPs become faster and faster, computers are becoming increasingly 
<br>
adept at modeling complex physical acoustic processes.  In a relatively 
<br>
short period of time, we may in fact have synthetic violins that can fully 
<br>
reproduce every nuance of the real thing.  Moore's law is allowing the use 
<br>
of fewer and fewer approximations in these models and more physical 
<br>
component detail, which is leading to the inevitable convergence of the 
<br>
computer models with their acoustic counterparts in terms of real-time 
<br>
acoustic detail and nuance.  The current detractors of physical modeling 
<br>
are akin to the same people who pronounced CDs to be dead-on-arrival 
<br>
because of sound quality problems that plagued the new technology.  The 
<br>
complaints were valid at the time, but engineers quickly fixed the problems 
<br>
and now no one credibly disputes the inferiority of analog 
<br>
formats.  Lacking theoretical limitations, new technologies will eventually 
<br>
approach the theoretical limits of their design.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The problem with the neo-luddites is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they would say that we shouldn't have synthesizers at all because having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them necessarily implies a rejection of violins.  They're wrong.
</em><br>
<p><p>In many ways it is worse than this.  Neo-luddites continuously denigrate 
<br>
technology as being destructive to &quot;natural diversity&quot;, which clearly 
<br>
doesn't really mean diversity in any kind of dictionary sense.  &quot;Diversity&quot; 
<br>
has been co-opted to mean &quot;things that we like&quot;.  Its kind of like defining 
<br>
&quot;you may eat any kind of poultry you like&quot; as &quot;you can't eat beef&quot;.  The 
<br>
former doesn't imply the latter, nor is the latter exclusive of the former, 
<br>
yet they use it like that.
<br>
<p>Allowing someone (e.g. the government) to define diversity (and enforce its 
<br>
existence as &quot;a good thing&quot;) is effectively granting someone autocratic 
<br>
power.  The obscenity is that &quot;diversity&quot;, pretty much by definition, 
<br>
happens as the consequence of evolution and allows populations to change 
<br>
without bound, not within the confines or consequence of a decree, which 
<br>
actually serves to limit diversity regardless of how one frames it.
