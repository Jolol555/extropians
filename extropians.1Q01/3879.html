</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is so much crap, like 'only us black people can use the 'n' word'.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we obviously disagree on this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Depends on who you are accusing me of being bigoted against. Its funny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how you agreed entirely with Greg's commentary on the contrast between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-trust and high-trust societies, but you can't accept what I am
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I guess he just used a more reasonable, less inflammatory approach. As you may have noticed from my posts,
<br>
I have much more of a problem with your style than your content.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Now, are you claiming that I am making a blanket statement about all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immigrants?
</em><br>
<p>No, I said it could appear that way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This low-trust/high-trust dichotomy is the primary reason why many rural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people distrust immigrants and city dwellers: said immigrants and city
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dwellers are, by continuous example, posessed of low-trust mindsets, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore are treated as the low-trustworthy individuals that they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While this is stereotyping it is nevertheless real. Ever notice how city
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people portray country people as gullible naive bumpkins? Its because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those country people are high-trust types who haven't had their bubbles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burst yet by big city cynicism and con games.
</em><br>
<p>As someone who lives in a small country town, I understand this completely.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; A 'balanced approach' won't cut it, as I've shown. They are not interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in compromise, in cutting a deal, in being 'balanced'. He who sits on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fence winds up nailed to a cross of fenceposts.
</em><br>
<p>Well, again we simply disagree.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If we are to take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'balanced approach' as you claim, how can you justify the decimation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the South and the killing of 300,000 people in a war to forcibly end a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural practice that was perfectly legal in the states which legally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Constitutionally chose to secede from the Union? Far more people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were killed or disabled in the War than were freed by the Emancipation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Proclamation, and Lincoln's goal of bringing the South back into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Union was in contravention to the US Constitution's own basis. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to condemn imperialism, then what do you have to say about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this?
</em><br>
<p>I say that I can't speak for people from 150 years ago, but only for myself in the world in which I live.
<br>
It's fruitless to speculate about what could have happened (unless you have a time machine!). As for your
<br>
last question, I have and always will condemn this imperialism, not because I support slavery, but because
<br>
there is compelling evidence that the war took place for reasons other than to abolish slavery. I think
<br>
there were already forces at work in the south that would have ended slavery anyway. Again, though,
<br>
there's no way we can ever know.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Oh please, give me a break. This is just more rationalization through hindsight. Why can't you, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-proclaimed advocate of liberty and self-determination, see how specious an argument this is?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It worked in the Civil War, the Spanish American War, WWII, and the Cold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War.
</em><br>
<p>How exactly is this an answer to my question? This just supports my claim that you're rationalilizing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes that involved conflict and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; violence dealing with adherents of the old order who wanted to retain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; their 'right' to continue to oppress their people. If you insist that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they have the right to oppress and be oppressed, then you must also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; accept the idea that some cultures cannot become libertarian or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; democratic, and that some people cannot appreciate individual liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Again (yawn), I'm not saying this. Please don't put words in my mouth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its a rational logical extension of your claims. Explain yourself or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concede the point.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this is just your own interpretation. I concede nothing, because there is nothing to concede. I
<br>
have and continue to explain myself in clear, non-inflammatory language, which is enough. If you insist on
<br>
not hearing me, or in misinterpreting what I say, there's nothing more I can do. It's obvious that your
<br>
mind is already made up and you aren't willing to listen to anyone who sees things differently than you.
<br>
This is a sad way to go through life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Hmmm. Where did this come from? Since I have neither claimed to be a leftist, or mentioned ancient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Athens, I'm wondering why you threw this in. By the way, I agree with your assessment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well thats a switch. Not going to become an Athenian apologist?
</em><br>
<p>It's not a switch at all, and I 'm not an apologist for anyone. This is just more cheap tactics on your
<br>
part.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Oh, I see. I'm a communist because you say I am, even though I repeatedly tell you I'm not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are really not I apologize, however you are being way too much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an apologist for their standpoints  and propaganda memes for me to not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider the issue.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'm not an apologist for any one position. I just to prefer to keep an open mind. This is not the
<br>
same thing as support.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I suppose zyklon B, in the hands of a responsible exterminator, is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dandy for termites, it's just an abused, misunderstood poison that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffers from the revisionistic cultural imperialism of the Allies.... I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope you are intelligent enough to comprehend irony...
</em><br>
<p>Well, I would never say that, but it's a nice irony.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; it doesn't mean that anyone who uses them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AT ALL is somehow (unknown to themselves) a member of said group. This is ridiculous, and is the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of useless labeling I will continue to call you on. Oh, and I'm not interested in &quot;taking power&quot; over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything except my own life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then stop making excuses for them.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not making excuses for anyone. You are.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Then why have you been continually bringing up corporations?
</em><br>
<p>Because I was trying to show how you seemed to be an apologist for their actions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You regularly claim that abuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; committed by governments are actually just the governments being the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lackeys of corporations. This focus on corporations as if they are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; primary source of power is indicative of your primary orientation (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that of 'anarchist' socialists in general).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Again, I have never said this. Why do you feel the need to make me into something I'm not? If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need an enemy that fits this description, look elsewhere. All I have ever claimed in regard to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matter is that corporations have and do commit acts of oppression, but ALWAYS in collusion with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; governments. And I have repeatedly said that I am interested in looking at all factors, not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blaming one group or another. Again, is this too subtle?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have, at best, now that you have been called out, trying to portray
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations and governments as equally evil.
</em><br>
<p>Still you don't hear what I am saying. Let me try one last time: I am not saying governments and
<br>
corporations are equally evil, I'm just saying that sometimes corporations commit evil acts and we should
<br>
not excuse their behavior because other groups (namely, governments) commit more and worse evils. Why is
<br>
this too subtle a distinction for you to grasp?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; History demonstrates that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations are a speck of a pustule on the back of the history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government oppression of the individual. Ok, who is more evil: a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who kills one person so he can feed his family, or a person who kills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1000 people just because its fun (especially when they beg)? Time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make actual DECISIONS here Neal. Pick a side.
</em><br>
<p>See, Michael, that's the problem. I'm not a side picker. That is too simplistic a view of life for me. I
<br>
just don't see things that way. I want a limitless future, not one locked into rigid ways of looking at
<br>
things. This seems counter-extropian to me.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Thinking is fine, Neal. At some point you have to make a decision,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though, or your thinking isn't worth spit.
</em><br>
<p>I make plenty of decisions every day. Just because I don't make the decision you want me to make doesn't
<br>
make my thinking worthless.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Deciding then that all decisions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally bad is wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I definitely never advocated this. Again, you're misinterpreting me.
<br>
<p><p>It's become painfully obvious to me that while you and I have some common ground, we diverge widely on
<br>
such things as appropriateness of rhetorical style, interpretation of history, and political persuasion.
<br>
You seem convinced that I'm a leftist, as if that label really contains any useful information, and I
<br>
continue to insist that while I may agree with some leftist positions some of the time, it in no way
<br>
defines or limits me. I like to use an eclectic approach to life and its problems, and to keep an open and
<br>
flexible mind. I refuse to be pigeonholed, and I won't do it to someone else in order to make my argument
<br>
easier. Reason and respect are much more useful tools to me.
<br>
<p>So I think we should just agree to disagree, and let this go. If you want to continue our &quot;debate&quot;
<br>
offlist, I welcome it. Otherwise, I think we should stop bombarding everyone else with our rhetoric. I'm
<br>
sure it's becoming tiresome to someone other than me.
