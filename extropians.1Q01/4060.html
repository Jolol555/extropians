LOL!
<br>
<p>Still trying to figure out whether you're serious about this stuff. 
<br>
You really tread the line.
<br>
<p>Seems to me what you REALLY need are some of those little gray guys 
<br>
with the tiny bodies and the big heads; I mean, how much can they 
<br>
eat? Recruiting these guys/gals/critters would also neatly solve your 
<br>
transportation problem; they've already gotten here from (presumably) 
<br>
considerably farther places than Mars--so intrasystem travel shoulod 
<br>
be a real snap for them.
<br>
<p>Better yet--just hitch a ride!
<br>
<p>Perhaps you might offer your services (or the services of others) as 
<br>
an experimental subject in exchange for transportaion of personnel 
<br>
and equipment/supplies. Hey, it's a thought...

<em>&gt; Actually John, we discussed this about a year ago, but I have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I am not guaranteeing that I will ever do so.  Dont know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Hi!  Im a six foot rocket scientist interested in recruiting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    female from among you for a one way trip to Mars.  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    much do you weigh?  How much do you eat?  How much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    do you *really* like this planet?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dont think so.  But I have learned some possibly useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information.  As it turns out, humans do not scale linearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with weight.  If all of my dimensions were cut in half, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; height would be 3 ft, my surface area would be a quarter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its current value and my weight one eighth.  So, 15 pounds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rocket scientist's dream, lets fly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as we said, humans do not scale linearly down.  Verne Troyer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the actor that played MiniMe in Austin Powers, is 2 ft 8 inches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but weighs almost 70 pounds.  I may tell later how I found this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out, but the fact is, for a Mars mission, this may not matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much.  It matters little what one weighs, but it matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly how much one eats, for this is a weight penalty that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be paid over and over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More on that later.  Regarding pygmies, it is much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to find info on this than on dwarfism, for there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very few pygmies online and no chat groups for pygmies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have been able to find.  I do not consider pygmies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal candidates for Mars missions for altho they tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be much smaller than most humans, there are language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barriers.  The !xhosa language has not been fully or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universally encoded into written form, and we are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long way from having machines that could recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and translate it.  Some insight into pygmies may be gained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from viewing the movie &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starred a pygmy actor whose dimensions were about 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ft and approximately 90 pounds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also--you have to feed and air-supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Air supply is not such a pressing problem, as oxygen can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regenerated from carbon dioxide, given sufficient energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Water too can be recycled, given an energy supply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the energy needed is proportional to the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the crew.  The feed problem: also proportional to the crew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before my next post in a week or so, be thinking this over:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What aspects of the mission scale linearly with the crew size?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What aspects scale as the square?  What scales as the cube?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I may prepare a full paper on this topic for the engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society to which I belong, the Society of Aerospace Weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Engineers.  spike
