<p><em>&gt;I recall reading once that Max More had changed his name from Connor or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Connolly or something like that because he didn't like the fact that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought he was Irish, and I've just read on [Tom's] web site that Tom Morrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't like to be addressed as Tom O. Morrow as he thinks that's sounds
</em><br>

<p>I've got nothing at all against things Irish.  Indeed, I proudly tout some 
<br>
Irish among my ancestors and have had *great* fun visiting Eire.  But as 
<br>
names go, one that connotes Irishness would sorely misdescribe me.  (The 
<br>
association would probably offend a great many Irish, too!)  So please 
<br>
understand my naming preferences as not anti-Irish but rather as pro-accuracy.
