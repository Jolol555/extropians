WASHINGTON
<br>
<p><p><p><p>It hurts to be smart. That's one conclusion from the latest study of
<br>
so-called Doogie mice - &quot;smart&quot; rodents that are genetically engineered to
<br>
have enhanced memory and learning skills.
<br>
Along with those extra IQ points, researchers have found, comes an added
<br>
sensitivity to pain. 
<br>
The new work offers a sobering lesson about the difficulty of enhancing
<br>
certain brain functions without simultaneously taking a toll on others. It
<br>
might temper any momentum to engineering genetic enhancements into people. 
<br>
Doogie mice, named after the main character in the television show Doogie
<br>
Howser, MD, made a big splash when they were introduced to the world in
<br>
September 1999. 
<br>
Having been endowed with extra copies of a gene involved in memory
<br>
formation, the animals outperformed their normal counterparts on a variety
<br>
of tasks. 
<br>
They were better at recognising objects they had seen before, remembered
<br>
painful experiences longer and recalled with greater accuracy the location
<br>
of submerged platforms in milky water.
<br>
Some scientists sniffed at the suggestion that the mice were brainy, noting
<br>
intelligence was much more than a collection of four or five mental skills. 
<br>
Nonetheless, the work was the first to show that, by adding a few extra
<br>
copies of a single gene to an embryo, researchers improved an animal's
<br>
performance on a range of memory and learning tasks. 
<br>
Some suggested drugs designed to mimic the gene's effects might help
<br>
Alzheimer's patients. The new work hints it won't be that easy. 
<br>
Min Zhou and his colleagues at Washington University School of Medicine in
<br>
St Louis assessed how Doogie mice responded to tissue damage and inflammation.
<br>
They suspected that pain caused by those types of injury might be
<br>
controlled by the same &quot;NR2B receptor&quot; Doogie mice are overendowed with and
<br>
that gives them their superior memories. 
<br>
NR2B receptors are proteins that act as &quot;coincidence detectors&quot; in the
<br>
brain. They recognise, for example, when a certain sound is linked to the
<br>
arrival of food and help consolidate such coincidences into learnt
<br>
associations. 
<br>
The researchers subjected the mice to stimuli that caused either short-term
<br>
or long-term pain. 
<br>
They heated the animals' tails, poked their foot pads with stiff fibres and
<br>
injected their paws with irritating solutions. Then they used neurological
<br>
tests to see how the animals' brains responded and tracked their behavior.
<br>
Those tests indicated that, compared with normal mice, Doogie mice were
<br>
equally sensitive to short-term pain. But chronic inflammatory pain, such
<br>
as that caused by the injected irritants, lasted longer in Doogie mice. 
<br>
&quot;Our results suggest that a genetic manipulation conferring enhanced
<br>
cognitive abilities may also provide unintended traits, such as increased
<br>
susceptibility to persistent pain,&quot; the team reports in yesterday's issue
<br>
of the journal Nature Neuroscience. 
<br>
Joe Tsien, the Princeton scientist who led the creation of Doogie mice,
<br>
said he wasn't convinced the mice felt more pain.
<br>
But several scientists said the new study offered strong substantiation
<br>
that a Doogie mouse's pain was real. 
<br>
&quot;This is very convincing evidence&quot; that the mice had prolonged chronic pain
<br>
responses, said James L. McGaugh, a neuroscientist at the University of
<br>
California at Irvine.
<br>
&quot;Most of our brain regions are multipurpose. These things are all
<br>
intertwined,&quot; he said.
