<em>&gt;Dr Tame, if you'd used the time spent composing this rebuke in googling for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the two items of information you asked me to send, you'd already have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;urls.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Not true - my reply took a second. Search engine searches can often take
<br>
unpredictably large amounts of time, and asking the original poster
<br>
first was a reasonable first step. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But why didn't I include the provenance in the first place, and why was I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irritated that you couldn't be bothered doing  your own search? Well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people on this list usually do include such information if it's at hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and seems salient. If it's missing, one might reasonably assume that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wasn't readily available. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not a reasonable assumption. Most people are very slack about including
<br>
full information on forwarded articles, and don't seem to realise why
<br>
such information is important. Many when asked are usually cheerfully
<br>
forthcoming. 
<br>
<p>Why you should find a polite request irritable and deserving of a snide
<br>
response tells a lot about you. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That is the case here. As well, I chose not to take the extra effort to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find and include it because I thought people would be interested in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas expressed, not where they first appeared in print. 
</em><br>
<p>Unreasonable assumption. For scholarly purposes full references are
<br>
vital. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(Besides, anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who did wish to track down the sources could readily do so, by googling to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Malik Kenan's name, combined with those of the two reviewers). I'd need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repeat those steps myself in order to recover those irrelevant details
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(irrelevant to me, if not to you, but then that's your business not mine),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and being hectored with news of your busy life doesn't really persuade me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make that effort. 
</em><br>
<p>If you don't like sarcastic replies then don't dish out snide responses
<br>
to a polite and reasonable request for information. As someone who
<br>
always tries to help others with reasonable requests I don't appreciate
<br>
smartass sarcasm. You got back what you dished out - tit for tat. Now
<br>
don't whine about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For a formal analysis of the two-way protocols involved, you might consult
</em><br>
<em>&gt;H. Paul Grice, on the Cooperative Principle and other principles of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conversational implicature (Grice, P., 1989, *Studies in the Way of Words*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press).

<p>Your response to my request indicates that whatever lessons it might
<br>
have to teach would probably be better studied by yourself.
<br>
<p>And that's enough of my time wasted with an unpleasant twat.
