<p>As a veteran, I can specifically say that the general purpose
<br>
disassembler you are freaky of has absolutely no military value
<br>
whatsoever. Weapons of mass destruction generally don't either, they are
<br>
political weapons. Any weapon that is as likely to kill the user as the
<br>
target has no value, since it gives no advantage to the user. Good
<br>
military nanotech disassemblers will target specific compounds that have
<br>
military value: phosphors used in night vision goggles, quartz crystals
<br>
used in optics, kevlar compounds in body armor, titanium and armor
<br>
ceramics, nitrocellulose munitions, mercury fulminate, food ration
<br>
packaging materials, burn treatment compounds, jock itch/athletes foot
<br>
medications, teflon (gaskets and other seals), turbine blade ceramics,
<br>
etc... or that will alter the properties of materials, such as remove
<br>
the springiness in springs so that the actions on firearms no longer
<br>
function, soften the metal in tank treads so they wear out and fall
<br>
apart sooner, convert gasoline molecules to flame retardants, de-dope
<br>
semiconductors, short dielectrics in klystron switches used in nukes,
<br>
turn toilet paper into nitrocellulose paper (which blows up in the
<br>
hand), etc...
<br>
<p>These types of targeted nanites will eliminate the enemy's ability to
<br>
conduct combat operations, which is the proper goal of war.
<br>
<p>Such nanites could have long term lingering impact upon the
<br>
technological infrastructure of an economy beyond just military devices
<br>
unless the enemy provides some means to deactivate them after the
<br>
conflict is over, and if they are highly mobile. They will not, however,
<br>
destroy the planet or exterminate the human race.
