</em><br>
<em>&gt; Notice that you started out blaming the system and forced curriculum,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but then admitted that the problem is more directly associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor teachers.  Not that I'm completely against more flexibility in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determining your own curriculum, but how would it solve the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of having poor teachers?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I gave my child the option of going to school or not, and she chose public
<br>
school because she wanted to be with her friends. My child's elementary
<br>
school teachers were all excellent. Every one of them seemed to truly care
<br>
about the kids and to love teaching, and every one of them complained about
<br>
the inflexible curriculum, the requirements only to use certain books and so
<br>
forth. It was impossible to do a good job teaching 25 or 30 children of
<br>
variying abilities and experience using the same curriculum and text books
<br>
for all.
<br>
<p>However, we were fortunate in having a school system that encouraged
<br>
parental involvement. Parents were welcome into the classroom at any time
<br>
with no appointment, and the teachers were always thrilled to have the extra
<br>
help. It's surprising how much difference one extra person can make in a
<br>
classroom. Based on my experience, one way to change schools for the better
<br>
would be for more parents to participate in the actual teaching. We had to
<br>
stick with the state mandated curriculum, but with extra help for the
<br>
teacher, you can do lots of other things too.
<br>
