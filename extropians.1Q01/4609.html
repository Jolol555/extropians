<em>&gt; Of course remember: if you really intend on /helping/ the companies in

<em>&gt; question, you have to invest during the IPO or before. Otherwise your
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Is this becuase you would just be purchasing stock owned by some random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person/org or is my fiscal ignorance even greater than I suspected?
</em><br>
<p>Correct. There actually are pretty limited ways to buy stock from the
<br>
company itself (so it gets your money and can use it). A company generally
<br>
gets its primary infusions of cash:
<br>
<p>a) when it first starts up some angels or other investors give it a little
<br>
bit of cash in exchange for large chunks of the company (since it ain't
<br>
worth much yet, their money buys a lot of it)
<br>
<p>b) as time goes on and the company's value increases, and it needs more
<br>
capital to fund itself, it takes in investment usually from VCs
<br>
<p>c) if things go really well it grows big enough to have an IPO. It sells
<br>
off a chunk of itself to the public market (you can buy IPO shares through
<br>
your broker usually).
<br>
<p>After that point you generally can't invest in the company directly, unless
<br>
they do what's called a secondary offering, which just means they print up
<br>
and dump some more shares into the public market. But you have to be careful
<br>
since executives, VCs, and other people that own shares may sell off theirs
<br>
too at that point- so your money might just go into their pockets. Actually
<br>
this can happen during the IPO itself, so read that prospectus...
<br>
<p>I would say Zyvex is at least 2 years away from an IPO, and probably more
<br>
than that.
