</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, up to the point of his search of your person (justified by
<br>
&quot;reasonable articulable suspicion&quot; or whatever the terminology is in
<br>
your jurisdiction--or not...).
<br>
<p>Your backup record has to be either off-body or hard to neutralize in
<br>
some other way (an organ?).
<br>
<p>Leaving the latter for down the road, I've sketched out a design that
<br>
uses Part 15 FM stereo, but I could really use help from a senior ham or
<br>
engineer, someone who's current with micro RF design, to help me finish
<br>
the design for dissemination. The simplest form just sends MPX stereo
<br>
(&quot;he said/she said&quot;) on a switch-selected fixed xtal synthesized
<br>
frequency. Mutual aid societies in a neighborhood could settle on one
<br>
frequency, or use scanners, though the stereo sep obviously goes away
<br>
with the latter. There remains a potential sticking point: FCC regs
<br>
regarding &quot;divulging an overheard communication&quot;. Not sure how to
<br>
finesse that and keep the neighborhood watch/copwatch angle solid.
<br>
<p>Why stereo? A straightforward refinement permits you to only transmit
<br>
your half of the conversation as the L+R signal; the other party's voice
<br>
is active canceled in this mode. So you have an out even if they refuse
<br>
to be recorded and you agree to stop. When you stop, you are stopping
<br>
recording/broadcasting *them*, but not yourself.
<br>
<p>Further refinements are straightforward. As is raw video on a separate
<br>
channel, which is generally not ruled unlawful unless there is a
<br>
&quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; (homes, dressing rooms, etc.). For
<br>
that, I'd get a ham license and use 432 MHz ATV, maybe.
<br>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but I do see all this coming. Soon.
