<p>Yup, sure does work that way.  Nowthen, you could not actually
<br>
ever *escape* the sun's gravity well if Minsky's notion were correct,
<br>
but you could spiral out ever farther.  Another way to state it is if
<br>
you have a sheet of aluminum more than about 600 atoms thick, you
<br>
cant use that as a sail to escape the sun's gravity.  But consider there
<br>
are other atoms lighter than aluminum, such as lithium, which are
<br>
reflective, and there is the possibility of a lithium sheet with a very
<br>
thin, highly reflective layer of silver with a thin coating of magnesium
<br>
flouride over top for protection from stray hydrogen atoms, etc.
<br>
<p>The thing that really steamed me about the whole thing was that
<br>
Dr. Minsky must have done a quick back of the envelope calc,
<br>
then accidentally used the earth's gravitational attraction instead of
<br>
the sun's, thus missing the answer by more than a factor of 3000,
<br>
but hey, whats 3 orders of magnitude among friends, eh?  I would
<br>
let that slide.  But to say in front of a big audience that this shows
<br>
the whole notion of solar sailing could never work, well that simply
<br>
dismisses a field that has been studied for years by a bunch of
<br>
waaaay smart people.  Did he suppose that none of them had ever
<br>
stumbled upon his 3 lines of algebra that convinced him this was
<br>
all a flop?  Fer cryin out loud, how arrogant!
<br>
<p>Nowthen, the version I had heard about the Eliezer-Marvin exchange
<br>
at the nanoschmooze was fairly benign.  It sounded to me like
<br>
typical conference-ism, for speakers to intimidate their audiences
<br>
by shooting down some prominent questioner.  May the participants
<br>
shake hands and sit down together for a tall cold one.  spike
