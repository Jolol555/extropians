</em><br>
<p>First, he's (Terry Kok) part of the life-support taskforce in the Mars
<br>
society (<a href="http://home.marssociety.org/tech/life-support/htm/index.htm">http://home.marssociety.org/tech/life-support/htm/index.htm</a>).  You
<br>
can find him scattered throughout these pages.  As far as I know, he has
<br>
first taken himself off the water grid by using a series of hydroponic plant
<br>
beds to filter his water.  I don't know the details, but he says he is
<br>
completely off the grid and running at sufficient efficiency to only need a
<br>
water tank refilled about every 6-8 months.  He is working on power
<br>
generation, but due to funding and light considerations (he lives in
<br>
Indiana), he hasn't been so succesfull.  He's learned a bit about the
<br>
systems by enduring a crash or two, but he's humming right along now.  I can
<br>
email him for more specifics, if you want.  He also is researching the
<br>
implementation of CELSS work in colonies by testing out his own system.  He
<br>
gets pretty in-depth, using sensors and such to test chemical concentrations
<br>
of the system.  He grows a bit of his own food, as well
