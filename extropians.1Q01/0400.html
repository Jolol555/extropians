</em><br>
<p>I agree, this talk of how &quot;one mistake with nanotechnology will
<br>
wipe us out&quot; ignores the wide variety of implementations and design
<br>
approaches which will fall under the general category of nanotech.
<br>
Nanotech encompasses a very broad range of manufacturing technologies.
<br>
What they have in common is that they are working precisely at the
<br>
atomic or molecular scale.  Within that scheme there are millions of
<br>
possible approaches.
<br>
<p>Drexler emphasizes that the pick-and-place robotic arm which many people
<br>
view as the canonical approach to nanotech manufacturing is actually
<br>
likely to play a very small role.  Far greater efficiency will result from
<br>
specialized equipment which makes specific products.  Nanotech &quot;assembly
<br>
lines&quot; can perform repeated operations to raw materials carried along
<br>
conveyor belts and transportation pallets.  The entire work flow will
<br>
be optimally structured for whatever product the factory is producing.
<br>
<p>You could have a nanotech factory that just made micro-scale gears,
<br>
for example.  If that factory makes a mistake, it's not going to wipe
<br>
us out, it's just going to make some bad gears.  And similarly for all
<br>
the other kinds of products we will need in a nanotech world.
<br>
<p>Not only is such a manufacturing methodology more efficient, it is likely
<br>
to be far easier to design than some kind of general-purpose eat-anything,
<br>
build-anything magical genie machine.  Furthermore it integrates into
<br>
the existing economy more easily and allows incremental development of
<br>
new products.
<br>
<p>In such a nanotech world, there is no way that one mistake is going
<br>
to wipe all of us out.  Yes, there will be dangerous products, just as
<br>
there are today.  But they don't destroy the world.
<br>
<p>Now, of course we can imagine the design of products which could,
<br>
potentially destroy the world - omnivorous (or biovorous as Robert Freitas
<br>
describes it) gray goo replicators.  This is a problem recognized since
<br>
the earliest days, and one we have debated many times.  At a minimum,
<br>
it is clear that the design of such dangerous devices is not going to
<br>
be easy and will require a long-term, intense effort.
<br>
<p>I don't think it is fair to associate the entire field of nanotechnology
<br>
with the dangers posed by this specific problem.  It's something that
<br>
we have to watch out for, yes.  But there is far more to nanotech than
<br>
gray goo devices.
