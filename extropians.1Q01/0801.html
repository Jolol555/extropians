This article originally appeared in the Asian Wall Street Journal, and was 
<br>
in the US version on Monday, Jan 8.  Generally, it's an interesting piece on 
<br>
future plans for high-density living in Asia.  I think the &quot;Hyper Building&quot; 
<br>
sounds pretty cool; an all-in-one affair along the lines of what was 
<br>
mentioned in the recent Soleri thread.
<br>
<p>Also, it's exciting to know about the four planned projects which will stand 
<br>
taller than the current skyscraper world champion, the Petronas Towers in 
<br>
Kuala Lumpur.  I visited the Petronas Towers in August; what a stunningly 
<br>
attractive set of buildings.
<br>
<p>If the &quot;1,914-foot multi-use megalith&quot; planned for Kowloon actually gets 
<br>
built, it will be a while before any other superscrapers pass it up.
<br>
<p><p>Asian Cities Seek Ways to Boost
<br>
Density by Raising Height Limits
<br>
By JOHN KRICH
<br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
<br>
<p><p>With its tightly clustered apartment turrets and overrun sidewalks, Hong 
<br>
Kong's ultra-dense layout was once viewed as an Asian anomaly: a 
<br>
migrant-driven experiment in stacked humanity that was every city planner's 
<br>
nightmare.
<br>
<p>But in the past few years, many of those same planners have come to view 
<br>
Hong Kong's crowded skyline as something quite different: a model for the 
<br>
future Asian city.
<br>
<p>&quot;Everyone is now taking a new look at Hong Kong,&quot; says Kim Kiho, Dean of 
<br>
Planning and Development at the University of Seoul .
<br>
<p>That Hong Kong should now be considered in vogue is an indication of the 
<br>
dramatic scenario facing Asian cities. By 2025, today's 1.1 billion 
<br>
inhabitants of the East's metropoli will become 2.5 billion, according to 
<br>
the Asian Development Bank, an increase greater than the entire present-day 
<br>
populace of China. In 25 years, that nation alone will have 100 
<br>
municipalities of over two million souls; New Delhi will top 20 million, 
<br>
Jakarta 30 million.
<br>
<p>Bangkok, where traffic currently averages six kilometers an hour, will have 
<br>
to accommodate twice as many cars. Tokyo, where the standard daily commute 
<br>
is already 138 minutes, could have twice as much urban sprawl. And cities 
<br>
across the region will be struggling with an acute increase in air 
<br>
pollution, diminished water resources and, most importantly, shrinking 
<br>
agricultural land.
<br>
<p>&quot;In our time,&quot; declares Sumet Jumsai, one of Thai-land's leading architects 
<br>
and futurists, &quot;Asia-Pacific must challenge the implied apocalypse.&quot;
<br>
<p>To meet that challenge, planners across the region are now discussing how 
<br>
they can dramatically increase urban density by raising height limits and 
<br>
upping the crucial &quot;plot ratios' that determine how much living space can be 
<br>
crammed onto each parcel of land. And no place has been able to do that 
<br>
better than Hong Kong.
<br>
<p>Oddly, that has now turned the former colony into something of a showpiece. 
<br>
Hong Kong University's Department of Architecture hosted a Megacities 2000 
<br>
Conference last February at which experts from Shanghai, Tokyo and Sao Paulo 
<br>
applauded presentations like &quot;A Paradigm Shift for High-Density Development 
<br>
Proposing A Vertical Reinterpretation of the Traditional Horizontal City.&quot; 
<br>
Architects, academics and officials examined visionary schemes like 
<br>
climate-controlled &quot;bubble cities&quot; and the mundane world of Hong Kong's 
<br>
waste management, all in an effort to better figure out how to find more 
<br>
civilized ways to fit more people into a smaller space.
<br>
<p>&quot;Conditions differ from city to city and we would never tell anyone else 
<br>
what to do,&quot; says Bosco Fung, the head of the Hong Kong government's Land 
<br>
and Planning Bureau. But he and others are quick to point out links between 
<br>
Hong Kong's vertical expansion and its economic prosperity. Few Asian cities 
<br>
can compete with its relatively uncrowded highways, streamlined pedestrian 
<br>
flows between offices or modern and effective housing, for example. &quot;We 
<br>
don't do this by choice,&quot; says Mr. Fung, &quot;but we think high-density living 
<br>
has its advantages -- in terms of cost-effective infrastructure, energy and 
<br>
transport.&quot;
<br>
<p>Asia's cities have managed rapid growth and massive population shifts in the 
<br>
past. Hong Kong's population, estimated at 700,000 in 1948, had tripled by 
<br>
1952 with the influx of refugees from China, and now stands at just over six 
<br>
million.
<br>
<p>Cities like Manila, Tokyo and Seoul were virtually rebuilt from scratch 
<br>
after war damage. But now, another wave of industrialization and 
<br>
globalization is set to lure an unprecedented number of people into the 
<br>
cities.
<br>
<p>The Great Sardine Cans of the World.
<br>
<p>While Asia is already home to nine of the 10 most people-crammed 
<br>
environments in the world, planners are worried that if they don't actively 
<br>
promote density, there could be dire consequences. Unchecked sprawl in 
<br>
China's Guandong province, for instance, is consuming 265 hectares of 
<br>
farmland a year. And the further a city sprawls the less efficient its 
<br>
energy and water use become.
<br>
<p>In order to keep sprawl at bay, planners across the region are taking up 
<br>
some ambitious, even far-fetched schemes. In Tokyo, there is talk of 
<br>
building sky-links between the upper floors of the towers in the central 
<br>
Shinjuku district.
<br>
<p>In Singapore, a paragon of planning and a self-proclaimed &quot;garden city,&quot; the 
<br>
just-released report of a blue-ribbon panel on the city's central plan reads 
<br>
like a near-capitulation to the values of its civic competitor, Hong Kong. 
<br>
The report's goal is to adopt &quot;compact city principles that promote 
<br>
high-density.&quot; It suggests increasing plot ratios by four times and 
<br>
injecting &quot;Manhattan-style housing into the New Downtown.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kuala Lumpur's 452-meter-high Petronas Towers, the world's tallest building, 
<br>
is about to lose its top spot. Under construction at the moment are Pusan's 
<br>
Lotte World, at 107 floors and 464.5 meters, and the Taipei Financial 
<br>
Center, slated to hit 508 meters, spire included. The Shanghai Financial 
<br>
Center will crest at 480 meters, and Hong Kong has approved plans for a 
<br>
580-meter multi-use megalith on its Kowloon peninsula.
<br>
<p>But as cities reach skyward, it is unclear whether any place will be able to 
<br>
replicate Hong Kong's compactness, or, more importantly, whether anyone 
<br>
should even want to.
<br>
<p>Hong Kong's intense density came about more by accident than design. It's 
<br>
tightly packed neighborhoods are the unwitting result of rapid growth, 
<br>
restricted usable land and policies aimed at protecting green belts while 
<br>
sustaining high property values. Technically, the city doesn't even have 
<br>
height limits. Contractors put up 40-story apartment buildings on plots the 
<br>
size of postage stamps, constrained only by the potential return on their 
<br>
investment.
<br>
<p>Charlie Xue, a lecturer in building design at Hong Kong City University, 
<br>
calls it &quot;the ultimate expression of the commercial spirit, with every site 
<br>
filled to 100% of its boundaries.&quot; But he also has doubts about how 
<br>
habitable some of the city's most crowded areas are.
<br>
<p>At 116,000 people per square kilometer, the Mongkok neighborhood on the 
<br>
Kowloon peninsula has been termed the most dense spot on earth. The area's 
<br>
aging housing stock, draped with drying laundry, resembles a giant prison 
<br>
barracks. The welter of neon signs blots out the sky. Evening shoppers 
<br>
resemble a herd in a pen; mothers and children wear matching masks of 
<br>
particulate-blocking kerchiefs. Mr. Xue conducted a study that found not one 
<br>
public place to sit down along the 20 blocks of Mongkok's main thoroughfare.
<br>
<p>On a recent stroll through the area, Mr. Xue, a Shanghai native accustomed 
<br>
to mob scenes, shakes his head in disbelief as he points out a single, 
<br>
semi-landscaped lot between the flat concrete flanks of office towers -- 
<br>
Mongkok's only &quot;pocket park.&quot; He compliments the city government on turning 
<br>
several blocks of a major shopping street into pedestrian malls, an obvious 
<br>
attempt at crowd relief that still bears signs calling it a &quot;trial run.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet critics like Mr. Xue concede that residents seem largely unfazed by the 
<br>
conditions. He recently conducted a survey of Mongkok's denizens, many of 
<br>
whom are elderly, and turned up few complaints. Mr. Fung, of the Hong Kong 
<br>
government, explains that locals have adapted to a situation that outsiders 
<br>
might see as unlivable. &quot;If people don't want to live in high-rises, they 
<br>
won't. They will vandalize and destroy their buildings, as they did in 
<br>
Europe,&quot; says Mr. Fung.
<br>
<p>Some wonder whether others could endure the close-quarter living that many 
<br>
in Hong Kong take for granted. C.W. Ho, an architecture professor at Hong 
<br>
Kong University, says that the noise, health risks and lack of privacy could 
<br>
only be borne by a stoic, passive people like those in Hong Kong -- who, in 
<br>
his words, &quot;weren't considered human by the British.&quot; He calls Hong Kong's 
<br>
density levels &quot;unnecessary and inhuman, a high price for the populace to 
<br>
pay.&quot;
<br>
<p>A study-in-progress by Professor Mee Kam Ng of Hong Kong University's Centre 
<br>
of Urban Planning highlights the lack of community spaces and meeting halls 
<br>
in the commercialized hyper-dense areas. Ms. Ng's preliminary research 
<br>
indicates that as neighbor-hoods become more dense, the level of community 
<br>
often diminishes.
<br>
<p>But density advocates argue that the formula can work if it is carried out 
<br>
correctly. Anthony Yeh, also a professor at the Centre of Urban Planning, 
<br>
draws a distinction between the grim statistics and a reality in which 
<br>
people draw strength from the convenience of life in tight spaces. &quot;Density 
<br>
is a physical condition, while crowding is a psychological experience,&quot; he 
<br>
says. Hong Kong's relatively low rate of violent crime and social unrest, he 
<br>
argues, show that the benefits of extreme urbanization can outweigh the 
<br>
costs.
<br>
<p>Others believe that well-planned density can be more than just efficient, 
<br>
but will create entirely new forms of urban community. Hitoshi Aoki, an 
<br>
official at Tokyo's Department of Urban Development, feels that it is Asia's 
<br>
mission to fulfill the dreams of Frank Lloyd Wright and Paolo Soleri to 
<br>
perfect density on a vast, utopian scale. This mild-mannered, vest-wearing, 
<br>
wavy-haired bureaucrat turns downright messianic when discussing the merits 
<br>
of density.
<br>
<p>For a decade, Mr. Aoki has been advocating a grandiose project called the 
<br>
Hyper Building. In various blueprints drafted by well-known architects, the 
<br>
Hyper Building is a 1,000-meter-high structure meant to house all the 
<br>
functions of a city of 200,000. It would provide 1,000 hectares of usable 
<br>
space on a very small footprint and would be engineered to last 1,000 years 
<br>
-- a reference to ancient Japan's most long-lived building, the great temple 
<br>
at Nara.
<br>
<p>When it was first proposed in 1990, the Hyper Building was thought of as 
<br>
little more than a sci-fi fantasy. But as urban living in Tokyo has become 
<br>
more unmanageable, the project has moved from the drawing board to the 
<br>
planning committee. Government seed money and funding from 90 corporations 
<br>
support the Hyper Building Research Organization.
<br>
<p>Mr. Aoki supervises 350 experts, divided into 13 subcommittees, charged with 
<br>
calculating all aspects of the vast, ever-changing platforms in the sky that 
<br>
would, in his words, &quot;create an interactive community with its own immune 
<br>
system, that circulates fresh air, limits waste and water usage, offers 
<br>
total security, automated mail and goods delivery -- and untouched forest an 
<br>
elevator ride away.&quot;
<br>
<p>The project is now being considered for Japan's new capital -- which could 
<br>
be transferred from Tokyo to a rural area by 2010. It comes with a price tag 
<br>
of 25 trillion yen ($200 billion). But Mr. Aoki insists that is a bargain: 
<br>
&quot;A conventional settlement with the same number of people would cost 70 
<br>
trillion [yen].&quot;
<br>
<p>City living in such high-tech castles would make Hong Kong feel like a 
<br>
stroll in the woods. Still, as Hong Kong must add housing for 150,000 people 
<br>
every year, Mr. Fung, of the city's Land and Planning Bureau, admits, &quot;Who 
<br>
knows? We might see a Hyper Structure in the New Territories one day.&quot;
<br>
<p>Says Tokyo's Mr. Aoki ominously: &quot;The truth is that Asia's cities don't have 
<br>
any real density yet.&quot;
