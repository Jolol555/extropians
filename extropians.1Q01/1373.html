</em><br>
<p>Also, effects that some folks on this list can contemplate with
<br>
equanimity
<br>
are events that would horrify many people outside of extreme
<br>
sci-fi/technophilic
<br>
circles.  For example, Eliezer Yudkowsky has said on many occasions
<br>
that,
<br>
as long as the human race survives long enough to give birth to some
<br>
sort
<br>
of superintelligence, the ultimate fate of humanity is of no consequence
<br>
(to him or, presumably, in the ultimate scheme of things).  I suspect
<br>
that this
<br>
attitude is part of what gives folks like Bill Joy the willies.
<br>
<p>When I heard Ray Kurzweil speak at the PC Expo last summer, he showed
<br>
transparencies
<br>
of various graphs he had prepared of historical data, which he claimed
<br>
showed
<br>
that progress on various fronts is exponential.  One of these graphs was
<br>
of
<br>
economic data, in which (as Kurzweil pointed out) the Great Depression
<br>
was
<br>
a visible glitch, but one which was more than made up for by the surge
<br>
in
<br>
economic growth which took place after its end.  It crossed my mind then
<br>
that,
<br>
if the evolution of post-human intelligence involves the extermination
<br>
of most
<br>
or all of the human race (as in the scenarios of Hugo de Garis or Kevin
<br>
Warwick),
<br>
a retrospective Kurzweil graph of the event might still show it as a
<br>
barely-visible
<br>
glitch in the exponential curve -- if the Singularitarians are right, 
<br>
the
<br>
sheer computational capacity of the entities swarming through the solar
<br>
system
<br>
a few years after the extinction of humanity might be such that to them,
<br>
the
<br>
loss of several billion human brains' worth of processing capacity might
<br>
be no
<br>
more than the ongoing quota of traffic fatalities that the human race
<br>
(or the
<br>
industrialized part of it) is willing to bear as the price of having
<br>
cars.  Or maybe
<br>
even less -- no more than the unnoticed and unmourned loss of a few
<br>
cells from an
<br>
individual human being.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From an individual's perspective, the Great Depression was a period of
</em><br>
almost unimaginable suffering, as would de Garis' Cosmist-vs-Terran
<br>
war (either between pro- and anti-AI humans, or between humans and AIs).
<br>
Many mainstream people would say that anybody who can contemplate such
<br>
an
<br>
event with detachment must be a bit of a monster.  Be that as it may,
<br>
it may prove to be an unbridgeable gulf between Singularitarians
<br>
and the rest of humanity (even technologically sophisticated folks like
<br>
Bill
<br>
Joy), if the former are seen as taking a cold-blooded,
<br>
&quot;che sera, sera&quot; attitude toward the possibility of the extinction of
<br>
the
<br>
human race.  I think the motives of enthusiastic Singularitarians are
<br>
always going to be mistrusted by the mainstream, and Extropians and
<br>
Singularitarians are likely to continue to be portrayed by journalists
<br>
and
<br>
authors as they are, for instance, in Ken Macleod's _The Cassini
<br>
Division_.
