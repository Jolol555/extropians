</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Warning! Warning!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, most gun magazines exist, like most car magazines, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sell copies of themselves and thus to sell advertising. No matter how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledgeable a single author sounds, do not swallow any &quot;party line&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole. Be skeptical. Keep learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If stopping power is what you are interested, dropping a perp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immediately with little chance of him continuing an assault, then you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to use a larger caliber pistol round, from 9mm, .40, .45 ACP, .45
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Special, .45 Long Colt, .44 magnum, .454 Casull, or .480 Ruger. Hollow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point ammo, especially +P powered hollow point like Cor-Bon is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effective in stopping a perp, but oddly enough less likely to kill them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from wounds than a small caliber like .22 (because they don't go into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shock as easily from smaller calibers, they bleed easier).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Umm. Well. *Ahem*. The Marshall and Sanow notion of the ultrafast light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projectile in larger calibers sure seems to sell a lot of magazines.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with ultrafast is penetration. Ball penetrates the most, and
<br>
is most likely to hurt someone else, while hollow points 'star' out and
<br>
transfer more energy to the first target hit, are less likely to go
<br>
completely through a large target, etc. The higher velocity a projectile
<br>
carries the more likely it is to pass through the target, which is why
<br>
there is something to be  said for .45 ACP, which is heavy and subsonic,
<br>
and while it stops perps well it is statistically less likely to kill.
<br>
<p>The only ultrafast thats really effective are high velocities as seen
<br>
with .223 type or higher hollow point rounds where the bullet almost
<br>
completely disintegrates. Of course, they don't make pistols for such
<br>
rounds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point, 9mm and .40 Liberty are the primary self defense calibers, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; .45 ACP and .44 magnum close behind. .454 Casull is a powerhouse round
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that only a well built man over 6 feet can really handle with ease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, if concealability is your thing, then you could look at a .25, .32,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or .357 caliber gun. SeeCamp, and some clone companies make some decent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very compact .32 caliber autoloaders that fit in the pocket of one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; khakis with little or no 'printing' or sag.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With smaller calibers, placing shots properly is even more important.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, however, since most all self defense situations take place at less
<br>
than 10 yards range, its not primarily important, of course, I've seen
<br>
police videos of cops emptying entire mags at that range without hitting
<br>
the suspect, so dealing with stress while shooting is a big factor that
<br>
all the range time in the world won't help. Smaller caliber guns are
<br>
generally used for 'up the nose' ranges, in any event.
