<p>
<em> &gt; Thats more than the entire value of many countries
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (likely greater than the value of Herr Bider's home
</em><br>
<em> &gt; country of Slovenia). How would you like it if a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; neighbor, say, Italy, had a communist government
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and decided to confiscate the entire country of Slovenia
</em><br>
<p>For the record - our country drafts all young men for 6 months in the army
<br>
once they're done with their education. This means you get to shoot around
<br>
as much as you want, but only when you're old enough, and by being put in
<br>
the proper perspective - a perspective of war.
<br>
<p>If Italy was to march upon us, every active male between 18 and 45 would get
<br>
a gun and would be ordered to fight. Which is a concept I pretty much
<br>
dislike, because I think a professional army could do the same thing just as
<br>
well, if not better. After all, we're too small to defend against any
<br>
serious invasion - like Italy, perhaps - if we don't get external help.
<br>
<p>Myself, if there was a war, I would prefer to find myself another place to
<br>
live, if at all possible. My fortune is my mind, not my land. If people are
<br>
childish enough to want to play command-and-conquer in real-blood-mode,
<br>
well, I'd prefer not to be anywhere in sight.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; Of course, a government that thinks it can tell a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; $100+ billion company like Microsoft how to run its
</em><br>
<em> &gt; business is only a hairs breadth from doing just that...
</em><br>
<p>A-haa, lookie lookie, now I can see where you're coming from.
<br>
<p>Believe it or not, I can hardly wait for Microsoft to be broken up, and I
<br>
totally agree with the findings of that fine Thomas Penfield Jackson.
<br>
Namely, his findings about the nature of Gates' and Microsoft's customary
<br>
habits when it comes to doing business. Not that I don't like Bill, he's a
<br>
great guy and I sympathise with him very much. I think he's a good person
<br>
overall. But what he is doing is fundamentally bad.
<br>
<p>So it seems we disagree on the very basics of it all. I like liberty, and I
<br>
like rights, but I also believe in society. We can't go to Mars if we don't
<br>
cooperate. We can't possibly ever visit Alpha Centauri if we kill each other
<br>
off. The sad fact is, giving people too much rights enables some of them,
<br>
like that Mr Gates over there, or that Mr Case over on the other side, to
<br>
get their hands at more power than they can manage. And that causes grief
<br>
and suffering for everyone else.
<br>
<p>The fact is, society works much better if it trusts itself. Which,
<br>
essentially, means that you have to trust your government, too. Not blindly
<br>
or naively, but - trust in principle, distrust on specifics. But the way
<br>
many people seem to be doing it is distrust in principle, trust in
<br>
specifics. If that attitude prevails, no honest person wants to work in the
<br>
government, and you sooner or later find yourself with a really crooked
<br>
government that you really can't trust.
<br>
<p>And I'm raving, and I definitely need to go to bed. :-(
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>- denis
