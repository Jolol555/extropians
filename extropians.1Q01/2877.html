<p>You've lost me. The article was based on conditions in the USA. If it were 
<br>
about other countries, especially ones that clearly affected me, I would be 
<br>
concerned too.
<br>
<p>Why would you think libertarians should be utterly unconcerned with 
<br>
people's education and skills? We're not all heartless SOBs you know. 
<br>
Besides, on a purely selfish and pragmatic basis it matters a great deal to 
<br>
me that people are skilled enough to power the economy forward. Who do you 
<br>
think are going to create all those technological and scientific 
<br>
breakthroughs? (I'd add: without better critical and creative thinking 
<br>
skills, who is going to understand the possibilities and adapt their 
<br>
thinking to them?)
<br>
<p>Onward!
