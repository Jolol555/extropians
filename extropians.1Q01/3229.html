There's also a PR on the aclu site--but it's less interesting. The 
<br>
facts as alleged by the aclu are presented in the article I sourced--
<br>
along with some additional perspectives not included on the aclu 
<br>
site. The character of the LA Weekly thus becomes largely irrelevant, 
<br>
and in fact I was wondering what sort of comments might arise which 
<br>
were unrelated to the story itself.
<br>
<p>Go read this instead:
<br>
<p><a href="http://aclu.org/news/2000/n081600b.html">http://aclu.org/news/2000/n081600b.html</a>
<br>
<p>You'll be happier.
<br>
<p>I tell you this, however: Police trained in the use of &quot;less-than-
<br>
lethal&quot; weapons are specifically warned that aiming at the head with 
<br>
baton, flashlight, rubber bullets, whatever--IS DEADLY FORCE.
<br>
<p>If you see nothing wrong with police deliberately 
<br>
intimidating/attacking journalists and seizing/destroying the 
<br>
evidence thereof, well--perhaps you'd find eastern Europe to your 
<br>
liking...

<p><em>&gt; I read your post and what you quoted and thought, &quot;Wow, that sounds

<em>&gt; The whole time I was reading the article, I was wondering about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation of the police officers.  Did a riot seem imminent?  Had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officers been injured?  Was there some type of perceived threat to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent bystanders or public property?  Unfortunately, the article 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't cover the police perspective except for one little quote from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a police spokesperson.  Instead of providing any real information 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the event that might have given a discerning reader a full 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture of what happened, the article seemed only to pander to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typical anti-police sentiment in the worst one-sided way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if you take all of the complaints as true - a dubious decision 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at best - the worst things that happened were that a woman was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knocked down and cut her knee, and a guy lost his camera.  If that's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all that happened and a serious riot was prevented, I say, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Congratulations to the LAPD&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm curious.  How can you read such an obviously one-sided article 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and reference it here as though it validates your argument?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such a wonderful news site, that laweekly.com.  A real paragon of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journalism.  Here's a little teaser from another article they're 
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;America may want to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;badly Stupid George

<em>&gt; &gt;You wanna practice full disclosure? Here's what happened to the likes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of David Horowitz, NBC, ABC, AP, etc.--in full view of one another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What do you think would happen to YOU, alone, on a lonesome road (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;crowded freeway, for that matter)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Your intentions may be good--but you know where that road leads...

<em>&gt; &gt;As one photog put it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;“There’s clear time on both sides to recognize who we are, who the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;police are and who the press is. And you know, we are supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have a white flag,” Crespo said. “I was in Kosovo last year, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;know, and I didn’t get shot there. I got shot in Los Angeles.”
