<p>I liked your answer too.

<p>I can understand your disappointment. I would have been very disappointed if
<br>
it had turned out to be some sort of hypercube. Posing problems in &gt;3
<br>
spacial dimensions doesn't *seem* fair.
<br>
<p>It really stems from your expectations of what a puzzle should be. Had the
<br>
puzzle been posted in alt.maths.topology a hyperspacial solution would have
<br>
been more appropriate.
<br>
<p>I see from your own stab at the puzzle you took a very literary angle. This
<br>
is hardly surprising considering you're an author.
<br>
<p>I think the point of Eliezer's puzzle was to challenge our assumptions and
<br>
force us to think outside the box ('box' probably being another clue). The
<br>
box this time being the *form* of the riddle-answer pair.
<br>
<p>You assumed it would have an answer like every other, probably of the
<br>
juxtaposition-of-letters form. Personally I never really enjoyed those
<br>
types, I find them disappointing and inadequate. Sound familiar?
<br>
<p>Trying to design a machine that can think outside these solution patterns is
<br>
a central issue to real AI. Existing attempts at AI are notoriously brittle,
<br>
and suffer from inflexibility due to rigid classification schemes.
<br>
<p>The only reason I solved it was because I've seen this meta-pattern before,
<br>
and it's no coincidence I also work on AI as Eli' does. Having half a dozen
<br>
goes helps too! :)
<br>
<p>Have a go at the puzzle I posted. If it makes you feel any better (and at
<br>
the risk of spoiling it) I guarantee it has a spacial answer, although it
<br>
might still challenge your assumptions.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
