**Responses to two posts here; trying to cut back on
<br>
number of my own. Or is this not necessary? (No
<br>
sarcastic replies, please! Or does saying this

guarantee I'll get them??)

<p>**But, okay—bad example. A very well-put post.

<p><p><em>&gt;My current thinking is that modeling the human limbic

system is important in order for any AP to understand
<br>
humans. There is some risk of creating an emotionally
<br>
unbalanced AP. The same is true of people today. We
<br>
need to do a better job of raising APs than we do of
<br>
raising many kids if those APs are going to be
<br>
trustworthy. If they are able to go SI, it's even more
<br>
important. 
<br>
<p>**Why model it? We already have one. As the emotional
<br>
issues remain, and the issue of “raising” the thing as
<br>
well—why not simply elevate ourselves, rather than
<br>
create an (for al practical purposes) alien
<br>
intelligence?
<br>
<p>**Or do you see this as perhaps a part of the scenario
<br>
you’re painting?
<br>
<p><p>**Now to the other post…

<p><em>&gt;Tell you what, you stop saying it and I'll stop

<br>
<p><p>&amp;#61656; &gt; Yes; precisely. My read on, for instance,
<br>
Drexler's &gt; active shield concept is that we hand over
<br>
<em>&gt; peacekeeping tasks to an AI which is equipped with &gt;
</em><br>
weapons superior to all others. Like me, you appear to
<br>
not always re-read what you write. Yes, you say &quot;my
<br>
read&quot;, but consider what you say after that. When you
<br>
call it &quot;_Drexler's_ active shield concept&quot;, you imply
<br>
that he wrote in this wise. If it wasn't in _EoC_ that
<br>
he said it, where was it? If you meant something more
<br>
like &quot;my extrapolation of how a widely distributed
<br>
immune system modeled after Drexler's active shield
<br>
concept, implemented under central control ('_an
<br>
AI_')...&quot;, you could have said so. If you didn't mean
<br>
that, perhaps I misunderstood. But on my reading of
<br>
what you actually wrote: you are indicating Drexler
<br>
thinks what you do. &quot;My read on &lt;Person&gt;'s &lt;x&gt;&quot; means,
<br>
generally, &quot;My interpretation of what &lt;Person&gt;
<br>
says/intends&quot;. Does it not? BTW, where I come from,
<br>
&quot;my take&quot; is different from &quot;my read&quot;. (Do I HAVE to
<br>
re-read all your posts? No, I can use search tools.
<br>
Just as you ought to be able to. Class, for your
<br>
exercise, find a machine-readable copy of _EoC_ on the
<br>
Web, download the relevant chapters if necessary, and
<br>
use automated string search for &quot;active&quot; and
<br>
&quot;shield&quot;...)

<p><p><p>**Here we have Mr. D. saying what I said he said (as
<br>
opposed to what it’s been said I said he
<br>
said)—AI-controlled active shields with (obviously)
<br>
weapons which are by his description (though not
<br>
outright statement) superior to all others. If the
<br>
weapons under its/their control are NOT superior to
<br>
all others, the concept is useless; thus I suggest
<br>
this is clearly his meaning/intent/and so on. Note
<br>
that in the snippet of my post which has been quoted,
<br>
I did not refer to a single global AI controlling all
<br>
shields, though admittedly I tend to think in those
<br>
terms. (Multiple AIs might be a safer bet—and might
<br>
not be.)
<br>
<p>Drexler, EoC, Chapter 11:
<br>
<p>“With such systems we may be able to explore the
<br>
limits of the possible well enough to build a reliable
<br>
shield against all physically possible threats…. 
<br>
<p><p>“In building active shields, we will be able to use
<br>
the power of replicators and AI systems to multiply
<br>
the traditional advantages of the defending force: we
<br>
can give it overwhelming strength through abundant,
<br>
replicator-built hardware with designs based on the
<br>
equivalent of a million-year lead in technology.”
<br>
<p>Drexler, EoC, Chapter 12:
<br>
<p>“Consider a space-based example. We now can design
<br>
devices that sense (looks like a thousand missiles
<br>
have just been launched), assess (this looks like an
<br>
attempted first strike) and act (try to destroy those
<br>
missiles!). If a system will fire only at massive
<br>
flights of missiles, then it cannot be used for
<br>
offense or a space blockade. Better yet, it could be
<br>
made incapable of discriminating between attacking
<br>
sides….
<br>
<p>“By defending both sides while threatening neither,
<br>
active shields could weaken the cycle of the arms
<br>
race.” 
<br>
<p>**He goes on at length about AI/nanocomputing as
<br>
relates to active shields.
<br>
<p>**My ‘have to read’ EoC again’ Q was a kind of
<br>
editorial comment, if you will.
