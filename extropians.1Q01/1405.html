<em>&gt; &gt;From an individual's perspective, the Great Depression was a period of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; war (either between pro- and anti-AI humans, or between humans and AIs).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many mainstream people would say that anybody who can contemplate such

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joy), if the former are seen as taking a cold-blooded,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;che sera, sera&quot; attitude toward the possibility of the extinction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human race.
</em><br>
<p>Lest we forget, the pattern of introduction of new technologies is that
<br>
they rarely destroy an existing one; they simply relegate it to a niche,
<br>
so that the resulting society is more complex, not less. (The moving picture
<br>
didn't destroy the theatre, although it downsized it. Television didn't
<br>
destroy the movies. The internet hasn't destroyed television. And so on.)
<br>
<p>I'd actually be somewhat surprised and offended if someone began espousing
<br>
a singularitarian position that _requires_ the human species to get out
<br>
of the way in the name of progress. (As opposed to politely offering to
<br>
coexist in a non-coercive manner.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the motives of enthusiastic Singularitarians are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always going to be mistrusted by the mainstream, and Extropians and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarians are likely to continue to be portrayed by journalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authors as they are, for instance, in Ken Macleod's _The Cassini
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Division_.
</em><br>
<p>Bzzt: Ken's take on things is not that simplistic. (I hope you aren't
<br>
reading Cassini Division in isolation, rather than as book #3 in a four-
<br>
book set.)
