<p>
Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
<br>
A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your
<br>
ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is
<br>
two to one, etc.
<br>
<p>Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life.
<br>
Is this true?
<br>
<p>A: How could that be true? Your heart is only
<br>
good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything wears out
<br>
eventually, so how could speeding up your heart make
<br>
you live longer? That's like saying you can extend the life
<br>
of your car by driving it more. Want to live longer? Take a
<br>
nap.
<br>
<p>Q: My wife/girlfriend says I should cut down on meat and
<br>
eat more fruits and vegetables.
<br>
<p>A: Your wife just doesn't grasp logistical efficiencies the
<br>
way you do. Look, what does a cow eat? Corn. And what's
<br>
corn? A vegetable. So a steak is nothing more than an
<br>
efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your
<br>
system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good
<br>
source of field grass. And a pork chop can give you
<br>
100% of your recommended daily allowance of slop.
<br>
<p>Q: Is beer bad for you?
<br>
<p>A: I normally don't like to answer questions which deal with
<br>
my religious values, but I find this question so ridiculous
<br>
I simply have to say something. Look, it goes to the earlier
<br>
point about vegetables. As we all know, scientists divide
<br>
everything in the world into three categories:  animal,
<br>
mineral, and vegetable. We all know beer is not an animal,
<br>
and it's not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
<br>
leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a
<br>
beer and tell everyone you're on a vegetarian diet.
<br>
<p>Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to &quot;spot&quot; for him while he
<br>
did the bench press. What did he mean?
<br>
<p>A: &quot;Spotting&quot; for someone means you stand over him
<br>
while he blows air up your shorts. It's an accepted
<br>
practice at health clubs, though if you find that it becomes
<br>
the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought
<br>
to reevaluate your exercise program.
<br>
<p>Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a
<br>
regular exercise program?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.
<br>
<p>Q: I'm getting a little soft around the middle. Will sit-ups
<br>
help this?
<br>
<p>A: Definitely not! Look, when you exercise a
<br>
muscle, it gets bigger, right? You should only be doing
<br>
sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach
<br>
<p>Q: I thought it would be good for me to carry my clubs
<br>
when I play golf, but last weekend some idiot almost ran
<br>
over me with the golf cart!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;A: Sorry. I was reaching into my cooler and didn't see
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>Q: There's a lot of equipment available at the gym today,
<br>
like the treadmill, the stair-stepper, etc. Which one do you
<br>
recommend?
<br>
&nbsp;A: The strato-lounger
