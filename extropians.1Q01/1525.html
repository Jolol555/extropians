<p>I'm a bit more optimistic.
<br>
<p>I'm noticing a higher density than normal of &gt;H themes in local media,
<br>
particularly around issues of aging/conquering aging. It shouldn't be a
<br>
surprise I guess, because it's an issue close to all of us, and now it looks
<br>
like some newsworthy things are happening in that area.
<br>
<p>The most interesting turn up for the books is the increasing amount of
<br>
people I know who are becoming pro-life extension. A couple of years ago,
<br>
most people I talked to would dismiss it as irresponsible (you know the
<br>
population arguments), foolish, and being overly-impressed by science
<br>
fiction; basicly, enormously unlikely and bespeaking suspicious morality.
<br>
<p>Now I'm noticing a slow change in attitude, particularly from the older
<br>
people that I know. Predictably, these people are starting to notice aging
<br>
approaching; increasing occurences of yucky medical conditions that don't
<br>
happen in their earlier years, friends copping hideous problems like strokes
<br>
&amp; tumors. Suddenly the idea of &quot;aging gracefully&quot; isn't so appealing; aging
<br>
is looking a really bum deal.
<br>
<p>And, they are starting to notice the little messages here and there, about
<br>
biotech, and medical advance; that aging might not be the only option, after
<br>
all...
<br>
<p>Karl Marx, I believe, proposed that morality is driven by physical
<br>
circumstances, not the other way around. I think he's got something there. I
<br>
think people would denounce these ideas as immoral more readily when there
<br>
was not a lot of probability that they would come to anything. Now that
<br>
there is hope on the horizon, morality becomes surprisingly fluid.
<br>
<p>We've got an aging population, and in the west that population is in control
<br>
of a great deal of resources. Life extension is not going to stay on the
<br>
fringe for much longer. And from and beyond that, the rest of the &gt;H/extro
<br>
agenda are comparatively small logical steps.
