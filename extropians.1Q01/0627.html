&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for including the whole paragraph. I should of done it but I didn't
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;want to take too much space. It just happened that what I read (The
<br>
Harvard Classics -P F Collier &amp; son) has his discourse divided as you
<br>
recommend (more power to you!). More than &quot;One Book&quot; references here that
<br>
anybody needs..
<br>
Now if you just can explain the Sartre allusion in a prior entry...

<p>&quot;I still continued, however, to hold in esteem the studies of the schools.

I was aware that the languages taught in them are necessary to the

understanding of the writings of the ancients; that the grace of fable
<br>
stirs the mind; that the memorable deeds of history elevate it; and, if
<br>
read with discretion, aid in forming the judgment; that the perusal of all
<br>
excellent books is,  as it were, to interview with the noblest men of past
<br>
ages, who have written them, and even a studied interview, in which are
<br>
discovered to us only their choicest thoughts; that eloquence has
<br>
incomparable force and beauty; that poesy has its ravishing graces and
<br>
delights; that in the mathematics there are many refined discoveries
<br>
eminently suited to gratify the inquisitive, as well as further all the
<br>
arts an lessen the labour of man; that numerous highly useful precepts and
<br>
exhortations to virtue are contained in treatises on morals; that theology
<br>
points out the path to heaven; that philosophy affords the means of
<br>
discoursing with an appearance of truth on all matters, and commands the
<br>
admiration of the more simple; that jurisprudence, medicine, and the other
<br>
sciences, secure for their cultivators honors and riches; and, in fine,
<br>
that it is useful to bestow some attention upon all, even upon those
<br>
abounding the most in superstition and error, that we may be in a position
<br>
to determine their real value, and guard against being deceived.&quot;
