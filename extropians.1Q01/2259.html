<p>Don't know details, but sounds superficially ok. Any conditions linked to this?

<p>Very ok. Would like to see the details, though. Any conditions?

<p>Huh? Doesn't think it means what is says. (And it doesn't say anything).

<em>&gt; $10,000 over 12 months to support the Odessa Brown Children's Clinic serving

<p>No background whatsoever. 10 k$ in health care means nothing, whether 
<br>
yearly or monthly.

<p>GAAAH. &quot;quality leadership development focused on whole systems change&quot;.
<br>
It can't mean anything good, obviously.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Oh no!!! It's EVIL!!!! Evil I tell you!!!!
</em><br>
<p>The amounts you've cited are negigable. The labels alone doesn't tell much.
<br>
Where's the beef? Where do the biggies go?
<br>

<em>&gt; I'm sorry, but after seeing and hearing the alternatives such as Scott

<p>What you're not getting, is that the state of the world you're seeing is
<br>
nothing what it would have been in absence of the Wintel (+IBM) phenomenon.
<br>
It is really not that hard to get, so give it another try. Go to the lib,
<br>
read stuff from ~1980 and a few good reviews, extrapolate. It's not hard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; they were top dogs.  This nonsense about &quot;damage ... inflicted upon the

<br>
<p><em>&gt; statement about &quot;not seeing the alternative branches which would now exist
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; year 1978&quot; implies some sort of evil conspiracy.  That doesn't make any
</em><br>
<p>Hint: IBM PC project was begun 1978.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; sense.  I posit that had a number of the chief competitors of your evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monsters (IBM/Intel/Microsoft) not reacted so slowly/poorly to the PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon of the late 70's, early 80's then the world WOULD be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different now.  They had their chance and lost.  Microsoft/Intel/IBM was NOT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sure thing back then.
</em><br>
<p>Of course the market is to blame. CP/M was balkanized in regards to disk
<br>
formats, but that was it's only fault. The rest was just marketing &amp; lemmings.
<br>
Blame both.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Most of the programmer types that I know who hate Microsoft generally do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause it's the &quot;cool thing to do.&quot;  Yes, MS has done some despicable things
</em><br>
<p>I don't know, I just use things which suck less. They *still* suck, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in the past and are probably still doing some, but that doesn't make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company evil, and certainly doesn't prove some sort of evil conspiracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories.  Hatred for Microsoft seems to be some sort of religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon in which logic and fact have no place.  *shrug*
</em><br>
<p>I can't do your research for you. In fact I usually don't do the advocacy
<br>
song &amp; dance but in most blatant cases (consider yourself a such). Hence 
<br>
the jingle is more than a bit rusty. There ought to be an anti-Microsoft FAQ.
<br>
Don't feel like researching and writing one.
