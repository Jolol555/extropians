<em>&gt;Subject: Re: Extropy at the State Fair?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;booths of every flavor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why would we want to be presented in a carnival atmosphere like that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because thats where the people are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not to mention the fact that many people will not sit for a dry lecture 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and need to be shown that the future can be fun.
</em><br>

Perhaps there's a middle ground here; rather than being a blatant advert 
<br>
for Extropy or the Institute, why not choose a theme interesting or 
<br>
important to people, but keeping Extropy in the background.  Perhaps 
<br>
alongside whatever literature you would display, you might have 
<br>
some &gt;Human/Extropian material, but discreetly.  Not out and out 
<br>
advertising, but playing on subtle curiosities.  Let them explore the 
<br>
material, and be as helpful as possible.
<br>
<p>That would only leave you with figuring out what topic you would like to 
<br>
present.  Perhaps something in the Science field, but with loads of demos 
<br>
and samples that people can fiddle with and kids will get a kick out 
<br>
of.  Perhaps &quot;Medical advancements throught history&quot;, with old microscopes, 
<br>
a rusty old amputation saw and some modern stuff, yet plotting a future 
<br>
trend to &quot;curing the tragedy of illness&quot; etc...  I'm not sure how these 
<br>
events are arranged or run, or what type of people you get, but I've a 
<br>
feeling the comments about the dislike at being preached to at a fair are 
<br>
probably accurate.  Maybe it would require entertaining people with the 
<br>
idea of advancement, rather than telling them how things will advance.  Or 
<br>
maybe I'm just blowing smoke here:)
<br>
<p>As to what that other themes there could be, I'm afraid I've not got any 
<br>
more ideas right now.  If people find it an interesting idea and I come up 
<br>
with anything, I'll make it known.
<br>
<p>Slan,
<br>
<p><p>James....
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
