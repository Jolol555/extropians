<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think if it's administered under the Hippocratic oath or similar moral and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; admirable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So administering LSD or other drugs to reprogram an incorrigible capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; murderer/serial killer so that they can be rehabilitated would be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acceptable than executing them? When the alternative is execution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; re-programming is a decent alternative.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A HEALTH ISSUE.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly. Execution is a health issue as well, at least as far as the
<br>
condemned person is concerned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Citizens have rights with regards to anyone trying to &quot;reprogram&quot; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But felons are effectively 'non-citizens' in many respects. Until a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; felon is judged fit to return to society, judged to be willing and able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to participate as law abiding citizens, they shouldn't be reintroduced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into that society. Perhaps 'reprogramming' would be acceptable to you if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it were merely a choice a prisoner could make as an alternative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remaining in prison?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You say some felons some are not citizens, do you say they are not human?  I say they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are humans and many citizens.
</em><br>
<p>They are humans, physiologically. Psychologically they may not act as
<br>
humans, primarily because they have not been treated humanely, but there
<br>
are exceptions: Bundy, Dahmer, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reprogramming except in the context of regular education through trade skill and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literary learning and punishments for violent behavior, should not be a focus.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds too cavalier to apply your meat rules to the brains of these prisoners.
</em><br>
<p>Then why do sexual offenders resist accepting treatment as an
<br>
alternative to continued imprisonment after they serve their terms? They
<br>
say they LIKE feeling the way they do about the things they want to do
<br>
to women and children and that they should for some reason have a right
<br>
to continue to feel that way freely on the outside after they serve
<br>
their terms. They want to commit crimes again, they are not
<br>
rehabilitated, and no 'vocational' learning in prison is going to change
<br>
that in any way. I can understand why they resist it. I don't however,
<br>
agree that people who are psychologically predatory on other humans
<br>
should be let loose at some arbitrarily decided point. They should only
<br>
be released when and if they are found competent to act as free,
<br>
law-abiding, and trustworthy citizens. If it takes treatment to make
<br>
them that way, they can choose to take the treatment or stay in prison.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, after valid psychological examination in a psychologically healthy environment, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is determined a mild sedative will help the prisoner cope with his violence issues, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may be prescribed.
</em><br>
<p>How does a sedative help him 'cope'?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this thread I permuted the subject to &quot;No Parole for Federales&quot; to suggest to apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cane to them.
</em><br>
<p>Negative re-enforcement has significant proven deterrent effects. You
<br>
know that kid will never steal a sign in Singapore again, don't you?
