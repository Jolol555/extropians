</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Not true. It simply indicates that I thought Bush was handed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;presidency unfairly. If Gore had won by the same or similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;tactics, I would have made the same comment. My problem is and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;will continue to be the fact that we, the American people, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;been screwed, they did it blatantly, and very few people seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;care about it. I am not a supporter of Gore or the Democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;party, and thought he handled himself poorly. If you see this as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;me being partisan, I guess there's nothing I can do about it. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;obviously have a different definition of the term.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm curious as to what you saw that was unfair about the election.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm really rather tired of this subject, but will mention one thing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which I have personal knowledge: my brother, who lives in Palm Beach
</em><br>
<em>&gt;County and has been voting there for 20 years, noticed something wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with his ballot when he began to use it. He took it up to a poll worker
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(probably a Democrat :-0) to point out the problem and was basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;told &quot;too bad.&quot; This caused him to have to choose between either voting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a candidate other than the one he had intended to vote for, or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having his vote count at all. If this had been an isolated case, I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand it, but it's not. I have since spoken with a number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I know who live in the same county, and have been told similar stories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Add this to the thousands of reported cases of this happening, of votes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being thrown out for various other reasons, of absentee ballots not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being counted or being counted twice, of black voters being turned away
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the polls due to rather suspicious technical snafus, and various
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other problems, and to me we have a highly suspect election.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But this is all irrelevant to the response I made to your original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posting. The only reason I addressed it here is because you brought it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up. My statement about us not really having a president was just me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tossing off a personal opinion, and it was delivered as such. I had no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interest in convincing anyone of my point of view. Besides, there's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lot we can do about it now.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, it doesn't matter; their President is Charleton Heston, anyway (and he IS working out of the White House, according to NRA execs); just check out the bumper stickers on the next old pickup truck you spy parked in front of a house trailer.
