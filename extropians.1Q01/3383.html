<p>Adrian Tymes: all the rage.  ^_^;

<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;And if you wanna breathe you gotta buy his air...&quot;

</em><br>
<p>Nope.  The scenario presumed that the corporation would be the only one
<br>
able to actually access Mars, and thus be the de facto owner of all
<br>
human habitation on Mars.  That includes the breathable air.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Also, keep in mind any earthside government could nuke the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; works with relative impunity--nobody's gonna start a nukewar on earth
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only if they ship up a nuke. Launching a nuke with a TitanIII/Agena
</em><br>
<em>&gt; booster for a ballistic strike on Mars is a far more difficult mission
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a normal ICBM. I doubt they'd get any better than 10-30 km
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&quot;They&quot; = government -&gt; Scenario presumes that the government *can't*
<br>
ship up anything, including a nuke.  Besides, anything incoming - even
<br>
with a lot of decoys - is going to be spotted far in advance.  A
<br>
non-pacifist corporation would already have intercept capability by the
<br>
time this became an issue, and plenty of time to use it.
<br>
<p>&quot;They&quot; = corporation -&gt; why bother with nukes?  They have the high
<br>
ground, so kinetic weapons are much cheaper.  Precision targeting might
<br>
be an issue: you only want to bap the high-ups who are giving you
<br>
trouble, not your customers in that country.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Not always.  To borrow from another thread: the greens can derail all
<br>
kinds of tech progress towards a greener world.  That doesn't mean they
<br>
control progess, because if they did, they'd be using it.
