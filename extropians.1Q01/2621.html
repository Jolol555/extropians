The British press offset this story by stating similar accusations were
<br>
levelled against the outgoing Rep adminstration 8 years ago, lots of desk
<br>
drawers were graffitied with the prophetic &quot;we'll be back&quot; - I don't really
<br>
see how the political pantomime in Washington has anything to do with the
<br>
extropian project. Although I do see how entertaining it is to watch.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; For those who still think the Clinton and his looters were great for our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country, read the following article about the extent of the damage to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the White House and Old Exec. Office bulding done by Clinton and Gore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staffers, and how Air Force One was stripped bare by Clinton and friends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during their 'farewell' flight.

<em>&gt; If freshman Senator Hillary isn't charged as accessory to looting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vandalism I'd be surprised. I hope the secret service searches the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chappaqua house for stolen goods.
