<p>Well, the only signals i know how to use are electromagnetic and nuclear. 
<br>
X-rays and gamma rays easily penetrate normal thicknesses of steel - as I 
<br>
referred to with the &quot;whole truck&quot; radiograph. It should be fairly easy to 
<br>
pick out &quot;strange&quot; arrangements of internal parts using this.
<br>
<p>Neutron activation would cause a burst of fission products - neutrons, 
<br>
gammas, and the like - and might not be the best way to check for a live 
<br>
bomb :)
<br>
Although, a SHORT neutron burst might not cause any embarrassing side 
<br>
effects...
<br>
<p>All of these technologies assume the importer of such devices uses normal 
<br>
shipping channels, and containers that can be inspected with methods that 
<br>
are unhealthy for living creatures.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a &quot;sniffer&quot; looking for nitro compounds? These are already 
<br>
available, and i think I read of some going into service in US airports, 
<br>
looking for conventional explosives. Again, the detector has to be fairly 
<br>
close to the item in question.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no physical phenomenon I know of that will only be 
<br>
reflected by certain elements. Spectroscopy comes close, as does NMR, but 
<br>
both require an unobstructed line of sight to (or through!) the material to 
<br>
be tested.
