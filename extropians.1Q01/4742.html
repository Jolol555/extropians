<p><em>&gt;I agree with Mike here. Blavatsky was a mystic. Her view of &quot;posthuman&quot; had

</em><br>
<p>Blavatsky was the first person to actually use the term &quot;post-human&quot; ...
<br>
although you are right that the wilder claims of her theosophy are
<br>
completely untenanable. She did discuss fossils and evolution in a mystical
<br>
context,
<br>
but I take as my definition of post (after) human the words of McGregor
<br>
Mathers, that we should strive to be &quot;more than human.&quot;
<br>
<p>The WMT debated Darwinism and the effect that evolution theory would have
<br>
on traditional, mystical, systems .. and  theoretical magick has made
<br>
adjustment and
<br>
advances in the light of science ... there is no ideological conflict
<br>
between
<br>
science and chaos magik or techno-paganism .... Dr. John Dee (astrologer
<br>
to Eliz 1 &amp; founder of Enochian system) was professor of mathematics and
<br>
navigation after all ..... Natural Magic is just experimental psychology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I scanned your Web site and did not see any definition of &quot;posthuman&quot;.
</em><br>
HERE IT IS FROM <a href="http://www.multi.co.uk/identity.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/identity.htm</a>
<br>
<p>As children we are immersed in and live out the &quot;human&quot; phase of our
<br>
evolution, absorbing - often in play - the linguistic and culturally
<br>
transmitted knowledge and traditions of our human ancestors.
<br>
<p>We can choose who we want to be, and &quot;human&quot; is not the only option. So for
<br>
example the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt and 'Divine' Monarchs of Europe in the
<br>
Middle Ages and their subjects did take seriously their magnified and
<br>
deified identities, although today we rightly tend to reject claims of
<br>
divine (supernatural) origin. The belief that we are &quot;humans&quot; is similarly a
<br>
long established cultural role and the result of conditioning reinforced by
<br>
suggestion.
<br>
<p>The notion of &quot;human&quot; had great utility when it ushered in a new era of
<br>
development, but has now been around for so long that it acts as a drag on
<br>
progress rather than as a spur to further advance. It is no more necessarily
<br>
true that we are &quot;humans&quot; than it is true that the Pharaoh was a living
<br>
solar deity, although both assumptions of identity go unchallenged and
<br>
unremarked during their own times.
<br>
<p>It might be said that the adoption of a tag such as &quot;PostHuman&quot; or
<br>
&quot;Neohuman&quot; could
<br>
become just as restraining or pre-determining as the belief that one is
<br>
human.
<br>
<p>The adoption of a neutral 'non-label' (posthuman/neo/X-) implies just that
<br>
the next step in evolution is 'after', and embodies no value judgements. I
<br>
wish to make it clear that I do not think that persuading yourself that you
<br>
are post-human will necessarily lead to any 'special powers' (but I am not
<br>
ruling that out either).
<br>
<p>&quot;TRANShumans&quot; and &quot;Extropians&quot; (if they differentiate themselves from the
<br>
human-norm at all) are examples of post/after-human variants, since trans &amp;
<br>
ex-humans are claiming to be evolved out of/ after humans. So POST-human is
<br>
the wider and inclusive category.
<br>
<p>Many might agree that humanity is in a &quot;transitory&quot; stage from which we will
<br>
emerge from as 'better adapted humans' but maintain that we are not evolving
<br>
into a substantially new species. I do not want descend into such dull
<br>
semantic discussions ...... you can always make the case that things are in
<br>
permanent transition ..... neural nets never settle to a 100% mu-state ...
<br>
but I think we might be undergoing some 'phasic transients' and major
<br>
restructuring. Anyway, no matter .... BETTER-human or MORE-THAN-human are
<br>
other variants from the NORM-human.
<br>
<p>The idea of necessary &quot;improvement&quot; is not entailed by the theory of
<br>
evolution by natural selection. There are examples of species, like the
<br>
shark for example, which have not changed significantly for a long time.
<br>
Since their design is already well fitted to their environment, any change
<br>
or mutation in shark design would more likely lead to a loss of efficiency
<br>
than an improvement.
<br>
<p>However, in this time when natural selection has partly been over-ridden, it
<br>
is up to us to decide and implement &quot;improvements.&quot;
<br>
<p>There are dangers in Nietzsche's idea of 'super-man' if you become convinced
<br>
that you are superior and somehow distinct from &quot;run of the mill&quot; animals.
<br>
Nazi interpretations of ubermenschen and so on were abhorrent ....  a blast
<br>
from our shared human-been past.
<br>
<p>Ultimate authority on matters of personal identity seem to rest with the
<br>
individual rather than with outside observers. My claim to be &quot;post-human&quot;
<br>
is irrefutable, since I know my mind and identity better than any outside
<br>
observer. The longer and more strongly that I continue to make this claim,
<br>
the more congruent, thus persuasive it becomes, both to myself and others.
<br>
<p>No doubt we continually engage in feedback with others that reinforces or
<br>
modifies our thinking about ourselves, and we share many sub-identities that
<br>
relate to activities or locations (I can be a Cornishman, a coal miner, or
<br>
both).
<br>
<p>That a person is a coal miner by trade is fairly easy to establish. If you
<br>
are normally a candle-stick maker but happen to be mining coal at a
<br>
particular time, then it is true to say that you are a &quot;coal miner&quot; only
<br>
when carrying out that exceptional (for you) activity. Your basic belief
<br>
remains that you are a candle-stick maker who happens at that moment to be
<br>
digging for coal. So some of the time you might be posthuman passing for
<br>
human &amp;c.
<br>
<p>As there were many phases, pre-human eras and so on, before the advent of
<br>
'Homo Sapiens', naturally there will be subsequent phases of evolution. It
<br>
is important to choose or guide evolutionary progress in consideration of
<br>
new and fullest knowledge, following that revealed by Darwin in the
<br>
nineteenth century.
<br>
<p>The post-human movement could turn out to be just a useful perspective that
<br>
allows us to step outside the boundaries of our conditioning temporarily.
<br>
But even if so, the post-human aesthetic makes more obvious and absurd the
<br>
supernaturalist beliefs, pollution, racism, militarism, gender
<br>
discrimination and disregard for other species that seems to compose a large
<br>
part of &quot;human-been&quot; history.

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have to assume that you are using some odd meaning of the term utterly at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;odds with how it's used within transhumanist circles.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this might be true. I usually end up arguing with trans-humanist lists.
<br>
But the point is that my definition has more utility than theirs ..... there
<br>
is
<br>
not just a single view of the future .. and I claim to be most advanced in
<br>
theoretical and natural magic (which includes ACTIVE Divination &amp; prophecy)
<br>
that there has been for 100's of years ...
<br>
<p>Evolution must be spiritually onwards, not just smarter TV sets, to keep
<br>
our balance. If you ignore possibilities for mystical experience, this is
<br>
your loss (and supernaturalism doesn't come into it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the usual meaning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you are most definitely *not* a posthuman. Or do you claim to have made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your genes irrelevant to your physical, intellectual, and emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functioning?
</em><br>
<p>No, but unlikely we ever will. This is not a *necessary* condition to be
<br>
posthuman, and has never occurred in ANY animal to date, although
<br>
many changes to new species have happened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Have you overcome the limits of aging and death?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, these are the traditional goals of the Adept. Of course no
<br>
entity can ever completely ensure against death .... the Sun might
<br>
collide into Earth or whatever.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Have you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reshaped yourself physically, cognitively, and psychologically so that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are no longer remotely human.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, I understand MVT! My psychology is pretty unique.
<br>
But we are still &quot;remotely&quot; ape-like in appearance, and I must appear
<br>
remotely human and use your crummy languages in order to communicate
<br>
with you .....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Obviously the answer is &quot;no&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Only the answers to the unreasonable conditions you arbitrarily require to
<br>
meet your particular definition of post-human (the gene point, eternal
<br>
life &amp;c.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*posthumanist*, though I'm not sure what that is, since we have very little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clue as what posthumans will be like except in general terms consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the limits of physics (insert Jupiter brain speculations here).
</em><br>
<p>I am emphatically not a *posthumanist* which I assume to be post- the
<br>
philosophical *humanism* .... with which I actually have some sympathy.
<br>
Since &quot;we have very little clue&quot; to what posthumans will be like, then it
<br>
seems up to us to proactively form our own evolution. We seem to have
<br>
a difference of opinion about what virtues are desirable ... and I am sure
<br>
that there are as many 'ideal' posthuman designs as there are people
<br>
wanting to imagine them ... the point is, how do we influence the future
<br>
to get our way, rather than be swept along by blind faith or chance.
<br>
<p>S &gt;By definition, posthumans will not exist until the singularity occurs,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't agree with Mike on this one. I'm something of a Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skeptic, though it does depend on how the term Singularity is defined. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expect a powerful swell, rather than a sudden spike. At some stage in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;swell of accelerating change we may legitimately claim to be posthuman --
</em><br>
<p>The question remains, how do we know this? The change will be gradient
<br>
and vary between individuals. I propose a much looser and less rigorous
<br>
definition in order to move things more quickly ... the very fact that you
<br>
think you are (human/ transhuman/ posthuman) eventually makes it so ..
<br>
because in order to carry on thinking that you are demands reaffirming
<br>
feedback from others and from events in the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;having made the control functions of our human genes irrelevant, having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;re-structured and massively upgraded our cognitive architecture, and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transformed our psychological functioning at multiple levels from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hardware pathways to the high-level &quot;mental&quot; structures.
</em><br>
<p>But we are *already* entirely different creatures to a century ago.
<br>
The technology explosion has happened already (although I grant
<br>
there will always be another &quot;great leap forward&quot; to be had in the
<br>
foreseeable future .. that seems in our (psychological) nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Claims to already be posthuman strike me as either being based on an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unhelpful definition of the term, or on hyperbole, or possibly on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dishonesty aimed at attracting people to a system for becoming a posthuman.
</em><br>
<p>I have never made a penny from my Posthuman advocacy!
<br>
The fact that it would cost me to join the Extropian Institute has stopped
<br>
me from joining it to date, and I think the Extro events a bit expensive.
<br>
<p>Let me ask of you the same question regards &quot;Extropianism&quot; which is
<br>
viewed by many as a money-making cult. Singularity requires a bigger
<br>
leap of faith than does MVT .... my case comes from observation of
<br>
nature (actually on film) and replicable experiments, unlike Kurzweil's
<br>
unsubstantial futur-babble.
<br>
<p>All the instructions you need to become posthuman are gratis on my
<br>
website. Furthermore, I am an entirely independent voice free of Scientism
<br>
and the whole human-era Political-Agro-Industrial complex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I will assume that the first is the case, given your lack of a definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though you Neo-Tech style hyperbole about MVT makes me wonder.
</em><br>
<p>MVT has been debated in depth on this list. The facts and claims have
<br>
always been open to scrutiny and refutation.
<br>
<p>S&gt;Your &quot;singularity&quot; is a fiction that won't happen ... rather like the
<br>
S&gt;&quot;rapture.&quot;
<br>
S&gt;What single shred of evidence do you have for it? Who wants to become
<br>
S&gt;the Borg anyway .... I prefer Dr. Who who fights against would-be daleks!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This shows a lack of knowledge about the idea of the Singularity. As I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said, I am not a Singularitarian. But it's obvious if you've looked at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussions of the issue that Borganism is *not* a necessary component of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that view.
</em><br>
<p>But it is a common enough component amongst many trans-humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Some people do foresee becoming group minds, but others who a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity ahead instead expect simply far more advanced individuals, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals with massively improved interpersonal communications .
</em><br>
<p>I think some &quot;old technology&quot; is good for interpersonal communications as
<br>
well (psychotherapy, hypnosis, acupuncture/ pressure &amp;co.) as well as some
<br>
new advances. I argue we should keep our perspective regards technology
<br>
and not get carried away with the realistic outlook for genetics &amp;c.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't mean they have lost their individuality), and all shades in
</em><br>
between.
<br>
<p>Yes, that's why I see Dr Who as a &quot;better&quot; posthuman model than Davros
<br>
and his daleks (they all had slight individuality as far as I can remember).
<br>
<p>S&gt;After (or post-) human simply indicates whatever identity comes
<br>
S&gt;after the &quot;human being&quot; stage of history .... &quot;trans-&quot; human is subset
<br>
S&gt;of the after/post-human identity ... for if we are &quot;transitional&quot; then we
<br>
S&gt;are already different from &quot;non-transitional&quot; humans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, transhuman is not a subset of posthuman.
</em><br>
<p>This depends whether we accept your or my definition of post (after)
<br>
human. I argue that post-human is *whatever* comes after (our BELIEF
<br>
that we are humans). I argue that we have already been through the
<br>
transitional stage .........
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Transhuman is a transitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stage in which humans begin making peripheral alterations to their natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condition. This started centuries ago with sensory aids (ear trumpets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eyeglasses),
</em><br>
<p>What about hermit crabs that use external shells that they find!
<br>
Your definition here is laughable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and continues with smart drugs, mood-altering drugs, gene
</em><br>
<em>&gt;therapy, etc. None of these make genes irrelevant; such people are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part of the human race -- they are part of the same gene pool. Some of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have *ideas&quot; that are well outside the norm. That's why we call ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanists and/or Extropians. None of us are posthuman. Unless someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here has been uplifted by aliens and isn't telling. :-)
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I accept you are transhuman/ Extropian if that's what you call
<br>
yourself and that's what you believe. So why can't you accept that I
<br>
am posthuman, since that is what I call myself and what I believe.
<br>
<p>On my (minimal) theory of what post-human is, then anyone who
<br>
thinks that they are &quot;well outside the norm&quot; and after human, is
<br>
&quot;posthuman.&quot; We evolved from an 'ape' species (I assume you
<br>
accept this?) into homo sapiens (eventually) ... but our genes did
<br>
not become irrelevant! How do we know that in the distant future
<br>
genes might not be *even more* relevant?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I also disagree on the utility of general principles (not *rules*), but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think Daniel Ust has responded well on that point.
</em><br>
<p>This is partly a matter of cognitive style and choice. Principles and
<br>
even heuristics make me intellectually uncomfortable. As a neural
<br>
net designer more than a 'coder' programmer, this would be expected,
<br>
I prefer bottom up modelling to &quot;top down&quot; principles.
<br>
<p>But sure, lots of folks feel more comfortable with strong guidelines ...
<br>
me just like to think things out for myself and experiment a bit !!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What bothers me about your talking about being posthuman is that others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will see that and think that it makes no sense, then may also dismiss the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more grounded claims of transhumanism.
</em><br>
<p>I take issue that transhumanist claims are more &quot;grounded&quot; than mine,
<br>
and am prepared to argue my case against anyone.
<br>
<p>And for someone promoting more interpersonal communication, I find
<br>
your paranoia of me (or others) TALKING ABOUT posthumans quite
<br>
dictatorial. Let's widen the debate, draw more people in, not draw more
<br>
definitional boundaries to keep non-extropes at bay. .
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;These people actually think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are a different species. Just another wacko bunch who want to think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are superior to everyone else.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Better me than Marilyn Manson then! And why not the Taoist concept
<br>
of &quot;the Superior Man&quot; .... read your Tao te Ching .. superior man =
<br>
posthuman.
<br>
<p>I am here already, and more are coming ... there are already small colonies
<br>
.... your denial of posthuman existence simply does not hold.
