Hi E. Shaun,
<br>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to generate the stats...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wouldn't say that this is a reflection of anyone who considers his or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herself &quot;extropian,&quot; but a reflection of those willing (or able) to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their money where their minds are.  Amara's estimate is probably closer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being correct for extropians as a whole.  In my recollection, past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conferences have had roughly 1/3 of the audience and speakers as female,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for what it's worth.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect a large fraction of those women at conferences, if
<br>
asked, would not identify themselves as extropian.  Rather, I think many come
<br>
along to indulge their SO's eccentric interests.
<br>
<p>However, are these statistics unique to Extropianism?  Do other radical
<br>
social movements (radical in the sense of advocating large changes from the
<br>
status quo) show similar disproportions?  I have no hard numbers but the
<br>
greens seem to attract a much higher percentage of women.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, men outnumber women 5:1 in Ron Merrill's count of the members
<br>
of the IOS (Insitute for Objectivist Studies) scholars directory.
<br>
