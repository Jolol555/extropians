</em><br>
<p>Considering just this paragraph, I would be inclined to agree. If someone
<br>
was kicking at my door trying to kill me, I would love to have the
<br>
opportunity to shoot the hell out of him.
<br>
<p>The fact is, if that's some cowboy land there that you live in, having
<br>
weapons to protect yourself against these threats is the only reasonable
<br>
attitude. If the probability of such an attack on your person ever happening
<br>
is great enough, you need to have a way of protecting yourself. With a gun.
<br>
I'm quite sure that was the case when your constitution was written.
<br>
<p>I'm not quite sure that the probability is still high enough to warrant
<br>
everyone's posession of firearms, though. It might just be that you're
<br>
artificially sustaining a belief in how great that probability is, just so
<br>
that you might cling on to your weaponry.
<br>
<p>Like ol' Michael S. Lorrey over there, who tried to impress the world with
<br>
the claim that Europe has 100 the rate of firearms killings compared to the
<br>
US.
