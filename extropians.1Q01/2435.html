<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is the nature of human being negotiated and conditional or is

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the nature of human beings a given?  If it is a given then it
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; how people treat one another, are fundamental to the well-being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; First of all, I don't subscribe to the idea that we are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any way all the same, hence I dislike the claim that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nature of human beings is a given.
</em><br>
<p>[This was said now:]
<br>
<em>&gt; I never ever said we are all the same nor implied it except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we all share being human beings and therefore have everything in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common that is subsumed by that term.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. I agree with that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The gist of my questions above is that by the very fact of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing at all we as human beings exist as something,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist with certain properties.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree with that, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would be quite surprised if the commonalities of our humanness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not imply that there are basic ways that we can be treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are relatively much more advantageous to our success and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wellbeing than other ways we can be treated.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is nothing terribly complex and certainly does not imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we all wish to be treated exactly the same in ALL respects.
</em><br>
<p>You are right, it does not. [There's a &quot;But&quot;, see below]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is an unwarranted argument.
</em><br>
<p>Mmmm. I wouldn't jump to this conclusion so fast; there's another subtlety.
<br>
<p>You confirm that you agree that not everyone wishes to be treated the same
<br>
in all respects. This seems to imply that, while a subset of people in a
<br>
given community may desire one thing, another subset of people might reject
<br>
it. Now, your theory of rights seems to imply that either of these groups is
<br>
wrong; perhaps an arbitrator is now needed to determine which one. On the
<br>
other hand, my theory would imply that these groups somehow need to
<br>
negotiate a common set of rights that they will all be able to live by;
<br>
there is no predetermined 'holy' right, whatever they negotiate is fine.
<br>
<p>Take paedophiles for instance. [First a disclaimer: I'm not a historian, so
<br>
if I will be misstating facts, correct me.] According to my knowledge,
<br>
Ancient Greeks had a practice of male adults socializing with boys. An adult
<br>
man would assume sponsorship over a boy, introducing him to the ways of the
<br>
world, while the boy returned the favor in terms of sexual obedience. The
<br>
boy was &quot;educated from behind&quot;, literally speaking.
<br>
<p>So, in those days, a man had a right to have sexual intercourse with a
<br>
willing boy. Boys generally accepted this, and conducted sexual intercourse
<br>
with other boys when they grew up.
<br>
<p>Nowadays, such behavior would be severely punished. It wouldn't just be
<br>
frowned upon, most people would be literally disgusted. So, nowadays men
<br>
definitely don't have that right anymore.
<br>
<p>What is your view on this? In particular, I stated that &quot;in those days, a
<br>
man had a right...&quot;. Do you agree with that statement or would you argue
<br>
that, in fact, men did *not* have that right, and that they heinously
<br>
violated basic human rights as we know them to be?
<br>
<p>If the former, then I would say I have shown my point. If the latter, I
<br>
might come up with another example that is even more in the gray area, and
<br>
then we can see about that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Nice strawman.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm trying. :-)
