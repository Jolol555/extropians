<em>&gt;Subject: Re: The IFG - Still don't think.....
</em><br>
&lt;Loads snipped&gt;
<br>
<p>Just wanted to add a point on the whole Imperialism debate.  It seems that 
<br>
in the rush to determine whether colonization was good or bad, we are 
<br>
lacking opinions from those whose countries were directly affected by 
<br>
it.  I come from just such a country, and we were affected for a far longer 
<br>
time than the rest of the British Empire, with perhaps the exceptions of 
<br>
Scotland and Wales.
<br>
<p>I remember catching the end of a programme on British TV a few years 
<br>
ago.  Some guy (lower middle class, not a toff by any standards) going on 
<br>
about how &quot;I'll tell you what, we probably ran those countries better than 
<br>
they could have run them themselves!&quot; or words to that effect.
<br>
<p>I can also remember an incident told to me by my sister from the mid 
<br>
90's.  During the filming of the movie &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, the Union Jack 
<br>
was required to be flown above Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin.  My sister came 
<br>
across an elderly man staring stunned in the street as it was hoisted.  He 
<br>
explained to her of the wave of memories that came to him as he looked at 
<br>
it.  Of the overwhelming fear.  He'd been a young boy the last time it was 
<br>
raised for real over the city, but that time had remained vivid in his memory.
<br>
<p>The point of the matter isn't whether we can run a country better because 
<br>
we've been &quot;civilized&quot; or not, the point is whether we asked them to come 
<br>
in the first place.  While in Ireland's case in the early years of the 
<br>
British claim to the country, many here were loyal to the crown, there came 
<br>
a time when it was clear they had outstayed their welcome.  When they'd 
<br>
passed enough laws removing basic rights from the majority of the 
<br>
population.  When we finally drove them out, we were left with horrendous 
<br>
housing, subsistence farming, no power grid worth a damn (unless you were 
<br>
the upper class) and a tragic religious conflict.  What little 
<br>
infrastructure was there was not installed for our benefit, it was so the 
<br>
British could have a little bit of home away from home.
<br>
<p>Would we have turned out differently?  Would we have been more advanced, 
<br>
more &quot;civilized&quot; if they'd never come?  Would we have been 
<br>
savages?  Irrelevant.  The simple fact is that it was our country to 
<br>
run.  They were our mistakes to make.  Our destiny should have been in OUR 
<br>
OWN hands, not decided for us by some Overlord.  There's no way to know 
<br>
what we might have been all those centuries, but Imperialism did us no 
<br>
favours.  Good or bad, it should have been OUR country to shape.
<br>
<p>Don't try to rationalize Imperialism after the fact, it is an insult to 
<br>
those who suffered from it.  It's also the habit of those who are from 
<br>
nations who've never had to endure it.
<br>
<p>Slan,
<br>
<p><p><p>James....
<br>
<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
