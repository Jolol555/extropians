Because Greg invoked my name (or some &quot;Tom&quot; at any
<br>
rate), I'll just add that the &quot;lower standard&quot; to which
<br>
he refers equates to &quot;at least recklessness.&quot;  In other
<br>
words, under U.S. law you will be held liable for
<br>
defaming a public figure or public official only if you
<br>
speak with willful disregard of the accuracy of your 
<br>
statement or, to go further, with intentional malice to
<br>
harm his/her reputation.
<br>
<p>Among the important caveats: Because it relies crucially
<br>
on the First Amendment, this is not a principle of
<br>
common law systems generally.  English courts, to take
<br>
one example, find defamation much more readily.
