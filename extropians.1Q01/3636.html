<br>
<p>The Standard Model describes how three of the four fundamental forces - the
<br>
strong, weak and electromagnetic forces, but not gravity - affect subatomic
<br>
particles. The anomalous results came from an experiment to determine how
<br>
much the 'spin' on a muon moves or 'precesses' when placed in a magnetic
<br>
field. The physicists injected an intense beam of muons into a powerful
<br>
magnetic field and measured the so-called g-2 ('g minus 2') value. The
<br>
g-factor of a particle relates its magnetic moment to its intrinsic angular
<br>
momentum or spin. The g-factor of both the muon and its lighter sibling, the
<br>
electron, are slightly larger than 2 due to various 'radiative corrections'.
<br>
Precise measurements of g-2 are powerful tests of theory.
<br>
<p>The team found that the new value differed from the Standard Model by 2.6
<br>
standard deviations - in contrast with values previously obtained less
<br>
rigorous experiments that exactly matched the predictions of the theory. &quot;We
<br>
are 99% sure that the present Standard Model calculations cannot describe
<br>
our data&quot;, said Gerry Bunce, project manager of the experiment.
<br>
<p>The results can be interpreted in three ways. Firstly, the Standard Model is
<br>
fundamentally correct but need to be extended: the team could, for instance,
<br>
have glimpsed evidence of supersymmetry. This theory states that every
<br>
particle has a companion particle called its superpartner. &quot;Many people
<br>
believe that the discovery of supersymmetry may be just around the corner&quot;,
<br>
said team member Lee Roberts, &quot;We may have opened the first tiny window to
<br>
that world&quot;. Secondly, it is still statistically possible that the value is
<br>
consistent with theory. Thirdly, the model may be incomplete or entirely
<br>
wrong.
<br>
<p>(Somebody - i.e. prof. Tullio Regge - is suggesting
<br>
that particles and dimensions are ...... infinite)
