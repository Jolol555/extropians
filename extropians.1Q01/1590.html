<em>&gt; &gt;A single optical cable can carry at least 6.4tbit/sec, so 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;optical cables can provide all the required dedicated bandwidth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;serve the same stuff that all those copper cables do. The cables
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are there now, and are simply being lit up as needed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;various companies running them. I'm sorry, but the times when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;data amounts used for voice seemed big are over. In the relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;near future the data passing over the Net will dwarf what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;phone carriers deal with now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No system being sold runs at anything near these numbers. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently got to play with OC-768 which is a mere 40 GBS. The big
</em><br>
<p>...which runs over a single wavelength of light among many many in a single
<br>
fiber. These technologies most certainly ARE commercially available. There
<br>
are also terabit routers available to handle the packets (Charlotte's Web,
<br>
etc.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; problem is that while 100 cables can theoretically carry the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traffic, the reality is that connections will need to be made to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many thousands of different points. We will need a thousand times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Internet we have today. I also stated that these networks will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to be built to accomodate QOS which they do not now.
</em><br>
<p>Well this goes back to the old circuit vs. packet switching argument. I think
<br>
you just throw more bandwidth at it, and QoS concerns go away. I mean if you
<br>
have a 100mbit connection to your home, you really don't have to worry about
<br>
making 64kbit phone calls. Do you really think QoS will matter in a world like
<br>
that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the bandwidth increases, eventually the cost of the bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to conduct a voice call will be miniscule, but we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of billions of dollars from that point. TANSTAAFL.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, it ain't cheap to get there. You might enjoy watching this video:

<br>
<p>Translation: switch to IP and fiber or die
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The days of saying the phone companies understand voice but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't understand data are over.
</em><br>
<p>We'll see... T not looking so hot lately
