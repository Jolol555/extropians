<p>Good question, one to which I don't have a definite answer.  I know 
<br>
that many of the people that I met lived in extended family 
<br>
dwellings, so I'd guess that if you have family, you have a home.  I 
<br>
know that I never saw big groups of women standing around, so 
<br>
assuming a reasonable division of men and women in the society, why 
<br>
are the men all homeless and unemployed, but the women aren't?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;That has not been my experience with the people from India that come to

</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  The engineers that you're seeing here who make it from 
<br>
India are a huge cut above the ones who don't.  They had the 
<br>
motivation to do all the work that it takes to get sponsorship.
<br>
<p>I didn't at all mean to say in my original post that there aren't any 
<br>
good Indian engineers.  Far from it.  I've known some excellent 
<br>
Indian engineers in my career.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I can believe that generations of poverty plus generations of foreign
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;teach this world is maya do not help.
</em><br>
<p>Tied up with their religion is that nasty caste system.  Nothing like 
<br>
a god-given right to treat your fellow countrymen like crap.
<br>
<p>The enormous difference in the average life in India and here is such 
<br>
an eye-opener.  If you ever get the chance to spend real time there, 
<br>
I'd highly recommend it.  You might not enjoy your time there, but 
<br>
it's tremendously educational.  At very least (especially after the 
<br>
local microbes get you &quot;going&quot;), you'll never take your western 
<br>
toilet and ready availability of toilet paper for granted again in 
<br>
your life. :)
