<p><em>&gt;Most all of my black friends (or African Americans if you prefer)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;live with being pulled over quite often.  I think it even gets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the point where they feel that it's just something you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deal with and they expect it.  One such friend was astonished when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I told him I'd only ever been pulled over once.  He get's pulled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over quite a lot, as does his parents, friends, etc. And these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all middle to upper class people.  They just happen to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong skin color.
</em><br>
<p>This sad phenomenon is do to the tremendous lag time between the
<br>
discovery of a scientific fact and it's eventual incorporation into
<br>
human culture.
<br>
<p>The fact is that every piece of scientific evidence has proven that
<br>
we are all one species, and that we originated in the Rift valley
<br>
area of what is now modern day Kenya.
<br>
<p>Every Homo-sapien's on the planet is of African origin.
<br>
<p>We are all literally Africans.
<br>
<p>I prefer the term American-African myself, where you are is more
<br>
important than where you came from.
<br>
<p>Don't let my pale skin fool you, and don't let your's fool you.
<br>
We are all originally from Africa.
<br>
<p>Proud descendant of a member of the first diaspora.
