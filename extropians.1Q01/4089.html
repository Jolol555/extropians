<em>&gt;The Cutting Edge of Cutting Calories

<em>&gt;By Henry I. Miller

<em>&gt;The Scientist 15[4]:39, Feb. 19, 2001
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2001/feb/opin_010219.html">http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2001/feb/opin_010219.html</a>

<p><em>&gt;While olestra causes mild gastrointestinal symptoms in a small number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of consumers, the frequency is no greater than with regular, full-fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chips.
</em><br>
<p>Olestra is a non-digestible oil.  Like Castor Oil, it goes all the 
<br>
way through the system and can cause uncontrollable diarrhea and 
<br>
cramping.  It is true that scientific studies show that the incidence 
<br>
of this to no higher with Olestra than with regular chips.  But for 
<br>
some reason, consumers of regular chips don't seem to report this 
<br>
phenomenon while consumers of Olestra do.  The scientific studies do 
<br>
not seem to match the experience of actual consumers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The bad news is on the political front. FDA regulators have been far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too conservative with this nutritional aid. They granted limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approval, permitting olestra only for fried snacks, although the product
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is uniquely versatile and can be used instead of margarine, lard,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;butter, and other oils in frying, baking, and sautéing.
</em><br>
<p>It is normal for the FDA to review consumer complaints for a new food 
<br>
or drug product.  If there is a high number of complaints, they 
<br>
require these to be studied before use of the new product can be 
<br>
expanded into higher-use applications.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The agency has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been unenthusiastic about additional uses, even though the safety and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usefulness of the product are unquestioned.
</em><br>
<p>It is not quite fair to say that the safety is unquestioned.  FDA 
<br>
procedures review customer complaints in addition to scientific 
<br>
testing.  New foods or drugs often encounter problems in the field 
<br>
that are not detected by testing.  We cannot just ignore a high 
<br>
number of consumer complaints just because laboratory testing cannot 
<br>
reproduce the problem.  All recalled products, such as Thalidomide, 
<br>
were first proven safe in the laboratory.  Some of their effects were 
<br>
not detected until a high number of problem reports started coming in 
<br>
from the field.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Olestra is the most tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt;food substance in history: Over the past 30 years, there have been more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than 150 animal studies and 100 human clinical trials involving more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than 24,000 adults and children--far more than the testing of most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prescription drugs.
</em><br>
<p>This is simply hyperbole.  As the author of _The_Nutrients_Catalog_ 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://HarveyNewstrom.com/biotech/nutrientscatalog/index.html">http://HarveyNewstrom.com/biotech/nutrientscatalog/index.html</a>&gt; , I 
<br>
can confirm that there have been more than 150 animal tests and 100 
<br>
human clinical trials performed on most vitamins, minerals, amino 
<br>
acids, and basic foods.  Olestra is not the most tested food 
<br>
substance in history.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why would federal health regulators unnecessarily restrict such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desirable and popular product?
</em><br>
<p>Because many people report severe, painful and embarrassing symptoms 
<br>
within an hour of eating this substance.  Although they can't 
<br>
reproduce this in the lab, something is happening to many consumers 
<br>
of this product.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    The FDA's failure to promote--let alone to permit--wider use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;olestra represents the most lamentable kind of regulatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decision-making. The regulators have been cavalier toward public health,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preemptive of consumers' freedom to choose, and punitive to a company
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that spent hundreds of millions of dollars in good faith to develop a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;safe and effective product.
</em><br>
<p>Although I don't agree with the FDA on many issues, I am not sure 
<br>
they have singled out this product for special treatment.  They seem 
<br>
to be following the same procedures that they use for any product. 
<br>
Products that receive a high number of health complaints are not 
<br>
likely to be allowed expanded usage until the reason for those 
<br>
complaints are determined.  Failure to reproduce these symptoms in 
<br>
the lab does not explain what is happening in the field.  The medical 
<br>
explanation for these symptoms remains unexplained.
