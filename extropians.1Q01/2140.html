<br>
<em>&gt;As someone who makes a living off of Microsoft, I'd like to write a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things:
</em><br>
<p>i think this is a very important point. it's easy to dislike successful 
<br>
people who make success rather than quality-oriented decisions, in an 
<br>
abstract and ivory tower sort of way, but it's hard to deny, when 
<br>
pragmaticism sets in, that they haven't furthered the GENERAL cause of 
<br>
economy, their industry, and standard of living.
<br>
<p>another example would be Ford. yes he was a control freak, yes, he refused 
<br>
to change the Model T until he was forced to. and yes he was really really 
<br>
odd in private and public life. but how many jobs did he create? how much 
<br>
resources did he use and put out for public consumption? and how many people 
<br>
have benefited from things like the Ford Foundation(which is a tiny 
<br>
percentage of how much money ford made).
<br>
<p>I can dislike many of the decisions Gates makes. but i have to respect both 
<br>
his business acumen, and his programming skills(expanded through his company 
<br>
and resources(peons) of course). as something of a pragmaticist, i must 
<br>
point out that this is a man who is DOING things, and on a scale unheard of 
<br>
for any other entity. the man has donated more money than has EVER been 
<br>
donated to Educational purposes before in a single sitting. as a student, i 
<br>
can appreciate that.
<br>
<p>not to sound too Randish, but industrialists are extropic.
