<p>
Samantha,
<br>
<p>I'm not really sure what world you're living in.  Apparently you feel that
<br>
it is impossible to program anything useful in Visual Basic or even any
<br>
other Microsoft tool.  I was personally involved in a VB project that
<br>
enabled Carolina Power and Light's bulk power marketing team the ability to
<br>
sell and buy excess power thus adding millions of dollars to the company's
<br>
bottom line.  This was a 24/7 application that was written entirely in
<br>
Visual Basic 5 using an Oracle back end.  Stupid me, I didn't know anything
<br>
about stored procedures back then, but dang it if the thing didn't work just
<br>
fine in spite of my lack of Oracality.
<br>
<p>By the way, just about all the development at Carolina and Power (which now
<br>
has some other name since they bought a power company in Florida) is done
<br>
with Microsoft technologies.  And gee, the company does just fine.
<br>
<p>I am currently involved in an application at Honeywell which uses multiple
<br>
components written in Visual Basic 6.  Oh dear, since this software is so
<br>
horrible, it must be a big mistake!  Nope, works just fine.  Does the job.
<br>
<p>Let's see... Fortune 500 company Becton and Dickinson trusted me to write
<br>
several very important business components for  their SAP deployment - in
<br>
Visual Basic.  Status?  Works just fine.
<br>
<p>Intel, *gasp* uses Microsoft technolgies.  Intel, Samantha, is a very large
<br>
company.  And they use Microsoft technologies, including Visual Basic and
<br>
Active Server Pages.
<br>
<p>It makes me wonder, if Visual Basic is such a &quot;weak&quot; tool, why so many huge,
<br>
succesful companies bank on it...
<br>
<p>I don't want to take anything away from the legions of Java and
<br>
Unix/Linux/WhateverElse programmers out there.  They do work just as good as
<br>
us VB guys.  :)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As someone who makes a living off of Microsoft, I'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1.  There are a LOT of Visual Basic and ASP (Active Server Pages)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; programmers.  I think there's more VB programmers than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  other type in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I know.  And it fills me with great sorrow that so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are sorely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afflicted.  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2.  An awful lot of these programmers make a lot more money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once they move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into VB and/or ASP programming from whatever jobs they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does this mean that what they are doing is actually good or that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools are good?  Does it mean it is actually part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software crisis rather than another part of the problem?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3.  Most (but not all - I'd say about 70-80%) of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; folks are not what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most Unix/Linux/Java guys think of as programmers.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; science background.  They have no concepts of object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oriented programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and for what they're doing, they don't need it.  These guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gals solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specific problems for businesses.  They may not get paid as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much as a senior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Java developer, but $45K - $65K is not unheard of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really scary that so many &quot;business solutions&quot; are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slung together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by people who are not programmers using tools as weak and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Visual Basic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of us who have had to debug and/or maintain and extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;solutions&quot; blanch when we hear such.  A basic data structures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms class and a simple introduction to OO is not at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to come by and really should be required.  Business that would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer solutions written and deployed by people without at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum deserve to have their IT functions come crashing down on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4.  With #3 in mind, it is safe to say that 70-80% of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have a difficult time getting a &quot;real&quot; programming job and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stuck in the dreary, low paying job they had previously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5.  I know this can't be a forgone conclusion, but it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Microsoft has created a fantastic opportunity for millions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yet non-computer science trained people to make much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could if Microsoft didn't exist.  These people contribute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; economy, and I think the world is better off with them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Making money and doing good work that actually is a net gain are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very different things.  Microsoft has handed loaded computer guns to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untrained software children.  The 'guns' are so defective they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to seriously maim the enterprise using them even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly skilled and trained developers.  But people are making money by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply waving them around ok.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most of the Visual Basic developers that I know are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trained.  Most easily found a job after doing a bit of work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at home and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; free for others.  Many have no college degrees.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware, though, of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; successful business projects that are implemented solely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Visual Basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and other Microsoft products.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; College degrees as such aren't the criteria.  Knowing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basics of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; craft is the criteria.  I know many highly degreed CS people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design and program their way out of the proverbial paper bag.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is certainly a place for tools that don't require full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talents to use effectively.  But those tools must fit well within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger programming framework.  This requires more openness than MS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps I'm an idiot, or a blind sheep following an EVIL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company, but by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; working for companies which use Microsoft software I am now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earning more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than SEVEN times as much money this year than I did in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1995.  My wife, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has no college degree, is making more than $50 an hour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; programming with Microsoft technologies.  That's money that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're using to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; buy a new house, have lots of cool toys, and ensure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our son gets the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; best private education available in Phoenix, AZ.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With a bit of training you could be making $200/hr or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consulting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But again, the money is not a valid criteria of the worth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I know of a LOT of more people with similar stories.  Scott
</em><br>
<em>&gt; McNealy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Larry Ellison have created no where NEAR the opportunity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level of success as Bill Gates has - directly or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirectly.  I don't love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Microsoft or Bill Gates, but I do respect them for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have given me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, excuse me, but the computer revolution in general with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the attendant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge demand for software and the dirth of programmers created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying jobs, NOT Bill Gates.  Bill Gates and MS have fought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, arguably much better, tools being as widely used by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even novices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Visual Basic is today.  Gates and company have sabotaged and killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many companies, tools and projects to address the software crises much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than these brain-dead MS tools do.
</em><br>
