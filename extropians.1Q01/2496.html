<p>
<em>&gt;  &gt;Why would you say that I &quot;wish&quot; them upon my child...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Because you said your child needed hard realities, and it's common 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to wish for one's child's needs to be fulfilled.
</em><br>
<p>My child &quot;needs&quot; immunization from the measles, that doesn't mean 
<br>
that I &quot;wish&quot; to see her stuck with needles.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;I dare say that I love my child every bit as much as I'm sure you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;love yours, so let's avoid maligning each others' motives, okay?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm assuming you love your child. I think you're mistaken, not evil.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, yes, I'm mistaken.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   &gt;Are you surprised to learn that we do it because we love our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children dearly and want to make their lives easier?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, not surprised at all. I just think you're mistaken in believing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you can use force to help someone learn. Force results in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change of behavior, but it doesn't show the child how to learn and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to think for herself.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I'm mistaken.  I got that earlier.  How does learning things 
<br>
that you need to learn preclude learning to think for yourself? 
<br>
Ideally, my child will be able to function reasonably well in either 
<br>
situation.
<br>
<p>I'm not talking about military discipline here.  I'm talking about a 
<br>
balance.  I don't want to raise a mindless soldier and I don't want 
<br>
to raise a whiny cry-baby unable to cope with life's unrelenting 
<br>
difficulties.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And how would this relate to disciplining a child? Are you saying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you'll arrange situations in which the child is thwarted so she'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know how to achieve goals?
</em><br>
<p>No, usually, it's about letting her work past day-to-day difficulties 
<br>
herself, rather than assisting her.  Naturally, there's a balance to 
<br>
be struck:  we don't want her to become overly frustrated with tasks 
<br>
that are just too advanced, but we also don't want her to rely upon 
<br>
us to do tasks that are within her ability.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;Yes, when our daughter cried upon being put to bed at certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;times, we let her cry for a bit before going to bed.  Training her 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to go to bed &gt;at a certain time early on means that she's now very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reliable about knowing her limits concerning bedtime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There's no doubt you can train a child into certain patterns of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior. Surely you did the bedtime training for your own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convenience though, rather than for the child's benefit?
</em><br>
<p>You seem like a nice person, Barbara, but I just don't understand why 
<br>
you continue to malign my motivations.
<br>
<p>Bedtime training is mostly for her benefit.  Discipline isn't just a 
<br>
tool for parents to maintain order.  It's a gift that you give a 
<br>
child that she can use her whole life to help her to reach her goals.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Somehow I don't see anything so horrible about *still* rocking a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little 3 1/2 year old child to sleep. One person's whims may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another person's important issues. I don't want to put words into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your post, but it appears to me as though you have the attitude that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply because you're older and bigger, your way is the right way, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the younger, smaller person's preferences don't count for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything.
</em><br>
<p>Can't you even begin to assume that my motivations are noble and that 
<br>
actions I take or don't take are for her benefit above all?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; The kid has an absolute panic attack if she isn't there when he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wakes up from a nap.  You were mentioning &quot;independence&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I hardly think 3 1/2 years is an age at which we should expect human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children to be out on their own.
</em><br>
<p>Who's talking about their being out on their own?  I'm talking about 
<br>
not seeing mommy in the room and panicking.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Do you really think a person should be independent at such an early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;age? In the usual course of childhood, independence is gained 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gradually, a step at a time, and full independence doesn't come 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until 14 or 15 (in our culture, of course, we typically prolong the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;period of dependence until 18 - 22)
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, but you were talking about lack of &quot;coercion&quot; leading to 
<br>
self-confidence and independence.  I'm just pointing out that my 
<br>
experience is that your philosophy leads to the opposite, a lack of 
<br>
independence and a lack of self-confidence.  Making excuses for that 
<br>
3 1/2 year old doesn't change the fact that our daughter seems to be 
<br>
*far* more independent and self-confident at a much younger age.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;I think rather than more discipline, what's needed is for people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to understand the learning and thinking process and to acknowledge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that &gt;&gt;learning and thinking cannot be forced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;When I was an employee at a company, and my boss said, &quot;We need to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;implement this totally different X with this new technology Y.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;You bet your sweet bippy that I did some forced learning and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;thinking. That's the way life normally works, and to shield 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;children from being &gt;trained in methods of coping with that is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;tremendous disservice to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Good training for followers of orders, to be sure. But how about for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creative, independent thinkers?
</em><br>
<p>How does being able to follow orders preclude being creative and 
<br>
independent?  I've been an employee, and I've owned my own successful 
<br>
corporation.  At some points I've needed to rely on my ability to 
<br>
follow orders, at some points I've needed to rely on my ability to 
<br>
think creatively to charge out into new markets.  Since my parents 
<br>
had fairly similar child-rearing philosophies to my own, I'd say that 
<br>
they were rather successful at raising a creative, independent 
<br>
thinker who has a great deal of self confidence and a cheerful 
<br>
outlook on life.  What more could they have wanted? :)
<br>
<p>Yes, yes, I know.  I'm mistaken.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
