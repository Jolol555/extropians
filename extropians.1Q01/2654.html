<p>Samantha also mentioned `induction' as a supplement to deduction. Of course
<br>
a post-Popperian will insist that induction isn't a formal procedure, just
<br>
shorthand for making a guess based on clumpings or chunkings noted by
<br>
feature detectors evolved in a fitness landscape with detectable
<br>
regularities. 
<br>
<p>Another suggested formalization possibly of interest is semiotician and
<br>
pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce's* `abduction', or retrodiction. That's
<br>
his stab at an explanation of the logic of how, when faced with startling
<br>
facts, we crystallize some single hypothesis out of the myriad possible.
<br>
Peirce hoped it would take its place in the accepted armamentarium of
<br>
logic, alongside deduction and induction. In the event, Karl Popper arrived
<br>
to throw induction out the door as well, although it seems to be creeping
<br>
back in again lately. 
<br>
<p>Abduction never really took off, perhaps because its method is impossibly
<br>
hard to specify. (As I say, I suspect that what Peirce mistook for the
<br>
activity of an abductive logic is actually one or more cognitive templates
<br>
kicking in at a level inaccessible to scrutiny, the kind of painfully
<br>
evolved filter that matches language's universal grammar to those aspects
<br>
of the world salient to human survival.) `Abduction' would go more directly
<br>
to detectable regularities and pluck out their deep grammar. All the more
<br>
reason to couple your evolving AI as closely as possible to the real
<br>
external world allowing the critter amply opportunities to explore it while
<br>
enabling the world to have its impact in return.
<br>
<p>*(Peirce is pronounced `Purse', BTW)
