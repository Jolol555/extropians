&quot;The trick might be to engineer people to have less simplistic desires. To 
<br>
engineer people who have a desire for action, rather than aversion against 
<br>
it.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't think that is quite possible. There will always be a balance between 
<br>
lazy and &quot;action-oriented&quot; people. Someone set in an environment with lots 
<br>
of working and ambicious people will feel a sort of inner urge to find peace 
<br>
in contempt, whereas someone in a &quot;lazy environment&quot; will feel the urge to 
<br>
attain higher goals simply because the resources are there to be used and no 
<br>
one seems to be interested. In previous social models, you had the &quot;peasant&quot; 
<br>
classes, who couldn't do any particular action because of their education 
<br>
and economic possibilities, and blamed their lack of enthusiasm on their 
<br>
lack of resources. Nowadays, in western countries, nearly everyone can get a 
<br>
degree and have access to information (internet and libraries) and ambitious 
<br>
ideas are everywhere, but still you see the great majority of people 
<br>
settling down with what they consider enough.
<br>
<p>I believe that dispersion is actually beneficial, since it is that kind of 
<br>
&quot;inate stupidity&quot; and stuborness that prevents some people of actually 
<br>
believing in some very rationally convincing and charismatic ideas, that in 
<br>
the end turn out to be not that much true. Previous to Einstein, a lot of 
<br>
people came up with those kind of &quot;stupid ideas&quot;, actually trying to 
<br>
convince themselves that the almighty newtonian laws of movement where 
<br>
false. Altough they are quickly dismissed because they themselves often come 
<br>
up with those ideas out of nothing and with no clue as to how things 
<br>
actually worked, the things they claimed still stir our imaginations. If 
<br>
Einstein had taken a degree in physics, he might have had all those existing 
<br>
laws so engraved in his mind that the thought of coming up with something 
<br>
radically new would seem impossible.
<br>
<p>And remember that usually the most valued art comes from the least ambitious 
<br>
people and those with more simplistic desires.
<br>
<p>&quot;Take your time to look at the things God has made for you to see, and you 
<br>
won't have the time to search those He hid from you.&quot;
