Robin is worried that speculators will ruin the market for these social 
<br>
policy incentive bonds by buying too many of them.
<br>
<p>I can't see how this is a long term problem.  Ticket scalpers may buy more 
<br>
tickets than they can sell.  They take the loss.  If speculators buy too 
<br>
many bonds and prevent the do-gooders from getting enough to make doing 
<br>
good worthwhile, the speculators will lose out and learn not to speculate 
<br>
on social policy bonds they don't intend to take action on.  If the 
<br>
do-gooders wait a while, the speculators will realize their misfortune 
<br>
(because the market will fall since no one is performing good works) and 
<br>
sell.  The do-gooders can now buy at reduced prices.
<br>
<p>Why will the price stay high if the ownership by the wrong people is 
<br>
preventing the good works from being in anyone's interest?
<br>
<p><p>Robin also suggests that short sellers may be a problem.  In this case, I 
<br>
would want to know whether the short sellers can take manifest actions that 
<br>
prevent the goal from being reached, or whether they have to be 
<br>
surreptitious.  It may be necessary to stay away from issues where short 
<br>
sellers would have enough leverage to earn a profit.
<br>
<p>Robin actually started this section out by saying &quot;for every buyer there is 
<br>
a seller.&quot;  It would actually be the case that the first seller prefers to 
<br>
pay out the bond and reach the goal rather than not issue the bond.  So the 
<br>
first pair both prefer success.  There after, every seller (includig short 
<br>
sellers) is matched with a buyer.  The short seller may have an interest in 
<br>
the failure of the project, but if the prospective buyer believes that the 
<br>
seller can prevent success, he'd be silly to create someone with that 
<br>
incentive.
<br>
<p>I think the machinations that allow short selling are that some holders 
<br>
lend out their shares to people who want to sell them with the intention of 
<br>
buying them back later at lower price.  If holders (who have a continuing 
<br>
interest in the pursuit of the social goal) can refuse to lend and thereby 
<br>
prevent short sellers from having the reverse incentive, then the problem 
<br>
doesn't seem to arise.  I'm not sure my description of the mechanics of the 
<br>
market are correct, though.
