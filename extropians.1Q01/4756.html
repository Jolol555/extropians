<em>&gt;&gt;You have to read these recount reports carefully.  This is not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Miami-Dade county recount results.  This particular article only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;looked at the 10,644 ballots that were undervoted in Miami-Dada 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;country.  They wanted to find out if the specific disruption caused 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;by GOP staff members flying to Miami to start a riot could have had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;an effect on the election.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;C'mon, Harvey, is that a fair characterization?  Jesse Jackson and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rep Wexler(D) were the first ones in the news down there that I saw. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It seemed that Jesse Jackson was with protesters on the street of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Palm Beach County before James Baker even arrived in Florida.
</em><br>
<p>No it is not a fair characterization.  This was the Liberal viewpoint 
<br>
of what happened.  I was not endorsing the Liberal viewpoint.  I was 
<br>
merely reporting what the motivations for this recount was.  This 
<br>
recount was not intended to show the total vote of Miami-Dade.  It 
<br>
was limited just to those votes that were almost counted, but then 
<br>
were blocked by Republican actions.  The purpose of this count was an 
<br>
attempt to show that the Republicans disrupted the election.  The 
<br>
results did not pan out as expected, but the motive is as biased and 
<br>
unfair as I reported.  The unfair characterization is actually the 
<br>
true reason this subset of the recount was performed.
<br>
<p>The rest of your analysis, which I snipped for space, is absolutely 
<br>
correct.  I gave the Democrat-biased viewpoint as being the motive 
<br>
for the media-sponsored recount.  You gave the Republican-biased 
<br>
viewpoint as to why they organized their protest.  I agree 100% with 
<br>
your interpretation for the Republican viewpoint.  As usual, I 
<br>
believe both sides really believed in their viewpoint, and both 
<br>
motives really were root causes for this clash as it occurrred.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I could be equally one-sided and say, &quot;They wanted to find out if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the specific disruption caused by Democrat staff members flying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Miami to convince their operatives to change the rules - after the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vote took place - had an effect on the election.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You could say that, and it would be accurate from one side's 
<br>
viewpoint.  Howeer, it wouldn't explain the media's purpose for the 
<br>
article, which is what I was explaining.  The media was not really 
<br>
trying to prove that the democrats screwed up.  I really think that 
<br>
they were suprised at the result of this particular recount.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, the article also factored in the results of the recounts in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other counties that Gore's team had requested.  This particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;subset&quot; is the subset of what would have happened if Gore had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gotten everything he asked for.  Following the rules of the election 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plus some rule bending just for Gore, Bush still won.  It's a rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant view of the data to be rhetorically denigrated as just a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;subset&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>On an unrelated point, I think it is unimportant to figure out what 
<br>
subset would have been counted by Gore's request or Bush's requests. 
<br>
I think the important number is really the total number of people who 
<br>
voted for each candidate.  Any subset of recounts or counties or 
<br>
requests is really irrelevant to the purpose of the election.  Who 
<br>
did the majority of the people really vote for?  (Again, this is an 
<br>
unrelated point and does not dispute your valid point.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Oh, we'll never know a precise count.  Even if we count all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;votes in all the counties, what do we do about the 1,200 felony 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;votes that are in there?  What do we do about all of the multiple 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;votes?
</em><br>
<p>This is a real concern.  There are so many random factors and 
<br>
problems with our election system that there never will be a clear 
<br>
answer as to who won.  I think the loss of faith in the system 
<br>
(deservedly so!) is the real victim here.  There were so many ways 
<br>
that various votes were wrong, that the margin of error just cannot 
<br>
pick a president within a 5% error rate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The whole thing was a big nasty mess, and the actual count has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one-way hashed.  We'll never find out what would have happened if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the voting system had been perfectly fair.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Arguing that we'll ever have anything *but* &quot;guesses&quot; is nothing but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an exercise in baseless speculation where everyone will see what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they want to see.  As usual, history will depend upon who writes the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history books.  The facts are gone forever.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this, mostly.  However, I do think that recording the 
<br>
actual ballots is possible.  We can record how many people got turned 
<br>
away, how many felons voted, how many votes counted, how many votes 
<br>
didn't count, how many votes were dimpled/hanging/etc., and we will 
<br>
get a complete catalog of what happened.  Even with a clear picture 
<br>
of what happened, we won't have a good scheme to decide who should be 
<br>
president based on what happened.  What do you do if a voter is 
<br>
unfairy turned away?  What do you do if a vote is technally illegal 
<br>
but still discernable?  What do you do if a vote is 60%-40% estimated 
<br>
to go one way?  What do you do if there isn't enough time to count 
<br>
the votes?
<br>
<p>The real problem is not determining what happened.  I think a huge 
<br>
mass of records will be generated to documnt what happened with each 
<br>
and every ballot.  The real question is how to interpret these 
<br>
happenings and how to apply them to the election process.  It appears 
<br>
that reality does not present us with clear votes.  We don't have a 
<br>
fuzzy-logic system for voting, so nobody knows what to do.
