<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; I have to say I don't really understand this paranoia of yours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Its not paranoia when it actually happens to many people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I apologize if I was teasing too far. I don't know what actually happens in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your country, other than that I constantly watch your films, news and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk-shows and read your newspapers. Yes well, basically, these are the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources of information that you have - but still, I believe you scrutinize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts like these much more carefully than I do.
</em><br>
<p>Most of our mainstream press is hopelessly oriented toward promoting the
<br>
propaganda of the fasco-leftist agenda. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Note to Michael: please make sure to read the second half of the message. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am looking forward to your rebuttal regarding what I found your statistics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be. Hint: 'made up' would be a very kind expression for what you tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pull off.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Yes, I understand this was also the case in 1938 in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; countries. Lets see, you are in Slovenia, according to whois.net,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; which is a former Yugoslav republic. Hmmmm, no, I'm sure every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; person killed in your country definitely needed to be killed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, in 1945, the socialist government killed mercilessly thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who weren't friends with the new forces that be. Later on, they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quick to brand you as an &quot;enemy of the state&quot; if you showed the least sign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a liberal outlook on life, and they put you away to &quot;Naked Island&quot;, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small island in the Adriatic. Just a couple of hundred meters from shore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but incredibly difficult to escape from because of the strong currents. Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people spent decades on that island, and many more died there, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; No european nation has any right to claim they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; in any way more peaceful or safer. The odds of a european
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; dying from gun fire is about a hundred times higher than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; for any American.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to hear where you got these numbers from, and what part of Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they refer to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had some difficulty verifying your claims. I visited the website of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ministry for Internal Affairs, and they say we had something less than 200
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminal acts involving arms in 1998. That translates to 0.0001 such act per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen per year. The number of such criminal acts involving firearms (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arms in general) should be significantly lower.
</em><br>
<p>In terms of lifetime risk of death, with the average life expectancy of
<br>
75+ years, this means that in the last lifetime, there have been at
<br>
least 100 million innocent people killed by violent means (WWII, Stalins
<br>
purges before, during, and after the war, the Greek civil war, the
<br>
ongoing Yugoslavian conflicts, etc). At least half of these are due to
<br>
gunfire directly, if not as many as 3/4 (even the majority of Jews
<br>
executed were shot rather than gassed). In the US in the same time,
<br>
there has been an average of 8000-10,000 innocent people killed by
<br>
firearms by other people each year. This is 600,000-750,000 innocent
<br>
people killed in the same time period. Multiply by 100, and that comes
<br>
to 60-75 million people, which matches the gunfire deaths in europe in
<br>
the same time period.
<br>
<p>Now, you'll say &quot;But that was a war&quot;. So what? Those wars were caused by
<br>
countries that were fascist/socialist dictatorships that had been
<br>
brought to power by the common people who allowed themselves to be
<br>
conned into believing that they should give up their rights to self
<br>
defense, then those governments invaded other countries inhabited by
<br>
people who had been conned into beleiving socialist party arguments that
<br>
they should give up their right to self defense. There has never been a
<br>
case of a republic of freely armed individuals being defeated by an
<br>
equally sized dictatorship. Such nations are only defeated from within,
<br>
by destroying the common trust of the individual's ability to handle
<br>
their liberty responsibly. Dictatorships and socialist nations (i.e. all
<br>
of europe, except for Switzerland) cannot seem to go more than two or
<br>
three generations without either revolution or war or widespread
<br>
government murder of dissidents.
<br>
<p>It is not a mistake that the socialist partisans here in the US are the
<br>
biggest supporters of gun control. They know so long as private gun
<br>
ownership exists, they can never fully implement their plans.
