<p>I could say many unkind things about Sun and about Oracle personally as
<br>
well as some good things.  I can even say some good things about MS (and
<br>
have).  But that doesn't mean that I can draw no valid conclusions about
<br>
MS being predominantly a negative force in the software landscape.  Its
<br>
size and practices make it arguably a strong enough influence to be
<br>
singled out a bit.
<br>
<p>This doesn't mean that the others are all good.  Far from it.  
<br>
<p>As for the supposed gulf between programmers and actual users, I have no
<br>
idea how this enters into the topic.  I am both a programmer and a user
<br>
on multiple levels in software. This is more false dichotomy. 
<br>
Programmers are the consumers of development tools so naturally we would
<br>
have the most to say (good or ill) about such tools.  Those of us who
<br>
also are knowledgeable about building such tools can speak about them
<br>
even more deeply. We are also the ones that pay for these tools both
<br>
financially and in whatever we end up having to go through attempting to
<br>
use them.  If you want to distrust programmers about development tools
<br>
then you are distrusting the feedback of the users of such tools.  On
<br>
the other hand, if you want to get a valid opinion about programming
<br>
practices you should ask someone engaged in such practices.
