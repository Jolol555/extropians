<p>
Max:
<br>
<p>I sent the Extropy Institute a hard copy of a letter I sent to 24-Hour
<br>
Fitness.
<br>
<p>Basically it's a little staged publicity stunt gimmick to get a
<br>
&quot;fodder-for-discussion&quot; story going about when an &quot;order&quot; from a police
<br>
officer is a &quot;lawful order.&quot;
<br>
<p>Basically, the Nazi's claimed they were just &quot;following orders&quot; when they
<br>
killed the Jews.
<br>
<p>Is it always necessary to do what a police officers says without questioning
<br>
his authority?
<br>
<p>If an officer decides he wants to arrest you, do you have the option of
<br>
peacefully refusing, or insisting not to be handcuffed?
<br>
<p>What if you're outside of a movie theater smoking a joint, and they come up
<br>
and tell you you're under arrest and ask you to put your hands behind your
<br>
back?  Is that a &quot;LAWFUL&quot; order?
<br>
<p>My first home was:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111 Mizar Place
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lompoc, CA  93436
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(805) 733-1493
<br>
<p>My father still lives there.
<br>
<p>You'll see that the street next to it is called &quot;Alcor.&quot;  This is an
<br>
interesting coincidence, since I still wear an Alcor medic alert.  Although
<br>
I must confess (forgive the Catholic memesets), I have been unable to pay my
<br>
financial dues.
<br>
<p>Maybe someone out there would pay for my suspension fees as an act of
<br>
charity.  I'm sure there are things I can do to help them in a sort of
<br>
win/win.  I'm pretty close to a Libertarian, and not to attached to this or
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>Now is a good time to begin pushing the limits.  The network is in place.
<br>
The Libertarians are now equipped with the tools required to conduct free
<br>
trade and free speech (the internet).  Let's push some limits and see if we
<br>
can get a little tolerance meme virus to spread a little.
<br>
<p>It also contains a CD of some of the files on my website, and MPEG2 version
<br>
of my first Adobe Premiere project.  It's an amateur effort, but at least
<br>
its broadcast quality.  Also included a Digital Video Cassette and some
<br>
rolling papers and &quot;Big Red&quot; chewing gum just for &quot;shitz and grins&quot; (kicks).
<br>
<p>Please at least watch the 14 minute video and pick it apart if you want to.
<br>
It's your property, yours to keep or copy or destroy.
<br>
<p>As they say in SCENARIO PLANNING, it's a &quot;POINT OF DEPARTURE.&quot;
