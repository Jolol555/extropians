<p>I thought dis since you would be inhibiting the development, but I

understand the micro too. &lt;shudder&gt;

<p><em>&gt;You don't have to even operate a clandestine animal research

<p>One of the saddest things I ever saw was an ethnography film about
<br>
a little girl that had been raised in a cage in a cold dark
<br>
basement by uncaring parents. Then she had the misfortune to be
<br>
raised in the household of a psychologist called in when she was
<br>
discovered (for &quot;study&quot;).
<br>
<p>After the grant money for his hands-off study ran out she ended up
<br>
in a series of foster homes where she suffered other indignities.
<br>
I will never forget her face as the barely literate adolescent
<br>
tried to describe the things that happened to her.
<br>
<p>My fists clench and unclench at the thought, and I feel rage wash
<br>
through me when I think about it. The parents would face worse at
<br>
my hands, and that psychologist would be in for major attitude
<br>
adjusting as well.
<br>
<p>Time to meditate...
