</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined by?
</em><br>
<p>Without commenting directly on your question (I'll let Charlie do that, he
<br>
seems to be better at it :-), I would like to remind everyone of one thing:
<br>
<p>This argument started from the original disagreement of whether or not it is
<br>
good if people do this-or-that. Specifically, it started after some people
<br>
asserted that &quot;doing this-or-that is a human being's natural right&quot;. In
<br>
other words, they erected their own interpretation of what the &quot;optimum set
<br>
of rules for a human society&quot; should be, and then they postulated that their
<br>
set of rules is the only correct set of rules because there is only one
<br>
optimum set of rules. Obviously, since there is only one optimum set of
<br>
rules, *their's* is undebatably the one.
<br>
<p>We may eventually agree that there is only one optimum set of rules for a
<br>
human society. But that doesn't mean a thing; we will still be disagreeing
<br>
on what, exactly, that optimum set of rules *actually is*. In other words,
<br>
there may be only one such set of rules, but that doesn't by far imply that
<br>
anyone on this earth has even the slightest idea of what it is.
<br>
<p>As long as we humans are on the level of inteligence where we currently are,
<br>
I find it difficult to accept that anyone's, or any group's, preferred set
<br>
of rules is actually *the* optimum set of rules.
<br>
<p>Until now, Samantha and Michael (and perhaps others?) have been unable to
<br>
show why America's preferred set of rules is necessarily *the* optimum set
<br>
of rules for a human society. I don't think that they will ever be able to
<br>
show that, because it most probably isn't true. They might be able to show
<br>
that America's set of rules makes perfect sense; but this is *not*
<br>
equivalent to showing that it is the optimum set of rules.
<br>
<p>This is why I originally claimed something similar to the following: it
<br>
doesn't really matter whether there is an optimum set of rules and what it
<br>
is derived from, because we cannot *know* what it is. In particular, *no
<br>
one* can assert that *they*, perhaps by virtue of some divine insight,
<br>
posess knowledge to the optimum set of rules.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, such assertions (&quot;but that is *unnatural*!&quot;, &quot;but that is a
<br>
*basic human right*!&quot;) are not at all uncommon, even on this list.
<br>
<p>Disagreements of whether or not it is good if people do this-or-that have to
<br>
be discussed on the merits of arguments, not assertions. If 'human rights'
<br>
are to be used as an argument rather than an assertion, we must first
<br>
establish a common set of rules that we all find acceptable. If such an
<br>
agreement is not reached, there is no way 'human rights' can be used as an
<br>
argument.
