<p>Admittedly it will be extremely difficult.  The single lander must
<br>
carry a nuclear reactor and some advanced robotics that can
<br>
do much of the building autonomously.  The human cargo is
<br>
there only to guide, advise and repair the robots, not really to
<br>
operate them like an earthbound crane operator.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Almost everything it needs for quite
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  The launch costs are just too high, and it is too
<br>
difficult to hit a precise target on the red planet.  Recall that
<br>
will current technologies, we can only hit within a few score km
<br>
CEP, and even then the softlanded payloads are extremely small
<br>
even assuming a large launch vehicle.  With current technology
<br>
[which we must use if we are to get a human presence on Mars
<br>
before nanotech] the colonist can expect no hardware from home.
<br>
Plenty of advice and software, but no materials.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Especially in manufactured objects.  Or do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think you re going to get enough people to run an economy...
</em><br>
<p>Run an economy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...to manufacture everything you need...
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not everything you *want*.  But perhaps everything
<br>
you *need*.  Of course we may redefine the term need.  Ma
<br>
Joad had everything she really needed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (or enough robotics) immediately in the first shot?
</em><br>
<p>First shot, only shot.  Thats our only shot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But people who are poor, uneducated, unhealthy, etc, do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get these chances.  This competition is open to *everyone*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it is not.  You are going to need highly competent and intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in such extreme and remote conditions.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  But the way we define intelligence may need some
<br>
adjustment.  Those who currently survive in remote areas with
<br>
little help from modern technology, such as Aboriginees, are
<br>
a prime example of those who I consider highly intelligent in
<br>
those areas that are needed for survival.  We need not a
<br>
Captain America type who did well in school, threw great
<br>
parties, etc, but who would likely wilt like a spring flower
<br>
at strange new challenges.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A mere baby machine, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some have proposed will not do at all.
</em><br>
<p>How do you know?  A baby machine might be just the thing.
<br>
Ma Joad was a baby machine.  But when the going really got
<br>
tough, the men gave up, did they not?  I know that Grapes of
<br>
Wrath is fiction, but there is great truth in this.  Motherhood instinct!
<br>
When all the men gave up, she forged on with a fierce determination
<br>
that the others could not muster.  The mother of this family knew
<br>
that there was only one direction; FORWARD!  She understood
<br>
that there was no up to give, no back to turn, only FORWARD!
<br>
Struggle on until dead, thats the spirit we need to find.  It is here,
<br>
somewhere, on this planet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  When the needs are large,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources are low and risks are high you cannot afford not to send the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best.
</em><br>
<p>Im suggesting we send the very best.  Consider that those who
<br>
do not know the first thing about electronics can build intricate
<br>
computers.  I can take you to Lockheed and show you a room
<br>
full of employees, who are 95% women by the way, who have
<br>
no college education, but who read instructions and build the
<br>
most wonderful machines.  The Mars colonist is a pair of hands
<br>
and a mind, as well as a womb.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Nowthen, please, everyone here, stop and think hard: what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skills would *really* be *required* for an astronaut heading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to Mars to start a colony?  I suggest these:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1.  Determination to survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2.  Low weight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3.  Very small appetite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4.  Ability to endure loneliness, but with the complementary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ability to endure more virtual &quot;company&quot; than one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibly imagine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5.  Functional uterus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 6.  Collection of frozen embryos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is idiotic.  What are these children supposed to survive on?
</em><br>
<p>The first colonist must have equipment with which to build tunnels.
<br>
Then she must set up artificial lighting.  This is the equipment that
<br>
must be brought from home.  The lighting is powered by a nuclear
<br>
reactor that is also brought from home.  That tunnel is pressurized
<br>
and food crops are grown therein.  I never said this would be easy.
<br>
See item 1 above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By whom are they educated and cared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for?  By one great uterus woman picked mainly for that and low weight?
</em><br>
<p>You guessed it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And what if anything at all goes wrong in the decade and a half or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that these children are not productive or dependable?  Give me a break.
</em><br>
<p>Break granted.  These children must become competent farmers in far
<br>
less than the decade and a half we allow our overindulged extended-
<br>
childhood offspring.  Many societies have shown that if circumstances
<br>
demand it, children can grow up fast.  These circumstances demand it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1.  Education (why would that be needed?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sigh. For dealing with all the very complex things that can and are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to go wrong.
</em><br>
<p>*They* will educate *us* in how to survive on Mars.  Little else
<br>
matters to them.  Of course we could send software to help operate
<br>
the robots.  The only education the first generation of Martians
<br>
can use is how to fix machines.  This is often more an instict than
<br>
a learned skill.  I suspect most of what we could teach them would
<br>
be useless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2.  Social graces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ever tried to live with dozens of children in very tight (not to mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous and hostile) quarters?
</em><br>
<p>Im not saying it would be easy or fun.  {8^D  I do not envision
<br>
dozens of children either.  Four or five perhaps, spaced a
<br>
Martian year apart might be doable.  Humans have survived
<br>
worse situations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3.  Literacy (the messages could be translated to and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from voice.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, right.  What about educating the children?
</em><br>
<p>Educating them in what?  See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  All done by learning machines we don't have?
</em><br>
<p>Machines we *do* have.  The DVD player would be
<br>
an extremely useful tool.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 5.  Legs  (Where is she gonna go?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry.  I am getting taken in.  This is obviously sick parody.
</em><br>
<p>Well parody.  In a 1/3 G field, two good arms would be amply
<br>
sufficient for all necessary motion.  Furthermore, in the 8 month
<br>
trip in weighlessness, the large leg bones dump calcium which
<br>
must be taken up and eliminated by the kidneys.  Legs take
<br>
up room and use up calories.  Im not suggesting amputating
<br>
good legs.  There are some good candidates who dont have legs,
<br>
such as those in war-torn countries who have trod upon land-
<br>
mines or suffered from SB or polio.  These would get around
<br>
on Mars better than they can hers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would communication from an illterate cunt (since that is all you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are allowing)  and a pack of wild infants and ill-educated children from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of miles away at hideous cost be worth anything at all to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone?
</em><br>
<p>I prefer to think of her as a *possibly illiterate* womb.  Have you
<br>
ever heard of a children's story called Island of the Blue Dolphins?
<br>
Fictional account by Scott Odell, based on a true story of an
<br>
illiterate girl who was left alone for years on an island.  Millions
<br>
of kids have read it.  Its an inspirational story.  When the missionaries
<br>
found her in 1810, she had invented a number of clever survival
<br>
technologies.  Nowthen, she may be illiterate, but she must be
<br>
able to communicate ideas of course, even technical ones to
<br>
some extent, in order that ground-based engineers may understand
<br>
the situation and advise.
<br>
<p>I had in mind an ideal candidate may well be Chinese or Indian,
<br>
since that constitutes half the world's population, as well as the
<br>
fact that people from there are not as likely to be luxury-spoiled
<br>
lap-dogs as we westerners can sometimes be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK.  Say we find 10 million similarly bored and twisted people.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, this world contains a lot of bored twisted people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  That is $400 million a year.
</em><br>
<p>I would think 400 million a month, at least at first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The cost of the shot to put this thing on Mars is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around $50-100 billion minimum.
</em><br>
<p>No.  With that kinda money, we need not go for all the Spartan
<br>
heroic measures.  50-100 gigabucks is a NASA style mission.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The cost of food, air, heat and so on
</em><br>
<p>Food must be grown there.  Air must be extracted from the
<br>
atmosphere there.  Heat must be made there with a small
<br>
nuclear reactor, such as the one the Russians have developed
<br>
for space use.  Structures must be built from materials there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...utterly foolproof so said stupid cunt
</em><br>
<p>Smart womb, please.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and her brats can't screw it up
</em><br>
<p>Her well-disciplined Martian offspring, please.
<br>
<p>The Russian nuclear reactor does not require constant attention.
<br>
The challenge is to get enough solar collectors built in the few
<br>
years that the nuke fuel lasts, in order to take over.  Im not saying
<br>
it would be easy.  But possible, and advisable, before nanotech.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is impossible and too silly a parody to even be amusing.
