<em>&gt; I guess I will have to chip in with Eugene here. I cannot think of one

<em>&gt; product that I as a developer havn't seen better elsewhere. But I am forced
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I use NT 4.0 and primarily Ventura from Corel. Ventura 7 was buggy, and
<br>
the publications I inherited from my predecessor were also full of
<br>
structural and layout errors that contributed to Ventura's instability.
<br>
Once I put in the work to fix the publications, and upgraded to Ventura
<br>
8, I have been extremely happy with both NT and Ventura. I run NT for
<br>
weeks at a time with no problems, and I maintain an 1800 page software
<br>
manual in Ventura with over 4000 graphics and 12,000 index entries in 39
<br>
chapters which I publish to hardcopy, PDF and HTML on a quarterly basis,
<br>
on the web and on CD-ROM. I do not get crashes from Ventura or NT. I
<br>
have experience publishing with Mac/Adobe/Quark software, and can
<br>
rightly tell elitists who think they know better that they've got their
<br>
heads rammed somewhere if they think that Mac in any way can compete in
<br>
DTP today. The closest Adobe can come is FrameMaker, which is buggy and
<br>
tech support stinks. The other applications I use primarily besides
<br>
Ventura are Corel Draw, Corel Photo-Paint, EditPlus for HTML, perl and
<br>
java coding, and Netscape. Netscape is the most unstable application,
<br>
which primarily occurs when Windows Explorer is up and running.
<br>
<p>That being said, I just wasted my morning fixing coworkers computers
<br>
that had been hit by the 'Spirale' email/web virus (it places a large
<br>
spinning black and white spiral animation in front of everything on your
<br>
screen, then emails itself through Outlook to your buddies). The idiots.
<br>
I use netscape mail.
<br>
