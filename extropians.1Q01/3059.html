<p>Okay, so the cameras are more impersonal than cops in a small town. 
<br>
They still give law enforcement an advantage that I'm not sure they 
<br>
shouldn't have.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; &gt;But there's something wrong with all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;pictures. A society that needs that sort of observation of its members in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Uh... Yes?  Are you saying that our society lacks structural flaws?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  A society that needs *any* observation of its members in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  enforce its rules must have some structural flaws - it's just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  matter of minimizing the impact of those flaws upon the law-abiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  members of our society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think it structural, its more a systemic failing, partly induced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by insufficient acclimatization of immigrants, partly induced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communalist tendencies and ideologies denigrating the individual.
</em><br>
<p>No real argument here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; Personally, I'm not satisfied with the safety level in our society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  In the last ten years or so, I've had my car stolen, my car broken
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  into and valuable items stolen, a friend who was mugged and slashed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in broad daylight downtown, etc.  Those issues are fresh in my mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and impact my life quite often - affecting where I go and what I do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Last time I was victimized by crime was when I was assaulted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Burlington Vermont by some acid-head picking a fight. The time before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that was when my truck was broken into in San Francisco. City events.
</em><br>
<p>My car was stolen from a nice little neighborhood in Sunnyvale, 
<br>
California.  I found it rather ironic when Sunnyvale was named the 
<br>
&quot;Safest City in the Country&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; To contrast that, I've never had law enforcement agents take my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  property or make me feel like I might lose my life.  I can't think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  any friends or friends of friends who've had serious encounters with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  law enforcement that they didn't bring upon themselves.  I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  always enamored with policemen.  Sometimes they can be a bit haughty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  but give me an asshole cop writing me a ticket versus someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  stealing my car from IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE any day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tell me: how many of the crimes you cite have actually been investigated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and/or solved?
</em><br>
<p>They found my car about a week later down in San Jose, stripped. 
<br>
Does that count?  There happened to be cops nearby when my friend got 
<br>
mugged, and they caught 3 of the 5 guys involved.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  I'll bet none of them. The break-in in SF that happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to me was never solved, not that they actually put much effort into it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(the guy who assaulted me got busted because he was so high that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flagged down the cop for me ;-)). I'll bet if you had used a gun to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;restrain the guy who stole your car, you'd have been arrested for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brandishing and assault with a deadly weapon.
</em><br>
<p>I felt so extremely violated by having my car stolen.  I didn't have 
<br>
much savings yet, I didn't have theft insurance (playing the odds... 
<br>
lost), I couldn't get to work without my car, I was going to have to 
<br>
go into debt to replace it with something crappy.  I'm probably lucky 
<br>
that I didn't have an opportunity to point a gun at the guy who stole 
<br>
my car, especially since I was living in California.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
