<p>Sure. Plenty, but how many kids did they have???
<br>
<p>However, most of them were raised in a day and age when you didn't need
<br>
a law degree to be a practicing lawyer, an engineering degree to design
<br>
and build bridges, mills, and ships, and the concept of the MBA was a
<br>
mere gleam in the eyes of university provosts.
<br>
<p>Most such individuals were home schooled, in fact, and frankly I'd pit a
<br>
kid with a 6th grade education from 1920 against a current day high
<br>
school graduate (or college graduate, even, depending on the college and
<br>
major).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My grandmother was one such person, she dropped out of school after 6th
<br>
grade to raise her 8 brothers and sisters when her mother died (her
<br>
father was an unemployed alcoholic). She worked as a seamstress and maid
<br>
in some rich person's mansion, then as a beautician, then she met my
<br>
grandfather who became a publishing executive. She never went back to
<br>
school, but was the New England Scrabble champion, president of the New
<br>
Hampshire Floral Association, and best of all, taught me to read at age
<br>
four. She was one tough cookie, a terror to my mother. If she had chosen
<br>
to go into business I am sure she would have been the epitome of the
<br>
'brass balled bitch' type of female executive and would have fit just
<br>
fine into any Rand or Heinlein novel. She was a very self confident and
<br>
self aware person who read voraciously her entire life (and not romance
<br>
novel crap either). She had three kids, which was pretty below average
<br>
for 1940.
