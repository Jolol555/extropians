In the debate about judging each individual situation, versus applying a set 
<br>
of principles to every, I think everyone is making a mistake about what 
<br>
these two things mean. They're really the same thing.
<br>
When presented with a new situation, you have to apply principles to see how 
<br>
to deal with it. Even if those principles are made up on the spot. Even if 
<br>
the principle is &quot;I will flip a coin to decide&quot; or &quot;I will act impulsively 
<br>
and do whatever comes most naturally&quot;. Even nihilism is a set of principles.
<br>
Suppose you hold the principle that theft is wrong. Then, you find yourself 
<br>
starving and walking past an apple orchard. You sneak over the fence, and 
<br>
take an apple. Have you set principles aside, in favor of judging the 
<br>
individual situation? To even put it this way would show that you don't 
<br>
understand the structure of decision making. You have applied principles 
<br>
here and acted on them. The principles may be that hunger overrides all 
<br>
other principles, or that survival is the most important thing. A principles 
<br>
used here might have also been that it is only wrong to steal that which is 
<br>
highly valued (if you'd stole the apple from a starving person with only one 
<br>
apple, it would have violated these principles, but a farmer with millions 
<br>
of apples would be ok). Or, maybe the principle was that it's only wrong to 
<br>
steal if you're going to get caught. These principles may have been revised 
<br>
on the spot from your original principle about theft, but my overall point 
<br>
is that these lower-level considerations which go into &quot;judging each 
<br>
situation individually&quot; ARE principles.
