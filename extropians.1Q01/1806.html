<p>Eliezer,
<br>
<p>With all (considerable) due respect, has it occurred to you that others
<br>
may be able to make an intelligent evaluation of risks for themselves? 
<br>
This is the second such post I've seen from you and I'm frankly
<br>
beginning to wonder if you are not just a tad paranoid.  Treating people
<br>
that do not get it with a little respect and pointing them to
<br>
information sources is not the same as simply painting a big target on
<br>
said sources of information.  If you want to be paranoid then I suggest
<br>
you immediately heavily encrypt all of your writings and posts as the
<br>
WEB and email are notoriously open to all who might want to read it. 
<br>
Only give out the keys to your encrypted information to those who have
<br>
been triply verified and vouched for as true goodniks serving the cause
<br>
of Friendliness.
