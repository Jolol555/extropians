<p>
Apologies for the length and perhaps the self-indulgence of this post. I've
<br>
been gathering some of my old articles and reviews, and I rather liked this
<br>
one written when Halley's Comet was in the offing. It appeared in a garbled
<br>
form in *Vogue Australia* 15 or 16 years ago. I've now recast my prediction
<br>
of Halley's comet's dimness  into past tense, but left the wrong prediction
<br>
that Hale-Bopp would be brighter.
<br>
<p>=====================================
<br>
<p><p>When I was quite small, I read about comets in a children's encyclopaedia.
<br>
My heart stopped, and then pounded. How can the world be prosaic, in a
<br>
universe where comets tear without much warning (or stranger still, with
<br>
clock-like reliability) out of the deep and innocent sky? There was a photo
<br>
of Halley's comet, pale hair stretched across the stars. It was pure beauty.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hairy stars! Tresses of light, blown by the Sun's bright wind! Mad
<br>
portents, death and ruin of kings (but today most of us democrats have no
<br>
kings, thank God, or, some of us, gods either, ditto), oracles written on
<br>
the black sky in scratchings of brightness, fogs fleeing from the icy ends
<br>
of the solar system to the warmth of our inner star, dirty iceballs of
<br>
chemical smut and smog (and--who knows? certainly not that kid stuck back
<br>
there in the fifties--alien DNA, genes, disease, life from space!) locked
<br>
up in a hazy, lovely wisp of lace: kometes, yes, the comet! guest star from
<br>
the boundaries of night, jog-plodding out there beyond Neptune and Pluto at
<br>
a measly kilometre a second, then racing like a mad hatless 19th century
<br>
schoolgirl with her hair all tossed and freed in the hot summer wind to
<br>
round the sky and hide behind the Sun and dash past the world as we craned
<br>
back our heads, peering at--what! where is it? give me the binoculars, the
<br>
damned thing's too dim...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Halley's comet was a blow-out, I regret to say, in April, 1986, its
<br>
nearest approach to Earth orbit. A bust, a non-event. Well, almost...
<br>
Parents perched their kids on tired shoulders, pointing without much
<br>
conviction at the dull patch. Pretty feeble, the faintest apparition in the
<br>
last two thousand years of triumphant Halley returns to the inner solar
<br>
system stage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How angry I would have been, three decades earlier in the mid-fifties
<br>
(Halley having hit aphelion--farthest point from the sun--four years after
<br>
my birth, yes, the year Orwell was getting down his dreadful vision of our
<br>
future era). Thirty-five times farther again out than Earth, and it takes
<br>
zippy light eight minutes to reach our neighbourly orbit. How angry I'd
<br>
have been to know how faint and difficult the rotten thing was to be in
<br>
that year of grace and light, 1986, when I turned 42.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was waiting patiently all that time, you see, a faithful devotee of
<br>
galaxies and comets. Child's heart pounding (this was years before sex, but
<br>
still...) I gazed besotted at the glowing portrait of M31 in Andromeda,
<br>
that wondrous whirlpool of a hundred billion great hot stars they called a
<br>
Nebula, then, in that old borrowed encyclopaedia volume. The scientists,
<br>
the dreadful Darwinists and Doubters, hadn't yet tumbled, in the world of
<br>
that volume (that lost past of my grandparents' generation), to the horrid
<br>
immensity of the cosmos. They took our Milky Way galaxy for the only one in
<br>
town, they thought the furry nebulae were blotches and foams of gas at the
<br>
edge of the fairground.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we know better, of course. This little cosmos spread around our heads
<br>
is the merest grain of sand in a shoreline, an ocean of specks, still
<br>
blasting into a spacetime of its own making like the residue of a nuclear
<br>
fireball from the Big Bang origin somewhere back there 15 or 20 thousand
<br>
million years past. But when I was a kid, not all that long ago really in
<br>
cosmological or even historic terms, the available paperwork was woefully
<br>
out of date. The Gitas. The Holy Bible. The Qur'an. The Book of Mormon, for
<br>
that matter. You wouldn't want to jump-start a universe based on
<br>
documentation like that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, we're grateful for what we can get. For hours, in the mid-1950s, I
<br>
pressed my face to the glossy illustration pages in the Arthur Mees
<br>
encyclopaedia, the photographs from Mount Wilson with its fabulous
<br>
(pre-metric measurements) 100-inch telescope, all those heart-stirring
<br>
records from just the other day, 1910, when Halley's comet sent its fifty
<br>
million kilometre tail like a new Milky Way band of luminous gauze across
<br>
half the sky.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was coming back! That was the great thing. In 1985 or 1986, in the
<br>
impossible future, a future of adulthood (when you could buy all the
<br>
icecreams and lollies and jam biscuits you wished, and eat them one after
<br>
another, and no-one could tell you to stop!), Halley would return on its
<br>
elastic string of gravity, loop back like a cosmic yo-yo, picking up speed
<br>
and falling for the Sun, into the light, into the terrible heat and wind
<br>
from the Sun (though they didn't know about the wind then) (Wind! from the
<br>
Sun?!), and its dark insignificant cometary nucleus would hiss and steam
<br>
and breathe out light, light and bright dust, and the sky would open again
<br>
in its once-every-76-years apocalypse and apparition, like a contract
<br>
written by God attesting the Natural Human Span.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the great thing, but I had not realised how dim the damned thing
<br>
was going to be at this end of the century, or how much rubbish we'd have
<br>
thrown up into the sky--street-light rubbish, flashing neon sign rubbish,
<br>
let alone the micro-muck spattered through the air we try to work our
<br>
cigarette-damaged lungs with.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great thing, by contrast, about being Ancient Man (3000 B.C., say),
<br>
was that you had (a) no television, theatre or movies to distract you at
<br>
night, (b) no good restaurants to go out to, and (c) no electric lights, a
<br>
drawback by some standards but okay at the time, due to a lack of (d) any
<br>
amusing reading matter, but then (e), don't forget, no reliable
<br>
contraceptives, and on top of all that you probably had (f) plenty of
<br>
flocks to watch all night. How you actually kept an eye on your flocks with
<br>
no electric power is anyone's guess.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must have been a wonderful sameness about it, for all that, rolled
<br>
in your cloak, the fire fallen into embers, gazing up at the endlessly
<br>
turning sky choked with stars too dim for our city-stunned eyes to capture.
<br>
(Wilfred Thesiger, that mad Briton who went among the wild desert men of
<br>
Arabia Deserta early in our century, met youths with sight so piercing they
<br>
could make out the circling moons of Jupiter, unknown to urban folk until
<br>
the invention of the telescope.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the uninterpreted heavens tell a single story, that tale is
<br>
Stability and Order. Now we know the sky is a shrieking chaos of exploding
<br>
quasars and flickering giant suns, imploding black holes and moon-cracking
<br>
asteroids. Then, though, all was peace, and the planets wandered to and fro
<br>
on their crystalline spheres, attended by the orbiting sun and moon,
<br>
speaking from eternity and earliest human history a corrupting, soothing
<br>
fable of Kingly Ordination: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observe degree, priority and place,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office and custom,
<br>
<p>reported William Shakespeare, from a limb of revolution in history and
<br>
astronomy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at spastic intervals the calm clockwork of the night ruptured without
<br>
warning, and surely nothing could more easily set you screaming in panic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new star! Nova! (In fact, an old star blowing its top, as five billion
<br>
years ago a nearby big fat blue star went off the deep end and sent a shock
<br>
wave through a mess of cosmic dust and rubble, compressing it in pulses of
<br>
radiation, causing it to clump and fall together into cold lumps that
<br>
warmed themselves, and so started our Sun and ourselves...)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a star might erupt, burning for days or weeks like a god's eye, and
<br>
other stars tumble routinely to flare and streak (the meteors and their
<br>
metallic residues the meteorites, accepted by shepherds but mocked until
<br>
the end of the 18th century by savants who found them an affront to `form,
<br>
office and custom'), what might we make of comets, smashing like mad golf
<br>
balls through the stained-glass windows of the manse, through the crystal
<br>
spheres of church and state in the ordained macrocosm above our
<br>
corruptible, sublunary heads?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, this was Revolution! Unthinkable! Omens and portents, yes, and foul
<br>
vapours, and pestilence from a broken promise of utter peace in the skies
<br>
above the clouds!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese astrologers suspected dragons, and recorded the comets faithfully
<br>
from the second millennium BC. Two of them, drunk as skunks, missed an
<br>
eclipse and lost their heads to imperial wrath, smartening up the rest of
<br>
their guild. Halley itself is recorded on almost every fly-by at least back
<br>
to 87 BC, and records of bright comets in 240 and 467 BC look familiar. But
<br>
it wasn't until Edmond Halley nudged his chum Newton at the end of the 17th
<br>
century for a clue to Universal Gravitation that these historical
<br>
annotations (some of them, anyway) fell beautifully into an elliptical
<br>
graph tracking the comet of 1682 backward and forward through time and
<br>
space. `I would venture confidently to predict its return,' quoth Halley in
<br>
1705, `namely in the year 1758.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legerdemain! A new order of regularity in the heavens, a fresh system, as
<br>
lovely, as elegant, as unexpected as finding that the dinosaurs were wiped
<br>
out to the last man when the nucleus of an exhausted comet smote the Earth
<br>
in the year 65,000,000 BC (roughly), an instant-winter effect we very
<br>
nearly replicated, and maybe came within a hair of doing so, before the
<br>
Evil Empire corroded through, had we decided to `fight' a nuclear `war'.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolution? Why, yes. Where did you suppose the word came from? Copernicus
<br>
had given everyone a nasty turn with his revelation of Revolutions of the
<br>
Heavenly Bodies, and the Renaissance took up his insight as a metaphor, the
<br>
collapse of old before the thrust of new, the power of the stars (of
<br>
course) impelling the rise of the brash and the strong. Halley's, however,
<br>
is a Counter-Revolutionary, for the fool thing swings in a reverse sense
<br>
about the Sun, counter-clockwise, heading left as we swing right, so people
<br>
in high places need have no fear. Maybe. For there are other comets (of
<br>
course). Hale-Bopp, say, in April 1997, three times as large, brighter in
<br>
the southern sky than Halley.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly Halley's owned a rich, peculiar stink of mystery: trapped in
<br>
gold and thread by Giotto and the Bayeux weavers, ripe with spores of
<br>
universal life, if astronomers Hoyle and Wickramasinghe are right, and not
<br>
just life but disease and genetic benefice, gifts of Magi and Wicked Witch
<br>
in silvery wrapping. There's more. Consider American gothic novelist John
<br>
Calvin Batchelor's troubling assessment of that singular moment of the
<br>
hairy comet:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Man's hunger, working in conjunction with his bizarre yen for profit, had
<br>
moved him from a fire in a cave on an antediluvian river shore eight
<br>
millennia before the birth of the Saviour, to a fire on a volcanic plain on
<br>
the moon two millennia after... The instant in time that Homo sapiens
<br>
touched lunar soil, Earthman became Spaceman, from which there is no
<br>
turning back. Good riddance to all that. Hello to high, wide, and hairy.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, hello to Hairy Stars! As the space probe Giotto plowed on March 14,
<br>
1986, through the fourteen kilometre coma, the glowing head of Halley's,
<br>
watched by the Russian Vega craft and a Japanese mission, as it sent back
<br>
its mysterious portraits, we too entered one step further into our estate.
<br>
Masters of the Universe! Spectators, at the very least. At best: its
<br>
reworkers, its next designers, the tenants who took over the cosmos and did
<br>
it up to their own tastes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nuclear winter? Global starvation? Resource depletion and entropy, a world
<br>
laid waste in the fecundity of its own most successful animal? Hell, no.
<br>
Hairy stars! Nebulae! Here's my advice: go with that kid I once was,
<br>
dreaming, in abstract love, into the encyclopaedia, as sweet a symbol as I
<br>
know for the burgeoning storehouse of human knowledge. And what we learn
<br>
will change what we know, drastically, convulsively, in ways we-- well, in
<br>
ways we cannot yet know. But we can make educated guesses. Sometimes--like
<br>
the smudgy thing I waited for during thirty years of devotion--our dreams
<br>
will prove wilder than the reality. It's the risk we run, we dreamers. But
<br>
more often than not, we see past the veil into a place (all right, call it
<br>
the future) where the prosaic and the workaday dare not step. Until
<br>
relentless time pushes them through, and they sprawl without preparation,
<br>
bruised and confused and angry. Hairy stars! Why didn't anyone warn us?
