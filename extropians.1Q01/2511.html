Charlie Stross asks,
<br>
<em>&gt; If you disagree with any of these memes, could you wave a hand and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain why?
</em><br>
<p>I'm going to be a bit nitpicky here, because these are complex issues
<br>
and seldom will a one-liner be completely true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. Forcing our fellow human beings to live their lives as we see fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    is unethical. (Persuading them of the error of their ways so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    they _choose_ to live their lives by our lights is another matter.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Initiating violence against someone is wrong; self-defense is right.
</em><br>
<p>These two contradict each other.  If someone wants to live their life in
<br>
such a way as to commit violence, and we make them stop, we are forcing
<br>
them to live their lives as we see fit.  We don't just try to persuade
<br>
them not to be violent, to help them see the error of their ways.  We
<br>
make them stop.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it is often difficult to distinguish what constitutes
<br>
initiation of violence from what is self-defense.  It is common in human
<br>
relations to see a gradual escalation of hostility between two sides.
<br>
Each side claims that they are responding in self-defense to the violence
<br>
initiated by the other.  In practice, each is guilty of a degree of
<br>
escalation.  But no one act in the chain can easily be singled out as
<br>
the initiation of violence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. The scientific method provides a better way of evaluating reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    than any religious dogma.
</em><br>
<p>True for today's religions, but not necessarily true in the future.
<br>
If God (or AI) came into existence and laid down His transcendental laws,
<br>
these might be a superior guide to the truth than the laborious task of
<br>
scientific investigation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4. Progress (increases in human intelligence, longevity, wealth, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    happiness) is possible.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; unfortunately reductions in these measures are also possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5. Central control is usually less efficient than distributed control.
</em><br>
<p>It depends on the situation, the transaction costs, the distribution
<br>
of information, etc.  We see firms under centralized control competing
<br>
with each other in a decentralized market.  There is a large body of
<br>
economics literature that analyzes when centralized vs decentralized
<br>
approaches are more efficient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6. Empowering people to learn, work, and transcend their limits is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    thing.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Empowering&quot; is a somewhat vague and loaded term.  It will not usually
<br>
be possible to &quot;empower&quot; someone without costs.  These costs must be
<br>
balanced against the gains.  For example, maybe it would be nice if
<br>
someone would &quot;empower&quot; me to go back to school for more education.
<br>
Fine, but who will support my family then?  And will the costs of the
<br>
absence of my productive efforts in society be less than the benefits
<br>
which my empowerment brings?
<br>
<p><p>I don't really disagree with all these points in the broadest terms.
<br>
As rules of thumb, or starting points in an analysis, they are reasonable.
<br>
But particulars matter.  Slogans are no substitute for dealing with the
<br>
complexity of the world.
<br>
<p>Hal
