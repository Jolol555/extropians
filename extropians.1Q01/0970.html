<p>Actually, I predict that this is not true.
<br>
<p>The new evidence that liquid water existed earlier than previously 
<br>
thought only came about because we hadn't found rocks that old 
<br>
before.  Once we found the older rocks and looked at them, we found 
<br>
the evidence of early water.
<br>
<p>I predict that the same is true of micro-fossils.  We haven't found 
<br>
them that old because we haven't found rocks that old before.  Once 
<br>
we find enough older rocks and look at them, I expect we will start 
<br>
finding older evidence of life, and will push back the origin of life 
<br>
about 400 million years also.
