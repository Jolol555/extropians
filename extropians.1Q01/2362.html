<p>My point was that at what level of symbiosis do multiple organisms become a 
<br>
single organism?  It is easy to conceive of symbiotic organisms that 
<br>
co-evolved to the point where they really couldn't survive without the 
<br>
other.  But even in cases of very close symbiosis, there are still two 
<br>
distinct organisms -- you can kill one without killing the other.  There is 
<br>
a fuzzy point where the boundary isn't clear, but human societies don't 
<br>
have any such fuzzy boundaries between individuals.
