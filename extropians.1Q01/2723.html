<em>&gt; &gt; There're some more possibilities you forgot, if you follow

<em>&gt; &gt; belts because sex before 17 violates the age of consent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Strip-search people every week to look for suspicious signs

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think laws generally tend to be too strict when they are difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce, so that they are easier to enforce in those cases when they *can*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be enforced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once technology develops to allow a law to be enforced more easily, the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself needs to be adapted. The assumption that something is difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce is usually designed into laws, so when this assumption stops being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true, the law needs to evolve consistently - in the spirit of what the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was originally meant to achieve, not in the spirit of what the letter of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law currently says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am looking forward towards a time when technology will enable us to limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves to good behavior by means of technology rather than by means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law. However, I fear that some dumbsters in charge won't realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing laws *do* need to be reconsidered and adapted once this takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place. If they are not, this could easily lead to an Orvellian society.
</em><br>
<p>What you describe WILL be an Orwellian society. Technological
<br>
feasibility of enforcement is not a justification to adopt a law. If it
<br>
were, we'd then have a Moore's Law of creeping fascism. Only a person
<br>
who has absolutely no trust in their fellow man would support such a
<br>
silly idea. Like any technology, a law is just a tool, it is not a 'good
<br>
thing' in and of itself, nor is the goal of controlling peoples behavior
<br>
in increasing amounts to be lauded as a positive goal of law
<br>
enforcement. Laws, in a free society, are supposed to exist to enhance,
<br>
not restrict, the utilization of our individual liberties to the maximum
<br>
extent possible for the most number of people, and to ensure that
<br>
everyone is able to exercise some minimum set of liberties. Only fascist
<br>
laws dictate the maximum liberty possible for everyone. Making it easier
<br>
to enforce such laws is not only not extropic, its not human or humane.
