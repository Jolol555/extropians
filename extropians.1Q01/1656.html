</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not two counterrotating wheels? Simpler mechanically...and as long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you equalize speeds, no gyroscopic effects to worry about.
</em><br>
<p>And if you put the two counterrotating wheels on a mount that could
<br>
spin in any direction (I forget the name for this - three circles
<br>
where the mount between one circle and the next, or between the
<br>
outermost circle and the outside world, allows spinning in one of the
<br>
three spin axis), then that would insure against any manufacturing
<br>
defects that did introduce gyroscopic effects, and possibly allow the
<br>
wheels to be moved.  Though you might have to put each wheel on its own
<br>
mount, since the wheels might want to twist in opposite directions in
<br>
reaction to their mount moving.
<br>
<p>Then again, with this mount, you might not need the counterrotating
<br>
wheel at all.  The outermost mount doesn't turn relative to whatever
<br>
it's mounted in, and everything inside is free to spin however it
<br>
wants with respect to itself.
