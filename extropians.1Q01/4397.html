<p><em>&gt; Spike: Had an interesting chat with a NASA dude the other night.

<em>&gt; Turns out NASA personnel were in fact openly discussing the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Mars in particular.
</em><br>
<p>Ja, well I would think they need 2 good arms at least, and these can be
<br>
carried with little penalty, unlike legs.
<br>
<p>Consider this: from a weight point of view, a spherical pressure
<br>
vessel is ideal, and we know that using a standard payload fairing
<br>
with something like an Ariane 5 or a Titan 4, we are limited to
<br>
a radius of about 2 meters.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, if our home were to be a 2 meter radius sphere, a
<br>
person of my height, 185 cm, the quarters would effectively
<br>
have only one floor: a flat surface with another flat surface 187
<br>
cm above that, since there is tremendous psychological advantage
<br>
to being able to stand up straight.  {Trust me on this one, for
<br>
I lived in Seattle during the summer of 1983 in a &quot;structure&quot; in
<br>
which I could not stand up straight.  Long story.}  A 185
<br>
cm person, who might actually stretch a couple cm in the
<br>
0.38G, would find it close quarters indeed.
<br>
<p>Now consider the previously mentioned Verne Troyer,
<br>
height, 80 cm.  In that case, the 2 meter radius pressure
<br>
vessel in which he must live is now certainly still cramped,
<br>
but no so much as my Seattle digs.  It could be divided
<br>
into three operable levels, 82 cm apart, with storage in
<br>
the extreme bottom and top.  In this case, we might even
<br>
be able to send two persons, which would have enormous
<br>
psychological advantages, eh?  A small person who didnt
<br>
have legs would be even more able to live inside a
<br>
2 meter sphere.  Notice Im not suggesting *amputating*
<br>
operable legs, but rather choosing a volunteer who
<br>
already lacks these lower appendages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I told him someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (you) had suggested bringing new humans in test tubes.
</em><br>
<p>Or a thermos bottle, yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But of course that's not exactly feasible just now either.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly why not?  If we had a female version of Troyer,
<br>
could she not thaw and implant a frozen embryo, if
<br>
the subsurface farm works out?  Such technology has been with
<br>
us for years actually.  What did you see as the show
<br>
stopper?  spike
