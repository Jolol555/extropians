</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The guaranteed income model I promote in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THE SPIKE ... was developed by an economist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for most of his life in the USA, Robert Theobald.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;the key aspect of Theobald's proposal (and that mad
<br>
<em>&gt; socialist Milton Friedman's) ... is to *abolish* most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bureaucratic meddling and tinkering by making the income floor a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *guaranteed `right'*, a secure floor permitting either enterprise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or sloth.
</em><br>
<p>This might be workable in a situation where basic necessities (however these
<br>
might be defined) were available at such a low cost that to provide them for
<br>
everyone would cause no hardship for anyone (however hardship might be
<br>
defined). Here are the main problems I would predict in administering such a
<br>
program:
<br>
<p>1.If it were limited to a specific geographical region, non-productive
<br>
people from elsewhere would want to get in. In the absence of unlimited
<br>
resources, this would eventually cause the program to fail.
<br>
<p>2. In order for the program to work without using force against some of the
<br>
people expected to fund the program, everyone participating in the program
<br>
would have to have similar definitions of basic necessity and hardship.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;3. If the program is administered over a wide geographical area in order to
<br>
alleviate problem #1 listed above, there is less likely to be agreement on
<br>
the definitions of basic necessity and hardship--thus you'd end up with a
<br>
central authority making rules which would effect people in widely separated
<br>
regions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; True, most models then propose higher taxes once incomes start to exceed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that minimum, but this needn't be any more complex or horrid than the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are done now.
</em><br>
<p>Higher taxes might not even be necessary in the US. You'd only need a shift
<br>
the way currently available money is spent. As I've pointed out before, the
<br>
money spent to perform a &quot;drug&quot; raid on my 2 Vitex shrubs--a totally
<br>
non-productive activity even if one agreed that cannabis should be
<br>
illegal--could have supported three or four people at a basic level for six
<br>
months or maybe even a year.
<br>
<p>In order to make a guaranteed income work, you'd want a very gradual
<br>
progression in tax rates as earned income rises. A common problem in the US
<br>
is that if people go off welfare and go to work, they find themselves worse
<br>
off than before, particularly if they have to pay for child care. Even if
<br>
child care expense is not a problem, expenses for clothing, transportation,
<br>
and food purchase generally go up. Our egregiously regressive social
<br>
security and medicare taxes are deducted even from minimum wage earnings.
<br>
The most common way I've seen people deal with this situation is to get work
<br>
that's paid for in cash and not reported. There's no reason I can think of
<br>
for this sort of relationship between the welfare and taxing structures. And
<br>
yet, there it has been, year after year. One might almost suppose that the
<br>
people making the laws have no contact whatsoever with the real world, or
<br>
that they want the program to fail.
<br>
<p>Note: the earned income credit's actual effect is to offset the social
<br>
security and medicare taxes at low incomes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But where the money going to come from? I'm not going to pay some lazy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thief to loll around, or suffer my rightful earnings to be extorted from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me! --Different points, those. Irrelevant to this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objection. (Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so it seems to me.)
</em><br>
<p>They're different points, yes. But for reasons stated above, I don't agree
<br>
that they're unrelated. Some people's unwillingness to participate in a
<br>
guaranteed income program (presumably, those unwilling to participate would
<br>
be the ones expected to fund the program) will make behavioral control (and
<br>
thus bureaucratic meddling) necessary. I do agree that a program could be
<br>
structured in such a way as to minimize such meddling, but unless one
<br>
expects to get along by blind luck, one must first recognize the problem
<br>
before one can take appropriate steps to solve it.
<br>
