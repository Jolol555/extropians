<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Each week, &quot;Life Extension Update
<br>
Exclusive&quot; features an article not found on Life Extension's website or in
<br>
Life Extension Magazine.
<br>
<p>Vaccine halts Alzheimer's disease in mice
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's disease effects almost one out of every ten people over age
<br>
sixty-five, and people over eighty have four times this risk.  The disease
<br>
is characterized by severe memory loss and the formation in the brain of
<br>
what are known as senile plaques, containing the protein beta-amyloid.
<br>
Mutations to the gene that codes for this protein have been found to cause
<br>
an overproduction of  beta-amyloid peptide in the brain and resultant
<br>
plaque formation.  It had not been known whether these plaques are
<br>
causative of dementia, but a recent study published in The Journal of
<br>
Neuroscience indicates they are.  (See &quot;What's Hot&quot; below.)  In research
<br>
published in the journal Nature last year, mice genetically modified to
<br>
overproduce beta-amyloid who show the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease were
<br>
vaccinated with beta-amyloid peptide.  The mice developed antibodies to
<br>
the protein which caused the disappearance of senile plaques in the brain.
<br>
Now researchers have found that the vaccine appears to arrest memory loss
<br>
as well in this animal model.  The December 21 2000 issue of Nature
<br>
published two papers that confirm that Alzheimer's model mice who were
<br>
immunized with beta-amyloid demonstrated a reduction in memory and
<br>
learning deficit when performing certain tests over a period of time,
<br>
compared to nonimmunized controls.  The immunized mice experienced the
<br>
expected reduction in beta-amyloid as well.
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's authority Paul Chapman of Cardiff University stated, &quot;This is
<br>
big news. If the results had gone the other way then a lot of people would
<br>
have been forced to rethink . . .  The really significant aspect of this
<br>
work to me is not so much the result but the process they use. Other
<br>
treatment studies tend to create the pathology of Alzheimer's and then try
<br>
to make them go away. Tests of behaviour like this are critical.&quot;
<br>
<p>Researcher Dave Morgan of the University of South Florida in Tampa who
<br>
coauthored one of the Nature papers feels that this evidence supports the
<br>
hypothesis that beta-amyloid-containing deposits are related to the
<br>
dementia experienced by these patients..  Large scale clinical trials are
<br>
planned in hopes that treatments based on the vaccine will prevent or
<br>
postpone the development on Alzheimer's symptoms in humans.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Alzheimer's plaques probable cause, not effect
<br>
<p>The Journal of Neuroscience (volume 21, 2001) published a report of
<br>
research conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health
<br>
Sciences (NIEHS) that the plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's
<br>
patients disrupt brain signals which may contribute to the memory loss
<br>
experienced by this group. These plaques contain a protein called
<br>
beta-amyloid and their presence is confirmative of an Alzheimer's
<br>
diagnosis upon autopsy of the brain. The beta-amyloid peptide has been
<br>
found in the brains of both humans and animals. Although it had been
<br>
frequently speculated, it had not been known whether these plaques were
<br>
causative of the disease's symptoms.
<br>
<p>Working with rats, the NIEHS team of Jerrel L. Yakel, PhD, Diana L.
<br>
Pettitt, Ph.D., and Zuoyi Shao, Ph.D, working from NIEHS' headquarters and
<br>
laboratory in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, discovered that
<br>
beta-amyloid binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a key
<br>
signalling receptor in the brain's hippocampus, which is the area of the
<br>
brain involved in emotion, memory and motivation. This blocks the
<br>
transmission of signals involved in learning and memory. According to the
<br>
researchers this is the first time that a link between Alzheimer's plaques
<br>
and failed brain function has been established.
<br>
<p>Although several treatments are available which can temporarily relieve
<br>
some of the symptoms Alzheimer's disease, there is no cure, and with a
<br>
longer-lived population the disease's incidence in the U.S. is on the
<br>
rise. Dr Yakel stated, &quot;Knowing how the disease process works makes it
<br>
more likely that medical science can find ways to slow, halt or even
<br>
reverse the process.&quot; He predicted that improved therapies could result
<br>
from finding chemicals that prevent the binding of beta-amyloid to the
<br>
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Alzheimer's disease
<br>
<p>The only two FDA-approved drugs for treatment of Alzheimer's disease are
<br>
both acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: tacrine (Cognex) and donepezil
<br>
(Aricept). Huperzine-A, metrifonate, and rivastigmine are also
<br>
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors-and the last two may receive FDA approval
<br>
soon. Huperzine-A has been used for centuries in China as an herbal
<br>
medicine prepared from the moss Huperzia serrata. Side effects from
<br>
tacrine, including liver toxicity, make donepezil (Aricept) the first drug
<br>
of choice.
<br>
<p>Although acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can apparently reverse symptoms
<br>
by several months, they have not been shown to slow the progress of neuron
<br>
degeneration. By contrast, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
<br>
trial with daily doses of 10 mg deprenyl (selegiline), 2000 IU vitamin E,
<br>
or both showed a 25% slowing of the progress of the disease, but without
<br>
any cognitive improvement. There was no advantage to using both deprenyl
<br>
and vitamin E, so vitamin E alone would be a less expensive and more
<br>
convenient therapy for most patients.
<br>
<p>Treatment of cultured neurons with vitamin E has been shown to protect
<br>
them from beta-amyloid toxicity. This suggests that vitamin E and other
<br>
antioxidants such as vitamin C (which regenerates vitamin E) and coenzyme
<br>
Q10 may be of value in preventing Alzheimer's disease. In fact, melatonin
<br>
has been shown to protect cell cultures from beta-amyloid toxicity.
<br>
N-acetylcysteine has protected cultured cells from oxidative stress due to
<br>
AGE-modified tau-protein. (Advanced glycation end-products, AGEs, lead to
<br>
the formation of toxic hydroxyl free radicals and impaired ion and glucose
<br>
transport, which cause neuron degeneration. This is discussed in detail
<br>
further in the text.)

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
Melatonin 3 mg capsules
<br>
<p>Melatonin is the most effective antioxidant yet studied because it easily
<br>
penetrates cell membranes (especially in the brain) to provide protection
<br>
against free radicals throughout all our cells. Melatonin crosses the
<br>
blood-brain barrier very effectively. It appears to protect the central
<br>
nervous system against injury, disease, and aging better than any other
<br>
substance.
<br>
<p>The Life Extension Foundation believes that melatonin is the single most
<br>
effective antiaging therapy in the world. It has been shown, in thousands
<br>
of published studies, to protect against almost every disease associated
<br>
with aging including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, age-associated
<br>
immune impairment, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as
<br>
against aging itself. The Life Extension Foundation uses only
<br>
pharmaceutical-quality melatonin that has been assayed for purity.
