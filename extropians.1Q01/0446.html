&quot;The idea of someone being smart enough to build a
<br>
universal assembler and concurrently being dumb enough
<br>
to not build it with sufficient controls is
<br>
nonsensical...&quot;
<br>
<p>**Oh? And who sayd intelligence is related to caution,
<br>
meticulousness, or indeed sanity? Teams of highly
<br>
intelligent people design software; does that mean it
<br>
is bug-free? The same is true of nuke plant
<br>
construction and safety systems--does that mean
<br>
they're flawless?
<br>
<p>**Hitler was quite intelligent. Was he sane? Perhaps.
<br>
Was he evil? Undoubtedly. So--suppose the first one
<br>
smart enough to build the damned things is evil?
<br>
Suppose further that he or she is insane--and desires
<br>
nothing more than to destroy the world and everything
<br>
on it?
<br>
<p>**Ah--what then, hmm..?
<br>
<p>**As Joy has said--a terrifying empowerment of extreme
<br>
individuals...

that control has failed.
<br>

nanotech or biotech

</em><br>
<p>I fail to see such killing power. Much ado about
<br>
nothing. Biotech
<br>
warfare has been with us for centuries to no ill
<br>
effect. The idea of
<br>
someone being smart enough to build a universal
<br>
assembler and
<br>
concurrently being dumb enough to not build it with
<br>
sufficient controls
<br>
is nonsensical. Purely Pollyanish Paranoia Posing
<br>
preposterously as
<br>
proper public politics.
