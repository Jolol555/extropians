<p>Stem cell discovery reverses time
<br>
<p>BY NIGEL HAWKES, HEALTH EDITOR
<br>
<p>A researcher based in Britain claims to have achieved the biological
<br>
equivalent of reversing time. She says that she has perfected a method of
<br>
creating stem cells from adult cells, bypassing the ethical dilemma of
<br>
&quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; which recently divided the House of Commons.
<br>
Although Parliament voted in favour of research into therapeutic cloning,
<br>
many people remain uneasy about creating embryos solely for use as a source
<br>
of spare parts.
<br>
<p>If Ilham Abuljadayel's claims are verified, treatments for a wide variety of
<br>
diseases such as leukaemia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease may
<br>
be transformed. Not only does her method produce a supply of healthy cells
<br>
from the patient's own blood, but it generates far more cells, more quickly,
<br>
than alternative methods, and without raising ethical dilemmas.
<br>
<p>So unlikely does the claim seem to many biologists that she has found it
<br>
impossible to have it published in leading journals. But now, she says, it
<br>
has been replicated by one of the world's leading contract research
<br>
companies, Covance, and a company has been set up to market the idea.
<br>
<p>Stem cells are the forerunners of the mature cells that make up the organs
<br>
of the body. They are &quot;pluripotent&quot;, that is, they have within them the
<br>
capacity to develop into many different types of cell - brain, muscle or
<br>
blood, for example. The simplest source of a stem cell is a developing
<br>
embryo, but until now it has been thought impossible to re-programme a fully
<br>
developed adult cell and create a stem cell. That is what Dr Abuljadayel
<br>
says that she can do.
<br>
<p>Born in Saudi Arabia and educated at King's College London, she went back to
<br>
her native country to work as an immunologist. She made her discovery by
<br>
accident. She was trying to kill white blood cells by using a particular
<br>
antibody when she forgot to add one ingredient to the mixture.
<br>
<p>The result was not dead cells, but cells that had been transformed into stem
<br>
cells. She calls the process retrodifferentiation: a reversal of the normal
<br>
process by which immature stem cells differentiate to become mature adult
<br>
cells.
<br>
<p>Since the discovery she has worked to convince others that it is real. She
<br>
has used a laboratory in the department of physiology in Cambridge and
<br>
presented a seminar there before Christmas.
<br>
<p>One leading scientist familiar with her work, Professor Adrian Newland of
<br>
the Royal London Hospital Medical School, said that he had repeated her
<br>
experiments with the same results.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's fascinating, but there could be other explanations for what is going
<br>
on,&quot; he said. &quot;My own work suggests that it isn't possible to reverse the
<br>
process of differentiation, but I have repeated her work and got similar
<br>
results. I think more research needs to be done to eliminate other possible
<br>
explanations. As it stands, it could be amazing, or it could be
<br>
inconsequential.&quot;
<br>
<p>The first clinical application of the technique could be in treating
<br>
leukaemia.
<br>
<p>Dr Abuljadayel says that blood would be taken from the patient and treated
<br>
to create a population of new stem cells, a process that takes only a few
<br>
hours.
<br>
<p>The patient would then be treated with drugs or radiation to destroy the
<br>
bone marrow cells and kill the cancer, before repopulating the bone marrow
<br>
with cells generated from the stem cells.
<br>
<p>Dr Abuljadayel's husband, Ghazi Dhout, who is president of Tristem, the
<br>
Dublin-based company set up to exploit the discovery, says that a big
<br>
advantage is that a huge volume of cells can be generated.
<br>
<p>He says that the first trials, on individual patients, might start in the
<br>
next six months.The company plans to seek partners among the big drug and
<br>
biotech companies to develop the business. The invention is patented.
<br>
<p>A cure for leukaemia may be possible with the discovery of an immune cell
<br>
that can seek and destroy infected cells. The development was announced by
<br>
researchers at London's Hammersmith Hospital and the Imperial College of
<br>
Medicine, who have spent six years investigating the disease.
