<p><em>    &gt; **At a guess, I'd say Yes Way.
</em><br>
<p>BUZZ, I'm sorry that's wrong guess.  The answer is that the feeble emanations from a
<br>
unexploded H Bomb at sea level could not go through the entire atmosphere and be
<br>
detected by a satellite hundreds of miles away.  As a matter of fact, a satellite couldn't
<br>
even detect ionizing radiation from an EXPLODING H bomb at sea level.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Medical isotopes do not travel outward from former Soviet states,
</em><br>
<p>Why not? There are more medical isotopes in the former USSR that any other place on
<br>
earth. And if you don't like that example, how about a few  hundred tons of high phosphate
<br>
fertilizer (I did not say shit), that's about as radioactive as a small H bomb.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; follow obscure backroads, or reside for  extended periods in areas lacking sophisticated
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; medical equipment.
</em><br>
<p>Then go over major highways and stay in sophisticated areas.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The emissions signature is also  quite different.
</em><br>
<p>Quite different? How exactly? The only thing you'd have a chance of detecting is the U238,
<br>
everything else is shielded by the guts of the bomb, and U238 is just another isotope, another
<br>
slightly radioactive isotope. Ok, maybe ratio of neutrons to gamma ray photons in a warhead
<br>
might be very slightly higher than most (not all) isotopes,  but neutrons get absorbed before they
<br>
go very far and being uncharged are very difficult to measure. Forget satellites or even low flying
<br>
airplanes, think of a steamer trunk full of instruments 5 feet from a suspected H bomb for a hour,
<br>
then maybe.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Do you really think the gov't is going to  call a press conference and say,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&quot;Well, gee, you know,  this bunch of loonies almost blew up New York--but we
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;got there in the nick of time..?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Do you really think that government in the age of the internet could keep the story of the century
<br>
under wraps for long?
