Here we go again!  Darn, darn, darn.  If I didn't have spike around to help
<br>
me out, I don't know what I'd do.  Thanks, spike.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hmmm, I didnt grok this. Why would not the pressure under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one foot at 70 G be the same as under 70 feet at 1G? Why do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we need the factor of 32? 
</em><br>
<p>When I did my little mental calculation (sloppy thinking, rightly
<br>
characterized) and came up with 70 g's, I didn't think it was right.  But I
<br>
checked it (sort of) and decided that it was right.  But, as you have
<br>
noted, and proved with your elegant observation by equivalence, that
<br>
&quot;pressure under one foot at 70 G be the same as under 70 feet at 1 G&quot;, I
<br>
was WRONGO.  What happened was that I took the pressure at 2300 feet of
<br>
seawater and converted it at one atm per 33 feet to 70 atm, and then
<br>
carelessly used that number as the equivalent G force.  That would have
<br>
been correct only if our mars bound astronaut had been submerged in a
<br>
column of seawater 33 feet deep, not one foot deep.  The bad news is I have
<br>
to eat crow, and do my little &quot;Confession of wrongness&quot; dance (Oh, the
<br>
ignominy!), the good news is that our astronaut gets to increase his
<br>
maximum tolerable rate of acceleration by a factor of 33, bringing it up to
<br>
2310 G.  Yes!  This is what I intuited originally, before buying into my
<br>
blunder.  So the trip to mars is going to be quite a bit faster.  Just how
<br>
much faster you'll see in a moment.
<br>
<p>ZM Spike also asks, 
<br>
<em>&gt;Why do we need the factor of 32? 
</em><br>
<p>In d=1/2 at^2 [Actually, to avoid confusion this should be written d= (1/2)
<br>
at^2 ], a  is g=32 ft/sec^2.
<br>
<p>Also, ZMS notes:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I learned in school that the Earth is 98,000,000 miles from he sun, so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Minor nit: average distance from Earth to the sun is about 93 million miles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the sun. 
</em><br>
<p>Right you are, and me, well, WRONG AGAIN. Getting to be like a broken
<br>
record.  Now I see what the Mars Orbiter people were up against, kinda.
<br>
<p>So , going back into the transit time calculation with 2310 G, and
<br>
93,000,000 miles, we get
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
t=time to the halfway point=
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=SQRT((2 x 24,366,000 mi x 5280 ft/mi)/(2310 x 32 ft/s^2))
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=1866 sec
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=31 min 6 sec
<br>
<p>Total trip time then would be: 1 hr 2 min 12 sec.
<br>
<p>&quot;Due to its brevity there will be no meal service during this flight.
<br>
Please remain in your pressure vessel until we have docked at the airlock.&quot;
<br>
<p>And, for those who might be interested in the maximum velocity achieved,
<br>
<p>v(max) = acceleration times time to midpoint
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=(2310 x 32 ft/sec^2) x (1866 sec)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=137,934,720 ft/sec
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=26,124 mi/sec
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 0.14 c
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's easier with a zen master backing you up.&quot;
