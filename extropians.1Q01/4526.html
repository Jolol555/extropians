</em><br>
<p>An admission that a measurement has an error, and the realization that
<br>
a measurement without an error bar wouldn't survive even a trace of 
<br>
peer scrutiny. That apart from the obvious cases of &quot;candidate A won&quot; 
<br>
or &quot;candidate B won&quot; or &quot;candidate C won&quot; there's also &quot;within the
<br>
error margins, we can't tell, so it's a tie&quot;, and a procedere for 
<br>
resolving such. As flipping an unbiased coin, or a public duel, 
<br>
or whatever.
<br>
<p>Apart from that, anything with a &quot;democracy&quot; somewhere in it is supposed
<br>
to represent the meaning of majority of voters. Not representatives of
<br>
such, or some d'Hondtian games with numbers. Not to open the can of
<br>
worms of basis democracy vs. elitism...
