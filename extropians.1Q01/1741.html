<em>&gt; I have to say I don't really understand this paranoia of yours.
</em><br>
<p>Its not paranoia when it actually happens to many people, and not just
<br>
in countries with funny names (they tend to be more like your country).
<br>
Whether its the BATF raiding a remote cabin or church, or DEA agents and
<br>
local police raiding an alleged 'kingpin', the Secret Service raiding a
<br>
software company with a blank search warrant, there have been at the
<br>
very least several dozen such cases in the last decade, resulting in
<br>
hundreds of deaths, with not one policeman being held responsible for
<br>
the innocent people they killed, and rarely is a government held even
<br>
financially responsible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In normal countries like where I live ;-), nobody has a gun. Only licensed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunters, police officers and army officers are allowed to have weapons. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I understand this was also the case in 1938 in some countries. Lets
<br>
see, you are in Slovenia, according to whois.net, which is a former
<br>
Yugoslav republic. Hmmmm, no, I'm sure every person killed in your
<br>
country definitely needed to be killed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else wants to have a weapon, it's a tough procedure to get it - among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things, you have to get a license and register with the government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you can be quite sure you won't get a license if you have any kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminal record. Without a license, no purchase possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, there are gangs and lunatics, and they have illegal guns. But they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't shoot people all over the place - in fact, gangs very rarely shoot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone outside of their circles at all [for kidnapping victims, they seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer drowning], while lunatics typically shoot people they are angry with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they get caught easily, and then they get something like a 10 year prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence.
</em><br>
<p>Or they get into government and start genocides and civil wars or
<br>
continent wide wars. No european nation has any right to claim they are
<br>
in any way more peaceful or safer. The odds of a european dying from gun
<br>
fire is about a hundred times higher than for any American.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, the police can &quot;raid your house with a swat team, shoot first and ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions later&quot;. But it doesn't happen; we simply don't have a national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture of shooting each other. The police very rarely use their weapons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even in extreme cases, and each bullet is accounted for. And that's even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with our police being somewhat corrupt - there are reports that some of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take bribes to allow some people to do things they shouldn't, but I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard of a police officer to shoot a person that is anything less than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant, widely known and notorious criminal.
</em><br>
<p>This is funny, coming from former territory of Yugoslavia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, I don't think America's aversion against banning guns has any rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure at all. There is no need to buy them back. There is no need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy on guns. You just ban them, instate a heavy fine on owning illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons, and that's it. Give everyone a year or two to get used to the fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the problem is solved.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the Riechsgeletsblatt did that quite well in the 30's. Its also
<br>
been tried in Britain and Australia in the 90's to disastrous effect,
<br>
crime has been rising by double digits in every year since their bans
<br>
took effect. Property crime in Britain is five times higher than it is
<br>
in the US, violent crime is two times higher in Britain than in the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In particular, your argument about someone protecting themselves with a gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the police &quot;raid his house with a swat team&quot; is, well, far off. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think your swat teams are expert enough that no one will survive shooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back against them. If they want to shoot you, they can do it anyway -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretending a gun provides any real protection against the police is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion. The only thing you might be able to do with it is kill a few good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police officers before they put a bullet in your head for doing so.
</em><br>
<p>By definition, if a police officer is conducting an illegal raid on the
<br>
home of an innocent law abiding citizen, they are NOT a 'good police
<br>
officer', and under the law a private citizen has the right to defend
<br>
themselves against criminals in their homes, which is what a cop
<br>
committing an illegal act is...
