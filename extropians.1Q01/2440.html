<p>As we used to say on this list, &quot;extraordinary claims require 
<br>
extraordinary evidence.&quot;  Do you have any evidence that global 
<br>
warming is really a giant hoax by scientists to get grant money? 
<br>
What you said above is just speculation and could be said by any 
<br>
conspiracy theorist about any conspiracy theory.  I keep hearing 
<br>
these claims from Rush Limbaugh and the like, but I never see any 
<br>
hard scientific data on any of the science groups.  Where does one go 
<br>
to find real data and not just political positioning?
<br>
<p>The article you originally quoted in this thread, for example, had 
<br>
nothing to do with global warming.  It studied temperatures millions 
<br>
of years ago.  You presented it as evidence against global warming, 
<br>
even though the authors indicated their support for the claims of 
<br>
global warming.  This was not evidence against global warming, even 
<br>
though you presented it as such.  I have followed many such examples 
<br>
of &quot;evidence&quot;, only to find that the original article did not say was 
<br>
the proponents thought it did.
<br>
<p>We have ice-core studies and tree ring studies that claim to show 
<br>
that average temperature has suddenly risen in the last 100 years 
<br>
when compared to the previous 100,000 years.  Where do I find studies 
<br>
that claim evidence that the ice-core and tree ring studies are 
<br>
wrong, or give different evidence that temperatures have not risen? 
<br>
I have not been able to find the actual scientific studies to 
<br>
determine the issue for myself.
