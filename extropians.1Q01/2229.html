<p>He has no programming skills worth mentioning. He's a suit who has been at
<br>
the right place at the right time. I'll grant you he's a good businessman,
<br>
and he had a good hand when hiring initial set of people.
<br>
<p>I do not care about Gates in particular, but the Redmond phenomenon is Evil 
<br>
with a capital E. It has nuked lots of promising IT branches, substituting 
<br>
them with zombieware. Not to mention hiring top talent, and sending them down 
<br>
to the pit, after subjecting them to a frontal lobotomy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and resources(peons) of course). as something of a pragmaticist, i must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out that this is a man who is DOING things, and on a scale unheard of
</em><br>
<p>I know that large sections of IT industry are existing as Redmond scavengers.
<br>
They're making a living fixing stuff which had no business being broken in
<br>
the first place. If you think that's admirable, I think you're rather
<br>
warped.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; for any other entity. the man has donated more money than has EVER been
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; can appreciate that.
</em><br>
<p>He throws his money around indiscriminately, or, worse, by supporting causes
<br>
which help MS.
<br>
<p>Apart from that, the amount of damage the man and company have inflicted upon
<br>
the world is unfixable in any amount of $$$s. IBM/Intel/Microsoft working 
<br>
together have created a reality which is rather far from being optimal. If you 
<br>
judge them, you're comparing merely stuff which currently exists, and not seeing 
<br>
the alternative branches which would now exist if not for a number of specific 
<br>
decisions, which can be traced back to the year 1978.
<br>
<p>It should be given some thought, why so many computer people have such a strong
<br>
reaction towards Redmond. Hint: sour grapes it ain't.
