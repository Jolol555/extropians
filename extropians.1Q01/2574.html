<p>That's true. Otherwise it's nothing more than hypocrisy. This is the 
<br>
problem I was having in discussing child rearing with Chris Russo. Our 
<br>
ideas seemed to be so far apart that I couldn't find any common ground.
<br>
<p>And yet there actually were some areas of common ground with me and Chris: 
<br>
we both love our kids and want the best for them; we both believe in 
<br>
letting the kids do things for themselves to  the limits of what they're 
<br>
able to handle; we both believe that immunization is good; we both believe 
<br>
in early breast feeding; we both believe it's more pleasant to be around 
<br>
polite, well behaved children than kids who run around yelling and breaking 
<br>
things. I could probably find more common ground if I went back through the 
<br>
posts and searched, but I don't know if it would have helped in this case. 
<br>
Child rearing is such an emotional subject among people who have children, 
<br>
and my ideas are somewhat radical in the context of our culture.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a challenge I wish I'd tried harder to meet. Even in retrospect, 
<br>
though, I can't think of a more tactful but still honest way I could have 
<br>
responded.  Maybe by focusing on the libertarian ideal that one human 
<br>
should not initiate force against another? That may have been another bit 
<br>
of common ground.
