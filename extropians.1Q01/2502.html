<p>Taxation is a way entities can pay for public goods (or be forced to
<br>
pay for what some entity considers good, at least). There may very
<br>
well be alternatives that better will suit the economy of
<br>
hyperintelligences.

</em><br>
<p>The important thing is that postbiological beings will likely be
<br>
involved not just in economic relationships but also form various
<br>
societies. This will make the development of institutions like
<br>
taxation to solve certain problems likely, even if the institutions
<br>
and problems are very different from current human one. Economics
<br>
isn't just about monetary relationships, but also about general
<br>
interactions involving utility (didn't Ludwig von Mieses suggest a
<br>
fancy Greek word meaning &quot;getting enemies to work together&quot; or
<br>
somthing similar rather than the zerosumish 'economics' as the name
<br>
for the field? A friend mentioned it today, but the exact term slipped
<br>
my mind).
<br>
<p>When discussing AIs/SIs the economic ideas employed are often very
<br>
primitive. Often the issue is simply ignored or a kind of zero level
<br>
economy of getting what is needed through superior force or just
<br>
picking it up is assumed. This is generally linked with the idea of a
<br>
spiking SI, so that there is really a single agent with near total
<br>
autonomy. A more nuanced look at AI/SI economics would take into
<br>
account what has been learned in game theory and economics, the
<br>
economic context these entities come into existence inside and then
<br>
co-evolve with, the higher-order interactions that would emerge
<br>
between different kinds of agents and so on.
<br>
<p>I have had a paper on the game theory and economics of human-posthuman
<br>
interactions sitting in one of my virtual desk drawers for several
<br>
years now. The reason that it is going slowly is that the more I think
<br>
about the issues and learn about economics the more inadequate I
<br>
consider my deductions - it is a paper that I am actually making
<br>
negative progress on! :-) At the same time the issue is important, and
<br>
I think that it *can* be tackled. Posthumans might not calculate taxes
<br>
like we do, but they will be economic entities. As Minsky pointed out
<br>
about aliens, math and economics might be the only thing we have in
<br>
common with them.
