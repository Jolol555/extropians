</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You evade the key point. A million genome copies of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Let's go back. In the Beginning (so to speak)--there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were ZERO genome copies of X. THere was, in fact, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **So--how do we get from there, to a million genome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies of X? 'Tis the more fundamental question. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've said, natural selection in obviously in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation; I do not refute/deny/quibble with this. No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question. My problem with it is this: It needs more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not enough. It is insufficient to get from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beginning to where we are now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The question of how we got to maybe half a dozen genome copies from zero is
<br>
an interesting one, and one which I think not many claim to have a
<br>
satisfactory or complete answer to. However, from there, natural selection
<br>
can move to millions and billions and zillions (being 10^lots).
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  By random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance, many are slightly and heritably altered. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; performance of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; great majority of offspring in a given setting is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; degraded, of a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; improved. How hard is it to see that gradually the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offspring of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [contingently-]improved variants will supplant the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others? Chance, yes -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; followed by competitive-plus-cooperative selection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Now--who/what laid down the rules? Why should this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be? How did it begin?
</em><br>
<p>You must not confuse the beginning with the process. The initial state is
<br>
mostly unrelated to following states after a certain amount of steps in an
<br>
interative process like this. The question of how it came to be is
<br>
interesting; the beginning of things, if there can be said to be one, is
<br>
shrouded in mystery (hopefully some of our astronomical friends can expound
<br>
apon this a little, it's pretty fun).
<br>
<p>But the operation of the process of natural selection is so basic, it is
<br>
hard to question it once you *get* it. A generation of self-replicators is
<br>
formed. There is an environment which is not abundant enough that all can
<br>
survive and replicate, or at least so that all can replicate equally. So,
<br>
genes are passed on more plentifully than others; these are those of the
<br>
most successful phentotypes, the organisms themselves. The next generation
<br>
of genes reflects the more successful organisms better than the less
<br>
successful ones.
<br>
<p>It's a really dumb process; inherently lacking in intelligence. It's one of
<br>
the great wonders of the universe that we would develop from that; however,
<br>
it is not at all implausible.
<br>
<p>A really very interesting thing to note about natural selection is that it
<br>
works better than you would imagine. I learned this after working on some
<br>
material from a book called &quot;genetic programming&quot; (can't remember the author
<br>
or anything else, it was borrowed from the library). It turns out that, in
<br>
software mimicking the process of natural selection, you can evolve highly
<br>
ordered solutions or systems (even software) from a surprisingly small
<br>
number of generations. What you can do in an afternoon on a single-processor
<br>
pentium is quite astounding, and un-intuitive. Perhaps the world could be
<br>
created in 7 days after all; it'd probably require a P4 though.
<br>
<p>If I remember correctly, you can, for instance, evolve the logic table for
<br>
an &quot;xor&quot; operation in less than 5 generations. A trivial example, but it
<br>
amazed me that you could evolve anything in less than hundreds of
<br>
generations.
<br>
<p>Now DNA's replication scheme is a bit more complicated than that used in
<br>
computer experiments; that makes it no less powerful (possibly it makes it
<br>
more powerful). Given the span of time life has been on this planet, and the
<br>
number of generations, it's not so surprising that there is such diversity
<br>
and complexity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You, I gather, see a Mind from outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the system intervening top-down to produce an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; echo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Its own order.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;**Entropy is said to be the natural condition. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;suggest that Extropy requires intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; `Extropy' is not a scientific concept or construct;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; metaphor. Complex energetic organisation emerges and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thrives by exporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entropy into its environment; intelligence has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing to do with this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **But it results in manifest intelligence, yes? Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this result not be said to be the &quot;goal&quot; of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of organization?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If something results from a system, that does not mean that the result was
<br>
the system's goal; you can't even ascribe motive to a system. Motive is
<br>
something for intelligent entities. The system of Natural selection is so
<br>
dumb (and amazing), you can jot the key points down on a matchbook cover.
<br>
There is no goal, just emergent phenomena, side effects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I said nothing about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;top-down intervention by an intelligence residing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;outside the system. The intelligence may BE the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, I see. The universe brought *itself*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligently into being. Too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cool. Too self-undermining.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **&quot;Too cool?&quot; Isn't it, though?
</em><br>
<p>Well, it might be cool, but it is content free.
<br>
<p>What do you mean by &quot;The intelligence may BE the system&quot;? How? Do you mean
<br>
that the physical laws of the universe somehow embody an intelligence, that
<br>
there is some extra thing which guides their (assumedly capricious)
<br>
application? That's the same as assuming God, as far as I can see.
<br>
<p>The start of the system doesn't necessarily have a lot to do with any state
<br>
far beyond it. The origins of the universe do not have any strong
<br>
theoretical impact on the operation of natural selection in biology.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;**Next time you see that Darwin guy, you ask him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;me: How does your theory account for the creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the whole shebang? The starting kickoff?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Your original post made no claims about the origins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the universe, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even the origins of life. You recorded your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentiment that the Hamlet-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human mind was far too angelic to have come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; existence via brute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolutionary processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Discussion broadened, or so I thought. &quot;Angelic?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hardly. (Hey that's religion, ain't it?) There remains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no proof we evolved from primordial pond scum, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in turn evolved from nothing. doesn't that sound a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LITTLE unlikely..?
</em><br>
<p>Well, we came from somewhere. A fairly mainstream view is that it is
<br>
massively unlikely, in fact; however, there's a big universe out there, and
<br>
a long, long time; on that scale, it becomes more probable that somewhere,
<br>
somewhen, this kind of improbable event could occur.
<br>
<p>The really big jump, I think, is from non-replacing chemical soup to
<br>
replicators. I'd like to hear some pontificating on this from someone
<br>
knowledgable, if any of you are reading this. After the replicators exist,
<br>
however, it all becomes a lot more stolid, marching forward from generation
<br>
to generation. Now, from pond scum to us, that's pretty unlikely, but so is
<br>
any state some billions (?) of years after the initial state of any complex
<br>
iterative system. From pond scum to something which in no way resembles it's
<br>
origins, that is incredibly probable. From pond scum to pond scum, that's
<br>
unimaginable.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the probability does not come into play. By the anthropic
<br>
principle, we are going to be us, intelligent life, because what else can we
<br>
be? If we had never existed, that might say something about the probability
<br>
of us existing. Our existence, however, does not say anything other than
<br>
that we are possible. It is not possible to estimate a probability; in turn,
<br>
our origin does not have to be probable. Only possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I reply: actually, the evolution of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain/mind is patently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; darwinian (although some of the selected replicators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were doubtless memes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which by reciprocal feedback co-evolved with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genes providing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; material substrate).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As for the whole shebang, that might be subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; darwinian explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (in the Linde or Smolin models, which are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; untestable), or it might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; due to a stochastic vacuum fluctuation, but either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way it is not relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the emergence by natural selection of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beings 13 or so billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years later. Get a grip on the scale of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; phenomena, sir.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; **It seems I stand accused of being a mystic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few choice bits from AE (the closest thing yet to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no room left by the side of this ordered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regularity for causes of a different nature.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The finest emotion of which we are capable is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is impenatrable for us really exists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligible to our poor faculties - this knowledge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this feeling ... that is the core of the true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marvelous structure of the existing world, together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in nature.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It is in this striving after the rational unification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the manifold that it encounters its greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successes, even though it is precisely this attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which causes it to run the greatest risk of falling a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prey to illusion. But whoever has undergone the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intense experience of successful advances made in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain, is moved by the profound reverence for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality made manifest in existence. By way of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding he achieves a far reaching emancipation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the shackles of personal hopes and desires, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereby attains that humble attitude of mind toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the grandeur of reason, incarnate in existence, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which, in its profoundest depths, is inaccessible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man. This attitude, however, appears to me to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious in the highest sense of the word. And so it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me that science not only purifies the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious imulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also contibutes to a religious spiritualisation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our understanding of life.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.&quot;
