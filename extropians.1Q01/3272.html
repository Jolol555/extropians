<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;         Which PDA is this?  I need to get off of the braindead Palm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Preferably in the direction of a wearable. But a Linux PDA would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; good start.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is my Yopy PDA, from Samsung Electronics.  It has a 200 Mhz ARM processor, 32 MB of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; storage and 16MB of memory.  It's color, with a touch screen and stylus, and game buttons. It's the same size as a Palm, maybe thicker.  It came through Customs last week.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm wondering if anyone has tried using QNX for a PDA OS. THe OS with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; browser and other utilities all fits on a 1.44 floppy and boots on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PCs and linux boxes just dandy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See www.qnx.com for info if you haven't seen this before.
</em><br>
<p>I have seen some of that.  I remember from the QNX ads that it is a real-time operating system.  It is a small kernel, with a message passing infrastructure.  The literature
<br>
they sent showed it used in a blood filtering device.
<br>
<p>I think the operating systems, the simple ones, they are not so hard to make, but they take skill to make.
<br>
<p>The processor is actually 206 MHz.  I would put more ports on it, but, I am not so good at soldering.
