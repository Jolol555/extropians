<p>
For reason's sake, please stop jumping on one another and calling each 
<br>
other liars. I skimmed the relevant posts and don't think anyone was being 
<br>
dishonest or lying. Loree -- you called Brian Williams dishonest. I think 
<br>
that was unfair. I read the post in question and I didn't notice any 
<br>
reference to guns. I suspect the same was true of Brian's reading. It was 
<br>
only when Harvey re-posted the relevant passage that I noticed the oblique 
<br>
reference that didn't use the term &quot;gun&quot;. I think this was simply a 
<br>
misreading and misunderstanding. Accusing Brian of lying (when I've never 
<br>
seen any reason to question his ethics) is unnecessarily inflammatory.
<br>
<p>And calling Harvey a liar is completely unacceptable as far as I'm 
<br>
concerned. Harvey has consistently shown even-handedness in many good 
<br>
attempts to set things straight. I took it not that he was saying that the 
<br>
word &quot;guns&quot; had been used, but that something close to that was introduced 
<br>
unnecessarily.
<br>
<p>Everyone should just relax. We're not rotten evil people on this list. Give 
<br>
the other person the benefit of the doubt. Look for an interpretation of 
<br>
someone's words that doesn't require judging them to be a liar. Perhaps 
<br>
they missed something in their reading. Perhaps they interpreted something 
<br>
differently. Assume someone is innocent (or at worst careless, not 
<br>
dishonest) until proven otherwise.
<br>
<p>We have had a few clearly nasty, lying, destructive people on this list, 
<br>
but the regulars are not among them. Stop baiting each other, stop looking 
<br>
for anything to attack. Look for common ground. Look for productive 
<br>
disagreements.
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
