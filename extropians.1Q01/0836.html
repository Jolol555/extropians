<p><em>&gt; I'm reading it now. The science is good, obviously,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yah, right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHAT defenses? The basic problem, of course, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you really need a nanodefense--and that you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly develop one until (as Drexler has pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out) the tech is already here.
</em><br>
<p>The difference being that there is a wide variety of possible molecular
<br>
nanosystems, of which self-replicating goo is only a small subset, and
<br>
likely the most difficult to design.  It is possible (but by no means
<br>
certain) to have non-self-replicating nanodefenses in place well before
<br>
anyone is capable of building a nanoreplicator.  Read towards the end of
<br>
Rob's paper, where he makes a strong but admittedly not entirely
<br>
convincing argument that prepositioned defenses can trump replicators.
<br>
<p>The rub in this argument is the time lag between the first nanosystems and
<br>
the first wild nanoreplicators.  If we have to rely on more or less
<br>
conventional design (CAD systems, shape description languages,
<br>
standardized part systems, design compilers, etc) the the time lag could
<br>
be many years.  If, on the other hand, MNT results rapidly in strong
<br>
super-human AI, then the lag could be only hours. AI is the important
<br>
factor (IMHO), not nanotech itself.
<br>
<p>It is also not quite true to say that nano is the *only* defense against
<br>
nano.  Rob and I discussed it, and came to the conclusion that, for
<br>
localized infestations, napalm would work just dandy.  Inelegant, though,
<br>
and rather tough on the neighbors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, as I say, I'm still looking it over. Homework is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I'm doing; that's why I'm here.
</em><br>
<p>Good for you!  May I also suggest Chapters 13 and 14 of Drexler's
<br>
&quot;Nanosystems&quot;.  They concern overall architecture, and are a little less
<br>
technical than the previous chapters.  This may give a little
<br>
perspective beyond the &quot;self replicating little critters&quot; paradigm.  
<br>
Hint: neither the word &quot;replicating&quot; or &quot;self-replicating&quot; appear in
<br>
Nanosystem's index.  Pages 66 and 67 of &quot;Nanomedicine&quot; also have a good
<br>
discussion of the varieties of replication, and their relative benefits
<br>
and difficulties.
