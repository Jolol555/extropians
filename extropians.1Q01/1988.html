<p>Uh, Max, I did put a smiley after it.  I was speaking more than a bit
<br>
tongue in cheek while still saying some serious things.  I don't have an
<br>
intense hatred for Microsoft.  I have tons of respect for part of what
<br>
MS did like bringing computing to the masses and seeing the desktop
<br>
revolution.   I do think it is utterly despicable that they care more
<br>
for taking over the entire software enterprise than providing top flight
<br>
tools, interoperability and so on. They have hired up some of the best
<br>
software brains on this planet.  And they sit on them and do not use
<br>
what those brains have produced and are capable of producing.  I have no
<br>
respect for their extremely unfriendly treatement of customers and
<br>
developers.  No respect for the pirating of competitors products and
<br>
talent.  No respect for their efforts to undermine major standards which
<br>
are the backbone of the Internet.  And I have very little respect for NT
<br>
or NT5 which to this day cannot (without special case-ing some machines
<br>
and buying yet more product) handle even a simple login gracefully from
<br>
an external user.  What they did with Active Directory and what it does
<br>
to heterogeneous networks that don't want MS to take over all directory
<br>
functions is pretty smelley.  The list could be strung out for a long
<br>
time.  But I don't intensely hate them enough to think Gates is Satan or
<br>
some such.  I do distrust and despise them enough to not use Windows
<br>
boxen except when I really have to. It is a protest against the BS of
<br>
MS.  They deserve it.
