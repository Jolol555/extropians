<p><em>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, the riddle had its genesis for me when Douglas

</em><br>
<p>He didn't miss it!  It was a meta-gag.  Imagine a cartoon of Hofstadter
<br>
with the bubble above his head which reads:  &quot;Is there such thing as
<br>
a self-answering question?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did you read Godel, Escher, Bach?
</em><br>
<p>YES!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Did you *like* Godel, Escher, Bach?
</em><br>
<p>YES!
<br>
<p>Please indulge me if you have heard my GEB story before.  I like
<br>
to tell it.  This book changed my life, in about the year Eliezer was
<br>
born.  Read it cover to cover twice.  One of my compulsions is to
<br>
mark errors in books.  Almost all books have em.  GEB is error
<br>
free, a remarkable feat for such a long complicated work.
<br>
<p>When the web started catching on around '94 or so, I decided to
<br>
put up a website where people could interpret and answer the question:
<br>
<p>&quot;If one book, which and why?&quot;
<br>
<p>I started coding it up, but before I did, it occurred to me
<br>
that the idea was so obvious, someone else had probably
<br>
already done it, so I better look for it.  I found exactly such
<br>
a site, and several thousand people had posted their book.
<br>
So I posted mine: GEB by Hofstadter, and for the why,
<br>
I said that it was self explanatory.
<br>
<p>Then I noticed that one other person had chosen GEB,
<br>
so I decided to post him an email congratulating him on
<br>
his fine taste in literature.  Turns out it was the guy who
<br>
had put up the website.  {8^D  spike
