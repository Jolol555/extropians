===================================================
<br>
<p>[BOT2001...(31JAN01)
<br>
Nandhra is the President and CEO of FINDbase.com
<br>
He just wants to put the smack-down on bots running amok across the
<br>
Internet, grabbing any data they can find with out the consent of the data
<br>
owners...
<br>
<p>That, in a nutshell, sums up the mission of FINDbase.com, which uses
<br>
analysis products to locate, track, and if need be, stop bot activity
<br>
hitting protected Web sites...
<br>
<p>If INFOtector discovers a bot, it can then implement one of several
<br>
responses, depending on the desires of the site's owners. It can deny
<br>
access, delay access to the point where the bot's user will give up and
<br>
move on, change the data being delivered, or relay the bot's request to a
<br>
welcoming page for the site...
<br>
<p>Even a plain-vanilla search bot can cause hassles for a site, since it
<br>
could deep-link information on your site and bring surfers in through a
<br>
pathway you did not want them to take, perhaps leading it away from your
<br>
ad-revenue-generating pages...
<br>
<p>One of the more creative measures INFOtector users could take when using
<br>
this product is actually feeding price comparison bots false information.
<br>
A customer using a bot may see the commerce site is selling Widget X for
<br>
$80, for example, far below the site's usual $100.
<br>
<p>Is the bot-using customer getting a better deal than the customer who
<br>
surfed in by themselves from the Web? Not necessarily, Nandhra said. Once
<br>
the lower price pulls them in, the price in the shopping cart would
<br>
actually be $100.
<br>
<p>Is this a case of false advertisement? Not at all, Nandhra explained, as
<br>
the owners of the e-commerce site would have already stipulated in their
<br>
copyright that the information they provide to customers is accurate--for
<br>
human users of browsers only. Bots would be excluded from this statement,
<br>
creating a caveat emptor situation for the bot users.
<br>
<p>I raised the concerns some might have with what Nandhra is doing. After
<br>
all, Web sites do put this information up there for all to see, why should
<br>
his company prevent the fair use of a site's content?
<br>
<p>&quot;I suppose the knee-jerk reaction would be this,&quot; Nandhra said, &quot;say you
<br>
have the ability to reach into somebody's wallet and pull money out. Is it
<br>
right?&quot;
<br>
<p>Upon additional reflection, Nandhra continued, &quot;Sites are there to make
<br>
money. The Internet is freely accessible. Content should not be free.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nandhra also said that INFOtector will now give people the ability to
<br>
track the distribution of any content from a client Web site and now give
<br>
Web site owners the ability to actually enforce copyright law on the
<br>
Internet, a process that until now has been very difficult.]
