</em><br>
<em>&gt; to know about it in advance than to be taken by surprise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with this a general prescription.  Sometimes the trick of
<br>
winning an argument is simply to not make it one.  There is little
<br>
enough time to be proactive for the things we care about without be
<br>
reactive to ever bit of anti- fluff that comes down the pike.  Some
<br>
things just are not worth even bothering to refute.  Taking them
<br>
seriously enough to refute them gives them more credit than they
<br>
deserve.  
<br>
<p>I agree it is important to learn how to effectively organize and get the
<br>
message out.  But I think it is far more important to make our own
<br>
message clear and well-engineered memetically first and foremost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  The primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advantages I see [for the luddite point of view]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lie in the question of who does the talking and rule-making in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our societies...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Except that societies themselves and their entire basis is up for such
<br>
radical change that this is a difficult point to even get a handle on.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;the media IS overwhelmingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; staffed with people who lack technical or scientific education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and whose attitudes are shaped by a culture inimical to values of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>True.  So the counteractive to this is education, using the media to the
<br>
extent it can be used and creating new media for the message where it
<br>
cannot. But it does little good to argue scientific points with those
<br>
who do not understand the necessary science and technology.  It can do
<br>
some good to express a different set of sound-bytes but this should
<br>
generally be done proactively instead of in reaction to someone else's
<br>
sound-bytes.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The media probably could not get away with the sort of rubbish that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; published if their audiences were not brain-paralyzed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same can be said of politicians. Their power is derived from people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sit passively by and accept any sort of foolishness rather than risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking for themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am beginning to think that the heart of the problem is a value problem
<br>
rather than a logic and thinking problem.  Without a sense of value, a
<br>
vision, if everything is really without any but a subjective meaning,
<br>
many people simply will see no reason to put forth the effort of
<br>
thinking or planning or caring very much.  What for?  So they can earn
<br>
more to buy more trinkets that they will wonder why they bought them an
<br>
hour or day or week after they take them home?  To make a world where
<br>
they can live much longer lives to spend in the same relatively
<br>
value-less way as they have now?  To enable more and better trinkets to
<br>
be made ever faster and more people to be engaged in the game of trinket
<br>
production and distribution so that more may be able to buy the
<br>
trinkets?  None of those things are very inspiring.  People will turn
<br>
their minds off or become fundies or New Agers or simply become cynical
<br>
and generally angry if they have no value base, no dream or vision of
<br>
what they are living and working for and what is possible.  I think the
<br>
largest challenge in front of us is to build and disseminate such a
<br>
vision.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Greg says:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;... you have a deck that is stacked decidedly against rational development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; science and technology policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;...as the history of the last 250 years in the West has proven,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technological business enterprises produce tangible results in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; efficient manner that many people want and will pay for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is the answer. Most people WANT the benefits of technology:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lights, heating, power tools and appliances, cars, abundant food, medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care, youthful bodies, and so forth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people can't think for themselves, but they can usually follow a line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reasoning if it's set forth step by step. And the anti-tech people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been doing this for years.
</em><br>
<p>We need better memetic engineers on this side.  Rationality alone is not
<br>
enough even if you could firmly establish it on a vast scale. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In order to make a rational counter argument, one must acknowledge that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what the anti-tech people say is true. Not to do so makes you look like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're either stupid or a liar.
</em><br>
<p>Acknowledge true questions and problems but don't simply react.  Show a
<br>
dream that is doable that is larger than the problems and, if it is
<br>
acheived in whole or part, will address the problems to the level that
<br>
can and should be addressed. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Quality of life HAS deteriorated because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air and water pollution and the paving over of vast amounts of land. Whole
</em><br>
<p>Actually, since the 70s air and water pollution is significantly
<br>
improved in the industrialized nations.  Nor do I agree that paving is
<br>
so vast or so significant a problem as to derail technology.  I don't
<br>
agree at all that science or technology are to blame.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; species ARE dying off. Agriculture IS being practiced in a way that has
</em><br>
<p>Whole species are ALWAYS dying off.  This does not mean that we should
<br>
not be concerned if our actions are killing off too many, but just that
<br>
in and off itself it is no condemnation of technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; destroyed and continues to destroy top soil at an alarming rate--you can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this for yourself simply by going out into a cultivated field and picking up
</em><br>
<p>Without scientific agriculture, the Green Revolution, we would have lost
<br>
a tremendously larger amount of fertile topsoil and would have
<br>
experienced much more massive starvation.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the cement-like clods almost entirely devoid of organic matter--and you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not thinking things through if you counter that by saying that hydroponics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or nanotechnology will solve the problem. Along with loss of biological
</em><br>
<p>NT would solve the problem quite handily actually.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; diversity, there HAS been great loss of cultural diversity and great loss of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic diversity as well. The global economy HAS killed off small
</em><br>
<p>Not all cultures will survive when they meet other more vibrant
<br>
cultures. I hardly see that is grounds for being anti-science or
<br>
anti-technology or worth even worrying overly much about. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; manufacturing businesses by the thousands. These particular things the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;luddites&quot; say are TRUE.
</em><br>
<p>So what?  It is to be expected in any healthy economy that capital and
<br>
profitability will shift.  Why is this a condemnation at all?  As long
<br>
as the displaced can still live and thrive then why would we care? 
<br>
Today they can't necessarily and I agree this is a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is NOT true is that technology per se is to blame for the current state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the world. The way to counter the argument that technology is bad is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show people that there are ways of having the good without such a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of bad. One of the best ways to do this is through stories where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can show people concrete examples of how different social systems work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again you come up against the separation of the sciences and the arts. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream movies and novels I've come across lately seem to dwell on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangers of technology. Popular song lyrics are mostly pessimistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>A lot of this is the cultural value problem rather than simply pro- and
<br>
anti-technological sentiments.  Addressing it as a technology issue only
<br>
or a pro/anti debate only misses, imho, what is actually the real
<br>
problem.  That is part of what I mean about reacting.  Even doing a good
<br>
job of &quot;defending&quot; technology will not win if the real problem is deeper
<br>
than simply not understanding technology and making it the scapegoat.  
<br>
<p>Now, one of the things that does need to be addressed that does and will
<br>
ever-increasingly fuel a fear of technology is what sort of world we
<br>
will use the technology to create and how we will all be able to partake
<br>
of that world, we and our children.  There is legitimate cause for great
<br>
concern there.  It deserves honest answers.  If the answers are that
<br>
most of the people asking haven't a prayer then you can bet that they
<br>
will oppose technology quite strongly!  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; The simple facts are that the kinds of people who are drawn into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and technical fields tend to be TERRIBLE communicators in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have an impact on the culture at large.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder why this is. Wish we could talk about this on the list and figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it out. It hasn't always been so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't even particularly think it is true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Even getting the people who could afford to fund the grooming of good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spokespeople to recognize the need seems to be an uphill task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is something the people on this list could begin to remedy immediately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beginning with each person funding their own grooming (funding in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time as well as money).
</em><br>
<p>That I am doing.  I am working on ways to address what I see as the crux
<br>
of the matter and to enroll people in creating (envisioning and
<br>
producing) a positive, livable and quite enticing and activating future
<br>
for all.  Along the way I will work on skills to reach people in a
<br>
variety of ways.  More on that as it progresses.
