</em><br>
<p>**Okay--but the whole thing takes place inside a computer designed, 
<br>
built, and powered by us. That is their universe; we are their &quot;God.&quot; 
<br>
We created them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The stuff we change is usually either because we are working on something
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll just throw in an unrelated argument against design (as opposed to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; vaunted eye, far from being the miracle of creation, is quite flawed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dodgy. DNA itself seems to be a fairly klunky thing in whole, likewise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons and a bazillion other biological mechanisms. There's no wheel, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gears/levers, all kinds of stuff missing from the &quot;natural&quot; world. If it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand designed, it's done pretty poorly.
</em><br>
<p>**Possible that's necessary for some reason--to maintain 
<br>
flexibility/adaptability, for example. Could just be accumulated 
<br>
oddities, of course.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If it doesn't affect us at all, then by Occam's razor we cannot consider it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it is of no useful purpose.
</em><br>
<p>**Ah--but Man's reach SHOULD exceed his grasp...
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;The intangible is pure conjecture, by
<br>
<em>&gt; definition.
</em><br>
<p>**Of course. (Most would call emotions intangible--yet they affect us 
<br>
profoundly.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it does affect us, we must at some point be able to detect it. Yet again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whilst we can find no reasonable purpose to presuppose a &quot;supernatural&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meddler, we must presume there is not one. If we can detect it, then we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another ball game. This is not currently the case.
</em><br>
<p>**I claim nothing to be supernatural. The supernatural, by 
<br>
definition, cannot exist.I also claim no meddler.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know it sounds terribly banal of me to be so utilitarian. But consider; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what purpose do we assume an interfering external entity, when we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence?
</em><br>
<p>**Not external.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What can we do if we allow this? Nothing. If we cannot predict
<br>
<em>&gt; it's actions, we cannot predict the universe. People can make wild claims of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding its actions, and we cannot refute them. Kind of dumb, if there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no evidence.
</em><br>
<p>**Yes. I'm not TRYING to make wild claims. I don't even recall how I 
<br>
got onto this tack. I see design; others don't. As you say, largely 
<br>
irrelevant to our current endeavors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the physical laws of the universe somehow embody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is some extra thing which guides their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (assumedly capricious)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; application?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **I believe (note use of word &quot;believe&quot;) that at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very least, something consciously determined the rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by which the game would be played, and then set it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into motion. Whether that something is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; around..(?) Why not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fair enough. That question about whether or not something consciously kicked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole thing off does not have a clear answer, or maybe any credible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer at this point. It might even be the wrong question. So pick your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorite.
</em><br>
<p>**   :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The conscious directing entity is also a victim of William of Occam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pronouncement.
</em><br>
<p>**This I love. William would be quite pleased at his importance.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;We have been able to show that the laws of physics model
<br>
<em>&gt; reality to a useful degree; coming back to the case in point, the utility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the theory of natural selection in many areas, amongst them biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution, is not in doubt. So we either assume those laws (plus stuff we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know yet) on their own, or we assume them + CDE. There is no way as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet to say which way is &quot;true&quot;, but CDE has not shown it's utility. So it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out.
</em><br>
<p>**Believe it or not, I do understand all of this, really. (Very 
<br>
nicely put, though--much better than the texts I've read.) I simply--
<br>
very unscientifically and very instinctively--state that it is not 
<br>
enough. When I'm talking nanotech, find--hard science alll the way; 
<br>
no room for anything else.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Well, we came from somewhere. A fairly mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; view is that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; massively unlikely, in fact; however, there's a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe out there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a long, long time; on that scale, it becomes more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probable that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; somewhen, this kind of improbable event could occur.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **AACCKKK!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not up to par. I assume you mean &quot;that doesn't suit me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aesthetically&quot;. You have to explain why (your specific objection), and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your alternative is.
</em><br>
<p>**It's the Big Dodge again. But I think we've beaten this issue about 
<br>
to death here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;On the other hand, the probability does not come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; play. By the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anthropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principle, we are going to be us, intelligent life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because what else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be? If we had never existed, that might say something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of us existing. Our existence, however, does not say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we are possible. It is not possible to estimate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; turn,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our origin does not have to be probable. Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **Double AAACCKKK!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, explain yourself. That's a cogent argument, which you have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>**See above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This doesn't really explain anything; there is a whiff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of trolldom in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; air.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **No; you know what it is, really? I've been spending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; too much time around idiots, and then I tuned in to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this place. Perhaps I'm overcompensating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a tough crowd, I'll give you that. 
</em><br>
<p>**Hey but it's a BRIGHT crowd...
<br>
<p><p><p>This is a pet topic too; the burden
<br>
<em>&gt; of argument lies on you, however unfair that might seem.
</em><br>
<p>**Again, this particular issue is, for the moment, philosophy. An AI 
<br>
would have no problem with a purely mechanistic view of creation and 
<br>
development. As a human, transhuman, whatever--I have a problem with 
<br>
it. I suspect many do--many scientists included--but they keep their 
<br>
mouths shut for obvious reasons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **We must become more than we are to find out. That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what this is about, yes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe. More than we are will be fun... that's my motivation; basically quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ego-driven. Quite possibly we could find out everything without changing at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, eventually. But we keep finding out very cool things on the way; things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cry out to be applied. I think I'm a transhumanist because I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed to be, because a long time ago it turned out to be useful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think and make tools, so I was programmed (by natural selection) to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kick out of these things.
