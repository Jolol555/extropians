EMP doesn't imply scorching the Earth, though it's not totally out of
<br>
the question. And no, EMP per se is an electromagnetic effect, not a
<br>
&quot;heavy particles&quot; one; heavy particles are a separate deal from EMP,
<br>
though they can indeed be a bad thing, and strong enough X-radiation can
<br>
induce them. 
<br>
<p>Off-the-cuff summary (anyone who knows more than I, please correct me if
<br>
I err):
<br>
<p>In open literature on the subject, there are two primary types:
<br>
Atmospheric (AEMP) and System (SEMP). Nuclear EMP (NEMP) can induce
<br>
both, depending on distance and other factors.
<br>
<p>When a nuke explodes, there is a short (perhaps 200 nanosecond duration)
<br>
very strong pulse of extremely shortwave radiation (hard X-rays or gamma
<br>
photons, whichever you choose to call them). As this ionizing radiation
<br>
encounters normal matter, the matter is strongly stimulated (ionized).
<br>
The combination of freed electrons, photons emitted as electrons falling
<br>
back to nearer their ground states, and &quot;downshifted&quot; photons due to
<br>
Rayleigh scattering of the original gamma constitutes EMP.
<br>
<p>AEMP is the atmospheric effect, which takes the form of very wideband
<br>
radio from DC to well past daylight. Signal levels can reach many
<br>
kilovolts per meter. Very unpleasant for anything with an antenna or
<br>
wiring that can act like one, since typical signal levels for radio
<br>
inout stages are microvolts, and regular telephone service is designed
<br>
for a ring voltage of 98 V RMS. It's like lightning hitting all over the
<br>
place at once.
<br>
<p>SEMP is where the gamma hits a system pretty much directly, without much
<br>
intervening atmospheric effect. Here, &quot;bremmstrahlung&quot; (electrons being
<br>
knocked out by fast photons) happens right inside the system, with
<br>
similar deleterious effects. Note that a conventional Faraday cage
<br>
shield might provide some protection from AEMP, but is not very
<br>
effective against SEMP.
