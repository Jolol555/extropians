</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm trying to remember the appropriate quote from &quot;A Deepness in the
<br>
Sky&quot; -- something along the lines of &quot;one of the strongest predictors
<br>
of the collapse of civilization in a solar system was the development
<br>
and deployment of ubiquitous surveillance technology&quot;.
<br>
<p>As a point of note, the face recognition stuff deployed at the
<br>
Superbowl sounds very like a system the police have been testing in
<br>
Lewisham, London, for the past couple of years. I'd be surprised if
<br>
England -- starting with London -- isn't saturated with networked
<br>
cameras equipped with a modicum of face-recognition talent within the
<br>
next decade; they're already putting mobile cameras on buses as well as
<br>
the static-mounted cameras on buildings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We might see a desire to extend physical control into the virtual world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as with proposals that people submit to surveillance of their online
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities, use encryption which can be broken by the government, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In recent years we have been moving away from these proposals, but this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, we could see that the libertarian electronic world undermines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the authoritative physical one, as more of the economy becomes based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on information.  People would engage in economic transactions which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical world can't monitor, and more importantly, can't tax.  This was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original cypherpunk model but it remains to be seen whether this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could actually work.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We're seeing an arms race gearing up right now. The sides in the
<br>
arms race are the intellectual property conglomerates -- publishers,
<br>
basically -- and the open source movement. There's a nasty streak of
<br>
absolutism in some recent US laws (the Digital Millennium Copyright
<br>
Act is a classic example) that tend to restrict rights; this is backed
<br>
up by various international bodies contemplating changes in copyright
<br>
conventions that are disproportionately favourable to large corporations
<br>
(at the expense of customary rights of access). These organisations are
<br>
backing technologies like SDMI which are intended to provide seamless,
<br>
wall-to-wall copy prevention from the hardware level up. On the other
<br>
hand ...
<br>
<p>If you put *this* <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010118.html">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010118.html</a>
<br>
together with *this* <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/16348.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/16348.html</a>
<br>
(purely by way of substantiation that Cringely isn't _purely_ spouting
<br>
hot air) and *this* <a href="http://www.opencores.org/">http://www.opencores.org/</a> ... 
<br>
<p>We have the prospect, in a few years or so, of being able to print
<br>
off new cheap-as-paper computers that are open source in every respect
<br>
-- including the hardware and processors. As long as it's possible to
<br>
physically plug them into today's networks, it will be possible to defeat
<br>
the totalitarian power-grab of the copyright absolutists.
<br>
<p>The trouble is,  they're succeeding (by distortion of language and tactics
<br>
that boil down to lying) in conflating copyright violation with much
<br>
more serious crimes. Think before you use the term &quot;piracy&quot; to refer to
<br>
someone who copies a piece of software -- is what they're doing *really*
<br>
in the same league as hijacking a ship, stealing its contents, and raping
<br>
or murdering the passengers and crew?
<br>
<p>One particularly mendacious tactic is to place an unsubstantiated but high
<br>
valuation on a piece of information. For example, ISTR Kevin Mitnick was
<br>
found to have downloaded a chunk of source code for a commercial UNIX
<br>
utility while breaking into some corporate computers. The police asked
<br>
the company what it was worth: they went to AT&amp;T and said &quot;what's this
<br>
UNIX thing worth?&quot; and AT&amp;T said &quot;seventy million dollars&quot;. So that's
<br>
what Mitnick was charged with stealing -- completely ignoring the fact
<br>
that if they'd gone to the Free Software Foundation they could have
<br>
found functionally-identical software available for free!
<br>
<p>This may well be symptomatic of a side-effect of our culture's move into
<br>
an information economy: our core values are changing, and there's
<br>
feedback from our concept of ownership. If software is 100% proprietary,
<br>
commercial, trade secret material, people can be charged with multi-
<br>
million dollar thefts for posession of the source code to &quot;grep&quot;. On the
<br>
other hand, if software is free, there is no crime to prosecute in the
<br>
first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Looking out farther, we have to throw nanotech into the mix, which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretically expand the range of things you could construct at home using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just information.  And before that we will be faced with &quot;bathtub biotech&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is on the horizon if not here already, allowing people to cook up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own biotech cocktails at home using information found on the net.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you feel about this Orwell/libertarian world?  Does the existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of virtual freedom compensate for the possibility of increased social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control outside your home?  And do you think it would be stable, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would one side or the other win out?
</em><br>
<p>I want to be free. I want access to information. I want privacy. There are
<br>
strong pressures to deprive me (and you) of all of these capabilities:
<br>
but assuming they're pressures arising from government is a dangerous,
<br>
and ultimately fatal, mistake. The pressures arise from existing power
<br>
structures, some of which are bureaucratic empires within government
<br>
departmenrs (seeking to perpetuate their employment) and others of which
<br>
exist in the private sector. As our (and their) value system changes,
<br>
that which nobody paid any attention to before (and which was therefore
<br>
free) becomes perceived as valuable. So a power grab is in progress. The
<br>
history of the past century doesn't encourage me to believe that the
<br>
little guys will win; if anything, the last half-century has seen the
<br>
triumph of marketing over individualism in the developed world.
