Nice thought, but I'm afraid not. They'll simply jam the suckers.

<em>&gt; This kinda problem is easily solved with a video camera which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a transmitter so that the recording device is not on the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so cannot be confiscated.  The real trick is to make a standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; video camera with a transmitter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After the cops learn of the existence of transmitter cameras that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look like standard ones, they would be unable to tell the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wouldnt wanna chance it, so anyone with any camera would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause them to play by the rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the next logical step is a camera too small to be seen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then no one knows who is packing tape.  A polite society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results.  Of course it makes one a little squicked when one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showers in the locker room.  But why should it?  Why did
