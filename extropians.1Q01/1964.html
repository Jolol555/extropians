<em>&gt; &gt; It is up to moral programmers with a vision of how we could do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things far better than we do now to choose the tools that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe are the best and to use those successfully on enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; projects to give them continuing life and dominance and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make room to develop the next set of tools and the next after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that until we develop tools that take over their own development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; largely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why?  Well because all of our dreams on this list are dependent on
<br>
computers working really well and being quite responsive and
<br>
dependable.  In short they are dependent on software.  The forces of the
<br>
market once software is considered something to own, lock down and dole
<br>
out licenses to result in extremely brittle and undependable software
<br>
(without mentioning all the other ills this brings about).  We have a
<br>
tremendous software crunch where we do not have the technological means
<br>
to quickly and dependably produce software to meet the software demand
<br>
much less produce really good human mind-augmentation tools that are
<br>
desperately needed.  
<br>
<p>A critical mass of people that understand where we are and are willing
<br>
to do what they can to move the software situation in a more desirable
<br>
direction is pretty essential.  Ultimately we need to build software
<br>
that learns to build, modify and extend itself.  This is one of the
<br>
crucial steps toward SI.  It has often been said that programmers expend
<br>
a great deal of energy automating everyone else's work but their own. 
<br>
There are market reasons this is so.  This must change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Sorry to intervene, but this is quite a strong statement, and I'm tempted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn where your motivation comes from. It seems you have an awful lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy and desire to change things - even after quite a few years of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around, as I infer from your message. I wonder how you manage to hold on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that energy? Also, note that I'm not saying your energy is good or bad, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be either - Martin Luther King Jr had this kind of energy and it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good, but Hitler had it as well and it was bad.]
</em><br>
<p>It is in part precisely because I have been around so long and seen so
<br>
much of the underbelly of software production that I do have so much
<br>
energy and desire to change things. The knowledge of what needs to be
<br>
stays around and becomes ever more inescapable. Actually moving
<br>
congruently with that knowledge is much more difficult.  But I've become
<br>
enough of a goddess in particular areas to over time be able to sell
<br>
employers on doing projects that add to what I believe needs to be done
<br>
or develop some subpiece while satisfying their own needs. This has been
<br>
a difficult balancing act.  After my current committments are cleared I
<br>
plan to go at this work more directly.  More about that as I further
<br>
develop and work out my plans.
