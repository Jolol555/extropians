<em>&gt;   A conlang (similar in principle to loglan/Lojban, though aimed towards a

<em>&gt;   You could take advantage of the Sapir-Worf hypothesis (essentially

<em>&gt; language shapes cognition), and structure the brood's language in such a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the identity barriers were intrinsically blurred.  Multiple prounouns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and careful vocabulary selection would be indicated. Inclusion of modalities
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;difference&quot; between the Brood and others. why force kids to make up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secret language..give it to them. :)
</em><br>
<p>Problem: if they only use this language to talk to each other (since no
<br>
one else speaks it), what's to stop them from simplifying to use their
<br>
everyday language to talk to each other?  And if one does it before the
<br>
others, would that not induce concepts of individualiaty?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   You might encourage the children to think of the other Brood members as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;extensions of themselves&quot; from the earliest months.  The ultimate goal here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;he looks just like me, so he is (essentially) Me&quot;.  The aims would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological gestualt, extreme empathy, and the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pseudotelepathy (something that seems psychic, even though it's just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skill).
</em><br>
<p>Problem: differentiation between that which one can control with one's
<br>
own thoughts, and that which one can not so control.  Even with extreme
<br>
empathy and so forth, one does not have more actual physical connection
<br>
(as opposed to relational and emotional connections) with one's clones
<br>
than with any random human...unless you start out with, say, a
<br>
radiotelepathy implant or somesuch (as opposed to waiting for them to
<br>
be developed better).
<br>
<p>Also, how do you reconcile different units' experiences?  If one
<br>
happens to be luckier than another at a certain game, then one will
<br>
approach the next play of that game with more positive expectations
<br>
than the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   The weird thing about all this is it sounds doable...without waiting for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nano to allow you to upload or download your mind and into a waiting clone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body.
</em><br>
<p>It does sound doable...but a quick check: if it is doable, why aren't
<br>
we doing it now (or, if we just thought of it, why don't we start now)?
<br>
The answer is, more often than not, the niggling detail of reality that
<br>
makes it non-doable.  (Which, in this case, might just be that no one
<br>
yet has both the money and time to pull this off and the idea to do
<br>
this.)
