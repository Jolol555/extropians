<p><em>&gt; It's really not what you'd call a &quot;fast&quot; movie, y'know.  2001 dates from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  time when movies were much, much more slower-paced.  That sequence at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  end alone... trying to watch &quot;2001&quot; after &quot;The Matrix&quot; is like trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  watch &quot;Psycho&quot; after &quot;Hellraiser II&quot;.  You sit there and just marvel at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the idea that this was once cutting-edge; that people could think of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  movie as being anything but homey, wholesome, and relaxing.  You do it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the historical value and to just appreciate how different things must have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  been a couple of generations ago.  If 2001 were released today, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  flop.  How can you demand of my generation that they watch it?
</em><br>
<p>I confess that this comment from you, Eliezer, set my teeth on edge.  I used 
<br>
to joke that I was unable to carry on a conversation with someone born after 
<br>
Apollo 11 because I lacked sufficient common cultural referents.  This 
<br>
stopped being funny this year when my in-coming class of newly-minted 
<br>
associate attorneys turned out to be born after *Apollo 17*, i.e. after the 
<br>
LAST human walked on the moon.
<br>
<p>The underlying issue is important for extropians because we're interested in 
<br>
the phenomena of accelerating scientific, technological and cultural change.  
<br>
It has been said that transhumanists in general and extropians in particular 
<br>
are neophiles, and this is true, up to a point.  But there's an important 
<br>
converse to our neophilia and that is that the faster things change, the 
<br>
harder we have to work to mine and refine what's good in our cultural past, 
<br>
because the risk of losing something of value grows with the pace of 
<br>
innovation.
<br>
<p>You think &quot;2001&quot; is a &quot;slow&quot; film?  Try watching Kubrick's unsung 
<br>
masterpiece, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;!  (My take on the movie when I first saw it some 
<br>
25 years ago: &quot;How people would have made movies in the 18th Century if 
<br>
they'd had the technology.&quot;)  That &quot;2001&quot; would be a flop if it were released 
<br>
today is not necessarily a GOOD thing.  Some things - say, telling a story 
<br>
that encompasses the sweep of 4 million years of deep time - can't be done 
<br>
quickly, or at least not done well.  Imagine trying to tell the story of 
<br>
&quot;2001&quot; MTV-style.  Now consider whether we should uncritically embrace every 
<br>
cultural change, when it may carry with it the inevitable loss of artistic 
<br>
vocabulary to express important ideas.  Consider taking a pit stop during the 
<br>
race into the future to stop and smell some roses from ages gone by.
