Silver bullet it ain't, but there's truth to it.

<p>The following was written by John Robb, President and founder of
<br>
www.gomez.com , and I found it at
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/the2xInternet">http://www.thetwowayweb.com/the2xInternet</a>
<br>
<p>At this point, I really don't think it's possible to stop the Two-Way
<br>
Web from happening.  It's just a question of when and how we reach the
<br>
tipping point.
<br>
<p>2WW is just beginning to tickle the imaginations of some of the most
<br>
brilliant people in the world.  What an exciting time to be involved.
<br>
What an exciting time to be committed.
<br>
<p>I do believe we're on the cusp of another phenomenon in which a very
<br>
small number of people have the opportunity to guide something with very
<br>
large consequences.  I hope we have the wisdom to make the right
<br>
choices, and the agility to adapt to a rapid-feedback virtuous cycle.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The 2X (two way) Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Internet is undergoing a transformation to a new system that scales
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, costs less, and provides better end-user performance than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Web. Gomez calls this new system the 2X (two-way) Internet. We believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the arrival of the 2X Internet is as momentous an occasion as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrival of the Web and is what's necessary to achieve global customer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adoption of the Internet as a means of doing business. Here are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics of the 2X Internet. It's:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Local. The 2X Internet relies on the ability of desktop PCs to do much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the work necessary to actually assemble and serve a complex Web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; site. Contrast this to how the Web squanders PC power by only retrieving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rendering pages that are pre-masticated by large corporate servers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Global. Rather than interconnect with singular large corporate sites,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 2X Internet will rely on customers to connect to a global network of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; servers that run highly distributed applications. In this model, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions are made with local servers that are part of a global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network. No more will customers be forced to interact with services that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are time zones away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Metered. All interactions on the 2X Internet will be metered, analyzed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and charged to customers. Due to the infrastructure needed and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of the interactions, business models based on free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions will be cast aside in favor of a fee for service model.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How the 2X Internet will fix the Web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The 2X Internet has the power to transform the mediocre experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Web into a vibrant, rich, experience that drives customer adoption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Internet as the preferred way of doing business. Here's what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went wrong with the Web and what the 2X Internet will do to correct it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's slow. Customer productivity drops dramatically when response times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are longer than a second. Times are 7-10 seconds on the Web and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structural issues will prevent all improvement. The 2X Internet speeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the customer's response times by using a server located on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customer's PC to connect to XML-enabled data services provided by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local servers in the 2X Internet global &quot;cloud.&quot; The short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distances traveled and the power of dedicated local resources will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radically improve customer productivity by making interactivity sub second!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's expensive. Monster clusters of servers and oversized switches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costing tens of millions $$ (with huge staffs to match) run most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporate Web efforts. By distributing applications and data across a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global network of small, inexpensive servers and allowing the customer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own desktop PC to share in the burden of computation, costs drop radically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It can't scale. Web sites scale horribly when faced with hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of users doing complex tasks. By dividing the task of enabling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transaction over a global network of servers and the PC resources of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of customers, the 2X Internet solves the scalability problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Rise of the 2X Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Over the next three years, the infrastructure of the 2X Web will explode
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onto the Internet, accompanied by rapidly expanding bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (particularly in the all optical core) and plummeting storage costs. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will serve as the basis for the next great technology companies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will push aside the aging PC world players and will breathe life into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moribund, financially strapped, online content world. Here is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxonomy of the 2X Internet:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Global backbones that provide XML dial tone, desktop servlets, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly distributed applications will emerge and begin to fill the roll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to customers what the telcos did in the pre-Internet world. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backbone providers will not arise out of the Telco or hosting world but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather will be new names, such as Neoplat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New innovative software from companies such as Centrata, KnowNow, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Applied MetaComputing will enable independent software vendors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly develop, globally deploy, and easily manage their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software. Microsoft will play a very large part of this revolution too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with its .Net infrastructure, but it will likely be late to the party
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a ferocious competitor when it arrives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Applications engineered for the 2X Internet will quickly dominate. Web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enabled apps and will be quickly outgunned in all the major areas of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluation: functionality, ease of use, cost, and performance by the 2X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet apps. Names such as Groove, Userland, and Rotor may become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonplace in the delivery of these services.

<p>CGI happened. Strange thing... as much as I love what computers can do
for me, and the very foundation of my creative talents is based around a
keyboard and a brain, I can't help but think that computers are
destroying a very important part of humankind as a whole: emotions and
the expression of that emotion.  And so it goes.
