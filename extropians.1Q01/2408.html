As suggested, here's what I found after following a few leads. It's a 
<br>
summary of UK law on knifes (couldn't find anything on batons) and comes 
<br>
from the website of a knifes/tools company called Gerber. The interesting 
<br>
bit is this: &quot;It is an offence for any person to have with him in a public 
<br>
place, an article which is sharply pointed or with a blade, other than a 
<br>
folding pocket knife with a blade not exceeding three inches, (7.7cm)&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>The law with regard to knives is fairly straight forward and is encompassed 
<br>
within these two pieces of legislation:
<br>
<p>OFFENSIVE WEAPON
<br>
Prevention Of Crime Act 1953
<br>
<p>Section 1
<br>
Any Person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, the proof 
<br>
whereof lies with him,
<br>
has with him in any public place, any offensive weapon, is guilty of an 
<br>
offence.
<br>
<p>POINTS &amp; BLADES
<br>
Criminal Justice Act 1953
<br>
<p>Section 139
<br>
It is an offence for any person to have with him in a public place, an 
<br>
article which is sharply
<br>
pointed or with a blade, other than a folding pocket knife with a blade not 
<br>
exceeding three inches, (7.7cm) without lawful authority or reasonable 
<br>
excuse, the proof whereof lies with him, is guilty of an offence.
<br>
<p>Reasonable excuse would be if the knife is used as a part of your equipment 
<br>
or in connection
<br>
with your profession. This would not include carrying it outside your 
<br>
employment. You can ask
<br>
yourself a simple question regarding knives. Would the average person feel 
<br>
that the excuse given
<br>
is a reasonable one and can you prove your reasonable excuse.
