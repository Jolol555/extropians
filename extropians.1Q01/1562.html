<p><em>&gt; **Actually, quantum theory sounds a whole lot kookier than Velikovsky-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -but it does seem to be correct. And I refuse to discount a theory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based upon the opinion and characterizations of an individual who has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examined said theory for a total of 4.3 seconds.
</em><br>
<p>If you judge theories on how they sound, then you are going to make
<br>
many mistakes. Instead look at their predictions. Does it look like
<br>
all known orbital mechanics is dead wrong, the laws of thermodynamics,
<br>
energy conservation and momentum conservation are disobeyed by
<br>
planetary masses and that every culture in the world except for the
<br>
one at ground zero suffers collective amnesia of dramatic
<br>
world-spanning events? Also, consider whether they can be falsified -
<br>
can you prove that Velikovsky's cosmic billiards did not happen when
<br>
he can (in principle, since he is dead) always blame lack of evidence
<br>
or contradictions on collective amnesia, changes in physics or
<br>
catastrophes being brief. I guess this may take longer to evaluate
<br>
than 4.3 seconds, but not much longer.
<br>
<p>If you do the same with quantum mechanics you get completely different
<br>
answers. They might be weird, but they actually fit with known facts,
<br>
only change the previously known laws of physics at certain scales and
<br>
the whole theory is quite falsifiable. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *&quot;I have already carefully read the first volume of the memoirs to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; “Worlds in Collision,” and have supplied it with a few marginal notes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in pencil that can be easily erased...&quot; --Albert Einstein, letter to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Immanuel Velikovsky, March 17, 1955 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Apparently Mr. Einstein thought the matter warranted a wee bit more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 4.3 seconds of &quot;his&quot; time--though it must be said that he did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not support the Venus contention, and found parts of V's works to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanciful, as of 1954-55.
</em><br>
<p>Do you know that followers of Willhelm Reich also claim that Einsteing
<br>
approved of his theories of orgone power? The real story is that Reich
<br>
often dragged over his neighbour in Princeton (?) to show his latest
<br>
gadgets like orgone boxes and cloud/anti-UFO cannons, and the
<br>
peace-loving Einstein never had the heart to tell him he was a
<br>
crank. So his followers now claim Einstein supported Reich. 
<br>
<p>Anyway, even if Einstein had been the greatest admirer of Velikovsky
<br>
it doesn't improve the validity of his theories one bit. Arguments of
<br>
authority have no place in science. 
<br>
<p>Even an infinite posthuman lifespan is not long enough to consider all
<br>
forms of junk thinking - the cardinality of the set of incoherent,
<br>
unsupported or nonfalsifiable ideas is much larger than the
<br>
cardinality of its complement.
