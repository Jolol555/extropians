<p>Why? I didn't volunteer to live in this world. Given my druthers, I'd be
<br>
born 10-20 years in the future, if not more, with higher intelligence, a
<br>
better physique, and no astigmatism. Nobody else has any more right to
<br>
'volunteer' to be born where and when and as what they want. The only
<br>
thing unethical is engineering a person poorly. They must be designed as
<br>
well as possible for the environment intended: higher oxygen scavenging
<br>
ability, tolerance of low pressure, high UV radiation, low humidity, and
<br>
1/3 gravity. Failing to do so is the only thing that is unethical.
<br>
<p>Breeding dogs to be better hunters for their intended environment is
<br>
entirely ethical, breeding one for the desert and sticking it in the
<br>
arctic is what is unethical. Same goes for people.
