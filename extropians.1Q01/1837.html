<p>Very interesting.
<br>
<p>[Did some research: these statistics seem to be marketed primarily by
<br>
firearms owners, and organizations like National Rifle Association, which
<br>
might be a bit biased. But I believe the numbers.]
<br>
<p>Come to think of it, these results might not be that difficult to explain.
<br>
There are a bunch of criminals who earlier had weapons, but they might have
<br>
been afraid to use them against a random target because the target might
<br>
have been armed as well. Now, they can be quite sure that the target is
<br>
unarmed; hence the increase in their boldness.
<br>
<p>My original message was probably a bit simplistic. I avoided the problem of
<br>
converting a society from one that worships firearms, like America, to one
<br>
that dislikes the sight of them, like us. But the problem is that people in
<br>
the former societies have grown up with guns, and they're not afraid of
<br>
using them - to them, guns seem natural, and a ban on firearms seems
<br>
terribly unnatural. [Quite the opposite of what people in my country would
<br>
think.]
<br>
<p><em> &gt;From the posts to this mailing list, it seems the problem is not only
</em><br>
converting the criminals to fear the sight of a gun, but also at the same
<br>
time to convert the police into being more of an ally rather than an
<br>
adversary. Everyone's basic attitude would have to change... let alone the
<br>
constitution.
<br>
<p>I really don't know how this grand canyon can be bridged in less than a few
<br>
generations' time. So yeah, maybe you do have to stick with threatening to
<br>
shoot each other - at least for the time being.
<br>
<p>[When I visit America, I'll drive around in a tank. :-) ]
