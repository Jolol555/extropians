<p>(Which you only do in theory, but never in practice. You have two parties

that always remain the same. Either one of them always wins. In fact, right

now you have the son of a former president be your chief. Nepotism? No, not
<br>
entirely. But you didn't really have a choice. You only choose the party;
<br>
the party chooses its own candidate. Your country is actually a monarchy,
<br>
only you don't see it, because the two families in charge trade places every
<br>
few years.)
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; But please understand that we shed a great deal of blood
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; of the nation, aren't allowed to defend ourselves and our
</em><br>
<em> &gt; nation then who has a better right?
</em><br>
<p>Your argument was very well thought out, and very well executed. I thank you
<br>
for it, because I think you've voiced the concept very clearly - more
<br>
clearly than anyone else in this thread, I think.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, your argument was an emotional one. It was your response to my
<br>
original statement, which was:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; So, I don't think America's aversion against banning guns has any
<br>
rational structure at all. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The statement is true. America's aversion against banning guns does not have
<br>
a rational structure. What it has is an emotional structure, and a very
<br>
strong one.
<br>
<p><p>Also, I gathered the impression that you think I don't grok what democracy
<br>
is in the first place. We have one here, and I think we the citizens have
<br>
more or less the very same powers you have over there. It's only our
<br>
background that is different.
<br>
<p>In particular, judging by the emotions in your message, I'd say you have
<br>
much more &quot;Nationality Education&quot; than we have here. Unless you somehow
<br>
manage to be several hundred years old, you didn't actually shed blood
<br>
yourself for the system you live in; someone else gave you the impression
<br>
that the system is worth a lot. (I agree, it is.) But that's called
<br>
indoctrination, and it is a method for the government to implant seemingly
<br>
correct, but subtly mistaken ideas into the minds of their people. We've had
<br>
quite enough of that here between 1945 and 1990. [So now I'm having none of
<br>
it.]
