On Sat, 6 Jan 2001, Steve Van Sickle quoted Doug Jones, who wrote : 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; spreadsheet for Rotary Rocket). Secondly, while the bulk density of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; body is about 1, the lungs and other air filled spaces are &lt;&lt;1, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would experience very strong buoyancy effects. At more than 25 gees 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this would be likely to cause tearing of lung tissue. Also, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hydrostatic pressure at the lowest point in the lungs would be far 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; higher than the gas pressure in the lungs leading to edema as liquids 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; leak through the walls of the alveoli. In tests, healthy subjects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; immersed in water were able to take about ten gees for about fifteen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; minutes before losing consciousness. 
</em><br>
<p>Then Steve added:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How about filling the lungs with saline at about the same density? Either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the passenger could be placed in profound hypothermia and so do without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;oxygen (or a heartbeat, for that matter) for 30 or 40 minutes, or have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blood oxygenated by a heart/lung machine. 
</em><br>
<p>Excellent posts, Doug and Steve.  I anticipated the bouyancy problem you
<br>
mention Doug--note my comment about liquid-breathing apparatus--but didn't
<br>
elaborate on it because it's all something of a flight of fancy.  I was
<br>
seeking the upper bound implied by Brent's original question: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How many gs can a human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stand for extended periods of time? 
</em><br>
<p>So, a bit more then?
<br>
<p>Additional problems include: High Pressure Nervous Syndrome (HPNS), which
<br>
results from an overly fast rate of compression; and, of course,
<br>
decompression complications.  
<br>
<p>For a diver, HPNS is bad news because he has to function as a worker, not
<br>
to mention survive in a hazardous environment, but for an astronaut just
<br>
laying back for the trip, it's not so critical.  I'm not a hundred percent
<br>
certain, but as I recall the theory of HPNS attributes it to mechanical
<br>
distortion--due to compression--of neural cell membranes, and that it can
<br>
be prevented or reversed by administration of anesthesia, which, absorbed
<br>
by the membranes, causes them to swell.  First it restores normal nerve
<br>
function, then, with additional absorbtion and swelling, it puts you to
<br>
sleep.  So to prevent our astronaut from becoming wired to the point of
<br>
seizures--that's what HPNS does to you--we have to medicate him.
<br>
<p>As Steve points out, saline filling the lungs addresses the hydrostatic
<br>
pressure differential/bouyancy problem as it relates to the lungs (and
<br>
other body gas spaces), but introduces the 'drowning' problem.  To counter
<br>
that, Steve proposes profound hypothermia and a heart-lung machine.  Let me
<br>
add that this arrangement also takes care of the decompression problem.  Or
<br>
you can skip the hypothermia, fill the lungs with saline, and just go for a
<br>
'lung' machine.
<br>
<p>Or you can take the hypothermia to the extreme, cryonically vitrify the
<br>
astronaut, turning him/her into a glassy rock, thus achieving some serious
<br>
g-resisting structural strength.  Then you can go REALLY fast.  What's the
<br>
shear strength of the block of diamond that would then serve as the
<br>
supporting 'pressure vessel' for the cryo-astronaut? 
<br>
<p>What with the escalting complexity of life-support with increasing G
<br>
forces, I conclude that one G, a good book, some videos, and a bucket of
<br>
McNuggets will do just fine.  Two days one hour and fifty minutes (at
<br>
mars-to-earth closest approach) is less time than it takes to cross the
<br>
Atlantic by boat, even today.
<br>
<p>By the way, if mars is on the other side of the sun, 2.524 AU from earth,
<br>
the trip time at one G is still only 4 days 13 hours 20 min.  And that's
<br>
not even taking into account the solar slingshot effect. 
<br>
<p>And one last comment.  The rotary rocket engine, the spinning wheel,
<br>
exhaust nozzles at the periphery, dynamic geometric simplicity replacing
<br>
complex and expensive turbopumps, remains for me a concept of breathtaking,
<br>
dazzling elegance.  I am bereft and inconsolable at the thought that it is
<br>
not to be.  Rather, I choose to believe that persons of venality and small
<br>
vision, the spawn which curseth humanity by their abundance, have simply
<br>
postponed the day when that beauty of engineering shall grace the skies.
<br>
Tell me Doug--lie if you have to--that there is still hope.
<br>
