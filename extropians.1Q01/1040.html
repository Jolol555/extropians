<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; They were sold a bill of goods, and bought every word.

<p><em>&gt;Residential local service was always subsidized by long distance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;charges. Now that interstate long distance companies are free of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this, your residential local service is subsidized by in-state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long distance, which still ranges from $0.20-0.39 /minute, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kinda stinks if your computer gets smart and decides to call an

</em><br>
<em>&gt;its local when its not (they got me that way last year: $1200 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a month before I got my bill...)
</em><br>
<p>Disclaimer: My opinions are my own, I do not speak for
<br>
SBC/Ameritech
<br>
<p>We're not allowed to do any long distance, not even interstate, we
<br>
have to by law use another carrier for anything beyond about 12
<br>
miles or so depending on area. We have to use another carrier to
<br>
reach our own headquarters 20 miles away. Unbelievable!
<br>
<p>Heres the fun part, say you live in Chicago, you pay a basic
<br>
service charge of $5.98 or so. It costs us about a dollar less or
<br>
so to provide service so say we make a buck. Now say you live in
<br>
Barrington you pay $13.98 or so for basic service. Now get this, it
<br>
costs us something like 3 times that amount to provide that
<br>
service, the difference comes out of those dollars we make in
<br>
Chicago, and business accounts, which pay more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I say jack up the prices, make people pay for what they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting, then they'll demand something better, and someone will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;willing to give it to them.
</em><br>
<p>You're obviously not a politician. ;) Back in 1991 I was part of a
<br>
program who's stated goal was to put fiber in every Ameritech
<br>
home/business by the year 2000. Then the long distance companies,
<br>
cable companies, state and federal regulators, and CUB (citizens
<br>
utility board) got wind of it and when they were done legislating,
<br>
it wasn't profitable for us as a corporation to build.
<br>
<p><p>The future? if we ever get permission to do long distance, I
<br>
predict flat rate pricing.
