<em>&gt; As much as I hate to wade into this morass, I would suggest the

<em>&gt; destruction of society that comes along with every communist

<em>&gt; revolution.
</em><br>
<p>I was not writing to defend communism, but to point out that the one-liner
<br>
&quot;history shows that communism doesn't work&quot; can be applied to capitalism
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Those of us who lived when the USSR was a powerful force in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world lived with the notion (which I still believe) that communism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot prosper long term alongside capitalism.
</em><br>
<p>There are two problems with this.  First, USSR stands for the Union
<br>
of Soviet Socialist Republics.  Notice that there is no &quot;communism&quot;
<br>
in the name.  Technically the USSR was socialist, not communist.
<br>
<p>Second, as conservatives love to point out, much of the early Socialist
<br>
Party platform has been enacted in the United States, and similar
<br>
provisions exist in most so-called &quot;capitalist&quot; countries.  See
<br>
<a href="http://www.conservativebeacon.com/essays/Socialism/socialist_platform.html">http://www.conservativebeacon.com/essays/Socialism/socialist_platform.html</a>.
<br>
<p>This means that, in a sense, the United States is as much socialist
<br>
as capitalist.  The long conflict between the USSR and the US was not
<br>
an ideological battle between capitalism and communism.  It was a power
<br>
struggle between two socialist nations.
<br>
<p>We should not be blinded by patriotic or ideological propaganda.  We live
<br>
in a mixed society, part capitalist and part socialist.
<br>
