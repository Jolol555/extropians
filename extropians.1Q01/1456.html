<em>&gt; In the heart of Silicon Valley, for example, power demands skyrocketed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last year, while the rest of the state saw an overall increase of 2% to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3%, said John Roukeme, a spokesman for Silicon Valley Power, the municipal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility for the city of Santa Clara, Calif.
</em><br>
<p>Ja that might be part of it.  But the more important factor that John Roukeme
<br>
did not mention is that in Santa Clara the skyrocketing cost of housing in
<br>
that city (and county) has encouraged many homeowners to rent out a
<br>
room or two.  In many cases, if the home owner has been there more than
<br>
about 10 years, the sum paid by the hapless tenant covers the entire
<br>
mortgage with change left over.
<br>
<p>The lefty press cannot bring themselves to admit the real culprit: greenie
<br>
policies have led to voters demanding that no new plants are built.  The
<br>
same voters wish for Sacramento to pass laws that power keep coming
<br>
in at artificially low prices, with no additional air pollution, with
<br>
unlimited
<br>
supply.  In response, our so-called governor gave a state of the state
<br>
address in which he proposed making it a *crime* for power generation
<br>
facilities to withhold power for economic reasons, and even went so far
<br>
as to propose legally seizing power plants.  Perhaps we should call this
<br>
place Kalifornia.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, those of you who live outside Taxifornia, prepare yourselves
<br>
for a treat.  This will be a real hoot, trust me.  Public policy is about
<br>
to make this current fiasco so much worse that a mere debacle will
<br>
very soon develop into a morass from which extrication is impossible.
<br>
<p>Take for instance the electric car business.  The state *mandated*
<br>
that car dealers make 10% of their fleet &quot;zero emission.&quot;  (Hybrid
<br>
cars do not qualify.)  Now where is all that power to come from?
<br>
What about all those electric cars?  Who pays for those?  The
<br>
taxpayers?  Will they now be half the price of a comparable
<br>
gasoline car?  1/3?  If so, I want one.  Furthermore, since I
<br>
must pay anyway, I want the taxpayer to subsidize my power
<br>
bill.
<br>
<p>By the way, if the Taxifornia taxpayer is essentially picking
<br>
up the bill for the power, what if I am off-grid?  Do I still
<br>
hafta pay my taxes?
<br>
<p>Stay tuned.  spike
