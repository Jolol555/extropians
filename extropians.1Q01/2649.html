<p><em>&gt; In a spirit of non-confrontational rationalism, I'd like to see if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can compose a list of ideas that we *ALL* agree on.
</em><br>
<p>A quite good list, which seems to at least work as a least-mena-square
<br>
approximation to what we (active people on this list) agree on.
<br>
<p>We have had a discussion on the Swedish list on whether there exist a
<br>
value system of transhumanism. It seems to me that transhumanism in
<br>
general do not really have any value system that everybdoy agrees on -
<br>
there is a tendency towards humanist-liberal ideas but they are not
<br>
firmly anchored within the system itself. Hence, in order to be able
<br>
to provide an ethics and all the other useful things we get from a
<br>
value system, transhumanism needs to either be included within another
<br>
system with a value system or we need to use a sub-movement with more
<br>
defined principles. Extropianism as expressed in the extropian
<br>
principles is one such subset of transhumanism in general.  Charlies
<br>
list seems to be an even tighter subset with fairly clear ethical
<br>
implications.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If you disagree with any of these memes, could you wave a hand and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Forcing our fellow human beings to live their lives as we see fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    is unethical. (Persuading them of the error of their ways so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    they _choose_ to live their lives by our lights is another matter.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Initiating violence against someone is wrong; self-defense is right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. The scientific method provides a better way of evaluating reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    than any religious dogma.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Progress (increases in human intelligence, longevity, wealth, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    happiness) is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. Central control is usually less efficient than distributed control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6. Empowering people to learn, work, and transcend their limits is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    thing.
</em><br>
<p>I think I agree with all of these, with some slight
<br>
modifications/clarifications like others have proposed. In 3 it would
<br>
be any dogma, in 4 I would like to add cumulative growth of knowledge
<br>
and skill. I have a bit of problem with 5 - it is too general; I think
<br>
I agree more with the statement that distributed control is currently
<br>
undervalued, useful in many situations, more aesthetic than central
<br>
control and when it comes to control of humans, more ethical since it
<br>
is more compatible with 1 rather than coercion.
<br>
<p>However, I think it is important to remember that these are statements
<br>
that are in themselves not axiomatic. I would for example derive 1 and
<br>
2 from the standard libertarian/humanist philosophy about human value
<br>
and rights, 3 as a statement of current empirical knowledge supported
<br>
by the fact that given human fallibility and lack of information a
<br>
dogmatic approach will perpetuate mistakes, and so on. But would other
<br>
list members make the same deductions? I'm not sure. While we can
<br>
certainly work together on the above shared assumptions, underlying
<br>
differences in values might introduce complications.
