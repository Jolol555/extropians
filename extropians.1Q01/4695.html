<p>The Web, Without Wires, Wherever
<br>
<p><p>By GLENN FLEISHMAN
<br>
<p><p>IT'S coming soon to an espresso bar near you.
<br>
<p>And to the rival coffee shop across the street. Not to mention the
<br>
coin-operated laundry on the corner, the hotel on the next block and the
<br>
railroad station across town. The local airport may already have it.
<br>
<p>Wireless high-speed Internet access, a longtime dream of the technophile
<br>
and business traveler, is finally arriving at hundreds of access points
<br>
in
<br>
public and private places across the United States. With a laptop
<br>
computer
<br>
equipped with a wireless card, anyone within a few hundred feet or so of
<br>
one of these access points, or hot spots, can tap into a wireless
<br>
network
<br>
that is in turn connected to the Internet via a broadband connection.
<br>
The
<br>
user can then send e-mail or surf the Web at speeds in the megabit
<br>
range,
<br>
usually for a monthly or single-use fee.
<br>
<p>By late this year, industry experts say, the hundreds of hot spots will
<br>
become thousands as service providers and entrepreneurs install the
<br>
necessary equipment - generally, a small transceiver and a broadband
<br>
connection - in all major airport terminals, sports arenas and other
<br>
business and consumer sites. By sometime next year, one company expects
<br>
to
<br>
have access points in 5,000 Starbucks stores.
<br>
<p>&quot;Roaming mobile access is becoming a hot item,&quot; said Tim Bajarin,
<br>
president
<br>
of Creative Strategies, an industry consulting firm. Mr. Bajarin added
<br>
that
<br>
the services were particularly attractive to corporations who wanted
<br>
their
<br>
traveling staff to be able to keep in touch with the home office more
<br>
frequently.
<br>
<p>Some companies and colleges already have wireless local area networks
<br>
using
<br>
the same technology so Internet and intranet access is available from
<br>
anywhere within an office or around a campus. But the services for
<br>
mobile
<br>
professionals tend to be single access points covering one or more
<br>
stores,
<br>
for instance, or several meeting rooms in a hotel.
<br>
<p>Some of these services may be free, run by volunteers intrigued by the
<br>
community-building prospects of wireless networking. Volunteer efforts
<br>
are
<br>
under way in several cities, including Seattle, Boston and San
<br>
Francisco.
<br>
<p>But most access points are and will be commercial, run by companies that
<br>
will charge for the services - anywhere from a few dollars for a single
<br>
session to $50 or more per month for unlimited use of the system.
<br>
<p>This new wireless access is about &quot;giving you the ability to roam from
<br>
one
<br>
network to another and be blissfully ignorant&quot; of the technical
<br>
intricacies, said Stephen Saltzman, general manager of Intel's wireless
<br>
local area network division. &quot;It's the kind of thing that's such a
<br>
fundamental capability that it starts feeding on itself.&quot;
<br>
<p>It's a vision of a seamless world of wireless access, where the business
<br>
traveler or cafe habitué can keep in touch via the Web just by walking
<br>
into
<br>
the right spot, turning on the laptop and opening a browser. Other
<br>
services
<br>
are envisioned as well. The technology has been shown to work even if
<br>
the
<br>
laptop is moving, so drive-by access from a car may be possible. Or gas
<br>
stations could have hot spots and offer &quot;info fueling.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;At the same moment you're filling up your gas tank, why wouldn't you
<br>
fill
<br>
up your in-box?&quot; said Mark Goode, chief executive of MobileStar, a
<br>
leader
<br>
in the field.
<br>
<p>But there are a few potential stumbling blocks to such a vision. One is
<br>
the
<br>
prospect of competing standards. Right now, a wireless network protocol
<br>
with the decidedly unsexy name of I.E.E.E. 802.11b appears to be the
<br>
leader, in part because a slower version has been widely used in
<br>
corporations since the early 90's and Apple Computer used it when it
<br>
began
<br>
giving its models wireless capability in mid-1999. (Apple gave it a
<br>
sexier
<br>
name: AirPort.)
<br>
<p>But there are other standards, notably Bluetooth and HomeRF, that could
<br>
catch on as well. The field could become balkanized, creating both
<br>
compatibility and signal interference problems for users.
<br>
<p>Jeff Groudan, the director for Compaq Computers' business portables
<br>
group,
<br>
said that a single user might need two or three wireless standards to
<br>
stay
<br>
connected while traveling from place to place.
<br>
<p>But even if only one standard prevails, competition among providers may
<br>
create headaches for consumers. There are only a few truly national
<br>
providers, with several regional ones that hope to expand, so some
<br>
consolidation or other shaking out of the industry seems inevitable. And
<br>
the user who pays a monthly fee for access through one provider may find
<br>
that the provider's service is available at some airport lounges but not
<br>
at
<br>
others where another company's network is used.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, roaming agreements like those between cell-phone providers
<br>
will
<br>
ease this problem.
<br>
<p>&quot;We've got to create an industry and stop spending money trying to kill
<br>
each other,&quot; said Richard Garnick, chief executive of Global Digital
<br>
Media,
<br>
a service provider focusing on airport terminals, &quot;because we've got to
<br>
save some money to gather customers.&quot;
<br>
<p>One effort to provide wireless access throughout airport terminals
<br>
(rather
<br>
than just in a lounge or two) has already foundered. Softnet, the parent
<br>
company of AerZone, which had contracts to establish access points in
<br>
San
<br>
Francisco and Denver's airports, halted AerZone's operations in
<br>
December,
<br>
citing cost concerns. One estimate put the cost of putting wireless
<br>
access
<br>
throughout a big airport at up to $2 million.
<br>
<p>For now, the leading companies using 802.11b, including MobileStar,
<br>
based
<br>
in Richardson, Tex., and WayPort, of Austin, Tex., are concentrating on
<br>
single-access-point service. Both companies have access points in hotel
<br>
meeting rooms and common areas and in premium membership-based airport
<br>
lounges.
<br>
<p>MobileStar, for example, has about 150 locations, including lounges at
<br>
all
<br>
three New York area airports. But the company has big plans, including
<br>
an
<br>
agreement with Starbucks to create access points in thousands of
<br>
Starbucks
<br>
shops within two years.
<br>
<p>WayPort has made inroads into hotel chains, signing agreements with
<br>
Wyndham
<br>
and Four Seasons hotels, as well as the Meristar Hotels and Resorts
<br>
group,
<br>
which includes some Hilton and Hyatt hotels. In hotels, WayPort runs
<br>
wired
<br>
Ethernet access to each room and provides wireless access in the lobby
<br>
and
<br>
meeting rooms.
<br>
<p>Phil Belanger, vice president for marketing at WayPort, said that his
<br>
company had installations at about 150 hotels and at the Austin,
<br>
Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle-Tacoma airports. The company expects to
<br>
have
<br>
1,200 installations by the end of the year.
<br>
<p>Two other companies, AirWave and Surf and Sip, only operate in
<br>
California,
<br>
mostly at coffee shops and restaurants. Both companies plan to expand
<br>
into
<br>
other states. Surf and Sip turns some of its locations into instant
<br>
Internet cafes by providing a couple of wireless-enabled laptops that
<br>
can
<br>
be rented by the hour and a printer.
<br>
<p>Rick Ehrenspiel, president of Surf and Sip, said that he looked for
<br>
nexus
<br>
points, like the intersection of Vallejo and Polk Streets in San
<br>
Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood. Within a few hundred feet of that
<br>
spot are four coffee shops: Starbucks, Tully's, Peet's and Royal
<br>
Grounds.
<br>
Mr. Ehrenspiel placed his access point in a nearby bar to reach
<br>
customers
<br>
in all four shops.
<br>
<p>That illustrates another aspect of mobile wireless access. Because the
<br>
technology is based on radio transmissions (802.11b equipment operates
<br>
in
<br>
the 2.4-gigahertz range, the same as some cordless phones) it works
<br>
through
<br>
walls. So a Starbucks may be &quot;lit up&quot; by MobileStar, but if a competing
<br>
company has an access point nearby, it may reach customers at the
<br>
Starbucks
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p>At some airports, travelers who for whatever reason cannot get into an
<br>
airline lounge may be able to get wireless access by just lingering
<br>
outside. During an interview with AirWave executives at Paragon, a San
<br>
Francisco restaurant that is part of their network, Avery More, the
<br>
company's chief executive, joined the conversation via instant messaging
<br>
while he was perched near an American Airlines' Admirals Club lounge at
<br>
the
<br>
Dallas-Fort Worth airport.
<br>
<p>And access may not be limited just to the ground. Tenzing
<br>
Communications, a
<br>
firm in competition with Boeing and others to provide in-flight Internet
<br>
access, announced a test of 802.11b networking in conjunction with
<br>
Telia, a
<br>
Swedish telecommunications company, and the SAS airline. The tests are
<br>
intended to certify the protocol as safe for use, according to Tenzing's
<br>
marketing director, Laura Alikpala.
<br>
<p>&quot;As you're waiting for your flight, you can either work in the lounge or
<br>
any of the public places in the airport,&quot; Ms. Alikpala said, &quot;and then
<br>
use
<br>
the same link when you get on the plane to access e-mail or our Web
<br>
cache.&quot;
<br>
<p>The equipment to hook a laptop or handheld organizer into a wireless
<br>
system
<br>
has become inexpensive and ubiquitous in the last year, said Allan
<br>
Scott,
<br>
business developer at Orinoco Systems, a Lucent Technologies division
<br>
that
<br>
manufactures wireless LAN, or local area network, cards. Most laptop
<br>
manufacturers have added or are about to add built-in support for
<br>
wireless
<br>
networking, and some laptops already come equipped with wireless LAN
<br>
cards.
<br>
Cards can also be purchased for $100 to $150. And some hand-held
<br>
organizers
<br>
will soon be able to use the same networks. Xircom is producing a
<br>
Handspring Visor module, which is scheduled to be available this spring.
