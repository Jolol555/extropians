</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitalism has not been successful either.  There are no capitalist

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mixed systems which override the market with government regulation

<em>&gt; and control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither capitalism nor communism appears to be consistent with human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature as it exists today.  Communism fails due to the human tendency to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be lazy and to get as much as possible with as little work as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitalism fails due to the human tendency to be envious and to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intolerant of great differences in wealth and power.  These personality
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; gatherers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So let me ask your rhetorical question back at you.  Why do capitalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and such attempt to treat communists with such disdain &quot;when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have never been able to show even one success after all these years?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just curious.
</em><br>
<p>An excellent analysis, Hal. As to your question, perhaps it's because of the human
<br>
tendency to turn what should be a methodology into an ideology, and then rigidly
<br>
clinging to it. This can lead to the unhealthy practice of condemning anyone who
<br>
thinks differently. Both communists and capitalists have engaged in this pointless
<br>
activity (as well as many other groups).
<br>
<p>Oh, and can we change the name of this thread? I'm beginning to feel
<br>
self-conscious. :-)
