<p>Rating the Current State of Electronic Payment Options
<br>

<a href="http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_article.gsp?c_id=310965">http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_article.gsp?c_id=310965</a>
<br>
<p>My foray into running a web-based business (www.gold-age.net)
<br>
started in November 1999. It has been an incredible series of ups
<br>
and downs; the downs being exacerbated, and sometimes actually
<br>
caused by the payment systems used.  This article presents my
<br>
experiences with various electronic payment systems,
<br>
recommendations as to the best ones currently available, and what
<br>
you should do now, as a business, to avoid getting screwed!
<br>
<p>The Bad
<br>
<p>Credit Cards (Direct Merchant Account):
<br>
<p>&quot;INCREASE SALES 300% OR MORE!  TAKE
<br>
CREDIT CARDS NOW!  AND WATCH YOUR
<br>
BUSINESS SOAR! . . .&quot; -- Or so most
<br>
of the ads read. A more accurate
<br>
headline might read: &quot;Take credit
<br>
cards now and let the headaches
<br>
begin, and your financial doom be
<br>
foretold.&quot; Most people have the
<br>
impression that acceptance of credit
<br>
cards is a must for any successful
<br>
online business.The reality is
<br>
different. Far from being a necessary
<br>
ingredient to success -- taking
<br>
credit cards as a means of payment
<br>
may actually destroy your business.
<br>
<p>To be fair, accepting credit cards as
<br>
a means of payment can be a good
<br>
thing for some businesses. However,
<br>
if your business deals in valuable,
<br>
highly sought after items (like
<br>
electronics, fine jewelry, precious
<br>
metals, or other valuables), you
<br>
better think twice . . . maybe even
<br>
three or four times. Credit card
<br>
fraud is a huge problem, that &quot;The
<br>
Industry&quot; (referring to credit card
<br>
brands, like AMEX, Discover, MC,
<br>
VISA, et al and their supporting
<br>
service providers/gateways) does not
<br>
want to talk about, nor address
<br>
honestly. &quot;The Industry's&quot; lack of
<br>
support, or concern for measures to
<br>
prevent internet related credit card
<br>
fraud is especially troubling since
<br>
practical solutions to the problem
<br>
are rather straight forward and not
<br>
unreasonably difficult to
<br>
implement. Also disconcerting is &quot;The
<br>
Industry's&quot; actual encouragement of
<br>
irresponsible credit card use through
<br>
&quot;Zero Consumer Liability&quot; Policies
<br>
and in some cases &quot;No Contest&quot;
<br>
Chargeback Dispute contracts with
<br>
merchants. The worst, most flagrant,
<br>
and irresponsible example of the &quot;No
<br>
Contest&quot; chargeback policy, for
<br>
merchants, is American Express
<br>
(AMEX). If you are an internet
<br>
merchant taking American Express, and
<br>
a legitimate AMEX customer buys
<br>
something from you using their AMEX
<br>
card, you may never see your money or
<br>
the merchandise again. American
<br>
Express has a &quot;cute&quot; little policy
<br>
(for internet merchants and some
<br>
others) whereby if a customer doesn't
<br>
recall making a charge, they don't
<br>
have to pay; AMEX then takes the
<br>
money from the merchant, even if the
<br>
merchant can PROVE that the goods in
<br>
question WERE actually purchased and
<br>
received by the owner of the credit
<br>
card and that the merchandise is of
<br>
high quality. (Remember, a chargeback
<br>
can slap you in the face months after
<br>
the purchase was made.)
<br>
<p>So what's the biggest problem, that
<br>
has the above mentioned &quot;easy&quot;
<br>
solution?  The most serious, and
<br>
frequent type of online credit card
<br>
fraud involves not the theft and use
<br>
and a physical credit card, but the
<br>
theft and use of valid credit card
<br>
information. This can be done in a
<br>
number of ways, not the least of
<br>
which involves digging through
<br>
someone's garbage or the more
<br>
frequent electronic theft of
<br>
information (suggestions for personal
<br>
protection from this type of crime
<br>
are beyond the scope of this article
<br>
-- but may be written up at a later
<br>
time) ranging from fraudulent order
<br>
forms on the web to infiltration of
<br>
personal and commercial
<br>
computers. Depending on the skill of
<br>
the perpetrator (they get better all
<br>
the time), bad orders generated from
<br>
stolen information are often not
<br>
detectable as such -- only later
<br>
(sometimes much later) does a
<br>
merchant realize they've been burned
<br>
when money is pulled from their
<br>
account due to a chargeback.
