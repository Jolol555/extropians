<p>Normally, telling someone that you're recording the conversation is 
<br>
sufficient to be able to do so, right?  If you tell the cop you're 
<br>
recording him, though, he might get abusive and take your tape. 
<br>
Solution?  Keep two tape recorders handy - one in sight, and one 
<br>
hidden.  If he forces you to give him the tape from the first, you've 
<br>
*really* have him busted on the second.
<br>
<p>Oh, just a thought.
