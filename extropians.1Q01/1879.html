is

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is perhaps true in the US. Here in New Zealand (and probably in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia too, which is where Emlyn appears to be from, judging from her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email address)
</em><br>
<p>Quick note: I'm a guy. Emlyn really is a guy's name; really!
<br>
<p>Also, yup I'm from Australia, and you are right about the bias toward MS
<br>
here. However, I've been a pure teleworker for a while now, I'm working for
<br>
a US company based in the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; MS has an inordinately large share of the market.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is partly due to the fact that NZ and AUS companies are much smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than US companies and consequently don't need the scalability offered by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oracle, Sun etc.  Piracy is perhaps also more prevalent here (though I
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; no figures on this).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've typically found strong management resistance to non-MS solutions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though this is reducing - after all, what management team can argue with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freely available open-source office suites, web-servers, and databases!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Geez, the purists really did jump down my throat on this whole issue. I'm
<br>
beginning to be concerned that I'm crossing into troll territory on the
<br>
language/system choice issue.
<br>
<p>What can I say? I love GUIs, I don't love command lines. I've been a unix
<br>
admin, and a unix developer, and my rather drawn out degree involved all
<br>
coding on unix boxes. I've never really grown to like it. Perhaps it's
<br>
because my earliest influence in IT was my dad, who hated unix with a
<br>
passion (a vms man). There used to be a time when unix was seen as a cobbled
<br>
together joke of an operating system, compared to the state of the art.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I've been working with MS stuff for years now. I love it.
<br>
I love the win32 world. It's pretty. Some of the variants are even halfway
<br>
decent operating systems. The tools are wonderful. The finished products are
<br>
beautiful.
<br>
<p>Other than my pro MS bias, and a deep affection for Borland's Delphi, I
<br>
don't have any particular alliegance to products/languages/etc. Whatever is
<br>
necessary to get the job done. It's the thing you are trying to achieve, not
<br>
the tools you use to achieve it with.
<br>
<p>A final bit of ranting... while lots of people have said that ASP/IIS/ETC is
<br>
a bad way to go (and even bad from a saleable job skills sense, weird),
<br>
everyone's been putting forward a different point of view. I would put it to
<br>
you all that none of us has the big picture. The IT world is truly immense
<br>
these days; is it just possible that each of us is dwelling in his/her own
<br>
private little (very large) world, and not considering views/truths from
<br>
outside that domain?
