<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ...we can discuss those difficult and emotional issues such as

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; pun control.  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Honestly!  I am really sorry about this sheep fiasco.  I cud not resist!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do allow me to redeem myself with an idea I had while hiking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today, alongside hilly pastures where flocks graze.  I recalled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearing of western farmers having bad times because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losses in their flocks and herds from predatory wolves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coyotes.  The young calves sometimes get separated from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their mothers and stand forlornly on the periphery of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herd, bleating and mooing.  The wolves hear this cry of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distress and close in, and soon are devouring the helpless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beast as the greiving mother bawls helplessly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nowthen, seems to me like we could develop a robolamb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or robocalf which would look just like the carbon based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety, and act like it too: it would wander alongside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herd, bawling like an orphan.  But with an important difference:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the robolamb would have built-in image recognition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be able to figure out when the wolf pack was closing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in!  The robolamb would bleat helplessly until the big bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wolf came in for the kill, at which time it would turn to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face the approaching attacker and give the stalking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carnovore a snoot full of double ought buck.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The farmers would love such a device!  Especially if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image recognition software in the robolamb became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated enough to distinguish between wolves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We could think up cutesy brand names for our deadly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little mechanical sheep, such as... BLamb.  Or how about:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do Ewe Feel Lucky?  Personally, I like:  Heeeeere Wolfy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wolfy Wolfyyyy...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soon a subspecies of wolf would evolve which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has no appetite whatsoever for sheep or calves.  A good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GPS aboard the robolamb prevents the well-armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beast from wandering off into town, giving and entirely new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning to that verse in Revelation 6 regarding people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fleeing the wrath of the lamb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, dammit I havent been smoking anything!  spike
</em><br>
<p>Expen$ive for a small market- but game wardens in India have put up
<br>
dummies (dressed in peasant garb) in areas where tigers have attacked
<br>
humans.  The dummy is wired with 220 VAC, and kitty gets one helluva zot
<br>
when he tries to eat the slow monkey.  Behavior mod at it finest.
<br>
<p>Also, since tigers like to attack from behind, country folk living
<br>
around the nature preserve are issued masks to wear on the backs of
<br>
their heads.  The only people attacked recently have been ones who took
<br>
their masks off.
<br>
<p>I can't make up anything this silly.
