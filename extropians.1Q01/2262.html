<p>OK, so you are talking about ideals over pragmatism/reality. Fair enough.
<br>
<p>I don't think you'd ever see this, though. Business is not the olympics,
<br>
fair play, it's not how you win, it's how you play the game, all that good
<br>
stuff. Hell, the olympics is hardly the olympics by those standards. Nothing
<br>
is.
<br>
<p>Business is a lot more like natural selection. It's not an environment where
<br>
fair play is going to help you stay alive. It's dirty, and desperate. Even
<br>
those big monopolies, who crush all in their path, are one step, one
<br>
environmental shift, one mis-direction, from becoming corporate worm food.
<br>
<p>Particularly, pure competition never, ever makes good sense. If you have to
<br>
flog a product in an environment of multiple competitors, each striving
<br>
solely on his/her merits, and the winner takes all (pretty much par for the
<br>
course), what chance is it that the winner will be you? Less than 50%? Say
<br>
the money invested is your own. Does that make any sense at all, as a
<br>
business model?
<br>
<p>Different sized companies cope in different ways. Small companies stay small
<br>
and nimble, and they find obscure niches which are not desired or occupiable
<br>
by the larger players. Medium sized companies... dunno what they do.
<br>
Struggle, I think Eat the littluns, and try to avoid the bigguns. Sometimes
<br>
they band together, for strength in numbers (eg: they push Standards). Large
<br>
companies stomp around breaking things that look dangerous, roaring at each
<br>
other from the hilltops like mighty dinosaurs.
<br>
<p>But no one gets into the fighting pit and dukes it out, in a good clean
<br>
fight, may the best man win, tally ho, what! What a damned mad idea. Well,
<br>
actually some try to, by building a better product and relying on it's
<br>
merits. Some of the best ideas have died that way.
