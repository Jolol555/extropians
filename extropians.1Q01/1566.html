in
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt;self-organization.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe you've changed the definition mid-course.
</em><br>
<p>I'm using it only in the sense which I learned to use it over the past
<br>
decade or so.  This is the way it is used in most technical or philosophical
<br>
treatments of evolutionary theory.
<br>
<p>Also, the Latin-derived term used for &quot;directed evolution&quot; is
<br>
&quot;orthogenesis.&quot;  My dictionary -- _Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
<br>
Dictionary_ (1991) -- defines the latter as &quot;variation of organisms in
<br>
successive generations that in some evolutionary theories takes place in
<br>
some predestined direction and results in progressive evolutionary trends
<br>
independent of external factors.&quot;  No mention of God, theology, or
<br>
creationism there.  (Not surprising, since the term was coined in the late
<br>
19th century.)
<br>
<p>I only clarified my defintion -- the one most evolutionary biologists and
<br>
philosophers of biology use -- when I noticed that Samantha and others were
<br>
using it to mean roughly &quot;directed by some mind including a divine one.&quot;
<br>
Granted, it's no big leap to go from &quot;directed evolution&quot; to &quot;directed by
<br>
God.&quot;  The words are just too close.  However, in evolutionary circles --
<br>
not the creationist debating circles, which are pop science at best -- the
<br>
term is used differently than what you'd expect.
<br>
<p>Of course, in my context, I'd never really considered &quot;directed evolution&quot;
<br>
to mean &quot;directed by a mind.&quot;:)  It always seemed to me to be a plausible
<br>
alternative to either genetic drift (neutral evolution) or environmental
<br>
selection (natural selection, which in itself is confusing since neither
<br>
directed evolution nor genetic drift posit unnatural causes of evolution:).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The more usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connotation of directed evolution, sans theology, might be closer to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program under investigation by the Arnold group, led by Frances H. Arnold,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Professor of Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry, Division of Chemistry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Chemical Engineering, Caltech. E.g.:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.cheme.caltech.edu/groups/fha/Enzyme/directed.html">http://www.cheme.caltech.edu/groups/fha/Enzyme/directed.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>I see.  Well, he defines his usage from the start.  It's only words.  I'm
<br>
using the words in a different way.  I think my pointing out that directed
<br>
evolution -- perhaps we can use &quot;orthogenesis&quot; to avoid confusion -- was
<br>
valid here, especially since most here tend to collapse valid evolutionary
<br>
theory into environmental selection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Of course, it seems to have gone the way of most threads here.  People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;telling jokes.  People attacking each other's character and intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's because the use of the term in the main stem of the thread was (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed) crypto-theological. What other response than parody and mockery do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you expect on this list?
</em><br>
<p>I believe you are being too charitable here.  Start a thread on any topic
<br>
here and see where it winds up.  The end state -- the equilibrium of the
<br>
list -- seems to be parody, mockery, and personal attack.  Granted, this is
<br>
NOT peculiar to this list.  I've seen it happen on other unmoderated lists.
<br>
(That said, Extropy list is still valuable -- to me.  I wouldn't have stayed
<br>
on it all these years if not.:)
