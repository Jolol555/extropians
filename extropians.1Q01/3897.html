For some odd reason, I was thinking about the Arizona State Fair yesterday.
<br>
My family and I really like going to the fair - it's a great place to people
<br>
watch and I especially enjoy the myriad booths hawking everything from
<br>
Your-Name-On-A-Grain-Of-Rice to Eternal-Salvation(Haleluljah!) to political
<br>
booths of every flavor.  I began wondering, &quot;Wouldn't it be cool if we had
<br>
an Extropy booth at the state fair?&quot;  Then I began trying to imagine what
<br>
such a thing might would contain...  Perhaps it could be a take off on one
<br>
of the Haleluljah booths - we could give away little cards with the
<br>
Extropian Principles and maybe sell Darwin fishes.  I dunno... I kind of
<br>
drew a blank...  I think it's a good idea, but what *would* an Extropy booth
<br>
look like?
<br>
<p>Anyone interested in doing such a thing?  I'd be willing to volunteer time
<br>
if we had a great idea/theme/whatever...
