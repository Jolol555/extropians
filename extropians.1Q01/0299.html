<em>&gt; Another good example of translated poetry is in the work of Stanislaw Lem, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translated from Polish to English.  The Cyberiad has two robots engaging in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a poetry duel.  One is challenged to write &quot;a poem about a haircut! But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lofty, nobel, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heroism in the face of certain doom! Six lines, cleverly rhymed, and every 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word beginning with the letter &quot;s&quot;!&quot;  Of course he succeeds and it's quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good poem, but when you've read it and thought about it, you end up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wondering about the translation and the original text.  The Translator may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have had good material to work with but he still did a brilliant job of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicating the sense of it.
</em><br>
<p>I've often wondered about this as well.  The poem is nicely done and widely
<br>
quoted on the net:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seduced, shaggy Samson snored.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She scissored short. Sorely shorn,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon shackled slave, Samson sighed,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently scheming,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sightlessly seeking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some savage, spectacular suicide. 
<br>
<p>Surely the translator deserves at least as much credit as Lem for
<br>
producing this poem (assuming he was the one who created it), but I
<br>
never see him credited.
<br>
<p>The Lem story is very funny, as Trurl shows off his poetry machine to
<br>
his rival, Klapaucius.  At first the machine does poorly, and Klapaucius
<br>
gloats (see <a href="http://catalog.com/hopkins/lem/HorriblePoems.html">http://catalog.com/hopkins/lem/HorriblePoems.html</a>).  But then
<br>
the machine gets working and Klapaucius becomes enraged with jealousy,
<br>
as it passes each of the progressively more difficult challenges he offers
<br>
(<a href="http://catalog.com/hopkins/lem/WonderfulPoems.html">http://catalog.com/hopkins/lem/WonderfulPoems.html</a>).
