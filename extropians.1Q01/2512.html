<p><em>&gt;James, as a professional, what is your assessment of recently released

</em><br>
<p><p>MySQL isn't in the same class largely because it was originally designed 
<br>
with very different goals, and the current code base reflects this.  MySQL 
<br>
was designed to be lightweight, fast, and simple.  It was not designed to 
<br>
be a large-scale robust database, and this is reflected in the internals.
<br>
<p>The biggest problem is that MySQL lacks a proper kernel, though I won't go 
<br>
into details regarding specific deficiencies.  As Monty will tell you, 
<br>
there is no one on the team really qualified to develop a proper database 
<br>
kernel.  Therefore, the existing kernel is amateurish in a large number of 
<br>
respects and takes some rather naive approaches to scalable and robust 
<br>
design, or in many cases, it doesn't even attempt to be scalable.  The 
<br>
result is a chimera that has been jury-rigged together and extended in ways 
<br>
that no one foresaw, and shows a lack of foresight in general.  Some of the 
<br>
hacks, though correct in the context of the source tree, are so inelegant 
<br>
that it should be criminal.  They've been clumsily gluing in third-party 
<br>
code to try and extend the capabilities of the engine (e.g. the SleepyCat 
<br>
code), but this has limits.  This is my primary reason for having a rather 
<br>
negative outlook on it.
<br>
<p>However, this could be solved by having a few qualified software engineers 
<br>
design and build a scalable and complete database kernel from the ground up 
<br>
and then porting the SQL layer to it.  A well-implemented and full-featured 
<br>
C language kernel that is enterprise-ready typically weighs in at 20-30k 
<br>
LoC (I've seen super-clean and elegant ones as small as 15 kLoC) and could 
<br>
easily be done by a few competent software engineers with experience in 
<br>
this domain within 6 months, though it would take a little time for the top 
<br>
layers to catch up with the bottom layers.
<br>
<p>My two cents...
<br>
