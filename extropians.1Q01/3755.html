<em>&gt; According to today's The New York Times, next week the Journals &quot;Science&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;Nature&quot; will independently publish two long articles reporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the latest results from the analysis of the human genome. The rival
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teams from Celera and The National Institute Of Health come to similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions. One surprise is that humans only have about 30,000 genes,
</em><br>
<p>The L.A. Times mentioned that the roundworm, one of the few other animals
<br>
which has been completely sequenced, has 20000 genes to control only
<br>
959 cells.  That's right, the adult roundworm has exactly 959 cells and
<br>
almost as many genes as a human being.
<br>
<p>Wired magazine has an article about a rival scientist who claims that the
<br>
groups have missed the majority of human genes.  From
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,41718,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,41718,00.html</a>:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a small number would be almost embarrassing. The pufferfish has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about 50,000 genes, for Pete's sake. But Haseltine said not to worry.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have isolated genes using other methods and know there are at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least 90,000 and probably 120,000. But (their number) is not surprising
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considering the data they worked from,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>I suspect he was mostly taking advantage of the opportunity to embarrass
<br>
his rival due to the unexpected and somewhat awkward result.  But you
<br>
can't help wondering whether the small number points to something we're
<br>
missing.
