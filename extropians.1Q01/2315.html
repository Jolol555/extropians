<em>&gt; Has anyone noticed the similarity to vegetarianism in all this?
</em><br>
<p>Rabid advocacy battles is a fundamental human thing, so the similiarity
<br>
to XY is unsurprising.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ms-flunkies (including me, apparently) are the meat eaters, junk food

<br>
I dropped about 5 kg when I quit my SoCal junk food habit, turning a few
<br>
more into muscle mass. I doubt I can ever stomach true CR, but I'm
<br>
certainly limiting my caloric intake (CR is but an end point of a continuum), 
<br>
and I'm moving away from mass-produced animal protein. Sea fish is a bit high
<br>
on PCBs, but heck, one has to eat something.&lt;/unrelated&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As to dining on scraps from Redmond's table, that's a classical scavenger
<br>
behaviour. Ulch, that meat was tainted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The anti-ms camp are the vegetarians; and I've noticed from this very fun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rumble that, just like vegetarians, there is no unity in that camp.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there is: OpenSource. If I'm against MS, it doesn't mean I'm pro
<br>
Sun or pro Oracle or pro IBM.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We've got people who'll dabble in MS products, but prefer the good stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they can get it (I'm a vegetarian, because I only eat fish).
</em><br>
<p>I will use MS products if I don't have a choice. I will not do it gladly,
<br>
and I will make every effort to make this condition temporary.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There are those who use anything as long as it's on Unix, and that's that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (straight out vegos).
</em><br>
<p>Naw, *nix is far from being perfect, but it has a tolerable payoff of
<br>
a user/support base and availability of usable software. It would have
<br>
been fun, if the Forth and/or Lisp community went supercritical, including
<br>
hardware. We do have a small revival of end user hardware design with
<br>
FPGAs, but we'll only see lots of interesting stuff if a prototyping
<br>
system will drop down to a few megabucks, and a prototyping run wouldn't
<br>
cost more than a few hundred bucks. Hence the printable circuit scene needs
<br>
close watching, despite its obvious limitations.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And the most rabid camp, who wont learn proprietary languages, wont have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ought to do with proprietary products, apparently, which rules out all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; windows, much of unix, and most of anything else. Rabid open-source fanatics
</em><br>
<p>As you well know, the future of proprietary Unices does not look very bright.
<br>
I see vendors slowly ceasing to support their proprietary derivates as Linux
<br>
matures (code fork between high end low end seems imminent or a fait accompli
<br>
already). If you're reading news, the trend is obvious for 1-2 years now.
<br>
It is interesting to see at which stage Intel will dare openly ignore Microsoft.
<br>
<p>By the volume (and some would argue, also by quality), Linux is the Microsoft 
<br>
of OpenSource OSses. Of course, there are variations: there's Debian, and the
<br>
rest of them. I haven't personally used *BSD, but serious people seem to like
<br>
it. The architecture and the code quality seems to be much cleaner, albeit
<br>
we're not nearly at the level of true microkernels like QNX and Fiasco.
<br>
<p>There have been rather interesting proprietary developments in the past, but 
<br>
the reason they're there (in the dustbin of history or in an embedded niche) 
<br>
is that they never went OpenSource or never even had the guts of giving binaries
<br>
away for free in the time when that would have made a difference. Taos, Be and 
<br>
QNX would seem to be the most obvious examples.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; amongst them (You guessed it; the vegans).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I bet there are more categories; anyone?
</em><br>
<p>Computer cowboys: people who design and make their own silicon, and use only
<br>
roll-your-own software, of course. Some of them are lunatic fringe, some are
<br>
rather impressive.
