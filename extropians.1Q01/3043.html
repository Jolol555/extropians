<em>&gt; &gt; No matter how you slice it, law enforcement is intrusive.  It's hard
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because it's more thorough at its job.  They're not breaking into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyones' houses.  They're not tapping anyones' phone conversations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They're not racially profiling and detaining people.  So what's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem besides the fact that they're now better at their jobs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Personally, I think that there's too much real crime in our society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so solutions like this that don't violate anyones' rights don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bother me.
</em><br>
