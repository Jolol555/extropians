i think that you have a point, that trans/post/neo/X whatever *human is 
<br>
really just a case of definition.
<br>
<p>you call yourself posthuman. it seems to be just a less rigorous requirement 
<br>
than i expect, because i'm using the scale of extropian trans to post(which 
<br>
is supposed to occur when we all get natasha's new set of wheels)(and/or 
<br>
stop with the exclusive humanoidism altogether.
<br>
but again, it's your definition, not mine.
<br>
<p><p>however, i'm a little confused. you invoke MVT a lot. But i don't really 
<br>
understand how this is a powerful philosophy, or exactly how it does the 
<br>
things you claim it can.
<br>
<p>as i understand it MVT is just a theory that states that information is 
<br>
fundamentally different than physical structure. so in order to interact 
<br>
with informative states, you need a non-physical structure, which is the 
<br>
neuroanatomical &quot;hole&quot; around where the median eye(or whatever you want to 
<br>
call it) used to be, before we stopped needing it to do what it does in 
<br>
lower animals.
<br>
<p>okay.
<br>
<p>based on this, cetecarians(sp?) like dophins and such are concious, or at 
<br>
least capable of being so. as well as a few other animals.
<br>
<p>now where i get confused is when you say that MVT could produce mind-control 
<br>
theorems, better hypnosis, that understanding it makes your psychology 
<br>
different than mine.
<br>
<p>what insights does MVT give you on human psycho-anatomy that is not just 
<br>
syncretistic of other discoveries. and if you reallly have a lock on this, 
<br>
why aren't you out there selling the results of this theorem, rather than 
<br>
just the theory itself?
<br>
<p>if you've really got something, people respond better when you show some 
<br>
results, and they ask how you got them, rather than just telling them the 
<br>
basis for something they've never seen before. (hm, bad sentence structure, 
<br>
but i hope you get the gist)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course, I understand MVT! My psychology is pretty unique.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But we are still &quot;remotely&quot; ape-like in appearance, and I must appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remotely human and use your crummy languages in order to communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with you .....
</em><br>
<p>where is the functional difference that occurs when you &quot;understand&quot; or use 
<br>
MVT? what kind of advantages do you have over us non-adepti?
<br>
<p>&lt;snip long reply to max more's post&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;MVT has been debated in depth on this list. The facts and claims have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;always been open to scrutiny and refutation.
</em><br>
<p>out of curiosity, when was it debated, and who was involved? i imagine 
<br>
eliezer would take umbrage at the idea that information processing on the 
<br>
order of conciousness requires imaginary objects, and a lot of people here 
<br>
seem to subscribe to the church-turing idea that all mindstuff can be 
<br>
computationally modeled.
<br>
<p>anyway, when it was debated, how did it turn out? MVT seems a little 
<br>
philosophic for JR, and other people who like their houses nice and tidy.  
<br>
and certainly seems to violate occams razor to me, but then, i don't really 
<br>
know much past what i read on your website.
