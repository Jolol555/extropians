<p>
The deep linking issue has some wrinkles:
<br>
<p>1. &quot;Links&quot; may be presented in many contexts which radically alter the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way they would be perceived.  Links can be arranged in frames (even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in cases where the frame borders are deliberately made obscure)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such that the linked-to content *appears to be original to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linking site*, unless the browser user inspects the URL through use
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of browser utilities.  Therefore, the linked to content effectively
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very closely resembles a copy, rather than a link.
<br>
<p>2. Deep linking may be done in such a way as to strip off any framing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;components that the original content author considers essential to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the presentation of the content, whether for economic reasons or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the author hoped to present the content in a particular
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gestalt.
<br>
<p>In concert, these two factors might work out like this:
<br>
<p>I publish a webzine, and I have various navigational tools in a frame
<br>
on the left, and various ads in a frame across the top.  The
<br>
lower-right area shows articles, which I have paid authors to write.
<br>
Moreover, I break these articles up into pages, the first of which is
<br>
a title page with some copyright information.  
<br>
<p>Imagine that somebody else links to my articles (starting always on
<br>
the second page, thereby directing users to skip over the copyright
<br>
data) in a frame on her site.  This person does not make it clear in
<br>
the text what the source of the articles is.  Imagine that in my
<br>
weblogs I begin to notice many more people are reading the articles,
<br>
starting on the second page, from a &quot;REFERER-URL&quot; indicative of the
<br>
other user's site.  When I browse that site I discover that casual
<br>
users there:
<br>
<p>a. would have no idea the content came from my site
<br>
b. would never see my advertisers' ads
<br>
c. would never see by-lines and copyright info I expect to accompany
<br>
the article.
<br>
<p>This gives the issue a different complexion, now doesn't it?  Deep
<br>
linking, especially when framed, can thus be used to accomplish
<br>
something very similar to an unauthorized copy of selected portions of
<br>
my site, under the guise of &quot;just making a link&quot;, not a copy.  I
<br>
believe these issues have not yet been tried out in court, but IANAL,
<br>
and I haven't researched it.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
James Wetterau
