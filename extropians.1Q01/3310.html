<p>If true, this is indicative of something. Appalling laziness and
<br>
presumption, perhaps--of the general UK populace? I know &quot;bloody&quot;
<br>
stopped being offensive around the 1960s, at least among the generation
<br>
that watched / created (e.g.) &quot;Monty Python&quot;.
<br>
<p>Still and all, I also happen to find fault with people who can't be
<br>
bothered to use a search engine when I've provided sufficient search
<br>
terms. Generally, when asked for a cite, I'll spoon feed the person the
<br>
search engine and terms, to rub their noses in it.
<br>
<p>Sorry to be such a nuisance, but at least I never called you a twat. 
<br>
<p>Wanker.
<br>
<p>PS: Permit me to make clear that in the US, &quot;wanker&quot; is regarded as
<br>
merely a funny Briticism; since I know it means &quot;masturbator&quot;, I'd still
<br>
say that your engagement in this protracted discussion appears to
<br>
qualify you for the title.
