<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Welcome to the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the difference between this system and being in a small town,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; are? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the difference between this system and having a large team of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; felons and wanted criminals, watching near the gate? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No matter how you slice it, law enforcement is intrusive.  It's hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make a case against the use of technology in law enforcement just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it's more thorough at its job.  They're not breaking into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyones' houses.  They're not tapping anyones' phone conversations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They're not racially profiling and detaining people.  So what's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem besides the fact that they're now better at their jobs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I think that there's too much real crime in our society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so solutions like this that don't violate anyones' rights don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother me.
</em><br>
<p>If this system is only used to find and catch wanted serious criminals,
<br>
that is one thing. If it's used to keep tabs on the whereabouts of
<br>
politically active people who oppose the government in power, or else
<br>
things so minor as apprehending people like you and me when we forget to
<br>
pay a parking ticket, and trussing us up like enemy number one in front
<br>
of people we know, then such technology is most certainly violating
<br>
people's rights.
