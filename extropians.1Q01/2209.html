<p>
<em>&gt;I learned of this study from my local newspaper.
</em><br>
<p>This same article appeared in my local newspaper.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The article pointed out that with all the &quot;super megadosage&quot; vitamin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pills selling so well it's important to know not just about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recommended dose, but how much can cause a harmful overdose.
</em><br>
<p>True.  This was the exact situation that lead me to compile my 
<br>
_Nutrients_Catalog_ 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://harveynewstrom.com/nutrition/nutrientscatalog/index.html">http://harveynewstrom.com/nutrition/nutrientscatalog/index.html</a>&gt;.  I 
<br>
turned vegetarian, but could not find good sources of toxic symptoms. 
<br>
Most books gave symptoms that suggested taking more, but almost none 
<br>
gave symptoms that would suggest taking less.  I did my own research 
<br>
at a biochemistry library and quickly discovered that popular books 
<br>
are mostly wrong and are decades behind recent research.  Eventually 
<br>
my research database became so large that I decided to publish it as 
<br>
a reference volume through McFarland &amp; Company.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Vitamin A  -a dose of 3,000 micrograms can risk birth defects in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unborn and cause liver damage for people.
</em><br>
<p>The article confused the beta-carotene form of vitamin A (found in 
<br>
carrots) with the retinol form of vitamin A (found in liver).  The 
<br>
article references carrots as a source of vitamin A, which would be 
<br>
the beta-carotene form, but then calculates the dangerous dosage and 
<br>
gives the toxicity symptoms of the retinol form.
<br>
<p>Micrograms are useless to measure vitamin A because different forms 
<br>
have different potency.  3000 micrograms of beta-carotene (found in 
<br>
carrots) would be 2500iu which is only half of the RDA.  3000 
<br>
micrograms of retinol (found in liver) would be 15000iu which is 
<br>
three times the RDA.
<br>
<p>The toxicity symptoms given above only occur with high dosages of the 
<br>
retinol form, but is not a danger with the beta-carotene form. 
<br>
Linking this dosage and these symptoms with vitamin A from carrots is 
<br>
just wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Vitamin E -more then 1,000 milligrams can risk uncontrolled bleeding.
</em><br>
<p>Milligrams of vitamin E is also a useless measurement.  Different 
<br>
forms of vitamin E have different potencies.  Measuring 1000 
<br>
milligrams of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, and other tocopherols 
<br>
will yield different dosages.  The article is obviously referencing 
<br>
the most common form of vitamin E, dl-alpha-tocopherol, and is 
<br>
calculating a commonly cited limit of 3000iu.
<br>
<p>The uncontrolled bleeding is due to the blood thinning effect of 
<br>
vitamin E.  People taking vitamin E to reduce their risk of heart 
<br>
attacks may bleed more easily, as do people taking aspirin every day. 
<br>
Most people taking these high doses consider this to be a health 
<br>
enhancing property rather than a detracting one.  One must have 
<br>
specific health goals in mind before deciding what effects are good 
<br>
or bad, or how much is appropriate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Folic acid -more then 1 milligram a day can result in nerve damage.
</em><br>
<p>This seems low, but close enough.  They either have more recent 
<br>
information or are adding a safety margin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The institute warns that consumers are sometimes confused by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vitamins sold in &quot;international units&quot; because they do not know how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to convert them into micrograms and milligrams which can differ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;based on the nutrient.  So be careful...
</em><br>
<p>This is bizarre.  Nobody should be converting milligrams to 
<br>
international units (iu) unless you are weighing or measuring your 
<br>
own.  All nutrients sold in pill form are dosed in iu.  All 
<br>
scientific information about nutrients in measured in iu.  Once you 
<br>
determine how many iu is desired, the pills are labeled the same way. 
<br>
This implies that milligrams are normal measurements and that iu are 
<br>
confusing.  Actually, it is the other way around.  Wieghts in 
<br>
milligrams are only useful if you have a pharmaceutical scale and are 
<br>
mixing/packing your own capsules.
