<p>Only in the sense of 'ours is the most terrible system, except for all the
<br>
others'. It goes to the voluntary participatory system we have versus the
<br>
totalitarian system needed to maintain a fully socialist economy beyond a
<br>
socialist/market hybrid that would be typical of a limited democracy
<br>
mercantilist system. As Kant illustrated, democracies of all types tend to be
<br>
benign generally, especially in relation to other democratic systems, as most
<br>
people generally prefer to live peacefully, so when popular opinion helps
<br>
determine public policy more, peace tends to result. Kant also said that those
<br>
who would be tyrants, of petty or tremendous scope (from obnoxious muslim or
<br>
christian fundamentalists or neighborhood left-wingers to tyrants like Stalin,
<br>
Mao, or Reno), cannot be dealt with by democracies as those democracies deal
<br>
with each other, because would be tyrants base their actions on force,
<br>
agression, and individual self interest rather than mutual self-interest
<br>
determined by market polities. Demagogues do try to convert open democracies
<br>
into tyrannies by destroying the mutual trust that builds in democracies, which
<br>
is why so much of the socialist trends of the last century in formerly open
<br>
democracies have been built on extended campaigns of rhetoric and propaganda by
<br>
demagogues seeking to convince people to surrender their liberties freely.

<em>&gt; &gt; Those of us who lived when the USSR was a powerful force in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the world lived with the notion (which I still believe) that communism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot prosper long term alongside capitalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are two problems with this.  First, USSR stands for the Union
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Soviet Socialist Republics.  Notice that there is no &quot;communism&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the name.  Technically the USSR was socialist, not communist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, as conservatives love to point out, much of the early Socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Party platform has been enacted in the United States, and similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provisions exist in most so-called &quot;capitalist&quot; countries.  See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.conservativebeacon.com/essays/Socialism/socialist_platform.html">http://www.conservativebeacon.com/essays/Socialism/socialist_platform.html</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This means that, in a sense, the United States is as much socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as capitalist.  The long conflict between the USSR and the US was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ideological battle between capitalism and communism.  It was a power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggle between two socialist nations.
</em><br>
<p>No, it was a battle between the two systems, and the extent to which our system
<br>
became more socialist is an indication of the memetic damage that was done in
<br>
the last 70 years the conflict has raged. The US was not originally socialist
<br>
in any way shape or form.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We should not be blinded by patriotic or ideological propaganda.  We live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a mixed society, part capitalist and part socialist.
</em><br>
<p>Now, we do. We did not live so originally. Planks of the socialist agenda have
<br>
been on the Democratic party platform for the last 50 years, and as a former
<br>
head of the US Socialist Party has said, Americans accepted socialism only
<br>
under the guise of modern liberalism. Thankfully, as more of the socialist
<br>
infrastructure is dismantled, our economy has accelerated nicely.
