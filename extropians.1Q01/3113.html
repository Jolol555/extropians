<p>Sure, but, the best days of highschool or college work were precisely
<br>
when
<br>
such experts and simply people who loved a particular subject came in. 
<br>
Sometimes they were also great teachers, sometimes they weren't, but it
<br>
almost invariably was a welcome break and taught me a lot I wouldn't
<br>
otherwise get.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Being good at a particular topic and being a good teach are two
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject they are trying to teach.  Other people are experts in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject, but don't know how to convey the knowledge effectively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some people are good at both.  Some people are lousy at both.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah.  Unfortunately many of the last are the &quot;official&quot; teachers.
