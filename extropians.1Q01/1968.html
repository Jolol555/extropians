George Will
<br>
January 21, 2001
<br>
<p>Cloning could wipe out mankind
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON--There are some things humanity cannot get used to without
<br>
jeopardizing its humanness--without becoming beastly. Creeping toward us, as
<br>
on little cat feet--little monkey feet, actually--is perhaps the gravest
<br>
imaginable crisis, one that could result in the end of history as a
<br>
distinctively human, and humane, story. Recently a rhesus monkey named ANDi
<br>
(``inserted DNA,'' backwards) became the first genetically altered primate
<br>
ever created. Created, not begotten; the result of manufacture, not
<br>
procreation. There is a world of difference. Humans are primates. We are
<br>
next. Or at any rate, we are in line for genetic ``enhancement.''
<br>
<p>Not until ANDi reaches sexual maturity will scientists know if the jellyfish
<br>
gene inserted into his genetic makeup--a gene which seems to be in all his
<br>
tissues--is in his reproductive cells and will be passed along, making
<br>
possible a man-made line of primates. But such an outcome is just a matter
<br>
of time. So, probably, is the maximum genetic transfer--human cloning.
<br>
<p>Let us stipulate that genetic manipulations can yield therapeutic blessings.
<br>
Genetically altered animals can illuminate causes and possible cures or
<br>
ameliorations of many diseases. Genetic manipulations in humans can be
<br>
therapeutic for diseases, even injuries (e.g., to spinal cords), and will
<br>
make possible research clarifying the roles of nature and nurture in shaping
<br>
human beings.
<br>
<p>Enhancement is not therapy, it is eugenics. Genetic selection--the negative
<br>
eugenics of preventing certain traits in children--is already common,
<br>
through genetic screening and amniocentesis. However, at least negative
<br>
eugenics is supposed to serve an existing norm of health. But positive
<br>
eugenics, any tailoring of an individual's genetic endowment, even when less
<br>
ambitious than cloning, will put us on a slippery slope to the abolition of
<br>
man. Leon Kass, a biologist and ethicist with the University of Chicago,
<br>
explains why in his essay ``The Wisdom of Repugnance.''
<br>
<p>Genetic manipulation extends the belief that all children should be
<br>
wanted--a principle justifying abortion--to embrace the belief that
<br>
children, to be acceptable, should, in their genetic traits, satisfy our
<br>
wants for their identities. Eugenics exemplifies the modern project--to
<br>
control the future, including the imposition of our design on our children,
<br>
while our autonomy remains uncontrolled. A casualty of this project is, Kass
<br>
says, the awe and respect for life arising from ``the unique,
<br>
never-to-be-repeated character of each human life.''
<br>
<p>When parents stop saying (in Kass' words) ``yes to the emergence of new life
<br>
in its novelty,'' when they stop saying yes to whatever the child turns out
<br>
to be, then the meaning of having a child, and the parent-child relation,
<br>
will be profoundly altered, with consequences that are unforeseeable but
<br>
cannot be benign. When parents can preselect their child's genetic
<br>
constitution, procreation will become manufacture, children will become
<br>
artifacts, identity and individuality will become confused, and parents will
<br>
become despots.
<br>
<p>Hubris and narcissism will color even the well-intentioned transformation of
<br>
a child--for its ``own good''--from an unscripted surprise into someone's
<br>
artifice or project. And there is a fundamental threat to humanity in the
<br>
reduction of another being to an extension of a person's will. There must be
<br>
a despotism of the enhancer over the enhanced, a despotism that would not be
<br>
justified even if the enhancement really were an improvement. It would
<br>
condemn a child to never achieving true independence from its parents.
<br>
<p>It is, Kass says, ``moral myopia'' to think that all values must yield to
<br>
the goals of better health and desirable traits. A cost of such yielding can
<br>
be the reduction of man to the status of just another man-made thing.
<br>
<p>But such warnings may be overwhelmed by what Kass calls ``the technological
<br>
imperative''--whatever science can do, will be done. That imperative seems
<br>
irresistible because today's moral vocabulary is so impoverished that
<br>
society can hardly even formulate good intentions. Part of that vocabulary
<br>
is desiccated utilitarianism that weighs only tangible harms and benefits:
<br>
If something reduces an individual's suffering or improves an individual's
<br>
well-being, it should be done. Another part is simplistic
<br>
libertarianism--anything consensual should be permissible and anything that
<br>
expands choices is good.
<br>
<p>But it is not good, Kass insists, if human nature becomes just the last part
<br>
of nature turned into raw material for human willfulness. ANDi is an
<br>
intimation that nuclear explosions are not the only way science can end the
<br>
human story. Biology might do that more gradually than physics can, but no
<br>
less decisively, and even more repugnantly.
