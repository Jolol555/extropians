<em>&gt; You mean shitty here, yes? Having a slight cultural problem interpreting

</em><br>
<p><p>More or less.  &quot;totally ass&quot; is roughly equivalent to FUBAR or just
<br>
&quot;criminally deficient&quot;.  A left-over bit of vernacular from my college
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; SQL*Plus... urk. Hideous! There's no substitute, because that's what Oracle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ships, and that's that. It's a damned awful tool, though, a disgusting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kludge. Look at the way you have to generate scripts that generate scripts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which do the work; how hard would it be to provide real programming language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contructs like loops and conditionals and stuff (yes, I've seen people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulate these with bizzarre application of comments and environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variables in code generation)?
</em><br>
<p><p>Errrr....I take it that you don't really know how to use SQL*Plus?  Things
<br>
like conditionals, loops, etc are all supported natively inside SQL*Plus
<br>
without doing any of the stuff you are talking about.  In fact, the
<br>
SQL*Plus shell is actually quite powerful.  However, most people I know
<br>
who work on Oracle haven't figured out how to do all but the most
<br>
primitive things with SQL*Plus (usually limited to running queries,
<br>
compiling stored procedures, and spooling data).  Heck it took me quite a
<br>
number of years of working with SQL*Plus to really start exploiting its
<br>
capabilities.  There really isn't a whole lot you can do programmatically
<br>
that can't reasonably be done from SQL*Plus if you know what you are
<br>
doing, and the design is reasonable and consistent with CLI type
<br>
environments.  It is a very deep tool.
<br>
<p>The caveat being that it works better under Unix than Windows.  The
<br>
Windows version looks like a straight port where they didn't bother to
<br>
fork the code to accommodate differences in behavior between Windows and
<br>
Unix.  The Unix version is great because it integrates very well with the
<br>
normal unix command line (and all the normal unix utilities that go with
<br>
it), which makes sense because that is a large part of its heritage. 
<br>
Sun's systems have been the reference platform for development for many
<br>
years at Oracle.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I bet there are great tools, of course, to substitute for this crud, offered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by third parties. Must find myself one, preferably with a gui.
</em><br>
<p><p>Or you could learn to use the capabilities of the software you already
<br>
have. :^)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's not easy from Oracle, either; you need in depth arcane knowledge of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these 70's style crypto command line tools, which keeps skilled dbas on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravy train. Sorry, that's not fair, but I am a developer... I'm expected to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undervalue a DBA's role, it's a professional obligation :-)
</em><br>
<p><p>DBAs exist to keep developers from getting bored.  I could probably serve
<br>
as an Oracle DBA, but I wouldn't want to -- it is a very uninteresting
<br>
job.  In truth, the Oracle DBA command line is actually very consistent,
<br>
to the point that I can correctly guess the syntax and parameter formats
<br>
for commands that I don't know.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now you're talking! I find that delphi is so good, that it's quicker for me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to throw together a nice gui app to do something against Oracle, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, than it is to try to write cryptic SQL*Plus scripts.
</em><br>
<p><p>Whatever works for you, though a good working knowledge of PL/SQL is
<br>
extraordinarily useful if you want to push the runtime performance
<br>
envelope.  My work revolves a lot around application scalability.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; For instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had to do some pretty tight multithreading work myself lately, writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free threaded COM objects. Fire up Delphi, yet again, and use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TMultiReadExclusiveWrite object; it's stupidly simple to take care of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most common cases, without doing something dumb like using a mutex. 
</em><br>
<p><p>But what do you do when you are faced with an uncommon case?  Sometimes a
<br>
simple reader-writer lock is a pretty inefficient way to go.  In truth, I
<br>
often prefer to work with locking primitives because it allows me to
<br>
strictly control the behaviors of locks.  I don't re-invent locks
<br>
everytime a need a complicated one; I have well-worn libraries that have
<br>
all manners of unusual locks in them built on POSIX primitives.  Windows
<br>
threads are odd enough behavior-wise that they aren't really portable when
<br>
performance is a consideration.  One size fits all locking solutions (like
<br>
Java monitors &lt;shudder&gt;), can give poor performance for some applications
<br>
where desired thread behavior is more complicated (common when dealing with
<br>
scalability issues).  
<br>
<p>But these are my issues; most developers do just fine using off-the-shelf
<br>
bits without worrying about the internals.
