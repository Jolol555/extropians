<em>&gt; There are a lot of good coders / IT people on this list. The best evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is when someone asks a computer related question; the barrage of responses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is quite overwhelming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I bet it's boring as batshit for those who don't earn a crust this way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've often wanted to ask tech questions on list, but hesitated because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's not the list's purpose. I'm going out on a limb and assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is possibly not an uncommon experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should we (or someone) start an Extro IT self help list? So that all us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geekazoids can gather round, share knowledge, and beat each other over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head on fine points of technical dogma? It'd be fun, and probably damned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't think so.  Some of the tech stuff on here is what makes
<br>
the list interesting and lively.  I don't see anyone being offended by
<br>
it in any case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other thing this list is good at is answering science-related questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As an idea for positive PR, has anyone considered starting a website for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answering technical/science related questions, possibly aimed at younguns? A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of young people have questions to ask, and the people hereabouts answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such questions in not only informative, but fairly entertaining ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such a site could be an amalgam of website based forum &amp; mailing list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (giving people the opportunity to access it in either style), and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involve giving answers on a strictly voluntary basis (much as happens here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already). Think of it as a service to the community, and an excellent way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase exposure of extropian ideas which, after all, are supposed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven by facts and reasonable predictions. The most common experience here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that people come to &gt;H ideas by processing the information available to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them in their environment, and seek out Transhumanism or Extropianism after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are already converts. So, to spread the word, we would be best served
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in spreading information. And my bet is that the most likely demographic to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopt these ideas of an amazingly changed future are young people; those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without much attachment to the way things are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why nail down the technical form of the list early?  Such a list is a
<br>
good idea but there are already broad efforts to do this type of thing. 
<br>
Is another needed?  Does it necessarily have to do with Extropians?  Is
<br>
it a front for pulling people in?  If so then it seem a bit less than
<br>
honest.  Now an extropian outreach to the young (or young of mind &lt;g&gt;)
<br>
seems reasonable enough.
