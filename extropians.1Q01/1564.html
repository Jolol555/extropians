As I said, I haven't read the guy, and will not defend or excoriate 
<br>
his theories without having done so, however much of a nutball he was 
<br>
(or was not). There is no other reasonable course.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; If you judge theories on how they sound, then you are going to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many mistakes. Instead look at their predictions. Does it look like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all known orbital mechanics is dead wrong, the laws of thermodynamics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy conservation and momentum conservation are disobeyed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planetary masses and that every culture in the world except for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one at ground zero suffers collective amnesia of dramatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world-spanning events? Also, consider whether they can be falsified -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can you prove that Velikovsky's cosmic billiards did not happen when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he can (in principle, since he is dead) always blame lack of evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or contradictions on collective amnesia, changes in physics or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catastrophes being brief. I guess this may take longer to evaluate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 4.3 seconds, but not much longer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you do the same with quantum mechanics you get completely different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers. They might be weird, but they actually fit with known facts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only change the previously known laws of physics at certain scales and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole theory is quite falsifiable. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *&quot;I have already carefully read the first volume of the memoirs to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; “Worlds in Collision,” and have supplied it with a few marginal notes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in pencil that can be easily erased...&quot; --Albert Einstein, letter to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Immanuel Velikovsky, March 17, 1955 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **Apparently Mr. Einstein thought the matter warranted a wee bit more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than 4.3 seconds of &quot;his&quot; time--though it must be said that he did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not support the Venus contention, and found parts of V's works to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fanciful, as of 1954-55.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you know that followers of Willhelm Reich also claim that Einsteing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approved of his theories of orgone power? The real story is that Reich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often dragged over his neighbour in Princeton (?) to show his latest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gadgets like orgone boxes and cloud/anti-UFO cannons, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peace-loving Einstein never had the heart to tell him he was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crank. So his followers now claim Einstein supported Reich. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, even if Einstein had been the greatest admirer of Velikovsky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it doesn't improve the validity of his theories one bit. Arguments of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority have no place in science. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even an infinite posthuman lifespan is not long enough to consider all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forms of junk thinking - the cardinality of the set of incoherent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsupported or nonfalsifiable ideas is much larger than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cardinality of its complement.
