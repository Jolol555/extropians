<p>A transhuman AI doesn't *need* weapons of mass destruction.  So we may as

well minimize our problems by keeping WMDs out of the hands of humans.
<br>
<p>Obviously, I'm not advocating handing all the WMDs over to an &quot;orbiting

AI&quot; of human-equivalent or lesser capacity; *that* would be stupid.
