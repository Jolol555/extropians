<p>You describe a state of the mind. Assuming, it can be engineered? 
<br>
(Or think suicide, a trivial solution to your nonproblem). In any 
<br>
case, extrapolating the status quo witout the benefit of having 
<br>
been there strikes me as   premature?   disingenuous?

<p>The thing per se is nothing, the perception of the thing is everything.
<br>
&quot;Pretty and strong&quot; is not a property per se, it's an evaluation.

<em>&gt; A thousand years wise might mean something.  What, remains to be

<p>I'd like to point out that we currently don't have any baseline as 
<br>
to what a one kiloyear perspective *means*. Especially, if the human 
<br>
component can be engineered, to be able to better handle such a depth 
<br>
of temporal outlook. I don't think any of us is currently sustainably
<br>
capable of such an outlook, given the limitations of our hardware, 
<br>
but that's not the issue at hand. We'll deal with it when (if) we're
<br>
there. And deliberately abstracting &quot;wisdom&quot; from &quot;intelligence&quot; 
<br>
appears a rather cheap (albeit well-worn) intellectual trick.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; seen.  The fiction writers so far assume a great interest in either

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do read Sterling's HOLY FIRE.
</em><br>
<p>Why should fiction have any specific insights? Hint: don't assume your
<br>
audience to be imbeciles, at least not a priori.
