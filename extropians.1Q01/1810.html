<p>Nyah-nyah. You're wroooong! 
<br>
<p>C'mon, what's the best current resoltion of MRI on 
<br>
human head sized objects, about 250 um (0.25 mm) in
<br>
plane at 3 Tesla? I suggest you read
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lems.brown.edu/vision/courses/medical-imaging/projects/Cochlea/final_project.html">http://www.lems.brown.edu/vision/courses/medical-imaging/projects/Cochlea/final_project.html</a>
<br>
<p>to a nice intro of MRI state of the art and limitations.
<br>
Similiar limitations have xRay microscopy, and other noninvasive
<br>
methods. Invasive methods have no such limitations, of course.
<br>
CryoAFM can reach atomic resolution, but this has not yet been
<br>
tried on large biological specimens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; can you fit the beginning of a straight log plot to a straight log
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plot?  brain-imaging is born.
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea what you mean by this sentence. Brain imaging which
<br>
is worth the name (I could mention Herr Roentgen here) exists
<br>
about as long as we have intergrated circuits. Assuming early
<br>
MRI had cm resolution, progress to 0.25 mm does over the course
<br>
of few decades does not strike me as anything straight log plot
<br>
worthy. Unless you mean the number of voxels in the data set,
<br>
that would go up as n^3 with increased resolution. Of course,
<br>
we don't have the feature resolution going down linearly with
<br>
passage of time. High Tesla magnets and field homogeneity are
<br>
not an easy technology to scale. Plus, eventually the magnetic
<br>
field and the deposited RF energy will start harming the patient
<br>
(it already does, you have to program the pulse sequence properly,
<br>
and pushing a patient into a high Tesla magnet too rapidly will 
<br>
cause convulsions due to induced currents).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; this question struck me.  as though humanity will irrevocably begin to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach inside of itself (per the dictation of the recontextualization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of moore's machine law).
