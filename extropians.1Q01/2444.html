<em>&gt; &gt; The fact is that there are proposals to seed the oceans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with iron to stimulate plankton blooms which seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be the most effective way to sequester the huge amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of carbon that some claim we need to get rid of. Such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proposals are being ignored by global warming proponents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so it seems to me that they really don't have an interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in solving the problem. Why then would they seek to continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; harping on it without fixing it? Follow the money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure about this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would think - as a non-expert in these matters - that, if the green people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignore the seeding-oceans-with-iron proposition, this might be for entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical reasons. Their line of thinking might be like this: 'We hurt the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet by doing things the consequences of which we do not fully understand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, solving these issues by doing another thing we do not fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand is a bad idea, since it may very well turn out that we will do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even more damage.' If this is the way they are thinking, I would tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathise with them very much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Croatians have an expression that fits in this situation - &quot;Ne diraj lava
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dok spava.&quot; [Don't poke a lion while it sleeps.] If we know that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistic possibility that we might cause an ice age, but we are not sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe we should refrain from tampering with the planet until we are sure we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't doing ourselves major damage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am no expert in climate issues though. Although I too generally have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency to look for conspiracies, I am just trying to show that in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, there might not be a conspiracy after all.
</em><br>
<p>Calling my statements a 'conspiracy theory' is a bit harsh. People act
<br>
in their own self interest, or what they perceive as their own self
<br>
interest, even when they think they are being altruistic. Just as global
<br>
warming proponents willfully take money from the nuclear industry, and
<br>
the anti-nuke crowd takes money from the fossil fuels industry, people
<br>
act in their self interest. Just as the anti-nuke crowd opposes the
<br>
construction of breeder reactors here in the US for the simple reason
<br>
that such reactors would eliminate the problem of accumulating nuclear
<br>
waste (and thus they would have to get new jobs and wouldn't have the
<br>
waste issue to harp over), those yapping about global warming do so for
<br>
very self serving economic reasons, which are irrelevant to whether
<br>
there is a real problem or not. Because there is this conflict of
<br>
interest, it is very important to acknowledge the potential for
<br>
scientific fraud or at least self deception. The fact that parties
<br>
promoting the global warming 'problem' are opposed to its most effective
<br>
solution (which tests have shown have no bad side effects) indicates
<br>
that there is something besides altruism going on here.
