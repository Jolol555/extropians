<em>&gt;Thank you Chris, Barbara, Eugene (offline) and especially to Kat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(offline) for the information regarding Hofstadter's version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_Evgenij Onegin_.
</em><br>
<p>It should also be noted that a good (but not great) movie about Onegin came
<br>
out a year or so ago, with typically splendid acting from Ralph Fiennes
<br>
(perhaps my favorite actor).  As per this discussion, I will definitely
<br>
have to pick up the Hofstadter translation of _Evgenij Onegin_.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am skeptical of Hofstadter being a poet, that's why I wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get my hands on the book to see for myself. The original is generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considered, by the Russian-speaking folks I know, to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;untranslate-able, and the translator would have to be a poet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him/herself, and understand the style, emotions, etc. of Pushkin to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justice to the original.
</em><br>
<p>Though I have not read it yet (it is on my &quot;to-read&quot; bookshelf...),
<br>
Hofstadter's _Le Ton Beau de Marot_ is about interpretation and
<br>
translation, revolving primarily around little-known French poet Clement
<br>
Marot.  I remember Damien Broderick writing an excellent semi-review of it
<br>
on this list a couple of years ago.  Do you still have that, Damien?  Time
<br>
to check those archives...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I was thinking a lot during the last days of what it means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpret or translate another person's creative work. The first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question to ask of the translator is probably &quot;is he/she true to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;original?&quot; If the originator is *dead*, then one either must spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years in studying effects from that person, as well as studying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary medium (e.g. language) to express the work close to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;original, or else NOT... and then the viewer/reader/listener/etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must accept that the translated/interpretted work is &quot;derivative&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;evolved-in-time&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Just look at the Bible.  The amount of interpretations and translations
<br>
which have been derived from that book boggle the mind.  Regardless of any
<br>
list- member's individual views on Christian religion, it has to be
<br>
admitted that some (and perhaps all) of the interpretations and
<br>
translations have to be plain wrong.  If not, then it indicates the
<br>
acceptance of contradictions in the minds of the religious.  Not to dwell
<br>
on the subject, but one can take a look at the famous passage from
<br>
Corinthians; in the King James Bible, the key triad is &quot;...faith, hope and
<br>
charity [...] and the greatest of these is charity.&quot;  Yet when one looks at
<br>
the New International version, it is &quot;faith, hope and love.&quot;  Charity and
<br>
love are two entirely different concepts, and whether or not the original
<br>
interpretation meant one or the other, it is obvious that there are some
<br>
serious flaws in the translation process... intentional or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the music world, musicians and conductors have to face this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation every day when interpreting works from long-dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;composers. For example, I would prefer (the contemporary musician)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nigel Kennedy's renditions of works of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Vivaldi, Sibelius (Violin Concerto in D minor never fails to bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tears to my eyes) over any other classical musician at any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time.
</em><br>
<p>Music is perhaps the only art in which emulation/interpretation can be as
<br>
creative as new compositions.  Though I generally prefer newer music on the
<br>
avant-garde, I have heard some wonderful renditions of old classics which
<br>
are both creative and still retain the essence of the original (a great
<br>
example of this is George Winston's 5 &amp; 1/2 minute rendition of Pachabel's
<br>
Canon in D).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The lyric poem is divided in 4 ways, three quatrains (4-line verse),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each with a rhyme scheme of its own, usually alternating lines, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a concluding &quot;couplet&quot; at the end that rhymes. The typical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Shakespearean sonnet rhyme scheme is &quot;abab cdcd efef gg.&quot; The couplet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the end is often a commentary on the preceding quatrains.
</em><br>
<p>It is interesting that the sonnet form caught on so quickly after Thomas
<br>
Wyatt brought it back from Italy (originally devised by an Italian named
<br>
Petrarch). Wyatt's most famous poem is both a combination of translation
<br>
(most of it), as well as a mirror of his own situation (it refers to his
<br>
mistress, Anne Boelin):
<br>
<p>THE HIND (aka WHOSO LIST TO HUNT)
<br>
<p>Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind
<br>
But as for me, helas! I may no more.
<br>
The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,
<br>
I am of them that furthest come behind.
<br>
Yet may I, by no means, my wearied mind
<br>
Draw from the deer; but as she fleeth afore
<br>
Fainting I follow.  I leave off therefore,
<br>
Since in a net I seek to hold the wind.
<br>
Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,
<br>
As well as I, may spend his time in vain;
<br>
And graven with diamonds in letters plain
<br>
There is written, her fair neck round about,
<br>
&quot;Noli me tangere, for Caesar's I am,
<br>
And wild for to hold, though I seem tame&quot;
<br>
<p>-Thomas Wyatt (1503-1542)
<br>
<p>It is interesting to note that the English language is (in the early 16th
<br>
century) quite legible and understandable by today's standards, yet when
<br>
one reads Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_ from ~130 years earlier, its
<br>
language is quite hard to understand.  That epic poem is another good
<br>
example of how interpretations, while necessary, can detract from the
<br>
intended meanings put forth by the author.  The Nevill Coghill translation
<br>
is the easiest to read, but is arguably &quot;lighter&quot; than the original.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Therefore, a translator, to be true to the originals, would not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to keep the form of the poem, but would also need to keep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;images, metaphors, mood, and perhaps the context of the time (in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;examples: to 16th century Britain.
</em><br>
<p>There's no question that Hofstadter would be the best kind of person to do
<br>
translations.  If only he would take a stab at Dostoyevsky...
