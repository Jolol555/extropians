<p>I do not see these guys as third ways -- unless by &quot;third way&quot; you mean a

halfway house between the other two.

</em><br>
<p>I don't look down on political philosophy, though I look down on certain
<br>
wrong political philosophies.
<br>
<p>By what means does one &quot;to judge issues on a case-by-case, situationalist
<br>
(posthuman aesthetic) way?&quot;  That would seem to mean to me an implicit,
<br>
tacit political philosophy as opposed to an explicit one.  The latter is
<br>
easier to examine.  (Also, I think such &quot;case-by-case&quot; thinking is just how
<br>
the average person and politician approaches matters.  This is how we get
<br>
people who say they are for freedom of expression, but against expression
<br>
they or well established find offensive, such as people who against anyone
<br>
making anti-Christian art.)
<br>
<p>I think also there is a difference between having a rule in this area and
<br>
having principles.  The latter are contextual and open-ended, the former are
<br>
neither.  Most people I know don't think of the latter as an alternative to
<br>
the former.  They are suspicious of any systematic thinking.  I'm not.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
