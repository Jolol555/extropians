<em>&gt;Note that the NYT seems to have resolved the issue--all links to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;articles (so far as I know) run you into their entry page, where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must enter registration info. You are then forwarded to the linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;page. Wonder if this can be done w/o the registration bit? All links
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diverting to a &quot;start&quot; page?
</em><br>
<p>I haven't looked at it, but I'd guess that's basically a cookie 
<br>
mechanism.  If you don't have the &quot;logged in&quot; cookie, it throws you 
<br>
to the login page.  If you used something similar to prevent deep 
<br>
linking, you'd probably catch the first occurrence, but subsequent 
<br>
ones would let you through.
<br>
<p>A better solution would probably be to have some dynamic renaming 
<br>
system that frequently re-maps the files to new URLs.  Any specific 
<br>
URL should only last a few hours or a day (depending on what you're 
<br>
trying to accomplish).  That way, no one could really expect to 
<br>
maintain deep links to your pages.  Everyone would have to start at 
<br>
your commonly-accessed gateway to get the current links.
<br>
<p>Just an idea.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
