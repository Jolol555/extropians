<em>&gt;Does anyone know what the law says about &quot;deep linking&quot;. Say you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;write some comments on an article appearing on a magazine's Web 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;page, and you link directly to the article. (The article appears in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a new browser, exactly as it would appear if the viewer had gone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there directly.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What if the magazine sent you a Cease and Desist letter, and told 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you that it did not permitting linking to its content (which is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freely open to the public), only to its main page?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This sounds ridiculous to me. The magazine would be turning away 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freely given traffic that it would otherwise not receive. What I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really interested in is not so much the silliness of such a policy, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but whether an online magazine can legally enforce such a claim. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would think the law does *not* support this, but sometimes &quot;the law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is an ass&quot;, so I'm asking the many-brained List if it knows the law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in this area.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can't imagine telling someone, &quot;No, no, I don't permit you to link 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to The Extropian Principles. You may only link to my home page.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thanks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>I do not know the law in this area, but that won't stop me from answering!
<br>
<p>As an IT consultant, I have seen about a dozen clients either sue 
<br>
another company for linking to them or get sued for linking to other 
<br>
sites.  I do not think the law has a clear-cut answer, but I know 
<br>
that lawsuits will occur if the web-sites link to other sites that do 
<br>
not want to be linked.
<br>
<p>Many web-sites make money from advertising or other services offered 
<br>
from their main page.  If you link directly to the content, you are 
<br>
extracting the benefit of their enticement without giving them the 
<br>
benefit of having a visitor view their main page.  They feel that 
<br>
this is unfair use of their efforts while robbing them of the benefit 
<br>
of a potential customer.  They would claim that this would be like 
<br>
rebroadcasting a TV show without the commercials, or picking up your 
<br>
&quot;free gift&quot; without listening to the sales pitch.  Such sites to not 
<br>
really intend to provide their content to the public.  As they get 
<br>
more sophisticated, such sites usually require free registration, 
<br>
personalized logins or some other gimmick to force users to go 
<br>
through the top level.
<br>
<p>Such sites can take legal or technical actions to block the linking 
<br>
if they want.  The battle may not be worth the linking, and any 
<br>
successful linking may not last for long.  I would suggest linking to 
<br>
the top level while giving specific directions on how to find the 
<br>
article from there.  E.g, visit google.com and enter &quot;extropians&quot; in 
<br>
the search box.
