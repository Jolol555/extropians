Sure, and other people waste inordinate amounts of time on subjects I
<br>
could care little or less than nothing about, and which IMHO have
<br>
absolutely nothing to do with extropy, and which do nothing for me but
<br>
waste my bandwidth and mailbox space. I don't, however, get all anal
<br>
retentive about it, I don't rant on and on about how they get off over
<br>
it or make aspersions to their sexual adequacy. Because I don't exhibit
<br>
such behavior, and people like Joe and yourself do, I find it hard to
<br>
take seriously him or anyone who allies themeselves with him.
<br>
<p>I did not restart this thread, and I have repeatedly requested that it
<br>
be moved to exi-freedom, so I can't take your complaints of my behavior
<br>
seriously if you continue to pout and stamp your footies about it.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I might also note that you followed this post by no less than 6 posts in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which you mention either GUNZ, Joe Dees... or both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...and I just wasted fifteen minutes of my morning thinking about this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infernal subject.
</em><br>
<p>And I wasted two hours wading through the garbage that some other people
<br>
consider worthwhile. We all have bad days. Fortunately for me, Joe is no
<br>
longer a part of them. If you don't filter him out, then the problem is
<br>
with YOU, not me.
