<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ok then look at this:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;<a href="http://lw.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?Section=Artic">http://lw.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?Section=Artic</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;les&amp;SubSection=Display&amp;ARTICLE_ID=87762&amp;VERSION_NUM=1
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It's an article on how fiber to the home is happening today, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a 100mbit ethernet link into the house.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;Disclaimer: My opinions are my own, I do not speak for
<br>
SBC/Ameritech&gt;
<br>
<p>We're on the same wavelength Brian, I was reading that same article
<br>
yesterday when I visited the site. ;)
<br>
<p>Our problem isn't technological, its political.
<br>
<p>10 years ago I was part of a very ambitious project who's mission
<br>
statement was to have fiber installed at every Ameritech site by
<br>
the year 2000. As I said, then the long distance companies,
<br>
interaccess carriers, cable companies, state and federal regulators
<br>
got involved, regulated the crap out of us and killed the deal. And
<br>
they've been bitching at us ever since, wanting to know when we're
<br>
going to build it.
<br>
<p>Here's my personal brief synopsis of the result of these regulatory
<br>
efforts.
<br>
<p>If we were to build a fiber network:
<br>
<p>1) We can't charge the ratepayers for doing so, the expense would
<br>
have to come out of our profits.
<br>
<p>COMMENTARY: This alone wasn't the deal killer, we were still
<br>
willing to do this, but they weren't done yet.
<br>
<p>2) 80% of the bandwidth was reserved for competitors.
<br>
<p>COMMENTARY: Not only was 80% of the bandwidth reserved for
<br>
competitors, but under the pricing plan, they could get access for
<br>
less than we charged ourselves.
<br>
<p>3) The RBOC's are prevented from entering any new business
<br>
<p>COMMENTARY: We currently are restricted to local service only, if
<br>
you want to call another customer 50 miles away, by law it has to
<br>
go via either an interaccess carrier, or a long distance carrier,
<br>
we cannot by law complete that call ourselves.
<br>
<p>Not only are we still barred from long distance, but effectively
<br>
barred from any other value added business that might actually be
<br>
worth getting into the fiber business for.
<br>
<p>4) The &quot;competitors&quot; have a say-so in the deployment.
<br>
<p>COMMENTARY: Yep, not only are we subsidizing our so-called
<br>
competition, but THEY get to decide when and where we are going to
<br>
be allowed to deploy it.
<br>
<p>So now you have my personal opinion as to why we're not living in
<br>
a fiber-optic wonderland.
<br>
<p>We're standing here with our hands cuffed behind our backs, gagged,
<br>
blindfolded, with corks in our ears, a hood over our heads, wrapped
<br>
head to toe in chains, our feet cast in concrete, suspended from a
<br>
crane over lake Michigan..... and people want to know &quot;Why haven't
<br>
they built a fiber network yet? Don't they get it?&quot;
<br>
