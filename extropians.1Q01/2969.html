<p>Actually, I don't think I ever implied that we need to set up a backup on
<br>
Mars by, dunno, my birthday next year. You say that &quot;the Mars direct
<br>
approach would take decades to build up that kind of presence and
<br>
civilization on Mars&quot;. &quot;Decades&quot; sounds great to me. What I don't like is
<br>
&quot;centuries&quot;.
<br>
<p>Given enough time, sooner or later we will do it. What I was suggesting is
<br>
that we do something to make it happen sooner: increase funding, or change
<br>
regulations in a smart way, or anything. Just so it happens sooner than it's
<br>
going to at the current pace of things, because we probably don't have a lot
<br>
of time to spare.
<br>
