<p>I can offer my $0.02 on this, seeing as I am currently &quot;young.&quot;  I am not,
<br>
however, a participant in pop culture, but I don't think that precludes me
<br>
from answering.  I simply cannot see a &quot;pop&quot; artist lasting more than a year
<br>
or so, much less being listened to a long time from now.
<br>
<p>Some acts/singers/musicians I can see being listened to in the future:
<br>
<p>1.  Radiohead
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the big one, the one that I think will make the long haul easier
<br>
than all the rest.  In fact, I can imagine my kids asking me &quot;Did you see
<br>
Radiohead live?&quot; much as today's kids ask their parents about the Beatles,
<br>
when they discover them as many people in my generation have.
<br>
(Unfortunately, I have not seen them.  I have heard that Tom York, the lead
<br>
singer, is absolutely amazing live.  More on him later.)  They have it all:
<br>
immense musical talent, an understanding of nuance and subtlety, the ability
<br>
to translate raw emotion into compressed waves of air, hidden allusions to
<br>
their musical influences, and the guts and ability to drive music into new
<br>
frontiers.  The band is excellent, each musician blending seamlessly into
<br>
the mix, while letting his personal style show through.  Tom York, the
<br>
singer, has a unique voice, and the ability to shape it to the needs of the
<br>
song.  They also have the ability, due to their popularity, to try new
<br>
things, and hope that people will follow them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very Extropian music, in style, though some reviewers say their music is
<br>
about the emptiness and futility of modern technological life.  Most of the
<br>
lyrics are vague enough (like all good lyrics) to be construed as about the
<br>
futility of modern non-self-empowered life.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, THE BAND to watch in the future
<br>
<p>2.  Dave Matthews Band (specifically, Dave Matthews)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me say that I don't own pants with multiple pockets, a vest
<br>
jacket, any baseball caps, or anything from Abercrombie and Fitch.  Don't
<br>
let the fans of this band fool you, they have true talent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, Dave Matthews does.  His songs have an earthy, folksy feeling,
<br>
but his style (complex, melodic guitar rhythms in place of chords) is very
<br>
imaginative and creative.  His voice is also unique, a sometimes gravelly,
<br>
sometimes slightly twangy mix, but it carries the full spectrum of
<br>
expression well.  His solo acoustic performances are legendary.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band is good, especially on albums, when they can work over a piece
<br>
until its right, but in live performances they get carried away by the
<br>
audience into over-performing.  They are all good musicians except one:  the
<br>
drummer, Carter Beauford.  He is amazing.  You can hear everything from
<br>
African rhythms to swing to jazz to bebop to modern fusion in his involved,
<br>
flowing rhythms.  I have friends who have studied drums for years who hear
<br>
something new every time he plays.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This band will survive, and be one of the groups your kids will not be
<br>
ashamed that you listened to them.
<br>
<p>Actually, searching through my CD collection and my memory, I can't think of
<br>
any other bands that will be have such long-lasting effects as these two.
<br>
There are others which will survive the decades, but these two are the two
<br>
to watch.
<br>
<p>Of course, my own tastes are varied, and I know of many other groups which
<br>
are excellent, but will probably not be recognized in the future.  Though I
<br>
can justify this thread because it vaguely relates to &quot;the future,&quot; those of
<br>
you who want to know my opinion on current great albums will have to inquire
<br>
off-list.
<br>
<p>Josh
