I thought about particle beam defense against rogue nano back in 1987.
<br>
There are lots of infrastructure problems. But anything that
<br>
concentrates a high enough energy flux density ought to work as a &quot;spot
<br>
eradicator&quot;. The remaining problem, as 'gene has recently pointed out,
<br>
is &quot;What if you're not seeing spots?&quot; :)
<br>
<p>_My_ read on &quot;active shields&quot; remains that you are conflating two
<br>
things. Active shields don't have to be any smarter that land mines in
<br>
the containment case, or an immune system in the more general case. How
<br>
smart to make the immune system, and how to direct it, are very much
<br>
open questions.
<br>
<p>Central control of the entire world's immune system by a single AI? Show
<br>
me where Dr. D. says that, would you?
<br>
<p>PS: Are you also checking www.nanodot.com? A fair amount of good stuff
<br>
there.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Marlow's Paradox:

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;“We cannot entrust our fate to machines without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;emotions, for they have no compassion; we cannot

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;are unpredictable.”
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Basically, we can't trust machines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And what's different about people?  We have checks

<em>&gt; &gt; and balances in goverment, contracts and arbiters in

<em>&gt; &gt; business, credit checks and gossip in personal life,
