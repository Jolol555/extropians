<p>
Word has now reached me that there are multiple rumors circulating about a
<br>
clash between Marvin Minsky and Eliezer Yudkowsky at a Foresight event.
<br>
<p>This is what it looked like from my perspective:
<br>
<p>Minsky's talk followed mine at the Fall 2000 Senior Associates Gathering. 
<br>
During his talk, Marvin Minsky raised the subject of the Riemann
<br>
Hypothesis Catastrophe (as named, and credited to Minsky, in the
<br>
forthcoming paper &quot;Friendly AI&quot;) - that an AI asked to solve the Riemann
<br>
Hypothesis would convert the Solar System into computronium.  Since I'd
<br>
just given a talk that touched on Friendly AI, during the discussion
<br>
period I tried to offer a reply.  I started out by stating that, under
<br>
most definitions of Friendliness, the Riemann Hypothesis Catastrophe would
<br>
constitute a subgoal stomping on a supergoal.  Minsky then interrupted to
<br>
say that he didn't believe anyone could give a real definition of
<br>
Friendliness.  I said that I'd get around to that in a minute, but
<br>
meanwhile I wanted to deal with the scenario as stated.  Minsky then said,
<br>
I believe, &quot;Get this person away from the microphone.&quot;  I said &quot;What?&quot; and
<br>
then found Christine Peterson at my side, asking me to just come away.
<br>
<p>I have no idea why Marvin Minsky did that.  I hadn't been impolite.  I
<br>
hadn't done anything at all that would call for a response on that level. 
<br>
I felt insulted and, to be honest, pretty deeply hurt.  My impression was
<br>
that Minsky had essentially used his superior status to lash out at me,
<br>
then he forgot about it.
<br>
<p>I'd planned to forget about it too.  That there are still ripples from
<br>
this incident deeply disturbs me; that rumors describe the incident as
<br>
argumentative and heated, symmetrically between me and Minsky, disturbs me
<br>
a lot more.  What happened is that Minsky, for no reason I can determine,
<br>
put me down.  I didn't even hit back.  I just said &quot;What?&quot;  Now, as a
<br>
result, I'm winding up with a reputation for not being able to hold my
<br>
temper.  I guess the popular view of me is such that people find it easy
<br>
to imagine me lashing right back at Minsky.  In person, at least, I'm not
<br>
like that.  I don't think I've ever in my life gotten into a shouting
<br>
match over an intellectual disagreement.
<br>
<p>It seems I was wrong not to discuss the incident.  I have no particular
<br>
interest in pursuing a grudge with Marvin Minsky, though I'll confess that
<br>
I felt pretty disillusioned then and I still feel disillusioned now.  For
<br>
the record, I didn't do anything to attack Minsky or defend myself, I
<br>
didn't write anything at all about the incident, until I found out the
<br>
hard way that the ripples hadn't just died out - that they were, in fact,
<br>
affecting other people considering me as a possible speaker.  This post is
<br>
to make clear my view of what happened, and I'd like to ask all of you to
<br>
forward it on wherever these rumors are discussed.
