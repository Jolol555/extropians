<p><em>&gt;&gt;Obviously I think raising and harvesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;engineered disencephalatic clones is going to be a slightly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;difficult proposition than planting weed seeds in dirt.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Why would hiding a few pounds worth of synthetic organs be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult than hiding thousands of tons of marijuana? 
</em><br>
<p>Organs go bad very quickly, like 72 hours tops. And this is not
<br>
about how valuable these organs would be, the question is where
<br>
would they come from?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why would the demand for synthetic organs be less than the demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for marijuana? 
</em><br>
<p>I would think the demand for these organs would be high.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why would the profits from the illicit organ trade be less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that of the illicit drug trade? 
</em><br>
<p>I believe the profits would be exceptional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why would you find few people willing to engage in such a risky
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but enormously profitable enterprise when many thousand take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;similar risks in the drug trade?
</em><br>
<p>Because a bunch of illiterates hanging out in the jungle, or
<br>
trailer parks in backwater U.S can be in the drug trade.
<br>
<p>We're not talking about a bunch of people standing around a vat
<br>
with plant leaves and household chemicals here. You are talking
<br>
about bioengineering on a scale that does not even exist today.
<br>
We're talking multiple Phd's here, in a very impressive/expensive
<br>
facility.
<br>
<p>What nation would permit this?
<br>
<p>Other than William Gibson's &quot;Chiba City&quot;.
