Interesting stuff. A few probs:
<br>
<p>&quot;What we must hope, as the juggernaut of technological change rolls 
<br>
onward, is that material incentives alone really are not more 
<br>
important than other driving forces of the human spirit.&quot;
<br>
<p>Taken a look around South Central lately? Liverpool, perhaps? In many 
<br>
places, a quick high seems the driving force of the human spirit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	&quot;The steel tortoise gave MacKinnon a feeling of Crusoe-like 
</em><br>
independence. It did not occur to him his chattel was the end product 
<br>
of the cumulative effort and intelligent co-operation of hundreds of 
<br>
thousands of men, living and dead.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nor, indeed, will it occur to those who will be asked to contribute 
<br>
to the support of the unemployable masses. They will refuse.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, and plenty of others here, surely didn't like it one little bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's a slab from THE SPIKE that amplifies this perspective a tad:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ==========================
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The dividend of history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The run up to the Spike will deepen today's dreadful problems, but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ease their solution, if we keep our nerve and use our brains. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	A corporation that downsizes its work-force today, in favour of robots, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surviving as a beneficiary of the human investment of the past. Its current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productivity, after all, is the outcome of every erg of accumulated human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort that went into creating the economy and technological culture that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made those robots possible. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	So let's not look at a guaranteed income as a `natural right', like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed innate rights to freedom of speech and liberty. Rather, it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inheritance, something owed to all the children of a society whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestors for generations have together built, and purchased through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work of their minds and hands, the resource base sustaining today's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cornucopia. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Committed to the present structure of society--a prejudice doomed in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, as we have seen, by the on-coming Spike--some people believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of their fellow humans won't work without an external goad. Others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that incentives are required, but hold that these can spring from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within, and need not depend upon the threat of hunger and destitution. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the short run, this debate can be avoided, for a guaranteed income would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abolish severe poverty more effectively than current schemes that tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act as a disincentive to taking up part-time work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	And while a guaranteed wage would ensure you the bare necessities, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; craving for luxuries and a higher standard of living would hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappear. Few of us now are content merely to earn a subsistence income.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who are--the `shiftless scoundrels' who live their rudimentary life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ease on the dole in sunny climes--will continue to do so, but without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costing society the extra burden of trying to hunt them down and punish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them for refusing to take the jobs that don't exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	What we must hope, as the juggernaut of technological change rolls onward,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that material incentives alone really are not more important than other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driving forces of the human spirit. The artist and the scientist are two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; celebrated instances of a deep human hunger and enthusiasm for creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity, the kind that draws people together while being intensely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewarding to the individual. It's very likely, no doubt, that some arduous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs traditionally the domain of depressed and excluded groups would find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no takers if survival were no longer at stake. In wealthy nations like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States, bordering less well-off countries, a constant influx of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illegal migrants testifies to the reluctance of citizens with high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectations to do the sweaty work. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Return to the village
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The impulse to automate such unpleasant activities, or design around them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is thus intensified. If nobody can be found to take the nasty jobs, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportion of such unrewarding tasks delegated to machines will grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (thankfully) until people are free of them for good. And in many cases, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can expect that nano minting and AI systems will simply wipe many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst kinds of odious toil off the agenda forever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Hans Moravec puts it succinctly: `In the short run this threatens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unemployment and panicked scrambles for new ways to earn a living. In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medium run, it is a wonderful opportunity to recapture the comfortable pace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a tribal village while retaining benefits of technological evolution. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the long run, it marks the end of the dominance of biological humans, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beginning of the age of robots' (Robot, p. 131).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	The anthropologist Conrad Arensberg claimed that every successful adaptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation, social or biological, always has a further effect than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate and conservative: `the opening of a vast new door, a splendid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serendipity'. It is impertinent and finally futile to try to anticipate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serendipity, but it seems fair to assume that the adoption of a general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to a share in the inherited productivity of the human race will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberating, more often than not, to the spirit. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pre-paid lunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surprisingly, the laissez-faire writer Robert A. Heinlein placed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentiment in the mouth of a utopian judge condemning a reckless rugged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualist: `From a social standpoint, your delusion makes you as mad as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a March Hare.' But it was Heinlein himself, coiner of the libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogan TANSTAAFL (`There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch'), who, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrator, offered the most stinging commentary:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	&quot;The steel tortoise gave MacKinnon a feeling of Crusoe-like independence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It did not occur to him his chattel was the end product of the cumulative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort and intelligent co-operation of hundreds of thousands of men, living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dead.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted this perspective, how should we arrange our affairs during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disruptive decades ahead? The ways in which science and technology were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (ab)used in the last century powered a catastrophic erosion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biodiversity, and in doing so damaged human communities as well. The global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy is still felling rain forests, polluting the skies and scything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the diversity of species. In the long run, in a world of televised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fantasy living and virtual reality simulation--let alone the Spike's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine intelligence and nanotechnology--such traditional methods will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altogether unstable. Should we put an end, for the moment, to conspicuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption? Yet it is exactly the economy of relentless and often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trivialised consumption that drives the technologies that will peak in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cornucopia of the Spike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ======================================
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Last time around on this topic, four years or so back, Robin Hanson as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; house economist was highly skeptical of claims that a Guaranteed Income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Floor would work in the boot-strapping manner alleged by Robert Theobald.
