Warning, nonextropian silliness follows.  Brace yourself for
<br>
the next Taxifornia export...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Californians have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very nasty habit of exporting their problems to Washington
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (First it was traffic, now its energy shortages. I wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it will be next?).
</em><br>
<p>Brace yourself Robert.  The next thing coming your way is...
<br>
Sound of Music singalongs.  In San Francisco, down in the
<br>
Castro district, they are having Sound of Music on the big screen,
<br>
with a dress-up audience participation singalong kinda like
<br>
Rocky Horror Picture Show, only with faux nuns, complete
<br>
with curlers under their wimples.  Of course, no one who is
<br>
not a nun has a clue what a wimple is, however there are
<br>
plenty of guys in pink and white trying to dress up as one.
<br>
<p>The guest star is Charmian Carr who played that babe-alicious
<br>
eldest daughter Leisl.  Shes 58 going on 59, and *still* truly
<br>
dazzling after all these years.  Rumor has it that she will come
<br>
dressed up in a dominatrix outfit.  Dry this time.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, this all sounded like a hoot, so I talked my wife
<br>
into going, but so far havent convinced her to be seen
<br>
with me in the costume I proposed.
<br>
<p>Oh, yes, the costume contest.  The &quot;Sisters&quot; of Perpetual
<br>
Motion showed up, one of which is said to be an actual
<br>
woman, but no one knows which.
<br>
<p>A woman in a white dress had every favorite thing physically
<br>
attached to her person: door bells and sleigh bells, wild geese,
<br>
cream colored ponies, even schnitzel with noodles.
<br>
<p>A group of men and women dressed in curtains.
<br>
<p>A man in pink piegnoir, white boa, disheveled platinum
<br>
wig, fuzzy slippers, carrying a cane and an empty liquor
<br>
bottle.  He was the baroness 20 yrs after being dumped
<br>
by the Captain.
<br>
<p>Friday's winner, a woman in olive drab with black balloons
<br>
attached to her head and shoulders.  Her character:
<br>
the lonely goat turd.
<br>
<p>So I was in the costume shop and they had an SNL
<br>
conehead thing, and I got an idea.  Take some pine
<br>
cones, cut off the, um, thingies that pine cones have
<br>
on em, put on the conehead getup and glue these thingies
<br>
all over it and all over my face.  Hang a sign around
<br>
my neck with arrows pointing upwards and the words
<br>
^ MARIA SIT HERE ^
<br>
<p>So far the negotiation is more or less at a standstill
<br>
as Shelly is just a wee bit on the square side of hip.
<br>
She agrees to go as Maria but refuses to be seen with
<br>
me should I go down to the SF gay district dressed as
<br>
that silly pine cone.
<br>
<p>Too bad too, for it would surely win the contest.
<br>
<p>So bad news, all you innocents outside of Taxifornia.
<br>
The Sound of Music singalong is coming...
<br>
