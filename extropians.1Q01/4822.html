<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that people of the Jewish culture are less antagonistic 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; to cryo-Extro-life-extension ideas. Arlene Sheskin's book _Cryonics_ 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; included a survey of cryonicists from about 25 years ago. Some very 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; large percentage of cryos in her survey were Jewish. Admittedly, many of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; them apparently came from the New York area, but it was a very large 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; percentage--perhaps 25-50%. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Jewish society, with rare exceptions, is not at all technophobic. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;However, there were increasing signs of infection at the time that I left 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;physically (mentally, I'd left a long time ago), so get them while you 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;can. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;If I had to guess, I'd guess that it has something to do with (a) the fact 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that rabbis derive religious authority from their technical expertise on 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the amazingly complicated laws, and (b) the amazingly complicated laws 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;soak up all the religious fervor, leaving none for traditional Luddite 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;fundamentalism. Though, when I left, there were signs of growing 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;infection; predator memes moving into the ecological void.
