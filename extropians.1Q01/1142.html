<em>&gt; Spudboy forwards:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; NEW YORK (Jan. 12) - The mystery invention code-named ''Ginger'' that has set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the technology world abuzz may be little more than a motorized miniscooter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; judging from a recent patent application that came to light on Friday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, this was discussed here a couple of days ago in a post Max forwarded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However I believe a lightweight, motorized platform able to go up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down curbs and stairs, with a clean, quiet non-polluting engine and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamic balancing capability does qualify for much of the hype which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been surrounding it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure it will take off except as a toy/sport, especially in a
<br>
country like the US. Personally I am not that interested in being &quot;freed&quot;
<br>
from my car, except for having to do the actual driving. In many cases I
<br>
would prefer to have a computer drive it for me. THAT would be a big break-
<br>
through. There's no way I would drive a little scooter around for my day
<br>
to day tasks if I could also afford a car- not safe enough, probably slower
<br>
for any distances over a mile or two, can't haul much if anything, etc.
<br>
<p>I'm not even sure I would buy it for fun since I prefer to probably ride
<br>
a mountain bike and get some exercise at the same time.
