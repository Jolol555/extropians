It appears as if Ross A. Finlayson &lt;<a href="mailto:raf@tiki-lounge.com?Subject=Re:%20No%20Federal%20parole&In-Reply-To=&lt;200102020022.BAA07890@color.sics.se&gt;">raf@tiki-lounge.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<br>
<p>THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING THE SUBJECT! AT EASE!
<br>
HERE, HAVE A DISCUSSION TOKEN! FORM A QUEUE!
<br>
<p>There. Now we can continue.
<br>
<p>So, does anybody see re-programming of nasty criminals and sociopaths
<br>
into law-abiding and caring people, pillars of society, in the cards?
<br>
Or will the mediaeval methods of incarcenation, torture, and death
<br>
continue to be used against the social problem of crime? It seems such
<br>
a waste of resources. Ah, well..
<br>

<br>
<p>|You say some felons some are not citizens, do you say they are not human?

<br>

<br>
<p>Excellent rhetoric. Postulate a falsehood, then attack your opponent using it.
<br>
You have not considered a political career?
<br>
<p>I wish to congratulate you. Your call for the mediaeval dungeon method
<br>
really hit the spot:
<br>

<br>
Reprogramming except in the context of regular education through trade skill and
<br>
literary learning and punishments for violent behavior, should not be a focus.  It
<br>
sounds too cavalier to apply your meat rules to the brains of these prisoners.
<br>
<p>If, after valid psychological examination in a psychologically healthy environment, it
<br>
is determined a mild sedative will help the prisoner cope with his violence issues, then
<br>
that may be prescribed.
<br>
<p>In this thread I permuted the subject to &quot;No Parole for Federales&quot; to suggest to apply
<br>
the cane to them.
<br>

<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I fail to see the romance in it. In fact, as a transhumanist,
<br>
I _insist_ on more modern and civilized methods. Why should your obsolescent
<br>
correctional methods be allowed to stop the market for better, more efficient,
<br>
and cheaper correctional methods?
<br>
<p>Welcome back to the Institute, Alex.
