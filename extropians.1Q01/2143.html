<p><em>&gt; Being an usual admirer of George Will's writing I was disappointed

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What about cloning for body part replacements?  Is all you are simply a
<br>
&quot;phenotype&quot;?  Do you believe that you have the right to keep others from
<br>
extending their lives by any and all means that do not violate the
<br>
rights of others?  Is it your business to decide whether or not this or
<br>
that individual or all such individuals 'deserve' to live longer or to
<br>
create more copies of themselves by means of sex (partial copies) or
<br>
cloning (total genetic copies)?  No?  Then I do not understand the above
<br>
statement.  'Merit it' according to whom?  Continued life is its own
<br>
merit.  
<br>
<p>Now, if you mean simply making copies of myself, I would say that too
<br>
could have merit if those copies can support themselves productively. 
<br>
Who would decide who should be cloned or not?  Why not simply let the
<br>
market decide?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Deliberate cloning is low breed stuff, or to put it in an easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreadable meme:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;cloning is for livestock.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You are welcome to your opinion, of course, just as long as you don't
<br>
wish to see it enforced as more than that.
