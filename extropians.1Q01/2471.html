<p>These are not universal taboos.  Many cultures and ancient tribes and 
<br>
civilizations practiced incest, murder, rape, theft, etc.  Incest was 
<br>
often used to keep royal, priestly or tribal blood lines pure. 
<br>
Murder was common-place between warring factions, and was often 
<br>
ritualized into their religions.  Rape was rarely seen as a taboo 
<br>
since woman often did not have rights in many societies.  (Only 
<br>
raping someone else's woman was seen as a crime of property theft.) 
<br>
Theft itself was commonplace between different tribes or warring 
<br>
nations.  Not only would I argue against these taboos being 
<br>
universal, I daresay the reverse was true.  Incest, murder, rape and 
<br>
theft probably were more common historically than today.
