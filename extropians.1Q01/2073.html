</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Most people would agree with you.  I personally don't have any sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;knee-jerk animosity towards Microsoft.  However as a software developer, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;am exposed to parts of the Microsoft world that are very objectionable on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;many different levels.  Unless you write software though, you aren't likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to see or understand these strong objections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is true.  Microsoft plays dirty tricks to sabotage the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition.  Most people will not have debugged Microsoft's stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to figure out what is going on inside.  Not to start an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-Microsoft discussion, but here are some examples:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - font smoother in Windows serves smooth fonts to Internet Explorer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and jagged fonts to Netscape
</em><br>
<p>This is a matter of Netscape not taking advantage of this in their own
<br>
programming, so you are blaming the wrong person here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - server serves Internet Explorer first but delays serving Netscape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - server refuses to give Netscape common gif or jpeg formats, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serves an error message that Netscape can't display these images but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet Explorer can
</em><br>
<p>What is funny is that this has bitten them in the butt. A while back
<br>
they released a bad version of Media Viewer that would screw up Explorer
<br>
and other applications (netscape, ventura, draw, etc), such that you had
<br>
to reinstall IE 5 to fix this. When I went to the microsoft website to
<br>
download IE5, their download server was set to not recognise Netscape
<br>
browsers (much like Extropy.com's &quot;Decode, debug, etc&quot; page is set up
<br>
but hasn't fixed), so I couldn't download their browser. I sent a nice
<br>
message three times telling them of the bug. Finally I got a response
<br>
about the bug with Media Player saying I needed to download IE 5 and
<br>
reinstall it. It took three more responses for them to figure out that I
<br>
only told them about that bug to make sure they were aware of it, that
<br>
my problem was in downloading IE5. When I told them I couldn't access
<br>
the site with netscape, they said &quot;Why don't you use IE?&quot;
<br>
ARRRRGGGGGHHHHH.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - takes control of Novell printer and then when finished, gives it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other Windows systems first, delaying the Novell printer queue until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all windows systems are done printing
</em><br>
<p>One has to have priorities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - writes invalid HTML code that fails to work in other browsers, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extends Internet Explorer to read the invalid code so it works
</em><br>
<p>Netscape also produces non-standard code as well, they just tell
<br>
everybody about it, so MS programs IE to recognise some of it. Netscape
<br>
refuses to recognise MS non-standard code. Netscape is not innocent
<br>
here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - bought Apple technology to create Windows, and then claimed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Windows 3.0 was not the same Windows they built with Apple source code
</em><br>
<p>no no no. They both stole it from Xerox, as anyone who knows anything
<br>
can tell you. Thats *Xerox* technology you are talking about. Apple is
<br>
as 'innovative' and more monopolizing than MS, just less successful at
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - promised IBM Windows technology for OS/2 including all future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of Windows, but then claimed Windows 95 was not the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Windows.
</em><br>
<p>IBM wanted exclusive marketing, as they had learned their lesson from
<br>
MS-DOS. It wasn't in MS' interest to give them that control (nor ours).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - used open-source Kerberos source code while promising the open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source foundation they will publish their source code, then published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source code but only to people who sign an agreement not to compete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Microsoft
</em><br>
<p>While the GNU license demands you give your improvements away for free.
<br>
Either way, you make no money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - set cheap prices for servers as long as they did not support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Netscape or link to Netscape's site, those that did had to pay much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher prices *retroactively* as a punishment for supporting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition
</em><br>
<p>We run a couple IIS servers and have sold plenty, and have never seen
<br>
this sort of thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - put delays in Excel for Macintosh so it would run slower than Excel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Windows
</em><br>
<p>When a system doesn't have the same math processing, you can either
<br>
create a new engine, or write an interpreter. Which is cheaper?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - gives developers degraded system calls while their internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software developers use better system calls so competitor software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can never work as fast or as well as Microsoft products
</em><br>
<p>No debate here, or for the rest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Java deliberately breaks security rules so that they can add more features
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Java deliberately checked platform so that it would act differently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Windows than other systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - signed agreement  not to change the Java syntax one bit, but then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used tricks to act differently with the same syntax such that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same command would act different for different systems or situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people who dislike Microsoft do so because they support open and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair competition.  The way to win in the market should be to build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better product, not sabotage a competitor's product.  Sometimes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems that Microsoft puts more work into sabotaging other products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than making their product better.
