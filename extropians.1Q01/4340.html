<p><em>&gt;All of which leads to the question of how the kinds of &quot;industrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ecology&quot; values promoted by the group mentioned in Barbara's post
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be fostered in the current political and economic environment. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As regular readers of this list will know, I don't need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;establish my libertarian or free market credentials.  On the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hand, I do have a nostalgia for the fiendishly clever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interconnectedness of the kind of cogen plants we were building in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the early and mid-80s under the Carter laws.  There is no doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the current state of simple market factors aren't creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incentives for this kind of design and construction now; take my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;word for it.  Energy prices don't support the extra effort they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;require.  Presumably, rising energy prices WILL cause such efforts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be undertaken again in the future.  On the other hand, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant advances in photovoltaics and power storage will also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make them  unnecessary.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd be curious to see a discussion here about how free market
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forces can be harnessed to encourage closing industrial cycles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more efficiently and cleanly.
</em><br>
<p>I've been a big advocate of these kinds of ideas ever since I
<br>
started reading Bucky Fuller.
<br>
<p>At a meeting recently I suggested that instead of building turbine
<br>
backup systems on to each of our major facilities in downtown
<br>
Chicago we undertake building a power plant on an unused piece of
<br>
land I spotted across from a CON-ED substation. I figured we could
<br>
cut a deal with the utility for the extra power and get some badly
<br>
needed style points with the city as well.
<br>
<p>They gave me that &quot;What planet are you from&quot; look I sometimes get.
