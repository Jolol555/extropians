<em>&gt; There's another issue that the US is notorious for: inflexible and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example: suppose I smoke a joint in public. Posession of Cannabis, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schedule D controlled substance, is illegal here (in Scotland). Maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence for posession is a £2000 fine (roughly US $3000) for a small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount -- prison sentences for larger quantities. But *in practice*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I smoke a joint in public and a police officer notices, one of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things will happen: they'll ignore it, or they'll take it off me, throw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it down a drain, and formally caution me that if they see me doing it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again they'll charge me. 
</em><br>
<p>SNIP
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, I have a distinct impression that there is *no* facility of leniency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in US law enforcement today. That is, a police officer who turns a blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye to a trivial offense is going to be in fear of their job (at best);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there's a positive requirement that *all* offenses be prosecuted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hilt. This may be a reaction to selective under-enforcement earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on in your history, but from the outside it looks frighteningly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarian. What is justice, without the prerogative of mercy?
</em><br>
<p>Mercy is the job of the judge, generally. A cop will be as tolerant in
<br>
inverse relation to the number of witnesses and how busy he is. If he
<br>
knows you, you might slide with a pot posession in most places. In some
<br>
like San Francisco, cops just ask people to go smoke at home.
<br>
<p>The problem with cops being lenient is that no two cops are equally
<br>
lenient, so common perceptions of the law vary. For example, my
<br>
ex-girlfriend was supposed to have gotten my car inspected for me, which
<br>
she didn't, and I never noticed the sticker had not been updated. 6
<br>
months later I got stopped coming home from camp on Sunday evening by a
<br>
state trooper, was given a ticket, and told to drive the car home and
<br>
get it inspected the next day. The next day I am driving it to the
<br>
garage to be inspected and got pulled over by a town cop who didn't give
<br>
a crap about what the state trooper told me to do, he wrote me up
<br>
another ticket for driving an uninspected vehicle. Explaining the
<br>
situation to the judge gets me off on the second ticket.
