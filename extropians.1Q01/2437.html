<p>Or an indie author, or musician. I can see this getting a lot of support
<br>
at WIPO from the representatives of various unsavoury regimes who have
<br>
state censors -- but I can't see the US or EU getting behind it any
<br>
time soon.
<br>
<p>The real fun with CPRM is that it requires an operating system to
<br>
cooperate with it. If your OS won't play along, CPRM can't work; for
<br>
example, you could write a driver shim for the Linux kernel that would
<br>
simultaneously spool the (plaintext) of a CPRM-protected file to an
<br>
unencrypted location, at the same time as it copies a protected file.
<br>
<p>I don't think the people behind CPRM have realised this yet, and I
<br>
hope they don't for another year or so, but the open source movement
<br>
is fundamentally incompatible with their designs. If Cringley's view
<br>
of the future of hardware is correct (you run it off on your inkjet
<br>
printer) we'll be seeing entire open source laptop and server hardware
<br>
blueprints that you can build at home showing up in a couple of years
<br>
:-) :-)  ... and this means that the stable door is not only un-secured,
<br>
but the horse is well over the horizon and still accelerating.
<br>
<p>I give the copyright totalitarians five years. If their bid for power is
<br>
incomplete by then, they're stuffed.  (On the other hand, if they triumph,
<br>
*we* are stuffed. Combine their copy control mechanisms with the sort of
<br>
omnipresent surveillance society that Jack Straw is pressing for in the UK
<br>
and we will have all the trappings of a corporate-feudalist society,
<br>
combined with police state mechanisms that Stalin would have considered
<br>
extreme.)
