<p><em>&gt; I think we can have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  successful rocket company now.  To paraphrase Adrian, &quot;Go business plan!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Unless I'm very misinformed, all of these small private launch companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  from the 1980s and 1990s tried (or are trying) to make unique, new launch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  vehicles.  Not so much unique in propulsion methods, but just not off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  shelf.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you have to ask, why a NEW rocket company?  The established 
<br>
manufacturers of boosters make a full line of boost capability from very 
<br>
small to pretty darned big (to huge, if you count the STS).  Are there really 
<br>
such inefficiencies in the operations of the existing market players that a 
<br>
new one can make a significant difference in price?  It seems you can't have 
<br>
it both ways: Either you offer a breakthrough in technology and thus 
<br>
significant new efficiencies, or you use the same technology that existing 
<br>
market players do and face the same costs and issues they do.  You have to 
<br>
make a strong case that all of the existing payers in the market suffer from 
<br>
significant organizational inefficiencies unrelated to the technology they 
<br>
employ, or you have to develop and implement a meaningful technological 
<br>
improvement.  What am I missing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  For instance, though I wish Roton all the best and hope their idea works 
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt;  eventually gets to market, when I first saw it, I laughed.  I thought, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you want a recipe for failure, this is it.  A manned launch vehicle that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  relies on a propeller to land.  I was happily surprised when they did their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  test flights.  I like being wrong when I'm pessimistic or cynical, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  still think the idea is a bit too complicated to put into practice right 
</em><br>
now
<br>
<em>&gt;  or even in the near future.
</em><br>
<p>I've reluctantly come to agree.  The test article that Roton demonstrated 
<br>
bears little resemblance to the machine they were planning to fly to orbit: 
<br>
The rotors and rotor head on the test article was essentially nothing like 
<br>
the one that would have had to be complemented for the orbital vehicle.  They 
<br>
may have been able to garner some useful information about low altitude and 
<br>
low speed controls from that first machine, but little else.
<br>
<p>(Note I've corrected the lamentable typo in the subject line.)
