<p>Indeed, and why do we need an implant for an audio/video recording equipment?

We already have wearable display prototypes that are unintrusive (i.e. you're

<p>They can still seize your equipment, thus interrupting the recording process.
<br>
Of course, there might be other wired people in the area, and you might have
<br>
installed such a device (PDA/cellphone hybrids with solid state camera have

been sighted) in line of sight of the scene...
<br>
<p>As to being legally forbidded to record police investigation, I don't have
<br>
to tell, do I? And what can you do about a video/audio sequence published
<br>
on MojoNation/Freenet networks? I can even destroy the publishing key,
<br>
so as long there's demand for this particular bit of multimedia, it can't
<br>
be destroyed safe of pulling the entire Internet down. And I can't spill the
<br>
key, since I no longer have it.
