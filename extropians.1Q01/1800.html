</em><br>
<p>When you look at the HTML that word generates you will notice that it does things in a very strange way.
<br>
<p>Where I work I have had issues with pages created from word documents crashing netscape browsers, and older versions of any browser.
<br>
<p>Many older browsers do not handle the font styles that word likes to use.
<br>
<p>My first recommendation use a non microsoft html editor (both frontpage, and any office product do things in a very complex way)  My favorite is Homesite, I also use notepad and I am still a Windows flunky.
<br>
<p>Second, code straight HTML from the 4.0 standards (you can find the standards at www.w3c.com) and just copy and paste the text from word rather than save it as n HTML document.  Another Strange thing that I have noticed about Word conversion when veiwed in a netscape browser 4.0 and lower is that Word does not alway close tags in the revers order that it creates them and Netscape gets confused resulting in ugly web pages.
<br>
<p>example: &quot;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; random junk &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/U&gt;more random junk&quot; would often result in the rest of the Web page appearing in bold, underline, or both.  THis issue was resolved by re-writing the HTML to &quot; &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; random junk &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;more random junk, closing the tags in the reverse order that they were created.
<br>
<p>btw, your web page did not crash my browser
