<em>&gt; I said I thought I knew how to do it.  I didn't say I had written it down,

<em>&gt; produced an architectural sketch and incremental developmental pathway,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obtained funding, hired a group of highly intelligent engineers, and

<em>&gt; CaTAI 2.2 with the earlier sections.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As I said, I am an engineer.  Good theorie and ideas and intuitions are
<br>
wonderful.  But at some point we have to go to writing it down and
<br>
having more eyeballs and heads mull it over and thinking about how to
<br>
actually lay the project out. This doesn't require design by committee
<br>
but it does require fairly thorough design and early inplementation and
<br>
experiment looping back to design.  I know it takes time.  Let me know
<br>
if I can be of assistance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, if you think it's a good idea, write it up and send it in to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local journal.  I'm not making a career out of that argument, any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I made a career out of the 10^17 ops/sec @ 2025 estimate for human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalence.  I just have the responsibility of picking what seems like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best argument and making my best guess using it, whether peer-reviewed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, you are betting your strategy on such arguments and as you say
<br>
the stakes are really high, the highest imaginable.  So it is quite
<br>
important to get these things on paper and turned inside out and
<br>
sideways my as many competent eyes as possible to get the maximum
<br>
confidence and understanding going forward.  The responsibility is NOT
<br>
yours alone and your best guesses alone are not likely to suffice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So exactly what is being done to produce the SI beyond the papers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such?  How do people get involved if interested and possessing needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; talents or desiring to invest?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Events occur in the following sequence:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)   We receive tax-exempt status from the IRS.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)   The AI project is put into initiable form (i.e., design moved down to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a level low enough that highly intelligent engineers can start work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  See previous comment about comparing &quot;Time and Linearity&quot; versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;CaTAI 1.0&quot;.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3a)  We obtain funding (private foundations or individuals) to hire some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of highly intelligent engineers;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3b)  We find highly intelligent engineers who are willing to be hired;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)   Engineers are hired and work starts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Cool.  But while (1) is being waited on and (2) is moving apace, it sure
<br>
seems like some planning/ordering steps of development and noting
<br>
dependencies and stuff would give a running start to (4) and also
<br>
provide critical sizing estimates for (3a,b).  I am curious about (2),
<br>
in what form and to what degree do you see  the design &quot;moved down to a
<br>
level low enough&quot; being acheived?
