<p>Guns are a luxury in this situation, relative to food, air, and water.
<br>
Once you land, you have some - unknown - amount of time before you have
<br>
to defend yourself.  If you knew when the invaders would come and how
<br>
much firepower you would need to be rid of them, it would be most
<br>
profitable to wait as long as possible before making the guns, and then
<br>
only divert just enough of your resources to make the guns in time.
<br>
You don't have this knowledge, though, so you must guess - and the
<br>
better your guess (in terms of being able to defend yourself while
<br>
taking as little away from possible from your colony building), the
<br>
better off you'll be.  Conversely, build nothing but guns, and you're
<br>
dead before the invaders even think you might be worth harassing.
<br>
<p>Pluswhich, I'd rather take out the unwanted troops while they're still
<br>
in their transport.  A rocket to shatter their vehicle, or at least
<br>
push it off course until it runs out of fuel, is so much cleaner and
<br>
safer than letting them get anywhere near their weapons' range.
