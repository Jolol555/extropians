<br>
<p>, so the

<em>&gt; fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution can't explain it either is no proof the

<em>&gt; idea is wrong.
</em><br>
<p>**So far as I'm aware it doesn't attempt to explain
<br>
it.

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt;     &gt;the Bible is a botched and condensed

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;three times removed from the original Sumerian

<em>&gt; texts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you seriously trying to tell us that if we did

<em>&gt; original Sumerian texts we'd know more science today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today? 
</em><br>
<p>**No--I'm seriously saying creationists aren't even
<br>
basing their argument on the proper texts, i.e.--the
<br>
texts they believe unaltered-since-inception are not
<br>
even original. Thus a rational mind cannot support
<br>
their assertions; they don't know what they're talking
<br>
about--scientifically OR religiously.
<br>
<p>Are you saying they'd be more important than
<br>
<em>&gt; Mother Goose?
</em><br>
<p>**Absolutely. And, btw, some of them are still around.
<br>
Not in good shape, mind you--but still around.

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Einstein was not trained as a physicist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My, that's rather a foolish thing to say now isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>**Einstein is generally acknowledged to have been,
<br>
primarily, a mathematician. He had little professional
<br>
contact or acces to the literature of physics and was
<br>
quite young and working in a patent office while
<br>
working out his early theories--including special
<br>
relativity (1905). It was after this that he became
<br>
widely recognized and also a professor of, yes,
<br>
physics at the University of Zurich--in 1909, years
<br>
after the breakthrough (at which point his abilities 
<br>
and their relevance to the field of physics could not
<br>
be denied). He was, however, teaching (high
<br>
school)mathematics in 1901, but could not get into a
<br>
university(!) Mathematician Marcel Grossman's father
<br>
got him a job in the patent office because no
<br>
university would have him.
<br>
<p>**If you'll look back, my point was that the biggest
<br>
breakthroughs often come from those outside the fields
<br>
affected by the breakthroughs. Einstein had some early
<br>
schooling in mathematics and physics, but he was
<br>
almost completely unknown in the physics community; an
<br>
outsider; a man who could not find a university
<br>
post--a mathematician.
