The anti-evolutionists argued that no missing links, or intermediate forms,
<br>
between species have ever been found. Now they have.

<br>
<p>Darwin's Missing Evidence On Speciation Finally Found
<br>
<p>Biologists at the University of California, San Diego have demonstrated, in
<br>
a study of the songs and genetics of a series of interbreeding populations
<br>
of warblers in central Asia, how one species can diverge into two.
<br>
<p>Their description of the intermediate forms of two reproductively isolated
<br>
populations of songbirds that no longer interbreed is the &quot;missing evidence&quot;
<br>
that Darwin had hoped to use to support his theory of natural selection, but
<br>
was never able to find.
<br>
<p>&quot;One of the largest mysteries remaining in evolutionary biology is exactly
<br>
how one species can gradually diverge into two,&quot; says Darren E. Irwin, a
<br>
biologist at UCSD who headed the study, detailed in today's issue of the
<br>
journal Nature.
<br>
&quot;This process, known as speciation, is very difficult to study because it
<br>
can take a great deal of time to occur.&quot;
<br>
Biologists have generally learned about the divergence of species by
<br>
comparing many different species at various stages of speciation. But in
<br>
their study of the greenish warbler, a songbird that breeds in forests
<br>
throughout much of temperate Asia, Irwin and his colleagues -- Trevor D.
<br>
Price, a biology professor at UCSD, and Staffan Bensch, a former
<br>
postdoctoral student at UCSD now at Sweden's Lund University -- discovered a
<br>
rare situation known to biologists as a &quot;ring species.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Ring species are unique because they present all levels of variation, from
<br>
small differences between neighboring populations to species-level
<br>
differences, in a single group of organisms,&quot; says Irwin, a former student
<br>
of Price who is in the process of beginning his postdoctoral work with
<br>
Bensch at Lund University.
<br>
In the case of the greenish warbler, Phylloscopus trochiloides, the
<br>
scientists discovered a continuous ring of populations with gradually
<br>
changing behavioral and genetic characteristics encircling the Tibetan
<br>
Plateau, which is treeless and uninhabitable.
<br>
This ring is broken by a species boundary at only one place, in central
<br>
Siberia, where two forms of the songbird coexist without interbreeding.
<br>
&quot;This creates a paradox in which the two co-existing forms can be considered
<br>
as two species and as a single species at the same time,&quot; says Irwin. &quot;Such
<br>
ring species are extremely rare, but they are valuable because they can show
<br>
all of the intermediate steps that occurred during the divergence of one
<br>
species into two.&quot;
<br>
<p>In their paper, the scientists show how they discovered a gradual variation
<br>
in the song patterns, morphology and genetic markers of 15 populations of
<br>
the greenish warbler.
<br>
At each end of the ring of interbreeding populations, which extend around
<br>
each side of the Tibetan plateau and through the Himalayas, the scientists
<br>
found that the two distinct, non-interbreeding forms of the bird do not
<br>
recognize each other's songs, which are critical in the selection of their
<br>
mates. They determined this from experiments in which they played recordings
<br>
of male greenish warbler songs and judged the response of other birds in the
<br>
trees.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the greenish warbler, as in most songbirds, males sing to attract mates
<br>
and to defend territories,&quot; says Irwin. &quot;The greenish warblers living in the
<br>
Himalayas sing songs that are simple, short and repetitive.
<br>
&quot;As you go north along the western side of Tibet, moving through central
<br>
Asia, the songs gradually become longer and more complex.
<br>
&quot;On the eastern side of the ring, moving northwards through China, songs
<br>
also become longer and more complex, but the structure is different than on
<br>
the western side.
<br>
&quot;Where the birds meet in Siberia, their songs are so different that they do
<br>
not recognize each other as mates or competitors. They act like separate
<br>
species, and the genetic evidence supports that conclusion.
<br>
<p>&quot;Apparently, as the birds moved north along two pathways into the forests of
<br>
Siberia, their songs became longer and more complex, perhaps because females
<br>
in the north rely more strongly on song when choosing a mate. But the forms
<br>
of complexity differed between west and east Siberia, because there are more
<br>
ways to be complex than simple.
<br>
&quot;The greenish warbler is the first case in which we can see all the steps
<br>
that occurred in the behavioral divergence of two species from their common
<br>
ancestor. These results demonstrate how small evolutionary changes can lead
<br>
to the differences that cause reproductive isolation between species, just
<br>
as Darwin envisioned.&quot;
<br>
The study was financed in part by the National Science Foundation and the
<br>
National Geographic Society. - By Kim McDonald
