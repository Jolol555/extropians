Press Enter did not involve displaying any patterns, it was some kind
<br>
of message or noise received over the phone lines that caused people to
<br>
commit suicide.
<br>
<p>The story this reminded me of was &quot;The Riddle of the Universe and Its
<br>
Solution&quot;, by Christopher Cherniak, presented in chapter 12 of The Mind's
<br>
I by Hofstadter and Dennett.  The story was from 1978.
<br>
<p>The idea is that there is some thought, some sentence, which puts the
<br>
brain into an infinite loop from which it never exits.  People fall into
<br>
a coma and are completely unresponsive to stimuli.
<br>
<p>The sentence can be deduced from current research into AI and cognitive
<br>
science.  The first researcher is hit, then someone who is going over
<br>
his work is hit, and later when others view the research, they succumb
<br>
as well.  Typically the last word of victims is &quot;Aha!&quot;.  A student views
<br>
the work but doesn't understand it; they are adivsed to learn as little
<br>
additional as possible about AI.
<br>
<p>Of course there was also the Monty Python skit about a joke so funny
<br>
you would die of laughter if you ever heard it...
<br>
