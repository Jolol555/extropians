<br>
<p>The Sound of One Cell Growing
<br>
<p>Researchers think they can build a &quot;nanomicrophone&quot;
<br>
based on tiny hairs -- rather than a membrane -- that
<br>
could hear such a thing
<br>
<p>Edited by Douglas Harbrecht
<br>
<p><p>The search for a new method of detecting life on
<br>
distant planets may have led to the invention of the
<br>
smallest and most sensitive microphone ever devised.
<br>
Indeed, the tiny sensor may permit researchers to
<br>
listen to the sound of a swimming bacterium or hear the
<br>
gurgling of fluids inside living cells. &quot;There's a
<br>
whole world buzzing down there,&quot; observes Flavio Noca,
<br>
who heads the research effort at Jet Propulsion
<br>
Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif. &quot;Movement is one
<br>
of the signatures for life.&quot;
<br>
<p>The design of the new sensor, developed in conjuction
<br>
with NASA, borrows from biology. Unlike all acoustical
<br>
microphones in use today, the device doesn't rely on a
<br>
drum-like membrane to capture sound waves. Instead, it
<br>
mimics the field of tiny hairs, called stereocilia,
<br>
that line the inner ear and transmit sound to the
<br>
brain. Noca's artificial ear is constructed from arrays
<br>
of nanoscale tubes of carbon, so small they're measured
<br>
on the scale of billionths of a meter. Like cilia, the
<br>
tiny filaments bend in response to the slightest change
<br>
in pressure.
<br>
<p>Alan Hall, science and technology correspondent for
<br>
Business Week Online, recently asked researcher Noca
<br>
about the invention and its eventual uses. Here are
<br>
edited excerpts of their conversation:
<br>
<p>Q: How did the idea of artificial stereocilia come
<br>
about?
<br>
A: At the beginning of last year, JPL set for itself
<br>
the grand challenge of determining whether it would be
<br>
possible to detect signatures of life on other planets,
<br>
and a solicitation for proposals was released
<br>
internally. The requirements on the device were
<br>
stringent because it had to be placed on a spacecraft
<br>
-- power, size, and weight are strong limitations.
<br>
<p>A colleague, Michael Hoenk, and I thought that a
<br>
universal signature of life is movement -- even at the
<br>
molecular level -- and being able to sense such
<br>
activity could provide some answers. By working out the
<br>
numbers, I found that flat acoustic membranes would
<br>
never do the job of sensing nanoscale movement. That's
<br>
how I came up with the idea of using protruding rods
<br>
for detecting movement in mid-May, 1999. I approached
<br>
some professors at Caltech studying swimming micro-
<br>
organisms, and they agreed that this was a &quot;cute&quot; idea.
<br>
<p>Q: How did you arrive at carbon nanotubes?
<br>
A: Quite by accident. Our group supervisor, Brian Hunt,
<br>
was about to start a nanotechnology effort at JPL and
<br>
had been in contact with Professor Jimmy Xu, who's now
<br>
at Brown University. Xu told him that he had just been
<br>
able to manufacture perfectly ordered nanotube arrays.
<br>
These nanoscale rods protruding from a surface were
<br>
just what we needed for our sensors.
<br>
<p>It was only in the next few days, by early June, 1999,
<br>
that I realized that these nanorod arrays already
<br>
existed in nature in the form of stereocilia. I was
<br>
even more surprised to find out that cilia are to be
<br>
found almost everywhere. Until then, human technology
<br>
was just not capable of reproducing such small gadgets.
<br>
With these nanotube arrays, the artificial stereocilia
<br>
were about to become reality.
<br>
<p>Q: Membranes seem pretty common in nature -- our ear
<br>
drums, for example. Why not just make them smaller?
<br>
A: Most of our competitors are trying to do just that.
<br>
Several research groups are attempting to make arrays
<br>
of micromembranes and assemble them on a single silicon
<br>
wafer. The U.S. Navy wants such a chip so that it can
<br>
make acoustic cameras for divers to detect mines in
<br>
turbid water and at night. A membrane-based approach to
<br>
directional sensing of sound waves is being developed
<br>
by Lucent Technologies. This group recently
<br>
demonstrated a tent-shaped sensor with a membrane on
<br>
each of the four facets.
<br>
<p>Q: Then what makes artificial stereocilia superior?
<br>
A: The miniaturization of conventional acoustic sensors
<br>
is limited by the increasing stiffness of membranes as
<br>
the size is reduced. In nature, membranes are present
<br>
only as coupling devices between the acoustic
<br>
environment and the zone, typically the cochlea, where
<br>
the signal is picked up by stereocilia. Nature has
<br>
evolved toward this solution, probably because of the
<br>
unique properties of stereocilia at very small scales.
<br>
This is consistent with the absence of microscale
<br>
tympanic membranes in living systems.
<br>
<p>Our project is motivated by the observation that
<br>
conventional approaches to acoustics cannot duplicate
<br>
the unique properties of biological hearing organs.
<br>
Moreover, the nanotube arrays are simple and cheap to
<br>
make, and can be assembled into large and dense arrays.
<br>
<p>Q: You said stereocilia were &quot;found almost everywhere&quot;
<br>
in nature. Where, for example?
<br>
A: Stereocilia are found in the cochlea of all hearing
<br>
animals. They're also present in the vestibular -- or
<br>
balance -- system of animals, from our inner ear to
<br>
lobsters. Stereocilia populate the lateral-line system
<br>
of fish for the measurement of water flows along the
<br>
animal body and, presumably, also for identifying the
<br>
direction of sound sources. Even nonhearing organisms,
<br>
such as hydra, jellyfish, and sea anemones, rely on
<br>
stereocilia to detect swimming prey.
<br>
<p>Q: Then why are scientists just now looking at
<br>
stereocilia as a model for acoustic sensors?
<br>
A: The idea of membranes was also taken from nature,
<br>
and today they're universally used as acoustic
<br>
transducers in microphones. But it is stereocilia that
<br>
do the real work. They weren't considered because the
<br>
technological basis for making ordered arrays of
<br>
nanometer-scale carbon nanotubes did not exist until
<br>
recently. Our proposal represents the first viable
<br>
technological alternative to membranes.
<br>
<p>Q: What makes stereocilia unique?
<br>
A: The nanometer-scale diameter of stereocilia provides
<br>
extreme sensitivity to small signals. Natural
<br>
stereocilia have the capability of sensing signals
<br>
below the natural movement of molecules. Unlike current
<br>
microphones, stereocilia are directional -- the tubes
<br>
always bend away from the source of sound. Also, among
<br>
our surprising results is a calculation showing the
<br>
feasibility of using artificial stereocilia in an air
<br>
environment in contrast to biological stereocilia,
<br>
which are always found in liquids.
<br>
<p>Q: Where do you foresee early applications?
<br>
A: It's likely that nanotube-based acoustic sensors
<br>
will first find their way into hearing-aid technology,
<br>
especially because of their directional sensitivity.
<br>
Humans rely on two separated ears to detect the
<br>
direction of a sound source. Directional sensitivity is
<br>
important for being able to pick up conversations in a
<br>
crowded room. You want to hear the person in front of
<br>
you and not all the chat going on around you. The
<br>
military obviously has a keen interest in this
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>Q: Are there other military possibilities?
<br>
A: One is imitating fish's lateral lines, which are
<br>
long canals coated with stereocilia on the side of
<br>
animal. We think that fish use these for prey
<br>
detection, localization, and identification, and also
<br>
as flow-control devices. In the past few years, there
<br>
has been an incentive to develop autonomous swimming
<br>
robots, so sensors for flow control would be very
<br>
useful. It's still not well understood how fish detect
<br>
prey with lateral lines, but the Navy would be very
<br>
interested in having a similar device to detect foreign
<br>
objects in the ocean in a passive way.
<br>
<p>Q: What about medicine?
<br>
A: A nanoscale &quot;acoustic&quot; sensor will capture the
<br>
frequencies of chemical and metabolic events occurring
<br>
within a cell. Some time in the future, we can envision
<br>
these &quot;nanostethoscopes&quot; floating in the bloodstream
<br>
and body fluids and listening passively to biochemical
<br>
events occurring in the body.
<br>
<p>For instance, it's known that the intracellular
<br>
activity of cancerous cells tends to be much higher
<br>
than for healthy cells. A nanoexplorer loaded with a
<br>
nanostethoscope could probably &quot;hear&quot; such cells. It
<br>
may one day be possible to detect tumors when only a
<br>
few cells are cancerous.
<br>
<p>Q: Have you considered founding a startup company?
<br>
A: Many venture capitalists have shown interest.
<br>
Because of JPL ethics regulations, we're not allowed to
<br>
own a startup while being a member of the JPL
<br>
community. The license is owned by the California
<br>
Institute of Technology since we're Caltech employees.
<br>
However, Caltech does offer priorities to the Caltech
<br>
inventors when giving out licenses. We're waiting for
<br>
the project to become more mature before thinking of
<br>
venturing in the real world.
<br>
<p>Q. What's your immediate goal?
<br>
A: Develop an actual working device and prove that it
<br>
satisfies all expectations.
<br>
<p>Aumentar!
<br>
Onward,
