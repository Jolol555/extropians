John Marlow, responding to Mike Lorrey said:
<br>
<p>&quot;True enough. However--I said &quot;shot,&quot; he said &quot;killed.&quot; The vast 
<br>
majority of cops shot are, fortunately, not killed.&quot;
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>jm
<br>
<p>Granted, the 1998 FBI UCR does not specifically track officers shot but not
<br>
killed.
<br>
However, if you refer to page 31 of the reference document (URL below) &quot;Law
<br>
enforcement Officers Feloniously Killed and Assaulted&quot; I think we can safely
<br>
infer that being shot and living counts as a felonious assault, yes? (Can
<br>
any legal type comment or rebut that?)
<br>
You will see that of the 623,887 assaults on law enforcement
<br>
officers(remember that includes federal agents as well) only 9.4% ocurred at
<br>
a traffic stop. The highest category for assaults, but not killings, is
<br>
disturbance calls at 31.8%
<br>
<p>[Question for a lawyer: Is shooting someone (not accidentally) automatically
<br>
attempted murder?]
<br>
<p>So we can conclude, based on this publically available data, that MOST cops
<br>
are NOT shot at traffic stops nor are MOST cops killed at traffic stops.
<br>
About 1/3rd of cops killed are killed attempting to arrest someone.  The
<br>
single greatest source of Officer Assaults (on them) is while responding to
<br>
a disturbance call. (admittedly a very broad category and there is a good
<br>
case to argue that many &quot;disturbace calls&quot; turn into an &quot;arrest situation&quot;)
<br>
I would therefore submit that Mr. Marlow is incorrect in his original
<br>
assertions, but may have a point that #1, the way the numbers are broken
<br>
down does not tell the whole story and #2, that certain subsets of &quot;Law
<br>
Enforcement Officers&quot; (the California Highway Patrol comes to mind) may
<br>
indeed have dramatically different numbers than the aggregate totals shown
<br>
in the cited reference.
