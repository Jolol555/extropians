<em>&gt;              Time Arrow(s)

<p><p>I wrote the following some years ago to the sci.astro newsgroup. I thought
<br>
that some people here might be interested in seeing a repost to this

list, since Prigogine's work is relevant to the topic of Time's Arrows.

<p><em>&gt;Could anyone tell me in layman terms what he discovered? Apparently he's

<em>&gt;come up with a way to combine statistical and Newtonian physics, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irreversible systems now can be reversed (ie friction and time's arrow)
</em><br>
<p>Prigogine won the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his work in the
<br>
thermodynamics of nonequilibrium systems.
<br>
<p>Prigogine is primarily a chemist. He was well established in his field
<br>
20 years ago, so what he's done since then, is branch out into related
<br>
areas.  As I understand it, his main discovery has been the discovery
<br>
of &quot;chemical clocks.&quot; These are chemical reactions that oscillate in a
<br>
very regular and precise way. Prigogine predicted that they should
<br>
exist from a theoretical chemistry standpoint several decades ago.  In
<br>
the late 1950's, one of his research group came back from a visit with
<br>
a colleague in Russia, announcing that they had a chemical reaction
<br>
that did just what Prigogine predicted. The reaction is now known as
<br>
the Belousov-Zhabotininskii reaction and it is the oxidation of citric
<br>
acid by potassium bromate catalyzed by the ceric-cerous ion couple.
<br>
<p>To Prigogine, irreversibility is a fundamental property of
<br>
physics. Prigogine proposes that entropy production is part of an
<br>
operator (operators map functions onto functions), and time is an
<br>
operator. And that the time that we are all familiar with from
<br>
classical mechanics is just an ensemble average of this operator with
<br>
a state vector. I.e. &quot;ordinary&quot; time is an average over his new
<br>
time operator. And that &quot;age&quot; is DEpendent of the distibution.
<br>
<p>So what does that mean about operators..?  Let's say that we wish to
<br>
know the time evolution of a system. In both quantum mechanics and
<br>
classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian operator determines how the
<br>
system will evolve in time. The evolution that we are all familiar
<br>
with is a reversible and deterministic evolution (We can say that the
<br>
reversible change of a wave function that represents the quantum
<br>
system corresponds to a reversible motion along a trajectory that
<br>
represents the classical system.) The wave function or trajectory
<br>
represents the maximum knowledge of the system.
<br>
<p>Prigogine has incorporated reversible and irreversible parts into a
<br>
new microscopic equation/description. The equation contains an
<br>
operator analogous to the Hamiltonian, that is a new &quot;time evolution
<br>
operator&quot; that now can drive the system to both equilibrium or
<br>
nonequilibrium states. Entropy is produced by the even part of the new
<br>
time evolution operator and he has defined an operator for that.
<br>
<p>An example that Prigogine gives looks at the conventional and his
<br>
unconventional determination of energy levels in a quantum system. In
<br>
the conventional quantum mechanics, both the energy levels and the
<br>
time evolution of them are determined by the same quantity: the
<br>
Hamiltonian operator. Prigogine's method allows him to use two
<br>
different operators: the time operator for time evolution and another
<br>
operator (a &quot;superoperator&quot; that can act on other operators) to
<br>
determine the energy levels. So in this way, instead of having the
<br>
&quot;particle&quot; and the &quot;interaction&quot; (conventional view), we have the
<br>
physical _process_ that contains electrons, photons, etc. that drive
<br>
the total system. This process is &quot;real&quot; and cannot be &quot;transformed&quot;
<br>
away by any change of representation.
<br>
<p>Or another way to look at it: the classical order says particles come
<br>
first and the Second Law of Thermodynamics comes later, while
<br>
Prigogine says that we must _first_ introduce the Second Law before
<br>
being able to define the entities.
<br>
<p>Another one of Prigigine's main themes is that nonlinear interactions
<br>
frequently lead to order (which he calls &quot;dissipative structures&quot;)
<br>
through fluctuations. A dissipative structure is order visible on a
<br>
macroscale which can exchange energy with the outside world. In
<br>
particular, if the system is in a far-from-equilibrium-state this can
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>In fact, in Prigogine's view, we can now recognize ourselves as a kind
<br>
of evolved form of dissipative structure, and we can justify, in an
<br>
objective way, the distinction between the future and the past. How?
<br>
The time symmetry is broken in the following way: the existence of
<br>
irreversible processes on the microscopic level through kinetic
<br>
equations violates the symmetry of the canonical equations. And
<br>
dissipative structures may, in turn, break the symmetries of
<br>
space-time.
<br>
<p>I don't know if I managed to put this in layman's terms. His theory is
<br>
very mathematical. But I think this is cool stuff.
<br>
<p>You can find out more about Prigogine's ideas in the books: _Order Out
<br>
of Chaos_ (few or no equations) and _From Being to Becoming_ (very
<br>
technical, but the same subject matter).
