want

<p>This is perhaps true in the US. Here in New Zealand (and probably in
<br>
Australia too, which is where Emlyn appears to be from, judging from her
<br>
email address) MS has an inordinately large share of the market.  I think
<br>
this is partly due to the fact that NZ and AUS companies are much smaller
<br>
than US companies and consequently don't need the scalability offered by
<br>
Oracle, Sun etc.  Piracy is perhaps also more prevalent here (though I have
<br>
no figures on this).
<br>
<p>I've typically found strong management resistance to non-MS solutions,
<br>
though this is reducing - after all, what management team can argue with
<br>
freely available open-source office suites, web-servers, and databases!
