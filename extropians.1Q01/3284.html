Most all of my black friends (or African Americans if you prefer) live with
<br>
being pulled over quite often.  I think it even gets to the point where they
<br>
feel that it's just something you have to deal with and they expect it.  One
<br>
such friend was astonished when I told him I'd only ever been pulled over
<br>
once.  He get's pulled over quite a lot, as does his parents, friends, etc.
<br>
And these are all middle to upper class people.  They just happen to have
<br>
the wrong skin color.
