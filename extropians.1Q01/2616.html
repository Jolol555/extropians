<p>That's why I've got the (big, colourful) radiation symbol on the back.
<br>
Better have it on the front, too.

<p>While wondering idly about an idea for a story in recent times, this idea
<br>
came up as a cult-like group of warped pacifists; they wear yellow rubber
<br>
suits, ww1 style gas masks, backpack nuke, big black rad symbols front and
<br>
back. No one bothers them.
