|&gt; &gt;3) there is no evidence that being incarcerated for a length of
<br>
|&gt; &gt;time is a useful deterrent or actually rehabilitates. There is
<br>
|&gt; &gt;considerable evidence that the cost to society is largely
<br>
|&gt; &gt;unjustified.
<br>
|&gt; 
<br>
|&gt; Ah, deterrence rears it's ugly head. The incarceration is primarily
<br>
|&gt; for punishment not deterrence, although proper punishment should
<br>
|&gt; have a deterring effect. The main idea of incarceration is to place
<br>
|&gt; them in a controlled, monitored enviroment where they can be
<br>
|&gt; prevented from commiting any further criminal acts.
<br>
|&gt;

<br>
<p>The prison industry gives work to a large number of people, esp. in
<br>
countries with a large prison population. In their view, rehabilitation
<br>
might equal unemployment. Considering the excellent track record of using
<br>
certain chemical compunds to reprogram the human biocomputer in convicts,
<br>
I find it remarkable that these results have totally been ignored by most
<br>
correctional departments. This suggests to me that the traditional prison
<br>
paradigm, with its labour-intensive methodology, mainly thrives on the public
<br>
outcry for revenge on criminals, so well acted on by votes-hungry politruks,
<br>
and on the conservative impetus of the nomenklatura, the prison industry
<br>
people in this case, who do not want any changes of their livelihood. The
<br>
fact that in most countries private companies do not own prisons might also
<br>
have an impact (state ownership = ineffectual enterprise).
<br>
<p>Any questions? :)
