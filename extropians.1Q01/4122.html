I picked up a copy of this book today:
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609607995/qid=982465065/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/105-2144092-2777523">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609607995/qid=982465065/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/105-2144092-2777523</a>
<br>
It was published last Monday, Feb. 12.  A passage from the Introduction (pp. 10-12):
<br>
<p>&quot;I was haunted by a question whose answer had long eluded historians.
<br>
The Germans always had the lists of Jewish names...  But how did the
<br>
Nazis get the lists?  For decades, no one has known.  Few have asked...
<br>
<p>I confronted the reality of IBM's involvement one day in 1993 in Washington
<br>
at the United States Holocaust Museum.  There, in the very first exhibit,
<br>
an IBM Hollerith D-11 card sorting machine... was permanently displayed.
<br>
Clearly affixed to the machine's front panel glistened an IBM nameplate...
<br>
[A]lthough 15 million people, including most major Holocaust experts, have
<br>
seen the display, and in spite of the best efforts of leading Museum historians,
<br>
little more was understood about the provocative display other than the brief
<br>
curator's description at the exhibit and a few pages of supportive research...
<br>
<p>My parents are Holocaust survivors, uprooted from their homes in Poland.
<br>
My mother escaped from a boxcar en route to Treblinka, was shot, and then
<br>
buried in a shallow mass grave.  My father had already run away from a
<br>
guarded line of Jews and discovered her leg protruding from the snow...
<br>
Standing next to me five decades later, their image within the reflection
<br>
of the exhibit glass,... my parents could only express confusion...
<br>
But I had other questions.  The Nazis had my parents' names.  How?
<br>
What was the connection of this gleaming black, beige, and silver machine,
<br>
squatting silently in this dimly lit museum, to the millions of Jews
<br>
and other Europeans who were murdered...?&quot;
<br>
<p>There is a copy of an article from last Sunday's London _Times_ in
<br>
the Usenet article at:
<br>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22IBM+and+the+Holocaust%22&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&rnum=7&seld=921645305&ic=1">http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22IBM+and+the+Holocaust%22&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&rnum=7&seld=921645305&ic=1</a>
<br>
<p>I anticipate that this book will be a depressing document to read -- a
<br>
sobering demonstration that the computer technology celebrated by nearly
<br>
everyone on this list was tainted even before its birth by the sordid
<br>
use to which it was put by the Nazis, from which, this author alleges,
<br>
IBM profited handsomely.
<br>
<p>I had a conversation with a friend recently in which the friend remarked
<br>
that citizens of the Western democracies at the end of the 20th century
<br>
probably enjoy more freedom than has existed before in the history of the
<br>
human race.  I agreed with this, but added that the technology which
<br>
we enjoy so much is at the same time creating an infrastructure which could
<br>
someday support the most oppressive and inescapable tyranny yet seen.
<br>
<p>By the way, I first heard of this book last weekend when I caught
<br>
the tail end of a news broadcast on TechTV.  I probably would not have
<br>
had the stomach to submit that &quot;Das blinkenlights...&quot; article from
<br>
the previous weekend if I had known about this book beforehand
<br>
(the juxtaposition of the news of the book's publication with the title
<br>
and subject matter of my article in a public mailing list would in any
<br>
case have been in extremely bad taste).  It seems we live in a world
<br>
in which no pleasure can be guaranteed to be totally innocent.
<br>
