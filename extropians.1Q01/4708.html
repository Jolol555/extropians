</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Air, Fire, Earth, and Water.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The context I've considered is that the symbols of these four
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elements have a very _old_ place (many thousands of years) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans' lives and these four elements are still used today. In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientific sense, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire are not bad symbols
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the four states of matter -- solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
</em><br>
<p>This is an obvious interpretation, except that I prefer to use energy 
<br>
instead of plasma.  The ancients didn't know about plasma.  Their 
<br>
fire included heat and light, and sometimes lightning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm intrigued by the widespread use of these symbols. As metaphors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The fact that they've been successfully in use for thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years, makes me wonder why our brains appear to have a preference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for organizing or categorizing the world with these elements.
</em><br>
<p>I'm don't think our brains have a preference for these four elements. 
<br>
The Ayurveda  system has three elements.  The Chinese had five 
<br>
elements.  The Greek had four and later five elements.  Some American 
<br>
Indian systems had six elements.  There does not seem to be a 
<br>
universal tie with the four elements that you list.  Ancient 
<br>
proto-scientists merely classified matter into the different types 
<br>
that they perceived.  Remember that the Eskimos have many more 
<br>
classifications of ice and snow than most cultures.
<br>
<p>Air includes all known vapors and gasses.  To the ancients, all of 
<br>
these were detected by smelling or seeing these substances in the 
<br>
air.  They never saw gasses that were not mixed with air.
<br>
<p>Fire was pretty much the only energy source they recognized.  It 
<br>
included heat and light.  They therefore interpreted body heat as a 
<br>
form of fire in the body.  They saw the sun as being made of fire. 
<br>
They even interpreted lightning as a form of fire.  It obviously had 
<br>
light, and where it struck ground it left charred remains or started 
<br>
a fire.
<br>
<p>Earth includes all ancient solids.  The ground was solid.  Stones 
<br>
were dug up from the ground.  Metal was mined from the ground. 
<br>
Crystals were mined from the earth.  Even wood grew out of the 
<br>
ground.  The ancients even interpreted humans as being made from the 
<br>
earth and returning to the earth.  Given the growth of tadpoles in 
<br>
mud and the common belief in biogenesis, they literally though 
<br>
animals grew out of the ground.
<br>
<p>Water includes all ancient liquids.  Except for oils, all of the 
<br>
ancient liquids were water-based.  They could easily distill water 
<br>
out of these liquids.  Therefore assigning all liquids as water made 
<br>
sense.  (They interpreted oil as being a mixture of fire and water, 
<br>
or burning-water.)
<br>
<p>These four classification of everything in the universe down to four 
<br>
types of matter seems to be more reality-based than psychology-based. 
<br>
Simple observation showed four types of matter that behaved 
<br>
differently from each other.  There is no need to interpret mystical 
<br>
reasons for the choice of these four elements.  I suspect that the 
<br>
reality is the reverse.  If the physical world is made up of four 
<br>
states of matter, they might have corresponding states in religious, 
<br>
philosophical or psychological thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I suppose the line of thinking that first led me to this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Aristotle's teleology, and then I kept noticing these four elements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having a large role in a number of religious, holistic, occultic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new-age practices today.
</em><br>
<p>The roots of religion, occult and science all derived from the more 
<br>
primitive knowledge that was available in ancient times.  There is 
<br>
nothing special about the fact that all history traces back to a 
<br>
smaller subset of knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Here are some of the places I've seen the Four Elements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ASTROLOGY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;OCCULTISTS/TAROT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Kabbalah-ists' perspective, in addition, is that the Universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WICCANS/PAGANS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AYURVEDA
</em><br>
<p>Except for the Ayurveda system, most of what you describe is derived 
<br>
from the Golden Dawn system of magic.  This system of magic tried to 
<br>
coordinate these other systems into a coherent whole.  Although the 
<br>
system is based on the historical understanding of these different 
<br>
beliefs, it also retroactively determined correspondences between 
<br>
these systems.  This modern reorganization and reinterpretation of 
<br>
the other systems has since influenced these other systems during the 
<br>
last century.  This gives the impression that all ancient systems are 
<br>
very much synchronized.  Research into the ancient versions of these 
<br>
systems will show them in a much more primitive state and much less 
<br>
synchronized than they appear today.
<br>
<p>My summary also includes Wicca and Paganism.  These belief systems 
<br>
were very much influenced by early Golden Dawn members.  Much of our 
<br>
modern understanding of ancient systems is really a projection of 
<br>
these modern beliefs onto ancient practices.  Instead of seeing all 
<br>
of these ancient systems as confirming a single coherent system, I 
<br>
see our modern understanding of all these systems as being derived 
<br>
from a single primary source of consolidation, e.g. the Golden Dawn. 
<br>
Although these different systems seem to be independent-minded, they 
<br>
all derive from a consistent &quot;canonization&quot; of standard doctrines, 
<br>
much as the Catholic Church standardized their dogmatic beliefs into 
<br>
a consistent whole.
