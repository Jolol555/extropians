<p>A Conversation With Richard Saul Wurman

<p>Fox: You've stated that your life's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passion is making information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understandable. In your experience,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;why does information tend to be so incomprehensible?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wurman: It's because understanding is so hard. To
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;understand something, in the real biblical sense, or to tell a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;literate 12-year-old what you're talking about or your mother,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and to have them understand you - that is not just a gift. It's a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;very difficult thing to achieve.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our systems of learning are not based on systems of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding. Instead, it is based on a system of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;memorization. For most people, schooling was the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;memorization of facts that they weren't particularly interested
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in - bulimically put on a piece of paper called a test and then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;quickly forgotten. And that has nothing to do with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if I ask you how big an acre is, and you happen to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;remember from junior high school that it's 43,560 square feet,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I still don't think that you necessarily understand what an acre
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is or that you can communicate it to another human being.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm interested in the communication of understandable

<p><p><p>Robert Fulford's column about TED (the Technology, Entertainment, Design
<br>
conference)
<br>
<a href="http://www.robertfulford.com/TED.html">http://www.robertfulford.com/TED.html</a>
<br>
(The National Post, February 25, 2000)
<br>
<p>Monterey, Calif.
<br>
<p>When Rebecca Dixon went to her first TED conference, it changed her
<br>
life. That's how she puts it, unashamedly, making it sound like the
<br>
laying on of hands by Billy Graham himself: &quot;It changed my life.&quot; She
<br>
knows that may sound naive and childlike, but she says it with certainty
<br>
and passion. She and a colleague went to a TED conference (it stands for
<br>
Technology, Entertainment, Design) and came away transformed. She became
<br>
a believer. She's back this week at TEDX, looking for further
<br>
enlightenment and more ways to apply it to her work. She manages the
<br>
design of the Web site for the American Association of Retired Persons
<br>
in Washington, which, with its 33 million members, is the most powerful
<br>
lobby in the U.S., capable of striking terror in the hearts of Congress.
<br>
AARP paid $3,000 (US), plus transportation and hotel, to have Rebecca
<br>
come here for three days, and sent several of her colleagues as well.
<br>
<p>At that earlier conference, something happened to her when she heard a
<br>
specialist in computer animation speak of the future of digital
<br>
technology. &quot;This is fire!&quot; he said, and she was stirred. He was saying
<br>
that digital technology is not just an improved means of communication
<br>
or a way of making work easier. Like the harnessing of fire, it's a
<br>
fundamental change in the way humans live -- a familiar idea to some,
<br>
but revolutionary to Rebecca. She and her colleague went back to their
<br>
office in Washington and soon found they were talking of little else but
<br>
what they had learned or intuited at TED.
<br>
<p>&quot;See, I wanted to be an artist,&quot; she said the other day, &quot;but when I was
<br>
growing up in North Carolina I imagined that all the great art had been
<br>
done. And now at TED I was getting the idea that perhaps this world that
<br>
was being invented by these people, the people talking at TED, was like
<br>
the Renaissance, where you had all those marvellously creative people
<br>
and everything was coming together.&quot;
<br>
<p>....
<br>
<p>&quot;TED is a phenomenon among conventions. It's a for-profit enterprise
<br>
that grosses more than two million a year and (though it doesn't
<br>
advertise, except on its Web page) always sells out.
<br>
<p>In fact, most of the places have already been sold for the TED
<br>
conference at Monterey in February, 2001. People who attended range from
<br>
theme-park creators to MIT professors, and from furniture designers to
<br>
health care executives. Venture capital people are usually among the
<br>
early sign-ups. Ross Mayot, vice-president for development of Canadian
<br>
Learning Television, has noticed their presence at several TEDs: &quot;They
<br>
love it. They swim through it like sharks, eating up ideas that will
<br>
soon [they hope] be start-ups.&quot;
