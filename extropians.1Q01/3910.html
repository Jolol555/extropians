</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Hey, tell Mars Polar Lander: Look what I did and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wasn't even designed to land!  Okay, so maybe Mars'

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but NEAR has an *awesome* navigation and sequencing

team.   (who are also good friends of mine  :-))

<p>Congratulations to Ann, Maureen and everyone.

<br>
<p>ITHACA, N.Y. -- Will this be the gang that could shoot straight? For the
<br>
past year, engineers and computer programmers from Johns Hopkins
<br>
University's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), assisted by NASA's Jet
<br>
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the imaging team at Cornell University,
<br>
have been figuring out how to slew a spacecraft precisely and aim its
<br>
camera perfectly for the final act of its mission: alighting on an asteroid.
<br>
<p>On Feb. 12 the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft, known as NEAR
<br>
Shoemaker, will attempt to land on Eros, an Earth-crossing asteroid about
<br>
196 million miles from Earth.  In mid-descent, an onboard camera will point
<br>
toward the surface and hopefully send back the best images ever from a
<br>
small, solar-system body.  The navigational prowess of APL and JPL will be
<br>
complemented by the imaging expertise of the Cornell research team.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's not like this craft is landing on a sphere.  It's descending on a
<br>
potato-shaped rock that is 22 miles long, and the rock has a large,
<br>
saddle-shaped hole on one side.  The rock continuously spins end-over-end.
<br>
Geometry is forcing us to land there -- where there is more motion than at
<br>
the poles -- so that NEAR's solar panels face the sun, its antenna points
<br>
to Earth and its camera faces the asteroid,&quot; says Cornell space sciences
<br>
researcher Ann Harch.  &quot;Other than that, it's easy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Use of the navigation team's telemetry, geometry and other calculations --
<br>
for this never-before-attempted maneuver -- required unique software to
<br>
point the camera, and it took more than a year to perfect.  Harch and her
<br>
Cornell research colleagues Maureen Bell and Colin Peterson and programmer
<br>
Brian Carcich worked with APL (which built the spacecraft and is managing
<br>
the mission) to develop special computer software that, with great
<br>
precision, displays the shape of Eros and how it will look from the
<br>
camera's point of view.   First an exact model of the asteroid's shape had
<br>
to be determined.  This shape-model software, called POINTS, developed by
<br>
Cornell's Jonathan Joseph, programmer analyst, and Peter Thomas, senior
<br>
research associate, correlates feature in thousands of images and plots the
<br>
asteroid's trajectory and orientation.  From that information, the program
<br>
calculates a detailed three-dimensional asteroid model.
<br>
<p>Harch, Bell and Peterson then used Orbit, a computer program developed at
<br>
Cornell by Carcich, to design pointing commands for the multispectral
<br>
imaging camera.  Orbit reads input data on the asteroid's location and spin
<br>
orientation, then shows where the craft and camera will point.  The program
<br>
also displays how the asteroid will look to the camera at each instant.
<br>
<p>This information allowed Harch, Bell and Peterson to cobble together
<br>
command sequences that were uploaded to NEAR Shoemaker throughout the
<br>
mission.  The comands take about 17 minutes for the information to be
<br>
received by the distant spacecraft and the same amount of time for the
<br>
craft to send back confirmation that the data was received.
<br>
<p>If all goes as planned, at 10:31 a.m. Eastern time on Feb. 12, the
<br>
spacecraft will commence firing a series of burns -- firing thrusters away
<br>
from the asteroid -- to brake the craft for an anticipated 7 mph landing.
<br>
Control commands to the onboard, multispectral camera will be uploaded to
<br>
the spacecraft.  However, if NEAR goes faster or slower than anticipated,
<br>
mission controllers at APL will be able to adjust the craft's onboard clock
<br>
to delay or advance the final photo sequence.  &quot;The spacecraft literally
<br>
has to be in the right place at the right time&quot; for the camera to function
<br>
as planned, says Harch.
<br>
<p>Reflecting on the five-year mission, Harch says:  &quot;This final week has been
<br>
such an emotional one.  It was an extraordinary experience working with
<br>
these people to produce such a fabulous result, and all of us feel that
<br>
way.&quot;
<br>
<p>Adds Bell, &quot;Getting this altogether has meant many, many late nights.&quot;
