<em>&gt;A question about this here (hick-up) moonshine...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One thing I notice as I review Appolo images is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lunar surface appears to have a specular-reflection effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that causes some areas of lunar surface to reflect brighter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than other areas relative to sun &amp; viewer positions (surface-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;luminosity differential is also a function of ground slant).
</em><br>

<br>
<p>That moon image is interesting ...!
<br>
<p>I don't know exactly why that effect, but I would guess that several
<br>
things are occuring, some already discussed in this thread:
<br>
<p>* The &quot;opposition&quot; effect is probably occuring (dominating).
<br>
* The moon is dusty (dust scatters light, different direction though),
<br>
* There are glassy particles on the surface (refracting light)
<br>
<p>Hal pointed to some literature already about the &quot;opposition
<br>
effect&quot;. Saturn's rings display this effect, for example. When the
<br>
illumination angle is zero, that is, when the viewing is from
<br>
precisely the same direction as the incoming sunlight, then we no
<br>
longer see the particles shadowing one another, and the object
<br>
&quot;surges&quot; in brightness. This is one way that scientists have
<br>
determined Saturn's rings thicknesses.
<br>
<p>The following some background on the other light-scattering effects.
<br>
<p>There is a large subfield in astronomy and planetary science that is
<br>
concerned with the optical properties of objects observed: i.e.
<br>
planetary surfaces, rings, comets, asteroids, etc. I'm not sure of
<br>
the correct name of the subfield, but usually when you hear one of
<br>
these scientists using words like: &quot;forward-scattered&quot;,
<br>
&quot;back-scattered&quot;, &quot;Mie scattering&quot;, &quot;phase-angles&quot;, &quot;I/F&quot;, then they
<br>
are very likely working an &quot;inverse problem&quot;: starting with an
<br>
image, and trying to infer the object's particle size, composition,
<br>
density. In addition, the optical properties of the object affect
<br>
the object's dynamics (if it is small), because there is a force
<br>
called: &quot;radiation pressure force&quot;, which is when photons skrike a
<br>
particle (a dust grain, say), and transfers momentum to the grain,
<br>
affecting its motion.
<br>
<p>When a photon (in the broader view: an &quot;electromagnetic wave&quot;, it
<br>
does not necessarily have to be in visible wavelengths) hits an
<br>
object, then several things can happen: the light can be scattered
<br>
or absorbed. In the mathematical description of the scattering
<br>
process, an &quot;optical efficiency factor Q&quot; is determined, which
<br>
depends on the particle's refractive index, size, some other
<br>
factors, and on the wavelength of light.
<br>
<p>To find the radiation pressure felt by a real particle in
<br>
interplanetary space, one uses Mie's solution to Maxwell's equations
<br>
(so-called &quot;Mie theory&quot;) to compute the optical efficiency factors
<br>
corresponding to the different optical properties of the various
<br>
wavelength regions and then one integrates these over the energy
<br>
distributed in the solar spectrum.
<br>
<p>Back to that dusty moon image.
<br>
<p>I would be interested in seeing a similar scene in both
<br>
forward-scattered and back-scattered light. I'll bet that you would
<br>
see it brighter in forward-scattered light. That is, take an image
<br>
of the moon's horizon in both lighting angles, The forward-scattered
<br>
image would be brighter, because there are dusty particles
<br>
encompassing a layer lifted off of the Moon's surface. David
<br>
Criswell's levitating moon dust (see below).
<br>
<p>&quot;Small&quot; and  &quot;large&quot; bodies, are well distinguished by their
<br>
scattering properties, because dust tends to be highly
<br>
forward-scattering whereas the parent bodies are mostly
<br>
back-scattering. The Sun radiates nearly all of its energy in a
<br>
narrow wave band around 0.6 microns so that the transition from
<br>
geometric optics to Rayleigh scattering takes place in the
<br>
micrometer size range. Therefore, if you take an image of an object
<br>
in back-scattered light (Sun behind the camera), and you take it
<br>
again in forward-scattered light (Sun behind you), and you find that
<br>
it is much brighter in forward-scattered light, then the object
<br>
contains a large number of micrometer-sized particles. For example,
<br>
Jupiter's ring is about ten to twenty times brighter in
<br>
forward-scattered light than back-scattered light. Most images of
<br>
circumplanetary dust were taken when the spacecraft was in the
<br>
planet's shadow, with illumination phase angles of ~180 degrees.
<br>
<p>On the glass beads on the lunar surface
<br>
<p>I looked into Paul Spudis' chapter; &quot;The Moon&quot; in _The New Solar
<br>
System_ by K. Beatty et al, and Spudis gave a nice description of
<br>
tiny (~0.03 mm across) beads of glass, that were found at virtually
<br>
all of the Apollo landing sites. They're volcanic-like, in nature,
<br>
created by a process cooling quickly. The color comes from a high titanium
<br>
content with some coated with zinc, lead, sulfur and chlorine.
<br>
A photo in the book (pg. 131) shows some lovely orange glass
<br>
&quot;moon beads&quot;. (I want some)
<br>
<p>On &quot;electrostatic dust transport&quot;
<br>
<p>(copying what I wrote last summer)
<br>
<p>Electrostatic dust transport on the Moon was first envisioned by
<br>
T. Gold in 1955 and then later, after the Surveyor 5,6,7 spacecraft
<br>
missions, the topic was embraced again by D.R. Criswell and co-workers
<br>
to explain some features seen in the lunar images. In those images, a
<br>
western horizon glow was observed following the local sunset. The most
<br>
likely explanation for the glow in the images is forward-scattered
<br>
sunlight by a cloud of dust particles, less than about 10 microns in
<br>
radii, *migrating away* from the sunlit hemisphere of the moon. The
<br>
cloud is created from tiny particles, levitated above (a few to a few
<br>
tens of centimeters) the lunar surface, the levitation caused by
<br>
repulsive forces between the charged particles and the extremely low-
<br>
electrically- conductive lunar surface.
<br>
<p>reference:
<br>
Criswell, D.R., chapter &quot;Horizon-glow and the motion of lunar dust&quot;,
<br>
in _Photon and Particle Interactions with Surfaces in Space_,
<br>
ed. R.Grard, Reidel, 1973. and many more papers....
<br>
<p>BTW, we had a discussion here on the list last September 2000 about
<br>
the Heiligenschein (thread had &quot;Heiligenschein&quot; in the subject), if
<br>
anyone wants to look into that too.
