<p>That's rather a non sequiteur. Would you mind explaining what you mean?
<br>
<p>The point I'm trying to make ( ... pause to take deep breath ... ) is
<br>
that there is a finite limit to food consumption. If we ignore weird
<br>
alternative uses like bathing in asses' milk, we can take a stab
<br>
at estimating the maximum food consumption our civilization can ever
<br>
demand. (We can even estimate the maximum demand in event of massive,
<br>
compulsory extravagence -- everyone bathes three times a day in cognac
<br>
and stuffs themselves silly on steak, while taking skiing lessons on
<br>
a butter mountain.)
<br>
<p>If we hit a point where supply outstrips demand, then prices are going
<br>
to fall as suppliers fight each other for market share. But sooner or
<br>
later the suppliers reach an equilibrium point where they can't afford
<br>
to cut prices further (and remain in business).
<br>
<p>The logical end-point is that once we have saturated the market for food,
<br>
and once prices have deflated at the lowest level that will support
<br>
any producers, there is simply *no* scope for economic growth left in
<br>
that field unless we manufacture more consumers.
<br>
<p>What part of &quot;there is a limit to how much food I can eat and how cheaply
<br>
it can be produced&quot; don't you agree with?
