Geometrodynamics, quantum fields, symmetry,
<br>
supersymmetry, topological quantum fields,
<br>
strings, superstrings, branes.
<br>
And now also: pre-geometry, ge-bits, topoi,
<br>
algorithmic-informational ontologies,
<br>
categorifications, logical fields.
<br>
Physical things become more and more abstract.
<br>
The mathscape. Or Plato's revenge?
<br>
<p>But Aristotle already said that all things
<br>
go from material [hylê] to form [eidos].
<br>
<p>And Heisenberg wrote: &quot;The underlying structure
<br>
of phenomena is not given by material objects,
<br>
as are Democritus' atoma, but by the form
<br>
determining the objects. Ideas are more essential
<br>
than objects&quot;.
<br>
<p>But Einstein noticed: ³As far as the laws of
<br>
mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain;
<br>
as far as they are certain, they do not refer to
<br>
reality². 
<br>
<p>David Mermin now says: ³Fields in empty space have
<br>
physical reality, the medium that supports them
<br>
does not. Quantum correlations have physical reality,
<br>
that which they correlate does not².
<br>
<p>And John Baez writes: ³Can philosophers really
<br>
contribute to the project of reconciling general
<br>
relativity and quantum field theory? Or is this a
<br>
technical business best left to the experts? I would
<br>
argue for the former. General relativity and quantum
<br>
field theory are based on some profound insights about
<br>
the nature of reality. These insights are crystallized
<br>
in the form of mathematics, but there is a limit to
<br>
how much progress we can make by just playing around
<br>
with this mathematics. We need to go back to the
<br>
insights behind general relativity and quantum field
<br>
theory, learn to hold them together in our minds,
<br>
and dare to imagine a world more strange, more
<br>
beautiful, but ultimately more reasonable than our
<br>
current theories of it. For this daunting task,
<br>
philosophical reflection is bound to be of help².
<br>
<p>Von Weizsaecker said that &quot;Nature is earlier than
<br>
man, but man is earlier than natural science&quot;.
<br>
Suggesting some morphism between neural nets and
<br>
logical fields? 
<br>
<p>For now: correlations, just correlations.
<br>
At the most: some morphism between mathematical
<br>
and logical objects and ontologies.
<br>
<p>Like these...

³Strings from Logic²
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0011065">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0011065</a>
<br>
What are strings made of? The possibility is
<br>
discussed that strings are purely mathematical
<br>
objects, made of logical axioms. More precisely,
<br>
proofs in simple logical calculi are represented
<br>
by graphs that can be interpreted as the Feynman
<br>
diagrams of certain large-N field theories.
<br>
Each vertex represents an axiom. Strings arise,
<br>
because these large-N theories are dual to string
<br>
theories. These &quot;logical quantum field theories&quot;
<br>
map theorems into the space of functions of two
<br>
parameters: N and the coupling constant.
<br>
Undecidable theorems might be related to
<br>
nonperturbative field theory effects.

³A Computer Scientist's View of Life,
<br>
the Universe, and Everything²
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9904050">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9904050</a>
<br>
Is the universe computable? If so, it may be much
<br>
cheaper in terms of information requirements to
<br>
compute all computable universes instead of just ours.
<br>
I apply basic concepts of Kolmogorov complexity
<br>
theory to the set of possible universes, and chat
<br>
about perceived and true randomness, life,
<br>
generalization, and learning in a given universe.
<br>
<p>Max Tegmark
<br>
³Is the theory of everything merely the ultimate
<br>
ensemble theory?²
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9704009">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9704009</a>
<br>
We discuss some physical consequences of what might
<br>
be called &quot;the ultimate ensemble theory&quot;, where
<br>
not only worlds corresponding to say different
<br>
&nbsp;sets of initial data or different physical
<br>
constants are considered equally real, but also
<br>
worlds ruled by altogether different equations.
<br>
The only postulate in this theory is that all
<br>
structures that exist mathematically exist also
<br>
physically, by which we mean that in those complex
<br>
enough to contain self-aware substructures (SASs),
<br>
these SASs will subjectively perceive themselves as
<br>
existing in a physically &quot;real&quot; world.
<br>
We find that it is far from clear that this simple
<br>
theory, which has no free parameters whatsoever,
<br>
is observationally ruled out.
<br>
The predictions of the theory take the form of
<br>
probability distributions for the outcome of
<br>
experiments, which makes it testable. In addition,
<br>
it may be possible to rule it out by comparing
<br>
its a priori predictions for the observable
<br>
attributes of nature (the particle masses,
<br>
the dimensionality of spacetime, etc) with
<br>
what is observed. 
<br>

<br>
³Does the universe in fact contain almost
<br>
no information?²
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9603008">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9603008</a>
<br>
At first sight, an accurate description of the state
<br>
of the universe appears to require a mind-bogglingly
<br>
large and perhaps even infinite amount of information,
<br>
even if we restrict our attention to a small subsystem
<br>
such as a rabbit. In this paper, it is suggested that
<br>
most of this information is merely apparent, as seen
<br>
from our subjective viewpoints, and that the algorithmic
<br>
information content of the universe as a whole is close
<br>
to zero. It is argued that if the Schroedinger equation
<br>
is universally valid, then decoherence together with
<br>
the standard chaotic behavior of certain non-linear
<br>
systems will make the universe appear extremely complex
<br>
to any self-aware subsets that happen to inhabit it now,
<br>
even if it was in a quite simple state shortly after
<br>
the big bang. For instance, gravitational instability
<br>
would amplify the microscopic primordial density
<br>
fluctuations that are required by the Heisenberg uncertainty
<br>
principle into quite macroscopic inhomogeneities, forcing
<br>
the current wavefunction of the universe to contain
<br>
such Byzantine superpositions as our planet being in many
<br>
macroscopically different places at once. Since decoherence
<br>
bars us from experiencing more than one macroscopic reality,
<br>
we would see seemingly complex constellations of stars etc,
<br>
even if the initial wavefunction of the universe was
<br>
perfectly homogeneous and isotropic.

³Self-Referential Noise as a Fundamental Aspect
<br>
of Reality²
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9905082">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9905082</a>
<br>
Noise is often used in the study of open systems,
<br>
such as in classical Brownian motion and in Quantum
<br>
Dynamics, to model the influence of the environment.
<br>
However generalising results from Goedel and Chaitin
<br>
in mathematics suggests that systems that are sufficiently
<br>
rich that self-referencing is possible contain intrinsic
<br>
randomness. We argue that this is relevant to modelling
<br>
the universe, even though it is by definition a closed
<br>
system. We show how a three-dimensional process-space
<br>
may arise, as a Prigogine dissipative structure, from a
<br>
non-geometric order-disorder model driven by, what is
<br>
termed, self-referential noise.

³Process Physics: Modelling Reality as Self-Organising
<br>
Information²
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0009023">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0009023</a>
<br>
The new Process Physics models reality as self-organising
<br>
relational information and takes account of the limitations
<br>
of logic, discovered by Goedel and extended by Chaitin,
<br>
by using the concept of self-referential noise.
<br>
Space and quantum physics are emergent and unified,
<br>
and described by a Quantum Homotopic Field Theory of
<br>
fractal topological defects embedded in a three dimensional
<br>
fractal process-space.
