<em>&gt; The remarkable thing is the growth rate in e-gold accounts--3,000 to 130,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in six months.  They also charge much lower transaction fees than credit card
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies.  And via OmniPay, you can pay bills from your e-gold account.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be interesting to see what happens when more and more transactions occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via these currencies.
</em><br>
<p>I think you misread the article; the growth was from mid 1999 to the
<br>
end of 2000, or 18 months rather than six.  Still that is a substantial
<br>
growth rate.
<br>
<p>We had some discussion here last year about online &quot;virtual stock&quot;
<br>
games like StockGeneration.  Most of these are Ponzi schemes and fail
<br>
eventually, leaving a lot of unhappy &quot;investors&quot;.  Several of these
<br>
companies were using e-gold as their payment service because it did not
<br>
have the provision for customers to contest payments as they can with
<br>
credit cards.  I had the impression that a substantial part of e-gold's
<br>
growth in early 2000 was due to these games, but I haven't been following
<br>
it lately.
