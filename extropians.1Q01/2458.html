<em>&gt;Then there's the technique described in a book that was required

<em>&gt;reading for a long-ago friend of mine when he got a job selling

<em>&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica. The title of the book was *The Art of

</em><br>
<p>Good suggestion.  It is true that we have a tendency to gloss over 
<br>
the parts we find agreeable and jump straight to the disagreements. 
<br>
That is because there is not much that needs to be said when we 
<br>
agree.  We don't want to quote every single point and respond with a 
<br>
&quot;Me too!&quot; agreement.  We actually are being efficient by doing this. 
<br>
The down-side is that we only respond with negatives.  Unlike 
<br>
face-to-face conversation where we would nod our head and show 
<br>
agreement without interrupting the conversation, the online 
<br>
discussion forum leaves a big void of nothingness where all this 
<br>
agreement occurs.  The only thing that is transmitted and can be 
<br>
verified is the points of contention.
<br>
<p>I think confirming all the points of agreement first, and then 
<br>
pointing out a smaller area of disagreement later, is an excellent 
<br>
method.
