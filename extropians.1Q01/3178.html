</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yup, agreed. This, incidentally, is one of the reasons I have a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with natural rights derived from some definition of human nature -- it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  replaces behaviour mandated by fiat (&quot;you'll do things my way because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I say so&quot;) with behaviour mandated by appeals to nature (&quot;you can't do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that -- it's unnatural&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>But these aren't the only two choices we have for a grounding of moral 
<br>
prescription and law.  Let's expand on the two alternatives you've 
<br>
identified.  First, of course, legal &quot;fiat&quot; isn't &quot;because *I* say so&quot;, but 
<br>
&quot;because *the state* says so&quot;.  This is an important distinction because 
<br>
usually people roll up a complete - and unconscious - theory of political 
<br>
legitimacy into the &quot;fiat theory&quot; of morality.  
<br>
<p>Second, there's a more sophisticated formulation of natural rights theory 
<br>
than to say that something is prohibited because &quot;it's not natural&quot;.  
<br>
Conceived of in the way you propose, rejection of a theory based on &quot;natural 
<br>
rights&quot; is trivially rational, since all one need do is observe that one can 
<br>
find examples of all sorts of bizarre behavior among humans, from 
<br>
socially-condoned ritual torture and cannibalism, to individual instances of 
<br>
obsession and aggression.  One simply need ask &quot;who decides what is 
<br>
'natural'?&quot; to dispose of such a simplistic notion of &quot;natural rights&quot;.
<br>
<p>As I've suggested, one can mean something else by &quot;natural rights&quot;, though, 
<br>
and by so meaning, point to a way that rejects both a shallow conception of 
<br>
what is &quot;natural&quot; AND a completely arbitrary subjectivity that ultimately can 
<br>
have no foundation other than raw power and coercion.  When *I* say &quot;natural&quot; 
<br>
in this context (i.e. as a basis for a conception of &quot;rights&quot;), I mean that 
<br>
there are certain rules of interaction among intentional actors that are BY 
<br>
THEIR NATURE conducive to promoting other values and that are effective 
<br>
regardless of complex social contexts.
<br>
<p>Now, this begs the question of which values to promote, but it at least 
<br>
pushes the question beyond that of &quot;rights&quot; in the legal sense.  I think that 
<br>
it is perfectly legitimate to view the natural rights legal ACTION of 18th 
<br>
century political ACTORS this way (I'm thinking in particular of Jefferson).  
<br>
Looked at in this way, we can salvage much of Enlightenment political and 
<br>
legal thinking from the morass of post-modernist relativism.
<br>
<p>I have written here and elsewhere regarding the possibility of a rational, 
<br>
non-subjective derivation of values that can give rise to rights:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/dialog1.jsp">http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/dialog1.jsp</a>
<br>
<p>. . . so I won't go into that more now. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  The taboo on passing judgements seems to me to arise from an inability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  conceive of the validity of a *subjective* judgement.  (Which, I suspect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  arises because these people think they've discovered the One True Way --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  something on an internal contradiction in their belief system, no?) It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  also a problem for those people who can't differentiate between folklore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and a testable theory.
</em><br>
<p>There are a number of notions intertwined in this passage.  I'm not sure I 
<br>
know what you mean by the &quot;validity&quot; of &quot;subjective judgments&quot;.  However, I 
<br>
certainly agree with your suspicion of moral and legal actions based on a 
<br>
concept of moral certainty.  The term you use suggests that you've read 
<br>
Virginia Postrel's &quot;The Future and it's Enemies,&quot; which I agree makes some 
<br>
very good points about the evils that can arise from moral certainty.  And I 
<br>
also agree that people who subscribe to the moral codes dictated by primitive 
<br>
tribal myths are a more immediate danger than any postmodern relativist, 
<br>
paralyzed into inaction by a fear of imposing his will on others.
<br>
<p>But just because we recoil in revulsion from the unassailable moral certainty 
<br>
felt by ayatollahs and christian prigs doesn't mean that the only alternative 
<br>
is a retreat to moral subjectivity, an unwillingness to make moral judgments 
<br>
and an inability to put those judgments into action through law.  Your 
<br>
reference to &quot;testable theory&quot; suggests that you may agree with this.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  The iterated prisoner's dilemma is the most powerful tool we've discovered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in attempting to build a solid ethical framework without appeals to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  nature, god's law, or the divine right of kings. You can sum up most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  my previous &quot;ethics in a void&quot; piece as an application of iterated PD
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  scenarios to human relationships. 
</em><br>
<p>Here we are in complete agreement.  However, I think we can actually come to 
<br>
a meaningful and scientific notion of &quot;natural rights&quot; from a study of the 
<br>
iterated prisoner's dilemma (&quot;IPD&quot;).  I would say that rules of social 
<br>
interaction - including, but not limited to, laws - which promote the most 
<br>
open and &quot;frictionless&quot; operation of the IPD are in fact expression of 
<br>
&quot;natural rights&quot; in a meaningful way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (And &quot;do unto others as you would be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by&quot; is, not coincidentally, a starting position for the winning &quot;tit for 
</em><br>
tat&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;  strategy.)
</em><br>
<p>It's not?  How so?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Theoretical concerns aside, I believe that the weakness engendered by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; cultural relativism poses a fundamental threat to survival over the 
</em><br>
coming 
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; decades.  Some cultural values and practices WORK in the modern world 
</em><br>
and 
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; others don't.  Some tend toward peace and prosperity, and others tend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; violence and poverty.  Not only do we have to be able to SAY this, we 
</em><br>
have 
<br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; be able to ACT on this realization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  By my definition, cultural relativism is a *winning* position. But I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not talking about idiot academics who think that, because we can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  certain we live in a perfect society, we cannot be allowed to criticize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  anyone else. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'd just like to note that the positions I'm opposed to are *all* 
</em><br>
absolutist
<br>
<em>&gt;  ones, and that I believe (at present) that moral absolutism is more likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to lead us into error than a healthy dose of skepticism
</em><br>
<p>Let me say that I think that the &quot;idiot academics&quot; who decry all 
<br>
inter-societal judgments are at least being consistent with their own notions 
<br>
of subjectivity.  I agree with them that one is disabled from expressing 
<br>
meaningful judgments about even one's own society's rules, much less another 
<br>
one's, once one accepts the notion that there is no objective grounding for 
<br>
moral judgments.  Where I disagree with them is the retreat to subjectivism.
<br>
<p>The word &quot;absolutist&quot; is quite powerful and rightly carries strong negative 
<br>
connotations.  However, before applying it with such negative force to all 
<br>
conceptions of morality and law other than a completely subjective one, 
<br>
consider that there may be, in fact, some morally defensible &quot;absolute&quot; 
<br>
judgments, although they must be reached and expressed with the greatest 
<br>
care.  If, in fact, one can deduce that open social systems that encourage 
<br>
trust between individuals reflect insights to be gained from rules 
<br>
mathematically derivable from the IPD, then it may be possible to make 
<br>
&quot;absolute&quot; moral judgments in a very narrow sense.  What one could never do 
<br>
is make absolute moral judgments in a decontextualized fashion, which I think 
<br>
is what you and I both recoil from.
