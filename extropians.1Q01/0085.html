<em>&gt; I'm new to this list, and I was wondering if many Extropians are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on CR (calorie restriction) or are signed up for Cryonics suspension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to increase chances of living to see the Singularity.

<em>&gt;Ive been doing a mild version of CR for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past 23 yrs, not signed up for cryonics yet, estimate chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of living to see singularity ~60%.  spike
</em><br>
---------------------------------
<br>
<p>As I understand it, the Singularity is a spike of accelerating
<br>
technological evolution, a very steep mountain of hi-tech expansion, a
<br>
tsunami of change brought about by the consilience of bio-tech, nanotech,
<br>
and AI-tech into human-competitive robots, and thence to worlds without
<br>
end. Fine and dandy... and the closer we get to it, the harder it is to
<br>
see. This Singularity is going to do whatever it wants to do. So, whether
<br>
or not we ever get to see it may not be our call. It looks to me as though
<br>
something this big is best seen from a distance. In fact, I could see it
<br>
more clearly ten years ago. But hey, maybe the last decade is catching up
<br>
with me. ô¿ô
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More important than being alive at the singularity is being alive one
</em><br>
day after
<br>
<em>&gt; the singularity. The only thing I can say about surviving this event is
</em><br>
that the
<br>
<em>&gt; odds are greater than zero and less than one.
</em><br>

<p>Sounds like pretty good odds, compared to the odds of surviving (for
<br>
example) cryonic suspension. The worst that can happen is Homo sapiens
<br>
sapiens becomes extinct, which it may have to do anyway, in order to
<br>
transcend biology. It's only the end of the world... and perhaps the
<br>
beginning of a Type I civilization. Moravec may be morose to think his
<br>
Mind Children can't keep up with a Singularity. Kurzweil's Spiritual
<br>
Machines should not shrink from this singular challenge. De Garis'
<br>
Artilects may aspire to be assimilated by the alien intelligence of the
<br>
Singularity. Some people may right now be thinking they could actually
<br>
survive singularity by uploading to an upgradable Robo sapiens. Somebody
<br>
stop me -- I'm philosophizing here.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
