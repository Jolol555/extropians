<p>Maybe I was misinformed, although I don't see how castor oil can avoid
<br>
having minute trace amounts of ricin since the oil comes from the bean,
<br>
which contains ricin. Yes, I know ricin is water soluble--that would
<br>
certainly prevent high concentrations of ricin in the oil, but insolubility
<br>
is really just very low solubility.
<br>
<p>But my original point--that castor oil doesn't work as a purgative because
<br>
it's undigestible--is correct. The mechanism doesn't seem to be well
<br>
understood. The two explanations I've found on the net seem as likely as the
<br>
trace ricin hypothesis I'd heard. One is that some component of the oil
<br>
stimulates the bowel muscles. The other is that ricinoleic acid prevents
<br>
absorption of liquids by the small intestine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Diarrhea is
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You're right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Castor oil contained ricin even in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than 1 milligram, and the damage is irreversible and generally
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There are many highly toxic substances with medicinal applications.
