<em>&gt; Note: &quot;set up proper secure communications with them&quot; means &quot;meet them

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, one can not do that without getting their key _in_person_.
</em><br>
<p>I think you're over-emphasizing the need to meet in person.
<br>
<p>In the first place, even if you do meet in person, that may not mean much.
<br>
How do you know the person you are meeting is the person you think you
<br>
are meeting?  Even if they are the right person, what good does that do
<br>
you if the person turns out to be dishonest and cheats you?
<br>
<p>In the second place, if you do trust a connection, perhaps because
<br>
it originated in person, then other people they recommend to you
<br>
electronically can be trusted as well.  Suppose you're part of an
<br>
underground movement and you met some members of the cell in person and
<br>
exchanged keys, those members can give you the keys of other members of
<br>
the group electronically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if you wish to engage in e-trade with some entity which you don't meet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in person, then somebody can have broken the communication security and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you lose. And you would not even notice it.
</em><br>
<p>Let's suppose you engage in e-trade with an entity *identified* by
<br>
a key.  And you find a number of recommendations from people you trust
<br>
saying that they have engaged in trade with that key and he was honest
<br>
and trustworthy.  Then you can engage in trade with an expectation of
<br>
honesty based on the party's reputation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anonymous cash fixes the vendor's problem but not the buyer's problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The vendor gets anonymous cash, and thus gets paid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the buyer cannot really know the vendor will deliver anything.
</em><br>
<p>There are some systems that can help with this.  An obvious example is
<br>
to turn the tables and pay upon delivery.  Another traditional technique
<br>
is to pay part in advance, part upon delivery.
<br>
<p>An unconventional technique used occasionally in real life is to tear a
<br>
$100 bill in half, then give half to the other party beforehand, the other
<br>
half afterwards.  Neither party can profit by cheating in this scenario.
<br>
Cryptographic techniques exist to do the same thing with ecash.
