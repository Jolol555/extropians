Good points about the different creeds. The question is whether the
<br>
legalistic systems or evangelical systems are the most resistant
<br>
towards extropian ideas. A legalistic religion might prohibit
<br>
something transhumanist for a more or less irrelevant reason
<br>
(e.g. judaism might be construed as incompatible with at least some
<br>
bionic implants since they would constitute self-mutilation, in
<br>
analogy to the sometimes claimed prohibition of tattos for the same
<br>
reason), but whether this would be a serious issue or not depends very
<br>
much how strictly a legalistic system is interpreted and applied by
<br>
people. There are always liberals and conservatives in this sense.
<br>
<p>An evangelical system might have an easier time disregarding the
<br>
legalistic aspects, and would instead ask: &quot;how does these proposed
<br>
technologies or changes in human nature fit the lifebelt?&quot;. A common
<br>
conservative christian argument against anything (be it luxury or life
<br>
extension) is that it would distract people from the love of
<br>
God. Again, interpretations differ, but these ones are not going to be
<br>
based on legal interpretation but on deeply help moral and emotional
<br>
principles. 
<br>
<p>That makes it more likely that people from a more evangelical bent who
<br>
resist changes will do so more strongly than people from a legalistic
<br>
religion. So a prediction based on this theory would be that even
<br>
fairly conservative judaism would be able to handle transhumanist
<br>
ideas, although they might be contorted a bit to fit the system (like
<br>
the wonderful and IMHO silly electric devices intended to be used
<br>
during the sabbath that are designed so that pressing the 'on' button
<br>
*breaks* a current and starts the system - since stopping things is
<br>
allowed on the sabbat, but not starting them). The really interesting
<br>
prediction would be that Islam might actually have an easier time
<br>
doing it, unless some core issue in transhumanism causes a dissonance
<br>
with the foundations of the religion, than Christianity. This is at
<br>
least a falsifiable prediction. 
<br>
<p>Of course, the original question was whether there was any core issues
<br>
between transhumanism and Islam, and I think we still have not
<br>
answered that.

<p>Is the reformed church for people living in open universes? As for
<br>
myself, I'm probably a liberal Tiplerian, thinking that the Omega

Point might not be possible in our universe or the foundation of all
<br>
existence, but it would be a good idea to bring it about in a baby
<br>
universe.
