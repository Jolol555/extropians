<p>Oh, what the hey...
<br>
<p>Yet Another Seven Signs of the Singularity:
<br>
<p>1) The public starts looking forward to debates between luddites and
<br>
AIs: by the time the luddite is done complaining about the problem,
<br>
the AI's either solved it or at least come up with a workaround that
<br>
most people are satisfied with.
<br>
2) At least 50% of all blue collar workers switch jobs, or maybe just
<br>
employers, daily or more frequently.
<br>
3) Entire industries become obsolete within a year of being born.
<br>
4) Your personal family/web of helper/extension AIs claims its own
<br>
solar system just to have enough resources to keep growing, and all
<br>
your friends wonder what took you so long.
<br>
5) People commonly ask what nanosecond, not what year, the Singularity
<br>
is finally expected to actually arrive.
<br>
6) &quot;Nothing is inevitable, even death and taxes&quot; becomes more popular
<br>
than &quot;Nothing is inevitable, except death and taxes&quot;.
<br>
7) The concept of Extropians, as they are today and as a separate and
<br>
distinct entity from the public, becomes obsolete.
