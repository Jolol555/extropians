<p>I am very curious why the opinions of myself and Eugene and others are
<br>
considered &quot;seething hate&quot;.  I was quite prepared to find good things to
<br>
like about MS and its software empire.  I earnestly attempted to do so a
<br>
few times now and not for short periods.  I found some good things and a
<br>
lot that is not at all good and some things that I think it is merely
<br>
factual to describe as 'evil'.  Does that make me guilty of unreasoning
<br>
and 'seething' hatred?  
<br>
<p>&lt;perfectly irrelevant material skipped...&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IBM/Intel/Microsoft working
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number of specific

<em>&gt; &gt; decisions, which can be traced back to the year 1978.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sorry, but after seeing and hearing the alternatives such as Scott
</em><br>
<em>&gt; McNealy and Larry Ellison, I'm not sure the world would be any better if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were top dogs.  This nonsense about &quot;damage ... inflicted upon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world&quot; just doesn't make any sense at all.  When I hear things like this, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel like you guys live in a totally different world than I do.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement about &quot;not seeing the alternative branches which would now exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if not for a number of specific  decisions, which can be traced back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year 1978&quot; implies some sort of evil conspiracy.  That doesn't make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense.  I posit that had a number of the chief competitors of your evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monsters (IBM/Intel/Microsoft) not reacted so slowly/poorly to the PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon of the late 70's, early 80's then the world WOULD be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different now.  They had their chance and lost.  Microsoft/Intel/IBM was NOT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sure thing back then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but McNealy and Ellison are simply some of the few
<br>
alternatives that survived!  Most you never heard of because they were
<br>
killed early.  Only those of us inside of them that know why they were
<br>
much more sound technically and tremendously important can see a lot of
<br>
this damage.  It is certainly not &quot;nonsense&quot;.  I don't think the problem
<br>
can be traced to 1978.  I think it can easily be traced to MS activities
<br>
of the last decade or so and the attendant reactions across the software
<br>
industry though. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It should be given some thought, why so many computer people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have such a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reaction towards Redmond. Hint: sour grapes it ain't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of the programmer types that I know who hate Microsoft generally do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause it's the &quot;cool thing to do.&quot;  Yes, MS has done some despicable things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the past and are probably still doing some, but that doesn't make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company evil, and certainly doesn't prove some sort of evil conspiracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories.  Hatred for Microsoft seems to be some sort of religious
</em><br>
<p>Hey.  I have been in this business for far longer than this business has
<br>
been &quot;cool&quot;.  I don't do a damn thing and never have because it is
<br>
&quot;cool&quot;.  So keep your mindless insults to yourself.  What do you call
<br>
the MS Halloween documents?  What do you call the tacticts that came out
<br>
at the Anti-Trust trial if you don't call them an evil conspiracy?  How
<br>
many evil things and how many evil plans does a company or a person have
<br>
to do and guide themselves by before you admit they are evil?  How many
<br>
things have to die at the touch of MS and its tactics before you
<br>
acknowledge some of its influence is poisonous?  
<br>
<p>Here we go again, trot out the notion that those who disagree with you
<br>
are being &quot;religious&quot; - great scare word of all psuedo-rationalist
<br>
spaces.  Pleeze. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps you have just been sucked in by the MS cult?  :-)
