</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Below is an article that was published yesterday that describes some of the

</em><br>
<p>I read it. The problem is that they are automatically assuming that sea
<br>
levels will rise just because there may be warming in tropical climates.
<br>
Antarctica will not collapse, this is what my cousin Andrew was awarded
<br>
his medal over, the ice cap there has been stable over the past 22
<br>
million years, so its not going anywhere unless a temperature change
<br>
greater than any seen in that time period occurs. The primary item of
<br>
concern is the Greenland ice cap, which may raise sea levels somewhere
<br>
on the order of 3-9 feet. This alleged collapse is not imminent, nor is
<br>
it inevitable. If the UN claims are accurate, Florida and these other
<br>
areas must have experienced similar sea level changes in the last 3.2
<br>
million years. How old is the Greenland Ice cap? Is it a relatively new
<br>
phenomenon?
<br>
<p>What is of concern is not the environmental effects, but the effects on
<br>
humans. If Greenland's ice cap collapses, has anyone understood that
<br>
this means lots of land available in Greenland for settlement and
<br>
cultivation, land that is covered by dirt ground up from many thousands
<br>
of years of ice abrasion? As the ice melts, it will deposit thousands of
<br>
years of dust and pollen into this soil, providing a read made loam for
<br>
eco-prospectors to terraform Greenland as we desire. There will be
<br>
plenty of water there.
<br>
<p>The fact is that the UN is running on old data. They still are
<br>
functioning on theories about the catastrophic collapse of the antarctic
<br>
ice cap, which my cousin has proven (and its original proponents have
<br>
admitted) to be totally false.
