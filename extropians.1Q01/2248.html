</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe society _is_ a living entity. A pretty dumb one, but I think it
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; hive, for instance.)
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, doesn't compute. 
<br>
Just because it *resembles* a living organism does not make it one. You
<br>
might as well go out and form the PETMO, the People for the Ethical
<br>
Treatment of Memetic Organisms, and see if YOU don't get laughed at.
<br>
Hives are not single organisms, despite the best efforts of socialist
<br>
scientists to claim it is so. A 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturally, the 'group entity' only behaves as a living thing, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely a system; it does not 'live' in the strict sense of the word. But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something acts as if it is alive, then I see no reason to insist, like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to, that it is &quot;_NOT_ alive, because I _DON'T_ want to see it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that is alive&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't not want to see it as alive. Its rather obvious that its not a
<br>
living organism. Humans have developed technologies based on their
<br>
observation of nature, of systems that work well. Just because human
<br>
technologies resemble natural systems doesn't make them alive in any way
<br>
shape or form. Carrying your claim further, you might as well claim a
<br>
whole ecosystem is one organism. It is not, despite the semantic games
<br>
of 'gaia theory' tree hugging nutjobs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We already have large numbers of such 'group entities', and they are of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most ordinary kind - businesses, armies, and even entire countries. We all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively participate in them - the only person I could think of that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participate in any 'group entity' would be someone living alone on an island
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere, with little or no interactions to any other human being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, whether you accept it or not, you _are_ a part of a 'living' organism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are but a tiny cell in it. The organism takes care of you, and you make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own tiny contributions to the organism. Actually, you most probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively participate in more than one such organism. As do I.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, no. I'm self employed. I am perfectly capable of, and do on
<br>
occasion, support myself separate from all human civilization. Being a
<br>
cell is far more than just being a participant in a system. A cell is a
<br>
unit that is entirely dependent on the organism for its survival, where
<br>
it cannot survive outside the organism. Humans do not meet this
<br>
criteria. This is another example of you being infected by socialist
<br>
memes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is not surprising that the idea of the sovereign individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is under assault even here in the US. The last century of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immigration by people infected by socialist memes to the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has created our culture war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are starting to repeat yourself. Not only that, you seem to talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 'people infected with memes' as if you were totally free of them.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say that, I said &quot;people infected by socialist memes&quot;. I am not
<br>
infected with such memes. Any memes I may have are what Barnes calls the
<br>
'freecyber' type described in his novels. They are beneficial parasites,
<br>
like the flora in my gut, the mites on my skin and hair, etc. They do
<br>
not subsume my individuality to some imagined greater organism.
<br>
<p>And so what if 'society' IS an organism. If we buy the left's premise of
<br>
rights being based on force, then any individual is entirely within
<br>
their rights to wage all out war against socialist societies. Nuke'em,
<br>
fry'em, smoke'em.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Man has natural rights because he has evolved under the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of physics and biology to be the creature he/she is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This statement makes 0 sense to me. I see no logical structure to it. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds like &quot;man has rights because he is&quot;. Have you ever even defined what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the term 'rights' means?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps we should start with that: if you disagree with the 'rights by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negotiation' definition that was proposed, why don't you come up with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own definition of 'rights'? One that does not result in a circular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference, preferrably.
</em><br>
<p>The human animal evolved with the ability to speak and communicate with
<br>
others of his species, the ability to record thoughts and understand
<br>
those recorded thoughts, to freely choose other humans to associate with
<br>
in a manner not dictated by pheromones, or due to clone clans like
<br>
hives, or colonies like coral. The human animal evolved &quot;not with the
<br>
claw, fang, stinger, or horn, but with the hand, thus any tool or weapon
<br>
which he may fashion or wield with the hand it is his natural right&quot;.
<br>
Because of his ingenuity in making tools, man is naturally able to
<br>
multiply the efficiency of his effort and store food, tools, shelter,
<br>
and raw materials for later use at need, it is man's natural right to
<br>
own property. As man evolved to survive best when he/she treated his
<br>
fellow humans with respect and trust, to not initiate force upon fellow
<br>
humans, but to swiftly defend themselves, their families and property
<br>
against those who violated this trust.
<br>
<p>These rights are not negotiated, they are objectively observed from
<br>
nature as an optimum state and applied as a standard of behavior.
