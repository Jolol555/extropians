Yeah ...
<br>
<p>You know the Richard Dawkins explanation for religion? His take on why
<br>
religious memes are so widespread is that they confer survival advantages
<br>
from a couple of different angles. Firstly, they reduce the carrier's
<br>
susceptibility to existential angst. Secondly, those that stress life-after-
<br>
death ensure a ready supply of warriors who can be sent forth to convert
<br>
the heathens. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Optimism/Pessimism/Other guiding principle) is something that you adopt in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the face of lack of information; 
</em><br>
<p>So is religious faith. 
<br>
<p>(Speaking as a fanatical agnostic, I find blind faith disturbing
<br>
-- whether it's in a future world when we achieve True Communism or
<br>
Libertopia, or whether it's in the Rapture and the establishment of the
<br>
Kingdom of Christ, or whatever. Hence, maybe, my railing against 
<br>
excessive optimism ...)
