A more eloquent response:
<br>
A free press guards against tyranny and abuse of power,&quot; said Ramona 
<br>
Ripston, Executive Director of the ACLU of Southern California, &quot;and 
<br>
those who abuse power inevitably seek to control the images we see 
<br>
and the stories we hear.&quot;
<br>
&quot;We ordinarily receive calls after protests,&quot; Ripston added, &quot;but 
<br>
never in my memory have we received so many calls from members of the 
<br>
media who were attacked.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Al Crespo was targeted because the recording eye of his camera 
<br>
threatened to capture the LAPD's violent and lawless behavior,&quot; said 
<br>
Ripston. &quot;The bullets that struck him were not simply aimed at him. 
<br>
Their ultimate aim was to dislodge the eyes and ears of the public, 
<br>
to control our understanding of the events that unfolded Monday 
<br>
night, and to shut down the truth-telling role that media, at their 
<br>
best, can play.&quot;
<br>
&quot;The dangers here, both physical and Constitutional, are grave,&quot; said 
<br>
Ripston. &quot;They demand of us a vigilant and swift response. We cannot 
<br>
allow the Los Angeles Police Department to operate free of the 
<br>
constraints of public scrutiny - we know too well what happens when 
<br>
they do.&quot;
<br>
They get away with this? Down the line, the bullets won't be rubber.

&gt; &gt; I read your post and what you quoted and thought, &quot;Wow, that sounds 
&gt; &gt; bad.  Some guy was shot by the cops in LA?&quot;  But when I followed the 
&gt; &gt; link, I learned that the cops were only firing rubber bullets.  I'm 
&gt; &gt; sure they sting like an SOB, but if the guy had been shot in Kosovo, 
&gt; &gt; it wouldn't have been with rubber bullets.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The whole time I was reading the article, I was wondering about the 
&gt; &gt; motivation of the police officers.  Did a riot seem imminent?  Had 
&gt; &gt; officers been injured?  Was there some type of perceived threat to 
&gt; &gt; innocent bystanders or public property?  Unfortunately, the article 
&gt; &gt; doesn't cover the police perspective except for one little quote from 
&gt; &gt; a police spokesperson.  Instead of providing any real information 
&gt; &gt; about the event that might have given a discerning reader a full 
&gt; &gt; picture of what happened, the article seemed only to pander to 
&gt; &gt; typical anti-police sentiment in the worst one-sided way.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Even if you take all of the complaints as true - a dubious decision 
&gt; &gt; at best - the worst things that happened were that a woman was 
&gt; &gt; knocked down and cut her knee, and a guy lost his camera.  If that's 
&gt; &gt; all that happened and a serious riot was prevented, I say, 
&gt; &gt; &quot;Congratulations to the LAPD&quot;.
