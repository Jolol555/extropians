<p><em>&gt;From Brian Williams:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's wrong with people who commit crimes serving their full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, the question here is this:  What is the purpose of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prison, anyway?  Most everyone who's been through a civis or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government class encouners this question at least at some level. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While I think we can all agree that prison is a deterrent to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level, the question comes to be what is the main purpose of prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in any modern society, not just that of the US:  Is prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposed to be punitive, or is it supposed to be rehabilitative? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And can it possibly be both at the same time?
</em><br>
<p>I think it can be both, maybe the idea of the harder you work at
<br>
your own rehabilitation, the shorter the sentence is worth a try.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I personally would argue that prison should be more a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rehabilitative forum than a forum for punishment.  Rehabilitation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while initially costlier, can often be much less expensive in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long run because of decreased recidivism and increased
</em><br>
<em>&gt;productivity to society.  A form of &quot;enforced welfare&quot; perhaps.
</em><br>
<p>We should allow for the chance to rehabilitate to those who can be
<br>
rehabilitated. The rest probably need to remain where they are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Granted - the question of if prison should really exist at all or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not is never seriously addressed.  What is the nature of crime and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;punishment in a situation where the locus of power is geared more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;towards the individual than any social structure?  On what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;foundation does the concept of &quot;criminal justice&quot; lay?  Does any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;governmental instrument have either the right or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsibility to attempt to rehabilitate or punish individuals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and how would this idea scale into a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarian/econo-anarchic model?
</em><br>
<p>To general for me, how's this, I believe there are people who can
<br>
be rehabilitated and those who cannot. Those who cannot (usually
<br>
really will not) should remain behind bars.
