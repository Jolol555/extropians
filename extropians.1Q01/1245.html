The fact remains: He was an outsider, a mathematician, and not 
<br>
someone trained in the discipline of physics, which is where he 
<br>
stirred things up. Unless you consider &quot;self-study&quot; to be equivalent 
<br>
to training. I suspect, perhaps incorrectly, that you equate only 
<br>
formal study with 'training in the discipline.' 
<br>
<p>Yah; he read this stuff as a student. Access to papers and colleagues 
<br>
was a bit different later, in the patent office, where he developed 
<br>
his theories.

<p>&nbsp;You're right - biological evolution is indeed `just a

theory' - that is, an always provisional broad framework for

organizing our
<br>
many observations of the living world and allowing competent 
<br>
scientists
<br>
trained in the discipline to make powerful, unexpected and 
<br>
falsifiable
<br>
predictions. In the same way, the *theories* of relativity (the 
<br>
universe at
<br>
the very large, very fast scale) and quantum theory (the universe at 
<br>
the
<br>
very smallest scale) are also *theories*.

&gt; This is so preposterous I wonder why the man bothers. I suppose somebody
&gt; needs to spell out exactly how dumb this claim is. Let's turn to the
&gt; authoritative scientific biography by Abraham Pais, SUBTLE IS THE LORD.
&gt; 
&gt; p. 44: `... on the whole Einstein did not excel in regular course
&gt; attendance. He relied far more on self-study. As a student he read the
&gt; works of Kirchoff, Hertz and Helmholtz; learned Maxwell theory from the
&gt; first edition... by August Foppl... read Mach's book on mechanics, `a book
&gt; which, with its critical attitudes toward the basic concepts and basic
&gt; laws, made a deep and lasting impression on me'; and studied papers by
&gt; Lorentz and Boltzmann. Among other subjects which drew his attention was
&gt; the work of Darwin.'
&gt; 
&gt; p. 46: ` &quot;Since September 15, 1901.. I wrote my doctoral dissertation on a
&gt; topic in the kinetic theory of gases...&quot; This work was not accepted as a
&gt; thesis, however. This setback was the last one in Einstein's career, however.'
&gt; 
&gt; 58:  following work on the foundations of statistic mechanics, and his
&gt; epochal paper on the light-quantum hypothesis, `Completion of the PhD
&gt; thesis on a new determination of molecular dimensions.'
