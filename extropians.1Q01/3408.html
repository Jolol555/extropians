<em>&gt; &gt; picking on &quot;target&quot; groups start driving a pickup truck.  I have driven a

<p>One time a highway patrolman could have pulled over me, in a car, or a truck,
<br>
driving through morning rush hour traffic near Fort Worth.  So, we both pulled
<br>
over, but I got to drive away.  The truck had just passed me.
