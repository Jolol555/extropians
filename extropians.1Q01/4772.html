I alerted some friends to the existence of &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot;,
<br>
A Book Précis, by Raymond Kurzweil
<br>
( <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0012.html?printable=1">http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0012.html?printable=1</a> ),
<br>
and I've been a little surprised by a couple of the positive
<br>
responses I've gotten.  I bought copies of _The Age of Spiritual
<br>
Machines_ (Kurzweil) and _Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent
<br>
Mind_ (Moravec) back in early '99 to lend to people, with tepid
<br>
responses at best (though I should mention that I got a
<br>
very excited response from a guy at work to whom I lent my
<br>
copy of Damien Broderick's _The Spike_ -- back in '97, I think it
<br>
was).  I've also tried getting people to sample Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky's Web essays, with no success at all (sorry, Eliezer :-&lt; ) --
<br>
though **I** thought these were **fabulous** when I stumbled
<br>
across them in early '97, I think they may be a little
<br>
off-putting to &quot;civilians&quot;.
<br>
<p>However, Kurzweil's new Web article may be just the ticket for
<br>
getting acquaintances acquainted with the big S.  It's less of
<br>
an imposition than trying to push a book on somebody (it's also
<br>
snappier and more to the point, and less long-winded and cutesy
<br>
than the earlier _Spiritual Machines_, which also had an
<br>
unfortunate title, IMO).  I've taken the liberty of including the
<br>
following e-mail exchange with one friend (with the permission of
<br>
Michael S. Goldfarb).  Oh, and I've sent S-packets past this
<br>
friend in the past, but this is the first one that he's ever
<br>
really grabbed (or that's grabbed him)!
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Wow! I just finished reading it. (Well, skimming it anyway. [It's a good
<br>
thing that I will soon be able to extend my intelligence so that I don't
<br>
immediately glaze over when mathematical formulae are introduced!]) Quite
<br>
impressive, and possibly even largely probable. Somehow, I doubt that the
<br>
progression of events that he describes will go quite so smoothly. He
<br>
ignores a good deal of the complex social crises that the Singularity will
<br>
bring to a head (have vs. have-not, scientific vs. religious, the whole
<br>
moral/ethical/legal quagmire, etc.) The sort of thing that Asimov or
<br>
Heinlein would have described in their golden-age stories as &quot;the nasty
<br>
conflict between the more-than-human Extenders vs. plain old humans&quot;.
<br>
<p>Well, I guess it's going to be an interesting ride. Nice to hear so much
<br>
carefully thought-out optimism instead of the usual dystopia stuff. I
<br>
sincerely hope that all our economic and social models are indeed operating
<br>
on obsolete principles... (Of course, I remain essentially pessimistic!)
<br>
Gee, Ray's a REALLY smart guy, isn't he? (And yes, I had a prickle of pride
<br>
when he mentioned his '70s OCR technology!) [Michael had operated
<br>
early Kurzweil OCR equipment before we became acquainted, 
<br>
and had a great deal of respect for Kurzweil before I
<br>
ever knew who he was.]
<br>
<p>Thanks for sending this, it was a thought-provoking and inspiring read.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Michael,
<br>
<p>Glad to hear you enjoyed it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Somehow, I doubt that the progression of events that he describes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will go quite so smoothly.
</em><br>
<p>I don't expect it's going to be smooth, either.  On the other hand,
<br>
when I saw Kurzweil in person giving a keynote speech at PC Expo
<br>
last summer (he talked about the same thing as in the Web
<br>
article, and showed the same graphs), he mentioned the fact
<br>
that, on one of his graphs, the Great Depression was barely
<br>
a glitch in the long-term trend (that graph is in the Web article,
<br>
it's the one labelled &quot;U.S. GDP In Constant Dollars&quot;; look at the
<br>
black data points for the glitch, not the smooth blue line).
<br>
<p>When you think of all the suffering during those years, it's a
<br>
bit appalling that it fades so quickly into insignificance in the
<br>
big picture.  I pointed out on the Extropians' not so long ago
<br>
that, if Kurzweil's (and similar) predictions about the mass of
<br>
non-biological intelligence eventually dwarfing the mass of human
<br>
intelligence on the planet is accurate, we could have a war that
<br>
wipes out 99% of the human race, and it still might only look
<br>
like a &quot;glitch&quot; in the big picture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...the complex social crises that the Singularity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring to a head (have vs. have-not, scientific vs. religious, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole moral/ethical/legal quagmire, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>Some of this has already started, in the debates about genetically-
<br>
engineered crops, use of fetal tissue in research, cloning, etc.
<br>
But would you believe that one very smart person -- Bill Joy
<br>
of Sun Microsystems, of all people (the inventor of 'vi' and Java!) has
<br>
started to call for the government to step in to put limits
<br>
on uncontrolled technological growth, and is calling for corporations
<br>
to start thinking about ways to adopt a voluntary policy of
<br>
&quot;relinquishment&quot;.  For his latest spiel, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/4140.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/4140.html</a> --
<br>
it's the full text of an article (don't bother with the link it gives --
<br>
that's stale) from the San Jose Mercury News about a panel in which Joy
<br>
participated in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago.  This would have
<br>
to involve a **major** curtailment of civil liberties, which Joy thinks
<br>
is better than the alternatives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...The sort of thing that Asimov or Heinlein would have described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their golden-age stories as &quot;the nasty conflict between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more-than-human Extenders vs. plain old humans&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, or what Hugo de Garis calls the conflict between the &quot;Terrans&quot;
<br>
and the &quot;Cosmists&quot;.  See
<br>
<a href="http://foobar.starlab.net/~degaris/artilectwar.html">http://foobar.starlab.net/~degaris/artilectwar.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gee, Ray's a REALLY smart guy, isn't he?
</em><br>
<p>Yes he is, but he's by no means the only smart person thinking
<br>
about these things (or even writing books about them).  However, he
<br>
is emerging as the most publicly visible of the pro-technologists,
<br>
at the same time as Joy is emerging as the spokesperson of
<br>
the anti-technology technologists.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Okay, I just wanted to briefly mention that I read most of de Garis'
<br>
material and found it interesting, if hyperbolic. The Kurzweil piece seemed
<br>
better thought out and more believable, though any kind of prognosticating
<br>
beyond the next ten years or so seems pretty dubious, if not futile.
<br>
(Personal experience: Even after I listened to your first CD player...,
<br>
I figured it would take a decade or two for CDs to eclipse
<br>
the entrenched LP technology... and it took about five years.)
<br>
<p>What I find interesting (and I'm sure is also one of your traditional
<br>
appreciations of this material) is how closely it hews to so many classic
<br>
(and little-known, but familiar to folks like us who've read thousands of
<br>
novels over the decades) SF tropes. Apart from some of the specifics of the
<br>
new technologies, there is actually very little about it that hasn't been
<br>
treated in some (fictitious) detail before. Even just limiting ourselves to
<br>
the narrow confines of SF in movies/TV, we're talking Krell machines, the
<br>
Terminator future, the Borg, Dr. Forbin's dilemma, V'ger, Replicants, the
<br>
Monolith, etc. Whoa...
<br>
<p>Well, you've done it - I find I am actually somewhat interested in this
<br>
Singularity/new intelligence/evolutionary leap stuff. Given my vast SF
<br>
background, how could I NOT be?!?
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>As to Bill Joy, you must know that anything resembling repression of the
<br>
creative/scientific impulse, no matter whose &quot;good&quot; it's for, just scares
<br>
the bejeesus out of me. Since, if I weren't a card-carrying liberal Dem,
<br>
I'd probably be a Libertarian, I'm all for a laissez-faire approach to
<br>
invention. But there are some awfully scary times a-comin', aren't there?
