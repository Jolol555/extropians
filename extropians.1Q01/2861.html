<p><em>&gt;But punishment looks a lot like revenge.  If it is not a deterrent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and does not rehabilitate what and who is it for?
</em><br>
<p>The victim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Segregating them from the population is a different beast than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;punishment, deterrence or rehabilitation.
</em><br>
<p>Okay lets make an example here.
<br>
<p>Two malcontents break into my apartment and make off with a bunch
<br>
of my stuff, and ignore my thousands of books except maybe to throw
<br>
them around the room as punishment for not being able to get into
<br>
my gun safe. Unlike most times, these two get caught, tried, and
<br>
it's now time for......what exactly?
<br>
<p>Well, first I want my stuff back. Then I want compensation for all
<br>
the hastle I've got to go through getting my life in order. Then I
<br>
want something done so these two don't pull anything like this
<br>
again.
<br>
<p>Now, whats going to really happen? Almost nothing, I'm not going to
<br>
see anything resembling compensation so we can forget that.
<br>
<p>It's likely that for a little while these two are going to be
<br>
deprived of what little joy they have in life, which pretty much
<br>
seems to amount to stealing other peoples stuff. They don't get to
<br>
hang out, they don't get to sit home and watch T.V. or do anything
<br>
else they like to do for awhile.
<br>
<p>So yeah, for awhile I want them someplace they don't want to be,
<br>
doing stuff they don't want to do, eating stuff they don't like,
<br>
and hoping they get the idea that they did wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are you crazy?  A larger pot of money put into prisons will simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increase the payoff for abuses laws and incarceration policies.
</em><br>
<p>Busted, naw just ranting....
