Just a quick note: The talk went very well. Apparently they has already 
<br>
watched a Discovery channel documentary on Alcor and had been through my 
<br>
Web site.
<br>
<p>In addition to the teacher, two other rabbis sat in. They both kept nodding 
<br>
in agreement, and seemed very receptive. The main focus was cryonics, but I 
<br>
covered superlongevity and put everything in an extropian context. The 
<br>
questions were intelligent and friendly. One student actually asked how he 
<br>
could join ExI.
<br>
<p>They videotaped the class, so they can show it in future, though I will 
<br>
probably go back and do it again. It's such a pleasure to find active young 
<br>
minds willing to listen, think, and engage.
<br>
<p>The day I am invited to speak at Bob Jones University, I will think that 
<br>
we're making *real* progress!
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
