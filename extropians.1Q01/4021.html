<p>You can't mean that part. Ever hear of Falun Gong? Ever hear of the
<br>
Roman Empire's actions toward Christianity in the first few centuries
<br>
CE? Evidently imprisonment, torture and public execution aren't direct?

<p>Do what thou wilt. I'm for aikido, myself. I'm also an agnostic, since
<br>
&quot;God/god(s)&quot; is a squirmy concept with a lot of wiggle factor.

<p><em>&gt; Young children in particular will believe whatever is told to them,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And young people will often appear to rebel, and then fall back on the
<br>
faiths of their fathers (or whatever their model of it is). Why kick the
<br>
props out from under them? Why, for instance, try to deprive a terminal
<br>
cancer patient of her epiphany/notion that the world has a plan?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But sure, what are your suggestions for a &quot;sneak attack&quot; on Xian
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I have no master plan, just a bunch of heuristics. You, on the other
<br>
hand, have a master plan.
<br>
I hope to pay attention to what works. You and I appear to have
<br>
different attentions. This is OK; a sheaf of strategies is probably a
<br>
good idea. One-size-fits-all fits few. Things got the way they are
<br>
because people have been the way they have been.
<br>
<p>I have, in years past, sometimes thought that the final battle, if it
<br>
comes, will not be between good and evil, but between the forces of good
<br>
and the forces of good-and-evil-at-the-same-time. See Sowell's
<br>
&quot;constrained&quot; vs. &quot;unconstrained&quot; visions.

</em><br>
<p>Umm. Right. I have delusions of _adequacy_, myself.
