<em>&gt;One of the interesting things I learned from the articles I've read
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the TED conferences is that Wurman doesn't pay any speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fees, even though many of the speakers could command $30,000 -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$50,000/event, and even though Wurman himself charges $3 - $4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;K/ticket.
</em><br>
<p>Chris, we don't pay Extro speakers, and never have, though we pay varying 
<br>
amounts of speakers' expenses, depending on their level of interest and 
<br>
wealth. If we had to pay speakers we would be bankrupt, since we don't 
<br>
charge $3 - $4,000 like Wurman, or even $2 - $3,000 like many business 
<br>
conferences, or the $595 that Foresight charges for the Senior Associate 
<br>
meeting (not including $250 to become an SA) or the $675 + tutorial for the 
<br>
main Foresight conference. Even covering expenses for speakers not in 
<br>
California is difficult enough. [Contacts for possible corporate sponsors 
<br>
are very welcome!]
<br>
<p>I like your suggestions. I am already employing your first suggestion to 
<br>
some extent. For instance, last night I talked to one of the three &quot;fathers 
<br>
of artificial intelligence&quot; -- John McCarthy -- and increased his interest 
<br>
by letting him know that we could probably also get his friend Marvin 
<br>
Minsky to come along too. This works especially well for Extro-5 since the 
<br>
sessions include 2-4 main speakers together rather than a series of solo 
<br>
speakers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ask attendee's to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a short biography describing their accomplishments, and a photograph.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Put them up on the Extro conference sign up page so potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attendees can see who they will have the opportunity to meet if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decide to attend.  Same thing for Extropy members
</em><br>
<p>I like this idea too, though I don't know how many people would want to put 
<br>
up their information. If we provide a simple template to make it easy, it 
<br>
might work well. I'd like to hear what others think of the idea.
<br>
<p>BTW, additional Web pages for the conference, including an updated Program 
<br>
and some initial speakers will go up this week.
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
