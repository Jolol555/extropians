<em>&gt; Don't choose languages/platforms/OSes etc based on what you like; choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what people are using, and are going to be using more in the future. In
</em><br>
real
<br>
<em>&gt; world coding, you very rarely get to choose your tools; they are part of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; initial parameter set.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I highly recommend ASP, on IIS, with SQL Server backend, as a good
</em><br>
starting
<br>
<em>&gt; set of employable skills. I'm currently working using this set of
</em><br>
products,
<br>
<em>&gt; with the caveat that the same products must also support Oracle, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caveat that javascript is used for ASP programming rather than VBScript, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very sound choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of the purists will come out of the woodwork and attack me for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint. It does sound like a banal and colourless life. Don't be
</em><br>
fooled;
<br>
<em>&gt; the mainstream technology is not only rewarding in a financial sense, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun. It's fun because it keeps changing at a crazy pace. When you've got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the coders, and most of the install base, you can afford to put a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of effort into development. This means things are rarely ever the
</em><br>
same,
<br>
<em>&gt; which is damned hard, but always interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note also; I've had a lot of jobs, and never used even similar sets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills/languages from one job to the next; the primary language to use,
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; instance, has always been entirely new to me. That's not uncommon. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no need to get cut up on becoming a specialist in language X or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; database Y. Just get really good at learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Beware of the hype, Emlyn, lest it become self-fulfilling to the blind
<br>
(which is exactly what MS, Oracle, etc.  are  counting on). Its due to
<br>
thinking like this that the software industry is in the mess it is (i.e..
<br>
cost over-runs, projects that fail to  meet spec ...).
<br>
<p>If given the chance, a software engineer/developer should consider the
<br>
project requirements and available resources, and use the tool-set most
<br>
appropriate for the job (unfortunately not always possible considering the
<br>
pro-MS bigotry present in relatively ignorant management circles)  If all
<br>
you need is Access, then use Access. If you need something more meaty, then
<br>
consider using Oracle or SQL Server - but don't jump straight to SQL Server
<br>
just because its MS.
<br>
<p>There's a good reason why Oracle has ~60% of the Enterprise database market,
<br>
and why Apache has ~60% of the web-server market (MS has ~20%). (See
<br>
www.netcraft.com for server info)
<br>
<p>Last year we looked at moving across to the Sun devised J2EE platform, and
<br>
EJB's (Enterprise Java Beans) in particular.  It was incredibly difficult to
<br>
separate the hype from the facts - it seemed that every consultant that was
<br>
in any way involved with these technologies was screaming at us to adopt it.
<br>
However, digging deeper revealed the hype to be exactly that - hype. At the
<br>
time, there was a complete absence of research that showed these
<br>
technologies (which are similar to the MS IIS etc. platform) reduce the
<br>
amount of effort one needed to expend to develop a product.  In fact, the
<br>
small set of work we examined indicated that these platforms INCREASE the
<br>
amount effort required.
<br>
<p>We'll be considering the change again this year, and am currently under the
<br>
impression that they've matured sufficiently to make the move worth our
<br>
while.  I'm 90% sure that if we'd listened to the hype and made the move
<br>
last year, we'd be regretting it still.
<br>
<p>Critical examination of the facts is a good habit to have in any endaveour,
<br>
whether Extropian or otherwise.
