<em>&gt; I fail to see such killing power. Much ado about nothing. Biotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warfare has been with us for centuries to no ill effect. The idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone being smart enough to build a universal assembler and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concurrently being dumb enough to not build it with sufficient controls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is nonsensical. Purely Pollyanish Paranoia Posing preposterously as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper public politics.
</em><br>
<p>I vaguely recall this same (or a similar) debate from a few years ago on
<br>
the extropy list. The theme of the dispute centers on the *potential* of
<br>
genetic engineering, nanotech, and robotics (as the consilience giants
<br>
among emerging technologies) to cause devastation and death of biblical
<br>
proportions. Some folks think we already have enough evidence to ascertain
<br>
that Homo sapiens will repeat the patterns of technological warfare of the
<br>
past, and that indicates we ought to relinquish development of these
<br>
technologies (the Bill Joy position). Others argue that relinquishment
<br>
amounts to neo-luddism and fear mongering.
<br>
<p>National policy and decision makers, if they consider these trends at all,
<br>
have not made their views public, as we might expect, given the sensitive
<br>
and secret nature of top level research involved. Without having access to
<br>
super computer modeling and experimentation (as well as related military
<br>
and university lab study) to help sort out a feasible plan, it makes no
<br>
sense to try to second guess the consequences of ultra-hi-tech weapons
<br>
deployment. All I know about these issues is what I've learned from
<br>
observing human nature first hand. That concerns me, because human nature,
<br>
not some yet-to-be-created alien intelligence, drives the development of
<br>
new technologies.
<br>
<p>If scientists finally relinquish G-N-R research and development, they may
<br>
turn it over to their Mind Children, Spiritual Machines, Artilects, and
<br>
Robo sapiens. I don't think that's what Bill Joy intends, and Harvey
<br>
Newstrom would accuse me of &quot;circular thinking&quot; here. If it were up to me,
<br>
I'd make everyone enlightened, illuminated Buddhas, so that we'd all live
<br>
in endlessly ecstatic superlative sentience. Since that ain't gonna
<br>
happen, and since we're all unenlightened biological washouts anyway, we
<br>
don't have anything to lose by betting everything on G-N-R.
<br>
<p>Full speed ahead!
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
