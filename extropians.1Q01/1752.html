In a message dated 1/19/01 2:08:31 PM Pacific Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:denis.bider@globera.com?Subject=Re:%20GUNS:%20Re:%20Self%20Defense&In-Reply-To=&lt;81.5bce966.279a37d7@aol.com&gt;">denis.bider@globera.com</a> writes:&lt;&lt; So, I don't think America's aversion 
<br>
against banning guns has any rational structure at all. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Denis,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this country the citizenry of the country have the power and the 
<br>
rights.  We gave specific rights to the central government.  They did not 
<br>
give rights to us as is normally done in other countries.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every person on this list is immediately qualified to become the 
<br>
leader of this nation.  Almost all of the remainder will be found to be 
<br>
disqualified only because they have not yet reached the age of qualification. 
<br>
&nbsp;Only a vanishing few on this list, mostly those that were born in other 
<br>
countries, will be permanently disqualified.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words this list is made up of the people that are the sovereigns 
<br>
of this nation and the central government has only those powers that we 
<br>
permit it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it does not end here.  In addition, one of the powers we hold to 
<br>
ourselves is the power to collectively throw out the entire executive and 
<br>
legislative branches of our government, if they do not please us, and install 
<br>
different ones on a periodic basis.  We went to great lengths to establish in 
<br>
law and custom means of doing this peacefully.  Further, we hold to the 
<br>
civilian side of our government and through them ourselves the right to be 
<br>
supreme over our military and police forces.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to get used to this idea.  I can't blame you if you 
<br>
don't immediately grasp all of the concepts at first exposure or if on 
<br>
occasion you relapse into old ways of thinking even after you do grasp the 
<br>
ideas behind our thinking.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But please understand that we shed a great deal of blood and lost many 
<br>
lives establishing this government and this country on the basis we prefer 
<br>
and when these arguments arise we ask ourselves one question: if we, the 
<br>
sovereigns of the nation, aren't allowed to defend ourselves and our nation 
<br>
then who has a better right?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you will permit me, I basically am a lurker in my ways.  I detest 
<br>
the endless debates on this subject and despise being caught up in them.  I 
<br>
would like to drop out of the debate at this point.  However if you wish to 
<br>
make any comments I will read them and probably will not reply.  As has been 
<br>
said many times; this list is not primarily about holding gun debates.
<br>
Ron h.
