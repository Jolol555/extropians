</em><br>
<em>&gt; nexus of change that I see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most potential danger, which is why I am cautious about pronouncing any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one action a solution.
</em><br>
<p>Since you admit that government, in reality, is merely a gang that uses
<br>
words to 'legitimize' itself. What you are saying is that you think that
<br>
in the absence of government, one or more groups will always vie to
<br>
'king' itself, as if government is a default mode of human existence,
<br>
especially monopoly government. Why is it so difficult for people to
<br>
grasp the concept of a competetive government services market? Most all
<br>
functions of government today were once performed on a competetive basis
<br>
(they became sociallized not necessarily due to classical natural
<br>
monopoly theory, for example, governments will tend to try to control or
<br>
regulate channels of communication and commerce not because trade and
<br>
communication are better conducted by a monopoly, but because
<br>
controlling those markets helps serve governments monopoly on the market
<br>
of force). Fire fighting, for example, is generally considered a
<br>
government function today, yet was conducted as a business for the vast
<br>
majority of human history. The Roman Consul, Crassus, rose up from plebe
<br>
caste status because he expanded the fire fighting company he used in
<br>
his construction business to provide fire fighting services to the
<br>
people of Rome. He would negotiate fees at the scene of the fire, and
<br>
subsequently became the largest landowner in Rome. Benjamin Franklin
<br>
founded a fire company in Philly, as another example, and even today in
<br>
rural areas, many communities rely on volunteer fire groups that pay for
<br>
their equipment by billing those who have fires or need rescue services.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Remove government's ability to do so, and corporations will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unable to victimize and abuse without just retribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems naive to me, but I honestly hope you are right.
</em><br>
<p>Its rather easy to understand: government currently limits the ability
<br>
of the individual to use force, while it places far fewer on
<br>
corporations. Corporations, for example, need no background check to be
<br>
done to buy machine guns.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The question with India is to ask if it is in better condition than if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the British had never dipped their hands in, no matter how selfishly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can either one of us decide this? Isn't this really only something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that each individual Indian can answer for him or herself?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in so far as India's society doesn't impact the rest of the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; All of the problems that India has, in my view, tend to be problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; caused by cultural practices remaining that predate the British era.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Left uninfluenced, India in my view would have currently become a rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nasty combination of Balkan politics and African chaos and brutality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, how can we really say? The deed (colonization) is already done,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the complex system we are left with is too slippery to get a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle on. Perhaps you're right about what would have happened to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; India if left uninfluenced, but since that cannot now happen, there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really no way to know. Maybe the individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that country could have solved their own problems. With the added
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burden of colonization to overcome,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not surprising at all that many of the old problems still remain.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you assume that colonization is a burden? The British provided a
<br>
significant level of industrialization, infrastructure development, and
<br>
political and legal training that didn't exist whatsoever prior to their
<br>
arrival. They ended slavery, wife burning, religious genocides, and
<br>
increased the agricultural yeild of the nation such that it no longer
<br>
suffers famines every 11 years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; However, I think its rather indicative that survive assimilation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; British colonized nations tend to be far more civil and humane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals than groups left to their own devices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you actually saying that people in colonized nations would be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil and humane if they had been left to their own devices? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That for some reason they aren't as &quot;well behaved&quot; as we are? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't want to believe it, but sometimes it really seems like you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are suggesting that some people (yourself, for example) can and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be left to their own devices but that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups of people (pre-colonial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indians, for example) should be colonized. Again, it sounds to me like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are defending imperialism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is a form of oppression and removes individuals' liberty. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to contradict your libertarian position.
</em><br>
<p>I think that everyone can and should be as free as possible. Many, IMHO,
<br>
would dutifully choose to reaccept their chains and socio-cultural
<br>
baggage rather than accept the responsibilities of individual liberty.
<br>
Most immigrants who come to the US these days couldn't give a fig about
<br>
the concept of individual liberty. They come to get a job or get on the
<br>
dole. They mouth the words of their oaths of citizenship then
<br>
immediately go about promoting ideas that directly contravene the
<br>
Constitution they have just sworn to protect and defend from all
<br>
enemies. 
<br>
<p>It is true that libertarian concepts of individual liberty are primarily
<br>
western european in nature. What is naive is, for example, to presume
<br>
that a country like, say, Russia, would just automatically pick up
<br>
western ideas of individual liberty and sovereignty, free markets, etc.
<br>
and not just twist them into a shape that allows traditional cultural
<br>
practices to continue under new names and faces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Most all of native american deaths occured during the Conquest period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when conquistadors were not only completely unaware of the cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; diseases that killed off millions of natives in virgin field epidemics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they were typically hundreds if not thousands of miles away from most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the deaths when they happened. Calling this genocide is like accusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some ancient Babylonian of genocide for playing with rats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since I never mentioned the Native American deaths that were due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epidemics, it seems odd you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring this up. Of course this isn't genocide, just a sad side-effect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an already bad situation. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; referring to the deaths that can be attributed to the direct actions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conquerors, and I would use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the term genocide for quite a number of specific incidents.
</em><br>
<p>Total the numbers and compare. Aztec society, and most Carribean
<br>
societies, regularly practiced slavery, human sacrifice, body
<br>
mutilation, and cannibalism. The level of accepted violence in the
<br>
conquered societies as a matter of every day ritual was at least as
<br>
severe as that practiced by eurpeans on them as a matter of systematized
<br>
policy. 
<br>
Most revisionists tend to try to count epidemic deaths in their blame
<br>
games when accusing europeans of 'genocide'. The fact is that one
<br>
quarter to 90 percent of local populations perished when exposed to
<br>
western diseases over a period of a few decades, long before anyone had
<br>
any idea of how disease was transmitted.
<br>
What conflict actually occured is more properly described as low level
<br>
warfare, with one side almost constantly losing (indeed, the first
<br>
British colonies in NA were under attack almost from the start).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Clinging to the idea of being humane versus inhumane. Its not all black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and white. Do you claim that Jefferson was an abominable criminal for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; owning slaves?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'm with you on the humane over inhumane idea. I'm glad to hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this. And I would never claim it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all black and white. Quite the contrary, which can be evidenced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at my other posts. Looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things only in black and white terms is one of the things I am objecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to here. Again, I think we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in agreement, but that you won't let go of your defense of imperialism.
</em><br>
<p>While you don't seem to be able to let go of the idea that in every
<br>
situation, leaving despotic and evil cultural practices in place
<br>
unmolested is better than educating and improving through nation
<br>
building efforts. Thats a rather black and white position you hold.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you believe that denying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals their liberty is wrong, why can't you say that imperialism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was wrong for doing this despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that centuries later we can point to some positive things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grew out of it? 
</em><br>
<p>Imperialism wasn't about denying individuals their liberty, it was about
<br>
transforming non-western societies so that they could appreciate the
<br>
concept of individual liberty more. Sometimes that involved conflict and
<br>
violence dealing with adherents of the old order who wanted to retain
<br>
their 'right' to continue to oppress their people. If you insist that
<br>
they have the right to oppress and be oppressed, then you must also
<br>
accept the idea that some cultures cannot become libertarian or
<br>
democratic, and that some people cannot appreciate individual liberty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for Jefferson,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, no, I wouldn't call him an &quot;abominable criminal.&quot; That's too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplistic. I prefer to honor him for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the good things he did, while at the same time recognizing that slavery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was wrong, he participated in it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is therefore responsible for his actions. He denied other human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings their liberty by owning them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was intelligent and educated enough to know it was wrong to do so, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet did it anyway. This doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make him an abominable criminal, especially when taking into account the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger culture in which this took place; it just makes him wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, 'taking into account the larger culture in which this took place'.
<br>
Damning the past from our own perceptions is a game that applies to all.
<br>
We could condemn the US for the idea of MAD, yet those doing the
<br>
condemning can think of no possible alternative that deals with
<br>
totalitarian socialists bent on world domination as well, just as,
<br>
ironically, they view concepts of Mutual Assured Survival as if defense
<br>
is not more moral than offense and that MAD (which the claim to despise)
<br>
is a better idea.
<br>
<p>I find it funny that leftists who claim to hate imperialism seem to
<br>
worship the idea of ancient Athens and its democracy, despite the fact
<br>
that Athens was an imperialist nation that dominated the Greek world
<br>
with its Navy, while the Sparta that leftists decry as militaristic, etc
<br>
was purposely structured to help avoid imperialism despite their
<br>
superiority in military arts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you feel the need to label me a communalist when I have never once claimed to be one? 
</em><br>
<p>Communists have always claimed to not be communists until they took
<br>
power. I judge by what you say and do, not by what you claim about
<br>
yourself. If you espouse concepts that are communistic, socialistic,
<br>
etc. then you label yourself. Revisionism, subjectivism, relativism, etc
<br>
are all propaganda tools of socialists and communists and are rather
<br>
indicative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You seem to cling to this idea, like many on the left, that government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is good and private individuals are prone to do evil things if left to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their own devices, so government of some sort is needed to save them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from their own corruption. This is crap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since I've not once made the claim that government is good and private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals are prone to do evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things if left to their own devices, I'm confused as to why you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say this. If you read my posts here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will not find this anywhere. This seems more like an empty retort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than an actual substantive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation. Why do you feel the need to respond this way? I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacking you. I'm merely trying to have a sincere discussion.
</em><br>
<p>So am I. You regularly (as many 'anarchist' socialists do), pay lip
<br>
service to opposition to government tyranny of the individual while
<br>
continually decrying corporate abuses of individuals and more
<br>
frequently, groups, despite the fact that governments abuse far more
<br>
people than corporations ever have. You regularly claim that abuses
<br>
committed by governments are actually just the governments being the
<br>
lackeys of corporations. This focus on corporations as if they are the
<br>
primary source of power is indicative of your primary orientation (and
<br>
that of 'anarchist' socialists in general). The gentleman who kicked me
<br>
off that anarchist list was responding to my posts that said that since
<br>
government is the nexus of the distribution of power that government
<br>
should be the primary focus of anarchists, and that if they focus on
<br>
eliminating government oppression, then corporate oppression will
<br>
subside as a result. Their refusal to accept this idea, and claims that
<br>
I am thus 'anti-capital' is rather indicative of their true motivation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I hope I am wrong in my impression of you, but it seems ludicrous to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that someone could claim that a group like a corporation, which has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inherent rights in and of itself, is more prone to commit evil acts than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some group like a government, which is duly delegated power by all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals in society, which is the body that empowers corporations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do the things they do. Anyone who feels thus can only logically do so if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they posess some innate distrust of the individual as an evil creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in need of restraint.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are wrong in your impression of me. Please read my posts more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully. I've never once said that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation is more prone to do evil, just that they can and sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do commit evil acts. 
</em><br>
<p>People can and sometimes do commit evil acts. Should we thus confiscate
<br>
all individual liberties? I didn't think so. Governments and
<br>
corporations are made up of people. They are both tools for
<br>
concentrating power. Governments concentrate more power than
<br>
corporations, and can concentrate it more absolutely, with no avenues of
<br>
appeal that they do not control. Portraying corporations as the greater
<br>
evil is thus disingenuous. I don't deny that any concentration of power
<br>
greater than that of an individual is more prone to abuse than that
<br>
likely from an individual with no more power than their own. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, this is always in collusion with whatever government in in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power. I'm just saying I'm not ready
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to totally blame government for all of our ills, any more than I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be willing to blame any one group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or cause. The world is a complex system, and we humans have made it even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more so. Thus I always try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at things from as many angles as possible, rather than trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fit what I see into any one ideological box.
</em><br>
<p>I don't blame government for all of our ills. Most of our individual
<br>
problems we heap upon ourselves. That is the bitter root of our liberty:
<br>
we are each free to choose our own miseries and their consequences.
<br>
Trying to protect people from the consequences of their actions does
<br>
nothing but build up a debt of consequences that are devastating when
<br>
they (and the accrued interest) come due.
<br>
<p>Life in general is caveat emptor. Refusing to accept this is as futile
<br>
as trying to refuse to accept gravity or e-mc^2. If you want to live a
<br>
better life, guess what? Its best done do-it-yourself.
