&gt; &gt; &gt; I think as long as we don't commit any crimes, we don't have so
&gt; &gt; much to concern us.

&gt; &gt; **Would that it were so.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The issue then is &quot;what is crime?&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; **Well, guess who decides? Not us. If I walk up to you and say,
&gt; &gt; &quot;Gimme a billion dollars or I'll slap your nasty face,&quot; that's a
&gt; &gt; felony.

&gt; I thought it was funny when the guy threw a cream pie at Bill Gates, but
&gt; it was a minor crime.  Gates could sue the guy and win for hundreds of
&gt; thousand of dollars, whereas that guy couldn't sue back by himself.
&gt; Gates could probably have the guy dealt with in a more severe manner.
