<p>Vector Develops Cigarette With Almost No Nicotine
<br>
By GORDON FAIRCLOUGH
<br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
<br>
<p><p>Tobacco-industry maverick Vector Group Ltd. has developed a cigarette made 
<br>
from genetically modified tobacco that contains virtually no nicotine.
<br>
<p>Vector, the parent company of tiny discount-cigarette maker Liggett Group, 
<br>
said it expects the new cigarettes, which could be used to wean people off 
<br>
smoking, to be on store shelves early next year.
<br>
<p>Bennett S. LeBow, Vector's chairman, said the new cigarette has the 
<br>
potential to disrupt the U.S. cigarette market. &quot;You capture market share, 
<br>
and you reduce the size of the market&quot; if people use it to quit, he said. 
<br>
&quot;It's a double-whammy product.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. LeBow has been a thorn in the side of Big Tobacco since the mid-1990s, 
<br>
when he broke ranks with the industry and agreed to settle lawsuits filed by 
<br>
state governments seeking to recoup the costs of caring for sick smokers.
<br>
<p>Vector's nicotine-free cigarettes are the latest entry in a high-stakes race 
<br>
among tobacco companies to develop potentially less-hazardous cigarettes. In 
<br>
this case, the cigarettes aren't addictive, so people theoretically would 
<br>
smoke less. Vector, of Miami, also says the absence of nicotine prevents the 
<br>
formation of cancer-causing chemicals called tobacco-specific nitrosamines, 
<br>
although the cigarettes would still contain dozens of other carcinogens.
<br>
<p>Other companies have focused on giving smokers the nicotine they crave, 
<br>
while trying to reduce the harmful chemicals that come with it in smoke. 
<br>
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., of Winston-Salem, N.C., for example, is 
<br>
selling its Eclipse cigarette, which primarily heats tobacco rather than 
<br>
burning it, while Star Scientific Inc., of Chester, Va., is test marketing 
<br>
Advance, a cigarette with reduced levels of nitrosamines.
<br>
<p>More than a decade ago, Philip Morris Cos., New York, the nation's largest 
<br>
cigarette maker, took nicotine out of regular tobacco using an extraction 
<br>
process similar to the one used to decaffeinate coffee. It started test 
<br>
marketing the very low nicotine cigarettes Next and Merit De-Nic in 1989, 
<br>
but pulled them about a year later, after smokers complained about the 
<br>
taste.
<br>
<p>Vector says the taste of its tobacco hasn't suffered. The reason, the 
<br>
company says, is that the tobacco leaves aren't treated. Rather, the plant 
<br>
has been genetically modified to prevent the formation of nicotine. Vector's 
<br>
Vector Tobacco unit owns the world-wide rights to a patented process devised 
<br>
by a former North Carolina State University geneticist who now works for 
<br>
Vector. The scientist, Mark Conkling, discovered a way to turn off a gene in 
<br>
a tobacco plant's roots and block the plant's ability to produce nicotine.
<br>
<p>Even if the cigarette tastes good, will smokers keep coming back if there is 
<br>
no nicotine &quot;buzz&quot;? The company certainly thinks there will be a substantial 
<br>
market for nonaddictive cigarettes. As evidence of potential demand, 
<br>
executives cite studies showing that about three-quarters of smokers say 
<br>
they would like to quit. Since Vector sells only about 1.5% of the 
<br>
cigarettes smoked in the U.S., capturing even a modest part of the market 
<br>
would translate into a big increase in sales for the company.
<br>
<p>Jed E. Rose, a neuroscientist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, 
<br>
N.C., who specializes in nicotine addiction, has been using Vector's new 
<br>
cigarettes in smoking-cessation studies. &quot;They show promise as a potential 
<br>
weaning tool to get smokers unhooked from their nicotine dependence,&quot; he 
<br>
said. Mr. Rose said that about half the participants in his study were able 
<br>
to switch from their regular cigarettes to Vector's very low-nicotine smokes 
<br>
and that some smokers kept using the low-nicotine cigarettes for the entire 
<br>
12-week duration of their part of the study.
<br>
<p>Vector said testing continues and it intends to seek approval from the Food 
<br>
and Drug Administration to sell the new cigarettes as a smoking-cessation 
<br>
aid. Until then, Vector said it can't advertise the product specifically as 
<br>
a tool to quit smoking and instead will focus on the theme of allowing 
<br>
smokers to smoke because they want to, not because they have to.
<br>
<p>Some public-health experts are critical of Vector's plans. &quot;If they want to 
<br>
put this out there as a bridge to cessation, they ought to do the right 
<br>
tests to prove that it will actually help,&quot; said John Slade, a physician who 
<br>
is director of the program on addictions at the School of Public Health of 
<br>
New Jersey, of New Brunswick, N.J.
