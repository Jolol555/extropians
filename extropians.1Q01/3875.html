</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why do you assume that colonization is a burden? The British provided a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant level of industrialization, infrastructure development, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political and legal training that didn't exist whatsoever prior to their

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increased the agricultural yeild of the nation such that it no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffers famines every 11 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, James Corbally's excellent response to the imperialism issue is pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the final word. Since neither you nor I have experienced colonization, we're both being pompous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant to think we can say anything valuable on the subject. Since you continue to try to speak for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least one group of conquered people, I can only assume you don't agree with this.
</em><br>
<p>This is so much crap, like 'only us black people can use the 'n' word'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think that everyone can and should be as free as possible. Many, IMHO, would dutifully choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reaccept their chains and socio-cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; baggage rather than accept the responsibilities of individual liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most immigrants who come to the US these days couldn't give a fig about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the concept of individual liberty. They come to get a job or get on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dole. They mouth the words of their oaths of citizenship then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immediately go about promoting ideas that directly contravene the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Constitution they have just sworn to protect and defend from all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enemies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since you can't honestly speak for everyone, this paragraph seems like a knee-jerk response to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and frankly, comes across as bigoted. If that's not your intention, I apologize.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on who you are accusing me of being bigoted against. Its funny
<br>
how you agreed entirely with Greg's commentary on the contrast between
<br>
low-trust and high-trust societies, but you can't accept what I am
<br>
saying despite it being the same thing.
<br>
<p>Now, are you claiming that I am making a blanket statement about all
<br>
immigrants? Thats not accurate. Some immigrants do this, and is the
<br>
primary cause of low-trust infiltration into our formerly high-trust
<br>
society. I am reminded of an incident reported in the press of a citizen
<br>
swearing in ceremony where a dutch woman was interviewed immediately
<br>
after swearing to 'protect and defend the constitution'. When asked what
<br>
she thought of America, she said she loved it, but 'we need to get rid
<br>
of the guns'. Excuse me? I still fail to see how this could not be
<br>
construed as breach of oath.
<br>
<p>This low-trust/high-trust dichotomy is the primary reason why many rural
<br>
people distrust immigrants and city dwellers: said immigrants and city
<br>
dwellers are, by continuous example, posessed of low-trust mindsets, and
<br>
therefore are treated as the low-trustworthy individuals that they are.
<br>
While this is stereotyping it is nevertheless real. Ever notice how city
<br>
people portray country people as gullible naive bumpkins? Its because
<br>
those country people are high-trust types who haven't had their bubbles
<br>
burst yet by big city cynicism and con games.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Total the numbers and compare. Aztec society, and most Carribean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; societies, regularly practiced slavery, human sacrifice, body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mutilation, and cannibalism. The level of accepted violence in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conquered societies as a matter of every day ritual was at least as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; severe as that practiced by eurpeans on them as a matter of systematized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if we conquer these people and make them our slaves, it's okay because they're terrible anyway?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Talk about crap. How about letting people decide their own fates? This, to me, is what liberty is all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about. It doesn't mean you or I have to like or accept their way of doing things, just that we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to let them work out their own destinies. How would you like it if someone who disapproved of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of life were to conquer you &quot;for your own good&quot;? Think about what you're saying here. Try to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond your own biases.
</em><br>
<p>My own biases are that I like to maximize individual liberty for myself
<br>
and others. Its already a fact that there are millions and billions of
<br>
people in this world who want to conquer me for my own good, and who
<br>
consider me a wacked out right wing nutjob because I believe in my right
<br>
to defend myself. They are hard at work at it every day. They don't seem
<br>
to think that this is in any way 'cultural imperialism' because they see
<br>
it as a good thing to take my guns away from me. My analysis of this
<br>
situation is that the low-trust societies are winning, and their
<br>
low-trust ideas are ever more prevalent in American society, especially
<br>
in the big cities. Therefore I regard it as entirely proper for me to
<br>
use any and all means. Now, exchange 'my guns' with the technology of
<br>
your choice. The primary promulgators of anti-technology and
<br>
anti-individual liberty cultural imperialism are the same people who yap
<br>
on and on about cultural imperialism against any French or non-western
<br>
european culture: They are Greens. Wake up and smell the napalm. A
<br>
'balanced approach' won't cut it, as I've shown. They are not interested
<br>
in compromise, in cutting a deal, in being 'balanced'. He who sits on a
<br>
fence winds up nailed to a cross of fenceposts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Most revisionists tend to try to count epidemic deaths in their blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; games when accusing europeans of 'genocide'. The fact is that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quarter to 90 percent of local populations perished when exposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; western diseases over a period of a few decades, long before anyone had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any idea of how disease was transmitted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What conflict actually occured is more properly described as low level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; warfare, with one side almost constantly losing (indeed, the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; British colonies in NA were under attack almost from the start).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And why was there warfare? Because an outside group came in and tried to take over their land.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wouldn't your response to this be the same? Wouldn't you fight the intruders?
</em><br>
<p>Yes I would have. Warfare is not, however, genocide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I'm with you on the humane over inhumane idea. I'm glad to hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; this. And I would never claim it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; all black and white. Quite the contrary, which can be evidenced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; looking at my other posts. Looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; things only in black and white terms is one of the things I am objecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to here. Again, I think we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in agreement, but that you won't let go of your defense of imperialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; While you don't seem to be able to let go of the idea that in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; situation, leaving despotic and evil cultural practices in place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unmolested is better than educating and improving through nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; building efforts. Thats a rather black and white position you hold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, Michael. Try to focus here. In the quote from me above, I say that I would never claim it's all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black and white and that, in fact, this B&amp;W way of looking at things is one of the things I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objecting to here. Then you go right on accusing me of having a black and white position. Am I not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing clear sentences here? I believe we speak the same language. And another thing, where exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do I say that &quot;leaving despotic and evil cultural practices in place unmolested is better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educating and improving through nation building efforts&quot;? Nowhere. 
</em><br>
<p>I quote:
<br>
&quot;To claim that's it was okay for one group to conquer another because
<br>
they're not quite as bad is ludicrous. Aren't all forms of oppression
<br>
wrong? We see to be agreeing here, but I feel like you're clinging to
<br>
something.&quot;
<br>
<p>Its all a matter of creating a greater good by choosing the lesser of
<br>
two evils over time. Would killing more Germans during WWI using more
<br>
terror weapons have possibly prevented WWII by killing the key Nazis,
<br>
and thus saved 50 million lives? 
<br>
<p>Had Lincoln lost his presidential election the South would have kept
<br>
millions of slaves in bondage and repression for another decade or more,
<br>
and the 'cultural imperialism' of the North would not have decimated the
<br>
practices of the genteel ante-bellum South. If we are to take a
<br>
'balanced approach' as you claim, how can you justify the decimation of
<br>
the South and the killing of 300,000 people in a war to forcibly end a
<br>
cultural practice that was perfectly legal in the states which legally
<br>
and Constitutionally chose to secede from the Union? Far more people
<br>
were killed or disabled in the War than were freed by the Emancipation
<br>
Proclamation, and Lincoln's goal of bringing the South back into the
<br>
Union was in contravention to the US Constitution's own basis. If you
<br>
are going to condemn imperialism, then what do you have to say about
<br>
this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please do not put words in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mouth. All I have ever contended in regard to this (now rather tiresome) subject is that acts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppression cannot be justified in this way. Taking away someone's (or some group's, or some nation's)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberty is wrong. Period. I don't care what positive outcomes can be pointed to centuries later by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apologists. If we are going to take the position that denying someone's liberty is wrong, then how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can you continue rationlizing colonization and imperialism? This does not compute. Even if you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to call imperialism &quot;nation building efforts.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>See above...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Imperialism wasn't about denying individuals their liberty, it was about transforming non-western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; societies so that they could appreciate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concept of individual liberty more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh please, give me a break. This is just more rationalization through hindsight. Why can't you, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-proclaimed advocate of liberty and self-determination, see how specious an argument this is?
</em><br>
<p>It worked in the Civil War, the Spanish American War, WWII, and the Cold
<br>
War.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sometimes that involved conflict and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; violence dealing with adherents of the old order who wanted to retain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their 'right' to continue to oppress their people. If you insist that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they have the right to oppress and be oppressed, then you must also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accept the idea that some cultures cannot become libertarian or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; democratic, and that some people cannot appreciate individual liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again (yawn), I'm not saying this. Please don't put words in my mouth.
</em><br>
<p>Its a rational logical extension of your claims. Explain yourself or
<br>
concede the point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, 'taking into account the larger culture in which this took place'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Damning the past from our own perceptions is a game that applies to all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not doing this. I'm saying that even though Jefferson was wrong to own slaves, his actions can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only be understood in the broader cultural context of his day. In his society, slave-owning was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptible and &quot;normal,&quot; and only changed when enough of his contemporaries (and later generations)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked to affect a change. This doesn't make his actions any less wrong, it simply provides a context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which we can look at the situation critically rather than just damning him from our (more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightened) perspective.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I find it funny that leftists who claim to hate imperialism seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worship the idea of ancient Athens and its democracy, despite the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that Athens was an imperialist nation that dominated the Greek world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with its Navy, while the Sparta that leftists decry as militaristic, etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was purposely structured to help avoid imperialism despite their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superiority in military arts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm. Where did this come from? Since I have neither claimed to be a leftist, or mentioned ancient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Athens, I'm wondering why you threw this in. By the way, I agree with your assessment.
</em><br>
<p>Well thats a switch. Not going to become an Athenian apologist?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Why do you feel the need to label me a communalist when I have never once claimed to be one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Communists have always claimed to not be communists until they took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power. I judge by what you say and do, not by what you claim about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yourself. If you espouse concepts that are communistic, socialistic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc. then you label yourself. Revisionism, subjectivism, relativism, etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are all propaganda tools of socialists and communists and are rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indicative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, I see. I'm a communist because you say I am, even though I repeatedly tell you I'm not.
</em><br>
<p>If you are really not I apologize, however you are being way too much of
<br>
an apologist for their standpoints  and propaganda memes for me to not
<br>
consider the issue. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak and embarrassing way to conduct a discussion, and seriously undermines your credibility. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just because certain rhetorical techniques are abused as tools of propaganda (which we all engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the time, by the way, including you) by certain groups, 
</em><br>
<p>Correction: were invented by certain groups as tools of propaganda. I
<br>
suppose zyklon B, in the hands of a responsible exterminator, is just
<br>
dandy for termites, it's just an abused, misunderstood poison that
<br>
suffers from the revisionistic cultural imperialism of the Allies.... I
<br>
hope you are intelligent enough to comprehend irony...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it doesn't mean that anyone who uses them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AT ALL is somehow (unknown to themselves) a member of said group. This is ridiculous, and is the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of useless labeling I will continue to call you on. Oh, and I'm not interested in &quot;taking power&quot; over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything except my own life.
</em><br>
<p>Then stop making excuses for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So am I. You regularly (as many 'anarchist' socialists do), pay lip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; service to opposition to government tyranny of the individual while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; continually decrying corporate abuses of individuals and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; frequently, groups, despite the fact that governments abuse far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people than corporations ever have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, so now I'm an &quot;anarchist socialist&quot;? Geez, make up your mind. And again, you totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misunderstand and misrepresent what I said. I have clearly and repeatedly decried tyranny of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds, not just that perpetrated by governments or corporations. Is this too clear for you?
</em><br>
<p>Then why have you been continually bringing up corporations?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You regularly claim that abuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; committed by governments are actually just the governments being the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lackeys of corporations. This focus on corporations as if they are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; primary source of power is indicative of your primary orientation (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that of 'anarchist' socialists in general).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I have never said this. Why do you feel the need to make me into something I'm not? If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need an enemy that fits this description, look elsewhere. All I have ever claimed in regard to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter is that corporations have and do commit acts of oppression, but ALWAYS in collusion with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments. And I have repeatedly said that I am interested in looking at all factors, not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blaming one group or another. Again, is this too subtle?
</em><br>
<p>You have, at best, now that you have been called out, trying to portray
<br>
corporations and governments as equally evil. History demonstrates that
<br>
corporations are a speck of a pustule on the back of the history of
<br>
government oppression of the individual. Ok, who is more evil: a person
<br>
who kills one person so he can feed his family, or a person who kills
<br>
1000 people just because its fun (especially when they beg)? Time to
<br>
make actual DECISIONS here Neal. Pick a side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People can and sometimes do commit evil acts. Should we thus confiscate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all individual liberties?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Portraying corporations as the greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evil is thus disingenuous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I never said this.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, portraying corporations as equally evil when governments commit the
<br>
vast majority of evil acts is thus disengenuous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't deny that any concentration of power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greater than that of an individual is more prone to abuse than that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely from an individual with no more power than their own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm glad we agree on this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Trying to protect people from the consequences of their actions does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing but build up a debt of consequences that are devastating when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they (and the accrued interest) come due.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Life in general is caveat emptor. Refusing to accept this is as futile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as trying to refuse to accept gravity or e-mc^2. If you want to live a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better life, guess what? Its best done do-it-yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with you on this, and have never indicated otherwise. All I am calling for is a balanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach to examining the problems we are discussing here, one that doesn't resort to name-calling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labeling or rigidly adhering to any one ideology. If this seems to fit your description of a leftist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a communist, or an anarchist, well, whatever. I prefer to think of myself as someone who tries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think outside the box. Call me eclectic.
</em><br>
<p>Thinking is fine, Neal. At some point you have to make a decision,
<br>
though, or your thinking isn't worth spit. Because liberty and
<br>
oppression always seem to come in shades of grey, you can't always make
<br>
a decision that will result in no oppression at all. Somebody is gonna
<br>
think they got shafted, whether they did or not. There were plenty of
<br>
Indian men who feel they got shafted when the British said,&quot;You have the
<br>
cultural tradition of burning women, just as we have the cultural
<br>
tradition of hanging men who burn women.&quot; That isn't 'imperialism'. The
<br>
world isn't perfect that way. Deciding then that all decisions are
<br>
equally bad is wrong.
