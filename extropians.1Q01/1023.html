<p>Residential local service was always subsidized by long distance
<br>
charges. Now that interstate long distance companies are free of this,
<br>
your residential local service is subsidized by in-state long distance,
<br>
which still ranges from $0.20-0.39 /minute, which kinda stinks if your
<br>
computer gets smart and decides to call an in-state long distance number
<br>
for your internet access if it can't get through locally... or if the
<br>
ISP gives you a number claiming its local when its not (they got me that
<br>
way last year: $1200 in a month before I got my bill...)
<br>
<p>I say jack up the prices, make people pay for what they are getting,
<br>
then they'll demand something better, and someone will be willing to
<br>
give it to them.
