<p>Yes, _very_ true. And, contrariwise, attacks are not the only sign of
<br>
extremism, any more than workplace shootings are the only sign of an
<br>
utterly unhappy worker. But not all extremists, it seems to me, attack
<br>
directly. Some attack indirectly. 
<br>
<p>That was the source of my question about Morris. Since you've mentioned
<br>
he is a relative, I'd sincerely like to know more about him from you
<br>
some time.
<br>
<p>What's he like? How often do you and he come into contact?
