Why not just urinate on someone, what the harm in that?

<p>Because then it *isn't* a purposefully harmless prank.
<br>
<p>Look, the whole idea of the pie-in-the-face is that it's meant to be
<br>
non-damaging. If it causes injury, or infection with a nasty strain of
<br>
gut-rot, then it undermines its own purpose. You might as well ask &quot;why
<br>
not embed a hand grenade in the pie?&quot; Answer: because then it wouldn't
<br>
be an overtly harmless insult any more, and we're back to talking about
<br>
people making political points by shooting at each other.
<br>
<p>Can you cope with people mocking you publicly, if they don't lay so much
<br>
as an air molecule on your person?
