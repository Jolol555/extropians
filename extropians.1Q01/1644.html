<em>&gt; I think you're being too critical of Eliezer's explanation for changing his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimate to 2008.  As I recall the conversation, Eli said he'd revised his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal projection about how soon the Singularity was likely to occur and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else asked him what his reasons were.  This is very different from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking him to defend his projection or to convince anyone else of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer listed his reasons, and I took them in that spirit: they might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tentative conclusions, they might be based on private information, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be intended as conservative guesses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Asking (seemed like demanding to me) him to come up with schedules and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; budgets in order to convince you goes beyond what he offered.  If you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ask if he can defend those beliefs, you'd be on more solid ground.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, personally I think very strong claims or projections of what is
<br>
coming when, especially the Singularity coming that soon, require a bit
<br>
of evidence before being taken seriously.  
<br>
<p>Also, I have heard a lot about this SI and I want very much to know that
<br>
it is moving solidly as a project and piece of work.  My interest is not
<br>
idle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That said, I agree with you that some of his reasoning seems speculative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and optimistic at best.  But given  point 4:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I stopped thinking in terms of &quot;What is the precise degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ludicrousness involved in the thought of my ever getting a cent from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Social Security?&quot; and shifted to &quot;When do I need to do something if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to do it before the Singularity?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have trouble debating the whole argument.  What's your *conservative*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimate of when you need to finish up any major projects if they should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done before the singularity?  What if you felt as strongly as Eliezer does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's crucial that you win the race?
</em><br>
<p><p>If I felt that strongly that it was critical I &quot;win the race&quot; or that
<br>
the SI comes first and has certain characteristics then  I would be out
<br>
actively recruiting and sharing more working plans and projects.  So
<br>
far, I haven't seen this.  A project of this magnitude that is
<br>
supposedly going to deliver this major a result in a mere 7 years really
<br>
needs this level of information flow if it is to be counted on.  I am a
<br>
software engineer.  So I look for the engineering when I hear
<br>
projections like this.
