</em><br>
<p>I must admit, MS is behaving like a company flailing around in panic; eg:
<br>
getting into half a dozen new businesses in which it has little experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; world coding, you very rarely get to choose your tools; they are part of

the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; initial parameter set.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but you can choose your employers or clients, if you're a contractor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only for the compensation, but for a) satisfaction it gives you b)
</em><br>
building
<br>
<em>&gt; skills for the future c) by steering the marketplace by concerted action
</em><br>
(if
<br>
<em>&gt; you've got religion).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; If a client dictates you use of broken tools with zero flexibility,
</em><br>
perhaps
<br>
<em>&gt; he's not the right client for you. Unless you absolutely, positively need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that contract, or you go broke.
</em><br>
<p>Too true. You have to decide if you want to work that way. When clients get
<br>
like that, the only way to respond is to say &quot;Yessir&quot;, cobble along with
<br>
what you are given, and prepare to move along.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I highly recommend ASP, on IIS, with SQL Server backend, as a good
</em><br>
starting
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; set of employable skills. I'm currently working using this set of
</em><br>
products,
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are many employable skills right now. SAP, Oracle, Java. (Though I
</em><br>
wonder
<br>
<em>&gt; how long it takes until the Java backlash will begin. Or until the damn
</em><br>
thing
<br>
<em>&gt; matures, it is taking it's sweet time).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In Oz (don't know about the US), Java spent all last year taking off in a
<br>
big way; for instance, the demand for coders increased steadily and
<br>
dramatically, while in comparison demand for C &amp; VB coders remained flat.
<br>
<p>How is Java to use these days? I dabbled in it a few years ago, and had to
<br>
retreat due to multiple injuries. What a painful experience!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; with the caveat that the same products must also support Oracle, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; caveat that javascript is used for ASP programming rather than VBScript,
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very sound choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, I choose cholera over plague every time.
</em><br>
<p>(still laughing)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some of the purists will come out of the woodwork and attack me for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viewpoint. It does sound like a banal and colourless life. Don't be
</em><br>
fooled;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope, you're paying your bills and having fun in the prospect. No point in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruining all this by getting religion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the mainstream technology is not only rewarding in a financial sense,
</em><br>
it's
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fun. It's fun because it keeps changing at a crazy pace. When you've got
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, unfortunately it doesn't go anywhere particular. It looks rather
</em><br>
brownian,
<br>
<em>&gt; one step forwards, two back, one sideways, one forward, iterate. I like
</em><br>
change
<br>
<em>&gt; a lot, but I like change with a purpose even more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite agree with this. For instance, going purely MS, you can't
<br>
compare the world of 10 years ago to that of today. It does move forward,
<br>
overall. It just does so in a fairly erratic way; looks kind of like natural
<br>
selection rather than intelligent design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; most of the coders, and most of the install base, you can afford to put
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lot of effort into development. This means things are rarely ever the
</em><br>
same,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which is damned hard, but always interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which means you have to have the proper personality structure to
</em><br>
appreciate it.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Like being a bit broken in the brain, perhaps; I admit it.
<br>
<p>It compares I think to the zealot mind, where one latches onto a narrow set
<br>
of tools/technologies, decides they are the be all and end all, and defends
<br>
them till death. Or until one finds oneself fossilised, supporting what
<br>
inevitably have become legacy systems in the least progressive
<br>
organisations, staggering on toward retrenchment/retirement. Pray/prey for
<br>
the spike...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Note also; I've had a lot of jobs, and never used even similar sets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skills/languages from one job to the next; the primary language to use,
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instance, has always been entirely new to me. That's not uncommon. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but the opposite is also true. A good C programmer under Unix has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an employable history of almost three decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But maybe not for three decades to come.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; there's no need to get cut up on becoming a specialist in language X or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; database Y. Just get really good at learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good advice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm toying with where to start studying next. I've got an inkling that
<br>
getting stuck into biochemistry/microbiology might not be a bad direction.
