<p>
I'll toss a couple of cents worth in on this discussion.
<br>
<p>The claims made by Hayflick are based on work done by
<br>
James Fries.  The relevant references are contained in the list:
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/Aging/Authors/fries-jf/">http://www.aeiveos.com/Aging/Authors/fries-jf/</a>
<br>
<p>The comments regarding why we age and some of the things
<br>
we need to focus on are pretty much on the money.  People
<br>
on the list should pat themselves on the back since this
<br>
is stuff the average practicing physician or molecular
<br>
biologist will not get right.
<br>
<p>I'm dubious regarding what the study of tortises might
<br>
tell us due to the fact that they don't maintain a high
<br>
body temperature constantly, so their rate of damage
<br>
accumulation may be lower.  You want to study elephants,
<br>
whales and long-lived birds.  Ultimately they have each
<br>
solved different parts of the problem in different ways.
<br>
(Of course going back at some point and studying tortises
<br>
will be useful, but it isn't something likely to contribute
<br>
to the retardation of human aging soon.)
<br>
<p>The topic is getting more discussion, from the bet being
<br>
made between Austad and Olshansky, see:
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;[Use something like <a href="mailto:nobody@nowhere.com?Subject=Re:%20Hayflick%20and%20others%20deny%20major%20life%20expectancy%20improvements&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.UW2.4.20.0102200827440.23027-100000@www.aeiveos.com&gt;">nobody@nowhere.com</a> if you don't want to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cough up a real password...]
<br>
<p>They are both wrong, but they don't understand the technologies
<br>
we will have, so they can be excused.
<br>
<p>The topic is even getting, &quot;serious, conservative&quot; scientists like
<br>
Francis Collins (director of the NHGRI @ NIH) to forsee:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ten years after that, by 2030 we will have cataloged all the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genes invoolved in ageing... and clinical trials to extend
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the human lifespan could be underway.  A full computer model
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the human cell will replace many lab experiments.  And
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complete genomic sequencing of the individual will be routine,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;costing less than $1,000.&quot;
<br>
also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There'll be serious debate about the notion of taking charge of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our own evolution.  It'll be a very noisy and vigorous debate.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Genetic Engineering News 21(3):22, Feb 1, 2001
<br>
<p>Of course, Dr. Collis is a bit pessimistic with regard to when
<br>
we will understand the genes that directly &quot;contribute&quot; to aging
<br>
(those that are plieotropic in nature), but perhaps optimistic
<br>
with regard to our understanding those errors in the genetic
<br>
program that are simply &quot;missing&quot; (e.g. the anti-cancer program
<br>
that whales or elephants might possess).
<br>
<p>A reporter from Italy asked Robert Freitas about the implications of
<br>
the publishing of the genome information on &quot;nanomedicine&quot; and he
<br>
forwarded part of his commentary to me.  I subsequently commented
<br>
to the reporter, regarding the &quot;pre-diamondoid&quot; bio-nanotech path
<br>
as follows:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is the logical progression of what will develop: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) We will begin to understand the function of all of the genes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) We will associate thousands of known human genetic defects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     with single or a few interacting genes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (c) We will develop gene therapies (or drugs) that can mitigate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     or correct those defects, first for single genes, then for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     multiple genes.  (Note the tradeoffs -- drugs you may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to take the rest of your life, while a gene therapy may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     provide a &quot;permanent&quot; fix, similar to a vaccine).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (d) We will understand the defects in the genetic program that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     result in aging, and develop interventions in those.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e) We will develop an entirely new discipline of &quot;genome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     engineering&quot; that allows us to design machines that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     assemble themselves (like plants) that do everything from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     manufacture fuel to cleanup the environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (f) We will develop cells with artificial genomes that allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     us to grow (inexpensively!) replacement organs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     can replace old and worn out organs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (g) We may be able to get to the point where we have artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     genomes in cells that can be put into your body that gradually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     grow into new organs while removing the tissue of the old organ.
</em><br>
<p>(The &quot;We&quot; is the biomedical research community in its entirety.)
<br>
<p>I think we get (a-f) at an increasing rate over the next 20 years.
<br>
With regard to (g), I put that as the hardest thing to accomplish
<br>
with the tools biology provides for us.  Though the functions needed
<br>
for this are found in Nature, they are rarely assembled into
<br>
a functional system that works this way (unless you want to cite
<br>
something like the caterpillar turning into a butterfly).
<br>
<p>Now, I'll give you one example of the synergism I expect to see
<br>
over the next decade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Nature Genetics 27:209-217, T. LaVaute et al, &quot;Targeted
</em><br>
deletion of the gene encoding iron regulatory protein-2 causes
<br>
misregulation of iron metabolism and neurodegenerative disease
<br>
in mice.&quot;
<br>
<p>The bottom line of this article is -- lose control of your iron
<br>
and you get neurodegeneration.  So a single gene knockout in mice
<br>
gives us critical insights into aspects of the genetic program
<br>
where we would want to look for polymorphisms, for &quot;stricter&quot; or
<br>
&quot;relaxed&quot; iron regulation, that contribute to neural degeneration.
<br>
Using the millions of polymorphisms that are now known will allow
<br>
organizations with large patient populations (e.g. HMOs) to construct
<br>
databases of genomic information to rapidly associate the clinical
<br>
health with probable causes.  This then leads to mitigating therapies
<br>
(e.g. chelation).  Ultimately one may want to get to the point where
<br>
we are genetically engineered to manufacture our own chelating agents
<br>
if our iron levels get too high.  (For example, if garlic turns out
<br>
to be a natural chelator, one borrows the genetic pathway for that
<br>
and figures out how to put it into humans...  Interesting concept,
<br>
you are always able to tell when the 100+ people walk into the room...).
<br>
<p>Now, I can't tell whether we have the resources to knock out all
<br>
30,000 genes (or the 140,000 down-stream splice variants), but
<br>
I suspect that most of the major genes that people suspect to
<br>
be involved in aging (oxidative stress, iron regulation, glycosylation
<br>
lipofuscin accumulation, telomere shortening, cell scenescence,
<br>
DNA damage inducing apoptosis, DNA repair, etc.) are going to get
<br>
*lots* of attention.  We are going to know a lot in 10 years that
<br>
we don't have clues about now.
