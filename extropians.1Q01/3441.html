<em>&gt;How about the wrong vehicle color? I've been pulled over more with my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;red Cherokee (with gold trim) than I have with any other car besides an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;old beater I had that looked like a pot-head-mobile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Profiling by vehicle is an easy way to get around racial profiling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because drug dealers, for example, tend to exhibit a specific sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taste in car decor (crack dealers like gold trim and tinted windows,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pot-heads like VW's with phish or GD stickers, etc).
</em><br>
<p>Reminds me of something I saw in Virginia last year when shopping.  In the 
<br>
parking lot was a blue car (no idea of the make/model).  It had a Christian 
<br>
fish swallowing a Darwin fish.

<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
