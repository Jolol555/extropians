<em>&gt;I was referring to the population of the world when I said most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people spend the majority of their time doing things they don't want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be doing.  I've never been to China or India, but I've known 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people from both places. From what they tell me and from what I've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;read, it seems that the majority of the people there spend more time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;working than people in the US and most of the work is pretty tiring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and definitely not what you'd call fun or uplifting.
</em><br>
<p>Don't completely trust people who live in a country to give you an 
<br>
objective opinion.  I spent several months working in India about 6 
<br>
years back, and I have a completely opposite opinion of the work 
<br>
ethic there.
<br>
<p>During my time in Hyderabad (large city toward the center of India), 
<br>
I had a chance to observe a number of different classes of people in 
<br>
their day-to-day lives.
<br>
<p>My fellow Americans and I were absolutely astounded at the milling 
<br>
around going on.  You'd see large groups of the same men standing 
<br>
around for hours during the day.  At first, I thought the men 
<br>
standing outside my window on the side of the road were waiting for a 
<br>
bus or something, but soon, it became apparent that these guys were 
<br>
just hanging out shooting the breeze.  This was day after day, 
<br>
everywhere we went.  I'm not talking about one or two guys hanging 
<br>
out on an isolated corner, I'm talking about clumps of dozens all up 
<br>
and down the roads.
<br>
<p>The engineers in our office were better, although I was a bit 
<br>
surprised at the lack of drive and enthusiasm.  We were a successful 
<br>
American startup with Indian ownership, so we had good funding and 
<br>
lots of &quot;connections&quot; to locals who could find good people, 
<br>
equipment, etc.  We had lots of modern workstations, tons of 
<br>
documentation, a good Internet connection, and we let our engineers 
<br>
know that we were more than willing to allow them after-hours and 
<br>
weekend use of the computers for their own projects.  The 
<br>
universities that these guys attended had old crappy computers that 
<br>
they could only get access to for a couple of hours a week.  We were 
<br>
offering them a technological playground, and making ourselves 
<br>
available to teach them anything they wanted to learn.
<br>
<p>They couldn't have cared less.  For the most part, they came in, 
<br>
worked their hours, then went home.
<br>
<p>The only time we noticed any kind of dedication to work was with the women.
<br>
While the men were milling around talking, you'd see women going 
<br>
about their duties - usually labor-intensive work, like sweeping 
<br>
dirty streets with small straw brooms or scrubbing floors with rags. 
<br>
Whenever a woman wasn't actually working, you could see that she was 
<br>
going somewhere.  You rarely saw a group of women just standing 
<br>
around flapping their gums.
<br>
<p>My boss (who spent two years there) was at a construction site, where 
<br>
they were laying some bricks on the fourth floor.  The people 
<br>
carrying the bricks up the stairs were women - they had them stacked 
<br>
upon their heads.  Up where the bricks were being laid were about 5 
<br>
times as many men as were needed to do the job, so the ones not 
<br>
actually laying the bricks were just standing around talking.  My 
<br>
boss said, &quot;Why are the women carrying all these bricks and the men 
<br>
are laying them or just standing around?&quot;
<br>
<p>The response was, &quot;Well, laying the bricks is 'skilled' labor.&quot;  It's 
<br>
really hard to keep a straight face in that country.  The real reason 
<br>
was that they have a comfortable little male-dominated society, and 
<br>
they weren't interested in rocking their lazy-ass boat.
<br>
<p>I could spend days detailing my experiences there and those of my 
<br>
coworkers, but suffice it to say that India's problems aren't some 
<br>
big magical mystery.  They're not just the fault of their government 
<br>
or their large population or the evil Western World.  It's a failure 
<br>
of the individuals of their society who embrace a culture of 
<br>
ignorance, corruption, and getting the &quot;other guy&quot; to do their work 
<br>
for them.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
