<p>AMEN.  One of the few things that makes the commute tolerable is pushing
<br>
past the speed limits wherever you can safely and without getting a
<br>
traffic nannie on your tail.  If they are going to make card that
<br>
enforce their asinine speed limits then they can jolly well make the
<br>
damn rolling box drive itself so I can do more productive things during
<br>
my commute.  I don't see anywhere that says that random bureaucrats have
<br>
the right to bore me to tears for n hours of the day.
<br>
<p>Speaking of getting bored driving, has anyone here seen a system or
<br>
rolled your own that does good email/web surfing by voice?  By good I
<br>
mean that it also does voice to speech so I can reply with text rather
<br>
than voice messages.  I have seen companies that let me reply with a
<br>
voice mail.
