Well, you know, I hate to wax realistic on you--but at the moment, 
<br>
this is not bogus; this is reality--and cyborgish humans are bogus. 
<br>
Reality has its drawbacks.

&gt; &gt; But, see, this is the problem--what's okay for them ain't okay for
&gt; &gt; you and me. Case in point: Cops in many jurisdictions are now wearing
&gt; &gt; mics on traffic stops. Some are wearing cameras, in addition to the
&gt; &gt; dash-mounted cams. Guy in MA, I believe it was, audio-recorded the
&gt; &gt; cops stopping him and brought it up in court to support his
&gt; &gt; contention that he was harassed. Result? He was convicted of
&gt; &gt; illegally recording the cops. Last I heard, the officers were also
&gt; &gt; considering civil suits.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This will increasingly not hold up as citizens become more cyborgish.
&gt; There is little difference recording something in your head for your own
&gt; use where you can't prove there weren't areas and can't easily share it
&gt; or perfectly recall it and using better tech that you can perfectly
&gt; replay (more or less) and share.  Are the courts going to effectively
&gt; insist on lobotomizing cyber-intensive citizens?  This is bogus.
