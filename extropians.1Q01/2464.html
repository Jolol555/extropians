<p>
I'm not sure whether to send this personally to Chris or to the list, or 
<br>
possibly not to reply at all, since Chris and I seem to be miles apart in 
<br>
our philosophy on child rearing. I probably won't post any more on the 
<br>
topic unless there's evidence of general interest in the topic, but again, 
<br>
I'd refer anyone who's interested in non-coercive human relationships to 
<br>
take a look at Sarah Lawrence's web site.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Why would you say that I &quot;wish&quot; them upon my child...
</em><br>
<p>Because you said your child needed hard realities, and it's common to wish 
<br>
for one's child's needs to be fulfilled.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;I dare say that I love my child every bit as much as I'm sure you love 
</em><br>
yours, so let's avoid maligning each others' motives, okay?
<br>
<p>I'm assuming you love your child. I think you're mistaken, not evil.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt;Do you think that people who believe in using discipline do so to make 
</em><br>
their children's lives more difficult?
<br>
<p>Sometimes parents appear to have less than helpful motives, but generally I 
<br>
think parents use discipline as a teaching aid, with the best of intentions.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;Maybe out of some sort of sadistic impulse?
</em><br>
<p>(NOTE: none of the below applies to you, Chris, or anyone else on this 
<br>
list. Just observations I've made.)
<br>
<p>Sometimes this appears to be so. Aside from really terrible 
<br>
beating/permanent injury cases, emotional scars seem to be the worst. 
<br>
Thinking of a particular kid I know who's now a teenager and has attempted 
<br>
suicide--when he was little he loved to draw and paint; he found joy in 
<br>
using his sense of sight. His father wanted to use discipline in the form 
<br>
of emotional coercion to make the kid learn to be a different sort of 
<br>
person. It seemed sadistic to me, but I don't think the father would have 
<br>
seen it the same way.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember once when this kid was 8 years old I went for a walk with him, 
<br>
and we explored an abandoned building that had started out as a hotel 
<br>
during the cattle boom of the late 1860's and had later been used as an 
<br>
office building. Pigeons and bats had taken over the upper floors, gaining 
<br>
access through holes in the roof. It was a visually interesting place 
<br>
because of the juxtaposition of architectural elements (human and animal) 
<br>
reflecting the building's various uses over the years. We spent quite a 
<br>
while wandering around, calling each other's attention to wonderful sights. 
<br>
As we were leaving, the kid stopped, looked back and said, &quot;I wish life 
<br>
could always be like this.&quot; There was such longing in his voice.
<br>
<p>Poor kid, his father wanted him to be a regular guy and go out for sports. 
<br>
The kid tried hard, put up posters of basketball and hockey players in his 
<br>
room,  tried out for teams at school. Once he even lied to his father and 
<br>
said he'd gotten onto his school's football team. The father punished him 
<br>
for not being a regular kid by constantly criticizing everything he did. It 
<br>
would be difficult to think of any more sadistic treatment, especially 
<br>
since the kid's mother died when he was 10 and his father was all he had. 
<br>
These days they keep the kid pretty zonked out on various psychoactive 
<br>
drugs--I understand a huge portion of school kids these days are taking 
<br>
psychoactive drugs. One might argue that it's a good thing you can use 
<br>
drugs to overcome difficulties adjusting. Unfortunately, the drugs have 
<br>
some unhealthy effects when used long-term. The drugs, too, are a form of 
<br>
discipline.
<br>
<p>Seems sadistic to me, and yet the father would insist he loves his kid. He 
<br>
spends lavish amounts of money on the kid, sends him to the best private 
<br>
school in town, the best summer camp in Texas. He probably believes the kid 
<br>
would be happier as a regular guy, believes that he's doing the kid a favor 
<br>
by steering him in that direction. Where I think he's mistaken is in not 
<br>
respecting his kid as an intelligent, whole human.  This may seem like an 
<br>
extreme example, since the kid actually tried to kill himself; but I see 
<br>
this sort of emotional coercion being used against kids by their parents 
<br>
ALL the time. One of my daughters friends wants more than anything to major 
<br>
in music and be a high school music teacher. Her parents tell her 
<br>
scornfully that it's a stupid idea--music teachers don't make enough money.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;Are you surprised to learn that we do it because we love our children 
</em><br>
dearly and want to make their lives easier?
<br>
<p>No, not surprised at all. I just think you're mistaken in believing that 
<br>
you can use force to help someone learn. Force results in a change of 
<br>
behavior, but it doesn't show the child how to learn and to think for herself.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>  &gt;&gt;Do you really believe that you need to come up against hard realities?
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;&gt;What sort of hard realities do you need to come up against?
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt;Sure.  My income isn't infinite, so my wife and I have to discipline 
</em><br>
ourselves to spend wisely.  I've had to learn lots about my taxes and 
<br>
the &gt;business world, not because I enjoy it, but because they're skills 
<br>
I've needed to achieve my goals in life.  I have customers to keep 
<br>
pleased &gt;when honestly, I'd prefer to be with my family, exercising, 
<br>
reading, or playing video games.  As time goes on, I'll come up against 
<br>
other &gt;hard realities, as I and my loved ones are victims of crime, 
<br>
disease, or our own stupidities.  These limitations of life are what I term 
<br>
&quot;hard &gt;realities&quot;.
<br>
<p>And how would this relate to disciplining a child? Are you saying you'll 
<br>
arrange situations in which the child is thwarted so she'll know how to 
<br>
achieve goals?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Yes, when our daughter cried upon being put to bed at certain times, we 
</em><br>
let her cry for a bit before going to bed.  Training her to go to bed &gt;at a 
<br>
certain time early on means that she's now very reliable about knowing her 
<br>
limits concerning bedtime.
<br>
<p>There's no doubt you can train a child into certain patterns of behavior. 
<br>
Surely you did the bedtime training for your own convenience though, rather 
<br>
than for the child's benefit?
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;When mommy and daddy say it's time for bed, she goes to bed without many 
</em><br>
problems.
<br>
<p>Yes, of course.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;We could have done like my close friend's wife.  She couldn't stand to 
</em><br>
hear their baby crying, so even though the child is 3 1/2, the 
<br>
mother &gt;*still* has to rock the child to sleep and cater to the child's 
<br>
whims about where he wants to sleep and when.
<br>
<p>Somehow I don't see anything so horrible about *still* rocking a little 3 
<br>
1/2 year old child to sleep. One person's whims may be another person's 
<br>
important issues. I don't want to put words into your post, but it appears 
<br>
to me as though you have the attitude that simply because you're older and 
<br>
bigger, your way is the right way, and the younger, smaller person's 
<br>
preferences don't count for anything.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The kid has an absolute panic attack if she isn't there when he wakes up 
</em><br>
from a nap.  You were mentioning &quot;independence&quot;?
<br>
<p>I hardly think 3 1/2 years is an age at which we should expect human 
<br>
children to be out on their own. Do you really think a person should be 
<br>
independent at such an early age? In the usual course of childhood, 
<br>
independence is gained gradually, a step at a time, and full independence 
<br>
doesn't come until 14 or 15 (in our culture, of course, we typically 
<br>
prolong the period of dependence until 18 - 22)
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt;&gt;I think rather than more discipline, what's needed is for people to 
</em><br>
understand the learning and thinking process and to acknowledge 
<br>
that &gt;&gt;learning and thinking cannot be forced.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;When I was an employee at a company, and my boss said, &quot;We need to 
</em><br>
implement this totally different X with this new technology Y.&quot;  &gt;You bet 
<br>
your sweet bippy that I did some forced learning and thinking. That's the 
<br>
way life normally works, and to shield children from being &gt;trained in 
<br>
methods of coping with that is a tremendous disservice to them.
<br>
<p>Good training for followers of orders, to be sure. But how about for 
<br>
creative, independent thinkers?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt;Here's an excerpt from an article by Katherine A. Dettwyler, PhD. 
</em><br>
Abstract with references at &gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/BA/Aug94p3.html">http://www.lalecheleague.org/BA/Aug94p3.html</a>
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Thanks for the link, I'll take a look at it, although the excerpt you 
</em><br>
posted really was just a vague theory, and not scientific evidence. 
<br>
I'm &gt;ooking for more of the latter type of information.
<br>
<p>Abstracts are summaries of the research, not a complete description of the 
<br>
research. You have to read the complete paper to get the details. To the 
<br>
best of my knowledge, forced weaning is something that's usually done 
<br>
because of social pressure or because the mother has to do work that 
<br>
involves leaving the child in someone else's care or because the mother 
<br>
gets pregnant again before the child has weaned. I don't believe I've ever 
<br>
seen evidence that's it's healthier for the child.
