<em>&gt;What about cloning for body part replacements?  
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a perfectly good use of cloning tech, as long as we
<br>
are talking about individual parts or organs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Is all you are simply a &quot;phenotype&quot;?  
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you believe that you have the right to keep others from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extending their lives by any and all means that do not violate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights of others?  
</em><br>
<p>No, But a clone is an individual, and therefore has rights
<br>
independant of the &quot;wishs&quot; of the person who created it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Is it your business to decide whether or not this or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that individual or all such individuals 'deserve' to live longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or to create more copies of themselves by means of sex (partial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;copies) or cloning (total genetic copies)?  No?  Then I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand the above statement.  'Merit it' according to whom?  
</em><br>
<p>As previously stated I have no problem with the use of cloning
<br>
technology to create new body parts or organs.
<br>
<p>However cloning a whole individual is not merely making a copy of
<br>
oneself but the creation of an entirely new individual who merely
<br>
has most of the genetic material of the original. A clone of an
<br>
individual is a seperate individual, not merely a copy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Continued life is its own merit.  
</em><br>
<p>I could not possibly agree more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, if you mean simply making copies of myself, I would say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too could have merit if those copies can support themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;productively. 
</em><br>
<p>As I stated, a clone of an individual is a new individual, not
<br>
merely a copy of the original. All individuals have independant
<br>
rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Who would decide who should be cloned or not?  Why not simply let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the market decide?  
</em><br>
<p>There is a great deal more to life and society than the market.
<br>
This is not simply an economic question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Deliberate cloning is low breed stuff, or to put it in an easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; spreadable meme:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;cloning is for livestock.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You are welcome to your opinion, of course, just as long as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't wish to see it enforced as more than that.
</em><br>
<p>I will continue to support the rights of individuals, and their
<br>
opinions.
