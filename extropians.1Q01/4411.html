<em>&gt; ...So then, well and good, I'm glad to hear it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But where did this phrase:

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;largely UNpopular with other scientists, who tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                          ^^^^^^^^^^

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from?  Do these words come from _your_ experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with scientists?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;secret knowledge&quot; ??!!    (== &quot;science concepts&quot; ??)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;unwashed masses&quot; ??!!     (== &quot;nonscientists&quot; ??)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find these phrases antagonistic and a complete disconnect with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my knowledge and experience. I've been in the sciences 20 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I've yet to encounter another scientist who treats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonscientists with this kind of scorn, as you describe above.
</em><br>
<p>**Well, that could be because they're treating YOU as a colleague. 
<br>
Were you in the company of nonscientists who were complete strangers 
<br>
with no knowlege of the disciplines? Or maybe you just hang out with 
<br>
nice guys.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;:)
<br>
<p>**Actually,  the 'secret knowledge' thing is Gould's. The 'unwashed 
<br>
masses' is mine. The same principle is at work with cops and 
<br>
religious leaders: Knowledge is power, and power shared is power lost.
<br>
&nbsp;This is why cops fight open public access to public records, and why the Church 
<br>
conducted masses in  Latin and hated Gutenberg.
<br>
<p>**I've not met many scientists I truly disliked, though I've read 
<br>
(and read of) a good number of insufferable ones with the decidedly 
<br>
unscientific attitude that &quot;If the facts don't fit the theory, they 
<br>
must be disposed of.&quot; Before you say it ain't so, consider plate 
<br>
tectonics as but a single well-documented example. More recently, 
<br>
you've got people with pet theories threatening to deny telescope 
<br>
time to people with conflicting theories--whose time on those devices 
<br>
could disprove the pet theories. Same-old, same-old; was it Clarke or 
<br>
Asimov who said things change when the old guys die? You've got guys 
<br>
out there right now calling nanotech science fiction and acting as 
<br>
though it's never going to happen. 
<br>
<p>**With the possible exception of religious fundamentalists, there is 
<br>
no other community as blindly intolerant of new ideas as the 
<br>
scientific community. None. Nada. Zippo. Zilch.
<br>
<p>**&quot;All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. 
<br>
Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-
<br>
evident.&quot; -- Arthur Schopenhauer 
<br>
<p><p>**I HAVE, however, met a number of reporters I couldn't stand. The AQ 
<br>
(arrogance quotient) of some compares with that of some scientists--
<br>
which is to say, it's off the scale.
