<em>&gt; Hans Moravec calls our intelligent robotic descendents &quot;mind children&quot;,

</em><br>
<p>Moravec paints some pretty scary pictures himself in the sequel
<br>
to _Mind Children_ (_Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Being_).
<br>
He suggests that unenhanced humans, in order to protect themselves,
<br>
may require transhumans who wish to expand their capacities beyond
<br>
a certain limit to, in effect, resign from the human race, accept
<br>
a severance package, and head out into space.  He suggests that the
<br>
first of these &quot;Ex&quot;es (as in ex-humans) will rule the roost, picking
<br>
off newcomers as they leave the earth, and perhaps eventually
<br>
holding Earth hostage.  I believe Moravec actually uses the
<br>
image of a drop of pond water as a metaphor for the sort of
<br>
Darwinian free-for-all he envisions among the Exes in the
<br>
Solar System (those with less of a taste for battle
<br>
and lucky enough to get through this gauntlet will head straight
<br>
for deep space).

</em><br>
<p>As for Macleod -- no, I haven't read anything besides _Cassini_,
<br>
though I have heard rumors that the larger picture he paints is a more
<br>
subtle one than might be supposed from that book alone (I should hope so!).
<br>
I take it then, that MacLeod's portrayal of the &quot;Outwarders&quot; is
<br>
not necessarily the author's own view of the matter.

<em>&gt; Thank you, Dale!  You phrased that perfectly - better than I did, in fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've changed positions quite a bit over the years...
</em><br>
<p>Well, it was a paraphrase from memory, not a direct quote.  I don't
<br>
think it was a careless misrepresentation -- I've been reading
<br>
Yudkowsky's Web articles since 1997 with some attention, and I
<br>
could have sworn I've read things on this list (and in the
<br>
Meaning of Life FAQ) to the effect that the rational goal of
<br>
thinking folks at this stage of history should be to abet the
<br>
creation of an SI, that what happens to the human race after that
<br>
will be pretty much up to the SI, and that if there seems to be
<br>
a conflict of interest between humanity and the SI then, again,
<br>
rational folks will support the SI because it will know best.
<br>
<p>It all sounds a bit like that 1969 movie &quot;Colossus: The Forbin Project&quot;,
<br>
which is a very grown-up treatment of the subject (much more so than
<br>
&quot;The Matrix&quot;).  However, it was not my intention to attack this
<br>
position, merely to exhibit it (from memory) as the sort of thing
<br>
that can give ordinary folks the shivers.  I mentioned Yudkowsky specifically
<br>
only because he has laced his (high-profile, as such things go) Web
<br>
essays with such verve and personality.
<br>
<p>Apologies to Eliezer if I have overlooked his most recent positions on
<br>
these matters -- I certainly didn't mean to suggest that **he** is a monster!
<br>
Also, perhaps the juxtaposition with de Garis and Warwick was a bit
<br>
misleading.  However, it's been my impression that being willing even to contemplate
<br>
the end of humanity (whether by death or the metamorphosis of
<br>
&quot;human-ness&quot; into something else) -- to take a cosmic, Stapledonian view of the
<br>
place of Man in the cosmos -- gets one pegged as somewhat cold-
<br>
blooded by a lot of people with more conventional horizons.
<br>
<p>I got a face full of this back in 6th grade (in 1963 or 64), when
<br>
I dared to mention Arthur C. Clarke's _Profiles of the Future_ (and
<br>
in particular, some of the stuff in a chapter entitled &quot;The Obsolescence
<br>
of Man&quot;) in a class discussion.  The hapless teacher, Mrs. W., reacted
<br>
with a mixture of scorn, anger, and (I think) fear that my
<br>
tender mind had been polluted by such rubbish.  She didn't send
<br>
me to the principal's office, but she was at pains to point out to
<br>
the rest of the class that such notions as cybernetic organisms
<br>
and personal immortality were sheer hogwash:  &quot;Strike that from
<br>
the record!&quot;, she said, in effect.  In retrospect, that doesn't
<br>
surprise me, but it's a little disappointing that I was apparently
<br>
the only one in class who was reading that stuff.  Come to think of
<br>
it, that was around the same time that I first saw what remains
<br>
my all-time favorite portrayal of a transhuman -- David McCallum's
<br>
role as Gwyllm Griffiths in the original _Outer Limits_ episode 
<br>
&quot;The Sixth Finger&quot;.
<br>
<p>I guess the point I was trying to make is that it may not
<br>
ever be possible, or even desirable, to candy-coat this stuff
<br>
for the masses.  Most people still get the screaming meemies
<br>
at the sort of universe that modern science rubs Man's face
<br>
in -- particularly the Darwinian vision of life.  Any film buffs
<br>
remember Katherine Hepburn as Violet Venable in the movie
<br>
of Tennessee Williams' _Suddenly Last Summer_ describing her
<br>
poet son Sebastian's reaction to seeing the birds swoop down
<br>
on the newly-hatched sea turtles during a visit to the
<br>
Encantadas?  That's what I mean.
<br>
<p>Finally, abject apologies for the inconvenient line breaks in my last couple
<br>
of posts -- they were originating in my own Netscape outgoing message
<br>
settings, which I have adjusted.
