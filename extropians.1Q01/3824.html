<p>
Apologies if you've seen this before...
<br>
<p>1. More than 98 percent of convicted felons are bread users.
<br>
2. Fully 50% of all children who grow up in bread-consuming households score
<br>
below average on standardized tests.
<br>
3. In the 18th century, when virtually all bread was baked in the home, the
<br>
average life expectancy was less than 50 years; infant mortality rates were
<br>
unacceptably high; many women died in childbirth; and diseases such as
<br>
typhoid, yellow fever, and influenza ravaged whole nations.
<br>
4. Every piece of bread you eat brings you nearer to death.
<br>
5. Bread is associated with all the major diseases of the body. For example,
<br>
nearly all sick people have eaten bread. The effects are obviously
<br>
cumulative: a. 99.9% of all people who die from cancer have eaten bread. b.
<br>
100% of all soldiers have eaten bread. c. 96.9% of all Communist
<br>
sympathizers have eaten bread. d. 99.7% of the people involved in air and
<br>
auto accidents ate bread within 6 months preceding the accident. e. 93.1% of
<br>
juvenile delinquents came from homes where bread is served frequently.
<br>
6. Evidence points to the long-term effects of bread eating: Of all the
<br>
people born in 1839 who later dined on bread, there has been a 100%
<br>
mortality rate.
<br>
7. Bread is made from a substance called &quot;dough.&quot; It has been proven that as
<br>
little as one pound of dough can be used to suffocate a mouse. The average
<br>
American eats more bread than that in one month!
<br>
8. Primitive tribal societies that have no bread exhibit a low incidence of
<br>
cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and osteoporosis.
<br>
9. Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects deprived of bread and
<br>
given only water to eat begged for bread after as little as two days.
<br>
10. Bread is often a &quot;gateway&quot; food item, leading the user to &quot;harder&quot; items
<br>
such as butter, jelly, peanut butter, and even cold cuts.
<br>
11. Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since the human body is more than
<br>
90 percent water, it follows that eating bread could lead to your body being
<br>
taken over by this absorptive food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey
<br>
bread-pudding person.
<br>
12. Newborn babies can choke on bread.
<br>
13. Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 400 degrees Fahrenheit! That
<br>
kind of heat can kill an adult in less than one minute. Increased
<br>
temperatures cause global warming.
<br>
14. Most bread eaters are utterly unable to distinguish between serious
<br>
significant scientific fact and meaningless statistical political babbling.
<br>
15. Jesus ate bread at his last meal.
