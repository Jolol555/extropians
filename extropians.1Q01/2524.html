<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; Overall, I think the preprogrammed nature of the school

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; as it is here) is a problem in itself. The basic premise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; of education is that adults determine what kids should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; learn, and then these facts are rammed down children's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; throats. And kids who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Huh?  If that is what education is then it would be a pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  wrong-headed enterprise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps I was wrong to assume that US has it the same as we do over here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Speaking for our country, the system is such that from age 7 to 19, you sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a classroom with 30 other kids 6-8 hours a day and endure the Chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt;torture that is listening or pretending to listen to the teacher. This can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be fun and exciting if the teacher is good and can motivate you, but too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many teachers (most of them) aren't good enough to be able to do that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hence, if your luck with teachers is bad enough, 13 years of boredom.
</em><br>
<p>Notice that you started out blaming the system and forced curriculum, 
<br>
but then admitted that the problem is more directly associated with 
<br>
poor teachers.  Not that I'm completely against more flexibility in 
<br>
determining your own curriculum, but how would it solve the problem 
<br>
of having poor teachers?
<br>
<p>Shouldn't the first priority be to improve the quality of our teachers?
<br>
<p>Regards,
