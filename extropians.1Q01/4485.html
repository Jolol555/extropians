<p>
A thought has been nagging for awhile. I don't recall seeing a discussion of
<br>
it, so I'll put it out for critiquing.
<br>
<p>For context, I'll summarize the three paths through the Spike / Singularity
<br>
I've seen discussed:
<br>
1. Build the Seed. Be honest and act &quot;decently&quot; toward it, and hope it
<br>
develops into a friendly and sympathetic AI, then SI. Trust it to manage
<br>
things.
<br>
2. Work for IA or uploading. Try to be very careful that the individuals,
<br>
particularly the first ones, are sane and benevolent, and have so stable a
<br>
character that the increase in knowledge and power won't cause a breakdown
<br>
or a corruption. Trust them to manage things and expand their number
<br>
rapidly.
<br>
3. Work for MNT. Keep it as democratic and open as possible. Work zealously
<br>
against abuse and develop defensive technology. The hope is that an
<br>
outpouring of wealth, distributed widely and quickly, and the knowledge that
<br>
things to follow, like super-longevity, will radically improve the human
<br>
condition, may produce a super-critical state where &quot;meme-locks&quot; (e.g.,
<br>
Israeli vs. Palestinian, Serb vs. Albanian, Believer vs. Infidel, Us vs.
<br>
Them) become fluid, hatreds are set aside, and a healthy community is
<br>
achieved.
<br>
<p>What follows isn't really a fourth path, because it's not exclusive of the
<br>
others. It could be considered an aspect of IA.
<br>
<p>Start with the observation that empathy and terrorism or aggression tend to
<br>
be mutually exclusive. Empathy is a kind of identity based upon
<br>
imagination-using what we know about ourselves to project into the shoes of
<br>
another. Unlike identity, it is an intentional act. Psychopathology aside,
<br>
we cannot choose not to have identity-we are flooded with internal
<br>
information. But we often choose to withhold empathy. The injustice and
<br>
violence in the world is ample evidence of that.
<br>
<p>I think that one of the surest ways to make safe traversal of the
<br>
Singularity more likely would be to give emphasis within IA to developing
<br>
broad-band neural interfacing and developing neural structures to support
<br>
multi-level identity. We don't need and, speaking for myself, don't want to
<br>
replace self-identity with some borgist group identity. But multi-level
<br>
identity would facilitate both strong individualism and strong communal
<br>
spirit. It would counter most of the dangers of the traversal.
<br>
