<em>&gt; Maximum practical number of &quot;arms&quot; on a free-roaming assembler...
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you could clarify what you mean by free-roaming.  Roaming in what?
<br>
An assembler that roams in water might be different than one which roams
<br>
in air, and one that roams in vacuum would be more different yet.
<br>
<p>As far as the number of arms, I suppose you could have larger or smaller
<br>
assemblers with different number of arms.  At a minimum you'd probably
<br>
need two arms.  But of course you could have a much larger assembler
<br>
with more arms.  I don't see why there would be any particular limit to
<br>
the number of arms you could have on a large assembler.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Approximate diameter (or largest cross-sectional measurement) of such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assembler, including &quot;arms...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I can't find my copy of Nanosystems, but Nanomedicine describes a minimal
<br>
two-armed assembler with an external power supply and control unit that
<br>
would be about 200 nm long by about 50 nm wide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Approximate maximum replication rate for each individual assembler of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type specified above, i.e.--how many copies of itself it can construct per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second, assuming an environment rich in raw materials...
</em><br>
<p>Freitas estimates that the assembler can work at the rate of 1 million
<br>
atoms per second (not to imply it necessarily places one atom at a time).
<br>
The simple assembler above has about 16 million atoms so would take 16
<br>
seconds to replicate.  A more complete assembler with nanocomputer and
<br>
instructional tape would take more like 100 seconds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; References to earlier speculations by others on these matters are also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welcome. I'm aware of some, but surely not all. I would guess the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical shape for a free-roaming assembler would be spheroid.
</em><br>
<p>Again, it depends a great deal on what it is going to do.  If it is
<br>
supposed to engage in locomotion then we need to have room for propulsion
<br>
units, etc.  Similarly, what are the raw materials for the replication?
<br>
If it is given a &quot;molecular soup&quot; of tagged reactants designed to be used
<br>
by the replicator then its job is relatively easy.  If it is sitting in
<br>
the ocean then things are harder.  If it is supposed to build copies
<br>
of itself out of bare rock then it probably needs a lot of components
<br>
dedicated to dissolving the rock and making it useful.
<br>
<p>It may also be that the arms are not pointing outward, but rather inward
<br>
so that the work area is clean (i.e. hard vacuum).  In that case some
<br>
other shape might be best.
<br>
<p>As another data point you might look at Freitas' respirocyte design,
<br>
<a href="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html">http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html</a>.  This does
<br>
not replicate, it just stores and releases oxygen and CO2, but it is
<br>
a one micron, spherical machine built from about 27 billion atoms.
<br>
If you had an assembler+extras of similar size with only the two arms
<br>
inside it could self-replicate in 27000 seconds or 8 hours.  I suspect
<br>
you could put many more arms in something of this size though and get
<br>
replication time down to several minutes.
<br>
