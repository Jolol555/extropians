</em><br>
<em>&gt; we see a desire to impose structure on urban life at every level from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; city's inception.  It is possible to imagine a less pre-determined and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organic implementation, in which the basic structure of an arcology is laid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to provide a mechanical and infrastructure grid and then fine-scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development is allowed to happen on an emergent basis (but, ironically, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would require even more prior engineering work than a more fully planned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arcology).  However, in either case, the basic notion of an arcology calls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a level of up-front planning that seems inconsistent with the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open-ended evolutionary flexibility that I've come to see as the most healthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental value for urban life.
</em><br>
<p>All fully planned and successful communities currently in existence are
<br>
small, relative to cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Tokyo.  Large
<br>
cities can have semi-managed growth, but that's apparently the limits
<br>
of human capability.  One of the more infamous recent experiments in
<br>
massively wide scale planning, the Soviet Union, failed in part because
<br>
of its inefficiencies.
<br>
<p>This is also a problem for building space station habitats intended for
<br>
similar numbers of people.  For that reason, this problem (how to
<br>
build an infrastructure that 100,000+ people can move into, both at
<br>
their own pace and after the infrastructure reaches its initial limits,
<br>
given the inability to precisely plan for that many as opposed to the
<br>
single digit crews of current space stations and space vehicles) may
<br>
well merit investigation.
<br>
<p>One possible solution: keep one side of the structure relatively clear
<br>
of habitation.  When the rest of the structure has enough population
<br>
density that it becomes tempting to use the clear side, build some more
<br>
structure on that side.  The outside edge of the new construction
<br>
becomes the new &quot;clear zone&quot;; the old one, and any non-reserved area in
<br>
the new construction, gets opened up for habitation.  Problem: this can
<br>
be extended indefinitely for space habitats, but gravity makes this
<br>
suitable only for horizontal expansion planetside...and without the
<br>
vertical use and planned transit connections that arcologies promise,
<br>
what does this accomplish besides building a city like any other?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Beyond this, the problem of capital concentration seems to make Soleri's most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambitious ideas impractical in any but a world completely freed from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics of scarcity by full-blown Drexlerian nanotech.  Working as I do now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the world of very large scale engineering and construction, I fear the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of social structure required to support the concentration of capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to undertake a &quot;real&quot; arcology as envisioned by Soleri.  A few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred million dollars seems to be a practical upper limit on the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money that can be sunk into development of any engineering project by private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests.  With current and near-term technology, this seems to be far short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what would be required to finance the building of the infrastructural and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil/structural &quot;core&quot; of a working arcology of any meaningful size (even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;village&quot; of a hundred thousand or so, much less a real city . . .)
</em><br>
<p>There's a few ways around it, but they're not easy.  For instance, one
<br>
could try to decelerate one of the near-earth asteroids such that it
<br>
stayed in Earth's orbit, a bit ahead or behind Earth itself, then
<br>
launch robo-miners to break the asteroid down and return it, piece by
<br>
piece, to Earth for sale (at least, those pieces which could not be
<br>
more cheaply obtained on Earth - precious metals to start, then other
<br>
pieces as the organization figured out how to return mass more
<br>
cheaply), and get the necessary capital concentration that way.  But
<br>
that's just a *little* involved...
