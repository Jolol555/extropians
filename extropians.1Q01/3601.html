<p><p>You could frame this in the same way as any risky behavior:  It is 
<br>
reasonable to expect in any activity that one has tacitly accepted the 
<br>
obvious risks involved.  There is a reasonable expectation of possibly 
<br>
getting killed in a bank robbery, and by engaging in that activity, one has 
<br>
tacitly accepted the possibility of that outcome.  Just because you don't 
<br>
like it doesn't mean that one can blithely ignore the risks without 
<br>
accepting the possibility.  When a skydiver jumps out of a plane they have 
<br>
tacitly accepted the possibility that they might die due to a parachute 
<br>
failure.  Whether or not the chute rigger may share responsibility for the 
<br>
outcome, it in no way absolves the jumper of the consequences of his action.
<br>
<p>If a bank robber had the ability to dictate outcomes, he certainly wouldn't 
<br>
need to rob a bank for cash.
