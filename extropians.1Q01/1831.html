<p><em> &gt; Legislating a total ban without compensation on something that most

<p>Firstly, I concede that what I teased you with is probably unworkable in a
<br>
society like the USA. But it's not stupid; it's just unworkable.
<br>
<p>Beyond that, your argument is a bit funny in its own right. You say that
<br>
&quot;everyone has firearms&quot;. So if there was a buyback, the government should
<br>
pay for these firearms. But who pays the government to do it? The people do,
<br>
obviously. The same people who have guns would pay themselves the price to
<br>
let go of the guns. :-) On a larger scale, this scheme is economically
<br>
equivalent to just taking the guns away at no compensation.
<br>
<p>You see, the problem your society seems to have is that you are in love with
<br>
firearms, 100 years after there shouldn't be any rational use for them
<br>
anymore. At the time your founding fathers set up the constitution, America
<br>
was a cowboy land. Sure, you definitely needed a shotgun at that time, as
<br>
many of them as possible. But that time has passed, has it? You now have
<br>
gun-wielding cowboys passing through New York and San Francisco, and I think
<br>
that's just a little bit misplaced.
<br>
<p>One day when you get around to it you might want to rethink that part of
<br>
your constitution. [As well as the electoral college part, I might add.]
<br>
<p>No offense intended - it's just that a society's rules need to develop along
<br>
with the society. Although a conservative pace of development is usually
<br>
beneficial as far as the law is concerned, you seem to be stuck in a hole
<br>
with no way out: Johnny grow up with guns, Johnny emotionally attached to
<br>
guns.
<br>
<p>Of course, I may be wrong. Maybe guns are good. But I sure don't want to
<br>
live in a neighbourhood where every lunatic has one; I prefer a
<br>
neighbourhood where the most they can do is punch you in the face.
