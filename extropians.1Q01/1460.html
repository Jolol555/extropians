<p>Whatever for?  I can think of a lot better things to do than spend my

infinite lifespan ordering around lesser beings!  What a drag that would

be. With infinite avenues of knowledge and an entire galaxy to explore
<br>
and more beyond that, exactly why would I bother with a drunken, jaded,
<br>
Roman emperor's view of the perfect life?   I am sure that there would
<br>
be just as many who would be determined to liberate any such slaves as
<br>
those interesting in being slave holders.

<p>I think if we got to the point where an individual could actually choose
<br>
to become a hermit in an asteroid and pull it off that there would be so
<br>
very many possibilities in the society that any stagnation around such
<br>
dystopian dreams as the above is considerably unlikely.  Too many beings
<br>
would simply have a lot better things to do.
