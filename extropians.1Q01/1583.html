<p>I don't think that people are quite understanding what you mean by 
<br>
QOS - because it's a huge problem that needs to be solved on data 
<br>
networks before they could be used to carry voice traffic.
<br>
<p>On the data networks, IP is the protocol that's used for data 
<br>
transmission.  IP is a great protocol in many ways, but it simply 
<br>
wasn't designed to provide highly reliable dedicated connections.
<br>
<p>It's one thing for your connection to flake out while you're browsing 
<br>
your friend's home pages.  You just wait for the retries to 
<br>
eventually get past the problem, you hit reload, or you just try 
<br>
again later.  Due to the dogged nature of retries going on in the 
<br>
background, you often don't even notice the discontinuities in your 
<br>
Internet connections.
<br>
<p>However, if you're talking to your friend and the signal keeps 
<br>
cutting out and you keep having to call him up, you'd become quite 
<br>
unhappy.  If you're trying to call 911 but you can't get through 
<br>
because everyone is using all of the available bandwidth in your 
<br>
neighborhood to get to CNN's Elian Gonzales web page, you're in big 
<br>
trouble.
<br>
<p>Although consumers have become used to intermittent service 
<br>
difficulties on cell phone networks and on the Internet, they just 
<br>
won't tolerate the same kinds of problems on dedicated land lines.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
