</em><br>
<p>I made a similar terminology complaint in the earlier thread at
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/3014.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/3014.html</a>.

<p><em>&gt; The issue of what countermeasures would work after notice of the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is definitely worth further exploration. Why don't you work up something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for publication?
</em><br>
<p>In the earlier discussion at
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/3019.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/3019.html</a>, Robert
<br>
Bradbury (who was involved in the Foresight discussions leading to the
<br>
creation of the paper) discussed particle beam weapons as a possible
<br>
countermeasure.  You would have earth-orbiting satellites watching for
<br>
&quot;hot spots&quot; which indicate a point of infection, and which sterilize
<br>
the vicinity with neutron bombardment or some other form of disruptive
<br>
radiation.
<br>
<p>Again I suggest reviewing the dozen-odd messages from last spring.
<br>
That will provide a good starting point for further analysis.
