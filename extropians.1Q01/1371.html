<p><em>&gt; Question/problem: if physical immortality arrives, with attendant

</em><br>
<em>&gt; into conservative, nostalgic sheeple who use their collected wisdom and
</em><br>

<p>Geriatrically gifted people are usually more adept in politics, why,
<br>
they had more practice, and old boy networks take time to mature/cumulate.
<br>
But their grip on the young people is by no means total. If innovation
<br>
indeed gives competitive edge (a rather safe bet), those societies with 
<br>
the broadest productive layer will outperform more stratified ones. Whether
<br>
import (brain drain), aiding birth rate or dirty Tleilaxu (primates and
<br>
engineered people used for breeding, assuming there's a cure for hospitalism), 
<br>
there are solutions for restocking the idea furnace.
<br>
<p>Also, it might be possible to throw a few genetic switches (drugs, 
<br>
tissue transplants, etc.), and rejuvenate the brain. Senility doesn't 
<br>
have to be only second childhood, does it?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Answer/solution: it only takes one person committed to renewing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own physical and mental advancement, and to offering such advances to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of humanity, to keep the flame alive.  It is easier if there are
</em><br>
<p>A small group would do. Space will become a frontier, while Earth
<br>
might stagnate (I do not yet subscribe to this alternative reality
<br>
branch, though. The Far East looks like plenty of frontier right
<br>
now).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; many, for individuals can be drowned out by the tides of the masses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though if this went to its logical extreme the individuals could take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hermitage, probably asteroid habitats given the tech level society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would likely settle at in this case.  This might result in raiding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aging society for its younger members, not yet calcified in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking, though one suspects that the long term revolution this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help forment would be ignored if the short term production of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extracted people was replaced by the extractor, say by more robots or by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements to existing ones.
</em><br>
<p>Space is a substrate which extremely rewards (and punishes, of course)
<br>
innovation. Somebody, somewhere is eventually going to hit the jackpot,
<br>
and then what happens down here will quite soon become irrelevant but
<br>
for chronic nostalgics.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I should write that one up.  Make for one heck of a dystopia (in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Welcome to the slave pit. With time, you'll like it here.
