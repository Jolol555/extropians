<p>Huh?  You mean like life extension, immortality, dinking with our

genetics, intelligent computers, uploading and the rest of the stuff I

have been reading about and drooling over for 4 decades?  :-)

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; An excerpt:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But why was the renascence of a red-blooded, fundamentalist capitalism not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseen? Why, indeed, did Huxley in Brave New World (1932), Orwell in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and Clarke and Kubrick in A Space Odyssey (1968)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have so little to say about economics, given its centrality to human life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why, in effect, did they assume that technology or planning would take care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of economic issues?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Heinlein, for one, had plenty of respect for capitalism and liberty that
<br>
was evident in many of his books &quot;way back when&quot;.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answer, I think, is that none of them imagined that the clock could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned back. Converts to the market often imagine they are embracing a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy. In reality, they are old fogies who are uncritically recycling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas first popular in the 17th and 18th centuries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What a silly &quot;analysis&quot;.  That there are recurring human and social
<br>
themes is woven in with sci-fi quite thoroughly, generally speaking. 
<br>
That something was dealt with or dreamed up or understood 2 or 3 hundred
<br>
years ago is hardly a reason its implications would not come up in
<br>
sci-fi.  Uncritical hell.  It takes a fair amount of work and
<br>
intellectual rigor to come up with why capitalism has a solit place now
<br>
and in the future.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That was the era when the leading philosophers, influenced by Newton's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanistic physics, created the myth of the atomistic individual that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergirds the market ideology. The intellectual history of the 19th and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early 20th centuries is largely one of a heroic struggle to demonstrate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flaws in that superficially appealing story.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>OK.  This &quot;analysis&quot; is too out to lunch and obviously highly slanted to
<br>
waste further time on.
