<p>I was not aware that MS was passing out drugs with their products.  :-) 
<br>
<p>MS is NOT the mainstream except on the desktop.  They are not even the
<br>
majority player in the server world and definitely not in the embedded
<br>
world.
<br>
Since most corporations have (unfortunately) become fixated on the Web
<br>
client as the UI, almost all of the real action in software today in
<br>
corporate IT and associated products is server side.  
<br>
<p>Since when did MS put a lot of effort into development?  OSes with
<br>
65,000+ open bugs?  OSes that still wouldn't know multi-user
<br>
functionality if it bit them in the ass?  MS has hired up a lot of good
<br>
talent and mostly buried it.  I mean these are the people who give you a
<br>
&quot;power development tool&quot; where the IDE, the program you are debugging,
<br>
and the debugger itself are all in the same thread!  Yep, that shows a
<br>
lot of thought and a that a lot of the billions bilked from their
<br>
customer base is being put into development.  Yep.  
<br>
<p>SQL Server is inferior to Oracle, to Sybase (which it was extracted
<br>
from) and is even inferior in many useability aspects to MS Access.  It
<br>
is inferior to the Open Source database, Postgresql.
<br>
<p>Yes, you can make a lot of money learning whatever set of tools some
<br>
organization decides to demand this year whether it makes any sense or
<br>
not. But you will learn more and be more valuable in the long run if you
<br>
are pickier and put your time in learning the technologies that really
<br>
the best to the best of your ability to discern them.  You can make a
<br>
lot of money just giving everyone what they ask for though.  But will
<br>
you be happy and whole doing it?  Some people can stand to be whores if
<br>
paid well enough.  Some don't have the stomach for it.  I did my bit of
<br>
whoring.  I don't have to do that anymore.  And I won't.

<p><em>&gt; Note also; I've had a lot of jobs, and never used even similar sets of
