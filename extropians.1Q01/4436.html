I really don't care what these so called experts say.  Many of the &quot;experts&quot; 
<br>
turn out to be wrong.  As far as I know, the age of the longest living person 
<br>
continues to increase (although slowly) over time.  Was there another person 
<br>
known of who died at 121 before lady in France that made such big news a few 
<br>
years ago?   If so I'd like to know about it.  Also &quot;MAXIMUM life span&quot; is 
<br>
120???????  Maximum for when????  I think we're past that now.  :)

<br>
positive mind and common sense)  :)
