<em>&gt; &gt;I thought it was funny when the guy threw a cream pie at Bill Gates, but

<br>
For what? This implies there's something seriously fucked with your
<br>
legal system. About the worst damage that can be done by a cream
<br>
pie is the cost of a new set of clothing, plus a public apology for 
<br>
the indignity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's several interviews with that guy, Noel Godin:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~jaybab/noel.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~jaybab/noel.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People on his list to pie include Bill Graham, some prominent hollywood 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientologists, and The Pope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's also an &quot;anarchist pieing group&quot; that throws pies into the faces of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people they don't like. They actually have a page where you can vote for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to get pied (Vote Nader!):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.entartistes.ca/">http://www.entartistes.ca/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to go directly to the voting booth):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.entartistes.ca/scrutin.html">http://www.entartistes.ca/scrutin.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the record, I don't approve.
</em><br>
<p>I *do* approve.
<br>
<p>The application of the cream pie is a _symbolic_ assassination, not a real
<br>
one, and as such it can be seen as a way of defusing socially dangerous
<br>
tensions (and notifying the recipient that some people disapprove of
<br>
them most strongly) in a non-dangerous manner.
<br>
<p>Assassination is relatively rare but makes for a high-profile news
<br>
story. The wide coverage associated with these events causes people
<br>
to feel that they live in an unsafe or dangerous world, and that only
<br>
violent action will suffice to get a minority political point across.
<br>
Hence terrorism scares, repressive violations of civil rights, and the
<br>
whole nine yards of the police state.
<br>
<p>Replacing real assassinations with symbolic ones is, if you ask me,
<br>
a big improvement: the victim and the onlookers get the message, but
<br>
nobody gets hurt. If every homicidal loon on the planet put down
<br>
their guns and bombs and picked up a pie dish full of shaving cream,
<br>
the world would be a much safer, not to say stickier (and arguably
<br>
funnier), place.
