<p>Again, I was talking about &quot;thinking&quot; not IQ.  Thinking is strongly
<br>
dependent on training, environment and desire to make the effort in

addition to sufficient IQ for the subject at hand.  IQ, the part that is
<br>
partially inherited, is important but it is not the whole story.  There
<br>
are plenty of lazy unproductive people who have huge IQs.  I've known
<br>
some of the them. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have not explicitly stated what you believe to be the source of the

<p>Ability to think and actually using thinking are also not the same

think.  However, if the mind is not properly trained and does not cross
<br>
certain developmental thresholds at the right times, that mind will be
<br>
crippled as far as thinking goes to some extent. 
<br>
<p>Yes, training has some very real effects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Well, there is some actual evidence that beyond a certain point in life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the brain is not exactly very malleable to learning some foundational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;things including formal operations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm fairly certain that on other occasions you have stated that wealth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created rather than being a static store of resources to be divided among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. It would seem to follow that the more thinking people there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (who have also been trained to put their thinking into action to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth), the more wealth there would be. It would also seem to follow that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there would be a greater chance of progress if there were more people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ability to think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sure, that would follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Following this line of reasoning, it seems as though you would consider it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthwhile to invest in providing good nutrition and early training for as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many children as possible. I realize this would in no way provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification for anyone to force you to make such an investment against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your will. Given that as a constraint, however, it might be useful to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for ways of providing good nutrition and early training for children whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents cannot afford it (or who do not choose to provide it for them).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Good basic nutrition? Sure.  Do I believe it is my personal responsible
<br>
to provide this nutrition?  Well, to the degree I do I donate money to
<br>
programs for this (in real life I do this).  Personally I would happily
<br>
donate a large
<br>
chunk of what the government extorts from me to support students who
<br>
needed the funds.  I think anyone who supports anyone's education should
<br>
get a tax credit for doing so (yes I mean credit). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With respect to compensation for work you say:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in response to Charlie, who said &quot; Behind every aerospace engineer or chip
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; designer there's a small army of people working supermarket checkouts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; farms and food factories (so the engineers don't have to hunt their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food...&quot;}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha: &quot;Yes, and each and everyone one of them is paid the market value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution already.  So exactly why do they deserve a cut of someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else's contribution?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it really true, though, that every worker is paid the market value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their contribution?  In an ideal situation in which there were perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, perfect flow of goods and services from one region to another,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so forth--AND free market conditions, this might be true. In fact, none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these ideal conditions exist. I don't believe it's possible for them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in any but small, locally governed groups of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in a free market it is true.  The free market does not imply or
<br>
require perfection, simply freedom.  So if these conditions don't exist
<br>
does it in any way justify producting further departures from the ideal
<br>
to supposedly correct these unquantifiable and arguable departures? 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You said (in an earlier post),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;...This assumes a &quot;normal world&quot; of job opportunity distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across most intelligence levels of the population. What about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, by local beliefs coming rapidly, where only the top of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence pool can be gainfully employed (with a few service jobs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one side)? Eventually there may not be anything a given worker can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained to do that pays a living wage and there may be no region that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires such workers. What then?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't just describe the future. This describes right now for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. I personally know a number of people who are unable to get work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of minimum wage laws--the minimum wage has priced their services
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the market. OTOH such laws have resulted in price inflation which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it nearly impossible to live on earnings based on minimum wage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have said that it's not very useful to try to train people to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after they reach a certain age. I ask your own question with a slight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. What now?
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, if they have not reached certain development levels then it is
<br>
pretty unlikely they ever will.  You probably will need to support them
<br>
or let them running riot and fill up the prisons.  And do your damnest
<br>
not to let the same lack of development happen in successive
<br>
generations.  But it gets real sticky.  Government control of
<br>
child-rearing and education has some pretty obvious problems.  Yet
<br>
parents who are limited in their own development are likely to limit the
<br>
development of their children to some degree.  
<br>
<p>And what if through technology we can actually augment and more or less
<br>
rewire these developmental problems and low IQ and other problems that
<br>
keep many from participating more fully?  Offering this would be
<br>
benevolent.  But what if many, many people (as is pretty certain) refuse
<br>
it and worse?  You can't force them without violating their rights.  
<br>
This is not a small issue. Going forward it will get increasingly
<br>
critical.  
<br>
<p>Call me cynical but I don't think I am in this matter.  At some point I
<br>
think you will find that the only place these people who can't be helped
<br>
or refuse help for one reason or another can't really live the lives
<br>
they do want in what society will become as we near Singularity and go
<br>
beyond it *except* in a VR.  Let them live their VR experience until
<br>
they wish to move on.  
<br>
<p>I think this may be the closest to survival, the person's idea of what
<br>
they really want and supporting ver right to choose that you will be
<br>
able to get.  I know it is extreme.  But I don't see what else you will
<br>
be able to do a bit down the line other than letting people starve if
<br>
that can't find a niche.
