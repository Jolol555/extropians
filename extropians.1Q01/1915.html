<p>
I have lost the original post.  Who was looking for a project
<br>
in computer science?  In any case, shall I just post the idea
<br>
here?  Contact me offlist for questions if you wish.
<br>
<p>Prime numbers are very much a phenomenon of nature, or
<br>
rather meta-nature for the primes are the same for every
<br>
intelligent species that has discovered them, regardless
<br>
of what noxious fumes they respire or what number base
<br>
they may use.  Primes are universal.
<br>
<p>This idea is related to a function I have been toying with
<br>
since the publication of this month's Scientific American.
<br>
The Mathematical Recreations column describes the
<br>
gaps between primes, then defines the most common
<br>
interval as the &quot;jumping champion&quot;.
<br>
<p>The first several primes are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,
<br>
29, 31, 37, 41...  so the intervals in those first twelve primes
<br>
would be 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4.  In that interval, the
<br>
most common jump is 2, so the jumping champion for the
<br>
first 13 primes is 2, so J(13) = 2.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, this function as defined in the SA article is
<br>
rather dull.  You go out very far and the J(n) = 6 for a
<br>
looooong long time, until you get way out into the jillions.
<br>
But if you define the J function with two parameters, a
<br>
lower and an upper limit, interesting things happen.  For
<br>
instance if we wished to calc J(7, 13), the jumping champion
<br>
between the 7th and the thirteenth primes, then the primes
<br>
are 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, the jumps are 2, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4
<br>
and the jumping champion is a threeway tie between 2,
<br>
4 and 6.  For greater interest, let all ties go to the
<br>
largest, so J(7, 13) = 6.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, heres the trick.  Make a plot, the x axis is lower
<br>
limit, the Y axis is the upper limit minus the lower limit.  At
<br>
each X,Y coordinate is the jumping champion in that
<br>
interval J(X,Y).  So on our map, at the coordinates (7,[13-7])
<br>
is a column 6 high.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, if you write an algorithm to create a map of
<br>
all the jumping champions in all intervals, you create
<br>
a universal landscape of sorts, one that would be recognized
<br>
by mathematicians from the planet Ork as well as here.
<br>
<p>It is a fascinating primescape.  As I said before, the most
<br>
common jumping champion is 6, so let 6 be identified
<br>
as &quot;sea level&quot; on the primescape.  You form a coastline,
<br>
where the upper limit minus the lower limit = 1.  Along
<br>
this coastline are towers and mountains of various heights.
<br>
It really is a marvelous sight.  There are islands, isolated
<br>
&quot;land masses&quot; in a sea of 6.  There are lakes, which are
<br>
closed areas of 6 within areas of raised areas.  The
<br>
primescape contains lagoons, inlets, rivers, mesas,
<br>
islands, everything.  Again, that map that you create
<br>
is truly *universal* in that it is the same map as can
<br>
be created anywhere in the universe.
<br>
<p>Computer science student, you project will be to
<br>
write a piece of code that you can distribute over
<br>
email to volunteers, who will pool their computer
<br>
resources to map out the primescape by each taking
<br>
a range of X and Y to map.  Then you
<br>
will need some means of storing all the findings.
<br>
I have some ideas on how this could be done,
<br>
and I have already written the code to create the
<br>
map.  With enough volunteers, perhaps 30, you
<br>
should be able to create a map between 1 and
<br>
about 1 million, and about 200 pixels out to sea.
<br>
The extropian list alone should get ya 10 or 20
<br>
volunteers.  Then answer the following questions
<br>
about the primescape:
<br>
<p>1)  what is the largest island below X=1E6?
<br>
<p>2)  what is the island farthest from the coast?
<br>
<p>3)  what is the largest landlocked lake?
<br>
<p>4)  if volume is defined as area times altitude,
<br>
what is the landmass with the greatest volume
<br>
below X=1E6?
<br>
<p>5)  where is the steepest cliff?
<br>
<p>6)  where is the landmass with the greatest
<br>
number of different altitudes?
<br>
<p>7)  Are there any examples of an island within
<br>
a lake?  [answer = yes]  How many are there
<br>
of these below X = 1E6.
<br>
<p>All of these answers may be known to some
<br>
extraterrestrial beast, but no human knows them.
<br>
It would make a wicked cool computer science
<br>
project.  spike
