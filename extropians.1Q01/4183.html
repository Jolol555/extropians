<p>I hope Zeb corrects me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that's quite 
<br>
what he's saying.  I think that he's saying that PETA can have 
<br>
logical inconsistencies because its members don't even attempt to 
<br>
resolve them.  To assume that they'll alter their belief system in 
<br>
order to conform to logic is expecting too much.
<br>
<p>My experience with members of groups like PETA is that they have this 
<br>
mental disconnect at the point where logic might conflict with their 
<br>
dogma.  They'll use logic wherever they can to prove their points, 
<br>
but the moment that logic and dogma are irreconcilable, the dogma 
<br>
wins.
