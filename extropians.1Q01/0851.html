<p><em>&gt; The incident highlights how easy it could be for some with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bio-engineering knowledge to create a murderous virus for which there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be no cure or effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vaccine, New Scientist said.
</em><br>
<p>Well, to make a very murderous virus from scratch isn't easy - it
<br>
would take a lot of trial and error or careful planning to really come
<br>
up with something nasty. But now somebody has done the trial and error
<br>
job. I think we need not worry much about maniacs coming up with truly
<br>
new stuff, but rather applying already known bad stuff. 
<br>
<p>It should be noted that it is not obvious at all that an IL-4 smallpox
<br>
would be a huge threat to humans - it could be, it could be just as
<br>
troublesome as smallpox or it could be *less* troublesome. It all seem
<br>
to depend on some higher order properties of the immune system. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It suggests tougher vetting of research proposals; a greater effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to train students in biological subjects about potential dangers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arising from lab work; and encouraging greater openness among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biologists to discuss the misuse of genetic engineering.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with this case is that none of the proposed solutions
<br>
would really help. It was not an expected result at all, and
<br>
presumably any panel of experts that studied the research proposal
<br>
would not a priori be able to say that it could be dangerous. You can
<br>
protect yourself against expected dangers, and you can add safeguards
<br>
against unexpected dangers; none of the above solutions (except for
<br>
increasing awareness to some extent) will fix that.
