I enjoyed the extended post and links from Jim Fehlinger about 2001.
<br>
I've seen the movie countless times over the years but this gave me some
<br>
new perspectives on it.
<br>
<p>I don't agree that the cut from bone to satellite was meant to show them
<br>
as not just tools, but as weapons.  Although in the book there was mention
<br>
of orbiting weapons platforms, these really aren't depicted in the movie.
<br>
Going by what we see on the screen, we can't make that connection.
<br>
<p>The real point of the bone-to-spaceship cut isn't just that both are
<br>
tools; it is that the road from one to the other was mapped into our
<br>
minds and genes by the intervention of the monolith.  The spaceship is
<br>
as far as we can go along the technological path that we were placed on
<br>
by its intervention.  Now it is necessary to intervene again, to take
<br>
us up the next quantum step.  So the cut is a flash from one end to the
<br>
other of the path.
<br>
<p>I appreciated the commentary emphasizing Kubrick's sense of irony, which
<br>
I hadn't really thought much about.  The conversation in the lunar bus en
<br>
route to the monolith is especially forced.  I think the real explanation
<br>
is that these people are terrified inside but don't want anyone to know.
<br>
They are covering it up with their hearty conversations about ham and
<br>
chicken, then lining up for pictures like tourists.
<br>
<p>The comment that Floyd's speech had really given a boost to morale has
<br>
always bothered me.  Floyd's speech can hardly have had that effect.  His
<br>
speech was in reality quite chilling.  Here is a quote I found from an
<br>
online screenplay:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MICHAELS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Floyd, how long do you think
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be kept under wraps?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FLOYD
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(pleasantly)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid it can and it will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kept under wraps as long as it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is deemed to be necessary by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Council. And of course you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that the Council has requested
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that formal security oaths are to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be obtained in writing from every-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one who had any knowledge of this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event. There must be adequate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time for a full study to be made
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the situation before any con-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sideration can be given to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making a public announcement.
<br>
<p>Floyd is not only stonewalling, he is in effect threatening them by
<br>
requiring security oaths.  As I recall the scene, I had the impression
<br>
that the guy who asked the question was going to tagged as a trouble-
<br>
maker and he'd be in for some hard questioning later.  Floyd's pleasant
<br>
chuckle is masking an iron-hard control being enforced by the government.
<br>
His friendly face is a lie, and everyone in that room must have been
<br>
chilled and frightened by his implicit threats.  (And the undercurrent
<br>
of fear in the lunar shuttle may have been in part fear of Floyd and
<br>
those he represents.)
<br>
<p>Despite the suggestion that Kubrick is being ironic in his long, loving
<br>
shots of the space ships, I think he did mean them to be appreciated
<br>
in a positive way.  The use of the Blue Danube waltz, the ballet of
<br>
ship and space station and lunar colony, everything in slow motion and
<br>
choreographed with the music, is one of the most beautiful scenes of
<br>
its type.  I think this art is meant to be enjoyed for its own sake,
<br>
and there's no reason to think he is trying to undercut it with an
<br>
ironic message.
<br>
<p>One final comment.  I can't agree with the characterization of Hal as a
<br>
&quot;chatty, fussy genius&quot; or that he is more human than the human characters.
<br>
Hal is consistently calm and unemotional, very limited in his degree
<br>
of expressiveness.  It is true that the human astronauts are not much
<br>
different, but my take on this is that Kubrick is showing that the
<br>
astronauts have become like computers.  They, in effect, have copied Hal,
<br>
or Hal's designers have copied them.  Convergent evolution.
<br>
<p>The commentators missed what has always struck me as the saddest part of
<br>
the Hal lobotomizing scene: that Hal, while pleading for his life in the
<br>
throes of utter desperation, is unable to put real emotion into his voice.
<br>
&quot;Stop, Dave.  Please stop,&quot; he says, in the same calm, even tones that
<br>
he has used throughout.  His designers have deprived him of the one
<br>
element of humanity which might have saved him in the end, the ability
<br>
to project emotion.
<br>
<p>Hal
