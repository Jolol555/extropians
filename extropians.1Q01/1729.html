<em>&gt; 1) The bondholder needs to have private information about their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chances of success.  If speculators know as much as the bondholder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does about the chances of success, the bond price would get bid up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a value consistent with those chances, and the bondholder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't make any profits by actually pursuing success. 
</em><br>
<p>If some people buy because they can do something about reaching the
<br>
goal, their &quot;private information&quot; is that they will take action if
<br>
they get enough of the bonds.  The speculators can't buy until they
<br>
are sure that people who can do something have bought enough to make
<br>
it worth their while to proceed.  If the speculators beat the action
<br>
takers to the market, they'll be preventing the bonds they buy from
<br>
appreciating in value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) For every buyer there is a seller.  While a buyer has an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentive to help the social policy, the seller has an incentive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hurt that policy.  
</em><br>
<p>There are holders, non-holders, future holders, and past holders.
<br>
Holders care about success, the others don't.  (Unless I'm missing
<br>
something; does the appreciated value come out of taxes that haven't
<br>
been collected yet?  As long as the non-holders on average agree with
<br>
sentiment that lead to the issuance of the bond, they're harmed
<br>
financially by the success, but gain by the attainment of the goal by
<br>
more than that.)  While a holder is in the process of selling, her
<br>
incentive is to make the price higher.  After she's sold, she doesn't
<br>
care anymore.  Someone who doesn't hold and is thinking of buying
<br>
wants the price to be low.  After he buys, he wants the price to be
<br>
high.
