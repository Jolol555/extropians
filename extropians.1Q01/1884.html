<p><em>&gt; As far as I see you deny the very concept of meaning being meaningful.
</em><br>
<p>This interpretation is probably not what you intended, but - you're entirely
<br>
correct. There is no meaning. Even 'meaning' has no meaning, in a universal
<br>
sense of things.
<br>
<p>What I want to convey by the above words is this:
<br>
<p>Your text referred a lot to terms such as &quot;fundamental rights&quot; or
<br>
&quot;principles&quot;. But I do not admit *any* fundamental rights or principles
<br>
other than those that can be experimentally verified. If you say &quot;a person's
<br>
right to life&quot;, I am merely confused. I cannot answer an argument of yours
<br>
if it is based on &quot;a person's right to life&quot;, because I don't admit any such
<br>
universal rights or principles. You're relying on a fake authority, and I
<br>
don't recognize that authority - it's just as when a catholic leans on the
<br>
Bible in an argument with an atheist. No go.
<br>
<p>I *would* be able to consider your argument if you used more objective
<br>
terms.
<br>
<p>Anyway. I think I understand, and accept, your point of view on the vast
<br>
majority of issues at hand. So, no need to continue. I'm not sure if you
<br>
understand and accept my point of view, but if you don't care about that, I
<br>
don't care either. If you do care about it though, ask, and I will explain.
<br>
[Maybe in email so as not to aggravate the audience of this mailing list.]
