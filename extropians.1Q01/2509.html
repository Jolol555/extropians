<em>&gt; One of the saddest things I ever saw was an ethnography film about
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This sounds very much (but not precisely) like the notorious case of
<br>
&quot;Genie&quot;, as first documented by author and journalist Russ Rymer in
<br>
two successive issues of _The New Yorker_ in 1992.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My fists clench and unclench at the thought, and I feel rage wash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through me when I think about it. The parents would face worse at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my hands, and that psychologist would be in for major attitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjusting as well.
</em><br>
<p>Your rage might have been deliberately fanned by the film
<br>
you saw.  There were several sides to this story, as I recall,
<br>
and recriminations flew thick and fast among the parties
<br>
involved.  The parents (the father, in particular) had a little
<br>
more wrong with them than &quot;uncaring&quot; implies (not that that takes
<br>
away from the enormity of the wrong they committed against their
<br>
daughter).  It's true that, whatever happened, the story of
<br>
&quot;Genie&quot; is not as pretty or romantic as that of the woman
<br>
depicted by Jodie Foster in the movie _Nell_.
<br>
<p>See, for example
<br>
<a href="http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/hsbioethics/unit3_4.htm">http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/hsbioethics/unit3_4.htm</a>
<br>
(there are references at the end), or Google search
<br>
the keywords Rymer and Genie.
