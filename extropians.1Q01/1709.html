<em>&gt;Negotiable governemnt bonds redeemable when certain objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measures are met.  Do any of our resident experts have an opinion?
</em><br>
<p>Steve and Will -- Ronnie wrote me last April, after Will told him
<br>
about me, and his message to me got buried in my inbox, so I never
<br>
responded.  I'm sorry to have been so anti-social.
<br>
<p>Here's your idea:
<br>
<em>&gt;Social Policy Bonds would be issued by government, and would be redeemable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a fixed sum only when the specified social objective has been achieved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once issued, the bonds would be freely tradeable on the open market. Owning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bonds that can appreciate in value when a social goal becomes closer gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the bondholders an incentive to try to achieve that goal. Under a bond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regime bondholders would be free to choose and invent ways of solving social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems that are cost-effective and efficient.  ... passive investors ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'free-riders', hoping to benefit from any increase in the bond price without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually participating in any objective-achieving projects. But ... the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bonds these passive investors own, ... the more they would stand to lose ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they would be better off selling them, even at a loss. ... a big incentive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for large purchasers to buy the bonds. ... and large purchasers would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strong incentive to cooperate, to help achieve the targeted objective ...
</em><br>
<p>It is true that if someone holds enough such bonds, they can have an incentive
<br>
to achieve the social policy.  But I have four concerns about this proposal:
<br>
1) The bondholder needs to have private information about their chances of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;success.  If speculators know as much as the bondholder does about the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chances of success, the bond price would get bid up to a value consistent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with those chances, and the bondholder couldn't make any profits by 
<br>
actually
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuing success.  The key to bondholder profits is to *both* be able to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help achieve the social policy, *and* to know better than speculators how
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard one will try or how successful one may be.  So this approach shouldn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be used if one wants success with a high probability.
<br>
2) For every buyer there is a seller.  While a buyer has an incentive to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help the social policy, the seller has an incentive to hurt that policy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the seller can profit from that ability if they also have private
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information about how hard they will try or how successful they will be.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if the government just sells it once to the final bondholder, we only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to worry about giving the government incentives to hurt the policy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more other sales happen after that the more worries about harm.
<br>
3) You'd need to issue extremely large dollar amounts of bonds to have any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measurable effect on large policy goals, such as your example of regional
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air pollution.  There is no point in trying a small amount at first on big
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goals - you'd have to first try it on very small goals.
<br>
4) Choosing the amount of bonds to issue is tricky, and open to corruption.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine a town with one main factory causing pollution, and issuing bonds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose goal is reduction of town pollution.  Issue too few and nothing will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happen.  Issue too many and pollution will fall, but you will have paid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that company much more than you needed to to achieve the goal.  And the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fact that uncertainty is key as described in point 1 means that uncertainty
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about whether one offered too much or too little may be endemic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Social Policy Bonds allow governments to do what they are best at -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prescribing ends - and markets to do what they are best at - allocating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resources to meet these ends
</em><br>
<p>I have a different proposal based on this intuition at
