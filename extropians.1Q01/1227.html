<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; will be the ONLY AI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A: You don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Q: How does the first AI in its earliest moments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; struggling to come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terms with itself and learning how to manipulate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world, keep other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AIs from coming into existence in the meanwhile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (which will probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at least several years)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A: It can't.  Enforcement waits until it can -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; providing a window for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people to upload, and if necessary, escape the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dominating AI's sphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **I see people working to build an AI and making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress. I don't see the same progress toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading.
</em><br>
<p>I do.  In fact, I see more serious progress towards uploading than I do
<br>
towards AI - mainly because the upload research does not focus on
<br>
uploading per se, but on creating those technologies which will be
<br>
needed for uploading, while AI has not come to a consensus on why they
<br>
have failed thus far and started doing something about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Besides--once the thing goes critical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've lost control. That could take years, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds. You may not see it coming. The AI might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceal its progress, and so on.
</em><br>
<p>My point was that the AI *would not be able to* conceal its progress at
<br>
first.  You appear to have a concept of an all-knowing AI that knows
<br>
everything from the moment it is turned on.  I am saying that, given
<br>
current research paths, such an eventuality is practically impossible,
<br>
at least without lesser AIs first being created and tested.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; **After all--would YOU, trust US?
</em><br>
<p>Why, yes.  As far as I had to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, so you'll have to still keep working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world, providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for you and your kin, and generally making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'round.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever stop, you're superfluous to those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; haven't,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever form they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may take.  This is true with or without AIs, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; No. A Rembrandt is not superfluous--whether he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; contributes to making things go round or doesn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Same for a John Lennon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, but they do.  Art isn't superfluous: someone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to dream the dream.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **I suggest to you that art WILL be superfluous to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI--and that anything which cannot fathom the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art is unsuited to make our decisions for us. (Okay,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe this is an eccentric POV; I think it's valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And to appreciate art, you need emotions. And an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with emotions is unsuitable to make our decisions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us. And...)
</em><br>
<p>Some forms of art MAY be superfluous.  Do you have any evidence or
<br>
logical proof that it will?  Granted, I do not have any solid evidence
<br>
that it will not, except for the very limited AI I currently employ
<br>
that cares about nothing but music.  (Specifically: a music generator,
<br>
more of an expert system than a sentient AI.)  But, if that is the only
<br>
evidence on the table...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm talking about doing things for pure pleasure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that produces nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for anyone outside of the doer.  I.e., indulging in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; luxury, and letting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pleasure, as opposed to providing value to others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be the only thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that drives you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **Ah--but Rembrandt died a pauper BECAUSE his works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not 'provide value to others' in his time. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was in the judgement of his fellow humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine, if you can, what an AI would think of it.
</em><br>
<p>Imagine, if you can, what a random person would think of it.  Same dif:
<br>
the set of all AIs can potentially have as much or more variance as the
<br>
set of all intelligent humans currently living.
