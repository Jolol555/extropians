<p>
Here is an idea that I have been toying with recently.  We have 
<br>
earth-based frontiers that can be reached cheaper and earlier than 
<br>
space-based frontiers.  These might serve as practice areas where we 
<br>
can demonstrate viable space technologies in a safer environment. 
<br>
People could visit or study these environments to see what works and 
<br>
what doesn't.  We can then adapt these technologies to space.  Those 
<br>
that already live in these environments will already be experienced 
<br>
colonists in hostile environments.
<br>
<p>For example, bases on the Moon, Mars or the Asteroids might be 
<br>
underground to escape from radiation.  Could we build an underground 
<br>
city?  I'm thinking about deep underground, at least thousands of 
<br>
feet and maybe much more.  We would have to learn to tunnel from 
<br>
inside the base, shore up as we go, keep air-tight (or water-tight) 
<br>
as we go.  We would need to maintain temperature balance and oxygen 
<br>
levels.  We could try to use biosphere-type balancing to keep up 
<br>
levels.  We would have to develop remote telecommuting for jobs 
<br>
outside the base, or develop our own means of business from within 
<br>
the base.  We would have to learn to grow plants without natural 
<br>
sunlight.  We would have to adapt to living underground without going 
<br>
topside.  This would develop and demonstrate many requirements for 
<br>
underground space bases, but would be close enough to earth for 
<br>
visiters to see and to evacuate in case of emergency.  Maybe the 
<br>
technology developed there could be patented or somehow sold to help 
<br>
fund and advance space colonization.
<br>
<p>Many of the Gas Giants planets have oceans within their moons.  Could 
<br>
we create an undersea base in the middle of some ocean?  We would 
<br>
have to adapt to the cold and dark.  We would need to adapt to the 
<br>
pressure and build structures for that environment.  These would have 
<br>
to resist corrosion from constant water contact.  We would need to 
<br>
have regular access to the outside environment.  We would try to 
<br>
figure out how to grow plants in the cold, dark water.  We would need 
<br>
wetsuits that were heated, and would need to carry our own oxygen. 
<br>
We would want to learn to extract oxygen from the water, and safely 
<br>
use hydrogen fuel.  We would need to figure out a means of waste 
<br>
disposal that didn't contaminate the water around the base.  We even 
<br>
would have to explore and contend with new types of marine life not 
<br>
seen topside.  (Scientist estimate that most deep-sea marine life has 
<br>
not been observed.)  We would have to learn to anchor our bases to 
<br>
wet and possibly unstable surfaces.  We would need to develop water 
<br>
craft for transportation, and develop tools and building materials 
<br>
that work underwater.
<br>
<p>I think these two ideas merit further attention.  I predict that 
<br>
underground or undersea colonies would occur before colonizing other 
<br>
worlds.  I also think that the technologies developed in these two 
<br>
environments would be a precursor to space colonies.  These colonists 
<br>
would be seen as the forerunners of space colonists.  They may even 
<br>
invent the technologies required for space colonization, and may 
<br>
provide the largest number of space emigrants.  Any exports developed 
<br>
from these frontiers would be much easier to ship topside for profit. 
<br>
We could develop more efficient and more profitable exports later for 
<br>
overcoming the long-distance shipping to earth that space colonies 
<br>
would encounter.
