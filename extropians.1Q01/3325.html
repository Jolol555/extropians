<p><em>&gt; Greg, rather than being afraid, let's talk about this.

</em><br>

<em>&gt;  more we can debunk the irrationality of their claims if we do something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  about it, such as with our upcoming Extro conference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Let's look at the topics of this event and counter them extropically.
</em><br>
<p>First, my comment was intended to be a little humorous, invoking the ad 
<br>
campaign for an old horror movie (I can't even recall the object of the add . 
<br>
. .)
<br>
<p>Second, I agree with both of you that *a* right response is to work to 
<br>
organize a counterweight to these voices - and I look forward to seeing all 
<br>
of you at Extro5 this year :-)
<br>
<p>But finally, I think it's important to be aware of and REALLY understand how 
<br>
it is that the movement in opposition to technological progress is so 
<br>
effective in organizing and getting its message out.  Perhaps it is just a 
<br>
function of my professional work as an adversarial advocate, but I tend to 
<br>
focus on this kind of thing, i.e. researching and analyzing &quot;the other side&quot; 
<br>
as a tool to better advance my own.  So, I hope my friends here will indulge 
<br>
my taste for dissecting the Rifkinites.
<br>
<p>As I've written here before, the luddite point of view has some real 
<br>
advantages in the job of memetic competition.  The primary advantages I see 
<br>
lie in the question of who does the talking and rule-making in our societies. 
<br>
&nbsp;Regarding the former, for better or worse, the media IS overwhelmingly 
<br>
staffed with people who lack technical or scientific education and experience 
<br>
and whose attitudes are shaped by a culture inimical to values of progress.  
<br>
As a simple matter of the practicalities of career opportunities and personal 
<br>
talents, people tend to go into work in journalism from educational 
<br>
backgrounds in the humanities.  And as a fact of history, academic 
<br>
departments in the humanities in the West have been overwhelmingly staffed 
<br>
since the 1960s by professors who hold attitudes antithetical to 
<br>
Enlightenment values of reason and progress and who are deeply ignorant and 
<br>
suspicious of science, technology and enterprise.
<br>
<p>Rule-makers in the West also tend to come from similar educational 
<br>
backgrounds, and then tend to rise to positions of power through personality 
<br>
traits and long experience in behavior that has little need for knowledge or 
<br>
understanding of how science, technology and enterprise work.  Any doubt 
<br>
about this should be dispelled by the recent experience of California's 
<br>
hare-brained power &quot;deregulation&quot; scheme.
<br>
<p>Put these two factors together with the facts of the general population's 
<br>
deep ignorance of basic knowledge of science, technology and enterprise, and 
<br>
you have a deck that is stacked decidedly against rational development of 
<br>
science and technology policy.  In fact, viewed through this purely 
<br>
&quot;cultural&quot; lens, one would wonder how ANYTHING rational ever gets done.  The 
<br>
answer seems to lie in two things.  First, contrary to what the 
<br>
postmodernists would have us believe, the day to day activities of people 
<br>
engaged in the scientific method tend to work themselves out in practice 
<br>
largely in a cultural sphere insulated from the influence of &quot;culture&quot; in 
<br>
general.  Most scientific activity takes place in laboratories and journals 
<br>
that interface very little with the world inhabited by the denizens of 
<br>
legislatures and the popular media.  Only in the realms of public funding and 
<br>
explicit legislative fiat do the two worlds overlap.
<br>
<p>Second, as the history of the last 250 years in the West has proven, 
<br>
technological business enterprises produce tangible results in an extremely 
<br>
efficient manner that many people want and will pay for.  One can place a lot 
<br>
of &quot;cultural drag&quot; on this social mechanism and still obtain substantial 
<br>
fruits from the interaction of capitalism and science.
<br>
<p>The problem comes from the fact that this latter mechanism is inherently 
<br>
short-sighted when it comes to cultural expression.  The primary mode of that 
<br>
expression is advertising of goods and services available TODAY, not rational 
<br>
exposition of a philosophy that encourages on-going support for scientific 
<br>
and technological progress.  What I call &quot;the cultural horizon of capital&quot; 
<br>
tends to be limited to the economic realities of profitable returns on 
<br>
investment.  As the dot-commers have recently discovered to their great pain, 
<br>
that horizon is fairly short - on average it appears to be something on the 
<br>
order of two years, at most.  Interestingly, industries and specific 
<br>
enterprises that tend to make longer-term capital investments DO engage in 
<br>
more broad-based advertising.  Thus we see large chemical and industrial 
<br>
companies develop and promulgate advertising campaigns and slogans that point 
<br>
to longer-term progress (e.g. GE's &quot;we make good things come to light&quot;).
<br>
<p>There ARE some notable exceptions to these unfortunate trends and factors.  
<br>
Every once in a while, the realms of science, technology and industry spawn a 
<br>
capable spokesperson.  But a Carl Sagan seems to come along all too rarely.  
<br>
The confluence of a good grounding in the basics of the scientific method and 
<br>
the obvious truths of enterprise seldom seem to also meet up with a 
<br>
personality that has the instincts for showmanship that Dr. Sagan had.  Steve 
<br>
Allen's recent passing made me wonder at how rare such people are - and ask 
<br>
yourself how little impact Steve Allen had on popular culture.  Most people 
<br>
don't even know that he spent the better part of his life as a vigorous 
<br>
activist and communicator on behalf of the values that we share here.
<br>
<p>The simple facts are that the kinds of people who are drawn into scientific 
<br>
and technical fields tend to be TERRIBLE communicators in the way needed to 
<br>
have an impact on the culture at large.  While enterprise tends to attract 
<br>
better communicators, the facts of life in business are such that those 
<br>
communication skills tend to be focused on narrow and short-term messages.  
<br>
Even getting the people who could afford to fund the grooming of good 
<br>
spokespeople to recognize the need seems to be an uphill task.
<br>
<p>My intention is not to be pessimistic, but rather to be realistic.  We need 
<br>
to recognize that the deck of cultural communication and influence IS stacked 
<br>
against us.  Only working from that realization can we hope to succeed.
