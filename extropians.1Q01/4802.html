Ronald Bailey's latest dispatch on the anti-extropians.
<br>
<p>BTW, I have talked to Ronald about speaking at Extro-5, but as an 
<br>
East-coaster, funding his travel could be a problem if we don't get 
<br>
corporate sponsorship.
<br>
<p>The material below just reinforces what I recently wrote in my intro for 
<br>
Extro-5 at:

<em>&gt;Rebels Against the Future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Witnessing the birth of the global anti-technology movement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By Ronald Bailey, Reason Science Correspondent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Two weeks ago at the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Francis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, made a disturbing claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the future. &quot;Major anti-technology movements will be active in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;U.S. and elsewhere by 2030,&quot; he predicted Unfortunately, Collins is off by 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indeed, I may have witnessed the birth of the global anti-technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movement at this past weekend's International Forum on Globalization's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Teach-In on Technology and Globalization in New York City. Held at Hunter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;College on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the organizers said some 1,400
</em><br>
<em>&gt;registrants attended the two-day meeting. The speakers included an all-star
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cast of technophobes and other rebels against the future, featuring proud
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-declared luddites such as Kirkpatrick Sale, Jeremy Rifkin, Jerry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mander, Andrew Kimbrell, Paul Hawken, Pat Roy Mooney, Mae-Wan Ho, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Vandana Shiva.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If it's new, they hate it. What they fear and loathe most is biotechnology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but now some are beginning to train their sights on nanotechnology as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The audience consisted mostly of grizzled veterans of the civil rights,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;peace, and environmental movements from the 1960s and 1970s with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smattering of earnest youngsters hailing from too-cool college campuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;located in places like Vermont, Massachusetts, and Oregon. Whenever one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speakers revealed shocking truths about corporations (always invoked simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as they), the audience would murmur in horrified dismay: &quot;They can move
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genes between species!&quot; or &quot;They are patenting genes!&quot; or &quot;They have 1,200
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nanotech patents!&quot; It seems that few of the attendees had bothered to read a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paper for the past few years, so all this was news to them. &quot;Progressives&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they may call themselves, but they certainly haven't been keeping up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The goal of the Teach-In, according to conference organizer and IFG head
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jerry Mander (best known for his book Four Arguments for the Elimination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Television), is to &quot;bring together the protest movement born in Seattle with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the leading critics of technologies, luddites if you will.&quot; In this, Mander
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly succeeded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So what are they afraid of? They generally fear &quot;technology's symbiotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relationship with corporate power,&quot; according to Mander. He doesn't much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;care for the Internet because he thinks &quot;it's facilitating the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;centralization of unregulated corporate power in history.&quot; Besides the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet, &quot;now we have biotechnology and its younger sibling nanotechnology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which can potentially redesign nature from the atomic level up,&quot; declared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mander. &quot;With these technologies, nothing will be outside of corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control. They will achieve the full realization of a bionic society.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Neo-luddite and bioregionalist Kirkpatrick Sale warned that &quot;electronic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetic technologies are bound to have earth-shaking, even earth-shattering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effects.&quot; He continued, &quot;All you have to lose are your boxes -- the boxes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your homes, on your desks, on your laps. We now know that they are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pandora's boxes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Randy Hayes, head of the Rainforest Action Network, decried biotech as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;most uncontrollable mass experiment the planet as ever seen.&quot; Rich Hayes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;director of the Exploratory Initiative on the New Human Genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Technologies, fears that &quot;the development and use of genetic technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will irrevocably change human life and destabilize human identity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;function.&quot; If that weren't bad enough, &quot;most chillingly, as these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technologies are being developed, a political and ideological movement is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rising that celebrates the techno-eugenic posthuman future,&quot; warned Hayes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He specifically cited REASON magazine as being at the forefront of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pro-biotechnology movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Computers are a colonizing technology,&quot; pronounced Chet Bowers, an adjunct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;professor in the Environmental Studies Department at the University of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oregon. He further warned that &quot;computers profoundly alter how we think and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inevitably reduce our ability to understand nature and cultures other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our own.&quot; Bowers decried Hans Moravec's vision of the future in which people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could download their consciousnesses into computers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pat Mooney, head of the Canadian Rural Advancement Foundation International
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(RAFI) wowed a workshop of earnest &quot;progressives&quot; by painting a vision of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the nanotechnological future that would make Eric Drexler, the godfather of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nanotech and author The Engines of Creation proud. &quot;Although it's a long way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;off, they are moving toward creating nano-assemblers that could manufacture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything,&quot; explained Mooney. &quot;You could take materials from sewage, air,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;water, anything to build what you want.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He added, &quot;Just read the White House press release from January 23 last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;year. It promises that nanotechnology could clean up the environment, end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hunger, cure disease, and extend life. It's scary.&quot; Scary?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So what do they want to do? First and foremost, they want to organize.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nearly every speaker mentioned how important it was for so-called civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justice, environmental justice, green, peace, and other civil society groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to join together on an action program to control or halt progress in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development of all the derided technologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Specifically, Rich Hayes demanded &quot;an immediate global ban on human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reproductive cloning, an immediate global ban on manipulating genes that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pass on to our children, and accountable and effective regulation of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other human genetic technologies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jeremy Rifkin called for &quot;a strict global moratorium, no release of GMOs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(genetically modified organisms) into the environment.&quot; Rifkin argued that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;the gene pool is a shared commons which should be administered as a trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for all humanity.&quot; He would &quot;prohibit any patents on genes, tissues, cells,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organs, organisms,&quot; and advocates a global tax on human gene therapies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biotech drugs, the proceeds of which would be distributed to the developing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Activist Stephanie Mills, who became famous when she announced as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;valedictorian of her class at Mills College in 1969 that the world was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such bad shape that she would not have children, demanded that society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broadly adopt the &quot;precautionary principle,&quot; the notion that before any new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development in science and technology can be used, it must be shown to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no negative impact. Technology proponents &quot;are still arguing against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensible idea that new chemicals and new technologies should be presumed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guilty until proven innocent,&quot; declared Mills. &quot;No wonder there are luddites
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still among us,&quot; she added.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Martin Teitel, a philosopher who directs the anti-biotech activist group the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Council for Responsible Genetics, was quite explicit about what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precautionary principle could do to stop technological progress. &quot;How could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any scientist prove that a biotech crop was completely safe without field
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trials which is what the precautionary principle would require?&quot; he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asked. That's just fine, Teitel admitted, because &quot;politically it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult for me to go around saying that I want to shut this science down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so it's safer for me to say something like 'it needs to be done safely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before releasing it.'&quot; Requiring biotechnologists to prove a negative under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the guise of implementing the precautionary principle means that &quot;they don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get to do it period,&quot; Teitel explained. In other words, Lie to the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about what your real intentions are. Is that what he's teaching his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy students?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To stop the technological juggernaut they fear, the luddites at the Teach-In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know that they must stop the global process of economic integration and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological progress it encourages. Free trade is, of course, anathema.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;John Cavanagh, director of the far-left think tank the Institute for Policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Studies, says that economic policies and regulations should favor &quot;small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activities, local markets, local communities with livelihoods connected to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;local economic production.&quot; Sarah Anderson, also from IPS, warned that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;online shopping is too easy and encourages overconsumption.&quot; Anderson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worries that &quot;the United States is using the allure of e-commerce to push
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developing countries into accepting the same old free market ideas.&quot; Jerry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mander actually recommended that countries return to the old import
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substitution model of economic development which bankrupted most of Africa
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;This is the big wrestling match of the 21st century,&quot; declared Rifkin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For once, he's right. Whether wilfully or out of sheer ignorance, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;congregants in Manhattan this past weekend dismiss any and all evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the human race has progressed over the past 100 years, much less the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1,000; the longer life expectancies, higher standards of living, and cleaner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environments that are everywhere becoming the rule and not the exception for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the masses have seemingly made no impression (nor have the economic forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that make such things possible). The hopeful future of humanity freed from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disease, disability, hunger, ignorance, poverty, and inequity depends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beating back the forces of know-nothing reaction such as those assembled at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this weekend's Teach-In. The struggle for the future begins now.&quot;
</em><br>
