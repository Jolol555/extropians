<p>Fair enough, on the face of it. However, the story I was quoting from

carried extra negative memetic freight. Here's some more:

<p><em>&gt;Experts Doubt That Extreme Life Expectancy Possible for Humans 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;by Paul Recer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Associated Press
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;Claims by some scientists that humans in this century will have a life
</em><br>
expectancy of 100 or even 120 are not realistic and not supported by the
<br>
trends measuring the rates of death, said S. Jay Olshansky of the
<br>
University of Illinois, Chicago. 
<br>
<em>&gt;&quot;We anticipate that many people here today will live long enough to
</em><br>
witness a life expectancy of 85 years, but everybody alive today will be
<br>
long dead before a life expectancy of 100 is achieved, if ever,&quot; said
<br>
Olshansky. 
<br>
<em>&gt;The researcher was the head of a panel of experts that on Sunday analyzed
</em><br>
trends in human life expectancy at the national meeting of the American
<br>
Association for the Advancement of Science. 
<br>
<em>&gt;Olshansky said there are no &quot;magic potions, hormones, antioxidants, forms
</em><br>
of genetic engineering or biomedical technologies that exist today that
<br>
would permit a life expectancy of 120 or 150 years as some people have
<br>
claimed.&quot; 
<br>
<em>&gt;Leonard Hayflick, an expert on aging at the University of California, San
</em><br>
Francisco, denounced what he called &quot;outrageous claims&quot; by some scientists
<br>
that humans are capable to living well past 100 years. 
<br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Superlongevity,&quot; he said &quot;is simply not possible.&quot;
