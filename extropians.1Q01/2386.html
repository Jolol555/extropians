<p>
On re-reading my earlier post in response to Charlie Stross's human rights 
<br>
nature, I see that it comes across as more negative than I actually felt.
<br>
<p>I enjoyed your earlier post on human rights, Charlie and agree with your 
<br>
statement that there is no such thing as a natural right derived from human 
<br>
nature. I agree that it's more useful (and accurate, I'd add) to view 
<br>
rights as emerging from social interaction.
<br>
<p>The point about which I disagree with you (and I'm not sure we disagree all 
<br>
that much--it's difficult to express such elusive concepts) is the one you 
<br>
made about there being no workable definition of human nature. At least I 
<br>
interpreted what you wrote to mean this. I generally prefer to avoid the 
<br>
word &quot;nature&quot; because it's been used in ways that render it nearly 
<br>
meaningless.
<br>
<p>I do think there are certain traits that all normal humans share and that 
<br>
these traits can shed light on which social systems are likely to work 
<br>
better than others.
<br>
