<p>The thing to do is not to study them, but to study successful methods.
<br>
<p>I've worked at Libertarian Party booths at fairs and learned that being
<br>
personable, giving information but not arguing, and not be annoying often
<br>
work best.
<br>
<p>One thing I've noticed does not work is to start a public debate.  Often
<br>
people who were antilibertarian would try to do this and it took time off
<br>
talking to other people.  I learned this through experience.  The more time
<br>
you spend arguing with a person is less time spent talking to others who
<br>
might be more receptive.
<br>
<p>The best experience I had was at Lollapolluza concert.  It might be better
<br>
to target that audience -- teen and twentysomethings.  They are invariably
<br>
more open minded.  (Yeah, we can find closed minded youths and open minded
<br>
geriatrics, but, on the whole, the tendency is for people to become less
<br>
open to new ideas as they age.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
