<p><em>&gt;I was not writing to defend communism, but to point out that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one-liner &quot;history shows that communism doesn't work&quot; can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applied to capitalism as well.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense, capitalism isn't perfect, nothing is, but it works far
<br>
better than anything else that has been tried.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This means that, in a sense, the United States is as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socialist as capitalist.  The long conflict between the USSR and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US was not an ideological battle between capitalism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communism.  It was a power struggle between two socialist nations.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense again, lets try arguing from definitions:
<br>
<p>Capitalism: An economic system in which investment in and ownership
<br>
of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is
<br>
made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations.
<br>
<p>The U.S in spades, note that there is no overide by government crap
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p>Socialism: A theory or system of social organization in which the
<br>
means of production and distribution of goods are owned and
<br>
controlled collectively, or by the government.
<br>
<p>Doesn't even remotely apply to the U.S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We should not be blinded by patriotic or ideological propaganda. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We live in a mixed society, part capitalist and part socialist.
</em><br>
<p>Lets not be blinded by incorrect notions of what capitalism, and
<br>
socialism are, definitions are on the table, let's see you prove
<br>
it.
