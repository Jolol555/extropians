&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;best evidence&quot; I observed on FOX's &quot;Moon Hoax&quot; program
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that was used to support the claim that the Apollo missions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were a hoax was two Apollo 15 photos with the same mountains
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the background and yet the lunar module (LM) was only in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the foreground of one of the two photos. The program said:
<br>
<p>FOX Narrator: &quot;These two photos seem to have the same mountain
<br>
backdrop, yet the lunar module was only visible in one of them.
<br>
Seemingly impossible since the Lem never moved, and its based
<br>
remained even after the mission. Some suggest the same artificial
<br>
backdrop was used when shooting two entirely separate pictures.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;FOX showed: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/MoonFOX5.gif">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/MoonFOX5.gif</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and this: <a href="http://users.erols.com/igoddard/MoonFOX3.gif">http://users.erols.com/igoddard/MoonFOX3.gif</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I posted the following explanation for this anomaly, which I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have since confirmed with evidence presented following this:
<br>
<p>Gee, the more you think about this &quot;anomaly&quot; the less anomalous
<br>
it gets. The LM is closer to the astronauts than the hills or
<br>
mountains behind. Each of the two photos in question was clearly
<br>
taken from slightly different angles. Being close, the LM is
<br>
fast to move out of the camera frame as the photographer changes
<br>
location, yet the same movement only shifts the mountains a touch.
<br>
So the photo without the LM is explainable as the same mountains
<br>
seen from a position in which the LM is not in the view finder.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That explanation is confirmed by the following evidence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the NASA site I found the two photos FOX showed:
<br>
(A) <a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075727.jpg">http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075727.jpg</a>
<br>
(B) <a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075728.jpg">http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075728.jpg</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the following three graphics together form a 360 degree
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;panoramic view of the area. Image 2 below shows the mountains
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;seen in images A and B above -- they're a section of the full
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain range toward the right of image 2 below. Observe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that in image 2 the lunar module (LM) isn't visible in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;foreground in front of the mountains from this view. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mountains are obviously very large and far away since the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;camera has moved to a position about 100 yards behind the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;LM seen in photo A above, yet the mountains are similar.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The LM is behind the camera as it faces the mountains and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thus it is visible 180 degrees opposite in images 1 and 3:
<br>
<p>(1) <a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075751.jpg">http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075751.jpg</a>
<br>
(2) <a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075752.jpg">http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075752.jpg</a>
<br>
(3) <a href="http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075749.jpg">http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/images/pao/AS15/10075749.jpg</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the &quot;anomaly&quot; of the two photos shown on FOX as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence of fake background is explained by the mountains
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;being so large they can be seen from many angles and each
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;point of view can have a unique set of foreground contents,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the shape of the hills hardly changes even though the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;viewer's foreground will have significantly changed. This
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;panorama view nullifies what I saw as the &quot;best evidence&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(assuming it had validity) presented on the FOX program.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I pasted each of those 3 graphics last listed together
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and they do form a continuos 360-degree panoramic view,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hence the LM is visible in 1 and 3 due to full rotation.
