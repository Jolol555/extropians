&nbsp;As we near the knee of the Ramp, all people

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have been thinking about this recently, in part due to my addiction to
<br>
movies.  Older movies, as someone noted previously, tend to move more
<br>
slowly.  Today's movies are a whirlwind of sights and sounds compared to
<br>
even _Citizen Kane_.  This is often referred to as &quot;MTV-like&quot; in reviews.
<br>
It is definitely correlated with youth, which brings me to my theory:
<br>
<p>It seems by many indications that we are culturally on the steepening slope
<br>
of the Law of Accelerating Returns Curve.  This means that change is coming
<br>
increasingly faster, in many areas of life.  The changes experienced by
<br>
those, like my great-grandmother, who lived this entire century, are an
<br>
oft-quoted example of the accelerating pace of change.
<br>
<p>I submit that the MTV-like frenetic pace of entertainment, and youth
<br>
culture, is a reaction to, and perhaps an adaptation for, this change.
<br>
Information is coming in from all fronts, and the amount of information
<br>
available on any topic is increasing to the point that it is difficult to
<br>
absorb it all.  Speaking from experience, studying Neuroscience is like the
<br>
metaphorical drink from the fire hose.  Perhaps this attention-deficit-like
<br>
change in culture is a memetic adaptation that is increasingly selected for
<br>
as science, technology, and life moves faster and faster.
<br>
<p>Thoughts?
