<br>
<p>The director of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science take's us on
<br>
an interesting trip through a possible future of personal
<br>
computing.
<br>
<p>I thought this book did well when it stayed on the technical
<br>
material, and future scenarios, and faltered when it tried to lay
<br>
out social policy.
<br>
<p>After a failed attempt to introduce information technology in the
<br>
third world, the author makes this observation:
<br>
<p>&quot;Like others who have tried to do something in this area, we, too,
<br>
came to the realization that the lack of communications, computers,
<br>
and training is not the primary problem. The bigger obstacles are
<br>
the same that have kept the poor from rising above poverty
<br>
throughout history. Lack of education is at the helm. It is
<br>
followed by lack of transportation, power, and telecommunications;
<br>
absence of capital; misuse of whatever resources may be available;
<br>
government inertia; and cultural taboos. Moreover, basic concerns
<br>
over food, shelter, and health dominate poor people's plans and
<br>
actions, as they should, ahead of the less tangible promises of
<br>
information technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>Excellent, and yet a few paragraphs later, he contradicts himself:
<br>
<p>&quot; If the world has to hold out until developing nations, and the
<br>
poor in the industrial world's inner cities, fix in serial fashion
<br>
the social, political, and economic problems that plague them, we
<br>
will be in for a very long wait. What we must do instead is help
<br>
through donations, government aid, personal and corporate
<br>
contributions, tax credits, loans, and all the mechanisms we can
<br>
muster to improve education and infrastructure.&quot;
<br>
<p>Huh? What about the misuse of whatever resources, and cultural
<br>
taboos of two paragraphs ago?
<br>
<p>I also like this observation:
<br>
<p>&quot; These observations and concerns were amplified by and MIT
<br>
Laboratory for Computer Science survey about the uses of
<br>
information technology in the developing world in 1999. The results
<br>
showed that the biggest recent successes in developing countries,
<br>
disguised under all sorts of information technology experiments,
<br>
actually involved the introduction and use of POTS-plain old
<br>
telephone service.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nevermind, it is still a very interesting book, I particularly
<br>
enjoyed the look at LCS's Project Oxygen.
<br>
<p><p>Very interesting.
