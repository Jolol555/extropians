<p>The following article appeared in the The Independent, 29th March 2000.

<p>THE BUSINESS WORLD 
<br>
<p>In e-money we trust, all others pay cash 
<br>
<p>Has the internet freed us of the need for money? 
<br>
<p>Diane Coyle 
<br>
<p>Nowhere is the allure of money more tangible than in the gold vaults of
<br>
the 
<br>
Bank of England. These vast pillared halls, deep within the huge and 
<br>
impressive walls of the Threadneedle Street fortress, glitter with rack 
<br>
after rack of ingots piled high and stretching as far as the eye can
<br>
see. 
<br>
<p>The Government decision last year to sell a small fraction of its gold 
<br>
reserves was greeted with outrage in many quarters. For many people, not 
<br>
least the gold producers, the authorities' commitment to gold, in some 
<br>
sense, signals that its money is not funny money. 
<br>
<p>But British currency has not been linked to gold for half a century, and
<br>
it 
<br>
has floated freely with no rigid anchor for 25 years. Nowhere in the
<br>
world 
<br>
economy is money anything to do with gold or any other real commodity.
<br>
In 
<br>
fact money has a diminishing physical presence in the weightless world. 
<br>
Although most people still use crinkly notes and jangling coins in daily 
<br>
life, the vast majority of financial transactions are in cyberspace. And 
<br>
the number of transactions is rocketing by the day. 
<br>
<p>These electronic impulses represent the currencies issued by national 
<br>
governments, which retain a monopoly over the issuance of money. But
<br>
this 
<br>
combination of old state monopoly and free-wheeling electronic
<br>
marketplace 
<br>
is odd. 
<br>
<p>The recurrent crises in the financial markets may be a signal about 
<br>
something unsustainable about the present monetary arrangements. Maybe
<br>
what 
<br>
is unsustainable is the remnant of corporatism represented by
<br>
nationalised 
<br>
currencies. 
<br>
<p>This is a possibility raised in a fascinating, though dense book, The 
<br>
Memory Bank by Keith Hart (Profile Books). The author, an
<br>
anthropologist, 
<br>
says the internet has made it possible for the middle-class masses to 
<br>
escape the state monopoly of money. He believes the main beneficiaries
<br>
of 
<br>
states' issuance of cash are criminals, because anybody shipping large 
<br>
amounts of cash is more likely to be a drugs or arms dealer than a
<br>
citizen 
<br>
with a legitimate purpose. 
<br>
<p>Mr. Hart joins a handful of radical thinkers in suggesting most national 
<br>
monies are history. There are many examples of the development of
<br>
private 
<br>
monies, thanks to new technologies. 
<br>
<p>My babysitting circle uses paper Monopoly money, borrowed from the board 
<br>
game, but the obvious electronic one is airmiles, issued by airlines. 
<br>
Mostly, these are still only used to buy flights, but there are
<br>
secondary 
<br>
transactions and United Airlines has used them to pay its advertising 
<br>
agency fees. 
<br>
<p>Internet currencies can also be given as gifts for making online
<br>
purchases. 
<br>
Increasingly local economic networks issue electronic units of account
<br>
as a 
<br>
currency for payment for goods and services. Many Local Exchange Trading 
<br>
Schemes have these, and in the US there are similar Time Dollars
<br>
schemes. 
<br>
At this point the level-headed reader will say small schemes like these
<br>
are 
<br>
all very well, but most people will want to be paid by their employer in 
<br>
&quot;proper&quot; money, and shopkeepers want currency too. 
<br>
<p>There are good reasons for national currencies. Money, as basic
<br>
economics 
<br>
tells us, acts as a unit of account, a medium of exchange and a store of 
<br>
value. So new private electronic currencies will continue to be parallel 
<br>
currencies. 
<br>
<p>One of the big populist selling points for the euro is the absence of
<br>
the 
<br>
bother of acquiring foreign currencies when crossing an increasingly 
<br>
notional geographical border. Almost anyone buying over the internet
<br>
will 
<br>
have paid in US dollars. 
<br>
<p>Last year's Nobel laureate in economics, Robert Mundell, is an advocate
<br>
of 
<br>
an ultimate move towards a single global currency, although his argument 
<br>
does not involve the internet. 
<br>
<p>He is the extreme of conventional opinion, but almost everybody
<br>
recognises, 
<br>
since the global financial crisis of 1997-98, that countries face a
<br>
stark 
<br>
choice about their currency. 
<br>
<p>Either you go your own way with a freely floating exchange rate and
<br>
suffer 
<br>
the penalties of having a small and volatile currency in a growing sea
<br>
of 
<br>
transactions in only the major currencies. 
<br>
<p>Or peg your currency absolutely and irrevocably to one of the big ones, 
<br>
probably the dollar or perhaps the euro. For the third way in monetary 
<br>
policy leads off the edge of a cliff. 
<br>
<p>The great Maynard Keynes said money in a modern economy was the managed 
<br>
outcome of the links between states and markets, that it is a social 
<br>
construct, not a natural phenomenon. The information revolution is 
<br>
rewriting the interplay between governments and markets. 
<br>
<p>This is in its infancy, so it is hard to predict what money will be by
<br>
the 
<br>
middle of this century. Keith Hart, in his book, suggests it will look
<br>
more 
<br>
like the private bills of credit merchants used to issue in the 16th 
<br>
century and earlier, a record of mutual obligation and trust between 
<br>
private individuals. 
<br>
<p>Whatever shape &quot;real money takes, the gold in the vaults will certainly
<br>
end 
<br>
up as a tourist attraction adding sparkle to the Bank of England's
<br>
museum.
