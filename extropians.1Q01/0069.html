Well I think Damien and others should take into account the user interface
<br>
requirements of their readers when attempting to &quot;bridge the divide&quot;. I
<br>
mean, it's no good if it's so obfuscated (for the eggheads) that they can't
<br>
even understand it, or want to go to the trouble to do so. Speak more plainly
<br>
is my plea.

<em>&gt; &gt;  Damien, I cannot make out *what* the heck you are talking about.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  consider the source.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer, I find this an interesting comment in light of a discussion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Barbara Lamar, Natasha and I have been having off-list regarding &quot;the Two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cultures&quot;, i.e. the famous divide between the humanities and arts on the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand and the cultural world of science and technology on the other.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passage from Damien's post you quote above is perfectly clear to me.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is because of which side of the &quot;Two Cultures&quot; divide I come from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having spent a lifetime in study of literature, philosophy and history, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to thinking in the terms with which Damien expresses himself here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this passage Damien is expressing himself in terms of (really very slight)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphor and analogy (&quot;barking our shins&quot;), two powerful tools in the kit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who work on &quot;our&quot; side of the divide.  Interestingly, and apropos of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the discussion we've been having off-list, Damien is actually addressing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject of the divide itself in this passage, i.e. he is talking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction of the empirical world with which science and technology is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned (&quot;the Real&quot;) and the world of subjective experience which is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main object of works of &quot;symbol and culture&quot;.  Ironically, I think the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Damien was making was that clever self-reference - which he took the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution to your riddle to be - is in fact corrosive of the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounding dialogue in the empirical world of barked shins and repeatable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment.  I think his larger point (the whole book from he quotes is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making its way to the top of my list) is that a pragmatic judgment from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility in the empirical world ultimately drains the quagmire of self-doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and self-reference to which so much of modern &quot;culture&quot; has been reduced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the practice of post-modernist &quot;deconstruction&quot;.  Ultimately, Damien is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working to bridge the chasm between &quot;the Two Cultures&quot;.  So I think you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should try again to make out what he's talking about.
