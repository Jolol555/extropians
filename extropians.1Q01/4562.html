Dealing With Problem Programmers
<br>
Steve McConnell

<br>
<p>&quot;...In addition to attitudinal differences, significant productivity
<br>
differences among programmers have been well documented. In the
<br>
first study on the subject, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant found
<br>
differences of more than 20 to 1 in the time required by different
<br>
developers to debug the same problem (&quot;Exploratory Experimental
<br>
Studies Comparing Online and Offline Programming Performance.&quot;
<br>
Communications of the ACM, January 1968).  This was among a group
<br>
of programmers who each had at least 7 years of professional
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p>This basic result-demonstrating at least 10 to 1 differences in
<br>
productivity-has been reproduced numerous times, but I think it
<br>
understates the real productivity differences among practicing
<br>
programmers. Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister conducted a coding war
<br>
game in which 166 programmers were tasked to complete the same
<br>
assignment (&quot;Programmer Performance and the Effects of the
<br>
Workplace,&quot; in Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on
<br>
Software Engineering, August 1985). They found that the different
<br>
programmers exhibited differences in productivity of about 5 to 1
<br>
on the same small project. From a problem employee point of view,
<br>
the most interesting result of the study is that 13 of the 166
<br>
programmers didn't finish the project at all-that's almost 10
<br>
percent of the programmers in the sample.
<br>
<p>In a study with similar findings, Bill Curtis presented a group of
<br>
60 professional programmers with what he characterized as a
<br>
&quot;simple&quot; debugging task (&quot;Substantiating Programmer Variability,&quot;
<br>
Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 69, no. 7, 1981). In spite of its
<br>
simplicity, 6 of the professional programmers weren't able to
<br>
complete the task, and data on their performance was excluded from
<br>
the results of the study. Curtis observed order of magnitude
<br>
differences among the programmers who were able to complete the
<br>
task....&quot;
<br>
<p>20 to 1 productivity differences?  This is astounding.  Is this a
<br>
general phenomenon?  If you were to take 100 professional authors and
<br>
given them some writing task, would 10 of them be unable to complete the
<br>
task at all?  What about engineers in other fields--mechanical,
<br>
electrical, civil--do they exhibit a similarly wide range of competence?
<br>
<p><p>McConnell attributes most of the difference not to skill but to
<br>
programmer attitude.  He recommends early design and code reviews, and
<br>
firing employees &quot;....who don't want to share their work, who won't
<br>
accept teammates' suggestions, who won't take the time to review other
<br>
team members' work-in short, team members who are generally
<br>
uncooperative....&quot;
<br>
<p>While I agree that poor attitude inhibits productivity, it doesn't seem
<br>
an adequate explanation for the wide range of performance in the
<br>
artificial war games and exercises described above.  For example, in
<br>
Curtis's experiment, presumably the programmers worked alone, and
<br>
volunteered to participate in the study--so lack of social skills and
<br>
poor attitude would seem to play a minor role.  
<br>
<p>What have been you're experiences with poorly performing programmers? 
<br>
What did you find helped increase the programmer's productivity?
