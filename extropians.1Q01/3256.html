Spike writes, rearding surveillance:
<br>
<em>&gt; So how do we prevent it from invading homes?  Not by police but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by nosy or horny neighbors for instance, in the form of microcams
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried by insects or mice.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is less likely to have as much impact as public cameras, for
<br>
a few reasons.  First, the current trend is towards public installations,
<br>
and police cameras will have more impact on people's behavior than illegal
<br>
peeping toms.  Second, the technological improvements necessary to have
<br>
cameras that would be this small and yet still have power, transmitting
<br>
and/or recording capabilities will take longer than those for stationary
<br>
and human carried cameras.  And third, by the time you have insect-sized
<br>
cameras invading people's homes there may be technological countermeasures
<br>
that are possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And regarding public places, how about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrooms and locker rooms?  Do we just blow off ever expecting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cover our nudity?  Im OK with that.  Are you?  spike
</em><br>
<p>That's a good question.  There have been a number of cases in recent
<br>
years in which people secretly placed cameras in such places and then
<br>
put the photos on the internet.  This is presently illegal and when
<br>
caught these people are prosecuted.
<br>
<p>We all remember the sad 1997 case in which 7 year old Sherrice Iverson
<br>
was killed in a Nevada casino bathroom by Jeremy Strohmeyer.  As it
<br>
happened, Strohmeyer was caught due to the video surveillance system
<br>
in the casino outside the bathroom, which of course exists primarily to
<br>
catch gambling cheaters.  His photo was publicized and people recognized
<br>
him and turned him in.
<br>
<p>It could be that cameras will not have to invade bathrooms and locker
<br>
rooms in order to deter crime, if there are systems which can see people
<br>
going in and out.  Or maybe just the &quot;public&quot; areas of bathrooms outside
<br>
the stalls would be covered.  Based on longstanding American standards
<br>
of morality, I don't think we will see video surveillance of locker
<br>
rooms and the insides of toilet stalls in this country.  Some European
<br>
countries have less of a nudity taboo (and perhaps more tolerance for
<br>
observation) so the answer may be different there.
