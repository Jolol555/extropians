</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Governments can do all of these. What powers corporations do have that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; force that government has. End that monopoly and you end both government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AND corporate abuses. Follow the power. Where is it most concentrated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is only true in theory. In practice, there is plenty of evidence that corporations do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage in such unhealthy activities as coercion, bribery, murder and genocide. 
</em><br>
<p>Name one corporation that did not have police powers granted it by a
<br>
government that has ever committed genocide. You can't. Coercion,
<br>
bribery, and murder occur when a corporation is sufficiently cozy with
<br>
government to expect no significant investigation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't need a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government to hire thugs and mercenaries to do your dirty work. 
</em><br>
<p>But you do need a government to force private citizens to sit there and
<br>
take it without any force in kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if you own the media, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police, and the government, who exactly can make sure there are repercussions for your actions?
</em><br>
<p>You are arguing my side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And with no government of any kind, who is going to stop corporate gangs from doing whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they want? 
</em><br>
<p>Each individual would be capable of defending themselves against
<br>
corporate gangs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, I'm not saying that the corporation is inherently bad, or that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations are engaging in these activities, just that some are and do. The only reason power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears to be the most concentrated in government is because that's what the powers that be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want us to see. If the US government (for example) actually reflected the will of the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as it is supposed to do in theory), and if the people were truly informed and cared about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was going in their own backyards and the world, then maybe these abuses couldn't take place. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know. Perhaps this is too much to hope for.
</em><br>
<p>Corporate abuses occur because they have the power of government to
<br>
support them. Remove the sovereign monopoly of government and corporate
<br>
use of force withers away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, yes, and thanks to imperialism, 1/4 of the human race is no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; burning its wives to death when their spouses die. I don't see that as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sorry, but the ethnocentric position of your argument sounds like a rationalization for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppression to me. Oddly enough, this is similar to the rationalization used by Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missionaries, i.e. that these people were not living correctly and it's our job to better their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives and help them see the light. What hogwash. It's easy to pluck the most extreme examples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and, frankly, not very good ones) out of the air to justify something that has already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened. I'm just not buying it.
</em><br>
<p>Yet you speak of genocide. Wife burning on the scale that occured in
<br>
India prior to British conquest was on the same scale as many genocides
<br>
that have occured in history. It belittles women's rights to say that
<br>
this practice is not genocidal-equivalent and that it should be
<br>
protected as some sort of 'cultural tradition' that is worthy of
<br>
respect. Its pathetic relativist crap like that that is truly hogwash.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thanks to imperialism, despotic insular states like Japan and China
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opened up and modernized. Thanks to imperialism, four of the ten most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stable nations on earth exist entirely due to colonization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And at what price to the people who didn't want what the white gods had to offer? This is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shortsighted and arrogant it almost defies belief. How can you claim to be a libertarian when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it appears you think it's okay to selectively apply liberty? How exactly has colonization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improved the lives of native Americans?
</em><br>
<p>There are, in fact, as many Native Americans in north america today as
<br>
there were before the conquistadors. Native Americans today live an
<br>
average of twice as long as their forebears, with a far higher standard
<br>
of living.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Local opposition to 'imperialism' is typically a matter of one despot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and his henchmen getting pissed off that they aren't allowed to abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their serfs like they used to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only to become serfs of the imperialists. This is a circular argument, and not a very good one.
</em><br>
<p>Whether they become serfs or not is irrelevant. Were they abused by the
<br>
imperialists more than they were under their local rulers? Look at Hong
<br>
Kong, Singapore, and many other asian nations that were formerly
<br>
colonies. The local rulers claim that political repression is a
<br>
'cultural tradition' when westerners protest against it. Bollocks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2000-3000 years is nothing to evolution, and 'culture' is a thin veneer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that typically dissapears entirely with sufficient stress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Despite the evidence that this happens (I won't dispute it), I don't share your rather dark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view of humanity. While culture is often a thin veneer, it's really all we have (of course, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including science and technology under this rubric) to separate us from the other animals. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, if we have the strength of character to use it wisely.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have a dark view of humanity, or of evolution. It seems you have
<br>
a dark view of what I see as a natural system. Like a communalist, you
<br>
assume that the natural system is dark, harsh, evil and bad in a very
<br>
Calvinist/Puritan sense. 
<br>
<p>Human nature doesn't need to be changed, it needs to be informed. It
<br>
doesn't need to be chained, it needs to be unleashed and empowered.
<br>
People are at their best when left to their own devices. It is only when
<br>
you confiscate liberty and concentrate power that you get abuses and
<br>
corruption arises.
