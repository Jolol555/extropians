<p>
In addition to being an extropian, I feel, in light of the scathing reeming
<br>
I have received in some defense of MS, that I must also admit to being a 3rd
<br>
level priest in the Phoenix, AZ branch of the BillGateseistic-AllTruth
<br>
Church of the Living Window.  As a naive youngster coming out of college
<br>
with a worthless degree, I fell easily into this dark church - they promised
<br>
me money, women and a good IDE for eternity.  I was helpless to resist.
<br>
<p>Slowly though, I am beginning to see the light.  I am peeling apart the
<br>
dark, dark window tinting which I had never seen before.  Suddenly I realize
<br>
that I have spent the last 5 years of my life creating useless toys that
<br>
through the evil, dark magic of BillGatesSteveBallmer only *appeared* to
<br>
work or solve any problems.  How many wasted hours I must have spent
<br>
zombie-like as I waited, unseeing while countless servers crashed!  Oh woe!
<br>
Woe is me!
<br>
<p>As the curtains of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt are cast aside, I throw
<br>
bricks through the horrible Windows(tm)!  Take that!  And That!  Now, I
<br>
shall let the cool breeze of unfettered, non-Microsoft software into my
<br>
mind.  Ah yes... I can see clearly now.  There are voices carried in that
<br>
cool, cool breeze... &quot;Install Linux!&quot; &quot;No!  Solaris!&quot;  &quot;Write in Pearl!&quot;
<br>
&quot;No! Python!&quot;  &quot;No, write in Java!  It's easy!!&quot;  &quot;CORBA!&quot; &quot;Enterprise Java
<br>
Beans!&quot;  &quot;You will write only PL/SQL!&quot;  &quot;Eat bugs! The little yellow ones
<br>
with crunchy legs!&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes!  Yes!  Oh, rapture!!  Calgon!  Carry me away!!!!!
