<em>&gt; &gt; Well, the subtitle of the book is &quot;Ideological Origins of Political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Struggles.&quot;  This kind of gives the idea that it's about ideologies and
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; purely governmental stuff.:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, but then you read the blurbs and the book and see how much people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grind the governmental axe. Sowell makes the point early that even he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has unconstrained visionary tendencies. THen he tears into central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planners for the rest of the book. :)
</em><br>
<p>I think most people are mixed, in the same way that Chris Sciabarra (in
<br>
_Total Freedom: Toward a Dialectical Libertarianism_) believes most
<br>
dialectical thinkers have undialectical tendencies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Adopting a morality that is more this-worldly, such as that of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neoAristoteleans (e.g., Douglas Den Uyl, Eric Mack), neoStoics (e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lawrence Becker), and Objectivists (you know who:) would lead to no
</em><br>
conflict
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between morality and prudence -- or between being moral and living in
</em><br>
real
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From your lips to reality's ears. :)
</em><br>
<p>I did not say I would legislate such a view.  Each person would have to see
<br>
it for herself or himself and be convinced by her or his context.
<br>
<p>Even though these views are close to my own, I mention them just ot widen
<br>
the discussion.  If we stick with the typical view of morality as being
<br>
impractical, then Sowell's split between constrained and unconstrained
<br>
visions seems exhaustive _because_ it paints morality as being
<br>
impractical -- except when it's constrained.  (Note how liberals and
<br>
conservatives generally share a lot of the same moral views, yet the former
<br>
actually want to act on their morality while the latter want to be prudent.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another tough thing about Sowell's stuff is that one can always adopt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cynical view that expecting to change anyone's firm opinion is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of &quot;unconstrained vision&quot;. 'Round and 'round we go...
</em><br>
<p>I disagree, but I also think that it is not necessary to change everyone's
<br>
opionion to change society.  How many people were enlightened in the
<br>
Enlightenment?  Very few, yet those few made all the difference.  In a
<br>
sense, we still benefit from the changes that small minority wrought.
<br>
<p>I believe we must seek a dialectical resolution to the dualism Sowell,
<br>
Hayek, and others note.  This requires transcending the context of
<br>
conventional morality and politics.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
