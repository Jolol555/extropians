Spike, with all due respect, consider what your comments would sound
<br>
like if we didn't know you. Do you really think everyone in jail
<br>
deserves to be there? Are you aware of the current policy regarding
<br>
parole at Federal penitentiaries? Are you aware that one can easily rack
<br>
up 80+ year sentences with the current set of laws, for crimes with no
<br>
shown victims?
