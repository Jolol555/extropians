<em>&gt;From: &quot;Technotranscendence&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Question%20about%20PETA....&In-Reply-To=&lt;F94CTVuy16xsoIIzQtO0000b811@hotmail.com&gt;">neptune@mars.superlink.net</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;BTW, has anyone here read any of Peter Singer's works?  He's the big animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights philosopher.  I read his _How Are We To Live?_ several years ago and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;found it wanting.  He assumes a cleavage between being moral and being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happy -- doing what you ought to do as opposed to doing what you want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;His basic view of morality is as a collection of duties, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systematically grouped together they might be.  (I wrote to him on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subject before he came to Princeton, but got a form letter reply.:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have not read any of his works but I've read interviews with him and 
<br>
articles about him. Although he is big on animal rights, he thinks it's ok 
<br>
to euthanize deformed children. Is this an inconsistency, or is it correct 
<br>
to assume that he finds more value in a rat then in a month-old child?
<br>
(you can find a million different sites on this, here's one: 
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Agora/2900/psai.html">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Agora/2900/psai.html</a>&quot; )
<br>
A general inconsistency in the beliefs of animal-rights people is that if 
<br>
you ask them how they feel about abortion, the majority will be very 
<br>
pro-choice. I think a human fetus and a salmon are probably comparable in 
<br>
mental ability and think people should be allowed to kill either one for 
<br>
convenience.
<br>
Singer also believes that if you live above a certain income - 30K I think - 
<br>
without giving away the excess, you are morally responsible for the deaths 
<br>
of people in third world countries who you didn't give that money to. I read 
<br>
this a while ago and cannot find a link for it.
