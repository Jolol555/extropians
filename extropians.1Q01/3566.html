<p>Yes: which was exactly my point. Until Robert Peel's reforms, England
<br>
didn't have anything that today we'd recognize as a police system. A whole
<br>
load of reforms, happening around the same time, put the bite on crime --
<br>
introduction of municipal police forces, introduction of detection skills,
<br>
rationalisation of the penal code abolishing inappropriate draconian
<br>
penalties (so that people would be more willing to turn their neighbours
<br>
in for, e.g. pickpocketing), introduction of a real prison system ... and,
<br>
not to put too fine a point on it, a long-term sustained economic boom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, the murder/violence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate in England at the end of the 19th century was substantially lower than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is at the end of the 20th century.  Gun control laws did not go into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect until after the first World War, mostly due to fears of civil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrest.
</em><br>
<p>Misleading rot. The government in 1922 was *handing out* guns to combat
<br>
vets because they were afraid of a revolution. Licensing of firearms
<br>
at that time was used for political purposes, to prevent opponents of 
<br>
the state (read: communists) getting their hands on them. The current
<br>
system of handgun control came into force mostly after WW2 ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't want to get into a debate over this, but violent crime dropped 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sharply after the English started going out armed as a matter of habit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the first half of the 19th century in response to the high crime 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate.
</em><br>
<p>Bollocks to that. Violent crime dropped sharply with the introduction
<br>
of modern policing, the disarmament of the nobility, and the evolution
<br>
of a modern judicial and penal system.
<br>
<p>You've got a *very* weird view of English history. I don't want to get
<br>
dragged into a long thread on this, but if you want I have a friend who
<br>
has recently finished a PhD in the history of English policing during
<br>
the period in question -- I can put you in touch with him if you want.
<br>
<p>Clue: the arguments I'm putting are his, not mine. Lest this sounds 
<br>
like an appeal to authority, I'd like to point out that I do _not_ have
<br>
a PhD in the history of the development of the English police forces
<br>
from 1820-1850. However, Chris's discussion of that period sounds a hell
<br>
of a lot more plausible than yours (and he's happy to argue footnotes
<br>
and primary sources).
