<p>Well, I'm afraid I can't -- my copy of the book seems to be lent out.
<br>
I don't think he says they would &quot;blast&quot; newcomers; I think the image
<br>
was more along the lines of eating them.  Either consuming them for
<br>
resources or else co-opting or enslaving them.  At any rate, Moravec
<br>
suggests that the first humans to &quot;transcend&quot; (he doesn't
<br>
actually use that terminology) would be running the show, and that
<br>
latecomers wouldn't have much autonomy, unless they could manage to
<br>
escape into deep space.  Maybe this could be interpreted as meaning
<br>
simply that the more advanced Exes would &quot;employ&quot; the more recent
<br>
ones, but with the latecomers having no more real choice in the
<br>
matter than most wage-earners do in modern industrialized economies
<br>
(though no doubt the official description of the relationship could
<br>
be prettied up as much as needed to preserve the dignity of the
<br>
newcomers, if that was considered desirable).
