</em><br>
<p>You have just been bitten by the us-versus-them meme.  For some 
<br>
reason, most debates are assumed to have only two opposing sides. 
<br>
Guns are a great example.  Microsoft is another.  If you point out 
<br>
any tiny complaint about one side, you will suddenly find yourself 
<br>
pigeon-holed as a proponent for the other side.  You will be attacked 
<br>
for all sorts of assumed viewpoints expressed by &quot;your&quot; side.   This 
<br>
has happened to me so many times on this list that I sometimes 
<br>
question the usefulness of remote communications.
<br>
<p>It seems that it is too difficult to keep track of who believes what. 
<br>
It is easier to identify people into groups by one or two statements 
<br>
and then just argue against their group.  I don't know how to keep 
<br>
this from happening.  If you point out an error in pro-gun 
<br>
statistics, it must mean you're a gun-control nut.  If you point out 
<br>
an error in ant-global-warming statistics, it means you're a 
<br>
eco-terrorist.  If you mention a vegetarian diet for longevity, it 
<br>
means your a rabid animal-rights activist.
<br>
<p>I swear that for every valid disagreement I have had on this list, I 
<br>
have been attacked 10 more times for views that I never espoused.  I 
<br>
don't know how to prevent this.  As you will soon discover, in 
<br>
response to your question above, that your claims will fall on deaf 
<br>
ears.  People will try to justify their representation of &quot;your&quot; 
<br>
position and will even argue with you about what you &quot;really&quot; 
<br>
believe!  Like the Libertarian who will be accused of being a liberal 
<br>
by the right, and a conservative by the left, you will constantly be 
<br>
misunderstood.
<br>
<p>Let me know if anybody has any insights on this problem or knows a 
<br>
way out of it.
