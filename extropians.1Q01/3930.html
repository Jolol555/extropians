<em>&gt; No. I think you're generalizing American political correctness to the rest

</em><br>

<p>Considering that Britain has five times higher rate of property crime
<br>
than the US, I suppose that y'all are just totally automated and
<br>
inflexible about handing over your wallets to the average
<br>
thug-on-the-street.
<br>
<p>I like living in a polite high trust society more than an impolite low
<br>
trust society.
