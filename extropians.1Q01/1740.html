</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;no need to buy them back&quot;?  Do you realize how much money many people
<br>
have invested in firearms?  Considering that the a quarter of the
<br>
population owns guns in the US, and that most of them probably have guns
<br>
and accessories valued in excess of a thousand dollars, this would be an
<br>
extraordinarily vile policy and extremely unpopular.  You completely
<br>
disregard the consequences of such a stupid action.  Why would anyone
<br>
dispose of their weapons in a government approved fashion simply because it
<br>
was illegal?  Whenever the government passes legislation to make something
<br>
illegal to possess that is already in wide circulation, particularly in
<br>
cases where no compensation is offered, all that happens is that the vast
<br>
majority of owners either keep what they own but lower the profile, or
<br>
they sell it on the grey/black market, which is always buying.  The
<br>
economic motive is there and the result is that the government has even
<br>
less control than before.  
<br>
<p>And how would you like it if you bought a house and the government came in
<br>
and simply took it away, without so much as a penny's worth of
<br>
compensation, because someone else decided they should?  Fact is, most of
<br>
the people I know who own guns have at least $10,000 worth of gun stuff;
<br>
it is bad enough to confiscate the gear, it is even worse to do so in a
<br>
fashion that deprives a person of assets without even the semblence of due
<br>
process (which is almost certainly unconstitutional anyway).
<br>
<p>Of course, a total &quot;buyback&quot; in the U.S. would be an extraordinarily
<br>
expensive endeavor, considering the number of guns in circulation
<br>
(hundreds of millions); I'm not sure that people would be willing to pay
<br>
$100+ Billion in taxes to allow the government to buy/take everyone's
<br>
weapons.
<br>
<p>Legislating a total ban without compensation on something that most
<br>
everyone owns and that was expensive to purchase is a stupid and assinine
<br>
policy.  This isn't even about guns; it is flawed in principle applied to
<br>
any material item with a similar profile.
