<p><em>&gt;Yes, and I found it interesting to read over the weekend about

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefit from such research.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Religious opposition is certainly a problem, but when lives are at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stake or terrible suffering can be avoided, religions usually
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Christian opposition to anaesthesia for women in childbirth didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last all that long...
</em><br>
<p>Being an usual admirer of George Will's writing I was disappointed
<br>
to read this, but I'm going to guess he did this mostly on the
<br>
grounds of his religious convictions, and not because he is one of
<br>
those who would rather play the lottery than invest.
<br>
<p>However I should note that I don't see any particular advantage to
<br>
cloning humans. Working with the technology sure, but other than
<br>
that it would seem to be more an act of an overactive ego. I don't
<br>
see many of us as a successful enough phenotype to merit it.
<br>
<p>Deliberate cloning is low breed stuff, or to put it in an easily
<br>
spreadable meme:
<br>
<p>&quot;cloning is for livestock.&quot;
<br>
<p>Although I used to joke that once cloning came along we wouldn't
<br>
need POSTERS of our favorite starlets anymore... ;)
<br>
<p>Genetic enhancement and/or genetic correction are a vastly
<br>
different thing however, and I was very surprised to see George
<br>
lump them together. 
<br>
<p>Maybe he does have a touch of lotto fever....
