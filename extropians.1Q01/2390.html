<p>(I posted a list of dirty tricks by Microsoft.  People now perceive 
<br>
me as anti-Microsoft.  This post should balance things out.)
<br>
<p>My favorite MS program is Internet Explorer 5.5.  Although MS totally 
<br>
broke the syntax rules of HTML in previous versions, they have since 
<br>
seen the light.  Their latest version fixed much of their buggy 
<br>
non-compliant software, and added a lot of support for Cascading 
<br>
Style Sheets.  They released IE for the Mac later than the PC, and 
<br>
this latest version is currently rated as the most CSS-compliant 
<br>
browser ever.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Netscape has released a larger, bloated version which 
<br>
actually degrades its function.  Since being bought out by AOL, they 
<br>
have been more focused on merging AOL functionality into the browser 
<br>
rather than implementing actual Internet standards.  Microsoft IE is 
<br>
now a superior product over Netscape due to superior quality.
<br>
<p>My earlier post mentioned MS' dirty tricks of serving jagged fonts to 
<br>
Netscape, having MS servers delay netscape pages, and deliberately 
<br>
serving error messages instead of content to Netscape.  That was 
<br>
given as a history lesson.  None of Microsoft's current products are 
<br>
known to play these tricks any more.  Although many old-timers have a 
<br>
long memory, the market is quick and dynamic.  The market 
<br>
re-evaluates things currently in view.  Microsoft products are no 
<br>
longer defacto, and are actually fighting on their merits.  Macintosh 
<br>
is making a comeback.  Unix, especially AIX and Linux are becoming 
<br>
bigger all the time.  And Microsoft's defacto windows client base has 
<br>
fragmented into window 95/98, windows NT, windows 2000, windows ME, 
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Although Microsoft may have gotten its start with a lot of 
<br>
quasi-legal maneuvering and dirty tricks, these methods don't work 
<br>
forever. If Microsoft is going to survive, it will do so based on 
<br>
actual product quality.  Windows was a kludge of smoke and mirrors 
<br>
over DOS.  Windows 95 was actually a major product development of a 
<br>
shell over DOS.  Windows NT was actually a carefully designed 
<br>
operating system.  Windows 2000 is an attempt to migrate their client 
<br>
base from the kludge to the real OS.  In the future, they will have 
<br>
to produce even more quality products.  Their quick-and-dirty tricks 
<br>
seem to be a thing of the past.
