writes:&lt;&lt; What if, rather than relying on an employer or the government to 
<br>
meet their human needs, individual workers joined independent organizations 
<br>
whose primary purpose was to provide stable &quot;homes&quot; as they moved from job to 
<br>
job? We call these
<br>
organizations &quot;guilds&quot; by analogy to the craft associations of the Middle 
<br>
Ages, &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Chris,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could tease you a little by saying, &quot;we could call these organizations 
<br>
'extended families.'&quot;  However studies were done by socialogists I believe in 
<br>
the forties or fifties in Chicago of the really lower class families and how 
<br>
they operated.  Supposedly those families lives were so difficult and 
<br>
non-secure they stuck tightly together in a fairly extended family to 
<br>
survive.  It was said to be useless to threaten firing because they knew it 
<br>
would make no difference -- three meals a day were going to keep on coming in 
<br>
any case.
