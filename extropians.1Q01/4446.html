<p>Sorry to insist...
<br>
<p>&quot;Perhaps someone could produce an argument demonstrating that some of the 
<br>
critical standards necessarily used by a pancritical rationalist were not 
<br>
only unjustified but uncriticizable, that even the pancritical rationalist 
<br>
must accept something as uncriticizable if circular argument and infinite 
<br>
regress are to be avoided.&quot;
<br>
<p>If I say
<br>
1. All men are mortal.
<br>
2. John is a man.
<br>
3. Therefore John is mortal.
<br>
<p>what makes the third sentence true based on the previous two? You say it is 
<br>
logical, it is evident, but why is it so?
<br>
<p>If I, on the other hand, say that I can draw the conclusion:
<br>
<p>1.All men are mortal.
<br>
2.John is mortal.
<br>
3.Therefore John is a man.
<br>
<p>You will undoubtlessly say that I cannot do so, because the first premiss is 
<br>
an implication, and not an equivalence. Yet, when you say such a thing to 
<br>
someone not familiarized with the laws of logic (eg. a child), most will say 
<br>
that it is legitimate to draw 3 out of 2 and 1. How can you convince them of 
<br>
the contrary? You can explain that all that sentence 1 says is that A is 
<br>
contained in B, and so any element contained in A must belong in B, but the 
<br>
contrary is not true, because B can be &quot;larger&quot; than A. Still, I challenge 
<br>
the average person to reach this conclusion without any exterior help. It is 
<br>
not immediatly obvious that B can be &quot;larger&quot; than A, and therefore not be 
<br>
contained in it, or this wouldn't be a very common falacie among people that 
<br>
don't use logic that much. One has to come up with an example that doesn't 
<br>
fit in order to reach this conclusion. Well, then. Suppose we were all very 
<br>
dumb people, who lacked imagination and life experience to come up with that 
<br>
idea. If this was so, we would all hold this principle very dearly, as a 
<br>
self-evident thing, and include it as one of the cornerstones of our reason. 
<br>
Fortunately we don't.
<br>
<p>However, what about the prior principle? The one that says that
<br>
1. All men are mortal.
<br>
2. John is a man.
<br>
3. Therefore John is mortal.
<br>
<p>This also seems self-evident. You can say that the only reason why we still 
<br>
value this as true is that no one has been able to refute this yet. In our 
<br>
arrogance we believe that it is absolutely true and when confronted with the 
<br>
possibility that it might be false we say &quot;Hah! Show me something that 
<br>
proves it wrong!&quot; or even worse &quot;How can you doubt it? It is perfectly 
<br>
evident!&quot;(something that reminds me of the things &quot;fundamentalist&quot; people 
<br>
say sometimes when you question their beliefs), which is the same stance one 
<br>
could have had defending the falacie I mentioned before.
<br>
<p>The only reason we keep &quot;believing&quot; in it is because no one has been able to 
<br>
show us that it is wrong yet. This can either be because it is simply NOT 
<br>
wrong period, OR it could be just because this law is only 2 thousand years 
<br>
old and restricted to a very small &quot;testing area&quot; (Planet Earth and all 
<br>
phenomena happening in it), and so not enough testing has been done to 
<br>
present us with an event that contradicts it. In other words, we believe in 
<br>
it in very much the same way that we believe that the sun will rise again in 
<br>
the skies tomorrow. It always did, so why think the contrary? And yet, we 
<br>
know that this is by no means a proof that it always will.
<br>
<p>Our logic and reason are no less a religion than Christianism, since we are 
<br>
not even able to understand where our soft points are or why people like 
<br>
fundamentalist christians think the way they do, and we keep believing that 
<br>
reason is the only true answer to things.
