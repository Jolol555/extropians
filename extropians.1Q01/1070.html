<em>&gt; &gt; I suggest to you that the entire effort to create

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a human had no dependence on us, s/he would have
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This, again, is a non sequitur for AIs.  An AI has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allegiance to whatever
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>**Uh-huh--what if that doesn't include us?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; --will no more &quot;relate&quot; to us than we do to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, you must realize that the leap from material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ascendancy to social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ascendency is one that only makes sense if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunter-gatherer tribe.
</em><br>
<p>**I suggest that something which did not will be
<br>
incapable of relating.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or, perhaps more appropriately, to the descendants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those more primitive life-forms from which many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe we have evolved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you question this theory?
</em><br>
<p>**I refute it. Obviously portions of it are true--as
<br>
with the clear line from eohippus or whatever they're
<br>
calling it now (hyracotherium?) to modern horses,
<br>
early man to present man, etc. Portions of Newtonian
<br>
physics were true, or seemed to be, and it accounted
<br>
for observable reality. Nevewrtheless it was flawed.
<br>
<p>**To suggest that something like Man (&quot;in
<br>
apprehension, how like a god&quot;) is the result of
<br>
anything other than a conscious, directed, intelligent
<br>
effort is absurd. Same goes for any other complex life
<br>
form or biosphere. If memory serves, Darwin himself
<br>
conceded his theory had fatal flaws (the eye, for
<br>
example; too complex, too soon); they have not, as
<br>
yet, been corrected. And no, I'm not a creationist. I
<br>
see the matter as scientifically unresolved. I believe
<br>
anyone who can look at the earth and its
<br>
passengers--indeed, at the universe itself, right down
<br>
to the symmetry, and to the chaos that somehow comes
<br>
together--and ascribe it all to random chance...needs
<br>
to take another look.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Tell me--when you turn on the hot-water faucet, do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think about the bacteria in the drain being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scalded to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bacteria didn't write my source code!
</em><br>
<p>**True enough--but their ancestors did. And you feel
<br>
no obligation to refrain from killing them--much less
<br>
to look after them--because their ancestors wrote your
<br>
source code.
<br>
<p>This is my point.
