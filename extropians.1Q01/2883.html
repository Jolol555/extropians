<p><em>&gt; I think that if you gave everyone in India who is starving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;limitless&quot; supply of food, you'd see a population explosion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there of unimaginable proportions.  How far will even miraculous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology be able to be stretched before we once again have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people starving?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, precisely...
<br>
<p>I think we all dream of - or maybe at least feel highly of - a world like
<br>
Asimov described in Aurora: a whole planet divided into a relatively small
<br>
number of large properties, each of them governed by virtually
<br>
self-sustained hominids and their robots.
<br>
<p>Earth could be a place like that, but... with 6 billion people? I don't
<br>
know. Can the planet sustain 6 billion individuals with high energy/space
<br>
needs? If not - how do you get the population down to something more
<br>
acceptable - say 500 million? (An arbitrary figure, I just pulled it out of
<br>
thin air.)
<br>
<p>Of course, the obvious solution is to take a shotgun and some ammo and fire
<br>
away at will. But if we're doing this in the name of improved quality of
<br>
life, this is clearly not an option.
<br>
<p>An interesting idea might be to just leave the non-developed countries
<br>
alone; create a high-tech, self-sufficient society in one part of the world,
<br>
and leave the other poor suckers to be as they are. But these poor suckers
<br>
are a potential threat all along - they will develop weapons to threaten
<br>
with, they will develop industry that will pollute your environment, they
<br>
will cause local animal species to become extinct, and so on. So, you don't
<br>
want underdeveloped neighbors in your perfect world, because they spoil your
<br>
dream of a perfect world.
<br>
<p>How do you get around to dealing with them - preferrably in a humane and
<br>
non-intrusive manner?
<br>
