<em>&gt; &gt; He's perfectly right.  As technology advances, so does evil.  The thing

to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand about Bill Joy is that all the threats he refers to are more

<em>&gt; &gt; less real - it's just Bill Joy's unworkable &quot;remedies&quot; that indicate a

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I try to cultivate an MIB attitude.
</em><br>
<p>They're unworkable, but very persuasive. Don't for a moment think the fact
<br>
of
<br>
a remedie's being unworkable will pervent people from trying to implement
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately the rest of us have our work cut out for us by his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts.  He has been very effective at exploiting multiple media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities.  As his speech plays on people's fear he has the easier
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's hopes and dreams and do so widely and strongly I think he will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get far more people behind his ideas than we behind ours.
</em><br>
<p>You're right, except for one detail: forget hopes and dreams. Play on
<br>
people's
<br>
fears like they do-- observation shows that for whatever reason, this is the
<br>
more effective approach. Three words, folks: &quot;New Dark Ages&quot;.
<br>
<p>Three more words, folks: &quot;Fall of Civilization&quot;. Reversal of all the human
<br>
rights and quality of life gains that we've made in the last couple of
<br>
hundred years. Those who are against technology are thereby also against
<br>
lowered infant mortality, improved public health, more efficient
<br>
distribution
<br>
of resources (aka free, well informed, and low-friction markets), women's
<br>
liberation, racial/ethnic harmony, education, civil liberties, religious
<br>
tolerance, democracy, and anything else that's been worth the effort
<br>
humanity
<br>
has put into it.
<br>
<p>Want to protect your future? Oversimplify, overdramatize the issue and
<br>
hammer
<br>
it home over and over and over. Don't be ashamed to fight dirty as long as
<br>
you can look cleaner than the other guy. Luddites = Death
<br>
<p>Find the least charismatic of the lot and turn them into Hitler... ELF and
<br>
ALF will probably do as bad guys. Cultivate in the public's mind an image
<br>
of masked terrorists burning labs where medicine is being developed to cure
<br>
sick kids; it's only fair given the Frankenstein treatment scientists get
<br>
in the media. Bill Joy is probably not a good target, too media savvy. Ditto
<br>
Rifkin.
<br>
<p>It's not even intellectually dishonest-- it's just the abridged distilled
<br>
essence of a more complex and lengthy argument that would otherwise fail to
<br>
move the sound-byte weaned mob.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure even these extreme measures will work at this point-- we're
<br>
pretty far behind the game. While we've spent the last decade musing over
<br>
theories of memetics, these bastards have been busy with shall we say more
<br>
hands-on activities, and are possibly rivalled only by professional
<br>
advertising/PR agencies in their effectiveness by this point.
<br>
<p>The other alternative is to erode all centralized control structures using
<br>
technological means (crypto, digital cash, p2p networks, smart contracts)
<br>
thus kicking the main weapon of the Luddites out of their hands. The cure
<br>
might be as bad as the disease, though-- in principle I'm in favor of
<br>
anarchy, but in practice I've personally witnessed how basic research is
<br>
more deeply dependant on massive infusions of government grant money than
<br>
I've ever imagined possible. It may take some careful planning to disarm
<br>
the regulatory mechanisms without destroying the research funding ones.
<br>
<p>Why am I sending this gloom and doom? Well, perhaps because 'the masses'
<br>
aren't the only ones who need a crisis to get going. Perhaps our own
<br>
optimism
<br>
paralyzes us, and we won't speak up until we realize just how much of a
<br>
dangerous situation is developing for our species. Both responses have
<br>
drawbacks, but either is still safer than inaction, and other responses
<br>
may be found as we go along.
<br>
<p>But stash the &quot;hopes and dreams&quot; wishful thinking next to the flying cars
<br>
and the robot butlers. The struggle to survive inherently involves some
<br>
unavoidable negativism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Love, You Know Who
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...or at least you can probably guess who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the long-windedness. Life is taking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sudden career-conscious political turn,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and am trying to keep a lower profile.
