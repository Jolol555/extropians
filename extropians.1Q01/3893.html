<p><em>&gt;As a matter of clarification, my brother is one of thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voters who has filed an official complaint (I really don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the details) over being denied his right to vote. 
</em><br>
<p>Proper.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As for the ballots, unless you were there and have used them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself, you really have no rational basis for sniping at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;peoples' intelligence or ability to use them. 
</em><br>
<p>I was not there, but I recently saw firsthand the infamous Florida
<br>
ballot. It is practically the same as the ballot used here in
<br>
Illinois.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just because these under-handed activities led to Bush being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;installed as president is irrelevant to me. Had it been the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other way around I would feel exactly the same way. My problem is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the blatant disregard shown for the American people, and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our democratic rights (what little is left of them). It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing to do with who won. This is why I feel Bush is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;legitimately the president, not because I don't like the outcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It seems to me that anyone who actually believes in liberty should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a problem with this.
</em><br>
<p>I am unaware of any under-handed tactic that resulted in Bush
<br>
winning the presidency. I agree that it was a poor showing with
<br>
lots of room for improvement.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I say let's have a politics that is free of such narrow and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functionally empty dichotomies, one that actually reflects the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will of the people. Maybe this is naive, and maybe it's impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to achieve, but it seems like something worth working toward.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed.
