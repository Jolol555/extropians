<em>&gt;SIG and Ruger are two makers that I recommend new buyers look at. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;P94 and the entire P series is a great autoloader family from Ruger, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for 'first pistols' I'd recommend the GP101 revolver.
</em><br>
<p>i've never owned a gun before, though i've shot them.
<br>
as a young man, i have a certain fascination with guns(compressed power, 
<br>
basically) but i'm also a little leery of them.
<br>
<p>but it seems that some on this list see self defense as impractical without 
<br>
one(i originally continued studying martial arts for similar reasons..) so 
<br>
it seems i must be interested in defending myself. and i'm wondering what 
<br>
people in this thread think of whether someone like me ought to get 
<br>
aquainted with firearms, and/or purchase one. any suggestions would be 
<br>
welcome, with an addendum to my personality that i would rather save up and 
<br>
buy a nice solid item, than start with a &quot;newbie&quot; item and have to ugrade 
<br>
later. i'm thinking that would hold true for firearms as well, but don't 
<br>
know enough about them to make an informed decision.
