<p><p><em>&gt; I think it's important when employing this kind of reasoning to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there was GREAT diversity in the quality of life of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-agricultural people
</em><br>
<p>I agree with everything you said, Greg, but I don't see what bearing it has
<br>
on what I said. Although there must have been variations in group size,
<br>
social structure, and so forth--it's highly likely that all the groups were
<br>
small relative to populations of agricultural/urban societies; and it's also
<br>
highly likely that--at least to the extent they were able to--group members
<br>
took care of other members. I wouldn't think anyone knows for sure, but
<br>
based on the evidence that's available, most people would have lived in
<br>
groups based on some form of kinship and would have expected other members
<br>
of the group to share at least some of their food and water--you'd expect
<br>
the amount of help to vary depending on resources.  People living through
<br>
rough times in an inhospitable place might have a rule that a sick or weak
<br>
person should voluntarily seek death. But *most* peoople probably expected
<br>
help in times of need.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; This seems right - face-to-face social support by people one knows well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely has a different &quot;moral texture&quot; from a bureaucratically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administered social welfare system.
</em><br>
<p><p>Going back to the &quot;human nature&quot; idea--if it turned out that the greatest
<br>
advances in technology, literature, abstract mathematics, and so forth could
<br>
take place if there were a guaranteed life-sustaining income, would most
<br>
people want it? If so, how much would they want it?  Would it be possible
<br>
for a small group of very rich people to fund such a thing voluntarily? If
<br>
they did so, would they be willing to do it with no strings attached?
<br>
<p>Recent posts to this list lead me to believe that most people would not.
<br>
They would ask that the recipients alter their behavior in exchange for
<br>
recieving the guaranteed income. It's difficult to imagine a case where some
<br>
forms of behavior modification would not be sought, regarless of who was
<br>
administering a guaranteed income program.
<br>
<p>Greg says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... the &quot;true abundance&quot; idea we're discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here has the potential to be &quot;something completely different&quot; in Monty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pythonesque terms.
</em><br>
<p>What would it take? Is there any way to say: &quot;okay, once there THIS much
<br>
wealth, everyone can have a guaranteed income&quot;?
