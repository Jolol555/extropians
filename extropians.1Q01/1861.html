If you can ask another intelligent being
<br>
≥what is salt like for you?≤ and have it
<br>
reply in a way that you know it is not lying
<br>
and that its representation of salt is the same
<br>
(or not the same) as yours, you will have effed
<br>
and will really know that that being is conscious
<br>
much like you are, at least as far as what both
<br>
of your conscious representation of sodium chloride
<br>
are like.  
<br>
Traditional abstract science must undergo a kind
<br>
of paradigm shift, considering more than the abstract
<br>
cause and effect, before it can deal with the nature
<br>
of these subjective phenomenal qualities.
<br>
It must also be looking for the very real phenomenal
<br>
and emotional qualities of whatever is going on in our
<br>
mind to give us such sensations. These sensations are
<br>
much more than simple cause and effect.
<br>
This theory predicts that there really are phenomenal
<br>
colors, smells, sounds, warmthä or pain, itπs just
<br>
that none of these are beyond our senses,
<br>
and not qualities of what our senses are observing,
<br>
as most people seem to believe.
<br>
(B. Allsop in:  <a href="http://www.frii.com/~allsop/qualia.htm">http://www.frii.com/~allsop/qualia.htm</a> )
<br>
<p><p>Long time ago Cicero wrote the same story.
<br>
Cicero pointed out that there are things
<br>
(&quot;qualia sunt .....&quot;) which our senses feel
<br>
directly, and things (&quot;talia .....&quot;) which
<br>
are beyond our senses or our senses feel
<br>
*indirectly*, such as &quot;that is white&quot;,
<br>
&quot;this is sweet&quot;, &quot;that is sonorous&quot;,
<br>
&quot;this is fragrant&quot;, &quot;this is bitter&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Atqui qualia sunt haec,
<br>
quae sensibus percipi dicimus,
<br>
talia secuntur ea, 
<br>
quae non sensibus ipsis percipi dicuntur,
<br>
sed quodam modo sensibus,
<br>
ut haec: 'illud est album,
<br>
hoc dulce, canorum illud,
<br>
hoc bene olens, hoc asperum'.
<br>
-Cicero (Academicorum Priorum, Liber Secundus)
<br>
<p>scerir
<br>
<p>Qualia from Hilbert space?
<br>
-Can we feel the Hilbert space?
<br>
-Yes, Virginia, we can feel the Hilbert space.
<br>
&nbsp;It's called intuition.
<br>
Let me try to explain........................
