<p>[I just quoted the final paragraph in your message, although the rest of
<br>
your message also delivers a good point.]
<br>
<p>Your rationale is quite convincing. I would tend to agree with you, with
<br>
little restraints, on the arguments you delivered.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, there is still the argument of people dying and of
<br>
society being a slightly more dangerous and definitely less friendly place
<br>
because of a widespread attitude like yours. I've talked with several
<br>
Americans who have been to Europe, and I've talked with several Europeans
<br>
who have been to America, and we basically agree on the same thing: the
<br>
living environment in the US of A is definitely not friendly. It's a country
<br>
much more rough than we have here, and everything I've seen, read and heard
<br>
agrees with that. I would guess that attitudes like yours help significantly
<br>
in reinforcing the non-friendliness and coldness of your society. I would
<br>
like to make a strong point of this: I definitely think that a widespread
<br>
presence of individualist, society-fearing attitudes continuously reinforces
<br>
a society that is indeed to be feared.
<br>
<p>In the end, it all comes to a tradeoff: quality of living (of which I am
<br>
quite convinced you have less than we do) versus the ability to defend
<br>
oneself. As appealing as your arguments may be, I still think the ability of
<br>
defending oneself with firearms is not as important as you may think.
<br>
Despite of our much-alluded-to history lessons, we decided to opt for the
<br>
quality of living instead. You, on the other hand, continuously decide for
<br>
the ability to defend yourself. That's fine with me, but I don't think it's
<br>
a smart choice.
<br>
<p>At the bottom line, you're a bunch of scared people. You seem to think that
<br>
conflicts matter; I think they don't. You seem to think that who wins
<br>
matters; I don't. And most of all, you probably don't see how this attitude
<br>
of yours reinforces a cold, adversary society.
<br>
<p>I think your attitude is the original reason why you have a police you need
<br>
to be afraid of; not the reverse.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; And if in the end we still disagree then come around yourself
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and try to take my guns away.  Don't send some poor underpaid
</em><br>
<em> &gt; flatfoot to do it for you.
</em><br>
<p>I apologize if this is what my original message looked like. Under no
<br>
circumstances would I try to push a ban on anything where a non-trivial
<br>
number of people disagrees with it. It's a decision a society has to make
<br>
with a vast majority of votes, and I don't see you making that decision
<br>
anytime soon.
<br>
<p>Which is fine with me.
