<p>No. I think you're generalizing American political correctness to the rest
<br>
of the world.  Seriously, you guys are so up-tight about trivia -- like
<br>
assholes who cop an unwanted feel, or six-year-old's who point their fingers
<br>
at a teacher and say &quot;bang&quot; in school -- that I fear you've lost all sense
<br>
of proportion. There is a *qualitative* difference between minor offenses
<br>
-- such as a pie in the face, or an anonymous grope on a crowded train --
<br>
and major ones -- like armed robbery or rape. Whatever happened to the ability 
<br>
of the law to turn a blind eye to minor insults?  Is your society so 
<br>
automated and inflexible that you can't see this?
