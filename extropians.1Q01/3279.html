<p>I thought it was funny when the guy threw a cream pie at Bill Gates, but
<br>
it was a minor crime.  Gates could sue the guy and win for hundreds of
<br>
thousand of dollars, whereas that guy couldn't sue back by himself.
<br>
Gates could probably have the guy dealt with in a more severe manner.
