<em>&gt; At 12:58 AM 21/02/01 -0800, Max reposted a Feb 1999 speech by Charlton

<em>&gt; Heston, which said toward the end:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;When Time  magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deranged, crazy Christians  holding a cross  as it did last month ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;boycott their magazine and the  products it advertises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Presumably he means this one, Jan 18, 1999:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,1101990118,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,1101990118,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but what was John Galt complaining about in this odd imperative? Was he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply offended to the point of boycott because `millennium nuts' were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being unfairly portrayed as Christians? Was he miffed because deranged,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crazy Christians were being unfairly pilloried as `millennium nuts'? This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a nuance that only an American could unpack, I suspect. Could someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please make it clear to this poor boy holding up two crossed Vegemite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sandwiches?
</em><br>
<p>The 'millenium nuts' were primarily focused on the Y2K bug, which
<br>
clearly has no holy or unholy origin, and the fact that the true
<br>
religious millenium was Jan 1, 2001, NOT Jan 1, 2000, illustrates the
<br>
incongruence, beyond the fact that if Jesus were supposed to come again,
<br>
he'd be re-born at this time, which is NOT the true end of things (he
<br>
has to grow up to be in his mid 30's first) under christian chiliastic
<br>
dogma. In fact, the projections of the Singularity occuring in the 2030
<br>
range jives more with standard chiliastic dogma than the Y2K bug does.
<br>
<p>What Heston was objecting to was Time's depiction of one family that was
<br>
preparing for the worst and emphasising the fact of them being devout
<br>
christians as if this explains why they were acting so nutty. Fact was
<br>
that a lot of people prepared for the worst for a variety of reasons,
<br>
and the general attitude among people in the rural areas WAS pretty much
<br>
hope that the big city world would self destruct in its own
<br>
unwieldiness.
<br>
<p>Frankly Time is a rather pathetic magazine. To this day they refuse to
<br>
acknowledge that they were a tool of North Vietnamese propaganda warfare
<br>
because their Saigon bureau chief during the war has since turned out to
<br>
be a decorated Major General in the Vietnamese intelligence service.
<br>
Most of the stories he filtered through were picked and rewritten
<br>
specifically to benefit the NVA cause.
