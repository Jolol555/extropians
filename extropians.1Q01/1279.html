From: &quot;Gina Miller&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:nanogirl@halcyon.com?Subject=Re:%20existanZ&In-Reply-To=&lt;005901c07ed6$48c75ce0$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">nanogirl@halcyon.com</a>&gt;

<p><p><em>&gt; Did anyone else see existanz?
</em><br>
<p>Saw it.
<br>
<p>Love Cronenberg's imagination; he wisely surrounds himself with strong
<br>
filmmaking talent, and I am very interested in the subject material.  I
<br>
enjoyed this movie.
<br>
<p>But.
<br>
<p>David likes to use his material to provoke.  I appreciate that.  I think,
<br>
however, that he has inadvertantly (or not?) placed this movie into a fuzzy
<br>
'non-commital' zone between commercial accessibility and artistic efficacy.
<br>
Hey, that's a smart zone to shoot for, very ambitious actually, but it's a
<br>
place from which it is very hard to make really good movies.
<br>
<p>This movie represented (yet) another instance in which I had the sensation
<br>
that the director could have afforded to be a little bit closer to his
<br>
material.  I actually have a lot of respect for Mr. Cronnenberg's process--
<br>
he is a meticulous director-- but as a devotee of the immersive storytelling
<br>
concept (perhaps I'm *too* close to the material...) I felt his treatment
<br>
lacked... intimacy.
<br>
<p>I'm a little bit hard on this movie-- I anticipated it for many reasons, and
<br>
it actually is very well constructed.  But, to be frank, I don't feel that
<br>
David Cronenberg successfully invented VR in this film.  His construct was,
<br>
well, sort of prosaic actually.  I would have appreciated a greater (or
<br>
lesser!) injection of eerie non sequitur, and more intelligence behind the
<br>
game plot.
<br>
<p>I -do- recommend it however.  The acting is very very good.  There is
<br>
significant intelligence represented here.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>I think it would be cool if this topic ellicts a constructive conversation
<br>
regarding VR-- I certainly have a lot to say on the subject!  :)
