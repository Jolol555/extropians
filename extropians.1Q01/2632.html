<p><em>&gt;The California utilities had their power cut off because they failed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to pay their last bill.  Utilities in other states who can still pay 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for power are still getting it.  When President Bush ordered the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other states to not cut off power, the power came back on.  There is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no lack of power.  There is a lack of solvent utility companies. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is no question about how to get the power back on.  The only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question is who is going to pay for it.
</em><br>
<p>That's not entirely true.  There is not enough power being produced in the
<br>
US West, and especially not in California.  Typicallly it's enough,
<br>
but if something goes wrong it's not.  The problem is that supply
<br>
is inelastic beyond a certain price (short-term, since it takes a 
<br>
while to build plants) and demand is inelastic since the price 
<br>
consumers pay is set by fiat.  
<br>
<p>The sensible solution is simply to raise consumer rates until supply
<br>
and demand are matched.  A market would do this automatically;
<br>
the utility board could have done it if it were truly concerned with
<br>
stable electricity supply, economic growth, common good, etc.
<br>
Of course, it's a politically appointed board, so it has other ends.
<br>
I suspect they kept rates low to help their own reappointments and
<br>
the re-election of their friends.  Kind of a 12 billion dollar campaign
<br>
contribution extorted from the utilities, albeit spent *very*
<br>
inefficiently.  I'd also think it worth investigating the board members
<br>
for connections to electricity wholesalers, since they are the main
<br>
beneficiaries of this bizarre policy.
<br>
<p>Now that the state partially owns the utilities and will have to pay
<br>
for electricity, I expect the utility board will start acting sensibly
<br>
and keep consumer rates at a level that allows the wholesale
<br>
market to clear.  If not, we're in for a catastrophic summer out
<br>
here.
