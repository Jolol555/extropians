<p>Consider the following two hypothetical situations:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two eight-year old children are building a shopping mall with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legos on a Saturday afternoon. One is working on the entrance way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the other is working on two of the mall stores. As the model
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gets more elaborate, they see that they will soon run out of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blocks if they wish to build the mall according to their grand
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;design. They decide to change their strategy and build instead
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just the entrance way, but with doorways to the stores. They
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide they can later use some old shoe boxes for the stores. They
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tear apart the stores already built and begin building the mall's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entrance way collaboratively with renewed vigor. They even go and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get some small house plants and put them in the middle as &quot;trees.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continue working for the rest of the afternoon and into the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;early evening. The mother of one of the children calls to say it's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time to come home for dinner. A bit aggravated by this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interruption, the friend agrees to come back tomorrow to help
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finish the model.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multimedia design team is busy developing the company's latest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CD-ROM. The team's two graphic artists, Jean and Pat, have been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to learn a new 3-D graphics application for use on the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project. While both have been learning the tool separately on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their own, they decide to work together after lunch one day. Both
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soon discover that the other has learned some very different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things. Both decide to work on a clown figure that Jean began
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earlier in the week. As they try to learn all of the tricks of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;package, the clown figure starts to look ridiculous and both can't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help laughing at the &quot;monster&quot; they have created. However, they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fail to figure out how to access the animation features of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;software. Before they know it, it's almost 7:00 p.m. and they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide to call it a day. Later that night at home, Pat makes a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breakthrough on the package and e-mails Jean about it, describing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some key ideas they should discuss the next day. Although it's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;almost midnight, Pat's phone rings. It's Jean. The e-mail note had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just arrived and it turns out that Jean had been working on the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same problem at home as well. Both laugh and look forward to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeing what the other has discovered the next day.
<br>
<p>What do these two situations have in common? At first glance, very
<br>
little. The first deals with children entertaining themselves with a
<br>
favorite toy and the second with highly skilled professionals working
<br>
on an expensive project for work. However, one soon sees some
<br>
important similarities. Both stories show people engaged - engrossed -
<br>
in an activity. All are willing to commit great amounts of time and
<br>
energy. Indeed, all are unaware of the amount of time transpired, yet
<br>
none would rather be doing anything else. All go to extraordinary
<br>
lengths to get back to the activity. Despite the obvious intense
<br>
efforts, false starts, and frustrations, all seem to be greatly
<br>
enjoying themselves, as evidenced by the fact that no one is forcing
<br>
them to spend free time on the activities. The children's project
<br>
isn't intended to help them on upcoming tests at school, but it would
<br>
be a mistake to think they are not learning anything. Likewise the
<br>
graphic designers are not thinking about being &quot;tested&quot; on the
<br>
graphics package and while probably not willing to share the clown
<br>
graphic with their boss, they recognize that this &quot;fun experience&quot; is
<br>
essential to learning the 3-D graphics software they need to use on
<br>
the project. Both groups talk about their projects as work, yet not
<br>
the kind filled with drudgery and tedium, but the kind of work leading
<br>
to satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. Of course, there is
<br>
another word that describes the two group's efforts - play
