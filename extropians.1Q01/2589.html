<p>
This discussion got off to a bad start, and I can't see that there's been
<br>
any real communication. I'd like to try again, beginning with the things we
<br>
agree on. These seem to be: 1. we both love our children and want the best
<br>
for them. 2. we both believe that immunization is good. 3. we both believe
<br>
that early breast feeding is good. 4. we both believe in letting children
<br>
try out things and do things for themselves. 5. we both beieve it's
<br>
unpleasant to be around children who run around making noise and breaking
<br>
things. 6. we both believe it's important to respect children as intelligent
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>Aside from the weaning issue, where we differ seems to be in the amount of
<br>
force we think one can justifiably use when dealing with children. I say
<br>
&quot;seems to be&quot; because I'm really not sure. We may each be giving a different
<br>
meaning to the word &quot;discipline.&quot; I think we're both pigeon-holing the other
<br>
somewhat. I DO believe in using force in extraordinary situations or
<br>
emergencies. For example, I forced my child to get an injection of
<br>
antibiotics when she had a strep infection that seemed as though it could
<br>
get serious if not treated immeditely (she hates getting shots) and strongly
<br>
encouraged her (perhaps to the point of using threats of force) to get her
<br>
immunizations.
<br>
<p>Generally, I believe in extending the libertarian principle of not
<br>
initiating force against another person to children as well as to adults. I
<br>
think this is where we probably differ, and I realize that my views are
<br>
radically different from the generally accepted views of our culture. I HAVE
<br>
had very good results with a number of different children, including a
<br>
foster child who was considered a hopeless case; and other people who have
<br>
used this philosophy have also had good results. So I cannot honestly say I
<br>
think you're right in believing that non-coercive methods of child rearing
<br>
never work.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  How does learning things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you need to learn preclude learning to think for yourself?
</em><br>
<p>When you put it that way, it doesn't. But this is not exactly what I was
<br>
saying. I believe it was Denis Bider who commented that a person learns
<br>
better when he's interested in the subject matter and has a personal reason
<br>
for learning the material. A person who crams for an exam in botany usually
<br>
doesn't retain the information for very long beyond the day of the exam. But
<br>
a person who learns botany because he wants to be a more successful gardener
<br>
will remember what he learns. A child who's forced to learn to read when he
<br>
has no use for the skill will not learn it very well. This is probably the
<br>
main reason that children from homes without books usually do more poorly in
<br>
school. It's not that there's something wrong with their brains--it's that
<br>
they have no use for learning to read. If you show them some of the cool
<br>
things they can find out from books, they'll quickly learn to read. I'm
<br>
saying this from personal experience as well as similar experiences of other
<br>
people who've been involved in helping children learn.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; No, usually, it's about letting her work past day-to-day difficulties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herself, rather than assisting her.  Naturally, there's a balance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be struck:  we don't want her to become overly frustrated with tasks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are just too advanced, but we also don't want her to rely upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us to do tasks that are within her ability.
</em><br>
<p>We seem to be in complete agreement here. I never would have thought of this
<br>
as discipline, so part of our problem in communicating has to do with
<br>
different meanings we're giving to words.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You seem like a nice person, Barbara, but I just don't understand why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you continue to malign my motivations.
</em><br>
<p>Well, okay. But malign seems like a pretty strong word. All I said was that
<br>
surely bedtime training was for your convenience rather than for the benefit
<br>
of the child. I didn't say it was bad to sometimes do things for your own
<br>
convenience. I was motivated by my own convenience much of the time. Who
<br>
isn't? One of the reasons I chose not to do bedtime training for my child is
<br>
that I'm a night person and it didn't bother me if she stayed up late
<br>
(didn't bother her either. She was never sick until she was 6 years old and
<br>
got the strep infection).
<br>
<p>In fact, when my child was little, I used to be the first to admit that I
<br>
was a terrible mother. I was constantly taking the easy way out. One of my
<br>
reasons for not weaning to a bottle was that I didn't want to be bothered
<br>
opening cans and washing bottles, and besides, nursing was an easy way to
<br>
take off the weight I'd gained while pregnant. What's so cool to me about
<br>
the whole experience is that the easy way turned out to be the best way
<br>
(okay, it may not be the best way in every case--but it very often is the
<br>
best way). I know it would be more tactful to say, well, this is my way and
<br>
other people have other ways that work for them and who am I to say? But in
<br>
this case, I believe there's enough objective evidence to say that the easy
<br>
way really IS often the best way. It's the same as with
<br>
agriculture/horticulture. People make it a lot harder than it has to be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bedtime training is mostly for her benefit.
</em><br>
<p>How is it for her benefit? I truly don't see this, unless she has to get up
<br>
in the morning at a certain time and can't take naps during the day.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Discipline isn't just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool for parents to maintain order.  It's a gift that you give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child that she can use her whole life to help her to reach her goals.
</em><br>
<p>I can see this. But again, I've found that children learn best by simply
<br>
following examples. My mother once commented to me that she was glad I'd
<br>
trained my daughter in good table manners. I was surprised to hear this,
<br>
because I'd never even brought up the subject of table manners with my
<br>
daughter. In fact, I can recall laughing along with her when she was little
<br>
and smeared food on her hands and face. But apprently what had happened was
<br>
that she watched what I did and copied it. It was that simple. Same with
<br>
toilet training. I don't believe a word was ever said about it; she just
<br>
watched and copied. And the same pattern seems to be continuing now that
<br>
she's almost grown. Occassionally I try to impart &quot;gems of wisdom&quot; but the
<br>
most potent teacher always seems to be example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can't you even begin to assume that my motivations are noble and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions I take or don't take are for her benefit above all?
</em><br>
<p>I apologize for this. In fact, you probably take parenthood more seriously
<br>
than I did. I don't mean that I didn't and don't love my child, but I tried
<br>
to make motherhood fun above all (which is pretty much my approach to life
<br>
in general). What I'm trying to get across is that sometimes the fun, easy
<br>
way is the best way for all concerned. People make life harder than it has
<br>
to be. I should probably add that I've been a single mother since my child
<br>
was 5 years old, and most of the time I've had very little money. I chose
<br>
the option of working only part time and scraping by on almost no money by
<br>
buliding my own house, growing food in the garden, raising chickens and so
<br>
forth. As it turned out, this was probably the best thing I could've done
<br>
for my child, but my motives were largely personal. It was more fun to do it
<br>
that way than trying to balance raising a child with working full time at a
<br>
job. I think this is probably a very feminine way of doing things, whereas
<br>
the discipline method is a more masculine approach.
<br>
<p>In fairness to me, I'd like to point out that you began our exchange with
<br>
some rather untactful comments aimed at my child rearing methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; The kid has an absolute panic attack if she isn't there when he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wakes up from a nap.
</em><br>
<p>Children go through different stages as they grow, and of course everyone
<br>
has a unique personality. Maybe meeting the child's needs at this stage in
<br>
his development will give him the self-assurance to be more independent
<br>
later on. When I said early nurturing results in more independent older
<br>
children, I had in mind children of 10 or older rather than toddlers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who's talking about their being out on their own?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry. I was resorting to sarcasm which, my 9th grade English teacher told
<br>
me, is the refuge of the small minded. Or something like that.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;I'm talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not seeing mommy in the room and panicking.
</em><br>
<p>Can you see that you're being quite judgemental in this case, perhaps
<br>
unfairly so? Each child has a unique personality (my farming experience has
<br>
taught me that this is true of non-human animals as well--genetics plays a
<br>
huge part in determining what we are). It clearly irritated you when I said
<br>
you were mistaken. And yet--although you didn't explicitly state it--you
<br>
certainly implied that I am mistaken and that your friend is mistaken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, but you were talking about lack of &quot;coercion&quot; leading to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-confidence and independence.  I'm just pointing out that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience is that your philosophy leads to the opposite, a lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independence and a lack of self-confidence.
</em><br>
<p>There are many factors you're not taking into account here. First, of
<br>
course, this is only one case. This particular child may have unusually high
<br>
needs for security at this stage in his life. Second, a 3 1/2 year old is
<br>
still a very young child. And I believe you said he's a boy. Boys seem to
<br>
lag somewhat behind girls in early development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;When I was an employee at a company, and my boss said, &quot;We need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;implement this totally different X with this new technology Y.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;You bet your sweet bippy that I did some forced learning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;thinking. That's the way life normally works, and to shield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;children from being &gt;trained in methods of coping with that is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;tremendous disservice to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Good training for followers of orders, to be sure. But how about for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;creative, independent thinkers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does being able to follow orders preclude being creative and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent?
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't. And it seems clear from everything you've said that you're
<br>
encouraging your child to think for herself. But your earlier comment about
<br>
&quot;the way life normally works&quot; implied that one's usual lot in life is to
<br>
follow orders. I was pigeon-holing you as a result of that comment. I was
<br>
reminded of the following kind of exchange between parent and child:
<br>
<p>Mother: Clean up your room.
<br>
Kid: But Mom, I'm right in the middle of building a space station.
<br>
Mother: I said clean up your room. Now.
<br>
Kid: Why?
<br>
Mother: Because I said so, and if you don't do as I say, you're going to
<br>
lose your computer privileges.
<br>
<p>I think the kid had a legitimate question when he asked &quot;Why?&quot; and the
<br>
mother didn't give him a fair answer.
