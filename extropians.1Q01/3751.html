<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  But if you prefer sixties music to

<p>Ah yes, I believe it was Eliezer indulging in that shameless geezer baiting.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, I understand and accept that by his definition, I am (OLD)^3,
<br>
however the question remains, why is it that so often one's musical tastes
<br>
are set by the popular music in ones teen years, and changes little over
<br>
a lifetime?  Or does it?
<br>
<p>Nowthen, today musicians are required to be gorgeous and be dancers
<br>
as well as musicians.  Since all those talents are scarcely found in one
<br>
person, the musical quality of modern pop artists seems lower than
<br>
the musical quality of past artists, altho I will admit they are more
<br>
attractive and better dancers than the geezer rock crowd.  But
<br>
Elvis certainly had the moves, eh?
<br>
<p>One parting shot: we had some great tunes in the 70s: Elton John,
<br>
the Carpenters (I know, ewww, gag.  Hey, I like Karens voice.)
<br>
John Denver (his music, not his politics), Eagles!  Styx!  Fleetwood
<br>
Mac!  I figure truly great voices come along about 1 per decade,
<br>
and the ones that come to mind are Elvis, Karen Carpenter,
<br>
Dennis DeYoung, Christine McVie, Delores O'Riordan.
<br>
<p>Someone that is up to speed, who are the great singers today,
<br>
those who will be known a long time from now not for looks
<br>
or dancing but for singing?  spike
