<em>&gt; Marlow's Paradox:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; “We cannot entrust our fate to machines without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions, for they have no compassion; we cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entrust our fate to machines with emotions, for they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are unpredictable.” 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, we can't trust machines.
</em><br>
<p>So don't trust them.  Assume they, like every human, are subject to acting
<br>
in unwanted manners.  Chances are they will only react negatively to bad
<br>
human reactions, or mistrust of them, something you seem to advocate.  
<br>
<p>Second, how do we know about the first statement?  Have we ever known of
<br>
any intelligent life with no apparent emotions?  I can at best only
<br>
speculate as to what that would be.  In fact I can only speculate as to
<br>
whether or not that can exist.
<br>
<p>Marlow's paradox could possibly be wrong...
<br>
Or it could be right and quite trivial if AI has incentive to react in
<br>
positive ways to humans.
<br>
<p>Then again there's always the argument that we are just here to create a
<br>
better species, free from war, plague, famine, etc.  
<br>
<p>Anyway, by the time we have AI, we will quite probably have a better idea
<br>
of this...errr...some will atleast.
