Hi all,
<br>
&nbsp;Delurked to say hello and toss something up in the air (and see who takes a
<br>
shot at it).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering how many of the single as-yet-childless
<br>
extrops/transhumanist types have deliberate plans for doing the &quot;family&quot;
<br>
thing w/o another set of genes involved.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Call it a &quot;Line&quot; (which is my working name..working for reasons I'll
<br>
mention later on). SF has loads of clone families scattered throughout the
<br>
lit.  What will we see first? what type of &quot;family&quot;? who has it on their &quot;if
<br>
cryonics, AND uploading AND extreme longevity tech ALL fail to
<br>
materialize....this is the sure-shot to &quot;immortality&quot; for me&quot; plan?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I say &quot;Line&quot; because the family name is in a language that hasn't been
<br>
invented yet.  I suspect it might take another 20 years to lay all the
<br>
groundwork for a Line, which is fine..makes the tech more reliable by that
<br>
time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A good Line might have a linguistic identity as well as a genetic one.
<br>
Having a singular founder would increase the opportunity to make dramatic
<br>
&quot;alterations&quot; in the childhood development envioronment.  I think
<br>
multi-lingual rearing environments would be a bare minimum, but also a
<br>
subtle constructed language, probably drawing from the most efficient
<br>
aspects (structurally not phonetically) of Mandarin, Anglais and Esperanto.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I already have a Line style of martial arts in mind...this would be a
<br>
&quot;family style&quot; much like the  hoarded family styles of east asia.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Line member might make suitable &quot;modifications&quot; to their
<br>
offspring...it's the base code that's the object of sentiment.  Cybernetic
<br>
enhancements similarly..it would be an infostructure
<br>
(genetic/linguistic/developmental) that bound the family together.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would they have a super-pronoun in their language a la Asimov
<br>
(I/We/Us/TheLine)?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone else who ponders this please give me some feedback..perhaps we
<br>
could toss around ideas.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd especially like some thoughts from the Extrops who play on the weird
<br>
side more often than me :)
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
brian
