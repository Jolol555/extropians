<em>&gt; It seems to me that people of the Jewish culture are less antagonistic

<p>Jewish society, with rare exceptions, is not at all technophobic. 
<br>
However, there were increasing signs of infection at the time that I left
<br>
physically (mentally, I'd left a long time ago), so get them while you
<br>
can.
<br>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd guess that it has something to do with (a) the fact
<br>
that rabbis derive religious authority from their technical expertise on
<br>
the amazingly complicated laws, and (b) the amazingly complicated laws
<br>
soak up all the religious fervor, leaving none for traditional Luddite
<br>
fundamentalism.  Though, when I left, there were signs of growing
<br>
infection; predator memes moving into the ecological void.
