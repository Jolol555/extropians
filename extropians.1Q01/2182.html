<p>The general rule is, you are not allowed to carry a weapon for purposes of
<br>
using it on someone (whether in defense or offense makes no difference).
<br>
<p>However, if you have a non-combative reason, you can carry most anything
<br>
that isn't banned outright. For example, live-action roleplay people or
<br>
Sealed Knot (civil war re-enactment) types get to carry axes, swords and
<br>
muskets in public. There _is_ a requirement that the items should not
<br>
be ready for use; if carried by hand, use a kit-bag, if in a vehicle,
<br>
put then in the boot (ObUS: trunk).
<br>
<p>The cops will take an extremely dim view of any kind of knife with a
<br>
blade more than three inches long unless you've got a good excuse (it's
<br>
a chef's knife and you're taking it home from the shops/on your way to
<br>
a friend's dinner party/etcetera), but penknives and leatherman-type
<br>
multitools are fine. They might raise an eyebrow at your 6 D-cell maglite
<br>
if you're carrying it around in the morning, but keeping one in your
<br>
car or carrying one at night is fine unless you give them reason to
<br>
believe that your main motive for carrying it is as a weapon instead of
<br>
a torch. And so on.
<br>
<p>Tasers and pepper spray are illegal (although in Scotland the Police use
<br>
pepper spray -- go figure). 
<br>
<p>It is an _extremely_ bad idea to carry a replica gun of any kind in
<br>
public, because someone will call the police and their tactical firearms
<br>
teams will assume that it is a real gun until proven otherwise. And
<br>
unlike the majority of armed cops, these guys are specialist marksmen
<br>
and will shoot to kill if they think there's a danger to the public.
