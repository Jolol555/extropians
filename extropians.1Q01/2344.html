<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt;Guns isn't a left vs right issue over here .... NOBODY is asking to
<br>
S&gt;have them become legal!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A quick check of your personal and &quot;multisell.co.uk&quot; domains
</em><br>
<p>Actually multisell.com and multi.co.uk ... but yes, UK Ltd., Leeds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;indicates you're in Leeds.  So, &quot;over here&quot; is the U.K., yes?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Given this, then, you are either egregiously misinformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or deliberately misrepresenting the debate as it exists in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;England.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I had the pleasure of meeting and making friends with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very politically active and publicly visible libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and pro gun rights activists during my 3 years in London,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;e.g. Chris Tame, Ian Geldard, David Botsford, Tom Burroughes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brian Micklethwait, and the incredibly prolific Dr. Sean Gabb.
</em><br>
<p>OK, so I was just including all the mainstream political parties,
<br>
including the Conservative right-wingers, but out of the 55 million
<br>
or so of us there are going to be a few extreme libertarians .. and you
<br>
seem to have found them! 
<br>
<p>These individuals (I have never heard of them) may be prolific, but
<br>
don't represent significant numbers I assure you. Don't be taken in
<br>
by their propaganda.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are you also not familiar with Guy Savage and the Shooters' Rights 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Association?  He's been on TV quite a bit too.
</em><br>
<p>Never heard of them. Do you have examples of a single M.P. or
<br>
person holding some actual political post who holds these views?
<br>
Sure you are going to get fringe pressure groups .. have you heard
<br>
of our Monster Raving Looney political party who put up a candidate
<br>
in every election here (and never get more than a few votes)?
<br>
<p>S&gt;And besides, I am above human-been politics left or right.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, sure, I believe you, Steve.
</em><br>
<p>Seriously, I think the old political theories and divisions are a
<br>
nonsense, and that the post-human aesthetic does away with
<br>
such distinctions. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;www.steve-nichols.com
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Enlightened Being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Does your enlightenment spare you the necessity of doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your homework?  You've made a blatantly untrue, easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contradicted assertion that all Englishmen share your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political views vis-a-vis victim disarmament.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, generalisations are meant for effect rather than to be
<br>
taken absolutely literally ... I have no time or inclination to
<br>
personally ask each of 55 million people whether they share
<br>
the general support of the gun ban .... any exceptions are a 
<br>
tiny minority however, so my general point stands. 
<br>
<p>I also realise that USA has a different culture, and gun ownership
<br>
is seen as some sort of religion or sacred freedom by some folks
<br>
there ...... and that a different accommodation may need to be made.
<br>
<p>But any comparison of figures of number of shootings per head of
<br>
population here and in the USA will stack up favourably to the UK.
