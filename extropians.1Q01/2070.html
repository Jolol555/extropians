Greg Burch forwards George Will's column:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Enhancement is not therapy, it is eugenics....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eugenics, any tailoring of an individual's genetic endowment, even when less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambitious than cloning, will put us on a slippery slope to the abolition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man.
</em><br>
<p>In a way, this language about &quot;the abolition of man&quot; may actually be a good
<br>
thing in the logn run.
<br>
<p>I don't believe George Will or any other conservatives are going
<br>
to succeed in persuading parents to have disease-ridden children.
<br>
Few parents will want to endure the heartbreak of watching their child
<br>
suffer.  And as other posters have pointed out, Will's attempt to draw
<br>
a line between &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive eugenics&quot; will never succeed.
<br>
The result is that we will see continued pressure to use technology
<br>
to cure preventable illnesses before babies are born.
<br>
<p>If Will and other conservatives are going to prattle on about this
<br>
represents &quot;the abolition of man&quot;, so much the better.  Anything which
<br>
forces people to stretch their minds and to think seriously about what
<br>
constitutes humanity is a good thing.  Once we can no longer cleanly
<br>
distinguish between Man, created by God, and the artifacts of Man's own
<br>
creation, we will have to look deeper, at the essence.  We will recognize
<br>
that the mode of creation is not important.  What matters is the being.
<br>
<p>This rethinking, which will undoubtedly be a long and difficult process
<br>
throughout the next several decades, will hopefully lead ultimately to
<br>
a world which can embrace new technologies in the same way that we do.
<br>
An intelligent machine, an uploaded man or woman, a genetically enhanced
<br>
person, or a traditional human, all will be seen as having equal rights
<br>
and deserving equal consideration.
<br>
<p>Reactions like Will's are going to occur at each step, of course.
<br>
But ultimately the benefits of taking the next step are so large that
<br>
it will happen.  As Will seems to recognize, we are indeed already on
<br>
a slippery slope.  He tries to draw the line between what is done today
<br>
and what will be done tomorrow.  Tomorrow we will have crossed that line,
<br>
and he will draw it again at the next boundary.  But the future beckons,
<br>
still.
<br>
<p>Hal
