<em>&gt; The lefty press cannot bring themselves to admit the real culprit:
</em><br>
greenie
<br>
<em>&gt; policies have led to voters demanding that no new plants are built.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is the crux of the matter, the core of the issue, the deciding
<br>
factor, and the fact that Mike Lorrey has expounded at length here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same voters wish for Sacramento to pass laws that power keep coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in at artificially low prices, with no additional air pollution, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlimited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply.  In response, our so-called governor gave a state of the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address in which he proposed making it a *crime* for power generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facilities to withhold power for economic reasons, and even went so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to propose legally seizing power plants.  Perhaps we should call this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place Kalifornia.
</em><br>
<p>Calling it Kalifornia seems appropriate, given the Marxist cockamamie
<br>
contradictions involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nowthen, those of you who live outside Taxifornia, prepare yourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a treat.  This will be a real hoot, trust me.  Public policy is
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; to make this current fiasco so much worse that a mere debacle will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very soon develop into a morass from which extrication is impossible.
</em><br>
<p>I can't wait.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Take for instance the electric car business.  The state *mandated*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that car dealers make 10% of their fleet &quot;zero emission.&quot;  (Hybrid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cars do not qualify.)  Now where is all that power to come from?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about all those electric cars?  Who pays for those?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxpayers?  Will they now be half the price of a comparable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gasoline car?  1/3?  If so, I want one.  Furthermore, since I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must pay anyway, I want the taxpayer to subsidize my power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill.
</em><br>
<p>Ah yes. You've delivered on your promise. This will provide a debacle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the way, if the Taxifornia taxpayer is essentially picking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up the bill for the power, what if I am off-grid?  Do I still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hafta pay my taxes?
</em><br>
<p>Not difficult to answer that. They may even decide to make taxes higher
<br>
for people who generate their own power. Rationale? They can afford it.
<br>

<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
