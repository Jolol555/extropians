<p>
The ' 90s turned the average buy-and-hold investors into avid IPO watchers,
<br>
seduced by the triple-digit gains (many new issues posted on their very
<br>
first day of trading).
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, one-fifth of shares that began public trading in the ' 90s
<br>
have
<br>
declined more than 90% from their _offering_ price, what big institutional
<br>
investors and Wall Street insiders paid before the company went public.
<br>
<p>Remember VA Linux Systems? It popped 698% on the first day shares
<br>
traded hands. Now shares go for 72% below the _offering_ price.
<br>
<p>But, luckily, the legalization of gambling in 48 states (including state
<br>
lotteries) and _until recently_ a vigorous economy contributed to the steady
<br>
growth of gaming casinos and the companies that make equipment for casinos.
<br>
Technological innovations, new products and, to a lesser extent, growth in
<br>
Asian markets are also stimulating this industry.
<br>
<p>While the gaming industry depends largely on consumers' disposable income,
<br>
game designers and manufacturers are well insulated from the effects of a
<br>
declining economy, according to David Barteld, a senior research analyst at
<br>
Wells Fargo Van Kasper. Barteld suggests that lower casino volumes would
<br>
help increase orders for newer, more profitable, one-armed bandits that coax
<br>
customers into wagering more for longer periods of time.
<br>
<p>The leader in game development and manufacturing is International Game
<br>
Technology (nyse: IGT), which has more than 70% market share in the U.S.,
<br>
according to Andrew Smith, a research consultant at the American Game
<br>
Association.
<br>
<p>A few years ago game manufacturers fell behind in efforts to retrofit new
<br>
technologies to existing casino infrastructure. Smith notes that the trend
<br>
toward video-based slot machines began only seven years ago and cashless
<br>
technology, only recently. IGT, in particular, according to Barteld, has
<br>
since boosted its research and development efforts and is once again at the
<br>
top of its game. IGT shares trade at 21 times estimated earnings of $2.51
<br>
for 2001.

<p><p>SPIKISM
<br>
The fall of ancient Rome has evoked many opinions as to the cause.
<br>
Some historians attribute at least some of the problem to an individual
<br>
named Spikus, a rabble-rouser who convinced Caesar to declare
<br>
November 8 as Spikus Worship Day.
