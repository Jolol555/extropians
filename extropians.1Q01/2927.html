</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is not that for me.  It is more practical of how we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; finance the escapade, how it will become self-supporting
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agree. But to start with, a significant increase in the public perception of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the importance of space exploration/colonization would be welcome. Followed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a significantly increased budget for organizations like NASA, giving them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more central role as a public project, rather than the obscure position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they currently hold. I think space exploration/colonization projects should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have at least the significance that they had during the 'space race' in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1960s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>A very sound argument can be made that giving NASA a more centralized
<br>
role is largely what got us into the current situation.  We need to set
<br>
private enterprise free and get rid of some disasterous policies such as
<br>
cost-plus bidding and putting all our boost eggs in one basket (which we
<br>
partially rescinded earlier in the 90s).  It will help to kick out those
<br>
aspects of the Space Treaty that make private enterprise in space
<br>
extremely problematic legally and that make it difficult to do anything
<br>
compliant with the ok of an international committee.  
<br>
<p>But, a bit BUT, it is not clear that manned presence in space is the
<br>
best idea for many of our immediate space goals.  It is probably much
<br>
more economically viable to expand space robotics to increase space,
<br>
lunar, and eventually Martian infrastructure to the point where real
<br>
wealth is being generated in sapce and an increased human presence is
<br>
both needed and better supported.  Sending humans for every or even most
<br>
steps is grossly wasteful.  It is one of the problems with having put
<br>
almost all our eggs into the Space Shuttle basket for so long. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regarding who would finance Mars colonization: well, there's 6 billion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us. Finance == work. I don't have sufficient global overview to claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're ready for colonization immediately, but I'm sure the world can afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than 1 human expedition per 10 years. I mean, there's 6 billion of us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we've got a whole planet of resources - and doing this is a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving our civilization! So, can we afford it? Yes, I think we can. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see resources as a problematic issue - the public perception of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance of such a project is the primary limiting factor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>A major colonization of Mars and the attendant terraforming is first of
<br>
all not a short-term project and second of all would take the entire GDP
<br>
of earth for many years if we did it on the scale you seem to wish. 
<br>
That is what I mean by lack of financing.  I think you greatly
<br>
understimate the cost using current means.  
<br>
<p>More than one expedition per 10 years is not going to make Mars a backup
<br>
for Earth anytime within the century.    Mars as a preserver for our
<br>
species in less time than that, without drastically  improved means, is
<br>
a pipe-dream. Do the math.
