<p><p>&lt;nit&gt;Actually, it is only three times higher than Scotland by recent

statistics.&lt;/nit&gt;
<br>
<p>For me it is a non-argument; crime levels aren't that far above the noise 
<br>
floor as far as I'm concerned.  The vast majority of people in the U.S. 
<br>
face a very low risk of murder (there isn't a whole lot of indiscriminate 
<br>
killing in the U.S.), and other forms of violent crime are considerably 
<br>
less prevalent than in most of Europe.  The murder rates of many European 
<br>
cities are the same or higher than the cities I live and work in, so I'm 
<br>
not sure what the big deal is.  If we are lucky, perhaps the U.S. murder 
<br>
rate will go down to what it was 40 years ago, when it was about the same 
<br>
as European levels.
<br>
<p>Given a fair and reasonable justice system, crime will take care of 
<br>
itself.  I think it is arguable that having too low a crime rate may be as 
<br>
much an indication of a pathological condition as having too high a crime 
<br>
rate.  If I had to put a number to it, I think a murder statistic of around 
<br>
1-1.5 would be acceptable for a healthy society.
