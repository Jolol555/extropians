<em>&gt; The question isn't whether a temperature change is 'natural' or not,

<em>&gt; &gt;From my perspective up here in Sweden global warming might be a good

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in Tchad and the Netherlands might not be as happy. An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting issue is how to manage a climate with many different

</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Terraforming_ it is likely technically feasible in the near future to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why, you burn, and they sequester. Now, if your burning and
<br>
externalization of wastes causes them damage, they rightly have a case
<br>
to pursue compensation. The fact is that there are proposals to seed the
<br>
oceans with iron to stimulate plankton blooms which seems to be the most
<br>
effective way to sequester the huge amounts of carbon that some claim we
<br>
need to get rid of. Such proposals are being ignored by global warming
<br>
proponents, so it seems to me that they really don't have an interest in
<br>
solving the problem. Why then would they seek to continue harping on it
<br>
without fixing it? Follow the money. What they want are huge
<br>
energy/carbon taxes levied, huge government bureaucracies to study the
<br>
problem and propose the international regulation of energy policies. You
<br>
have scientists, who normally struggle for grant and scholarship money,
<br>
who are proposing solutions that will give them nice secure civil
<br>
service jobs with big budgets and the authority to tell evil
<br>
corporations how to run their companies. This is all part of the
<br>
green/socialist agenda.
