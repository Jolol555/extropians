<p>Now that you've lumped me in with a bunch of people you claim to
<br>
despise, what am I to make of it? I don't want to sit idly by and see
<br>
misinformation promulgated, and I have some constructive suggestions to
<br>
add to a thread already in progress. That's not good enough for you?
<br>
Very well, sir. 
<br>
<p>Now I see something resembling extreme behavior, and I don't see it
<br>
coming from me. I am sure you get great satisfaction from your position
<br>
of moral righteousness as a champion of principle. As do all extremists.
<br>
Perhaps your extremism is situational. I hope so. I respect a great many
<br>
of the things you've reported having done in the interest of causes you
<br>
believed in.
<br>
<p>With great regret, then, I have nothing further to say to you. *PLONK*
