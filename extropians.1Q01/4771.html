From: Harvey Newstrom &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Air,%20Fire,%20Earth,%20and%20Water&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110701b6c17c9cc69a@[213.23.4.89]&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm don't think our brains have a preference for these four elements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Ayurveda  system has three elements.  The Chinese had five
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elements.  The Greek had four and later five elements.  Some American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indian systems had six elements.  There does not seem to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universal tie with the four elements that you list.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, perhaps a bit 'out there' .... (please remember that I'm from
<br>
wacky California)
<br>
<p>I admit that it's easily possible that my head was performing a
<br>
snazzy filter: once I saw &quot;Air, Fire, Earth, and Water&quot; in
<br>
a few New-Agey areas, then I began to 'see' it everywhere.
<br>
<p>If you are curious though, put those words through a few Web search
<br>
engines, and see the volume of things that comes out. Areas from astrology
<br>
to Greek history to music and poetry to magick to ... I did that after
<br>
I found these references in some of my books at home. Then I came to what
<br>
I thought was a plausible explanation regarding how the mind
<br>
categorizes some kinds of topics and Metaphors in Lakoff's book
<br>
( _Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things_)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;These four classification of everything in the universe down to four
</em><br>
<em>&gt;types of matter seems to be more reality-based than psychology-based.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but remember what Lakoff said: that some kinds of categorization
<br>
has a physical basis that all humans can recognize
<br>
( &quot;The image-schematic structure of bodily experience is, we hypothesize,
<br>
the same for all human beings.&quot;)
<br>
so it might be a natural and intuitive way to perceive our world.
<br>
<p>Thank you also for your really nice description, in those
<br>
two paragraphs, of the Golden Dawn, and your conclusion:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Instead of seeing all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of these ancient systems as confirming a single coherent system, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see our modern understanding of all these systems as being derived
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from a single primary source of consolidation, e.g. the Golden Dawn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Although these different systems seem to be independent-minded, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all derive from a consistent &quot;canonization&quot; of standard doctrines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much as the Catholic Church standardized their dogmatic beliefs into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a consistent whole.
</em><br>
<p>I had never heard of the Golden Dawn before. What you wrote makes
<br>
sense to me.
<br>
<p>Now shifting the topic to what I wrote at the end of my original msg:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And the religious practices in these systems focus on the individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being 'complete' by building from the 'inside', and not depending on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outside agents.
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if we can encourage folks _not_ to seek authorities
<br>
outside of themselves for when they have those times that they
<br>
want comfort from &quot;God/Allah/etc&quot; ? Even though the systems that
<br>
I listed are mystical, there are elements of value one can extract
<br>
from them, to help build inner worlds. For example, what I found
<br>
appealing about the Ayurveda system, is that it gives guidelines for
<br>
balancing one's life- I tend to be in my head all of the time, and
<br>
sometimes it's  hard to recognize that I have to give it a rest
<br>
and go for a walk or play music or do something to exercise the other
<br>
parts of my very human life.
<br>
<p>Samantha has written here a number of times that we all (or many people)
<br>
have a yearnings for a deeper, richer comforting inner world (I'm paraphrasing
<br>
her _alot_, it may not be right), and this is where religion fills that
<br>
need for many people.
<br>
<p>Two doors down from me is a church. There are many around, so nothing
<br>
special about this particular church. The church bells ring every hour,
<br>
on the hour, for 24 hours a day. Religion in this country plays a much
<br>
more prominent role than the cultures that I grew up in. For many
<br>
people here it's a source of comfort, and they honestly like it.
<br>
<p>Occassionally, or more than occassionally, I have my moments of despair
<br>
here. This last week it was about spending two days trying to understand
<br>
where some sine and cosine terms came from in my advisor's colleague's
<br>
code. My advisor was on travel, and after many of pieces of paper where I
<br>
had drawn stupid little triangles trying to figure out the angles, and
<br>
two days of giving myself a headache about it, I wrote the fellow who
<br>
wrote the code an email. His answer was a quick phrase, that actually
<br>
didn't help me at all, so then I really felt like an idiot, and I lose my
<br>
courage to ask anyone else. I can bear to look like an idiot to my
<br>
advisor's colleagues not more than once, you see. So I stared at
<br>
my toes, stared at the celing, waiting for the waves of despair to
<br>
pass, and I think about the church two doors down. And so it occurred
<br>
to me that *these* kinds of moments are those that people go to church
<br>
for. If I walked in those doors,then I sincerely doubt that God will show
<br>
me where thet sine and cosine terms came from, but at least the
<br>
surroundings would provide a comfort and relief.
<br>
<p>No, I didn't go into that church, but I can say that I understand
<br>
a little bit better about folks' religious tendencies, and it is
<br>
pretty hard sometimes to go inward rather than outward to find
<br>
that relief.
