<br>
The general taboo on elimination products in western society mean
<br>
that most people have an inordinate fear of urine. So you can expect
<br>
a threat-reaction.
<br>
<p>Again: the idea of sticking a cream pie in someone's face is to
<br>
make *them* look silly, or demonstrate that they've got no self-
<br>
control by provoking an over-reaction. 
<br>
<p>Doing something (a jar of warm urine? spitting?) that the audience
<br>
(who are the people you're trying to influence!) interpret as an attack
<br>
undermines the whole purpose of the pie-in-the-face.
