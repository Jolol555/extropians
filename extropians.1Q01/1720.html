I know of no court opinion or statute that would prevent deep linking per se. 
<br>
&nbsp;You probably face a bluff, and a dumb one at that.
<br>
<p>I can imagine a successful claim that relies on a showing that the linking 
<br>
party *agreed* to not engage in deep linking, said agreement most likely 
<br>
arising by way of a click-through license on the plaintiff's homepage.  But, 
<br>
of course, if the deep link is not blocked by a CGI script or other self-help 
<br>
measure, it would be entirely possible to access the page cited without 
<br>
clicking-through the license.  See, eg., Ticketmaster Corp. v. Tickets.com, 
<br>
Inc., No. CV-99-7654 (C.D. Cal., March 27, 2000) (dismissing as preempted by 
<br>
copyright law a trespass to chattles claim based on unauthorized 
<br>
hyperlinking--without clarifying whether public invitation to enter site had 
<br>
been revoked with regard to defendant--but declining to preempt contract 
<br>
claim based on same facts); Ticketmaster Corp. v. Tickets.com, Inc., No. 
<br>
CV-99- 7654 (C.D. Cal., August 10, 2000) (denying motion for preliminary 
<br>
injunction).
<br>
<p><p>Framing a deep-linked site (or any site, for that matter) may, if done in a 
<br>
particularly misleading way, give rise to an unfair competition claim.  But 
<br>
you would have to represent another's work as your own to suffer liability 
<br>
for that practice.  See, e.g., Ticketmaster Corp. v. Microsoft Corp. (S.D. 
<br>
Cal. complaint filed Apr. 28, 1997) (alleging that linking violated 
<br>
trademarks) (settled--probably because Ticketmaster devised a technical 
<br>
solution).
<br>
<p>Absent that, I can imagine a claim only if the use that results from the 
<br>
hyperlink somehow harms the site being linked to.  See, e.g., E-Bay v. 
<br>
Bidder's Edge, Inc., No. C-99-21200 RMW (N.D. Cal. May 24, 2000) (applying 
<br>
trespass to chattles theory to grant preliminary injunction against 
<br>
unauthorized access by automated web crawlers to publicly available data) .  
<br>
But will casual readers really slow down a server?  Not likely.
<br>
<p>It bears noting that a link does not by any stretch constitute a trespass to 
<br>
a web site.  The link itself operates functionally like a footnote in a 
<br>
paper; it is the browser accessing the linking site that does the work of 
<br>
pulling up the deep-linked page, just as it remains up to readers of a paper 
<br>
to hunt down works cited in its footnotes.
<br>
<p>If you get unduly hassled about deep-linking, you could simply type the link 
<br>
as text into your web-document, leaving it to readers to cut-and-paste the 
<br>
URL into their own browsers.  That's a pain to readers, of course, forcing 
<br>
them to do manually what their browsers would do automatically with a 
<br>
hyperlink.  But attorneys can be pains to deal with, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does anyone know what the law says about &quot;deep linking&quot;. Say you write some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  comments on an article appearing on a magazine's Web page, and you link 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  directly to the article. (The article appears in a new browser, exactly as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it would appear if the viewer had gone there directly.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What if the magazine sent you a Cease and Desist letter, and told you that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it did not permitting linking to its content (which is freely open to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  public), only to its main page?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This sounds ridiculous to me. The magazine would be turning away freely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  given traffic that it would otherwise not receive. What I'm really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  interested in is not so much the silliness of such a policy, but whether 
</em><br>
an 
<br>
<em>&gt;  online magazine can legally enforce such a claim. I would think the law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  does *not* support this, but sometimes &quot;the law is an ass&quot;, so I'm asking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the many-brained List if it knows the law in this area.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I can't imagine telling someone, &quot;No, no, I don't permit you to link to 
</em><br>
The 
<br>
<em>&gt;  Extropian Principles. You may only link to my home page.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Thanks,
</em><br>
