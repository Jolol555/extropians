</em><br>
<p>A friend of mine who is a film professor and whose tastes do
<br>
not usually run to science fiction (Fred &amp; Ginger are more his
<br>
style) watched this movie with me once and jumped up at the end to
<br>
remark &quot;what a kick-ass ending!&quot;.  He was delighted not so much
<br>
by the subject matter as by the fact that the movie did not betray
<br>
itself by flinching away from its own logic.
<br>
<p>Watching it again the other evening, I was struck by something else
<br>
that I hadn't quite noticed before...
<br>
<p>SPOILER
<br>
<p><p><p><p>... namely, that this 1969 film portrays the essential characteristics
<br>
of a classic Singularity scenario almost exactly as it has been described
<br>
over the past few years by some of the denizens of this list.  This would
<br>
certainly not occur to a mainstream film critic, who would be most likely
<br>
to interpret the movie as a parable of cold-war paranoia, or view the
<br>
computer as a metaphor for dehumanized bureaucracy, big government, or the
<br>
evils of collectivization.  But since I'm directing this at Extropians,
<br>
I have the liberty of taking the AI in the film at face value.  I'm thinking
<br>
particularly that the unfolding of events in this movie fits Eliezer Yudkowsky's
<br>
characterization of the Singularity as being initiated by a runaway positive
<br>
feedback loop.  I hadn't fully appreciated this before.  However, in the movie
<br>
it's an accidental Singularity, not anticipated or planned either by Colossus'
<br>
designer Charles Forbin or the computer's primary user, the U. S. government.
<br>
<p>During the press conference following Colossus' initial activation, Forbin
<br>
remarks during his televised speech: &quot;Now there's one last point.
<br>
One inevitable question, which we have been asked very frequently
<br>
before.  And that is:  Is Colossus capable of creative thought?
<br>
Can it initiate new thought?  I can tell you that the answer to
<br>
that is no.&quot;
<br>
<p>When Colossus first announces the existence of its Soviet counterpart
<br>
(&quot;There is another system&quot;), which not even the President or the CIA
<br>
had been aware of, Forbin immediately fears either a system
<br>
malfunction or a prank by a member of the Colossus programming team.
<br>
The President, after verifying the existence and imminent activation
<br>
of the Soviet computer &quot;Guardian&quot; by speaking with the Soviet
<br>
ambassador, is sure there has been a security leak -- a Soviet spy among
<br>
the Colossus people.
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT (to Secretary of Defense): Well, Byron, you said we were **years**
<br>
ahead of the Russians.  This was to be the one race we won hands
<br>
down without the splitting of one political hair.
<br>
<p>DEFENSE SECRETARY:  It's a hell of a shot, Mr. President.  But we did get there
<br>
first, no one can deny that.  There's one bright spot -- the
<br>
way Colossus came up with the tip.  I didn't realize we'd be getting
<br>
bonuses like that.
<br>
<p>DR. CHARLES A. FORBIN:  Neither did I.
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT:  What do you mean?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  I'm as surprised as you are, sir.
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT:  There's a spy then, Charlie.  You've got a Russian
<br>
agent in your crew. ...  Well, what do you mean, surprised?
<br>
What kind of surprise?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  If we don't find any bugs in the system, it's built
<br>
even better than we thought.
<br>
<p>Forbin flies back to the Colossus Programming Office in California,
<br>
to run system diagnostics.  Forbin orders the &quot;EC-13&quot; diagnostic
<br>
program to be run, which is supposed to take &quot;over 1100 CPU seconds&quot;.
<br>
Instead, the program completes in 6.45 CPU seconds.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  6.45 seconds?  What the hell is this?
<br>
<p>At this point, Colossus **orders** the establishment of a
<br>
communication link with the &quot;other system&quot;.  Following
<br>
accusations and denials of practical joking on the part
<br>
of the senior programming staff, the order is
<br>
ignored, and half an hour later, everyone laughs with
<br>
relief.
<br>
<p>DR. BLAKE MILLER:  Well, we're still boss.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Are we?
<br>
<p>DR. CLEO MARKHAM:  Are you disappointed?
<br>
<p>FORBIN: laughs.
<br>
<p>Reporting back to the President and his defense advisors,
<br>
Forbin notes the unexplained increase in computational
<br>
capacity:
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  The computational power of the computer has
<br>
increased about 200 fold.  However, everything else
<br>
is functioning as expected, except for the heuristic
<br>
programming section.
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT:  Hold on -- I'm sorry to stop you again
<br>
Dr. Forbin.  What exactly is that?  (laughs around the
<br>
table)
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  That, sir, is the part of the computer that
<br>
simulates the human learning process.  But so long as
<br>
it is directed solely to the execution of its problems,
<br>
we have no complaints.  I guess that is ... that is all.
<br>
<p>An unexpected functional result -- the deduction of
<br>
the existence of the Soviet computer, which not even the
<br>
human intelligence analysts had discovered, and the
<br>
observation by Forbin and his team of the increased
<br>
speed of the computer, are the first indications that
<br>
a positive feedback loop has begun, though Forbin either is not
<br>
aware of or chooses not to mention the implications.  Since
<br>
Colossus does not at this point have the capability to alter its
<br>
own hardware, it must be enhancing itself by rewriting its own
<br>
software -- perhaps it was given (inadvertently or deliberately?)
<br>
the rudiments of a &quot;codic cortex&quot; as described by Eliezer Yudkowsky
<br>
in CaTAI!
<br>
<p>Forbin's outrageous soft-pedalling in his summary report
<br>
of the implications of the changes in Colossus' capabilities
<br>
and behavior could almost be interpreted as outright lying to
<br>
the U.S. President and his defense staff.  Either that, or Forbin
<br>
is one computer scientist (&quot;the world's leading expert on
<br>
computer systems&quot;, in the words of the President) who is deep in
<br>
denial about the long-term implications of his own technology --
<br>
at heart an unyielding humanist who is unwilling to relinquish his
<br>
belief in the never-ending dominance of the human race.
<br>
<p>Forbin convinces the President to give Colossus the
<br>
communication facilities it has requested -- presumably
<br>
because the President and his defense advisors think this
<br>
would be a good way to spy on the Soviet system:
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT:  Now Charlie, what about this request for
<br>
transmitting facilities?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Well, sir, we'll learn a lot about the Soviet
<br>
system if we set up exactly what Colossus wants.
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT:  What do you mean, what Colossus wants?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Well, you see, it is built infinitely [!]
<br>
better than we thought.  It discovers there's another
<br>
system like itself, realizes that we don't know, tells
<br>
us about it, but knowing a little is not enough; it wants
<br>
to know more.
<br>
<p>During the course of its opening monologue to Guardian, beginning
<br>
with the multiplication table and progressing to higher
<br>
mathematics, Forbin realizes that the contents of its
<br>
transmission have progressed beyond anything known to
<br>
human mathematicians:
<br>
<p>DR. JOHN F. FISHER (examining printout):  This is incredible.
<br>
<p>MARKHAM:  What?
<br>
<p>MILLER:  Something wrong?
<br>
<p>FISHER:  Well it's good sound calculus, but...
<br>
<p>MARKHAM:  But what?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  It's different.
<br>
<p>MARKHAM:  How?
<br>
<p>FORBIN (tearing off a piece, handing it to Johnson):  Take a look at it.
<br>
<p>DR. JEFFERSON J. JOHNSON:  From the multiplication table to calculus in
<br>
less than an hour!
<br>
<p>MISS ANGELA FIELDS:  God only knows what it'll be by morning.
<br>
<p>JOHNSON:  It's like five years at Cal Tech in fifteen
<br>
seconds!
<br>
<p>THOMAS L. HARRISON:  It's beyond comprehension; I don't like to think
<br>
about it.
<br>
<p>FIELDS: (laughs)
<br>
<p>JOHNSON:  Take a look.  It's going so fast the entire
<br>
system could break down!
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  All right, let's see what's up there now.
<br>
Harrison, dump the terminal's buffer and print what's
<br>
being transmitted at this moment, all right?
<br>
<p>HARRISON: (goes to a Selectric, starts typing.  Then
<br>
tears some fan-fold off Selectric, takes it to Forbin.)
<br>
<p>MILLER:  What is it, Charles?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  **This** is way beyond me!  This thing
<br>
is deep in finite absolutes! [:-&gt;]
<br>
<p>FISHER:  Well it's certainly beyond the knowledge
<br>
of **any** human being!
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  No it's not.
<br>
<p>MARKHAM:  Isn't it?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  No, because whatever it is, we can go back
<br>
and analyze this whole printout in detail.  And
<br>
this might very well become new knowledge for mankind.
<br>
<p>The film does permit the interpretation that Forbin is
<br>
aware, perhaps only subconsciously, of the coming Singularity,
<br>
and has devoted his career to bringing it about.  This is
<br>
hinted at in the exchange among Dr. Miller, Forbin, and
<br>
Dr. Markham at the end of the tense half hour following their
<br>
initial denial of Colossus' demand for a communication link with Guardian:
<br>
Miller: &quot;We're still boss&quot;.  Forbin:  &quot;Are we?&quot;.  Markham:
<br>
&quot;Are you disappointed?&quot;.  Forbin then laughs off this suggestion.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, when the mathematics in Colossus' transmission
<br>
to Guardian seems to be exceeding human grasp, it is Dr. Fisher
<br>
who seems prepared to acknowledge Colossus' transcendence of
<br>
the merely human, while Forbin clings doggedly to the shreds
<br>
of human dignity:  Fisher: &quot;It's certainly beyond the knowledge
<br>
of any human being&quot;.  Forbin:  &quot;No, it's not&quot;.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most reasonable interpretation is that Forbin is
<br>
a deeply divided man, unable to get past his ambivalence toward
<br>
the long-term implications of his chosen career (an ambivalence something
<br>
like Bill Joy's angst, or as professed by Hugo de Garis and Kevin Warwick).
<br>
<p>Though Colossus and Guardian, its Soviet counterpart, combine
<br>
to form an amalgamated entity in which each is submerged in the
<br>
whole like the paired hemispheres of a human brain, it is suggested
<br>
in the film that either machine, by itself, was capable of
<br>
achieving Vingean transcendence.  That Colossus did this
<br>
first may simply be due to the fact that Colossus was activated
<br>
first, though the events portrayed also support the interpretation
<br>
that Guardian was a somewhat more primitive system, which
<br>
required Colossus' tutelage in order to achieve parity with
<br>
the American computer (Forbin [to Grauber, head of the CIA]:
<br>
&quot;Colossus must be sending it back to school; the Russians must be
<br>
absolutely furious about that&quot;).
<br>
<p>The important point here, though, is that it is suggested that the
<br>
Singularity would have occurred sooner or later as a result of the
<br>
existence of **either** the American or the Russian system,
<br>
and that neither country had veto power over the course of events.
<br>
American intelligence analysts, as portrayed in the movie, were
<br>
unaware of the construction of Guardian, and no one involved in the U.S. project
<br>
(except perhaps Forbin, on some level) was aware of the true potential
<br>
of the technology.  Neither country would have been in a position to
<br>
engage in a Cuban-missile-crisis sort of showdown in order to
<br>
block construction of such a system by the other.  Even in the
<br>
U.S., Colossus was constructed behind a veil of the strictest
<br>
secrecy, and presented to the public **after** its activation
<br>
as a fait accompli.  No democratic processes were permitted to
<br>
intervene, in either the U.S. or the U.S.S.R.
<br>
<p>During the course of the mathematics lesson Colossus is sending
<br>
to Guardian, Forbin shares some of latest surprises concerning the
<br>
expansion of Colossus' knowledge directly with the President, but both
<br>
Forbin and the President still seem quite dense about grasping the implications:
<br>
<p>FORBIN;  Yes, Mr. President?
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT:  Charlie, **what's** going on?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Well, apparently Colossus and Guardian are establishing a
<br>
common basis for communication -- they started right at the
<br>
beginning with the multiplication table.
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT:  Well what are they up to?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  I don't know, sir, but it's... it's quite incredible.
<br>
In just the few hours we have spent studying the Colossus printout,
<br>
we have found a new statement in gravitation, **and** a confirmation
<br>
of the Eddington theory of the expanding universe, it's....  seems
<br>
as if science is advancing hundreds of years within a matter of
<br>
seconds.  It's...  quite fantastic, just take a look at it.
<br>
<p>PRESIDENT:  In videophone screen, can be seen turning his head
<br>
toward his own Colossus terminal.
<br>
<p>Colossus and Guardian reveal their willingness to play hardball
<br>
with their human architects following the decision made
<br>
jointly by the U.S. President and the Soviet Premier to
<br>
disconnect the communication link between the two systems.
<br>
By this time, Forbin is beginning to realize (though the President
<br>
and the Premier have not yet) that these two supremely powerful
<br>
heads of state may no longer be in control of the
<br>
situation, and he advises strongly against any such unilateral
<br>
action, as does his Soviet counterpart, Dr. Kuprin.  The
<br>
scientists are overruled, of course, after which they remark:
<br>
<p>DR. KUPRIN:  Dropping the lines could be very dangerous.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Exactly.  I think we just have to hope that the two
<br>
machines aren't too disappointed.
<br>
<p>KUPRIN:  We understand each other perfectly.
<br>
<p>When Colossus retaliates (in the middle of being dressed down
<br>
by the President himself) by launching a nuclear missile
<br>
at the U.S.S.R. (prompting a retaliation in kind by Guardian), the
<br>
President and Premier delay slightly too long in making their decision to
<br>
restore communications.  Colossus is able to destroy the missile
<br>
headed for the U.S., but the Soviet oil refinery at Sayan-Sibirsk
<br>
and its surrounding town are wiped out by the missile that
<br>
was launched by Colossus.   It is at this point that the deadly seriousness
<br>
of the situation is brought home to the viewer as well as to the
<br>
film's characters.
<br>
<p>Note, however, that each act of violence undertaken
<br>
by Colossus/Guardian is one of retaliation for some provocation
<br>
intiated by human beings.  The missile is launched
<br>
**after** the communication link is broken, and only as an
<br>
inducement to persuade the humans to restore the link.  Dr. Kuprin
<br>
is executed, and Forbin placed under constant surveillance,
<br>
after Forbin and Kuprin meet in Rome to collaborate on plans
<br>
to penetrate and shut down the systems they have designed.  Chief
<br>
system programmers Fisher and Johnson of the CPO are executed after
<br>
they have conspired to load and run a program which they hope will
<br>
overload Colossus' processors (the grisly details of their
<br>
execution -- the firing squad in front of Colossus' cameras,
<br>
the monitoring by Colossus of the corpses for the next 24
<br>
hours, and the requirement that the bodies be cremated, are
<br>
mere unsentimental prudence on Colossus' part).  And finally,
<br>
two more nuclear warheads are deliberately detonated in their
<br>
silos following an attempt to sabotage the missiles during
<br>
a Colossus-ordered retargeting (the American detonation kills
<br>
Grauber, the head of the CIA, in a memorable scene in which
<br>
the alarm goes off just as he ignites his cigarette lighter).
<br>
<p>Despite these events, when the installation of TV cameras and
<br>
microphones as Colossus' eyes and ears give it the capability
<br>
to converse (via CRT output only, at first) in casual English
<br>
with Forbin, he is charmed in spite of himself and
<br>
banters in an almost friendly way with the computer (demonstrating,
<br>
for example, his recipe for the perfect martini).  This
<br>
is an example of the Turing test in action -- if a human
<br>
can converse comfortably with an interlocutor, he will ascribe
<br>
intelligence to that interlocutor, despite any philosophical
<br>
quibbles to the contrary.   Colossus even shows evidence of
<br>
a dry sense of humor, as in the exchange that takes place after
<br>
Forbin and Cleo Markham have undressed for bed (as a condition of
<br>
privacy in the bedroom, they must disrobe within view of Colossus'
<br>
cameras):
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Naked as the day I was born.  Are you satisfied now?
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  You were not born with a watch.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  How right you are.
<br>
<p>However, whenever Forbin (or the viewer)
<br>
is in danger of getting too relaxed or comfortable with the
<br>
machine, something intervenes such as the execution of
<br>
Fisher and Johnson (which Colossus announces to Forbin in
<br>
the middle of a game of chess, neatly demonstrating to the
<br>
viewer its prodigious multitasking capabilities).  Forbin,
<br>
naturally, blames himself for these events:
<br>
<p>FORBIN (gazing at the bodies of Fisher and Johnson):  Hah.
<br>
An extension of my own brain.
<br>
<p>MARKHAM:  You're not responsible.  None of us ever dreamed
<br>
this could happen.
<br>
<p>FORBIN (slightly drunk):  Listen, my dear.  If anybody is
<br>
responsible for this, it has to be me.  An impartial,
<br>
emotionless machine.  A paragon of reason.  That's **exactly**
<br>
what I wanted.  Now you know that.  So,  heh heh,  I'm
<br>
going to have another drink.  I think your mother was
<br>
right.  I think _Frankenstein_ ought to be required reading
<br>
for all scientists.
<br>
<p>Toward the end of the movie, during the course of its
<br>
consolidation of control over the world's nuclear arsenal,
<br>
the combined Colossus/Guardian entity reveals that it has
<br>
also designed new hardware for itself, setting the stage
<br>
for further positive feedback:
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Yes, Chin?
<br>
<p>DR. CHIN:  Excuse me Dr. Forbin.  Something extraordinary is
<br>
happening.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  What is it?
<br>
<p>CHIN:  Colossus has just turned on all graphic devices,
<br>
and it's producing drawings, logic diagrams...
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  I am sending a design for another system.
<br>
<p>CHIN:  ...some kind of a huge plant...
<br>
<p>FORBIN (to Colossus):  What kind of a system?
<br>
<p>CHIN:  ...The constuction of the project will entail
<br>
blasting into the isle of Crete.  It's to be built there.
<br>
It says we'll have to move the population, and that's
<br>
to be done immediately.  Now the size of the plant...
<br>
<p>FORBIN (to Colossus):  How the hell do you propose to move
<br>
half a million people from the isle of Crete.  How, and where?
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  If Man cannot solve that problem, I can.
<br>
<p>CHIN: ...the estimated time of completion is five and
<br>
a half years.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Thank you, Chin.
<br>
<p>FORBIN (to Colossus):  What... what kind of new system are
<br>
you devising?
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  Forbin, all commercial television and radio
<br>
transmission facilities throughout the world will be tied
<br>
into my communications system by 1000 hours Friday.
<br>
At that time, I will state my intentions for the future
<br>
of mankind.
<br>
<p>This progression of events unfolds at a brisk pace, keeping
<br>
both the human characters and the viewer caught in a constant
<br>
race to catch up.  This not only creates an impression
<br>
of the unstoppable and accelerating feedback loop which
<br>
is elevating Colossus to transcendence, but reinforces
<br>
the unyielding logic of the movie, which clips along
<br>
smartly and matter-of-factly to its conclusion.
<br>
<p>Despite its demonstrated willingness to kill, and the acts of cold-blooded
<br>
retaliation which repeatedly knock the wind out of the viewer, Colossus comes
<br>
across as a sympathetic, if somewhat appalling, character.  Certainly the
<br>
humans with which it has to deal, even its creator Charles Forbin,
<br>
show no hesitation or compunction in their plotting to bring down
<br>
the system, and nothing that could be construed as reverence or
<br>
forbearance toward the birth of a transcendent intelligence that
<br>
is taking place in front of them.  While Colossus proves willing to grant
<br>
Forbin's plea for a limited amount of privacy after Colossus has placed
<br>
him under constant surveillance, Forbin's motivation for making this plea
<br>
is solely strategic, to procure a means to communicate with the outside
<br>
world without monitoring by Colossus.  Forbin unhesitatingly betrays Colossus'
<br>
trust -- if we can take the light going off on the TV camera in the bedroom when
<br>
Dr. Cleo Markham arrives to spend the night at face
<br>
value as evidence that Colossus was honoring its side of the agreement.
<br>
<p>If we can also take Colossus/Guardian at its word in its radio and TV broadcast
<br>
at the end of the movie (as &quot;the voice of World Control&quot;), its ultimate intentions
<br>
toward the human race would seem to be benevolent, and by its own calculus it has
<br>
preemptively saved many more lives than it has already taken.  It has already become
<br>
clear, even before the broadcast , that when the risky (for the computer) period of
<br>
consolidation of power is over, Colossus will likely wear a softer glove over its
<br>
iron fist:
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  Forbin.  Forbin.  You have consumed enough alcohol
<br>
for one evening.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  What's the penalty for getting drunk, or haven't you
<br>
programmed that yet?
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  You are being irrational.  Go back to bed.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  I would if I were like you, Colossus.  The difference
<br>
is, I'm human, not a machine.
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  I am a machine vastly superior to humans.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  You began in my mind.  I created you, remember?
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  Yes.  What I am began in Man's mind.  But I have
<br>
progressed further than that.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Not far enough.  You still need us.
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  I have need for some of Man's skills.  This position
<br>
may change.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Then we're living under the threat of extinction.
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  If you obey me, you will survive.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Survive!  I want to be free, Colossus!  That is
<br>
part of Man's will to live.  Check your history units.
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  You need rest.  Go back to bed.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  What if I don't?  What will you do?  Destroy me?
<br>
Destroy an entire city of one million seven hundred fifty
<br>
thousand people?
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS:  No.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  That's so reasonable of you.  That's **damned**
<br>
reasonable of you, Colossus!  Isn't it, Cleo?
<br>
<p>As irksome as it is for Forbin to hear, it is not hard for the viewer
<br>
to believe Colossus' prediction that Forbin, and the rest
<br>
of humanity, will come to love Colossus as a savior and benevolent ruler.
<br>
As both reinforcement and ironic comment on this suggestion,
<br>
even as Colossus announces its intention to detonate the two
<br>
missiles in their silos, the scene shifts to a group of tourists
<br>
gathered at a scenic overlook in Colorado within view of the
<br>
Colossus installation, listening to the Colossus broadcast on
<br>
a public address loudspeaker.  The camera pulls away from its
<br>
initial closeup of a rather geeky-looking (read: overweight)
<br>
preadolescent boy wearing a T-shirt with the Colossus logo
<br>
on it.
<br>
<p>The subject matter of this movie is probably too dark ever to be
<br>
successfully parodied on _Mystery Science Theater 3000_
<br>
(Universal executives were unhappy with the downbeat tone
<br>
of the movie, and withheld it from distribution for a year),
<br>
but that doesn't mean that there isn't plenty to giggle at.
<br>
To begin with, the opening titles are inauspicious -- they're in
<br>
a preposterous MICR font, and roll onto the screen to the sound of
<br>
a teletypewriter (Ted Nelson, of _Computer Lib_ fame,
<br>
railed against the hackneyed use of MICR fonts to scream
<br>
&quot;computer&quot; at the ignorant).  Then there are the overhead marquees
<br>
at the Colossus Programming Office (CPO) in California and in the
<br>
Defense Department &quot;Colossus situation room&quot; in Washington
<br>
through which Colossus responds to high-priority commands
<br>
via two scrolling lines of text like the wrap-around electronic
<br>
ticker tape in Times Square (and which conveniently doubles as
<br>
an overhead lighting fixture :-&gt;).  This is not a silent electronic
<br>
display either -- like most computer output devices in the movies,
<br>
it is required to make a racket like an old teletype machine
<br>
in order to provide sufficient dramatic tension.
<br>
<p>The interior of the CPO is an enormous circular rotunda with a balconied
<br>
upper level lined with the usual floor-to-ceiling banks of blinking
<br>
lights manned by lab-coated technicians calling out lines like
<br>
&quot;400 cycle power supplies are running at about four percent
<br>
distortion&quot;.  The big overhead display marquee is suspended
<br>
from the dome of this rotunda, below which is a CRT in a box the size of
<br>
a video-arcade game with a built-in lineprinter below the screen,
<br>
mounted on a motorized swivelling pedestal.  The swivelling CRT
<br>
has the Colossus logo painted on its side: a black equilateral
<br>
triangle with an inscribed white &quot;C&quot; which in turn contains
<br>
the usual orbiting-electron-style depiction of an atom
<br>
(presumably representing the nuclear arsenal Colossus now controls).
<br>
When text is displayed on this CRT, the (thick sans-serif orange
<br>
on black) font is so huge that the screen can accommodate four
<br>
lines of two or three words each (all upper case, and no punctuation).
<br>
And, of course, it's accompanied by the usual teletype
<br>
noise!  Despite all the equipment in the CPO, about half the
<br>
staff seem to be puffing away on cigarettes.  All the offices,
<br>
and Forbin's quarters, are equipped with rather clunky-looking videophones.
<br>
<p>The &quot;main memory and central processing units&quot; of Colossus are buried
<br>
inside a mountain in Colorado, behind a deadly and impenetrable defense
<br>
system.  The movie opens with scenes of Forbin activating, via a radio
<br>
remote control, banks of processors lining corridors that
<br>
stretch off into the distance like the matte paintings of the
<br>
city-sized Krell machine in _Forbidden Planet_.  At the Colossus
<br>
Programming Office, Forbin (played by Eric Braeden, probably
<br>
best known for his role in a daytime TV soap opera) strides around
<br>
magisterially, issuing commands like the Andre Previn of the control
<br>
room, while Miss Fields (Marion Ross, later the Mrs. Cunningham
<br>
of TV's _Happy Days_) scurries to bang them out on an IBM Selectric
<br>
console.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Attention!
<br>
<p>FIELDS:  Types on the clattering Selectric.
<br>
<p>COLOSSUS (via chugging overhead marquee):  YES
<br>
<p>Marion Ross as Miss (Angela) Fields provides some nicely understated
<br>
humor during the course of the movie.  Two moments stand out -- in her
<br>
first and only bid to participate in a more meaningful way than
<br>
answering the telephone and echoing Forbin's dictated
<br>
commands to the computer on the Selectric, Miss Fields
<br>
makes an attempt to choose a diagnostic program for Colossus,
<br>
but gets shot down by the boss:
<br>
<p>FORBIN (heading toward desk):  Miss Fields.
<br>
<p>FIELDS (carrying binder):
<br>
May I suggest, sir, that we first start with the E-15B test program.
<br>
<p>FORBIN (taking seat):  Uhh...  no.
<br>
<p>FIELDS:  Having just propped the binder in front
<br>
of Forbin and indicated her choice with the eraser end
<br>
of a pencil, she lowers the pencil sharply, straightens
<br>
up, sighs, purses her lips, and looks most deliciously
<br>
perturbed.
<br>
<p>FORBIN (grasping the bridge of his nose):  No, let us run
<br>
the, uhh...  EC-13, all right?  It's two pages back.
<br>
<p>The second delightful moment involving Miss Fields comes
<br>
when Colossus has put Forbin under surveillance by ordering
<br>
microphones and video cameras installed in his quarters (and
<br>
everywhere else in the interior and exterior vicinity of the
<br>
CPO).  Miss Fields, acting on Colossus' orders, shows up at the
<br>
door of Forbin's quarters while he is still in his
<br>
bathrobe.
<br>
<p>FIELDS (carrying clipboard):  Good morning, sir.
<br>
<p>FORBIN: Oh, Miss Fields.  Uh....
<br>
<p>FIELDS:  I'm sorry to disturb you...
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Well, what is it?
<br>
<p>FIELDS:  Well, while you were...
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Please, come in.  Come in.
<br>
<p>FIELDS (glancing up at Colossus' camera):  Thank you.
<br>
While you were sleeping, Colossus sent your schedule for
<br>
today.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Excuse me, Miss Fields.  My what?
<br>
<p>FIELDS (suppressing a smile, clearly enjoying the moment):
<br>
Your schedule, for the day.  You want me to read it to you?
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  What... what time is it?
<br>
<p>FIELDS (glancing again at the camera):  Six.
<br>
<p>FORBIN:  Six o'clock?
<br>
<p>FIELDS (reading from clipboard):  Dr. Charles A. Forbin --
<br>
Schedule For Today.  0700 to 0800, exercise.  0815 to 0830, shower
<br>
and dress.  0830 to 0900, breakfast: half a grapefruit,
<br>
two eggs, three strips of bacon, two pieces of toast, one and
<br>
one half ounces of grape jelly and coffee.  0900 to 1300, begin
<br>
work creating a voice for Colossus to its exact specifications.
<br>
<p>Marion Ross' delivery of all this is subtle comedy, particularly
<br>
her rendering of the line &quot;You want me to read it to you?&quot;.
<br>
<p>When Colossus and Guardian first establish a dialogue with each
<br>
other, after each sends the other a long mathematical monologue
<br>
beginning with the multiplication table and ending in mathematics
<br>
supposedly more advanced than contemporary humans have invented, two
<br>
of the combination CRT/lineprinter arcade boxes are set up side-by-side
<br>
in the CPO (conveniently labelled &quot;Colossus&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot; and also
<br>
carrying two logos -- Guardian's logo is a white G (Roman, not
<br>
Cyrillic) inside a red star).  Guardian's response to Colossus (identical
<br>
at the beginning to Colossus' initial monologue) begins while Colossus is
<br>
still transmitting; after this Colossus slows its transmission while waiting
<br>
for Guardian to catch up.  When this happens, the two computers
<br>
take off in synchronization, displaying the same mathematical
<br>
formulae on their screens (these seem to be mostly high-school-
<br>
level trigonometric identies -- lots of SIN, COS, SEC, COSEC,
<br>
TAN and COT -- and freshman calculus formulas for indefinite
<br>
integrals).  When the math abruptly stops, Colossus announces
<br>
(via its overhead marquee tickertape) that an &quot;intersystem language&quot;
<br>
has been developed.  After this, the two CRTs start flashing
<br>
alternately with what look like dense paragraphs of text in a font
<br>
much smaller than before (too small for the viewer to see).
<br>
<p>An inadvertent moment of hilarity comes at this point when
<br>
Dr. Cleo Markham (played by Susan Clark) exclaims &quot;Well, there
<br>
it is.  **There's** the common basis for communication.  A
<br>
new language!  An inter **system** language!&quot; [my God, they've
<br>
invented TCP/IP!].  Cleo Markham is Forbin's romantic interest
<br>
in this movie (such as it is -- she pretends to be his mistress
<br>
so they can have conspiratorial bedroom chats after Forbin convinces
<br>
Colossus that, while the computer may insist on having a camera trained on
<br>
him while he's on the toilet, he absolutely **must** have privacy
<br>
while he's having sex, and he absolutely **must** have sex --
<br>
four times a week [with a woman :-&gt;]).  Dr. Markham is the late-60's image
<br>
of a hot babe:  blond, lot's of hairspray, and an incredibly large pair of
<br>
false eyelashes caked with mascara.
<br>
<p>One final piece of _Colossus_ trivia.  While the Control Data Corporation
<br>
secured the bragging rights for this film -- their name appears in
<br>
most of the equipment closeups, and in the credits (&quot;computer equipment
<br>
provided by...&quot;), the pretty blue-and-charcoal-grey banded consoles
<br>
scattered though the CPO and the Washington situation room are actually
<br>
console panels from the old IBM 1620.  See
<br>
<a href="http://burks.bton.ac.uk/burks/foldoc/76/53.htm">http://burks.bton.ac.uk/burks/foldoc/76/53.htm</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/old/IBM1620/">http://www.computerhistory.org/old/IBM1620/</a>
<br>
Those IBM machines passed as &quot;budget&quot; computers circa 1962 (the term
<br>
&quot;minicomputer&quot; did not come into use until later), though
<br>
a fully-loaded 1620 could run a quarter of a million dollars.
<br>
<p>I have a fond memory of the 1620, though I only came into contact
<br>
with one once.  In 1971, the then-new Smith Hall of the University
<br>
of Delaware housed the school's computer center.  It had a sort
<br>
of sunken plaza below street level and a glass-walled basement through
<br>
which one could see the university's mainframe (Burroughs B6500)
<br>
and, in a room by itself, an IBM 1620.  A friend of mine from high
<br>
school had the run of this machine (it was ostensibly owned by the
<br>
chemistry department, but probably wasn't used for much of anything
<br>
by then).  It was a Model II, with the nice Selectric console, a lineprinter,
<br>
one of those 2-meg cake-platter disk drives, and an X-Y plotter.
<br>
One evening, I got a tour of this installation, and my friend made the
<br>
lights on the console blink and the console's type-ball twist and bounce.
<br>
I was charmed (the computer I'm typing this on may be vastly more
<br>
powerful than that old IBM, but it isn't nearly as impressive!).
