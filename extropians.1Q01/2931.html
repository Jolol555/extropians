<em>&gt;You know, I'll probably get all kinds of flak for this, but...
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that extropianism in general is a forward-looking 
<br>
philosophy.  My personal preference is to limit serious speculation 
<br>
to the &quot;just over the horizon&quot; issues, since trying to look further 
<br>
than that involves so many variables that extrapolating from the 
<br>
present leads to a lot of guessing and wishing.
<br>
<p>In a group like this, though, not everyone is going to agree on where 
<br>
to draw the line.  Plus, there is the entertaining aspect of 
<br>
speculating about the future - even if it is just wishing.
<br>
<p>If it gets too bad, I'll join my voice to yours in asking for a new 
<br>
mailing list, but for now, I think that all the wild-eyed speculation 
<br>
stuff is mostly harmless and sometimes entertaining.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
