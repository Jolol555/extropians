 ('binary' encoding is not supported, stored as-is)
IMHO, we are pretty much at human brain bit rate
<br>
equivalency right now. According to the calculations in
<br>
Moravec at
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm">http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>the human brain approximates 1e14 flops of computer power.
<br>
(His calculation seems substantially better than the
<br>
calculations based on number of neurons x number of axons x
<br>
axon frequency, being based on the functional equivalent
<br>
processing power.)
<br>
<p>Clearly we could have a 1e14 flops computer network today
<br>
if we so chose, simply by buying enough computers. (Note
<br>
that a network of computers makes a good approximation of
<br>
the human brain, since both are highly parallel in nature.)
<br>
However, that could be quite expensive. What we are
<br>
interested in then is not so much the raw processing power
<br>
of a potential computer cluster, since we could, given
<br>
enough money, have built a 1e14 flops network of machine in
<br>
the 1950s. Rather what we are interested in is the point at
<br>
which the cost per flop of processing power is cheaper in a
<br>
computer than in a human engineer. At that point, given the
<br>
right software, we can replace our engineer with our
<br>
network of computers (for the same cost), and thus start
<br>
the accelerating improvements the singularity predicts.
<br>
<p>How many flops of engineer can we buy for one dollar?
<br>
(Excuse the US-centric approach, feel free to recalculate
<br>
in local currency.) Well first of all, we need to remember
<br>
that a typical engineer works 40 hours a week, or about 20%
<br>
of the time. Secondly, a typical engineer spends a huge
<br>
amount of time communicating (writing and reading design
<br>
documents, looking up reference material etc.) I would say
<br>
that it is an extremely conservative estimate to say that
<br>
the typical engineer spends less than 50% of their work
<br>
time in actual engineering. (Computers do have to perform
<br>
similar tasks, however, the amount of time they take is
<br>
probably negligible.) Also, only a small portion (perhaps
<br>
10%) of the brain is dedicated to the task of conscious
<br>
thought. Also, humans are greatly impaired by the fact the
<br>
their consciousness is essentially serial meaning that they
<br>
cannot perform many engineering tasks in parallel
<br>
(something which engineering strongly lends itself toward.)
<br>
Finally, human engineer’s brains are designed for picking
<br>
berries, and spearing rabbits, not designing computers.
<br>
Consequently, they do not have various specialized hardware
<br>
units that would optimize this task, (such as the ability
<br>
to quickly and accurately do arithmetic, the ability to
<br>
look up databases, the ability to convert abstract concepts
<br>
into manufacturing machine instructions etc.) For these last
<br>
two intangibles, let me assume that the human flop is
<br>
degraded by 50% for each as compared to a computer flop.
<br>
<p>Based on all of this, the average human engineering flop rate
<br>
is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1e14 x 20% x 50% x 10% x 50% x 50% = 2.5e11flop per second.
<br>
<p>An engineer typically costs $80,000 per year (including
<br>
various employment costs). So a human provides
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5e11 flop per sec x 3e7 sec per year / $80,000 = 100e12 flop/$
<br>
<p>You can probably buy a Pentium computer board for about
<br>
$500, giving you approximately 1e9 flop per second.
<br>
Assuming such lasts for 3 years, running continuously, this
<br>
produces
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1e9 flop per sec x 3e7 sec per year x 3 years / $500
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 180e12 flop/$.
<br>
<p>To put this in a different light, 500 1GHz computers cost
<br>
about the same (over a 3 year period) as an engineer, and
<br>
offer more flops for your money.
<br>
<p>This is of course a very approximate calculation, since a
<br>
human flop is only roughly analogous to what a Pentium can
<br>
do in one cycle. However, it surely gives us a general
<br>
order of magnitude. What it tells us is that today, raw
<br>
computer brain power is probably cheaper than human
<br>
engineering brain power, a precondition for the
<br>
singularity.
<br>
<p>Allow me a moment’s idle speculation if you will. Although
<br>
computers have not replaced engineers, it is clear that
<br>
they offer a great deal of leverage to real world
<br>
engineers: I doubt a Pentium designer has though much about
<br>
NAND gates for many years now, never mind transistors.
<br>
Given this, do we see the leading tail of the singularity
<br>
already? Careful observers have noticed that the Moore
<br>
doubling time has been decreasing for some years now, from
<br>
two years, to eighteen months, to its present value of
<br>
around 12 months. I wonder, as I say, if this is the
<br>
start of the singularity?
<br>
<p>However, having said that, I am not convinced that the
<br>
“singularity” will in fact take place over a very short
<br>
period of time as has been widely speculated, because I
<br>
think there is a major flaw in the argument. The argument
<br>
goes something like this: when AI takes over computer
<br>
design we can expect Moore’s law to continue. However, as
<br>
computers become more intelligent (or at least better
<br>
engineers), they will begin to bring about engineering
<br>
changes faster than human engineers. Hence the first Moore
<br>
doubling takes place in two years, but the next takes place
<br>
in half that time, one year, then six months, three months
<br>
and so on, until a singularity is reached at four years.
<br>
<p>The flaw in this argument is that it assumes that design is
<br>
the only cost associated with the production of better
<br>
computers. Design is undoubtedly a dominant cost right now,
<br>
however, as design cost becomes vanishingly small
<br>
other factors begin to take dominance. For example, the
<br>
time necessary to modify the equipment in a plant is small
<br>
in the current scheme, however, when design iterations take
<br>
less than a day, this will become a more significant cost.
<br>
<p>The problem is that under the AI only scenario humans and
<br>
capital are still in the loop, executing the design
<br>
produced by the AI. AI can modify its own code, and can
<br>
undoubtedly make great strides in its productivity that
<br>
way, however the substrate on which the software runs
<br>
provides a maximum speed. Replacing that substrate requires
<br>
human and capital intervention, and it is the regular
<br>
replacement of the substrate (with rapidly diminishing times
<br>
time between replacements) that produces the singularity effect.
<br>
<p>However, should we develop molecular nanotechnology, and
<br>
empower the AI device with that technology, then we can
<br>
eliminate humans and capital completely out of the loop. So, it
<br>
seems then that both AI and MNT are requirements for the
<br>
successful execution of the singularity.
<br>
<p>However, call me a luddite if you like, but the idea of
<br>
giving an AI unrestricted access to MNT is a little
<br>
frightening to me.
<br>
<p>It hardly need be said that the other major problem is that
<br>
our software is so badly lagging behind our hardware, and
<br>
that there are AFAIK so many unsolved problems with AI
<br>
software, that speculating on when human engineer
<br>
replacement AI will be available is a crap shoot.
