</em><br>
<p>In my experience dishonesty is not  a partisan character flaw. I prefer to look
<br>
at individual actions and situations and try to examine them without a
<br>
pre-determined bias. This is more work than a knee-jerk response, but is, alas,
<br>
not as fun.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Do you mean he screwed up his ballot right away because he thought he
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, if he did not pursue charges against the poll worker, thats his
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I suppose it's easier to just insult someone than try to discuss something
<br>
reasonably. What are you afraid of? I'm trying to have an intelligent discussion
<br>
here, and it seems like you would rather attack someone you don't even know (or
<br>
anyone else you deem less intelligent or differently opinioned than youself)
<br>
than court the possibility that your opinion may not be the only one that
<br>
matters. As a matter of clarification, my brother is one of thousands of voters
<br>
who has filed an official complaint (I really don't know the details) over being
<br>
denied his right to vote. As for the ballots, unless you were there and have
<br>
used them yourself, you really have no rational basis for sniping at peoples'
<br>
intelligence or ability to use them. Since he has been voting at the same
<br>
polling place for the last 20 years without any problems, I guess he just
<br>
assumed his voting rights hadn't been undermined. He only noticed something was
<br>
awry when it looked like things weren't lining up properly on the ballot. This
<br>
is when he pointed it out to the poll worker and was basically blown off. I'm
<br>
unclear why you have a problem with this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You are just being a pouty little spoil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sport, like leftists usually are.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you resort to name-calling. This is not only insulting and immature, it
<br>
is useless and a waste of everyone's time. If you are actually interested in
<br>
presenting your point of view rather than just lashing out at imagined enemies,
<br>
this tactic not only weakens your credibility, it totally defuses your own
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p>Since I have never once identified myself as a Democrat or a leftist, I'm not
<br>
sure what reasonable basis you have for making this statement. I have said at
<br>
least one other time that I don't like Gore either, and certainly didn't vote
<br>
for him, so why would I be pouting over him losing the election? My complaint,
<br>
which I stated explicitly, is that the election was not honest because of
<br>
various shenanigans that took place. Just because these under-handed activities
<br>
led to Bush being installed as president is irrelevant to me. Had it been the
<br>
other way around I would feel exactly the same way. My problem is with the
<br>
blatant disregard shown for the American people, and for our democratic rights
<br>
(what little is left of them). It has nothing to do with who won. This is why I
<br>
feel Bush is not legitimately the president, not because I don't like the
<br>
outcome. It seems to me that anyone who actually believes in liberty should have
<br>
a problem with this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Gore has been cheated of the Presidency, but not by Bush. Clinton should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been out of office over a year ago. Its Clinton who cheated Gore of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the job. If Clinton was not such a pathetic president, Gore would likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have won. If Clinton hadn't approved Reno's Elian stormtrooper raid,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gore would have won Florida by a statistically significant margin.
</em><br>
<p>I absolutely agree with you on this, and it is one of the reasons I see no
<br>
significant difference between the two major parties. They both serve special
<br>
interests that have little or no regard for the people, are both corrupt and
<br>
dishonest, and all the empty rhetoric spewed by boths sides won't make a bit of
<br>
difference in the quality of our lives. This is why I am confused why you would
<br>
react in such a way that appears you are favoring the one side over the other.
<br>
Why not toss them both out? I say let's have a politics that is free of such
<br>
narrow and functionally empty dichotomies, one that actually reflects the will
<br>
of the people. Maybe this is naive, and maybe it's impossible to achieve, but it
<br>
seems like something worth working toward.
<br>
<p>just my 2 cents,
<br>
Neal
