Forwarded with permission. This is interesting in the context of our
discussion about keeping track of anti-extropic public figures and
events. I'm building up a &quot;little black book&quot;. :-)&nbsp; One
project I have in mind is to systematically track these folks and have a
process in place for responding to them.<br>

<br>
-- To Members and Friends of the Gerontology Research Group:<br>
<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The
<i>Alliance for Aging Research</i> of Washington, D.C. has just published
<br>
a two-page <b>manifesto</b> in the latest issue of <i>JAAM</i> [*]. Visit
their website at <br>
<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab><x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab><a href="http://www.agingresearch.org/" eudora="autourl">http://www.agingresearch.org</a>
<br>
<br>
and check out their superlative Scientific Advisory Board.&nbsp; Several members were<br>
members of the Wasington, D.C. Gerontology Research Group in 1995-6.<br>
<br>
The article begins with three sad quotations...<br>
<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>... Audrey Chapman, Director of Science and Human Rights at the AAAS said<br>
in <i>US News and World Report, </i>&quot;It is evil to focus energy on trying to live longer than<br>
80 years when many poor people now don't live past age 40.&quot;<br>
<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus of the Institute of Religion and Public Life criticized<br>
what he called &quot;the search for immortality as a <i>pagan</i> and <i>sub-Christian</i> quest driven<br>
by the essentially amoral and mindless dynamic of the <i>technological imperative </i>joined <br>
to an ignoble fear of death.&quot;<br>
<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Dr. Daniel Callahan, Biomedical Ethicist at the Hasting Center in New York said,<br>
in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>, &quot;We can't ban this [longevity] research, but <br>
we can make it socially despicable -- like nuclear testing, we can decide that we don't <br>
want to do it.&nbsp; People at age 65 have lived long enough to experience the typical range <br>
of human possibilities and aspirations: to work, to learn, to love, to procreate, and to <br>
see one's children grow up and become independent adults.&nbsp; No special effort should <br>
be made to help them live longer.&nbsp; In fact, the NIH budget for cancer research should be <br>
reduced.&quot;<br>
<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>We of the LA-GRG believe that we are not only justified but are obligated to do <br>
whatever we can to extend, not shorten, human life.&nbsp; We cannot afford to dismiss these <br>
<i>apologists</i> as harmless.&nbsp; Their titles give them ready access to the media, and they are <br>
capable of stirring irrational fear in society at large (read Congress).&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, they <br>
do pose a threat to the pursuit of medical knowledge that will help millions of people, <br>
including ourselves, live healthy, vital lives, postponing devastating and costly diseases <br>
like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cancer, and Heart Disease, within the period of our own <br>
lifetimes.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
Steve Coles<br>
