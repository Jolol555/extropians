<em>&gt; As someone who makes a living off of Microsoft, I'd like to write a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  There are a LOT of Visual Basic and ASP (Active Server Pages)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers.  I think there's more VB programmers than any   other type in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know.  And it fills me with great sorrow that so many are sorely
<br>
afflicted.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  An awful lot of these programmers make a lot more money once they move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into VB and/or ASP programming from whatever jobs they had in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Does this mean that what they are doing is actually good or that the
<br>
tools are good?  Does it mean it is actually part of the solution to the
<br>
software crisis rather than another part of the problem?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3.  Most (but not all - I'd say about 70-80%) of these folks are not what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most Unix/Linux/Java guys think of as programmers.  Most have no computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science background.  They have no concepts of object oriented programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and for what they're doing, they don't need it.  These guys and gals solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific problems for businesses.  They may not get paid as much as a senior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Java developer, but $45K - $65K is not unheard of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Really scary that so many &quot;business solutions&quot; are being slung together
<br>
by people who are not programmers using tools as weak and Visual Basic. 
<br>
All of us who have had to debug and/or maintain and extend some of these
<br>
&quot;solutions&quot; blanch when we hear such.  A basic data structures and
<br>
algorithms class and a simple introduction to OO is not at all difficult
<br>
to come by and really should be required.  Business that would have
<br>
computer solutions written and deployed by people without at least that
<br>
minimum deserve to have their IT functions come crashing down on their
<br>
head.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  With #3 in mind, it is safe to say that 70-80% of these people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a difficult time getting a &quot;real&quot; programming job and thus might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuck in the dreary, low paying job they had previously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5.  I know this can't be a forgone conclusion, but it seems to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft has created a fantastic opportunity for millions of intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet non-computer science trained people to make much more money than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could if Microsoft didn't exist.  These people contribute greatly to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy, and I think the world is better off with them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Making money and doing good work that actually is a net gain are very
<br>
very different things.  Microsoft has handed loaded computer guns to
<br>
untrained software children.  The 'guns' are so defective they are
<br>
likely to seriously maim the enterprise using them even in the hands of
<br>
highly skilled and trained developers.  But people are making money by
<br>
simply waving them around ok. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Most of the Visual Basic developers that I know are not computer science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained.  Most easily found a job after doing a bit of work at home and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free for others.  Many have no college degrees.  I am aware, though, of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful business projects that are implemented solely with Visual Basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other Microsoft products.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>College degrees as such aren't the criteria.  Knowing the basics of your
<br>
craft is the criteria.  I know many highly degreed CS people that can't
<br>
design and program their way out of the proverbial paper bag.  
<br>
<p>There is certainly a place for tools that don't require full programmer
<br>
talents to use effectively.  But those tools must fit well within the
<br>
larger programming framework.  This requires more openness than MS
<br>
wants.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps I'm an idiot, or a blind sheep following an EVIL company, but by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working for companies which use Microsoft software I am now earning more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than SEVEN times as much money this year than I did in 1995.  My wife, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has no college degree, is making more than $50 an hour doing contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming with Microsoft technologies.  That's money that we're using to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy a new house, have lots of cool toys, and ensure that our son gets the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best private education available in Phoenix, AZ.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>With a bit of training you could be making $200/hr or more consulting. 
<br>
But again, the money is not a valid criteria of the worth of the tools.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know of a LOT of more people with similar stories.  Scott McNealy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Larry Ellison have created no where NEAR the opportunity to achieve this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of success as Bill Gates has - directly or indirectly.  I don't love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft or Bill Gates, but I do respect them for the opportunities they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have given me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Uh, excuse me, but the computer revolution in general with the attendant
<br>
huge demand for software and the dirth of programmers created these high
<br>
paying jobs, NOT Bill Gates.  Bill Gates and MS have fought hard against
<br>
other, arguably much better, tools being as widely used by even novices
<br>
as Visual Basic is today.  Gates and company have sabotaged and killed
<br>
many companies, tools and projects to address the software crises much
<br>
better than these brain-dead MS tools do.
