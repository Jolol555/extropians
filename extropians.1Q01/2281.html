<p>
I wonder who has the best index of words and objects in motion pictures?
<br>
<p>In every frame of every film, there is a collection of objects.  They have
<br>
different properties: shape, color, texture, size, etc.
<br>
<p>If you had a computer that could enumerate the objects in each scene, then
<br>
you could index each movie by it's object set.
<br>
<p>Let's say you knew that a particular electromagnetic phenomena was going to
<br>
occur at a certain time, and you wanted to make sure that a certain set of
<br>
objects was on the most number of television sets at the exact moment of the
<br>
event.
<br>
<p>For example, you want to emphasize &quot;Wooden Bowls&quot;.
<br>
<p>You're superindex of movie frames lists all the movies with wooden bowls in
<br>
the frame.
<br>
<p>You choose just the movies with the right colors and dialog around the bowl.
<br>
<p>You run the movie so that that film moment shows as someone is most likely
<br>
to be channel surfing.
<br>
<p>Who has the best library of film dialog (transcripts with accurate time
<br>
code)?
<br>
<p>Who has movies indexed by musical content?  Not just a soundtrack list, but
<br>
a complete &quot;mood map&quot; of the soundtrack from beginning to end.
<br>
<p>How does one make this information available to netizens for use in &quot;sample&quot;
<br>
based communication.
<br>
<p>A new &quot;barrage of images&quot; based communication format that allows people to
<br>
plot a timeline with a list of symbols and adjectives, then have &quot;the net&quot;
<br>
go find the best media snippets that fit the bill and sequence them in a
<br>
stream to an intended recipient.
