MOST cops (who are shot) are shot during traffic stops.
<br>
Many also get into it as a result of some personal tragedy (crime) 
<br>
which has affected them in some way--wanting to get the people who do 
<br>
things like that off the streets. (What they don't realize is how 
<br>
little they can do in many situations.)

shot at &quot;routine&quot; traffic stops.)
