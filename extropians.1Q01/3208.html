<p>
Looking forward, we see two trends.  The one mentioned in this thread
<br>
is that electronic communications will become more pervasive and
<br>
more difficult for law enforcement to monitor.  The one mentioned in
<br>
another thread is that physical surveillance will become easier and more
<br>
universal.  Let's speculate on the effects if these two trends continue.
<br>
<p>Most physical crimes that we face today would become essentially
<br>
impossible to commit without being caught.  Anything that involves leaving
<br>
your house will put you under serveillance.  You have no expectation
<br>
of privacy in public places and gradually the fields of view of all
<br>
the cameras in the world will become essentially universal.  Robbery,
<br>
assault, murder in all their variations will be performed in public view.
<br>
<p>Some physical crimes might still be possible, if they involve subtle
<br>
manipulations.  You might be able to get away with poisoning someone
<br>
or releasing some deadly virus, without your actions being noticeably
<br>
suspicious.  You might also be able to shoot someone from concealment
<br>
in some cases.  And of course some criminals don't mind being caught,
<br>
or even kill themselves in the act.  But the vast majority of crime
<br>
would be eliminated.
<br>
<p>At the same time, information-based &quot;crimes&quot; would flourish.  It will be
<br>
essentially impossible to keep information from spreading.  This would
<br>
include information piracy of videos, music and books.  It would also
<br>
cover &quot;forbidden&quot; information like how to make bombs, but since you
<br>
can't use the bombs without being caught, that won't matter much.
<br>
<p>Drugs are an interesting case.  On the one hand, drug smuggling and sales
<br>
would be extremely difficult due to physical surveillance.  But on the
<br>
other hand, information about growing and manufacturing drugs would
<br>
be widely available.  We might see a shift towards drugs which can
<br>
be produced and consumed at home.  Drug dealing would no longer be
<br>
big business, but drug use might continue at levels similar to the
<br>
present day.
<br>
<p>One big question is whether this situation would be stable.  There seems
<br>
to be an inherent contradiction in an Orwellian physical world where
<br>
social controls are nearly 100% effective existing beside a libertarian
<br>
virtual world where there are almost no controls whatsoever.
<br>
<p>We might see a desire to extend physical control into the virtual world,
<br>
as with proposals that people submit to surveillance of their online
<br>
activities, use encryption which can be broken by the government, etc.
<br>
In recent years we have been moving away from these proposals, but this
<br>
could change.
<br>
<p>Or, we could see that the libertarian electronic world undermines
<br>
the authoritative physical one, as more of the economy becomes based
<br>
on information.  People would engage in economic transactions which the
<br>
physical world can't monitor, and more importantly, can't tax.  This was
<br>
the original cypherpunk model but it remains to be seen whether this
<br>
could actually work.
<br>
<p>Looking out farther, we have to throw nanotech into the mix, which would
<br>
theoretically expand the range of things you could construct at home using
<br>
just information.  And before that we will be faced with &quot;bathtub biotech&quot;
<br>
which is on the horizon if not here already, allowing people to cook up
<br>
their own biotech cocktails at home using information found on the net.
<br>
<p>How do you feel about this Orwell/libertarian world?  Does the existence
<br>
of virtual freedom compensate for the possibility of increased social
<br>
control outside your home?  And do you think it would be stable, or
<br>
would one side or the other win out?
<br>
