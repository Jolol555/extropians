<p>Depends on your country, of course. The USA seems to run on tips, but
<br>
a normal restaurant tip in the UK is 10% for good service (nothing for
<br>
bad!), and you don't tip taxis, hotel or bar staff, or anyone else unless
<br>
you have a particularly good reason. Note that all these people are on
<br>
salary or hourly wages -- I understand that some American waiters work
<br>
for free (taking their income in tips). 
<br>
<p>In Holland, it's unusual to tip, almost considered an insult; really good
<br>
restaurant service might be worth 5-10%.
<br>
<p>Personally, I find tipping somehow creepy -- patronizing, almost -- and
<br>
on my visits to the US, I found it seemed to encourage really annoying,
<br>
obsequious behaviour by waiters and bar staff. (I don't like waiters
<br>
stopping by every five minutes to ask if everything is alright, if I'm
<br>
having a wonderful meal, and is there anything they can do to improve my
<br>
general happiness! It's intrusive. All I want is to be able to catch their
<br>
eye if I need something, and get reasonably prompt and accurate service.
<br>
For which I'm quite happy to see a 10% surcharge on the bill and avoid
<br>
having to figure out if that's the going rate or not, and to make sure
<br>
I've got the change in my pockets along with my credit card.)
<br>
<p>Of course, tipping on the net is a somewhat difficult beast -- being a
<br>
voluntary donation for use of intellectual property, rather than for a
<br>
personal service. (Usually.)
