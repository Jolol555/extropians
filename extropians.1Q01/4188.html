Cases like this one, if known about more widely, would help the acceptance 
<br>
of stem cell research...

<em>&gt;5-Year-Old Girl's

<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  By Thomas E. Goldstone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Feb. 16 â€” When Kelly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rich turned 1, her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parents Anne and Gordy started to notice she had not reached some of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important milestones that new moms and dads are waiting for. She was late to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crawl, even later to walk, and never was able to speak.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  They grew concerned â€” even more so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when, by the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;she turned 18 months, she was still lagging far behind. So they brought her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the Cleveland Clinic where physicians were stumped, until they noticed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that she was wringing her hands together â€” a possible indication of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little-known neurological disorder, Rett Syndrome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  In 1997, it was confirmed that Kelly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did in fact have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rett Syndrome, a multi-symptomatic disorder causing everything from scoliosis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to seizures, from breathing problems to gastrointestinal trouble. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discriminating disorder, it affects only girls because it is caused by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutation on the X chromosome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &quot;At the time Kelly was diagnosed, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there was no known
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cause and no known cure,&quot; says Gordy. &quot;So we were given this diagnosis which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seemed like a life sentence.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  'Locked Box'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Like Kelly, most girls begin showing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;symptoms between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ages of 6 months and 18 months, seeming to their parents to be in daily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pain and constant mental distress. Maybe worst of all, they are completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unable to communicate; they cannot speak or sign, write or signal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &quot;We knew that there was something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there,&quot; says Gordy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;You could look in her eyes and see that something was going on there. She
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wanted to be with us.&quot; They could see that Kelly wanted to get out of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;locked box&quot; that some twist of fate had put her in. And they were not going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to give up until they set her free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  They turned to the Internet. But there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was not a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to find. Rett syndrome had only been first diagnosed in this country in early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1980s; until then, it was often misdiagnosed as either autism or retardation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even today, many think thousands, if not hundred of thousands of girls
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to be misdiagnosed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  One of the things they did learn on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Internet and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from their doctors was that therapy was a way to help Kelly try to overcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the challenges of living with a brain affected by Rett syndrome. They do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical therapy to keep her muscle tone up and her bones strong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Occupational therapy helps her try to learn the motor skills she lacks, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;music therapy seems to bring an otherwise unseen calm over her.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  The brain of a girl with Rett syndrome 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tightly packed neurons that are firing at double the rate of a normal brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and are firing constantly, never resting like they do in normal brains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Because the neurons in girls with Rett syndrome fire so fast and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ceaselessly, they essentially burnout before the girls are teenagers. After
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their neurons begin to burn out, most girls afflicted with Rett enter a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;period of gradual deterioration that leads to premature death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Hope for a Cure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  The Riches were determined to beat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before it beat them and their daughter, but they were told there was little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treatment beyond therapy. Until, that is, they heard of an amazing discovery
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at Baylor University in Texas. Scientists there isolated the cause of Rett
</em><br>
<em>&gt;syndrome to a defect on the MECP2 gene.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &quot;We were extremely overjoyed that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gene had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;found,&quot; says Gordy. &quot;We were searching for the needle in the haystack. Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we found the needle, we can start to sew. We can fix it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Armed with the knowledge of exactly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutation lies, Dr. Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), thinks his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;company might be able to help Kelly. ACT is focused on what is called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;therapeutic cloning â€” taking one's DNA and using it to grow an embryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clone in order to make what are essentially &quot;spare parts&quot; that can replaced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damaged ones. Lanza says that diseases like diabetes or Alzheimer's might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easier than Rett syndrome to fix using these therapeutic cloning methods, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he holds out hope that ACT will someday be able to help Kelly and her fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rett patients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Banking on a Clone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Simplified, the process â€” which is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research phase â€” might work something like this in Kelly's case: using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sophisticated gene therapy techniques, Kelly's mutated DNA would be &quot;fixed,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essentially removing the mutations that causes Rett. The &quot;fixed&quot; DNA would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then be put into a de-nucleated donor egg, where the original DNA has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;removed. This egg would then be coaxed into dividing as if it were an egg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that had been fertilized by a sperm to then be the beginning of a new human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life. What it is at this point is a embryonic clone of Kelly, but this time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without Rett syndrome. The cells in this days-old clone are called stem cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and they have the miraculous potential to turn into anything. In the lab, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists at ACT would hope to be able to turn these stem cells into new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neurons that could replace the defective neurons in Kelly's brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  It sounds like science fiction, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for their little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;girl's sake the Riches are banking, literally, that it becomes &quot;science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact.&quot; Gordy sold a business and invested the money in ACT and the Rett
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Syndrome Research Foundation, which he started to fund researchers doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biomedical work on the disorder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  He knows, however, that he is racing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clock. &quot;I think we have a 5 to 7 year window, so we are doing everything we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibly can to fund as much research, to get as many researchers involved so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that in this window, hopefully some cure will be found,&quot; says Gordy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &quot;When I look in her eyes,&quot; he says of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his 5-year-old,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I see a person and I want to be able to communicate with her. I want her to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say 'Goodnight Daddy.'&quot;
