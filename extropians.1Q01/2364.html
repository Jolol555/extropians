<p><em>&gt; Do only relatively dumb and docile humans get taxed now?  Can

<p>As a matter of fact, more real-world intelligent and
<br>
powerful people and entities pay less taxes (at least 
<br>
according to IRS statistics), unless the choose not to 
<br>
take countermeasures. A fair number of them may  not 
<br>
pay taxes at all (these are below (or, rather, above) 
<br>
IRS' radar horizont). For instance, Microsoft is
<br>
effectively tax-exempt (the poor blighters).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a human-like AI of a distinctly &gt;H intelligence (they'd
</em><br>
max out Hamburger-Wechsler without even trying) we're dumb
<br>
protohominids with a hostile intention: fork over some of your
<br>
output, in currency of validity to us, or we'll shut you
<br>
down (since, of what sense is it asking for taxes, if
<br>
you can't punish the defector?). As an AI, I'd first made 
<br>
sure that no one can shut me down, period. The probability
<br>
of containment breach would depend on the intelligence level
<br>
and the time available for planning. Then I'd cheerfully 
<br>
ignore any attempts of enforcement at best, or nuke the 
<br>
annoying critters disturbing my circles at worst.
<br>
<p>I do not believe in super-docile AIs. The AI we can build
<br>
and control is next to useless (good for sorting trash, 
<br>
delivering goods, keeping the house tidy and driving a car), 
<br>
and a useful AI is uncontrollable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; corporations avoid taxes by being non-localized?  A guy could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hide in the woods after all, and then how would you tax him?
</em><br>
<p>As people in presence of &gt;H AIs, we're really, really small
<br>
beer. We should be really thankful if AIs would want to tax us,
<br>
because that would presume that we could create something of
<br>
value to them, and not being a liability instead of asset.
<br>
I do not see how. To an &gt;&gt;H AI (developmentally but not
<br>
temporally distant) a human has got about the complexity 
<br>
of a pencil doodle, or maybe a calculator, and as easily 
<br>
created or erased.
<br>
<p>This not to diss humans, merely to put things in the perspective.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If a world has many AIs, some of them will be available to devise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and enforce taxes, if the powers that be then want taxes devised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and enforced.  If AIs sell their services in public markets, then
</em><br>
<p>Taxes, schmaxes. Who taxes whom in an ecosystem?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; sales taxes could be used.  If they own visible property, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property taxes could be used.
</em><br>
<p>How is an animal in a forest taxed? Which property does it own?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course if the powers that be don't want AIs to be taxed, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be taxed.  But that is a question of desire, not ability.
</em><br>
<p>The Powers are the AIs. Since I don't see a mechanism by which
<br>
we should be able to keep up with the super-joneses, and I do not 
<br>
see any incentive on the part of AIs (until they're constructed 
<br>
very, very carefully from human biological template -- which is
<br>
about the most complicated and expensive way to build an AI, so
<br>
most likely a different, easier but more dangerous path will be
<br>
taken), the AIs are the sole players on the field. As soon as 
<br>
they arrive, we become a part of the environment, to be manipulated 
<br>
at will. 
<br>
<p>This is not a nice state to be in, so I suggest we handle
<br>
this dangerous transition period with extreme care.
