<p>
As someone who makes a living off of Microsoft, I'd like to write a few
<br>
things:
<br>
<p>1.  There are a LOT of Visual Basic and ASP (Active Server Pages)
<br>
programmers.  I think there's more VB programmers than any   other type in
<br>
the world.
<br>
<p>2.  An awful lot of these programmers make a lot more money once they move
<br>
into VB and/or ASP programming from whatever jobs they had in the past.
<br>
<p>3.  Most (but not all - I'd say about 70-80%) of these folks are not what
<br>
most Unix/Linux/Java guys think of as programmers.  Most have no computer
<br>
science background.  They have no concepts of object oriented programming
<br>
and for what they're doing, they don't need it.  These guys and gals solve
<br>
specific problems for businesses.  They may not get paid as much as a senior
<br>
Java developer, but $45K - $65K is not unheard of.
<br>
<p>4.  With #3 in mind, it is safe to say that 70-80% of these people would
<br>
have a difficult time getting a &quot;real&quot; programming job and thus might be
<br>
stuck in the dreary, low paying job they had previously.
<br>
<p>5.  I know this can't be a forgone conclusion, but it seems to me that
<br>
Microsoft has created a fantastic opportunity for millions of intelligent,
<br>
yet non-computer science trained people to make much more money than they
<br>
could if Microsoft didn't exist.  These people contribute greatly to the
<br>
economy, and I think the world is better off with them.
<br>
<p>Most of the Visual Basic developers that I know are not computer science
<br>
trained.  Most easily found a job after doing a bit of work at home and for
<br>
free for others.  Many have no college degrees.  I am aware, though, of many
<br>
successful business projects that are implemented solely with Visual Basic
<br>
and other Microsoft products.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I'm an idiot, or a blind sheep following an EVIL company, but by
<br>
working for companies which use Microsoft software I am now earning more
<br>
than SEVEN times as much money this year than I did in 1995.  My wife, who
<br>
has no college degree, is making more than $50 an hour doing contract
<br>
programming with Microsoft technologies.  That's money that we're using to
<br>
buy a new house, have lots of cool toys, and ensure that our son gets the
<br>
best private education available in Phoenix, AZ.
<br>
<p>I know of a LOT of more people with similar stories.  Scott McNealy and
<br>
Larry Ellison have created no where NEAR the opportunity to achieve this
<br>
level of success as Bill Gates has - directly or indirectly.  I don't love
<br>
Microsoft or Bill Gates, but I do respect them for the opportunities they
<br>
have given me.

<em>&gt; &gt;Most people would agree with you.  I personally don't have
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;knee-jerk animosity towards Microsoft.  However as a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;many different levels.  Unless you write software though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you aren't likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to see or understand these strong objections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is true.  Microsoft plays dirty tricks to sabotage the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition.  Most people will not have debugged Microsoft's stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to figure out what is going on inside.  Not to start an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-Microsoft discussion, but here are some examples:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - font smoother in Windows serves smooth fonts to Internet Explorer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and jagged fonts to Netscape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - server serves Internet Explorer first but delays serving Netscape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - server refuses to give Netscape common gif or jpeg formats, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serves an error message that Netscape can't display these images but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet Explorer can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - takes control of Novell printer and then when finished, gives it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other Windows systems first, delaying the Novell printer queue until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all windows systems are done printing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - writes invalid HTML code that fails to work in other browsers, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extends Internet Explorer to read the invalid code so it works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - bought Apple technology to create Windows, and then claimed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Windows 3.0 was not the same Windows they built with Apple source code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - promised IBM Windows technology for OS/2 including all future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of Windows, but then claimed Windows 95 was not the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Windows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - used open-source Kerberos source code while promising the open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source foundation they will publish their source code, then published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source code but only to people who sign an agreement not to compete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Microsoft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - set cheap prices for servers as long as they did not support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Netscape or link to Netscape's site, those that did had to pay much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher prices *retroactively* as a punishment for supporting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - put delays in Excel for Macintosh so it would run slower than Excel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Windows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - gives developers degraded system calls while their internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software developers use better system calls so competitor software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can never work as fast or as well as Microsoft products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Java deliberately breaks security rules so that they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add more features
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Java deliberately checked platform so that it would act differently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Windows than other systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - signed agreement  not to change the Java syntax one bit, but then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used tricks to act differently with the same syntax such that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same command would act different for different systems or situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people who dislike Microsoft do so because they support open and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair competition.  The way to win in the market should be to build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better product, not sabotage a competitor's product.  Sometimes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems that Microsoft puts more work into sabotaging other products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than making their product better.
