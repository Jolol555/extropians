<p>This will increasingly not hold up as citizens become more cyborgish.
<br>
There is little difference recording something in your head for your own
<br>
use where you can't prove there weren't areas and can't easily share it
<br>
or perfectly recall it and using better tech that you can perfectly
<br>
replay (more or less) and share.  Are the courts going to effectively
<br>
insist on lobotomizing cyber-intensive citizens?  This is bogus.
