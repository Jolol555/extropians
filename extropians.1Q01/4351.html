<p>
I can't sort out the sarcasm from the real intention in this thread, but I 
<br>
think there's a very important point about &quot;human nature&quot; in the subject 
<br>
matter under discussion.  Throughout much of the 20th Century, cultural 
<br>
anthropology fell under the sway of an ideology that insisted that there 
<br>
really wasn't a thing called &quot;human nature&quot;.  Margaret Meade's infamous 
<br>
intellectual fraud in &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; is just the most acute example 
<br>
of how this ideology rode roughshod over empiricism.  We are just now seeing 
<br>
the beginnings of a return to the idea of truly scientific endeavor of 
<br>
cultural anthropology.  As a result, I find just about any argument based on 
<br>
the field work of cultural anthropologists during the last 70 years to be 
<br>
suspect.
<br>
<p>With that said, study of the &quot;nature&quot; of human sexuality is, I think, still 
<br>
very much in its infancy.  Sorting out the &quot;IS&quot; from the &quot;OUGHT&quot; is an 
<br>
important first step, and one that is exceedingly difficult in these days of 
<br>
ideologically-charged &quot;gender politics&quot; in the West and elsewhere.  Further, 
<br>
distinguishing between the drives engendered by our hormones and evolutionary 
<br>
imperatives on the one hand and how we ought to behave to satisfy other goals 
<br>
or values on the other hand can be a tricky undertaking.  I suspect that much 
<br>
of the &quot;free love&quot; sentiment of the 60s derives from such confusion.  After 
<br>
all, condemning monogamy as &quot;a custom built by the local religious death 
<br>
cult's priesthood against having fun with your body&quot; certainly seems like it 
<br>
ought to make getting laid by a wide variety of sex partners easier 
<br>
(especially when such sentiments are espoused by a hipster anthropology 
<br>
professor in a class full of nubile young co-eds).
<br>
<p>Don't mistake what I've written above as some sort of reactionary apology for 
<br>
cultural conservatism.  Far from it.  Instead, I'm simply encouraging a 
<br>
healthy skepticism about how we think about human sexuality and questions of 
<br>
reproductive behavior.
