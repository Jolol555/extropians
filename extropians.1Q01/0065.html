<p><em>&gt;I was thinking about qualia - wondering what would happen if my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain were suddenly receiving inputs about other wavelengths of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;light besides those in the visible range, x-rays suppose - would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I immediately associate novel colors with them, or it would take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some time to learn? I realized that since I have (at least)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;red/green color blindness I may get to find out sooner then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;normal, since a treatment for color blindness will probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed before x-ray vision. I was curious how serious my color
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blindness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually was - so far in 23 years I haven't really had much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficulty with it. So I looked up &quot;color blindness&quot; and found
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this page among others:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/8833/coloreye.html">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/8833/coloreye.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It has a chart on it, and I was startled to find that I can pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only one of the six tests with no difficulty. Three more of them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can sort-of discern some difference in color around the center..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does anyone know if there is any work being done in treatment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;color blindness? I would suspect it's more advanced then anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going on today since they'd need to implant cones and rods in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eye, or make them grow there. Any ideas on how to even come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a treatment? Finding out my deficiency was so serious is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;great feeling. It means when I fix it, it'll be a whole new world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of experience.
</em><br>
<p>There are some patents out there for special lenses to assist those
<br>
with various color deficiencies. I became very interested in this
<br>
after the recent list discussion on tetrachromatics. (I have normal
<br>
color vision)
<br>
<p>I have sent some information and a signed OSA to a large
<br>
manufacturer of high quality optical wear. (Oakley) Along with
<br>
attempting to get them to manufacture tetrachromatic lenses for the
<br>
rest of us, I hope to interest them in special glasses for those
<br>
who have color deficiencies.
<br>
<p>In the mean time you are in good company. A recent return e-mail
<br>
from Sir Arthur C Clarke confirmed he has red-green deficiencies.
