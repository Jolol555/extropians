Since I also grew up and live in a rural environment, I don't have a
<br>
problem with redneck/white trash jokes in the least, so long as they
<br>
remain in the realm of jokes and are not used in what should be serious
<br>
discussion to denigrate opposing views, a problem which should be
<br>
considered wrong and bad debating no matter what side starts it. For
<br>
example, the constant use of denigrating redneck stereotypes by anti-g_n
<br>
debaters to belittle their opponents.
