<p>**Actually, quantum theory sounds a whole lot kookier than Velikovsky-
<br>
-but it does seem to be correct. And I refuse to discount a theory 
<br>
based upon the opinion and characterizations of an individual who has 
<br>
examined said theory for a total of 4.3 seconds.

<p><p><em>&gt;      &gt;You, on the  other hand, have studied the matter carefully,

I'm sure.

<em>&gt; Yes, I've studied Velikovsky, I can say with confidence  that I've 
</em><br>
given the man all the time he
<br>

<p>**'Tis what I thought--an unbiased scientific examination of the 
<br>
man's entire body of work, yah?
<br>
<p>*&quot;I have already carefully read the first volume of the memoirs to 
<br>
“Worlds in Collision,” and have supplied it with a few marginal notes

<br>
Immanuel Velikovsky, March 17, 1955 
<br>
**Apparently Mr. Einstein thought the matter warranted a wee bit more 
<br>
than 4.3 seconds of &quot;his&quot; time--though it must be said that he did 
<br>
not support the Venus contention, and found parts of V's works to be 
<br>
fanciful, as of 1954-55.
<br>
<p>**But I guess you're busy working out that Unified Field Theory that 
<br>
E found so pesky.

<p><p>&nbsp;Neutrality on stupidity of this colossal magnitude is

<p>**The neutrality I disagree with--but I'm with you on the stupidity.
