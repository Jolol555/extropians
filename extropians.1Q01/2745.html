some have speculated, &quot;free basics&quot; might come with some strings attached,

such as built-in advertising, or as a give-away in connection with some other

Maybe there's more, but I think this would do it very well. I would like to

self-maintaining technology. I speculate the world would be a better place.

<p>I'm writing my thoughts as I think them here, so please forgive me if this 
<br>
post isn't coherent and elegant. If I'd waited to post this until I'd 
<br>
thought everything through, the thread would have been long-past, so I'm 
<br>
taking the risk of sounding silly in the hopes that we can keep an 
<br>
interesting discussion going.
<br>
<p>I've been looking at the guaranteed income from a new perspective since 
<br>
reading Chapter 7 of THE SPIKE.
<br>
<p>The main reason I can think of for not having a government-provided 
<br>
guaranteed income is that it is morally wrong for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one group of people calling themselves &quot;the government&quot; to steal from 
<br>
another group of people, regardless of how the thieves dispose of the 
<br>
stolen goods. A guaranteed income would seem to require that this sort of 
<br>
theft be perpetrated.
<br>
<p>[Damien writes: &quot;...society will pay everyone, as an inalienable right, a 
<br>
basic minimum dividend drawn from the productivity and wealth of the 
<br>
nation.&quot;--the problem with this is that society is made up of individuals. 
<br>
Productivity and wealth don't appear unattached to human effort. In order 
<br>
to &quot;draw&quot; them and make them available for distribution, one must first 
<br>
take them from the individuals who produced them--this is the libertarian 
<br>
argument, and it's valid, I think, to the extent that current distribution 
<br>
of wealth reflects a morally justifiable process]
<br>
<p>Thus, it would seem that in order to justify a guaranteed income,  the 
<br>
contributions to the &quot;community pot&quot; would have to be made voluntarily; or 
<br>
one would have to show that the recipients of guaranteed payments have a 
<br>
morally justifiable claim to such payments.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chapter 7 of THE SPIKE Damien mentions, in passing, the concept of the 
<br>
guaranteed income as an inheritance. [&quot;...let's not look at a guaranteed 
<br>
income as a 'natural right,' like the supposed innate rights to freedom of 
<br>
speech and liberty. Rather it is an inheritance, something *owed* to all 
<br>
the children of a society whose ancestors for generations have together 
<br>
built, and purchased through the work of their minds and hands, the 
<br>
resource base sustaining today's cornucopia.&quot;]  I like this idea a lot, and 
<br>
it ties into the discussion we were recently having about &quot;human nature.&quot;
<br>
<p>For all the years of the existence of  *Homo sapiens sapiens* other than 
<br>
the tiniest fraction representing the last 10,000 years or so, members of 
<br>
the species lived in relatively small groups. Based on the available 
<br>
evidence, up until the start of agriculture, a typical human could expect a 
<br>
guaranteed income something like what Denis listed (excepting, maybe, 
<br>
unrestricted access to information--but one's access to information would 
<br>
not be restricted according to the amount of material wealth one produced). 
<br>
The scientific discoveries which have most changed our lives were 
<br>
apparently made by people living under these conditions (domestication of 
<br>
crops and animals, for example--all the major food crops and animals were 
<br>
domesticated during this period).
<br>
<p>The problem with having a guaranteed income administered by a centralized 
<br>
government with power over a large number of people inhabiting a large 
<br>
geographical area is the lack of personal interaction between donors and 
<br>
recipients. These sorts of systems always seem to cave in on themselves 
<br>
through mismanagement and corruption.
<br>
<p>But our present system isn't working very well either. Not for the vast 
<br>
majority of people living within it. Most people spend the majority of 
<br>
their time doing things they don't want to be doing. For most people, life 
<br>
cannot be said to be joyful. One reason for this seems to be the 
<br>
association of having a job with being a respectable person. The problem 
<br>
with this is that a huge portion of the &quot;work&quot; done each day is bullshit 
<br>
&quot;busy work.&quot;  An example of busy work in school: my daughter and I used to 
<br>
spend a certain part of each year traveling, and I'd get the lesson plans 
<br>
from the teachers so she could keep up with her class at school. We'd 
<br>
always finish a day's work in an hour and a half or less. I understand that 
<br>
something like 80% of the productive work in business organizations is done 
<br>
in 20% of the time. The other 80% of the time is spent non productively (if 
<br>
productivity is measured in terms of advancing toward a desirable goal). I 
<br>
think much of what people do these days is motivated by a need to stay 
<br>
busy. Work is invented.
<br>
<p>Another quote from THE SPIKE: &quot;In a world mutating ever more swiftly under 
<br>
the impact of high technology, detestable toil will be very hard to find, 
<br>
or even invent.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'd never heard of Robert Theobald until I read THE SPIKE and was overjoyed 
<br>
to discover his work. At the link below you can read, in book form, a 
<br>
series of lectures he prepared shortly before his death in 1999.
<br>
<p>Theobald says:
<br>
<p>&quot;My experience shows that people ready for new opportunities. Think about 
<br>
how avalanches start. When conditions are ripe, the immediate cause can be 
<br>
very minor. The same is true for cultural shifts. The real challenge today 
<br>
is learn how to act as though what we do can make a difference. As the 
<br>
anthropologist Margaret Mead said: 'Never doubt that a small group of 
<br>
committed people can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing which 
<br>
ever has'.&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.transform.org/transform/tlc/rschap1a.html">http://www.transform.org/transform/tlc/rschap1a.html</a>
<br>
<p>I'd like to begin a discussion here and now about changing the social 
<br>
structures of the world. Rather than falling into the abyss of pigeon 
<br>
holing and name calling, I'd like to begin by looking for common ground. 
<br>
What sort of lives do we want to live? If we were writing the scripts for 
<br>
our own lives, including he sort of society we'll live in, what would we write?
<br>
<p>Here's a quote from one of Theobald's lectures:
<br>
<p>&quot;A new image may help us to grasp the ways we shall need to behave in the 
<br>
future. Herman Daly, an economist who challenges the growth ethic, has 
<br>
suggested that our present economic system is like a jet plane that must 
<br>
fly at high speed, because otherwise it will stall and crash. He suggested 
<br>
that we should start to think about a helicopter which could hover. 
<br>
However, a helicopter is both fuel-inefficient and noisy. I propose that we 
<br>
start thinking about a glider as our symbol for the future. I recognize the 
<br>
danger of pushing any analogy too far but there are some fascinating 
<br>
thoughts which emerge as one considers the operation of a glider.
<br>
<p>&quot;First, any activity will inevitably use up resources at its beginning. The 
<br>
appropriate questions are first, what is the minimum effective amount of 
<br>
resources needed to accomplish the purpose, and second, whether the gain 
<br>
will compensate for the expenditure of energy.
<br>
Second, just as an experienced pilot can find a thermal when the less 
<br>
skilled may miss it, an individual who knows how to carry through an 
<br>
activity has a far greater chance of succeeding than the uninformed.
<br>
<p>&quot;Third, the glider is brilliantly designed for its purpose. The 
<br>
post-industrial world will not have the resources to tolerate the 
<br>
overdesign and waste which is so common today. Overcoming problems by brute 
<br>
force, rather than by using imagination and knowledge, will not be 
<br>
acceptable in the future.
<br>
<p>&quot;Finally, the image of the glider reminds us that nothing lasts forever: 
<br>
The craft eventually comes back to earth regardless of the skill of the 
<br>
pilot. We urgently need to relearn that just as we are afraid of personal 
<br>
death, we are also profoundly unwilling to recognize that institutions can 
<br>
long outlive their usefulness. Huge amounts of waste are tolerated as we 
<br>
prop up obsolete profit, non-profit, and governmental institutions.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'd like to emphasize a sentence from the above:
<br>
<p>&quot;Overcoming problems by brute force, rather than by using imagination and 
<br>
knowledge, will not be acceptable in the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>In evaluating the various technologies that are currently following 
<br>
exponential development paths, it seems a good idea to sort out the brute 
<br>
force ones from the elegant ones.
<br>
<p>I gotta go now, because the sun is shining brightly and the breeze smells 
<br>
of  newly emerging cotyledons in the garden. I'd love to continue this 
<br>
discussion if anyone's interested.
