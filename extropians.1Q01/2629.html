<em>&gt; &gt;Russell forwards a column by James C. Bennett:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  In California, some dim bulb (so to speak) had the amazing concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  deregulating the prices power companies would have to pay to power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  suppliers for their power, without deregulating the price at which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; could sell power to consumers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From what I've read about the crisis, this is not why the price freeze was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;put into place.  It was actually done to benefit the utility companies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to guarantee them profits.  At the time of deregulation wholesale prices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;had been low for decades, and the reason for deregulation was to bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;down retail prices, which had remained stubbornly high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with your analysis, as far as I can tell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What confuses me about this crisis is all the blame on NIMBYs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental laws for causing the problem.  The talk of opening up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alaska and Florida oil drilling also confuses me.  Although these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be worthy issues to discuss, they have nothing to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current crisis.  The problem is not being caused by a shortage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power plants (caused by NIMBYs) or lack or oil (caused by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental restrictions on drilling).  The problem is a shortage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of money.  The power is there, but nobody will pay for it.  End-user
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices don't cover the cost of the electricity.  The utilities are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bankrupt so they can't pay.
</em><br>
<p>No, Harvey. California is in a power deficit. It must import power from
<br>
other regions. There are few, if any, areas of the US that are now in a
<br>
power surplus. We are importing lots of power from Canada and Mexico at
<br>
huge rates, and there is an ongoing legal battle between Vermont
<br>
utilities and Hydro-Quebec over contracted pricing. The Vermont
<br>
Utilities Board has been trying to prevent rate hikes to reflect actual
<br>
costs, while at the same time refusing to let the Vermont Yankee nuke
<br>
plant be sold for the lower amount that was offered, they want it sold
<br>
at auction to a utility that will pay more for it with bond money that
<br>
must be paid back with higher rates. Because state utility boards are
<br>
under seige from green and PIRG interest groups mobilizing NIMBY'd
<br>
people, local new power generation is being built at a lower rate than
<br>
at any time in the last 50 years while demand growth is growing faster
<br>
than at almost any time. California is simply the opening battle in what
<br>
will be a continent wide crisis that will blow up in the next 1-3 years.
<br>
By next fall weekly outages will be commonplace across the country.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The California utilities had their power cut off because they failed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay their last bill.  Utilities in other states who can still pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for power are still getting it.  When President Bush ordered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other states to not cut off power, the power came back on.  There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no lack of power.  There is a lack of solvent utility companies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no question about how to get the power back on.  The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is who is going to pay for it.
