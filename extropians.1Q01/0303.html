Wisdom From Senior Citizens
<br>
<p>1. I started with nothing. I still have most of it.
<br>
2. When did my wild oats turn to prunes and all bran?
<br>
3. I finally got my head together, now my body is falling apart.
<br>
4. Funny, I don't remember being absent minded.
<br>
5. All reports are in. Life is now officialy unfair.
<br>
6. If all is not lost, where is it?
<br>
7. It is easier to get older than it is to get wiser.
<br>
8. If at first you do succeed, try not to look astonished.
<br>
9. The first rule of holes: if you are in one, stop digging.
<br>
10. I tried to get a life once, but they told me they were out of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stock.
<br>
11. I went to school to become a wit, only got halfway through.
<br>
12. It was so different before everything changed.
<br>
13. Some days you're the dog, and some days you're the hydrant.
<br>
14. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.
<br>
15. I wish the buck stopped here! I could use a few.
<br>
16. Kids in the back seat cause accidents; accidents in the back seat
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause kids.
<br>
17. It's not the pace of life that concerns me, it's the sudden stop
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the end.
<br>
18. It's hard to make a comeback when you haven't been anywhere.
<br>
19. Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a trip around
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun.
<br>
20. The only time the world beats a path to your door is if you're in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bathroom.
<br>
21. If God wanted me to touch my toes, He would have put them on my
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knees.
<br>
22. Never knock on death's door, ring the bell and run. (he hates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that.)
<br>
23. Lead me not into temptation (I can find the way myself)
<br>
24. When you are finally holding all the cards, why does everyone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else decide to play chess?
<br>
25. If you're living on the edge, make sure you're wearing your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seatbelt.
<br>
26. There are two kinds of pedestrians. The quick &amp; the dead.
<br>
27. An unbreakable toy is useful for breaking other toys.
<br>
28. A closed mouth gathers no feet.
<br>
29. Health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.
<br>
30. It's not hard to meet expenses; they're everywhere.
<br>
31. Jury: Twelve people who determine which client has the better
<br>
attorney.
<br>
32. The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth.
