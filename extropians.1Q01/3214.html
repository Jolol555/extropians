<em>&gt; Spike Jones&gt;The only good thing I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;can think of to come out of all this is that the general public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will be given a valuable lesson in economics and the advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of free markets over government rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [zeb haradon doesnt] think so. Just look at all the editorials and headlines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream papers read by most people). It generally goes like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;deregulation has failed&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>True, zeb, but our education isnt over yet.  Taxifornia is far from
<br>
graduating from the university of re-regulation.  That adventure is
<br>
gonna fail far worse.  Keep watching.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most people don't have the time or inclination to look into exactly what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies the &quot;deregulation&quot; specifically refers to
</em><br>
<p>But they will.  Probably by candle light.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The lesson most people will learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from this is that &quot;deregulation doesn't work...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;...but it works a lot better than attempted re-regulation.&quot;  It cannot
<br>
stop here, for as long as power prices are held artificially low,
<br>
there is no consumer motivation to conserve, nor any compelling
<br>
reason to invest in energy-smart appliances.  Any attempts at
<br>
re-regulation must also include attempts at legislating consumption,
<br>
and we can scarcely imagine what a morass that will lead to.
<br>
<p>For instance, right now they are hitting the car dealerships, but
<br>
what if they can show that they use less power than the cable TV
<br>
company?  Then what if it gets worse and they start putting caps
<br>
on how much power a household can use?  Two persons live in
<br>
my house, with an occasional guest.  Just down the street I can show
<br>
you a house just like mine where 17 people are living.  Do they
<br>
get an extra allowance?  If so, when I have a bunch of guests do
<br>
I get an extra allowance?  How long must they stay?  What if I
<br>
use a bunch of power this month, then run off a generator for
<br>
a while?  You can see the slow motion train-wreck the so-called
<br>
governor is leading us to.
<br>
<p>Continued regulation wouldnt have worked either.  If you hold
<br>
prices down artificially, demand goes up until ya run out.  Universal
<br>
truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whenever anyone talks about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementing &quot;deregulation&quot;, the inevitable response will be &quot;don't you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember what happened with electricity when we tried that?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Then we show that deregulation *has* worked in other states.
<br>
It is partial deregulation that doesnt work.
