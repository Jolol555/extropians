<em>&gt; Well, I'm afraid I can't -- my copy of the book seems to be lent out.
</em><br>
<p>I repurchased the book in paperback this weekend (Moravec's
<br>
_Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind_ [not _....Being_ as
<br>
I had it]), so I can supply the quotes I was thinking of.
<br>
<p>They're in Chapter 5, &quot;The Age of Robots&quot;, in the section
<br>
&quot;The Long Run (2100 and Beyond)&quot; beginning on p. 143:
<br>
&quot;The garden of earthly delights will be reserved for the meek,
<br>
and those who would eat of the tree of knowledge must be banished.&quot;
<br>
<p>p. 144:  &quot;Residents of the solar system's wild frontier will be shaped
<br>
by conditions very different from tame Earth's...  Like wilderness
<br>
explorers of the past, far from civilization, they must rely on
<br>
their own resourcefulness...  Ex-humans, from the start, will
<br>
be free of any mandatory laws.&quot;
<br>
<p>p. 145:  &quot;An ecology will arise, as individual Exes specialize.
<br>
Some may choose to defend territory in the solar system...  Others
<br>
may decide to push on to the nearby stars...  There will be
<br>
conflicts of interest and occasional clashes that drive away or
<br>
destroy some of the participants.  Superintelligent foresight
<br>
and flexibility should allow most conflicts to be settled by
<br>
mutually beneficial surrenders, compromises, joint ventures,
<br>
or mergers.  Small entities may be absorbed by larger ones...
<br>
Parasites, in hardware and software, many starting out as
<br>
component parts of larger beings, will evolve to exploit the
<br>
rich ecology.  The scene may resemble the free-for-all revealed
<br>
in microscopic peeks at pond water.  Instead of bacteria
<br>
and rotifers, the players will be entities of potentially
<br>
planetary size...  An entity that fails to keep up with its
<br>
neighbors is likely to be **eaten**, its space, materials,
<br>
energy, and useful thoughts reorganized to serve another's
<br>
goals.  Such a fate may be routine for humans who dally too
<br>
long on slow Earth before going Ex.&quot;
<br>
<p>p. 146:  &quot;Some ex-humans may invest their severance pay in fast
<br>
starships, to dash off in an unexpected direction into the
<br>
vastness beyond the solar system's dangers, morsels too tiny
<br>
to be worth pursuit.  They will be like newly hatched marine
<br>
turtles scrambling across a beach to the sea, under greedy
<br>
swooping birds [Hah!  When I alluded earlier to Tennessee
<br>
Williams' _Suddenly Last Summer_, I had no conscious
<br>
recollection of this line in Moravec! :-&gt;].  Others may
<br>
prenegotiate favorable absorption terms with established Exes,
<br>
like graduating seniors meeting company recruiters, or Faust
<br>
soliciting bids for his soul from competing devils.&quot;
<br>
<p>In a sense, I suppose, this is just business as usual for
<br>
anyone deeply acculturated to the Darwinian view of life.  I guess
<br>
that most serious Darwinians are professional biologists; the rest
<br>
of us mostly take pains to **avoid** having to think about these
<br>
unpleasant realities.  Also, I suppose that if your self-confidence
<br>
is such that you think of yourself as Atlas who shrugged
<br>
for Ayn Rand, then of course you expect to be among the survivors of
<br>
the earliest transcendents, running the show.  However, for
<br>
those whose serotonin levels are pitched to a lower key, the
<br>
thought of being &quot;absorbed&quot; must be at least a disquieting as
<br>
the prospect of taking a new job with a really nasty
<br>
consulting company :-&gt;
<br>
<p>Oh yes, and Moravec also adds (in the section &quot;Coddling Earth&quot;
<br>
on p. 154):  &quot;The genteel earthling lifestyle cannot last
<br>
forever.  Sooner or later something in the exponentially
<br>
developing Ex ecology will come back to bite.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cheers.
<br>
