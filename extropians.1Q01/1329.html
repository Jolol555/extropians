<em>&gt; So, your question for $64K: why is Extropianism so overtly associated

</em><br>
<p>I don't think anyone could accuse me of being purely optimistic.  I take
<br>
pride in pointing out an ominous cloud of doom whenever I'm the first to
<br>
spot it.  Am I to be condemned solely because I think that there exists a
<br>
significant chance that humanity will make it through this okay?  I
<br>
certainly don't think that anyone could accuse me of encouraging a
<br>
passive, lay-back-and-wait-for-the-Singularity attitude.
<br>
<p>And all that said, I would have to say that the reason some reporters
<br>
casually designate Extropianism as a &quot;cult&quot; or a &quot;sect&quot; is that they have
<br>
utterly failed to do their homework.  All they know is that we like
<br>
technology and that Max More lives in California.  I see no reason to
<br>
become defensive about it.  Annoyed, yes, and more annoyed with each
<br>
repetition - but not defensive, any more than quantum computing theorists
<br>
become defensive when yet another reporter writes that quantum computers
<br>
are more powerful &quot;because each qubit can contain a 1 and a 0 at the same
<br>
time&quot;.  Extropianism is not in the class of things that could be called a
<br>
&quot;cult&quot; - an &quot;ideology&quot; perhaps, but not a &quot;cult&quot;.  Calling Extropianism a
<br>
cult is like calling the ACM a nationwide conspiracy or calling Worldcon a
<br>
right-wing survivalist camp.
