</em><br>
<p>I haven't read THE CLOCK OF THE LONG NOW, but I'm familiar with some of 
<br>
Brand's earlier work, which might shed some light on the question of his 
<br>
attitude towards human life in general (IMO the world would be a more 
<br>
pleasant place to live if more architects, landscape designers, and city 
<br>
planners would study his book HOW BUILDINGS LEARN: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 
<br>
THEY'RE BUILT along with Alexander's THE TIMELESS WAY OF BUILDING and A 
<br>
PATTERN LANGUAGE).
<br>
<p>One of my favorite of Brand's stories is this one (I'm telling this from 
<br>
memory, so if anyone else is familiar with the story &amp; I've not got it 
<br>
exactly right, please feel free to correct me):  In the 1800's the oak 
<br>
beams supporting the roof of the New College at Oxford began to show signs 
<br>
of rotting serious enough to threaten the structural soundness of the 
<br>
building. Huge oak beams were not easy to come by in that time and place, 
<br>
so the men in charge of doing the repairs were happy to note a grove of oak 
<br>
trees of the right size growing nearby. They used these trees to make the 
<br>
repairs. Research into the history of the trees revealed that they had been 
<br>
planted at the same time the building was constructed in the 1300's--for 
<br>
the express purpose of providing new beams 500 or more years in the future 
<br>
when they would be necessary for repairs.
<br>
<p>This story moves me in the same way I'm moved by the most magnificent 
<br>
symphonic music. It speaks to me of human love that transcends time and is 
<br>
the closest thing to &quot;god&quot; I can imagine. The people who built the New 
<br>
College were not unfamiliar with singularities. Looking back across a span 
<br>
of more than 600 years, the plague epidemics appear as small blips on the 
<br>
graph of steady growth of human population. But I suspect that a person 
<br>
who'd lived through one of these catastrophic periods would have felt quite 
<br>
at home with the idea of a singularity (using the term in a general way to 
<br>
refer to a discontinuity in a function describing growth of 
<br>
population/technology over time). They were on intimate terms with 
<br>
uncertainty; they had seen civilization knocked to its knees by the Black 
<br>
Death. And yet--they planted oak trees to be used for repairs 500 down the 
<br>
pike.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Where we differ is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we think that this will not hold forever. The singularity can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen as a bifurcation point in the mathematical sense, where a smooth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and incremental change of one parameter leads to a discontinous or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least qualitatively different behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is not really part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brand's view of how things are looking.
</em><br>
<p>As I said, I haven't read the LONG NOW, but I'm not so sure Brand wouldn't 
<br>
understand the idea of qualitative change. In fact, he argues for 
<br>
flexibility in designing cities and buildings to accommodate change. Where 
<br>
he differs from some of the Extropians is that he sees the possibility of 
<br>
communicating with whoever or whatever is here long after our civilization 
<br>
has become a mere blip on the graph. I don't know how much my being a 
<br>
parent influences my thinking about the future--probably a lot--but I like 
<br>
the Brand's faith that some form of intelligence will still exist 10,000 
<br>
years from now and that it will CARE about those who came before. This is 
<br>
an example of the transcendent love I was talking about earlier. The clock 
<br>
is like a love letter from those who are intelligent now to those who are 
<br>
intelligent later. (in a sense, it might be a love letter to ourselves, but 
<br>
even if some of us manage to achieve a form of immortality, we surely will 
<br>
be quite different creatures in 10,000 years from the humans we are now)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;On the truly big scale - where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neanderthals, homo sapiens, homo excelsior and all their weird
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descendants are close neighbours - I think many of us roughly agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with him again that things are fairly smooth.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. You can count me among those who agree with Brand in this respect.
