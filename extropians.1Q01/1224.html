Subject: Re: Placebo effect not physical
<br>
<p>Hi Dan
<br>
<p>Finally got round to rest of reply to last Monday's mailing.
<br>
I should mail you a (gratis) copy of the MVT 1hr. film,
<br>
Strange Case of the Third Eye. Maybe this will clear some
<br>
points up ..... contact me off-line if you want me to mail you
<br>
this .......
<br>
<p>S&gt; You are also committing a well-known error by conflating &quot;exists&quot;
<br>
S&gt; with &quot;physical&quot; (the same strategy that was used in one of the
<br>
S&gt; well-known arguments for the existence of God).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't know that one.  I know quite a few of these, but it'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting to hear another.  Or maybe you have a different gloss on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an old argument?
</em><br>
<p>The argument is something like &quot;Anything that can be thought of
<br>
could exist, God is the greatest thing that can be thought of, there is
<br>
a necessity that there is a &quot;greatest thing&quot; that can be thought of,
<br>
therefore God exists.&quot;
<br>
<p>S&gt; Absolutely .. under *your* definition of physical MVT is physical!
<br>
S&gt; I just don't find any value in your definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I raised that point to emphasize that MVT is *not* physical, and,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;therefore, if physicalism is correct, MVT is wrong.  My definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical does *not* include non-verifiable mental objects.
</em><br>
<p>I fail to see any distinction between your &quot;physical second-order
<br>
concepts&quot; and &quot;non-verifiable mental objects&quot;. We are talking about the
<br>
same phenomena, but you pre-fix &quot;physical&quot; to everything. So my
<br>
&quot;mental event&quot; is your &quot;physical mental event.&quot; I hate philosophical jargon
<br>
and so try with MVT to stick to discussion of the phenomena at issue.
<br>
<p>Neither of us can verify our thoughts ultimately .... the idealist claims
<br>
that
<br>
our thoughts &quot;verify&quot; us. (I don't want to get bogged down in discussing
<br>
Prof. N . Malcolm's Verificationism here by the way).
<br>
<p>S&gt; But your physicalism &quot;denies that symbols are anything more than their
<br>
S&gt; physical part.  e.g. Writing is nothing more than scratches on paper&quot; but
<br>
S&gt; now in response to my point you add a qualifier about &quot;USE&quot; made by
<br>
S&gt; them, which seems an intentional quality rather than anything physical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I was *correcting* myself.  Note the use of &quot;forgive me.&quot;  While use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is &quot;intentional,&quot; &quot;intentions&quot; are properties of physical objects, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are thus physical properties.
</em><br>
<p>So are all &quot;properties&quot; of a thing the same as the thing itself then?
<br>
<p>Or perhaps a &quot;property&quot; of a thing, like engine noise is a
<br>
property of motor-cars, extends further than the physical motor-car,
<br>
perhaps a property of the motor car is the worry caused by the owner
<br>
because the road-tax has run out .. how far do we want the term
<br>
&quot;property&quot; to stretch?
<br>
<p>Perhaps physical objects are themselves properties of (hidden)
<br>
mental objects?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There's no non-physical thing at work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here.  Just physical brains and physical bodies emitting physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sounds and making physical scratches on paper.  The scratches on paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bear physical relations to other physical objects.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know you always come back to this stark epihenomenalist claim,
<br>
but I thing this is only a partial description of the world. I think that
<br>
you
<br>
need to explain the conscious mechanisms involved in translating from
<br>
the purely physical scratches to the whole rich and varied sentient
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p>You could accommodate the phantom (felt, not cellular) median eye
<br>
within your taxonomy as a &quot;property of a once-present physical
<br>
median eye&quot; without calling it a non-material object. Does this help?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Properties of a non-physical object?  No good.  As far as I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;concerned, ideas may be properties of physical objects, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;second-order properties of properties of physical objects, but at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;end of the day, it must be a physical property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; But this is pure conjecture, just your &quot;idea&quot;, what evidence do
<br>
S&gt; you back this with? I can back up MVT with scientific experiment
<br>
S&gt; and observation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Excuse me?  Reread the claim that I made.  I said that there are only
</em><br>
physical objects and properties of physical objects.  You do *not*
<br>
<em>&gt;have an experiment to show that there are non-physical objects.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might think that some of your experiments make it natural to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there are some non-physical objects, but I happen to find that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notion rather unnatural.
</em><br>
<p>I want to say that the phantom pineal eye more than an  &quot;idea of a
<br>
physical pineal eye&quot;    ... in the way that such an idea might take a
<br>
few seconds to have and then pass away. If you want to call it an
<br>
&quot;idea&quot; or a &quot;property of a historical pineal eye&quot; I don't care ..... but
<br>
the fact is that the idea is more pervasive/ persistent, not only because
<br>
it is more profound, but that it is the source of any other idea/ property
<br>
of a physical object.
<br>
<p>During the mammalian-reptilian interface, when the pineal eye was lost in
<br>
our ancestors, huge tranches of behaviour that had been governed by
<br>
photo-cellular and endocrinal effects that originated with solar radiation
<br>
and were received by the pineal eye receptor became *internalised* to
<br>
control by the individual (warm-blooded) animal. E-2 conscious (experience
<br>
behaviour, or epiphenomenona .. take your pick) originated at this period
<br>
and because of biophysical evolutionary changes.
<br>
<p>You cannot say &quot;which initiated which&quot;, because the conscious changes
<br>
(new REM associated brain states due to phasic transients in particular)
<br>
and the physical changes occurred *concurrently*
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Every part of the brain can be observed, in principle if not today in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practice.  (You're not a Penrosian, are you?)
</em><br>
<p>No, though I touch on this in the film.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The brain follows all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ordinary physical laws, and we can watch it do so under a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microscope.  Some aspects of brain functioning are opaque to us today,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but as nanotechnology develops we'll be able to observe the details
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even more closely.
</em><br>
<p>I think some further *analysis* needs to be conceptual in addition to
<br>
building bigger and better microscope. MVT is conceptual as
<br>
well as physical, in that some claims can be tested empirically
<br>
but that some claims are, necessarily, inferred. These claims rely
<br>
on triangulation of circumstantial evidence from different scientific
<br>
fields, explanatory and utility functions, and 'pattern completion' or
<br>
'elegance.'
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The brain &quot;cannot be observed&quot; only in the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the workings of the Pentium III cannot be observed: they're both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very small and hard to watch closely with today's technology.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they're both Turing equivalents.  (Equivalents.  Not machines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Equivalents.)
</em><br>
<p>Neurons cab be observed, and these function more like
<br>
Rosenblatt's Perceptron architecture than ant Turing model.
<br>
<p>Sure, the PIII has a strong analogy (equivalence) with Turing model,
<br>
but brains have stronger analogy with non-Turing or algorithmic models,
<br>
for instance Back-Propagation seems a more mathematically exact
<br>
equivalence than Turing-Church.  So I disagree with you on fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No one can present a case so water-tight that you can't interpret it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in some perverse way.
</em><br>
<p>So you say, but I think that MVT (together with applications from it
<br>
such as my new, Reverse-Hypnosis(TM)) should be so persuasive
<br>
that nobody would seriously bother to reinterpret it perversely ... a
<br>
strong argument should be tight enough that any perverse interpretation
<br>
of it would seem ridiculous.
<br>
<p>The blunt facts and argument have to hold up as well of course, so
<br>
I invite and appreciate counter-arguments such as inthis thread.
<br>
<p>It is hard to reinterpret Darwin's main points about fossils supporting
<br>
an evolutionary theory of history ... but some rabid fundamentalists
<br>
argue that we cannot be sure that the fossils weren't planted by Satan
<br>
to fool the scientists! Same with MVT .....  why don't you try to come up
<br>
with a perverse interpretation of the same empirical studies?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter of interpretation so as to
<br>
<em>&gt;maximize correctness.  I'm not saying that at the end of the day you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to agree with me, but you need to interpret what I say such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is as agreeable as possible.  This may turn out to be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agreeable than your own position, but until you do the earlier work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you'll never know.  It's easy to find dumb interpretations, and if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stop there you'll never understand your opponents' arguments.
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes I use reductio ad absurdum with your points, but it is
<br>
not to be disagreeable, there will be a serious point in there somewhere.
<br>
I do understand pretty much where you are coming from, yours is a
<br>
standard conventionalist position ... or do you have some unique spin
<br>
that I have missed altogether?
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; There are records of young car crash victims who lived an apparently
<br>
S&gt; normal life, but on autopsy it was discovered that only 5% of their
<br>
brains
<br>
S&gt; had been functioning! If brain damage occurs at an early enough age
<br>
S&gt; it is plastic enough that any part of the brain can take over functions
<br>
of
<br>
S&gt; any other part ... so you are wrong in fact on this issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I knew this, and nothing I said contradicts this.  All I insist is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the brain has a non-plastic property or two, that it's not protean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in quite *every* way.  The characteristics which it can't change are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the hardware.  The ones that it can change are the software.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ardware of the brain happens to be Turing equivalent.  Some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ardware of the brain, like the laws of physics, can't break at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and so it's obviously nonsense to talk about self-repair in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ases).  But some of the hardware of the brain can break in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on-reparable way.  When it does, the brain is as helpless as a Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine with a broken servo.  Hardware need not be fragile, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rain does have some.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, obviously. The brain has both finite-state *and* infinite-state
<br>
components ... but you only need one infinite-state component to
<br>
give whole circuit infinite-state (reconfigurable) capabilities!
<br>
<p><p>S We have already decided that *real-time* responses cannot be
<br>
S simulated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;irrelevant.  The limitations to which I refer are not speed-related.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm happy to admit that neural computers can outstrip serial Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machines in speed in solving some problems.  (Though not all.)
</em><br>
<p>Speed isn't the issue. One system works, one pixel or bit at a time
<br>
in lock-step ..... the other works with groups or all pixels or bits at
<br>
once, and in non-linear bursts. How more different can you get?
<br>
<p>S&gt; Neither could a big Turing machine have evolved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also irrelevant.  Being evolved or not has nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior, nothing to do with today's limitations.  You're telling me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;properties they don't share.  I agree with you about these.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;telling you some properties that they DO share.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you seem to be admitting that my analogy to brains
<br>
explain *all* or *more* properties than your model, which you
<br>
concede only shares *some* properties with brains. Thus your
<br>
analogy is the weaker and can safely be discarded.
<br>
<p>S&gt; The brain can develop entirely new modules (eg. the neocortex)
<br>
S&gt; in response to changing environmental demands, how would your
<br>
S&gt; Turing machine do this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You'll hate my answer.  The brain can't develop entirely new hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Entirely new physical layout is not hardware: it's software.  Hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the part you can't change, by definition.  Neither can the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develop software beyond what its hardware allows, neither can the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain develop software in some non-deterministic non-random way.  So,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what can the brain do?  Develop &quot;new&quot; modules following the rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encoded in its hardware.  The Turing machine could do that, too, if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were fast enough.  (And, again, speed is irrelevant to my claims about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general limitations.)
</em><br>
<p>You're correct -- I do hate your answer! But as we discussed on plasticity,
<br>
not all modules of the brain are composed of the same types of cells, and
<br>
different, earlier systems might not be plastic in the same way as other
<br>
parts,
<br>
whereas your Turing machine can only manufacturemore of what it knows,
<br>
NOT mutate different types of cells and functioning for new behavioural
<br>
demands.  If you come back with &quot;What about G.A.'s&quot; my response is
<br>
that Genetic Algorithms require a serial computer to run on, but the only
<br>
types of circuits we find in the brain are massively parallel distributed!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;They only need to have a few characteristics in common to be &quot;similar&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the way I mean.  As far as I'm concerned, transistors and wooden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rods are &quot;equivalent&quot; for the purposes of this conversation: the rods
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Babbage's engine are equivalent to the transistors in modern-day
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desktops.  They have little in common (and heaven knows that no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wooden-rod computer could have evolved under normal circumstances),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but just enough to make my point. The computers themselves are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analogous to individual neurons, but the arrangement of neurons is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analogous to the connection of many computers, of many Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machines, which is equivalent in behavior to one big fast Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine.
</em><br>
<p>Behaviour, but what about the conscious experience? Wood and
<br>
metal do not share properties with organic systems. Furthermore,
<br>
how do your (non-growing, non-regenerative) Babbage engines
<br>
manage to lose a major part of their structure (pineal eye, which
<br>
was shared by all (or virtually all) vertebrate species at least as far
<br>
back as the jawless fishes of the Ordovician age, and yet not only
<br>
continue to self-program and function in a tough, learning environment,
<br>
but actually 'improve' and expand their behavioural repertoire beyond
<br>
the original system constraints?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If anything, you might try poking holes at my claim that many Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machines hooked together are equivalent to one big Turing machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(since, of course, the one big one couldn't do what the many little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ones could as quickly, or in quite the same way) but the analogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between a neuron and a Turing machine is pretty strong.
</em><br>
<p>No, hadn't thought of this. I don't think complexity = self-awareness,
<br>
so the number of Turing machines is beside the point ..... I think
<br>
that to recreate or model the world &quot;virtually&quot; requires part of the
<br>
conscious system itself to be &quot;virtual&quot; ... that's all MVT
<br>
stronger claim really is .. pretty value-free on Physicalism Vs
<br>
Idealism and all other second-order theories that come from
<br>
our &quot;minds.&quot; MVT answers the really important basic questions,
<br>
the rest (of academic philosophy) is just *argumentative froth.*
<br>
<p>S&gt; But only &quot;materials&quot; can be verified (molecular descriptions?) by
<br>
S&gt; science, whereas you widen the claim for physicality to everything,
<br>
S&gt; even principles, which cannot be verified as materials. No  way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sentences *are* physical.  I can not only point sentences, I can even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drop them on my foot.  You KNOW something's physical when you can drop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it on your foot.
</em><br>
<p>MVT is more interested in the medium itself than particular forms or types
<br>
of message ..... a sentence engraved on stone can be dropped on your
<br>
foot, but not one spoken and heard over the radio airways, or voiced
<br>
silently
<br>
and internally by the reader. And it is these internal states, and how the
<br>
brain
<br>
co-operates in bringing them about, that is at issue between us.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Yes, ditch the philosophy by all means. It is quite inadequate.
<br>
S&gt; I argue for a post-human aesthetic that can embrace the
<br>
S&gt; powerful new vocabulary and world-view that MVT offers. The
<br>
S&gt; many various mental phenomena can all be described using
<br>
S&gt; the evolutionary narrative (scientific) offered by MVT, whereas
<br>
S&gt; the old philosophical jargon offers nothing. I disagree with you
<br>
S&gt; that functionalism solves Leibnitz Law , by the way, on any
<br>
S&gt; level other than by linguistic contrivance. MVT offers a constructive
<br>
S&gt; reconciliation by means of the virtual generic sensor as a bridge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Here, I think, you just referred to an argument which you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present, but didn't actually bring one to the table.  Obviously a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functionalist might say the same about MVT.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry if I have not made my point clearly. It is for &quot;identity&quot; as
<br>
opposed to the much weaker &quot;equivalence&quot; that you seem happy with.
<br>
MVT is the Rolls-Royce/ Supreme stretched Cadillac of theories in
<br>
that it tackles Leibnitz' objection to Descartes *full on*. No
<br>
substitutes accepted .... I say that the phantom median eye
<br>
IS identical with the experience of consciousness, not just an
<br>
equivalent substitute or an analogy.
<br>
<p>Full equivalence (= Identity)  requires INTERCHANGEABILITY.
<br>
<p>S&gt; God is a fictional character .... he cannot be pointed to so is not
<br>
S&gt; a physical object ... but how is he a &quot;property of a physical object?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Fictional characters aren't properties of physical objects.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aren't anything at all.
</em><br>
<p>Then how can we discuss them at all?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We accept some truth claims about them, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's a relationship between us and the sentences, not between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything and the characters.
</em><br>
<p>But sentences can be broken down into participles, words, tenses,
<br>
objects/ characters &amp;c. They are not inviable units. If you ask someone
<br>
what they thought of Leo 'Sprout-face' di Caprio's character in Titanic
<br>
they can't respond to you by talking about the &quot;sentences.&quot;
<br>
<p>S&gt; What you call a &quot;physical property&quot; could equally well be described as
<br>
S&gt; a &quot;concept.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The words &quot;property&quot; and &quot;concept&quot; are often used interchangeably, but,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of course, one of them is held by the object with nobody else around,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the other is something that we have relative to the object.
</em><br>
<p>But if &quot;nobody else&quot; is around, and the concept doesn't happen to be
<br>
written down, then how under your schema does it &quot;exist?&quot;
<br>
<p>S&gt; We also cannot describe what &quot;Laws&quot; are in operation at the point of
<br>
S&gt; singularity in a black hole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So what?  There are no black holes in the brain.  The laws of physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;operate just fine there.
</em><br>
<p>But if physics can't reveal to us a person's inner landscape then
<br>
either (1) it isn't in the brain, or (2) the physical laws aren't adequate
<br>
and some Phenomenal Laws (MVT) that build on the directly observable
<br>
effects is needed in addition, or (3) there is nothing happening other than
<br>
billions of electrochemical impulses, and the person has no felt or
<br>
perceptual experience.
<br>
<p>The Laws of Physics fail by omission as a &quot;complete&quot; or unified
<br>
field account that includes mental events. Maybe MVT can be incorporated
<br>
in the current Laws of Physics, or maybe it will amend them or even
<br>
point to entirely new ones ..... I don't know yet .....

<p>It is with certain claims about cellular (pineal eyes). For example,
<br>
it fills the same shape/ field of vision as the cellular organ, pivotal
<br>
between the external and internal worlds. The shape of the cellular
<br>
brain arose because of co-existence with pineal sensory input over
<br>
the millennia, and there is a physical foramen as well as pathway gaps
<br>
in the shapes and sulcesses of the brain, channels for passing pineal
<br>
data back and forth, and connections at deep levels of the brain (even
<br>
pre-dating optic lobes) for pineal sense-data processing.
<br>
<p>The phantom arm can cause behaviour to the person in exactly the same
<br>
way as its physical template ... experiments prove that patients will
<br>
instinctively act (to cover face with phantom arm as they used to with
<br>
physical arm, or complaining that a shoe fitted over the foot of a wooden
<br>
leg feels too tight if, and falling over by &quot;forgetting&quot; that leg not longer
<br>
present.
<br>
<p>I argue that as we go on and evolve over time, variation from the cellular
<br>
template or blueprint of mind will increase, and 'self' control take over
<br>
even
<br>
more from environment, external signals and solar/ physical constraints.
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; But if you claim this, then &quot;brain states&quot; and &quot;thinks&quot; are the same
<br>
thing,
<br>
S&gt; so you can substitute one for the other in any sentence without changing
<br>
the
<br>
S&gt; meaning? Is this what you are saying?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They are, of course, different parts of speech.
</em><br>
<p>Different sentences entirely then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To be precise: &quot;is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking&quot; is interchangeable with &quot;is in certain brain states.&quot;  &quot;is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking about X&quot; is interchangeable with &quot;has certain brain symbols
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which refer to X.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Then how we do actually describe that someone is in particular
<br>
brain states (for example, I might want to say that their left
<br>
pre-frontal cortex seems particularly active today, but all you can
<br>
describe to me are the thoughts going through their head about exams
<br>
or whatever ... do you see my point. Not interchangeable.
<br>
<p>S&gt; How do I measure &quot;meaning&quot; ..... what tests can I do
<br>
S&gt; and what physical measurements do I take, using
<br>
S&gt; what instruments?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Lexicography.  Sociology.  Anthropology.  Meaning is use.  You look
</em><br>
and see how people use the words.  You write it down.  You publish
<br>
<em>&gt;articles about it.  You participate in the writing of dictionaries and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encyclopaedias.  Did you not notice that Linguistics is a science?
</em><br>
<p>Meaning sometimes is associated with uses of particular knowledge,
<br>
but not always and not necessarily. You are talking about applications
<br>
from concepts/ meanings ... and even some of these uses might not
<br>
be measurable.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I disagree that a serial simulation is identical with a physical,
<br>
parallel
<br>
S&gt; instantiation ... they may exhibit behaviour that we think is equivalent,
<br>
S&gt; but one is algorithmic and provable at any point, and the other is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Both are algorithmic, but one has a more complex program than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other.  Look at actual parallel neural computers.  There is absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an algorithm which completely describes their behavior.  It's a bitch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to write down, but it's obviously there.  Stringing together
</em><br>
<em>&gt;algorithmic components makes for a more complex algorithmic object,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not something radically non-algorithmic.
</em><br>
<p>There are quite a few mathematical formulae that describe how
<br>
neural computers can be instantiated on serial computers ... but these
<br>
algorithms are just to get the things simulated. The actual brains or
<br>
clusters of networks do not have any identifiable algorithms, or even
<br>
internal states that correspond to particular symbols more often than not.
<br>
<p>Are you talking about these mathematical equations as algorithms?
<br>
<p>S&gt; Of course, reciprocally, there is not task that can be performed by a
<br>
S&gt; (dumb but fast) Turing machine or von Neumann that cannot be done
<br>
S&gt; using parallel distributed architectures .....  but I do not claim that
<br>
S&gt; somehow von Neumann processors are REALLY neural computers,
<br>
S&gt; or that neural architecture has *anything whatsoever* to do with their
<br>
S&gt; design or evolution. They are just a (less optimised) alternative!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Turing machines ARE neural computer equivalents.  But that says more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the neural computers than it does about Turing machines.
</em><br>
<p>Are you just saying that Land-Rover are Suzuki 4-wheel equivalents, or
<br>
that a bicycle is a Land Rover equivalent because it has wheels and
<br>
transports people along a road ... you must take my point that Identity
<br>
is what we need, not (ill-defined) but lesser *equivalence*.
<br>
<p>S&gt; The medical literature on why (in ALL cases of recorded traumatic
<br>
S&gt; organ loss) we have phantom sensations explains this point adequately.
<br>
S&gt; There is a necessity about such phenomena, not a voluntary choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, I agree that people feel that way.  You don't tell me anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the mechanism by which people feel.  You tell me about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanism by which people act like they're in pain.  But you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;show me how the pain links up with the brain states.
</em><br>
<p>I refer you to the Gate Theory of Pain. I actually think that pain, since
<br>
it comes through nerves at the skin, has different attentional mechanism
<br>
than reflective thought, where the MVT model has more to say. It is
<br>
more of a reflex experience than consciously (internally) generated,
<br>
but, sure, hypnosis can work as anaesthesia, so some is evoked
<br>
centrally rather than just peripheral to the damaged limb/ skin.
<br>
<p>S&gt; The neurosignatures are generated along with 'phantom eye'
<br>
S&gt; information thereby identifying this information as &quot;self&quot; originating,
<br>
S&gt; but distinct from signals originating at the retina and so on.
<br>
S&gt; I accept Melzacks' neuromatrix theory of self, by and large.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, this is not enough.  Identification as &quot;self&quot; originating might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be the same as feeling, depending on what you meant by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;identification.&quot;  If it IS the same as feeling, you've left it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mystery HOW this &quot;identification&quot; feeling happens, which is different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from (ta-da) identification brain states.  If it isn't, then you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;left the feelings mysterious and told me all about brain states.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;No solution.
</em><br>
<p>No, the neurosignature recognition is pre-conscious (not revealed
<br>
to consciousness). This checking is pure brain-state. We are just
<br>
left with the &quot;feeling&quot; or consciousness, the background processing
<br>
is transparent
<br>
to us.
<br>
<p>S&gt; &gt;Neural computers, all of them, are Turing machine equivalents.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; No ... as discussed above, I can simulate all the behaviours of a
<br>
S&gt; Turing machine on neural systems, but they are not identical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Read what I said.  Read what you said.  I said &quot;equivalent.&quot;  You said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;identical.&quot;  You ignore what I say and knock down a straw man who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinks that they're identical.  What's the point?  Pay attention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Equivalence&quot; and &quot;identity&quot; are radically different relations.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is exactly that you can only show &quot;equivalence&quot; and not
<br>
&quot;identity&quot; that makes your theory a Straw Man.  I want to show
<br>
that MVT is more complete and better than competing theories,
<br>
I don't necessarily have to disprove your Turing theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To be &quot;equivalent&quot; is to have one relevant property in common.  To be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;identical&quot; is to have ALL of one's properties in common.  If you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I need a green thing! bring me a pear!&quot; and I bring you a green
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apple, you say &quot;this is not an pear!&quot; I'll say &quot;I know, but this apple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is equivalent to the pear: they are both green.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It is foolish to then say &quot;but pears are different from apples!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because we both know that.  The question is whether they are different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a RELEVANT way.  They need not be identical to be equivalent.  Get it?
</em><br>
<p>I say they are different in several relevant ways ....... by MVT you
<br>
get what you see, and apple is an apple ... your theory is undiscerning
<br>
in that it seems a pear might do instead. I want to *identify* the
<br>
mechanisms
<br>
of E-2 consciousness, and intelligence, and not just to say it is something
<br>
like a theoretical Turing machine that never has, and never will, be built.
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; You accept that the Turing machine is running neural simulations in
<br>
S&gt; lock-step (very fast, but not INSTANT) .. and so you fail on your
<br>
S&gt; equivalence claim just on the real-time property alone .... and I
<br>
S&gt; think there are further differences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The fact that they differ on one property, or two, or a hundred, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even more properties, doesn't imply that they aren't equivalent.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only need to share the relevant properties (which, as far as I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerned, are only one or two).
</em><br>
<p>Surely better to share more properties (including all your &quot;relevant&quot;
<br>
ones) just for the sake of theoretical completeness?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm definitely starting to tire here... as school starts up again, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may have to drop this end.  We'll see how much longer I can go.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree .... why not slow the cycle of replies down to about one
<br>
a week? It isn't, I admit, an entirely pointless exercise for me as,
<br>
with your permission (?) I intend to include these postings as part of
<br>
the FAQ section of my Primal Eye/ MVT Encyclopedia soon forthcoming ....
<br>
<p>Let me know about getting a copy of the film to you ...
