</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never claimed that any corporation committed genocide (or any other crime) without

</em><br>

<em>&gt; they have co-opted the local government. How would it follow then that this makes the government the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; will is wrong (or at least undesirable) no matter who is doing it. Certainly you can't disagree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that? And laying all the blame on governments is no more useful for solving the problem than laying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the blame on corporations. I'm trying to look at all the factors involved from as clear a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective as I can muster, rather than trying to make things adhere to any one ideology. Solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more important to me than blaming and name-calling.
</em><br>
<p>No name calling intended. I am looking at the flows of power, where is
<br>
the nexus? In government, not in corporations. Government is a lever,
<br>
its laws, constitution, and legal precedents being a fulcrum. How big
<br>
that fulcrum is, and where it is placed, determines who controls power.
<br>
Limiting liberty of the individual gives great mechanical advantage
<br>
against the individual to any that seek to profit from doing so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But you do need a government to force private citizens to sit there and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take it without any force in kind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can call it government, the anarchists can call it corporations; it really doesn't matter as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long as it is happening. But by limiting ourselves to only one interpretation, we could be missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something important. Again, let's look for solutions.
</em><br>
<p>I am in full agreement with concepts of limiting the power of
<br>
corporations. Where do they get that power? From governments. The
<br>
solution is in limiting the ability of governments to grant power to
<br>
anyone but individuals in excess of the power posessed by an individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Each individual would be capable of defending themselves against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corporate gangs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is unrealistic. Do you have your own private army?
</em><br>
<p>Not necessary, as anyone with military experience can tell you,
<br>
especially those who have studied unconventional warfare. Gangs are not
<br>
interested in dying, they are interested in getting paid, making a
<br>
profit on their risk. You need not kill all of them in order to deter
<br>
their agression. Making the risk exceed the benefits is all that is
<br>
needed. In an attack/defense situation, the defender always has the
<br>
advantage in the order of 10 to 1 up to as much as 100 to 1 or more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Corporate abuses occur because they have the power of government to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; support them. Remove the sovereign monopoly of government and corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use of force withers away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you saying that individuals and groups of people will always behave themselves (i.e., treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people's rights wth respect) as long as no one is telling them it's wrong to do so? Well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe you would act that way and I would act that way, but can you really guarantee that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will? This seems unrealistic and contradictory to your own philosophy (at least what I've seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented in this forum). Given an ideal state in which everyone shared the same basic values and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect for one another, I suppose this is possible. But I believe you yourself said that an ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state is unstable. This seems contradictory.
</em><br>
<p>No, in a situation where any individual has the ability to mete out
<br>
force against agressors that is not limited by police forces or laws
<br>
about legitimate levels of force, then people and groups will act far
<br>
more civilly than when individual liberty is restrained by government
<br>
police forces, leaving them open to victimization by larger groups. Do
<br>
you think that corporations would not behave in a world where there were
<br>
no anti-terrorist laws, no anti-union laws, no anti-protest laws? Police
<br>
forces, the data proves, serve mostly to protect criminals from the
<br>
righteous anger of their victims, not to protect innocent people from
<br>
criminals. Likewise, government's job in reality (not ideally) is to
<br>
limit the individual's ability to resist domination by larger groups or
<br>
individuals, to force people to grin and bear it when they are getting
<br>
screwed. Remove government's ability to do so, and corporations will be
<br>
unable to victimize and abuse without just retribution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet you speak of genocide. Wife burning on the scale that occured in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; India prior to British conquest was on the same scale as many genocides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that have occured in history. It belittles women's rights to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this practice is not genocidal-equivalent and that it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; protected as some sort of 'cultural tradition' that is worthy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; respect. Its pathetic relativist crap like that that is truly hogwash.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would never condone wife burning in any culture, nor am I a cultural relativist when it comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such behaviors. I'm pretty sure I didn't make any such claims. As I tried to say, conquering a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country that indulges in this kind of behavior by committing equaly atrocious acts against them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not really something to be proud of. And if you think this can be used as a justification for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British conquest of India, you're simply wrong. There is no historical evidence that they conquered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; India in order to keep women from being burned by their husbands. Rather, India was conquered to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further their own selfish ends, which makes them no better than any of the other oppressive groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (like the communists) you've decried. This is the problem I have with imperialism, and it astonishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me that you, a self-proclaimed libertarian, could defend it.
</em><br>
<p>The question with India is to ask if it is in better condition than if
<br>
the British had never dipped their hands in, no matter how selfishly.
<br>
All of the problems that India has, in my view, tend to be problems
<br>
caused by cultural practices remaining that predate the British era.
<br>
Left uninfluenced, India in my view would have currently become a rather
<br>
nasty combination of Balkan politics and African chaos and brutality.
<br>
<p>As a Scot whose family was brutally persecuted and forcibly removed from
<br>
the Gordon lands after Culloden, shipped to Nova Scotia and left
<br>
abandoned, I would never claim that the British colonial mentality was
<br>
in any way considerate of individual rights or cultural heritage.
<br>
However, I think its rather indicative that survive assimilation in
<br>
British colonized nations tend to be far more civil and humane
<br>
individuals than groups left to their own devices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are, in fact, as many Native Americans in north america today as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there were before the conquistadors. Native Americans today live an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; average of twice as long as their forebears, with a far higher standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of living.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, because some of the descendents of the conquered people have a higher standard of living (again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your definition), this justifies centuries of genocide? Why would you defend this? Isn't the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcible removal of any individual's liberty antithetical to the libertarian position? And how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Native Americans have you interviewed? There is a strong body of anthropological and anecdotal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that suggests life has been pretty bad for most Native Americans since the white man came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (if this has changed for the better, it's been very recently). Why deny this? You're not personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible, yet you seem to cling to out-moded rationalizations like your life depended on it. Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is it so hard to admit what was done, even condemn it, and then use this knowledge to help us move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward so we can all have better, longer, happier lives? This seems reasonable to me. But, hey, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an optimist.
</em><br>
<p>Most all of native american deaths occured during the Conquest period
<br>
when conquistadors were not only completely unaware of the cause of
<br>
diseases that killed off millions of natives in virgin field epidemics,
<br>
they were typically hundreds if not thousands of miles away from most of
<br>
the deaths when they happened. Calling this genocide is like accusing
<br>
some ancient Babylonian of genocide for playing with rats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Whether they become serfs or not is irrelevant. Were they abused by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imperialists more than they were under their local rulers? Look at Hong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Kong, Singapore, and many other asian nations that were formerly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; colonies. The local rulers claim that political repression is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'cultural tradition' when westerners protest against it. Bollocks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is any form of serfdom irrelevant? To claim that's it was okay for one group to conquer another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they're not quite as bad is ludicrous. Aren't all forms of oppression wrong? We see to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreeing here, but I feel like you're clinging to something.
</em><br>
<p>Clining to the idea of being humane versus inhumane. Its not all black
<br>
and white. Do you claim that Jefferson was an abominable criminal for
<br>
owning slaves?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't have a dark view of humanity, or of evolution. It seems you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a dark view of what I see as a natural system. Like a communalist, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assume that the natural system is dark, harsh, evil and bad in a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Calvinist/Puritan sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you feel the need to label me a communalist when I have never once claimed to be one? This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only counter-productive, it is insulting. And to compare me to a Calvinist/Puritan is laughable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm about as far from that position as Pluto is from the sun. If I said something that honestly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicates this to you, please point it out to me and I will be happy to clarify it.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to cling to this idea, like many on the left, that government
<br>
is good and private individuals are prone to do evil things if left to
<br>
their own devices, so government of some sort is needed to save them
<br>
from their own corruption. This is crap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Human nature doesn't need to be changed, it needs to be informed. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't need to be chained, it needs to be unleashed and empowered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People are at their best when left to their own devices. It is only when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you confiscate liberty and concentrate power that you get abuses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corruption arises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would never disagree with you on this, and am curious as to why you felt compelled to respond with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Do you think I said something to indicate otherwise? Very curious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm beginning to suspect that we could go around and around with this for some time. I also think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are often arguing for the same things, but are simply coming at it from disparate points of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view. This is good. It's what makes us individuals, and what keeps healthy discourse interesting.
</em><br>
<p>I hope I am wrong in my impression of you, but it seems ludicrous to me
<br>
that someone could claim that a group like a corporation, which has no
<br>
inherent rights in and of itself, is more prone to commit evil acts than
<br>
some group like a government, which is duly delegated power by all
<br>
individuals in society, which is the body that empowers corporations to
<br>
do the things they do. Anyone who feels thus can only logically do so if
<br>
they posess some innate distrust of the individual as an evil creature
<br>
in need of restraint.
