like a

</em><br>

</em><br>

then an
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; **I believe what he's saying is that all, or at least many, eventualities

useless--but
<br>

</em><br>
<p>That remains to be proved.  Actually, the opposite seems to be the case.
<br>
See, e.g., the work of Motoo Kimura.  The thing is a lot of this random
<br>
change fits mathematical models of being -- you guessed it! -- random.  Now,
<br>
if one distinguishes between passive and active sites on DNA and protein and
<br>
one realizes, as I state above, that most of any strand of DNA or protein is
<br>
passive, it's not surprising that lots of random changes would have no
<br>
effect whatsoever on the phenotype -- and hence would not be inputs for
<br>
environmental [boundary] selection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Genomes, in general, are very resilient to some disruptions.  Even
</em><br>
though,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; e.g., humans get cancer, even most cancer victims live long enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reproduce, raise their children, and so on.  I would look at the problem
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other way.  Why is there so little information in any genome of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relevance to the organism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **See above point. Little of relevance to the organism _in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present environment._
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you're positing some forwarding-tracking mechanism -- some means by
<br>
which any genome can predict future environments -- then please elaborate.
<br>
I do not believe in such mechanisms.  At least, I haven't seen a convincing
<br>
one yet.  That said, there's no reason to discount orthogenetic processes,
<br>
such as S. A. Kauffman (in _The Origins of Order_ and elsewhere) has
<br>
detailed.  But these processes do not seem to track future environments.
<br>
Instead, they are more akin to complex systems having certain inner
<br>
directions -- states toward which they tend.
<br>
<p>Sometimes, I believe, the system (gene, genome, organism, population,
<br>
species, ecosystem, etc.) can head in only a few directions AND
<br>
environmental selection couples with it.  This makes for rapid change which
<br>
might seem outwardly directed -- as if by some mind.  A lot of this is
<br>
detailed in _Evolution as Entropy_ by Brooks and Wiley.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
