<p>
<em>&gt; The rest of the world functions on the delusion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'society' is some living entity
</em><br>
<p>I believe society _is_ a living entity. A pretty dumb one, but I think it
<br>
could be construed as being alive. (In the sense of an ant colony or a bee
<br>
hive, for instance.)
<br>
<p>As we become more and more connected (eg, via the internet and, in the
<br>
future, via even faster and more ubiquitous methods of communication), I
<br>
believe the 'society' will take on even more characteristics of a living
<br>
being. As our rate of communication increases, our decisions will be more
<br>
affected by information we receive: our activities, although individually
<br>
chosen to fulfill our own desires, will become more synchronized than they
<br>
would have been without an efficient connection. Ultimately, with the advent
<br>
of implants that could facilitate practical telepathy, millions of human
<br>
beings could form something that might be perceived as a single mind. This
<br>
will show especially strongly in circumstances when the community needs to
<br>
act as a whole. For a corporation, such circumstances are present at all
<br>
times. For a country, such circumstances could be a state of war with
<br>
another country.
<br>
<p>Naturally, the 'group entity' only behaves as a living thing, but it is
<br>
merely a system; it does not 'live' in the strict sense of the word. But if
<br>
something acts as if it is alive, then I see no reason to insist, like you
<br>
seem to, that it is &quot;_NOT_ alive, because I _DON'T_ want to see it as
<br>
something that is alive&quot;.
<br>
<p>We already have large numbers of such 'group entities', and they are of the
<br>
most ordinary kind - businesses, armies, and even entire countries. We all
<br>
actively participate in them - the only person I could think of that doesn't
<br>
participate in any 'group entity' would be someone living alone on an island
<br>
somewhere, with little or no interactions to any other human being.
<br>
<p>So, whether you accept it or not, you _are_ a part of a 'living' organism.
<br>
You are but a tiny cell in it. The organism takes care of you, and you make
<br>
your own tiny contributions to the organism. Actually, you most probably
<br>
actively participate in more than one such organism. As do I.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; It is not surprising that the idea of the sovereign individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is under assault even here in the US. The last century of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immigration by people infected by socialist memes to the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has created our culture war.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are starting to repeat yourself. Not only that, you seem to talk
<br>
about 'people infected with memes' as if you were totally free of them.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Man has natural rights because he has evolved under the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics and biology to be the creature he/she is.
</em><br>
<p>This statement makes 0 sense to me. I see no logical structure to it. It
<br>
sounds like &quot;man has rights because he is&quot;. Have you ever even defined what
<br>
the term 'rights' means?
<br>
<p>Perhaps we should start with that: if you disagree with the 'rights by
<br>
negotiation' definition that was proposed, why don't you come up with your
<br>
own definition of 'rights'? One that does not result in a circular
<br>
reference, preferrably.
