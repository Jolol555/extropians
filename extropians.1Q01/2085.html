<p><p>Many thanks to everyone who offered advice.
<br>
<p>If there's one aspect of HTML coding about which I can speak with 
<br>
authority, it's being a beginner. The HTML book I started out with spent 
<br>
the first chapter teaching the code. At the end of the chapter was a note 
<br>
saying: now that you know how to hand code, forget it. Get yourself a good 
<br>
HTML editor.
<br>
<p>I can see why it's useful to know what the code means so you can change it 
<br>
if you want to, but I can't see the point of tediously typing in each &lt;br&gt; 
<br>
and &lt;p&gt; and &lt;A HREF =...&gt;.  The problem I was having stemmed from using the 
<br>
MS Word built-in conversion from Word document to HTML, rather than from 
<br>
using Frontpage. I ended up solving the problem by converting the Word 
<br>
document to text-only, which got rid of the weird Word formatting, and then 
<br>
copying and pasting the text into Frontpage.
<br>
<p>I can't see why Frontpage homepages would look any different from homepages 
<br>
designed with any other HTML editor (or by hand, for that matter) unless 
<br>
one used Frontpage templates and themes. I started with blank pages, 
<br>
because none of the templates did what I wanted. I wonder if my pages have 
<br>
the Frontpage look and, if so, what elements contribute to this look. The 
<br>
homepage is at <a href="http://www.thespike.addr.com">http://www.thespike.addr.com</a>  Comments appreciated (maybe 
<br>
off-list). Thanks.
<br>
