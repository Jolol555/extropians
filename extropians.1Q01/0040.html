<p>Jason's response was wonderfully clever, but still left out some key
<br>
elements and finessed others. I think I should elaborate a little on why I
<br>
felt cheated by Eliezer's and Dale's meta-level `revelation'. 
<br>
<p>Purported koans of this kind are rather too close for my tastes to that
<br>
hoary deadener; `then she woke up, and it had all been a dream!' Well, no
<br>
shit. I discussed some of the implications of apparently self-subverting
<br>
paradoxa in THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS:
<br>
<p>=========
<br>
<p>...it must be asked whether the apparently divergent impulses of
<br>
referential, ideological and deconstructive analyses can be brought to a
<br>
common focus or shared account. A persuasive synthesis of the most telling
<br>
features of these disjoint approaches has been sketched by Christopher
<br>
Butler. Like many of the more interesting post-deconstructive discussions
<br>
of how we read, his synopsis is regulated by pragmatism:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For if the text has multiple implications... and if the interpreter can
<br>
also choose amongst structuralist, deconstructionist, Marxist, and liberal
<br>
moralist frameworks... then the apparent anarchy of pluralism can at least
<br>
be brought into some order, and lose its air of indifferentism, if we ask
<br>
that... interpreters should be as clear as possible about the ends for
<br>
which they interpret.&quot; (ibid., x)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Tellingly, *use* becomes the final arbiter. Yet `use' has application only
<br>
within a pre-established context of situation and ends. Language may be
<br>
made to turn on itself in search of fissures and aporias, but such
<br>
sceptical deconstructive play is inevitably grounded in the fact that
<br>
language is a social and socialising tool through which, in large part, we
<br>
humans are constituted as persons (`subjects'), and with which we
<br>
coordinate our physical and mental activities in the supraindividual
<br>
functions of our collectivity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those joint activities in turn may be construed as `texts', but it is
<br>
arguable that such texts are written in a metalanguage of higher logical
<br>
type not amenable to disruption from levels subordinate to their own.  (For
<br>
instance, the apparent paradox generated by a sign which states `Disregard
<br>
This Sign' vanishes when we see that the shifter particle `this' cannot
<br>
meaningfully be applied self-reflexively; it must gesture to a referent of
<br>
lower logical type. It makes perfect sense to write `Disregard this sign on
<br>
Sundays' if the words are followed by an injunction applying to all other
<br>
days, but that is because we see that `this' then refers to the injunction
<br>
thus denoted, not to the sign in toto. With the disappearance of the
<br>
oppressive sense of paradox, we can register the sign as a witty or parodic
<br>
demolition of authoritarian injunction).  If so, the best that can be done
<br>
is to make pragmatic choices, the terms of which are declared within
<br>
superordinate systems.
<br>
<p>==================================
<br>
<p>My pragmatic choice, in the context of Eliezer's alleged meta-riddle, is to
<br>
demand: show me the money.
<br>
<p>Elsewhere in that book I note:
<br>
<p>===========================
<br>
<p>What is clear is that the sound of one hand clapping - that traditional
<br>
aporetic poser for the novice seeking enlightenment - is (hilariously, and
<br>
viciously) the ringing you hear when your exasperated sensei whacks you in
<br>
the ear. We stop getting slapped, we no longer hear that transcendental
<br>
sound, the moment we communicate to the sensei that we have leaped beyond
<br>
this necessary cruelty. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But surely this fable, too, merely assumes a supine, subordinate
<br>
relationship: to the sensei's wisdom (which is only doxa passed along from
<br>
history), to an arbitrary calculus of the universe, to our hungry desire
<br>
for paradox. All frames of discussion are frozen music, the sound of one
<br>
hand clapping, stilled. The general paradigm of language-exchanges as a
<br>
semiotic calculus, articulated in this book by analogy with the Jakobson
<br>
communication circuit, is doubtless deconstructable as will-to-power. Such
<br>
desire for totality is always vitiated in advance (deconstruction tries to
<br>
convince us, fudging the syntagmatic truth) by the teemingly untestable
<br>
fecundity of alternative readings. But in the moment that we see - grasp,
<br>
hear, touch, sniff out - this partial truth, we escape the thrall of the
<br>
sensei who slaps our poor stinging ears. Then all the hard work remains to
<br>
be done anyway.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not embrace either paradox or ordered structure for the zest of it,
<br>
though their embrace is zestful, but as a tool. A tool is used for a job. A
<br>
job is a practice in our twinned world: the empirical world of the Real,
<br>
which is what we bark our shins on however we care to describe it, and the
<br>
symbolic world of culture and subjectivity. Knowing that we call upon
<br>
paradox to do a job, or try to resolve what appears to be a paradox to get
<br>
a job done, emphasises the pragmatic dimension which is always part of any
<br>
analysis. 
<br>
<p>============================
<br>
<p>*deconstructable as will-to-power* - do you hear me, Grasshopper?
