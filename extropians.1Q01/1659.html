<p><em>&gt;When you're done with radioactive materials, you can shoot some of them

</em><br>
<p>Argonne National Labs near Chicago was within a year of demonstration of a 
<br>
commercial fast breeder / reprocessing plant / intrinsically safe reactor - 
<br>
the IFR project - when Mr. Klinton rose to power. His administration 
<br>
cancelled the project with cancellation costs greater than the balance of 
<br>
the program's estimated completion costs - and without any results.
<br>
<p>The IFR would have provided clean, safe nuclear power, with no long term 
<br>
storage of wastes, as the spent fuel is reprocessed on site and any fission 
<br>
products neutron irradiated on site to quickly degenerate them into 
<br>
short-lived isotopes. The plan was for a plant to operate for 25 or 30 
<br>
years on one fueling, then be sealed for the next 100 years or so to allow 
<br>
the remaining radiation to die off. What would have been left would have 
<br>
been classified &quot;low level&quot; wastes.
<br>
<p>Launching anything through the atmosphere - raw ore, processed fuel, or 
<br>
wastes - carries with it the real risk that the launch will fail and the 
<br>
payload will be scattered a'la Challenger.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; We're talking about electrical equipment, I wonder what the order is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; consumption of these products:  green pc, green monitor, iron, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electric stovetop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; range, electric furnace, stereo, large television, 100W light bulb, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishwasher,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; microwave.  These are some typical home products.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here's a guess:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;oven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;iron
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lighbulb
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large television
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stereo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;green monitor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;green pc
</em><br>
<p>Actually, you have this in order of current draw, not energy consumption. A 
<br>
5000 watt oven operated for one half hour every day uses 2.5 kWh of energy. 
<br>
The TV which draws 75 watts, but is on ten hours per day uses 750 Wh. A 
<br>
'green&quot; PC that is on 24/7 may use much more energy than the iron, for 
<br>
instance, since the iron is a very intermittently used device.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We talk about decentralized power, but if there was one big fusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tokamak then it could support a large grid.
</em><br>
<p>And then one little failure or terrorist attack could black out everything. 
<br>
Centralization is fine for some ideas, but death for power generation.
<br>
<p>If It turns out that fusion is only practical in huge sizes, we need to 
<br>
make everything at least duplicated, if not quintuple, to avoid such problems.
