Subject: Alcor Neuro-Vitrification Procedure Yesterday, and Thanks to 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>In a recent post, I mentioned, &quot;At this time, it appears nearly certain
<br>
that a second neurovitrification will take place before the end of the
<br>
year.&quot; At the time that post went out, the suspension was actually in
<br>
progress.  As of 2:00 a.m. this morning, our second neuro
<br>
cryovitrification procedure of this month was into cooldown, having
<br>
achieved the necessary levels of cryoprotection with freeze blockers to
<br>
give us high confidence that most of the brain will cryovitrify.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The qualification &quot;most of the brain&quot; relates to the fact that this Alcor
<br>
Member was a mid-forties gal who was struck by a pickup truck while
<br>
walking her dog along an icy road in the northern part of the U.S., remote
<br>
from all large cities.  It happened virtually in front of her house, and
<br>
her husband, also an Alcor Member, was at her side immediately.  Being
<br>
well known cryonicists in the area, they were able to get the Coroner to
<br>
come immediately to the accident site, and by the time he arrived only a
<br>
few minutes later, the husband was speaking on his cell phone with Jerry
<br>
Lemler, M.D., Alcor's Medical Director who is on the verge of moving to
<br>
Arizona to take over this role on a full time basis. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As the Coroner stepped from his car, the husband was able to literally
<br>
&quot;hand the cell phone&quot; to the Coroner, who found himself talking with a
<br>
M.D., with the result that immediate release and waiver of autopsy was
<br>
achieved, and good cooperation with the local hospital was obtained, with
<br>
administration of heparin (anti-coagulant medication) and continuation of
<br>
cooling.  In several recent suspensions, we have found that immediate
<br>
intervention by an Alcor M.D. has &quot;turned the tide&quot; in what otherwise
<br>
could have been a tragic defeat of the Members' purpose in being a member
<br>
of Alcor. (Alcor now has three M.D.'s who are trained in both surgery as
<br>
well as rescue coordination skills, and will continue to expand this
<br>
participation as more M.D.'s join Alcor and help to &quot;spread the load&quot;.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Delays in surface and air transportation, particularly due to heavy
<br>
Holiday traffic, brought about a 30+ hour delay, prior to surgery at Alcor
<br>
Central. Notwithstanding this, new surgical procedures, combined with far
<br>
more effective cryoprotective agents and freeze blockers, permitted brain
<br>
washout and cryoprotection beyond any levels that would have been possible
<br>
before.  (Immediate intervention by an Alcor M.D. was a critical link
<br>
also, as already mentioned).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
One very synergistic aspect was that extensive consulting, coaching and
<br>
advice were provided, during the procedure, by the same science team that
<br>
had developed the new cryoprotective agents and freeze blockers.  The
<br>
availability to Alcor of in-depth knowledge of the physiology of
<br>
cryoprotection, adjusted to this particular case, was invaluable, helping
<br>
us to provide the utmost possible level of brain protection for an Alcor
<br>
Member who had suffered a totally unexpected termination of her first life
<br>
cycle. It also gives additional confidence to the rest of us that we can
<br>
&quot;go to higher levels&quot; in aiding other Alcor Members who might encounter
<br>
similar threats to irrecoverable loss of their lives, in the future.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
More details will be reported in future issues of Cryonics Magazine (we
<br>
hope to have some of these articles in the Alcor website before long, and
<br>
will announce this on CryoNet as it happens).  We are looking forward to
<br>
the day when the research that underlies these new vitrification
<br>
procedures have been reported in the scientific literature, so that we can
<br>
give a better sense of the underlying science to those who want to
<br>
understand it. Despite this limitation, we have (with the in-depth aid of
<br>
the scientists involved) recently published a necessarily limited account
<br>
of the new procedures in Cryonics Magazine, and that article (lacking the
<br>
graphics at this point) is already available on the Alcor Website (take
<br>
the &quot;News and Events&quot; link), at: <a href="http://www.alcor.org/eventsb.html">http://www.alcor.org/eventsb.html</a>.
