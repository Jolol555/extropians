<p>I would recommend that everyone become at least comfortable with guns. 
<br>
Knowledge is never a bad thing. After you learn to shoot, it is hard to 
<br>
fall victim to the mindless millions who demonize guns - you will know 
<br>
better. Safety training is a must, of course.
<br>
<p>The gun is the great equalizer for those persons who cannot spend years 
<br>
becoming proficient at martial arts. To learn pistol well enough for self 
<br>
defense is a matter of weeks, not years. Handicapped persons can use a 
<br>
handgun when they are confined to a wheelchair, for instance. The mere 
<br>
demonstration that one is prepared to use deadly force to defend oneself is 
<br>
often sufficient to end a threatening situation - especially where there 
<br>
are many attackers, such as a gang attack in an urban area.
<br>
<p>Most large urban areas have a pistol range or three, and most of these 
<br>
offer rentals of popular models. Some have training classes regularly, or 
<br>
can get you in touch with NRA certified instructors.
<br>
<p>I would recommend a .22 revolver or pistol as a first personal gun. It's 
<br>
not the best thing for self defense, but you will learn the basics, and the 
<br>
ammo is dirt cheap. For personal defense, I would recommend at least a .38 
<br>
caliber revolver, or a 9mm pistol, as the minimum that gives real &quot;stopping 
<br>
power&quot; against an attacker. Beware of &quot;cheap&quot; brands, such as Lorcin or 
<br>
Jennings - they tend to fall apart and become unsafe in short order.
<br>
<p>Happy shooting!
<br>
