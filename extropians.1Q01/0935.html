Scientists Create First Genetically Modified Primate
<br>
Baby Rhesus Monkey, Nicknamed ANDi, Carries Extra DNA 
<br>
<p>By WILLIAM McCALL
<br>
.c The Associated Press
<br>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore. (Jan. 11) - Researchers have created the world's first 
<br>
genetically modified primate, a baby rhesus monkey whose name - ANDi - stands 
<br>
for ''inserted DNA'' spelled backward.
<br>
<p>Born in October, the male monkey carries a tiny extra bit of DNA in a gene 
<br>
introduced as a marker that can be seen under a microscope because it glows 
<br>
green, researchers at Oregon Health Sciences University said.
<br>
<p>ANDi's creation was described in the Friday issue of the journal Science.
<br>
<p>Researchers hope they now can introduce other genes in rhesus monkeys that 
<br>
could trigger a host of human diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, breast 
<br>
cancer or HIV, allowing experiments to block them at the genetic level.
<br>
<p>The technique for inserting the gene has been used for more than a quarter 
<br>
century in mice, but comparing a mouse to a human being has limits, said Dr. 
<br>
Gerald Schatten. He is leading the research at the university's Oregon 
<br>
Regional Primate Center.
<br>
<p>Because monkeys are close genetic cousins to humans, they may give scientists 
<br>
a better picture of how human disease develops, he said.
<br>
<p>''I think we're at an extraordinary moment in the history of humans,'' 
<br>
Schatten said Wednesday.
<br>
<p>Others were quick to condemn the research.
<br>
<p>Dr. Ray Greek, spokesman for the Physicians Committee for Responsible 
<br>
Medicine, said the disease research can be already done at the cellular level.
<br>
<p>''I think it's going to get them a lot of press and will eventually translate 
<br>
into getting OHSU a lot of money,'' Greek said.
<br>
<p>''But 20 years from now, will your children be safer from cancer, heart 
<br>
disease, etc., as a result of this? The odds are astronomically against it.''
<br>
<p>Dr. Phyllis Leppert at the National Institutes of Health, which funded the 
<br>
research, defended the monkey gene modification.
<br>
<p>She said the NIH and scientists have been dealing with genetic research 
<br>
issues for decades, and Schatten - like other scientists who work with 
<br>
primates - are always trying to balance the use of animals with the prospect 
<br>
of curing a disease.
<br>
<p>''All of this research is being done very carefully with all of the 
<br>
scientific community giving him input,'' Leppert said.
<br>
<p>Schatten said the modification should help researchers find cures for human 
<br>
diseases faster, eventually ending the need to use animals.
<br>
<p>He also said the technique will limit the number of monkeys needed because 
<br>
test animals can be genetically designed, eliminating the need to create a 
<br>
large pool of test animals in hopes that one will have the desired 
<br>
characteristics.
<br>
<p>''Researchers around the world believe that a lot of diseases like cancers, 
<br>
like mental illnesses, like diabetes and other degenerative diseases could 
<br>
actually be cured, and cured within just a few years,'' Schatten said.
<br>
<p>''I don't think any of us would want to make primates sick unless it would 
<br>
truly accelerate the day that diseases can be eradicated.''
<br>
<p>A year ago, Schatten reported the first monkey successfully cloned by embryo 
<br>
splitting. That monkey is named Tetra. ANDi and his surrogate mother, as well 
<br>
as Tetra, remain healthy, Schatten said.
<br>
<p>ANDi received an extra gene while he was still an unfertilized egg.
<br>
<p>Schatten, lead author Anthony W.S. Chan and other researchers modified and 
<br>
then fertilized more than 200 rhesus monkey eggs. Forty embryos were 
<br>
produced, and resulted in five pregnancies and three live births. Of the 
<br>
three baby monkeys, only ANDi proved to have the modified genes.
<br>
<p>Greek, an author and physician, remained skeptical.
<br>
<p>''We have been doing to mice for 20 to 30 years what they have done with 
<br>
ANDi,'' he said, ''and we have been singularly unsuccessful, especially in 
<br>
cancer research.''
<br>
<p>Terry Lomax, an Oregon State University plant geneticist who has dealt with 
<br>
similar issues over genetically modified food, said the issue is going to 
<br>
keep getting more attention.
<br>
<p>''But I think people will be a little more fearful because monkeys are a 
<br>
little closer to home,'' she said. ''That's why it's good to have a public 
<br>
dialogue.''
