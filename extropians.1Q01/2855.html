<br>
most French &quot;intellectuals&quot; are conformist windbags.  Interesting excerpt:  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Russell,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a French movie starring Jeanne Moreau on the Opheus (spelling) 
<br>
theme and I believe that word is in the title only.  It is B&amp;W with a 
<br>
thirties feel to it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That movie is absolutely fascinating and a favorite of mine.  However, be 
<br>
warned I am fascinated by trying to figure out what the hell is going on and 
<br>
trying to decide if little action shown is preliminary to something happening.
<br>
