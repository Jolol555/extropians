<p>
To All of The Above:
<br>
<p>I'm plagued by my record.  I look myself on Search engines and find my past e-mail messages full of ranting and raving.
<br>
<p>In any case, I was discussing my Uncle Mark Howard Riegel on the Extropian mailing list on the night before he died.  I was complaining about health care and poverty and financial scarcity.
<br>
<p>I made threatening comments about cannibalizing Bill Gates and his family.
<br>
<p>I'm sorry for that.  But, finally, I have gotten my Uncle Mark's album, Live in Lompoc, on the net.
<br>
<p>You'll need a 128K or faster net connection to listen to it.
<br>
<p>It's MP3 format.  You should have WinAmp or an MP3 player installed.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your tolerance of all my diverse moods and personalities.
<br>
<p>I still would like to go to &quot;Marlene's Market and Deli&quot; and ask politely and quietly for &quot;a joint&quot; then go home and smoke it while doing graphics artwork on my home computer.
<br>
<p>Thank you.
<br>

<br>
<p>Does anyone out there have a joint they could mail me?  Please.  I just want to relax.
