<em>&gt; It was published last Monday, Feb. 12.  A passage from the Introduction (pp. 10-12):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I was haunted by a question whose answer had long eluded historians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Germans always had the lists of Jewish names...  But how did the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazis get the lists?  For decades, no one has known.  Few have asked...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I confronted the reality of IBM's involvement one day in 1993 in Washington
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the United States Holocaust Museum.  There, in the very first exhibit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an IBM Hollerith D-11 card sorting machine... was permanently displayed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clearly affixed to the machine's front panel glistened an IBM nameplate...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [A]lthough 15 million people, including most major Holocaust experts, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen the display, and in spite of the best efforts of leading Museum historians,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more was understood about the provocative display other than the brief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curator's description at the exhibit and a few pages of supportive research...
</em><br>
<p>Frankly I find this to be rather a lame sort of blamology. IBM was not the only maker of card sorters in that
<br>
day, and IBM card sorters were also of immense importance to the Enigma decoding programs at Bletchley Park, as
<br>
well as Richard Feynman's work on doing calculations for the Manhattan Project.
<br>
<p>Blaming a technology or its manufacturer a cheap and lame game to play. For example, when Hitler took power,
<br>
the only manufacturer of Luger semi-automatic pistols was a Jewish owned firm, which was confiscated from them.
<br>
Should the Jews who had owned that firm be blamed for the many Jews who were shot by SS officers with those
<br>
pistols they made for them prior to the Nazi takeover? Its rather ludicrous to play the blame game to this
<br>
extent, and implicating IBM for the Holocaust is of the same scope.
