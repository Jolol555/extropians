<p><em>&gt;Contrast this with what you see in classically low-trust groups that lack

sees 
<br>

</em><br>
<p>I noticed an impressive example of high-trust in that paragon of progress,
<br>
Silicon Valley.  When I was there in the mid-90's, I would see people line up
<br>
their cars over a mile on the shoulder of the northbound 101, waiting to 
<br>
make the turn onto the eastbound Dunbarton bridge.  &quot;Cheaters&quot; could
<br>
stay in the right lane of the freeway and get into line just before the 
<br>
turnoff.
<br>
I know, because that's what I did the first time I drove it.  Nonetheless,
<br>
obviously most people did it, because otherwise there'd have been an
<br>
equally long line in the right lane.  I thought it was very gracious, as it 
<br>
kept an entire mile of traffic off the freeway.   I was happy to join in
<br>
the line afterwards.
<br>
<p>I've never seen anything like that in metro LA.  On several occaisions when
<br>
I've participated in something like that, I end up barely moving, as cheaters
<br>
come as quickly as the bottleneck lets cars through.  Ain't just a feeling,
<br>
it's reality.
