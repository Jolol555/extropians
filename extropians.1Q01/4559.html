<em>&gt;The Supreme Court satisfied the 'flipping the coin' part, by deciding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that Gore cheated by trying to change the coin to a two headed one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mid-toss, so Bush won by default.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, I wouldn't have minded much if they had duelled, tho I 'spect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gore woulda demanded three people as seconds, bragged that he invented
</em><br>
<em>&gt;duelling and thus gets to decide the rules AFTER having walked ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paces, denied the referee had any controlling and legal authority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tipper would have demanded that videos of the duel carry warning labels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gore would have denied ever having smoked a barrel ('cept maybe once),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the press would have declared Gore the winner before a shot was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
And George W. would have demanded the guns his father bought, and then not shown up for the duel, and insisted that he had (kinda like the national guard).  And we all know who's snort snot would be found on the barrels.
