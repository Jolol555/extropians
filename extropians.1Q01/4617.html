<p>Generally true, but ...
<br>
<p>We're seeing at least one example, today, of an entire industry being
<br>
driven to the brink by improvements in its own efficiency and competition
<br>
on price. Agriculture!
<br>
<p>Here in the EU, price supports have begun to collapse over the past couple
<br>
of years. (Those supports, at least in the UK, were originally intended
<br>
to provide for self-sufficiency in time of war -- talk about learning the
<br>
lessons of WW2!)  Agricultural produce prices are falling, and it turns
<br>
out that we can't easily support an agricultural sector at all. Only about
<br>
2% of the population in the UK is directly involved in food production
<br>
(but produce roughly 50% of the food required by the entire population).
<br>
Go back 200 years and it took 80% of the population to produce 100% of
<br>
the food required. That's a huge improvement in efficiency ... but the
<br>
farmers are having horrendous difficulties making ends meet, because of
<br>
the continuous downward pressure on food prices.
<br>
<p>(Note that price supports in France serve a radically different purpose
<br>
from the UK -- France has this tradition of rural living, the ideal of
<br>
the peasant farmer as a way of life to aspire to, and the cottage in
<br>
the country with its own kitchen garden -- which puts different social
<br>
pressures on the system.)
<br>
<p>A fundamental problem is that people *can't* physically consume much more
<br>
food; obesity levels are rising, but the main source of new money going
<br>
into foodstuffs is spending on luxury goods, prepared items, imported
<br>
exotica, and so on. Everyone can afford to eat, and most people can afford
<br>
to eat what by 1950 standards would be considered a luxury diet. We've got
<br>
the most intensive, industrialised agricultural system in the EU, but it's
<br>
competing with third world banana economies -- it can't bring in enough 
<br>
money to operate effectively. 
<br>
<p>If we posit a world in which regional economic imbalances have flattened
<br>
out, we'll eventually hit a point where downward pressure on food prices
<br>
can't go any further because if it does there'll be insufficient money to
<br>
pay for food production -- but consumption os flat. If food is produced
<br>
at cost, in sufficient quantity and quality for everyone, there is *no*
<br>
further room for growth (other than through artificially-induced fashions
<br>
and fads, which offer transient relief through manufactured scarcity).
<br>
<p>What happens then?
