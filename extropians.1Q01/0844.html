The only thing which distinguishes a nuke

<p>Well, actually, there's density--or atomic weight, if
<br>
you will. Now of course, lead shielding is quite
<br>
likely to screw this up--but the lead shielding would
<br>
have only some easily penetrable covering--wood, thin
<br>
metal, etc.--both of which can be &quot;seen through&quot; with
<br>
current technologies, though mind you I'm not saying
<br>
that can (or can't) be done by satellite. Simply
<br>
detecting lead shielding would be a tip-off, depending
<br>
upon context. So, just to throw another wild Q--might
<br>
it be possible to pick it up that way--detection of
<br>
heavy elements in unusual places? Some tech analogous
<br>
to GPR, perhaps? (Though yes, I realize GPR itself is
<br>
unsuitable.)

<p>Wouldn't miss the opportunity. I've always thought it
<br>
better ask and learn than dwell in silent ignorance.
<br>
<p>How about you?

&gt; No. Nor do we have to, since elementary physics
&gt; suffices. The only thing which distinguishes a nuke
&gt; from anything else is radiation, a passive property.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is being emitted from behind a shield on a 
&gt; noisy background, and has a distance of some 100 km 
&gt; filled with atmosphere between source and detector. 
&gt; Plus, you have a lot of terrain to cover, so you
&gt; can't
&gt; look for very long.
&gt; 
&gt; On such a distance you have a much better chance
&gt; seeing the infrared emission from the nuke surface,
&gt; which is (at best) few degrees K above background. 
&gt; Which is just as silly.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; @It wouldn't really have to, would it? There are
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; clues, such as disturbance of air molecules by
&gt; passing
&gt; &gt; gamma particles--which of course, absent a
&gt; detonation,
&gt; 
&gt; Um, gamma quanta are not special. There are a lot of
&gt; hot 
&gt; nuclei around here, and see the cosmic ray
&gt; background. 
&gt; You would should be able to detect a nuke with it's
&gt; nitrogen-rich
&gt; high explosive shell around it from a few m
&gt; distance, but
&gt; that's about it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; are feeble. Can such things be detected from a
&gt; great
&gt; &gt; distance? I don't know. Can Hubble be turned
&gt; around to
&gt; &gt; look down here? Good chance.
&gt; 
&gt; If you insist in making a fool out of yourself in a
&gt; public 
&gt; place, be my guest.
