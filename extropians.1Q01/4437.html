<em>&gt;**With the possible exception of religious fundamentalists, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no other community as blindly intolerant of new ideas as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientific community. None. Nada. Zippo. Zilch.
</em><br>
<p>My first response to this: we seem to live in different worlds.
<br>
I find the scientists _very open_ to new ideas. Are we interacting
<br>
with different age groups, perhaps?
<br>
<p>Question: what is the typical age group of the scientists that you
<br>
have had contact with?
<br>
<p>The older they are, the less flexible they are in their thinking.
<br>
(This is true of many people, however, not just scientists.)
<br>
The older folks are also the ones more often in the public view.
<br>
<p>i said:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I find these phrases antagonistic and a complete disconnect with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; my knowledge and experience. I've been in the sciences 20 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and I've yet to encounter another scientist who treats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nonscientists with this kind of scorn, as you describe above.
</em><br>
you:
<br>
<em>&gt;**Well, that could be because they're treating YOU as a colleague.
</em><br>
<p>Or if they don't treat me well, then they won't get their data reduced...
<br>
(ok ok joking....)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Were you in the company of nonscientists who were complete strangers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with no knowlege of the disciplines?
</em><br>
<p>Occasionally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Or maybe you just hang out with nice guys.
</em><br>
<p>Or perhaps a selection effect?
<br>
<p>If I find myself in a work environment that has large factors against
<br>
me, then eventually I leave. No different than people in other
<br>
fields.
<br>
<p>In my ~8 scientific research groups, in the last 20 years:
<br>
<p>2/3 optimal ('friendly' group, great working conditions etc.)
<br>
<p>1/3 suboptimal (supervisors with unscrupulous behavior or sexist
<br>
attitude or unpleasant disposition, so I eventually left)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;**Actually,  the 'secret knowledge' thing is Gould's.
</em><br>
<p>Was he joking?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The 'unwashed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;masses' is mine. The same principle is at work with cops and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious leaders: Knowledge is power, and power shared is power lost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is why cops fight open public access to public records,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and why the Church conducted masses in  Latin and hated Gutenberg.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds to me like an entrenched and old-thinking perspective.
<br>
<p>Your choice of words is sometimes inflammatory. If you describe
<br>
scientists with those words, then you'll probably find some or many
<br>
reacting with some hostility to you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;**I've not met many scientists I truly disliked, though I've read
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(and read of) a good number of insufferable ones with the decidedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unscientific attitude that &quot;If the facts don't fit the theory, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must be disposed of.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>In my view, that is an unscrupulous attitude, and I couldn't accept it.
<br>
I have not had personal experience with any scientist who had the
<br>
above approach to science, however, although I'm sure that it exists.
<br>
(but rarely)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Before you say it ain't so, consider plate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tectonics as but a single well-documented example. More recently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you've got people with pet theories threatening to deny telescope
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time to people with conflicting theories--whose time on those devices
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could disprove the pet theories.
</em><br>
<p>There will always be disagreements among scientists with incongruous
<br>
theories. There will always be disagreements among nonscientists
<br>
with incongruous philosophies. The disagreements may not always
<br>
be handled in the most principled way. Why single out the scientists?
<br>
<p>Regarding 'pet theories':
<br>
<p>Scientists occassionally (or more than occassionally) receive in the
<br>
mail pet theories from strangers in the public. I've received a few
<br>
of them myself. I'm far more open to considering the idea, if the
<br>
writer spent a fair amount of time (months, years) thinking of the
<br>
concept, learning of the basic physics involved, and learning
<br>
something of the historical background, than if the writer dashed
<br>
off the note while eating breakfast one morning, based on a dream
<br>
the night before. I wouldn't respond to the latter, while I would
<br>
probably at least carefully think about what the former person
<br>
wrote.
<br>
<p>I've witnessed scientists bending over backwards to help prove
<br>
or disprove pet theories, by the way. The Mars Pathfinder team,
<br>
for example, made a special set of observations of the area known
<br>
on Mars as &quot;The Face&quot;. These observations didn't sway the pet theory
<br>
proponents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;**&quot;All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evident.&quot; -- Arthur Schopenhauer
</em><br>
<p>There are different possibilities of stages that truth passes
<br>
through,the above is only one possibility.
<br>
<p>I think that the best thing that the scientist can give to the
<br>
nonscientist is _not_ plain facts and answers, but instead, to
<br>
instill a sense of curiosity and wonder and awe, to aid the person
<br>
in thinking on their own, about the possibilities of humans in our
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.&quot;
<br>
--Voltaire
<br>
<p>&quot;You cannot teach a man anything, you can only help him to find it
<br>
for himself.&quot;    --Galileo Galilei
<br>
<p>&quot;That's the whole problem with science. You've got a bunch of
<br>
empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder.&quot;
<br>
--Calvin (&amp; Hobbes)
<br>
<p>&quot;The universe is not only queerer than we supppose, but queerer than
<br>
we can suppose.&quot; -J.B.S. Haldane
<br>
<p>&quot;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is
<br>
the source of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a
<br>
stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe,
<br>
is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.&quot;   --Einstein
