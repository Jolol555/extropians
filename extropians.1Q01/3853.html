Or... Costumes as PR.
<br>
<p>From: Spike Jones &lt;<a href="mailto:spike66@attglobal.net?Subject=Re:%20silliness:%20%20was%20m-brain%20related%20physics&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110701b6af5c5bc85f@[145.253.82.213]&gt;">spike66@attglobal.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Oh, yes, the costume contest.  The &quot;Sisters&quot; of Perpetual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Motion showed up, one of which is said to be an actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;woman, but no one knows which.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A woman in a white dress had every favorite thing physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attached to her person: door bells and sleigh bells, wild geese,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cream colored ponies, even schnitzel with noodles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A group of men and women dressed in curtains.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<p>The great thing about costumes, is that it's a humorous way to
<br>
introduce radical ideas. People can think about it, while they
<br>
are also laughing at it. No one is scowling, you see. Great PR.
<br>
<p>So choosing a costume:   1) Obscure/Educational or 2) Silly  ?
<br>
<p>1) If you choose one that is obscure and abstract, it's sort of a
<br>
hassle to need to explain it to those folks you meet.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, with obscure costumes, you then have the other(s)
<br>
attention to tell them what it's about.
<br>
<p>In October 1997, I dressed up as a Cassini RTG unit for my Halloween
<br>
costume. As you may remember, Cassini was launched that month, amid
<br>
huge demonstrations about the safety of the RTG units.
<br>
<p>My costume was a bit abstract because I was unsuccessful in finding
<br>
a large silver cylinder in the Stanford trash bins to fit around a
<br>
human body. The largest I could find was one that I fit over my arm.
<br>
Then I painted radioactive-glowing-blue on my face and colored my
<br>
hair green and put sparkly things all over the rest of me.
<br>

<br>
<p>Even with the words: &quot;RTG&quot; on the aluminum tube and &quot;Cassini&quot;
<br>
written in big letters acrosss my torso, folks _still_ couldn't
<br>
figure out what I supposed to be.  They thought that I was some sort
<br>
of space fairy.
<br>
<p>However this was a hip crowd (cypherpunks) who had a good grasp of
<br>
the scientific issues and risk factors regarding the RTGs and, as
<br>
soon as I told them what I was, they had a good laugh about my
<br>
politically incorrect costume. I needed to give very little
<br>
explanation after that.
<br>
<p><p>2) Or you can go for the big and obvious and silly shock option,
<br>
which is simply fun.
<br>
<p>Spike, I see you decided to go for the ......
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So I was in the costume shop and they had an SNL
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conehead thing, and I got an idea.  Take some pine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cones, cut off the, um, thingies that pine cones have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on em, put on the conehead getup and glue these thingies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all over it and all over my face.  Hang a sign around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my neck with arrows pointing upwards and the words
</em><br>
<em>&gt;^ MARIA SIT HERE ^
</em><br>
<p><p>Silly option.  :-)
