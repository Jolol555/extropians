Interesting points re: partial deregulation not being
<br>
better than no deregulation at all.

<em>&gt;HALF A LOAF SPOILS THE SOUP: The Problem With Phony Deregulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Copyright © 2001 by United Press International
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Back when the failures of socialism were numerous and obvious, the free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;market seemed like a readily available solution.  Rather than let the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government try to set prices, either for its own enterprises, or private
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ones it regulated, all that was needed was to either privatize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;business, if it was government-owned, or deregulate it, if it were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already private.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;After two decades of privatization and deregulation, real and phony, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can now look back and learn from the various successes and failures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And what we learn is that half a loaf, in deregulation, is not better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than none.   Privatization and deregulation are both intended to result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the creation of a competitive private marketplace where several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competing service providers have better access to capital (and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better, more modern facilities) and better, cheaper service.  Taxpaying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies with soaring stock prices and happy customers replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tax-absorbing white elephants with dissatisfied consumers.  What we find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that when these processes are well-designed and well-executed, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work, and these benefits are created.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, the past two decades of market reform attempts have also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;created some enormous messes.  The California power blackout, a direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;result of a botched deregulation scheme, is only the most recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example.  Other such messes include the British railway privatization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scheme, the S&amp;L scandal, and aspects of the American air transport
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system and American telephone divestiture.  Each of these in turn has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been held up as an example of the failure of deregulation or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;privatization; in fact, when you look at them, what they each illustrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is political failure, not market failure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In California, some dim bulb (so to speak) had the amazing concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deregulating the prices power companies would have to pay to power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppliers for their power, without deregulating the price at which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could sell power to consumers.  They were supposed to make it up by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;charging more to business customers, so that, in effect, businesses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(ultimately) their customers would subsidize the cost of energy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consumers.  (This is exactly how phone service works in the US today).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfortunately, this stealth tax did not work (partly because businesses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just did not buy a large enough percentage of the power used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;California) and the power companies are going bankrupt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In Britain, the sluggish and perennially money-losing nationalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;railway system was privatized in the early Nineties.  However, it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;privatized in an ingenious way, which proved to be a little too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ingenious.  The track was given to one nationwide company to operate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the trains were contracted out to a series of regional operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies.  The operating companies paid tolls to the track company.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfortunately, what ended up happening was very similar to the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem with American telephone deregulation.  The local companies were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still monopolies, and the split of responsibilities in what was once a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unified system allowed each company to blame the other for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems.  Every American telephone consumer has gone through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frustrating experience of having the repairman say &quot;that’s an inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wire problem, not an outside wire problem&quot; (and therefore not our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem at all).  British rail passengers have started to hear &quot;It’s a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;track problem&quot; from the train companies, and in reply &quot;It’s a train
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem&quot; from the track companies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is most likely is that neither system, designed by judges and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politicians, was anything like what the market would have produced if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had never been regulated or nationalized.  America probably would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had three or four nationwide, competing telephone systems each offering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what the customer really wants: a total, end-to-end solution including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;local and long-distance service with decent maintenance.  Britain would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably have had two nationwide, competing rail systems organized in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the conventional manner: the company that runs the trains also maintains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the track, and is held responsible for everything.  Even Amtrak
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrates the logic of this solution:  its service in the Northeast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Corridor, where it owns its own tracks, is substantially more reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than elsewhere, where it runs on tracks belonging to freight railroads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even more subtle are cases where most people don’t realize that part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a system has not been deregulated or denationalized, because they don’t
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think of it as a system.  When the US savings and loan system was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deregulated, most people were not aware that the other half of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system, the deposit insurance system, was still nationalized, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essence gave the S&amp;Ls the equivalent of a blank check from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taxpayers.  Similarly, when airlines were deregulated in the US, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other two parts of the air transportation system, namely the air traffic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control system and the airports, were left in the hands of government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The airlines did their part well ? they delivered many more flights at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much lower fares.  The government-owned parts of the system utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;failed to keep pace.  This failure is at the root of almost all airline
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems today, including the difficulty of establishing new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competition, due to the lack of gate space and takeoff slots, both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationed by government.  Meanwhile, privatization of airports (as in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Britain) and air traffic control (as in Switzerland) has been a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Politicians everywhere are finding privatization and deregulation a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convenient scapegoat for their own failures.  But only if people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stupid enough to fall for their lame explanations.  Let’s hope the Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Administration ends the game of supposed &quot;deregulation&quot; without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accountability.
