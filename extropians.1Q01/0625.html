<p>Thats right. Too many so-called 'independent and balanced thinkers' are
<br>
either people without principles, ever bending to the perception of
<br>
current short term self interest or  else they are so co-dependent that
<br>
they are quite happy to let public opinion do their thinking for them. 
<br>
<p>Yes, some here call me an extremist. I am a principled man, I try to
<br>
live intentionally, not due to opportunity or utility. Too many have
<br>
fought and died defending or attempting to obtain the principles which I
<br>
hold dearly for me to take them lightly or for granted. Too many today
<br>
seek to destroy these principles for me to stand by watching. This is
<br>
not extremism, it is responsibility. 
<br>
<p>I could easily say that those who call me extremist are themselves
<br>
extremists: they take their alleged disinterest or moderation to
<br>
extremes. Those who claim to be 'moderate' are those 'good men' referred
<br>
to that permit evil to flourish because they do nothing. Now, Joe,
<br>
according to his posts, has been pretty courageous in defending abortion
<br>
rights, no doubt about it. Some may say he's a bit of an extremist about
<br>
it. I would hope that such a person could be similarly courageous about
<br>
other issues in life... rather than being extremely and obsessively
<br>
moderate while demonizing others who feel as passionately about 2nd
<br>
amendment rights as he does about a woman's 9th amendment right.
