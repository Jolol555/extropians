<em>&gt; &gt;  Before you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  claim to be a champion of free thought,  tell me: Why did political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  correctness originate on America's  campuses?  And why do you continue to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  tolerate it?  Why do you, who're  supposed to debate ideas, surrender to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  their suppression?  Let's be  honest.  Who here thinks your professors can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  say what they really  believe?  It scares me to death, and should scare you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  too, that the  superstition of political correctness rules the halls of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  reason.  You are  the best and the brightest.  You, here in the fertile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  cradle of American  academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  River, you  are the  cream.  But I submit that you, and your counterparts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  across the  land,  are the most socially conformed and politically silenced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  generation  since  Concord Bridge.  And as long as you validate that ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  and abide it ...you  are  - by your grandfathers' standards - cowards.
</em><br>
snip
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  But what can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  do?  How can anyone prevail  against such pervasive social subjugation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  The answer's been here all  along.  I learned it 36 years ago, on the steps of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  the Lincoln Memorial in  Washington D.C., standing with Dr. Martin Luther
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  King and two hundred  thousand people.  You simply ... disobey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Peaceably, yes.  Respectfully,  of course.  Nonviolently, absolutely.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  when  told how to think or what to  say or how to behave, we don't.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  disobey  social protocol that stifles and  stigmatizes personal freedom. 
</em><br>
<p>Does this sound like someone who believes in sitting on the fence? In
<br>
being 'open minded' about liberty? This is why I have been getting ever
<br>
more adamant about not treating kindly with the leaders of the luddite
<br>
groups that oppose an extropic future. The development of our culture
<br>
now and in the future is in a state of constant flux, and luddites are
<br>
treating it as a war, and they treat us as the enemy. Refusing to
<br>
acknowledge this and accept the state of conflict is, in fact, denial
<br>
born of fear, or cowardice, or just plain laziness or a concern for
<br>
other priorities.
<br>
<p>I accept that ExI, as the type of non-profit that it is, shouldn't be
<br>
active in political activities, but, dammit, that doesn't mean we
<br>
shouldn't have some sort of political action group organized to oppose
<br>
the forces of luddism. I challenge the members to enlist in the struggle
<br>
that has already begun.
