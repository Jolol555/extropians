Spudboy forwards:
<br>
<em>&gt; NEW YORK (Jan. 12) - The mystery invention code-named ''Ginger'' that has set 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the technology world abuzz may be little more than a motorized miniscooter, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judging from a recent patent application that came to light on Friday.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this was discussed here a couple of days ago in a post Max forwarded.
<br>
<p>However I believe a lightweight, motorized platform able to go up and
<br>
down curbs and stairs, with a clean, quiet non-polluting engine and
<br>
dynamic balancing capability does qualify for much of the hype which
<br>
has been surrounding it.
<br>
<p>After all, if it caught on, people would design cities for it, just as
<br>
cities are now designed around vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
<br>
<p>Riding on such a vehicle would be a remarkable experience, and the
<br>
dynamic balance would feel almost magical.  You lean in the direction
<br>
you want to go and the vehicle automatically takes you there.  It would
<br>
almost be like controlling it by pure thought.
<br>
<p>Technically I am interested to see whether Kamen has been able to
<br>
use his Stirling engine for this purpose.  On reading about these
<br>
engines at www.stirlingengine.com, they are highly efficient, clean and
<br>
quiet, but the problem is that they aren't as controllable as internal
<br>
combustion engines.  You can't step on the gas and rev them up - they
<br>
take a few minutes to heat up, and then the power output is constant,
<br>
and when you shut them off they continue to produce power for a while.
<br>
This isn't very appropriate for a vehicle.  Maybe for a scooter they
<br>
could use a hybrid Stirling/electric system but that would be bulky.
<br>
<p>BTW www.stirlingengine.com sells model engines that run from the heat of
<br>
a cup of hot water, and one that even runs from the heat of your hand!
<br>
They are expensive, though, $100-$300.
<br>
<p>Anyway, for me the scooter concept is still exciting and something I look
<br>
forward to seeing.  A lot of folks online thought it was going to be a
<br>
Star Trek transporter or a personal helicopter or anti-gravity device,
<br>
and of course that was just silly.  But people who have actually seen
<br>
the Ginger device are excited by it, and I am eager to learn more.
<br>
<p>Hal
