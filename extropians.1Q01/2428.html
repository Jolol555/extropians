<em>&gt; &gt; Humans have natural rights because of the type of natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being they are, because of their specific nature.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where 'natural' in 'natural rights' comes from.   'Rights'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in this context are those conditions in the interactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; among human beings required by human beings, by their nature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for optimal functioning.  Most such rights are negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such as the non-initiation of physical force rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; positive such as the supposed right some claim to goods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; provided by the work of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Counting from the beginning of the quoted paragraph, the third sentence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes sense to me. [Others don't.] &quot;Rights are those conditions in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions among human beings required by human beings for optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functioning.&quot; That is OK, that is the essence of my definition of 'rights'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What doesn't make sense to me is your attempt to state that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'conditions' are predetermined, and eternal. I have no capacity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand how anyone could believe such utter nonsense. I hope you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually believe that? Do you seriously believe that such 'conditions', as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you stated, are predetermined and eternal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you do, you sound utterly totalitarian to me, no matter how you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you're not. Because if it is so, you're making an outrageous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption that every human being's &quot;requirements for optimal functioning&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the same - and indeed, that such requirements never change.
</em><br>
<p>No, she isn't. What she is saying is that man naturally evolved to
<br>
behave as he is, and because of this evolved behavior (and the genes
<br>
they derive from), there is an 'optimum' set of rules for living that
<br>
produce the maximum happiness for the maximum possible number of people.
<br>
This is NOT totalitarian, this is an open ended, liberatarian, systems
<br>
based approach. However, to a european, I am sure being told to keep
<br>
their hands off controlling other people seems like fascism, just like
<br>
'freedom of religion' means the freedom to persecute other religions to
<br>
some fundamentalists.
