<p><p>OK.  But I still think you need to enroll people spiritually to get very
<br>
far. Spirituality is too much a part of too many people's life.  It is
<br>
arguably strongly programmed into humanity as a whole.  Also, technology
<br>
and science alone is not sufficient.  There is a question of what we
<br>
want to create, what type of world we want to inhabit, what types of
<br>
ethics we will bind our behavior by.  These sorts of questions are not
<br>
addressed by science.  They can be addressed philosophically outside of
<br>
spirituality in theory although in practice relatively little has been
<br>
done there.  Most philosophers also wash their hands of vision and
<br>
values type questions.
