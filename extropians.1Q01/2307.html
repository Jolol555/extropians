<em>&gt; One of the nasty little conspiracies alluded to in this article:

<p>Of course I can record anything in clear which a human has to eventually 
<br>
be able to see with his unmodified visual system: I just have to grab it 
<br>
directly from frame buffer, or film it off-screen (if the more rabid content 
<br>
controllers insist on putting cryptography into the last stage before 
<br>
the photon stream to the retina. You've surely seen the people who filmed 
<br>
off the last StarWars movie off-screen the first time it ran, and 
<br>
published .iso images of it on the web? The quality was even quite 
<br>
tolerable, and it was before modern compression algorithms like DivX.
<br>
<p>I personally don't watch TV, whether analog or digital, but I could imagine
<br>
that people would want to grab certain things and publish them just because
<br>
they can. For instance, a certain group of transhumanists might record relevant
<br>
news items, and push them into the forthcoming anonymous global publishing
<br>
infrastructure (freenet, mojonation).
<br>
<p>I dunno about all these super-special HDTVblahblah digital TV norms, the 
<br>
future is clearly flexible-format, rendered in software using hardware-accelerated 
<br>
(de)compression (of course, this also has the achilles foot of shifting standars,
<br>
in an attempt to lock userbase). On the long run I hope wall-sized video projectors 
<br>
and personal head-ups will push current displays (whether CRT or LCD) into speciality 
<br>
niches.
<br>
<p>Realtime broadcasts will need high QoS, though this can be alleviated by using
<br>
deep buffers, but this is utterly immaterial for overnight and background downloads.
<br>
I think video rental shops might be facing rather harsh times rather soon, at least
<br>
in regions with xDSL coverage. They just can't compete with a much larger number of
<br>
available videos, and the better quality and absence of physical and personal overhead.
