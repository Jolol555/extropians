<p><p>I never put bumper stickers on any of my vehicles, primarily for the reason 
<br>
that it makes it much more difficult to profile me or agitate anyone's 
<br>
prejudices while driving.  Along the same lines of reasoning, I have my 
<br>
vehicles tagged to the locales where they fit in, making it easier to blend 
<br>
in with the locals (big American truck - Nevada, European sports sedan - 
<br>
California).
<br>
<p>The &quot;guidelines&quot; for profiling people don't usually fly in locales where a 
<br>
significant fraction of the population meets the profile.  They are for 
<br>
areas where most people don't meet the profile.  Mostly I just try to be 
<br>
un-memorable, which means nothing too pretty or too ugly for the locale I 
<br>
am in (as judged by local standards).  I've personally never been harrassed 
<br>
by cops while driving and have only been pulled over for blatant violations 
<br>
of the law, but then, I don't really look interesting.  I *have* seen a lot 
<br>
of profiling by the cops, but it is of the sort where they only pull over 
<br>
cheap cars in expensive neighborhoods (California), or only pull over 
<br>
sedans with California plates (Nevada).  The prejudices are there, but they 
<br>
aren't arbitrary; they attempt to meet the local definition of riff-raff, 
<br>
whatever that may be.
