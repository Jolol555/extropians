<p><em>&gt; &gt;How about this:  One can take a test for one's self, submit one's car to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;periodic inspection and testing and pay more for a &quot;High Performance

Driver'
<br>
<em>&gt; s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;License&quot;.  Certified training at something like the Skip Barber driving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;schools might be a pre-requisite.  In it's full-blown &quot;smart' form, such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;system would allow one to activate the &quot;high-performance&quot; feature of one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;car/license on open roads, which would then initiate a special session of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;two-way communication to the road system.  The road network would sense 
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;traffic and weather conditions and then allow you to drive up to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;fraction of the limits of your combined car and driver rating under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;existing conditions.  The car reports real-time data on its operations to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;road system, such as tire pressure and temperature, lateral acceleration,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;excessive yaw, vibration and aerodynamic downforce.  Exceeding the car's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&quot;rating&quot; on any of these parameters would change the limit at which the 
</em><br>
car
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;would be able to operate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So you could tear down a road with blind curves, and not have to worry 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  about obstructions just out of sight, perhaps..
</em><br>
<p>Right . . . pretty cool, huh?  To my mind the basic issues impacting 
<br>
implementation of such a system are:
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  Can a system that accomplishes this be developed and implemented while at 
<br>
the same time preserving many of the GOOD things people like about automobile 
<br>
travel, i.e. autonomy and anonymity?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  How can a set of data standards and system protocols be developed?
<br>
<p>&lt;&gt;  What level of participation is necessary before such a system could be at 
<br>
least partially implemented?  This latter point is especially important, 
<br>
since the longevity of automobiles has been steadily creeping upward over the 
<br>
last ten years especially.  Many moderately-priced 2001 model cars are so 
<br>
well built and reliable that we could expect them to still be on the road 
<br>
well into the 2010s and even 2020s.  Given this issue, I would expect that 
<br>
many of the benefits of such a system will only be achievable if they can be 
<br>
implemented as a retrofit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;Under the such a system, there are lots of places
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;here in Texas where I could run my 'vette up to the drag limit (~160-180 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mph
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;- a nice safe margin, since Car and Driver magazine determined that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;windows on my car tend to blow out from Bornoulli Effect above c. 200 mph;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;something you can fix with duct tape, but which doesn't look so hot).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Are you serious? What holds the windows in there in the first place?
</em><br>
<p>Yes and not much, really (which is true of many cars these days that don't 
<br>
have completely-enclosed side window frames.)  In fact, only two little 
<br>
plastic clips hold in the windows on my car (and most similar designs).  Once 
<br>
I realized this, I started noticing it on lots of cars.  By the nature of 
<br>
fluid flows, aerodynamics gets to be increasingly important as speed 
<br>
increases.  Thus, for instance, GP cars being able to pull way more than 1 
<br>
lateral G at even moderate speeds.
