Well, last time I counted (or rather read), John D. Rockefeller Sr. 
<br>
had 92 descendants. How's that? If you can afford to support 'em, 
<br>
what's the problem? This is the the key--used to be, in order to 
<br>
support a large family and ensure your genes would go forth and 
<br>
multiply, you had to be exceptionally intelligent or exceptionally 
<br>
hardworking--else they'd all starve to death. In our present 
<br>
enlightened society, the least intelligent and those least inclined 
<br>
toward productive activities are financially supported by those more 
<br>
intelligent/productive--and it is they who produce herds of 
<br>
descendants. American society is subsidizing its own destruction.
<br>
<p>As to grandma--good for her. She makes my point above. We need more.

<em>&gt; &gt; You know how many captains of industry were grade school dropouts?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure. Plenty, but how many kids did they have???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, most of them were raised in a day and age when you didn't need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a law degree to be a practicing lawyer, an engineering degree to design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and build bridges, mills, and ships, and the concept of the MBA was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere gleam in the eyes of university provosts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most such individuals were home schooled, in fact, and frankly I'd pit a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kid with a 6th grade education from 1920 against a current day high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school graduate (or college graduate, even, depending on the college and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My grandmother was one such person, she dropped out of school after 6th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grade to raise her 8 brothers and sisters when her mother died (her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; father was an unemployed alcoholic). She worked as a seamstress and maid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in some rich person's mansion, then as a beautician, then she met my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grandfather who became a publishing executive. She never went back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school, but was the New England Scrabble champion, president of the New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hampshire Floral Association, and best of all, taught me to read at age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; four. She was one tough cookie, a terror to my mother. If she had chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go into business I am sure she would have been the epitome of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'brass balled bitch' type of female executive and would have fit just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine into any Rand or Heinlein novel. She was a very self confident and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self aware person who read voraciously her entire life (and not romance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novel crap either). She had three kids, which was pretty below average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for 1940.
