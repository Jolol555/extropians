Wow. Uhmm--you can't copyright an idea--only the &quot;expression&quot; of an 
<br>
idea. So basically anyone you send the &quot;idea&quot; to can say, &quot;Gee, funny 
<br>
thing--I had the same idea in the shower just this morning. Take a 
<br>
hike.&quot; No credit, no money, no nothing. 
<br>
<p>Write it out in screenplay format and copyright it using form PA (NOT 
<br>
form TX). Forms available online at: 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/forms/">http://www.loc.gov/copyright/forms/</a>
<br>
<p>That's $30 right there. Send it certified return receipt requested so 
<br>
you'll know when they get it. After you get the card back, THEN you 
<br>
might start contacting people. (Couldn't hurt to place a few copies 
<br>
with persons of good reputation as well, signed and dated by them for 
<br>
future reference.) If you don't send it certified, you'll have to 
<br>
wait until you get the papers back from the Copyright Office before 
<br>
you know if they ever received it. You're talking an 8-mo wait. 
<br>
Effective date of rtegistration, however, is the day they open it.
<br>
<p>Could be more effective to shoot it yourself, if that's possible--and 
<br>
then show it for greater effect. Copyright it first, of course.
<br>
<p>Basically, however, unless you know someone in the biz--you'd need a 
<br>
CRAY to calculate the odds of success.
<br>
But, hey--don't let that stop you.
<br>
I never do.
<br>

&gt; I have a cool idea for a TV ad that I think will sell a lotta
&gt; clothing.  Its edgy, funny and simple.  Now I want to sell
&gt; this idea to someone in the biz.  I dont even care how much
&gt; I get for it, as that isnt my usual line of business, but I
&gt; would like to at least get a token amount just to prove
&gt; it was my idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Somebody help me out here:  how do I do it?  Is there a
&gt; way to copyright a simple idea?  Its a funny little skit sorta
&gt; that can be made into a commercial.  Do I write it down
&gt; and send it to, say the Gap?  Or find out what company
&gt; makes ads for the Gap and send it to them, and ask
&gt; for a few hundred bucks if they use it?  Do I need to
&gt; make a hard copy, notarize it with a date and send it
&gt; to some reliable third party?  Can I send it to several ad
&gt; companies and tell them the first one to send me 500 clams
&gt; may use the idea?  Thanks in advance, spike
