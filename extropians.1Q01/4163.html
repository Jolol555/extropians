The remarkable thing is the growth rate in e-gold accounts--3,000 to 130,000
<br>
in six months.  They also charge much lower transaction fees than credit card
<br>
companies.  And via OmniPay, you can pay bills from your e-gold account.  It
<br>
will be interesting to see what happens when more and more transactions occur
<br>
via these currencies.

<p>&quot;...Converted into bits in this way, gold once again becomes a viable --
<br>
some would say vastly superior -- kind of money.  Conceptually, it
<br>
works like this: You transfer some dollars or euros or whatever to a
<br>
firm that buys gold for you and deposits it in a super-safe vault. You
<br>
then make payments from this account via credit card or PC, and the
<br>
gold -- without ever leaving the vault -- is credited to the
<br>
recipient's account. If the recipient prefers dollars, the gold is
<br>
electronically converted by exchanges, which now do the same with the
<br>
world's other currencies.
<br>
<p>The first attempt to turn this theory into reality is called e-gold,
<br>
and so far, so good. The number of e-gold accounts rose from 3,000 in
<br>
mid-1999 to 130,000 by the end of 2000.  The amount of e-gold in
<br>
circulation (which by definition is identical to the amount of gold
<br>
locked away in its vaults), has grown from 5,000 ounces in 1999 to
<br>
43,000 ounces. &quot;We finally hit our millionth transaction in November,&quot;
<br>
says e-gold founder Douglas Jackson, &quot;and we hit a million and a half
<br>
in December.&quot; All, notes Jackson, with a marketing budget of zero....&quot;
