<em>&gt; I have to say I don't really understand this paranoia of yours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In normal countries like where I live ;-), nobody has a gun. Only licensed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunters, police officers and army officers are allowed to have weapons. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else wants to have a weapon, it's a tough procedure to get it - among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things, you have to get a license and register with the government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you can be quite sure you won't get a license if you have any kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminal record. Without a license, no purchase possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So in your &quot;normal country&quot; you are totally at the mercy of your
<br>
government.  Are you sure this is a fine idea?  You are also at the
<br>
mercy of any young tough you can't outfight or outrun until your legal
<br>
protectors get there when you are accosted.  Is this such a good thing? 
<br>
Do you need a lesson from history of what has happened in many countries
<br>
where the citizens did not have guns or had their guns confiscated?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, the police can &quot;raid your house with a swat team, shoot first and ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions later&quot;. But it doesn't happen; we simply don't have a national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture of shooting each other. The police very rarely use their weapons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even in extreme cases, and each bullet is accounted for. And that's even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with our police being somewhat corrupt - there are reports that some of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take bribes to allow some people to do things they shouldn't, but I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard of a police officer to shoot a person that is anything less than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant, widely known and notorious criminal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but it does happen and it has happened in nations with all manner of
<br>
&quot;culture&quot;.  Are you really counting on rules of good sportsmanship to
<br>
always protect you?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, I don't think America's aversion against banning guns has any rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure at all. There is no need to buy them back. There is no need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy on guns. You just ban them, instate a heavy fine on owning illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons, and that's it. Give everyone a year or two to get used to the fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the problem is solved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>No, it isn't.  Whether you believe it or not people do have an innate
<br>
right to defend themselves if they so choose.  And some of us will fight
<br>
by all means, including force of arms, to never give up that right.  Do
<br>
you think that your belief in banning guns justifies and trumps our
<br>
belief that you are dead wrong?  On what basis?  Demonstrate to me your
<br>
perfect logic that strips me of my right to disagree and to have the
<br>
means to protect myself and those I consider it my duty to protect the
<br>
best I can.  And if in the end we still disagree then come around
<br>
yourself and try to take my guns away.  Don't send some poor underpaid
<br>
flatfoot to do it for you.  In the end your type of folks will not do
<br>
the dirty work themselves but rely on those who by force of arms on
<br>
threat of death come around and take away my nasty old arms.  Don't you
<br>
see what is wrong with that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In particular, your argument about someone protecting themselves with a gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the police &quot;raid his house with a swat team&quot; is, well, far off. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think your swat teams are expert enough that no one will survive shooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back against them. If they want to shoot you, they can do it anyway -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretending a gun provides any real protection against the police is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion. The only thing you might be able to do with it is kill a few good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police officers before they put a bullet in your head for doing so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so now your argument is that we can't really hope to ever win if the
<br>
government goons decide to come after us anyway so you may as well just
<br>
give up from the beginning heh?  How enlightening.  How uplifiting. 
<br>
NOT.  And what about the non-government goons who are amateurs looking
<br>
for easy (unharmed) marks?  Do you believe we should just give up to
<br>
them also?  You are right about one thing.  We can't take on the
<br>
federales in open conflict and win.  But that does not mean that we
<br>
should go defenseless or that being armed is no deterrent at all.  Even
<br>
the Nazis would have slowed down a little bit in dragging people from
<br>
their homes if enough of them had guns and fought back.  Do not
<br>
underestimate the deterrent value of armed people fighting for their
<br>
lives and their homes.
