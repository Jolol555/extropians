</em><br>
<p>Right!  Too bad its such a small area.  Be that as it may, we might be able
<br>
to enlarge it by putting together the biggest nuke we can and kerBLAMing
<br>
ourselves a big crater at each pole.  Of course we would want to first
<br>
mine and store elsewhere all the precious water that might be in the
<br>
ever-dark craters near the poles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obliquity (tilt of axis in degrees)..................0
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that the tilt of the axis is zero degrees. (I interpret this to mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the axis is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit.  Is that right?)
</em><br>
<p>Yup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would mean that the incident angle of sunlight is constant at any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given lattitude.  Logically, the temperature extremes shown above should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderated as one moves toward the poles.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  But to get anything like a humanable habitat, we need a crater
<br>
or canyon or trench near the pole so that direct sunlight never comes
<br>
in to spoil the fun.  One thing Ive often wondered about is how hot
<br>
is the soil near the poles?  If it is cool enough to move with equipment
<br>
similar to what we use on this rock, then we could make a base.
<br>
Otherwise we still have the nukes, and that even has a green angle
<br>
to it: see how we remove all these nukes from the green earth?  etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I found temperature and pressure profiles of the Venusian atmosphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Check out the graphs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right around 50 km altitude, temperature and pressure are around 300K and 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atm, perfect for human life. ...a dirigible or geodesic sphere works fine, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire interior space habitable.
</em><br>
<p>But we need to figure out how to stay in the shady side, since the solar flux
<br>
at Venus would be about thrice what it is here.  Owwww.  {8-[  Since Venus
<br>
rotates, our balloon would need to really haul to stay on the night side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone know the absorbtion characteristics of H2SO4?)
</em><br>
<p>The web knows.  It knows everything.  The web is god.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Winds at the top of the atmosphere are pretty fierce, 350 km/hr, but below the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clouds they're mild.
</em><br>
<p>We might be able to take advantage of those winds to keep our
<br>
dirigible on the night side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any chemists want to comment on the potential for energy extraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using sulphuric acid and carbon dioxide?
</em><br>
<p>No reaction possible there.  Carbon dioxide is stable as all get out.
<br>
For practical purposes it is already in a ground state as is molecular
<br>
nitrogen.  Now if we could get some flourine...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  In any event, it seems there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abundant supplies of C, H, O, and S.
</em><br>
<p>There is nitrogen too.  Thats important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or perhaps you could actually have a base on the surface.  With a floating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; component tethered to it, you could extract energy from the thermal gradient.
</em><br>
<p>Great stuff Jeff!  spike
