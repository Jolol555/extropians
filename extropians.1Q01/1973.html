</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical rockets.  No one tomorrow is gonna discover a
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am convinced we need to develop some means of keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the energy on the ground, transmitting it to the rising rocket
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by means of laser.  The infrastructure for doing this is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed in the form of weaponry: ground based lasers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airborne lasers.  In some form those weapons will be used to heat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propellant to lift rockets.  I just dont know how yet.  spike
</em><br>
<p>We talked about lasers before, and laser propulsion.  Some tinkerer had
<br>
launched a frisbee sized device using laser several hundred meters.  If our
<br>
launch backpack had a laser boost in the beginning as well, or laser for
<br>
combined interial reflection and propulsion mass reignition, keeping the laser
<br>
pointed at the missile (or rocket/missile hybrid) would require sophisticated
<br>
tracking, like an anti-missile rocket.
<br>
<p>I was thinking a lot of the reaction mass could be pulled from the air as it
<br>
goes through it.  By having the initial boost liquid or solid chemical engine,
<br>
it achieves speeds where air is moving into the intakes and being heated by the
<br>
partially air-colled fusion reaction, or water cooled with air cooled water
<br>
jacket.  Thus, the air is expelled at a high rate of speed.
<br>
<p>I notice the launch equations involve inverse square.  A fly flying from floor
<br>
to celing expends a lot less force than a human standing or jumping and
<br>
touching it.
