It appears as if Ross A. Finlayson &lt;<a href="mailto:raf@tiki-lounge.com?Subject=Re:%20No%20Federal%20parole&In-Reply-To=&lt;200102012306.AAA05311@color.sics.se&gt;">raf@tiki-lounge.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<p>I gather that most borganisms would wish to monopolize it for its own use,
<br>
The Thought Police - naturally, as it gives such power to control people.
<br>
<p>|&gt; I understand that humans in some jurisdictions temporarily lose their
<br>
|&gt; rights when convicted for a crime, so in those jurisdictions you would
<br>
|&gt; find it acceptable to perform that kind of re-programming, then?
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
|that television show.  Some police use immediate intimidation regularly.  I do
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Yes, tasers works well on humans who do not ignore pain.
<br>
<p>|Citizens have rights with regards to anyone trying to &quot;reprogram&quot; them.
<br>
<p>You are lucky to live in such a jurisdiction, or to have such faith.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>

<br>

<br>
|It would then.  For example, all most drugs do is increase or decrease various
<br>
|chemical levels in the bloodstream.  Many drugs are largely inert placeboes.
<br>
<p>You might not have realized that those chemical levels control your mental
<br>
processes - meaning your personality, your memories, everything that is you,
<br>
mind and body.
<br>
<p>Apart from that you're right.
