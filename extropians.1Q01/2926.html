I plan to live a good long time so I thoroughly expect to see many of
<br>
these things.  I don't think our problem for the next decade or two
<br>
(which I will certainly live through) is going to be breakthroughs.  The
<br>
problem will be dealing with the breakthroughs quickly and wisely enough
<br>
to stay afloat and steer somewhat in a direction we want to go.  I agree
<br>
that working for the breakthroughs comes before projects that can't
<br>
really work without some of those breakthroughs.  That's logical.  
<br>
<p>If we knew this planet was slated to be sterilized by some impact in 10
<br>
years you would see a mobilization of cash and resources such as  this
<br>
world has never seen.  I am not so cynical as to believe that we would
<br>
not care in such extreme circumstances.
