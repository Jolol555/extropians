<p><em>&gt;I would actually recommend &quot;Back to Basics&quot; (Either ROdale or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Reader's Digest Press, can't remember which right now) - an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incredibly good book on modern and traditional methods of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;construction, food prepartion and storage, crafts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc.  Everythign from how to lay a stone wall without mortar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ahmish barnraising to lumbering with a chainsaw, from underground
</em><br>
<em>&gt;houses with heat pumps to adobe dwellings, from salting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;canning, from dye-making to cloth-making and papermaking.  A good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;foundation for book #2, as well.
</em><br>
<p>It's Readers Digest, a good book.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The best book I've seen for &quot;survival&quot; situations was one I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encountered back in the late 80s, titled &quot;The SAS Manual - Survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anywhere Safely&quot; that was supposedly culled from the British RAF
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survival manuals.  It included sections on how to survive a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life-threatening situation (avalanche, plane or auto
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crash, etc.), first aid with an eye towards self-administration (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remember some useful tips about how to splint your own broken arm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- not something you'd see in many first aid manuals), construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of emergency shelter, techniques for starting a fire, and plants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and animals common and edible around the world.  Far more useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than a simple field guide to edible plants, this book 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would get you through the roughest two weeks at th ebeginning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting you set up to the point where you can use the information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the other two to start getting you ahead.
</em><br>
<p>John &quot;Lofty&quot; Wiseman's book, one of the three best survival books
<br>
I own. I keep this one in the  survival kit in my trunk.
<br>
<p>Another excellent choice is Larry Dean Olsen's &quot;Outdoor Survival
<br>
Skills&quot; and Tom Browns &quot;The Tracker&quot;.
<br>
<p>Check out the day the two met:
<br>
www.trackerschool.com/BrownOlsenInterview.htm
<br>
<p>also check out www.hollowtop.com
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One I HAVE to look up is by a Danish author who wrote a book on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how to make your own tools, basically a bootstrap manual to such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complex devices as highly accurate spanners and calipers, metal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and wood lathes, kilns and furnaces.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds very interesting, I don't know this book! If you find
<br>
it, please let us know!
