Ah, well. No, actually I meant for the reasonably forseeable future. 
<br>
And on the contrary, assuming ANYone's EVER going to fund it 
<br>
approaches absurdity.
<br>
<p>Also on the contrary (and as I said), I think there are a lot of 
<br>
exceptionally bright and well-meaning people here.
<br>
<p>There are, of course, bound to be exceptions...
<br>
<p>Odd that you equate science fiction with stupdity.
<br>
As the man said, Imagination is more important than knowledge.
