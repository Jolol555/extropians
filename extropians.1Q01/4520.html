Visual Surveillance and Monitoring Project
<br>

<br>
<p>The Forest of Sensors project is the MIT AI Lab's video surveillance 
<br>
and monitoring (VSAM) testbed. While there are many VSAM projects 
<br>
(see Related Links), our project is set apart by its three primary 
<br>
goals- persistence, full coverage, and automated configuration and 
<br>
processing.
<br>
<p>Persistence- Our system can run outdoors 24 hours a day 7, days a 
<br>
week collecting data the entire time with minimal interruptions. Our 
<br>
system has been running since September 1997 has processed on the 
<br>
order of one billion frames. full coverage- Many existing systems 
<br>
offer high-resolution, partial coverage of an area. Rather than using 
<br>
pan/tilt/zoom cameras to maximize the resolution on a particular 
<br>
object, our system uses many static cameras which offer full coverage 
<br>
all the time. With the advent of cheap hardware (cameras, signal 
<br>
processing, communications) we favor using many, small, cheap 
<br>
autonomous vision modules, rather than a few, expensive pan-tilt 
<br>
cameras only cover a portion of the scene at one time.
<br>
<p>Automated configuration and processing- The most interesting aspect 
<br>
of our work is that it is almost completely automated. Once the 
<br>
cameras are placed and tracking begins, all the work performed by the 
<br>
system is done with minimal human intervention. This includes 
<br>
maintaining a tracking database, relative calibration of the cameras, 
<br>
and object and activity classification.
