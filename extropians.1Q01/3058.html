<p>
<em>&gt;Because next thing you know it will be used to automatically track
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the comings and goings of targeted noncriminal individuals.
</em><br>
<p>Is that really a guaranteed slippery slope?  Wasn't the same thing 
<br>
said about wire tapping?  As with any law enforcement technology, 
<br>
this surveillance equipment will require heavy restrictions upon its 
<br>
use.  In the main, I'd think that it should only be used to search 
<br>
for known criminals or suspects under investigation, in which case 
<br>
the proper warrants should be required.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Stakeouts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are manpower intensive. Not anymore--set up one of these doohickeys,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or several, near the target area--and automatically record and ID
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone who comes and goes.
</em><br>
<p>I would think that storing those records would be illegal, and at 
<br>
very least such evidence should be inadmissible in a court of law.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Their faces will already be on record
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from drivers licenses. Set 'em up outside porno shops, see who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;visits. Outside areas where political rallies are held. At major
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intersections. Track everyone, everywhere, all the time--
</em><br>
<em>&gt;automatically. Then just punch in a name and see where he's been for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the past ten years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd call those tactics a real problem.
</em><br>
<p>C'mon, haven't we all come to realize that the whole Orwellian 
<br>
scenario never happened and it's unlikely to happen as long as 
<br>
citizens don't become total sheep?  And no, I'm not advocating acting 
<br>
like a sheep by allowing law enforcement agents to have better tools 
<br>
to do their jobs.
<br>
<p>With this law enforcement equipment, technologies like genetic 
<br>
engineering, and freedoms like legal drug use, it's easy to see 
<br>
slippery slopes everywhere that lead to disaster.  Does that mean 
<br>
that we should just give up on them?
<br>
<p>The key is to recognize and actively enforce the responsibilities 
<br>
upon the parties that stand to increase their liberties.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
