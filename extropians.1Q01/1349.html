Not at all; I have an extremely high opinion of many. I do, however, have
<br>
an extremely low opinion of the historic intransigence of scientists in
<br>
general regarding speculations--even absolute rock-solid hypotheses--which do not
<br>
conform to the 'accepted' dogma of the day. The established authorities get
<br>
their egos wrapped up in their own theories or the positions of prominence
<br>
they've gained through the refinement of others' and fight anything
<br>
contradictory tooth and nail--quite often with tactics having nothing to do with
<br>
science. Progress is made because they die of old age, are proven to be fools
<br>
(which they would not have been had they open-mindedly explored the new
<br>
hypotheses--but they are seldom proven fools in their lifetimes because no one
<br>
dare attack their position for fear of retribution), or are dragged kicking
<br>
and screaming into the future by less pig-headed individuals. Not
<br>
infrequently, the trailblazer who first saw the truth dies before it becomes
<br>
accepted--and so the field stands still for decades. The atmosphere this perpetuates is
<br>
one of fear, not discovery.
<br>
<p>Science is a wonderful process. Scientists, often, make it something less.
