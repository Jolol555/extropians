Just found this article;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,256-72761,00.html">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,256-72761,00.html</a>

<p>While much of it is about various issues other than Extropian/&gt;Human 
<br>
interests, he really hits the nail on the head about half way down.  eg;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But speaker after speaker on Monday cautioned that this branch of medical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research was going &quot;too far, too fast&quot;, straying from what Lord Habgood 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called &quot;its original moral justification&quot;. For whom does medicine go too fast?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;However wrong it may seem to some, genetic therapy will soon become a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter of lifstyle choice. One day identical twins will be created, and be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen as no different from natural ones (which are clones). People will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;store their eggs, their sperm, their brain cells. They will want new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organs, transplanted or cloned. And there will always be money in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Much medicine is distasteful, as much medicine is misguided. But I cannot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see any &quot;slippery slope&quot;, except towards the cure of disease and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improvement of the human condition.
</em><br>
<p>For what's a generally conservative newspaper, I'm pretty impressed with 
<br>
this Simon Jenkins.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p><p><p>James....
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
