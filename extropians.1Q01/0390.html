70% oppose cloning
<br>
Canadians skeptical about biotech: study
<br>
Chris Cobb
<br>
The Ottawa Citizen
<br>
<p>Canadians are overwhelmingly against cloning animals, and are also deeply
<br>
suspicious of genetically modified food and the use of pesticides made from
<br>
genetically modified bacteria.
<br>
<p>According to a newly released study, Canadians appear to have only sketchy
<br>
knowledge of biotechnology, which involves the manipulation of plant, animal
<br>
and human life forms.
<br>
<p>The study was conducted for Health Canada to test public knowledge and
<br>
opinion on various aspects of biotechnology, which is set to expand across
<br>
the planet with a speed some say will rival the growth of information
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>The study will be used to develop federal policy on such things as
<br>
bioengineered human prescription drugs, including insulin and antibiotics;
<br>
on genetically modified food, including corn and tomatoes; on animal growth
<br>
hormones to increase meat and milk production and on animal cloning.
<br>
<p>Although Canadians view some aspects of biotechnology with suspicion, the
<br>
study confirms other federal reports that most people are willing to take
<br>
minor risks if biotechnology can be proved beneficial to humanity --
<br>
especially the treatment of disease.
<br>
<p>But the majority also send this clear message to government: It's your
<br>
responsibility to protect us and before you make any decisions, show us the
<br>
scientific proof.
<br>
<p>&quot;When it comes to making decisions about the management and control of
<br>
biotechnology products,&quot; says the study, &quot;a majority of Canadians see
<br>
scientific evidence as more crucial than people's concerns and perceptions.&quot;
<br>
<p>The study, by the research firm Environics, was based on interviews with
<br>
1,508 Canadians conducted by telephone last summer. Surveys of that size are
<br>
considered accurate, plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of
<br>
20.
<br>
<p>Most Canadians (63 per cent) feel that government should create the
<br>
regulations governing biotechnology and have a structure in place to enforce
<br>
the regulations and to safeguard the public. A similar number want
<br>
development and management of biotechnology products to be co-ordinated
<br>
among several federal departments, and a whopping 90 per cent want
<br>
government to consult Canadians.
<br>
<p>Respondents were also asked this question: &quot;Biotechnology is the application
<br>
of science in the use of living organisms or their products to develop new
<br>
products and processes. Would you say you are very familiar, somewhat
<br>
familiar, not very familiar, or not at all familiar with biotechnology?&quot;
<br>
<p>Better-educated Canadians say they are most familiar with biotechnology, but
<br>
if the federal government wants a better-informed public, it clearly has a
<br>
lot of work to do. Only five per cent of those interviewed said they were
<br>
&quot;very familiar&quot; with the issue, while 62 per cent said they were either &quot;not
<br>
very familiar&quot; or &quot;not at all familiar.&quot;
<br>
<p>The level of familiarity with the subject is slightly lower than it was two
<br>
years ago, but the study says this may have more to do with competing public
<br>
messages about the risks and benefits of biotechnology.
<br>
<p>Canadians who say they have some knowledge of the subject are, however,
<br>
likely to be critical of the job the federal government is currently doing
<br>
in regulating and developing biotechnology.
<br>
<p>Although there is widespread ignorance about biotechnology, Canadians from
<br>
all walks of life are adamant in their opposition to animal cloning. Seven
<br>
out of 10 respondents said there is little or no benefit in cloning animals
<br>
for human consumption, and eight per cent disagreed.
<br>
<p>Canadians are skeptical about pesticides manufactured from genetically
<br>
modified bacteria, with 18 per cent saying they would provide a great deal
<br>
of benefit. They have mixed views on the benefits of genetically modified
<br>
crops. Fifty per cent said they would have a significant or moderate
<br>
benefit, while the other 50 per cent said the opposite.
<br>
<p>Older Canadians (66 or older) hold the most passionate views about
<br>
biotechnology and appear motivated by self-interest. The majority in this
<br>
group are in favour of bioengineered prescription drugs and developing new
<br>
strains of laboratory animals to study human diseases, but they are
<br>
overwhelmingly opposed to cloning animals and genetically modifying crops.
<br>
<p>Albertans are the most receptive to all aspects of biotechnology, and are
<br>
especially in favour of genetically modified food crops. Quebecers are least
<br>
supportive of biotechnology in general. Ontarians are generally supportive
<br>
of all aspects of biotechnology, other than animal cloning, and people in
<br>
the Atlantic provinces feel about the same.
<br>
<p>In an earlier study conducted for Industry Canada, 75 per cent were shocked
<br>
to learn that three-quarters of ingredients in store-bought food were
<br>
genetically modified. Many were angry that this had been done without their
<br>
knowledge or consent, and 93 per cent of respondents demanded genetically
<br>
modified products be labelled.
