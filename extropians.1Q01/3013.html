<em>&gt; |If any citizen is given and is made to consume any substance against their

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The term &quot;poisoned&quot; often implies that the person has ingested a poison.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The definition you used above makes the concept &quot;poisoned&quot; a less meaningful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one. Or maybe you try to make a political statement on the badness of giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a subject a substance without their consent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By your definition above, if you administer any kind of medication to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconscious, you either poison that human, or that human lost its citizenship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with its consciousness, both rather uncommon standpoints.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think if it's administered under the Hippocratic oath or similar moral and
<br>
ethical standards, that's different.  Administering emergency medicine to save the
<br>
life of another when they would otherwise die against their will is only
<br>
admirable.
<br>
<p>If, without regard to their health or knowledge, the citzens have introduced to
<br>
them biologically active chemicals then that is a serious problem whether it be
<br>
from private, commercial, or government entity, or the water.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that humans in some jurisdictions temporarily lose their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights when convicted for a crime, so in those jurisdictions you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find it acceptable to perform that kind of re-programming, then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is an ambiguous term.  From watching the television show &quot;Cops&quot;, I have watched
<br>
that television show.  Some police use immediate intimidation regularly.  I do
<br>
some business with sheriff's departments.  If a violent drunk has started a fight
<br>
and continues, he should be subdued non-chemically and placed in a holding van or
<br>
cell.  The police can carry tasers to incapacitate anyone, almost regardless of
<br>
whether they are on PCP.
<br>
<p>Citizens have rights with regards to anyone trying to &quot;reprogram&quot; them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feel free to elaborate on your standpoint, in case you (dis)agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |There are many various behavior-modifying drugs and foods.  For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; + chocolate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |is known to induce endorphin release.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chocolate contains a large mix of various substances, some of which do induce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endorphin release in some subjects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |You mention that the drugs you mention have various effects, as well, various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; + doses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |have differering effects.  I'm not a pharmacologist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The effect of almost any substance depends a lot on the dosage administered.
</em><br>
<p>It would then.  For example, all most drugs do is increase or decrease various
<br>
chemical levels in the bloodstream.  Many drugs are largely inert placeboes.
