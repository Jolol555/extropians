<p><em>&gt; But the goal of the magus is to &quot;equilibrate their personality&quot; in order
</em><br>
to &quot;direct the forces of nature.&quot; Magick is perhaps as close to science 
<br>
to &gt; religion &gt; and *does* have a contribution to make .. 
<br>
<em>&gt;the scientist ignores the &gt; development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their own personality, whereas the religious person only bothers with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, and leaves direction of the forces of nature to God. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Magick combines both.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds like gobbledegook. How? To what end?
<br>
<p>Emlyn
<br>
<p>I am saying is that the psychological dimension (ethical
<br>
discussion if you like) is missing from the scientific training.
<br>
The religious person does not want to &quot;meddle&quot; with nature by 
<br>
their instinct, because they think everything is pre-ordained
<br>
in some divine plan, and that higher intelligences than ours are
<br>
extant. Science can tend to be overoptimistic and gung-ho.
<br>
<p>Forget the historical associations ... modern 'magic' is not
<br>
necessarily supernaturalist or even ceremonial. The NLP 
<br>
approach is about *magical* trance-formation. But personal
<br>
growth/ psychological development should be integral to 
<br>
scientific training ... and religious (supernaturalist) claims
<br>
should be rigorously challenged at every opportunity, and not 
<br>
given credibility or taught in schools as fact.
<br>
<p>Not everyone is driven enough to want to influence the
<br>
course of nature or social events &amp;c., but I have found 
<br>
magickal training and discipline one useful factor in my
<br>
personal progress to being post-human.'  We should have
<br>
at least some knowledge of the arcane and hidden tradition
<br>
of knowledge for the sake of fuller information. My aims as
<br>
a bodhisattva, magus and post-human fortunately coincide.
