<em>&gt;From: Barbara Lamar &lt;<a href="mailto:altamiratexas@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Advertising%20as%20art%20-%20Was:%20Re:%20Extro%20IT%20Techies%20list?&In-Reply-To=&lt;F34ok84FTA7OIkUqLpH00002538@hotmail.com&gt;">altamiratexas@earthlink.net</a>&gt;

<br>
<em>&gt;My doctoral dissertation (not completed...yet)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was on the psychological aspects of decision making, and it was in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;marketing journals that I consistently found the most sophisticated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research on what makes people decide and act as they do. A good marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strategist seeks to know human nature and work with it, rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fighting it and trying to re-shape it.
</em><br>
<p>This is not surprising given that the rewards for successfully
<br>
understanding and working with that nature are dramatic and
<br>
_not_ automatic: if your surmise doesn't work, you see it in
<br>
your pocketbook.  People simply don't buy what you're trying
<br>
to sell.
<br>
<p>Contrast this to the practice of clinical psychology, where
<br>
two different therapists can adhere to equally bogus - but
<br>
diametrically opposed - models of the workings of the human brain,
<br>
even with respect to fundamental aspects of motivational
<br>
psychology (e.g. what would get you to plunk down money for
<br>
a widget), but have equally financially successful clinical
<br>
practices, regardless of the success in &quot;treating&quot; clients.
<br>
Churn those clients, baby.
<br>
<p>Contrast that to the long term career of a successful advertising
<br>
strategist, the validity of whose guesses has a _much_ stronger
<br>
correlation to her financial standing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A personal note on the subject of advertising as art--one of my favorite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;works of art of all time is a television ad that ran many years ago. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe it was advertising perfume--possibly Chanel. The ad is stored in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memory in black and white--whether the actual ad was b&amp;w or color I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be sure. It showed a woman diving into a rectangular pool and gliding under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;water. As she glided, the shadow of an airplane passed over her body. Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone else remember this ad?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Who could forget it?  I didn't.
<br>
<p>I was more struck, though, by the chance sighting (I didn't
<br>
often have my TV on then) of the Orwell-themed advert done
<br>
in (when else?) 1984.  Made quite an impression on me: I'd
<br>
just gotten out of high school and was deep into my early
<br>
Objectivist phase.
<br>
<p>See <a href="http://www.clioawards.com/">http://www.clioawards.com/</a> if you're interested in
<br>
the subject of &quot;advertising as art&quot;.
