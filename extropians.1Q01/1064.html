<p>Excessive leeryness is lost with experience, but it is always smart to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; know enough about them to make an informed decision.
</em><br>
<p>First off, what country and state/province and city are you in? This
<br>
makes a big difference as to how to approach things, but I would look
<br>
into signing up for firearms safey classes as soon as you can. The NRA
<br>
supports a worldwide network of instructors and classes that anyone can
<br>
use to gain proficiency, and most all jurisdictions that require
<br>
training prior to obtaining permits recognise these classes as qualified
<br>
(indeed, they were first created specificially for New York State
<br>
training requirements). So far as I know, only Massachusetts does not
<br>
recognise NRA training classes (though they've swiped the material and
<br>
run their own classes for many times more money). Go to www.nraila.org
<br>
and follow the links for info on classes near you.
<br>
<p>Then you want to decide what gun you are going to use.
<br>
This is determined by several factors: What will be your purpose in self
<br>
defense? what your normal style of dress will be while carrying (though
<br>
I own a couple for summer vs winter wear), your body size and strength,
<br>
as well as what you are comfortable with.
<br>
<p>If you are only interested in home defense then you could easily use a
<br>
pump action shotgun with frangible slugs or buckshot, or a heavy caliber
<br>
pistol with frangible bullets. If you are in a high crime area with
<br>
corrupt cops, you might be worried about criminals with body armor
<br>
(surplus vests sold to them by cops, no kidding, Seattle is one of these
<br>
towns), in which case you would want something that penetrates this,
<br>
like a .22, .22-250, .22 hornet, or .22 magnum round (these are good
<br>
rounds for a backup weapon if you plan on carrying one). 
<br>
Using frangible ammo is smart because it limits penetration, so you
<br>
don't have to worry so much about the bullet going through a perp and
<br>
hitting a bystander behind them as well, or penetrating a wall and
<br>
hitting someone on the other side. 
<br>
If stopping power is what you are interested, dropping a perp
<br>
immediately with little chance of him continuing an assault, then you'll
<br>
want to use a larger caliber pistol round, from 9mm, .40, .45 ACP, .45
<br>
Special, .45 Long Colt, .44 magnum, .454 Casull, or .480 Ruger. Hollow
<br>
point ammo, especially +P powered hollow point like Cor-Bon is highly
<br>
effective in stopping a perp, but oddly enough less likely to kill them
<br>
from wounds than a small caliber like .22 (because they don't go into
<br>
shock as easily from smaller calibers, they bleed easier). At this
<br>
point, 9mm and .40 Liberty are the primary self defense calibers, with
<br>
.45 ACP and .44 magnum close behind. .454 Casull is a powerhouse round
<br>
that only a well built man over 6 feet can really handle with ease.
<br>
Now, if concealability is your thing, then you could look at a .25, .32,
<br>
or .357 caliber gun. SeeCamp, and some clone companies make some decent
<br>
very compact .32 caliber autoloaders that fit in the pocket of one's
<br>
khakis with little or no 'printing' or sag. The Airlite .357 and .38
<br>
special revolvers from S&amp;W and Taurus are made from titanium and are
<br>
extremely light with similar concealability.
<br>
<p>Before you choose your gun, make some friends at a local club and tell
<br>
them you are shopping and would like to try what they have if they are
<br>
willing.  Don't buy your first gun new from the manufacturer, a used gun
<br>
is fine and most stock in many gunshops are used weapons that are
<br>
generally kept in excellent condition. Some gunshops have basement
<br>
ranges, typically if they run classes as well they will have a range
<br>
that you can try out different used guns. Read gun magazines and books,
<br>
become one of those guys at the grocery story people look leery at for
<br>
reading 'those gun magazines' (sometimes I'll read 'Soldier of Fortune'
<br>
at Borders Books while emitting a Beavis-like chuckle, just to see what
<br>
people around me do...;-)). A book on home gunsmithing for minor things
<br>
is an excellent reference.
