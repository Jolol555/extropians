<p>If no means of circumventing C is discovered prior to the singularity,

the speed of light will put an ultimate damper on the rate at which
<br>
information transfer can take place within the zone that is transcending.
<br>
You can cram more bits down a channel by increasing the clock speed, but
<br>
you can't circumvent its latency.
<br>
<p>If a good chunk of the transcending entities are scattered across a radius
<br>
of light-minutes or light-hours rather than light-milliseconds (as is the
<br>
case for our current planet-bound civilization) then the pace of singularity
<br>
change will be retarded by several orders of magnitude.
<br>
<p>Note that this assumes that there's a hard transition from one mode
<br>
of growth to another. If there isn't, if we don't come up with a
<br>
fundamentally more powerful way of thinking (rather than simply thinking
<br>
faster), we may simply end up with a very rapid period of progress --
<br>
the steepest part of a sigmoid curve -- followed by a plateau. Life on
<br>
the plateau should be fun, but not as qualitatively different from what
<br>
we understand today as some people expect.
