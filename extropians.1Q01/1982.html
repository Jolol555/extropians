Do you have any links to tweaking the

individual axioms of axiomatic QM?
<br>
I'm especially interested in tweaking
<br>
the axioms involving the integral of
<br>
the intensity of Psi.... you know
<br>
the Born stuff and such...

Quantum Theory From Five Reasonable Axioms
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0101012">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0101012</a>
<br>
The usual formulation of quantum theory is based
<br>
on rather obscure axioms (employing complex Hilbert
<br>
spaces, Hermitean operators, and the trace rule for
<br>
calculating probabilities). In this paper it is shown
<br>
that quantum theory can be derived from five very
<br>
reasonable axioms. The first four of these are
<br>
obviously consistent with both quantum theory and
<br>
classical probability theory. Axiom 5 (which requires
<br>
that there exists continuous and reversible
<br>
transformations between pure states) rules out
<br>
classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 is
<br>
substituted by another axiom, Axiom 5C, then we
<br>
obtain classical probability theory instead.
<br>
This work provides insight into the reasons quantum
<br>
theory is the way it is. For example, it explains
<br>
the need for complex numbers and where the trace
<br>
formula comes from. We also gain insight into
<br>
the relationship between quantum theory and
<br>
classical probability theory.

Consistency, Amplitudes and Probabilities
<br>
in Quantum Theory
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9804012">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9804012</a>
<br>
Quantum theory is formulated as the only consistent
<br>
way to manipulate probability amplitudes. The crucial
<br>
ingredient is a consistency constraint: if there are
<br>
two different ways to compute an amplitude the two
<br>
answers must agree. This constraint is expressed
<br>
in the form of functional equations the solution
<br>
of which leads to the usual sum and product rules
<br>
for amplitudes. A consequence is that the Schrodinger
<br>
equation must be linear: non-linear variants of quantum
<br>
mechanics are inconsistent. The physical interpretation
<br>
of the theory is given in terms of a single natural rule.
<br>
This rule, which does not itself involve probabilities,
<br>
is used to obtain a proof of Born's statistical postulate.
<br>
Thus, consistency leads to indeterminism.
