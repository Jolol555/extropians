<br>
Hormone replacement therapy fails to slow atherosclerosis progression
<br>
<p>A study published in February's Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular
<br>
Biology:  Journal of the American Heart Association, examined the effects
<br>
of hormone replacement therapy on women with increased risk of coronary
<br>
artery disease.  The trial  involved 321 healthy, postmenopausal women
<br>
with increased intima-media thickness in greater than one segment of the
<br>
carotid artery, an indicator of atherosclerosis.  For a forty-eight week
<br>
period, the participants received one of three regimens:   1 mg estradiol
<br>
plus 25 micrograms progestin (synthetic progesterone) for twelve days each
<br>
month, 1 mg estradiol plus 25 micrograms progestin for twelve days every
<br>
three months, or no hormone replacement.  The maximum intima-media
<br>
thickness of six carotid artery segments was measured by ultrasound before
<br>
and after the study.  At the study's conclusion, the groups receiving
<br>
hormone replacement therapy experienced an increase in mean maximum
<br>
intima-media thickness of .03 millimeters, while the group on no hormone
<br>
replacement therapy experienced an increase of .02 mm.  So not only did
<br>
hormone replacement therapy fail to slow the progression of
<br>
atherosclerosis in these women that occurred in nearly a year's time, the
<br>
group receiving hormone replacement experienced slightly greater
<br>
progression than the group receiving no synthetic hormones.
<br>
<p>In the same issue, researchers at Osaka University in Japan reported that
<br>
progesterone, not progestins, may inhibit atherosclerosis.  Progesterone
<br>
is the natural form of progesterone, identical to what is produced in the
<br>
human body.  Progestins are have a slightly different molecular structure
<br>
than natural progesterone, and are commonly administered in combination
<br>
with estradiol in hormone replacement therapy to help prevent the risk of
<br>
endometrial cancer associated with estradiol-only hormone replacement.  In
<br>
this study, the effects of progesterone and the progestin
<br>
medroxyprogesterone acetate on tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced
<br>
expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were measured in
<br>
endothelial cells derived from human umbilical veins.  The expression of
<br>
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 is one of the earliest known events that
<br>
occurs in atherosclerosis.  Progesterone inhibited the expression of
<br>
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, while synthetic progesterone did not.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOLS
<br>
Female Hormone Modulation Therapy
<br>
<p>Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) remains controversial. FDA-approved
<br>
estrogen drugs have been documented to cause cancer. The most conclusive
<br>
report showed that women taking estrogen and a synthetic progestin drug
<br>
had a 32 to 46% increase in their risk of breast cancer (New England
<br>
Journal of Medicine, June 15, 1995). These estrogen and progestin drugs
<br>
carry warning labels listing a shocking array of dangerous side effects.
<br>
<p>Unlike estrogen drugs, phytoestrogens have a balancing effect on the body.
<br>
When estrogen levels are too low, their very mild estrogenic effect raises
<br>
total estrogenic activity. When estrogen levels are too high, they compete
<br>
with estrogen at cell membrane receptor sites, thus lowering total
<br>
estrogenic activity.
<br>
<p>Some women experience such severe menopausal symptoms that natural, safe
<br>
forms of estrogen supplements do not provide sufficient relief. If this
<br>
occurs, and a woman is afraid of the cancer risks and side effects of
<br>
long-term therapy with estrogen drugs approved by the FDA, there is a
<br>
third option. Estriol is used extensively in Europe for estrogen
<br>
replacement therapy in menopausal and postmenopausal women, but to date
<br>
has rarely been used for that purpose in the United States. It can,
<br>
however, be obtained in the U.S. from compounding pharmacies with a
<br>
doctor's prescription. Evidence suggests that estriol offers many of the
<br>
benefits of more traditional estrogen-replacement therapies, but without
<br>
the harsh side effects or longer term dangers often encountered by other
<br>
substances and trademarked products.
<br>
<p>Throughout mature life, women will experience a gradual loss of another
<br>
critical hormone, progesterone. This decline becomes significant as women
<br>
get closer to menopause. Symptoms of a progesterone deficit include
<br>
premenstrual discomfort, night sweats, and hot flashes, along with a loss
<br>
of the sense of well-being (depressed feelings). During and after
<br>
menopause, natural progesterone synthesis often grinds to a halt, setting
<br>
the stage for a host of menopausal miseries and degenerative diseases.
<br>
<p>Progesterone has many beneficial properties, such as the activation of
<br>
natural killer cells, but one factor of special relevance is that
<br>
progesterone diminishes the production of a cancer-causing form of
<br>
estrogen called 4-hydroxy-estrone, while increasing the production of
<br>
cancer-preventing estriol. In other words, estrogen may be made safe
<br>
through the concomitant use of progesterone, particularly when taken in
<br>
natural forms.

<p><p>Male Hormone Modulation Therapy
<br>
<p>As men age past year 40, hormonal changes occur that perceptibly inhibit
<br>
physical, sexual, and cognitive function. The outward appearance of a
<br>
typical middle aged male shows increased abdominal fat and shrinkage of
<br>
muscle mass, a hallmark effect of hormone imbalance. A loss of feeling of
<br>
well being, sometimes manifesting as depression, is a common psychological
<br>
complication of hormone imbalance.  Until recently, these changes were
<br>
attributed to &quot;growing old,&quot; and men were expected to accept the fact that
<br>
their bodies were entering into a long degenerative process that would
<br>
someday result in death.
<br>
<p>A remarkable amount of data has been compiled indicating that many of the
<br>
diseases that middle aged men begin experiencing, including depression,
<br>
abdominal weight gain, and prostate and heart disease, are directly
<br>
related to hormone imbalances that are correctable with currently
<br>
available drug and nutrient therapies. To the patient's detriment,
<br>
conventional doctors are increasingly prescribing drugs to treat
<br>
depression, elevated cholesterol, angina, and a host of other diseases
<br>
that may be caused by an underlying hormone imbalance.
<br>
<p>If doctors checked their male patients' blood levels of estrogen,
<br>
testosterone, thyroid, and DHEA (instead of prescribing drugs to treat
<br>
symptoms), they might be surprised to learn that many problems could be
<br>
eliminated by adjusting hormone levels to fit the profile of a healthy
<br>
21-year-old.
<br>
Few physicians know what hormone blood tests to order for men, nor do they
<br>
have the experience to properly adjust hormones to reverse the
<br>
degenerative changes that begin in mid-life.
<br>
<p>This protocol will provide the patient and physician with the information
<br>
necessary to safely modulate hormone levels for the purpose of pre-venting
<br>
and treating many of the common diseases associated with growing older.

<p><p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>ProFem
<br>
Pro Fem contains USP natural progesterone from soy. Pro Fem is used by
<br>
women to prevent osteoporosis, premenstrual syndrome, some cancers and
<br>
some of the side effects of estrogen replacement therapy. For severe
<br>
osteoporosis, the following regimen is suggested:
<br>
<p>First jar: Use 1/2 teaspoon morning and night.
<br>
Second jar: use 1/4 teaspoon morning and night.

<p>Natural Estrogen
<br>
<p>Millions of women fail to replace the estrogen they lose when they grow
<br>
older because of their fear of cancer. The risks of breast and ovarian
<br>
cancer for postmenopausal women have been well documented.
<br>
<p>In an attempt to provide aging women with the multiple rejuvenation
<br>
effects of estrogen without side effects, scientists have developed plant
<br>
extracts with estrogenic activity (phytoestrogens) to substitute for
<br>
FDA-approved drugs. At the recent scientific meeting of the North American
<br>
Menopause Society, gynecologists were avidly searching for answers to
<br>
questions their patients have been asking them about natural hormone
<br>
replacement.  Natural Estrogen is one answer to concerns about the risks
<br>
of estrogen replacement. Natural Estrogen was developed by a biochemist
<br>
with 40 years of experience with phytohormones (hormones from plants)
<br>
working in conjunction with a practicing gynecologist. Natural Estrogen
<br>
contains potent, standardized, estrogenic extracts such as glycyrrhetic
<br>
acid (from licorice root), angelica, and wild organic Himalayan yams.
