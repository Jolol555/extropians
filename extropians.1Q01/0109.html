I'm sorry, you're mixing up two stories. The story I was telling had
<br>
nothing to do with bacteria, and everything to do with letting kids
<br>
figure out as much as they're able. She didn't have as much trouble with
<br>
the concept of &quot;metaphor&quot; as you seem to be having with the prospect of
<br>
her understanding it.
<br>
<p>Beyond that: I did not make, and will try to avoid making, any comments
<br>
about &quot;average&quot; five-year-olds. I made a happy comment about one five
<br>
year old I know, and another sad comment about a twelve-year-old I know.
<br>
I can't talk about &quot;average&quot; people with any degree of confidence. I
<br>
think labeling people with that broad a description is a bad idea. I got
<br>
labeled &quot;smart&quot;, and it gave me problems. I doubt you will learn much
<br>
about real five year olds from talking to me about &quot;average&quot;
<br>
five-year-olds. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps, by &quot;average&quot;, you meant &quot;most&quot;. One size does not fit all. Nor
<br>
does a single &quot;methodology&quot;, as typically described. If one can't &quot;go
<br>
meta&quot; with one's methodology, one can always blame the child or the
<br>
teacher. :)
<br>
<p>I am not opposed to doing anything that works. Anders Sandberg (are you
<br>
there, Anders?) wrote a GREAT fable about DNA therapy as a variation on
<br>
Sleeping Beauty. Time for a re-post, maybe?
<br>
<p>But beware--there are big words. Even so, I bet I could tell the story
<br>
to (some, not all) kids and they'd love it until, and beyond, the time
<br>
that they were old enough to understand.
<br>
<p>And, by the way, my name is &quot;Butler&quot; with one &quot;t&quot;. Thanks.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the meaning of the word metaphor  by using &quot;not really&quot; in the explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Using the word doesn't always equal understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I am not here to launch a polemic, my goal is to learn even if I

<em>&gt; Subject: Re: Subject: Re: Bacteria question.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I once saw a couple of &quot;professional educators&quot; simper condescendingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at me as they watched me explain the word &quot;metaphor&quot; to a five year old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They &quot;knew better&quot; than to tell a five year old a word like that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why was I explaining the word? Because she'd just criticized something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd said, saying &quot;Not _really_.&quot; And I agreed. &quot;No, not _really_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really. They call it a metaphor.&quot; &quot;What's _that_?&quot; So I told her. And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told her what the difference between a metaphor and a fib was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She used the word five times within the next week. On her own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, I recently used the word on the telephone with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twelve-year-old. Her response was &quot;Don't use such big words; remember,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm only in *public* school.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hardly think an honest response to a question about bacteria destroys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of wonder. And I weep for the upbringing of the twelve-year-old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is an ordinary five-year-old supposed to be told fairy tales when she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asks for an explanation about why she's supposed to brush her teeth? Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;tickling her imagination&quot;, in this instance, what is called for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you assuming too much, perhaps?
