<p><p>All you've described is an efficient market, not a living being.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Naturally, the 'group entity' only behaves as a living thing, but it is

</em><br>
<em>&gt;something that is alive&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>Your definition of &quot;living thing&quot; is awfully loose.  You could apply that 
<br>
definition to any number of mechanical devices that you would probably 
<br>
agree are not alive.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;We already have large numbers of such 'group entities', and they are of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most ordinary kind - businesses, armies, and even entire countries. We all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actively participate in them - the only person I could think of that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;participate in any 'group entity' would be someone living alone on an island
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somewhere, with little or no interactions to any other human being.
</em><br>
<p><p>So then you agree that &quot;group entities&quot; of humans are built entirely on 
<br>
voluntary participation and are by no means necessary for individual 
<br>
survival.  Voluntary participation in a &quot;group entity&quot; sounds a lot like a 
<br>
spontaneous organization of individuals in a free market.  Group entities 
<br>
as applied to humans are a convenient naming conventions.  Your &quot;society&quot; 
<br>
is an arbitrary application of grouping.  What is your metric for 
<br>
&quot;society&quot;?  If I can voluntary join or voluntarily leave a group, at what 
<br>
point am I designated &quot;a member of society&quot; regardless of my individual 
<br>
disposition?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So, whether you accept it or not, you _are_ a part of a 'living' organism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are but a tiny cell in it.
</em><br>
<p><p>Many types of cells cannot survive on their own.  Ones that can (or 
<br>
collections that can) are individual organisms.  Two creatures living in 
<br>
symbiosis are not the same creature.  A cell that can choose to 
<br>
disassociate itself from the organism and survive is an individual organism 
<br>
in its own right.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The organism takes care of you, and you make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your own tiny contributions to the organism.
</em><br>
<p><p>This isn't even an accurate description of people.  Individuals can survive 
<br>
quite handily on their own.  Interdependence between people is an 
<br>
artificial condition -- it exists because it is beneficial to all parties, 
<br>
not because it is required by nature.  There is a huge difference between a 
<br>
survival necessity and a survival convenience on a biological level.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that you are operating under some strange premises that 
<br>
appear to be obviously incorrect on their face.  Perhaps you should 
<br>
re-examine these, because you aren't making any sense to me.
