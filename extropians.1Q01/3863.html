<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, I've lately been wondering whether thoughts really need to

be

the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; human-readable.
</em><br>
<p>I'll wager it's the latter. Since when has human-readability bothered you?
<br>
:)
<br>
<p>(Actually that wasn't a poke at your writing style (although I could do with
<br>
a dedicated cortex for that), more your preference for a codic cortex over a
<br>
visual cortex, which I once argued was easier to debug (for humans)).

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, that wasn't the response you were looking for... what got me onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that track was thinking about our mental stream-of-consciousness, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the sentences come from in the first place, and what the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is between thinking up the sentence and actually enunciating it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internally.  Plus at least one person on SL4 saying that they had learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think without enunciating a stream of consciousness, which is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I once tried to do but hadn't even begun to make progress on.  So I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started to wonder whether the full complexity was really necessary.
</em><br>
<p>I'll add myself as another data point. I sometimes think (and code) without
<br>
an internal conversation too. Perhaps my language centers are completely out
<br>
to lunch - I admit I'm not a terribly good verbal communicator.
<br>
<p>Now, if I were to throw a ball to you unexpectedly, you'd probably catch it
<br>
without any internal dialog. Language isn't necessary for intelligent
<br>
behaviour. It certainly helps, but it's only one way of thinking. Visual
<br>
thinking is another.
<br>
<p>I remember seeing my little nephew solve a problem before he could talk. He
<br>
wanted to play with the water in the kitchen sink but couldn't reach, so he
<br>
remembered where he'd seen a footstool and brought it into the kitchen. At
<br>
no point did he use language to solve that problem, yet his behaviour was
<br>
intelligent.
<br>
<p>Chimps do relatively well without language too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also please give your working definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;thought&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In humans, the running dialogue that forms our stream of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Formed by taking symbols - nouns, adjectives; content creators and content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modifiers - mutually targeted in such ways as to form coherent structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that load coherent visualizations into working memory.
</em><br>
<p>Don't assume language primitives are the only objects to play with in
<br>
conscious thought.
<br>
<p>For instance, think about how you open various items of food packaging.
<br>
You're constantly solving lots of tiny puzzles from how to hold the object,
<br>
how too grip, where to pull or tear, and when to get some scissors or use
<br>
your teeth - all without langauge.
<br>
<p>These are conscious thoughts too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In AIs, the highest level of description of cognitive content - the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that implements the business of designing and analyzing and planning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so on, as seen on CaTAI section 2.4, &quot;Thoughts&quot;.  I initially thought this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was going to work the same way as in humans; now I'm no longer sure this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the simplest possible implementation, but I'm still planning to do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human way unless something concretely simpler comes along.
</em><br>
<p>I still think you're taking a too high-level approach. I believe there *is*
<br>
a much simpler implementation, although I wouldn't dare use such a word as
<br>
'concrete' until I have the code running.
<br>
<p>BTW I urge you to begin coding and resist calls to write a book. Working
<br>
code says far more. In my experience, sometimes it's just best to dive in,
<br>
rather than try to plan it all perfectly. Failure is fine, it's part of
<br>
progress. You'll end up knowing far more about why it didn't work for the
<br>
second attempt.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Dale Johnstone.
