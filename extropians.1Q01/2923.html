<em>&gt; Nonsense, sorry Samantha.  The colony would need to be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplies would pretty much be outta the question.  It is too

</em><br>
<em>&gt; tech, its hard to hit an exact target.  It all goes together in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one mission.  Please keep reading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Exactly how would you do that?  Almost everything it needs for quite
<br>
some time will be imported.  Especially in manufactured objects.  Or do
<br>
you think you re going to get enough people to run an economy to
<br>
manufacture everything you need (or enough robotics) immediately in the
<br>
first shot?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Like the dearth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; volunteers to go endure utterly horrid conditions and a huge likelihood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of death with no discernible golden lining for quite some time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed this is a problem, but this crowded planet has over 6E9
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons to choose from.  Also recall that the ideal candidate may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from that segment of society that is not accustomed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having the chance to do cool things.  You are I are used to having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things go our way, are we not?  It does not surprise us when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good things happen, when we get chances to do stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But people who are poor, uneducated, unhealthy, etc, do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get these chances.  This competition is open to *everyone*.
</em><br>
<p>No, it is not.  You are going to need highly competent and intelligent
<br>
people in such extreme and remote conditions.  A mere baby machine, as
<br>
some have proposed will not do at all.  When the needs are large,
<br>
resources are low and risks are high you cannot afford not to send the
<br>
best. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nowthen, please, everyone here, stop and think hard: what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills would *really* be *required* for an astronaut heading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Mars to start a colony?  I suggest these:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Determination to survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  Low weight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.  Very small appetite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4.  Ability to endure loneliness, but with the complementary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to endure more virtual &quot;company&quot; than one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly imagine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5.  Functional uterus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6.  Collection of frozen embryos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is idiotic.  What are these children supposed to survive on?  From
<br>
where do they get their tools?  By whom are they educated and cared
<br>
for?  By one great uterus woman picked mainly for that and low weight? 
<br>
And what if anything at all goes wrong in the decade and a half or so
<br>
that these children are not productive or dependable?  Give me a break.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Skills that astronauts have had in the past, but would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be needed for this mission.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Education (why would that be needed?)
</em><br>
<p>Sigh. For dealing with all the very complex things that can and are very
<br>
likely to go wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  Social graces
</em><br>
<p>Ever tried to live with dozens of children in very tight (not to mention
<br>
dangerous and hostile) quarters?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3.  Literacy (the messages could be translated to and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from voice.)
</em><br>
<p>Uh, right.  What about educating the children?  All done by learning
<br>
machines we don't have?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  English  (messages could be machine translated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from any language.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5.  Legs  (Where is she gonna go?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  I am getting taken in.  This is obviously sick parody.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Exactly where do you believe the money will come from to fund such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; misadventure?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goooood question.  The only reason I could think of for a business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enterprise to take this on is that the communications from the colony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be worth a cool fortune.  If one could figure out a way to
</em><br>
<p>Why would communication from an illterate cunt (since that is all you
<br>
are allowing)  and a pack of wild infants and ill-educated children from
<br>
millions of miles away at hideous cost be worth anything at all to
<br>
anyone?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; encrypt, receive and sell the email from Mars to those who are interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in what the Martians have to say, then private business might be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry the expense.  I would pay 10 bucks for a day's transmissions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for instance, and would likely pay that on a 3-4 times a month
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis.  I would estimate 10 million subscribers around the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so the payback would be worth about a 5 billion dollar investment.
</em><br>
<p>OK.  Say we find 10 million similarly bored and twisted people.  That is
<br>
$400 million a year.  The cost of the shot to put this thing on Mars is
<br>
around $50-100 billion minimum.  The cost of food, air, heat and so on
<br>
Mars is not easy to calculate as it depends on either sending enough
<br>
space factory that is utterly foolproof so said stupid cunt and her
<br>
brats can't screw it up or it will be send from earth either should at
<br>
least double the cost.  So it will take 50 years to pay the initial cost
<br>
from the contributions of interested net-geeks.  Wonderful   This
<br>
doesn't even account for subsequent costs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To get such a mission down to 5 billion, we would surely need to cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some corners, which is why I keep coming back to the single tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.  The lander would need to be very small, and of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry with it all the equipment needed to create an underground
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificially lit farm.  I agree it is a hell of a challenge.  A way cool one.
</em><br>
<p><p>It is impossible and too silly a parody to even be amusing.
