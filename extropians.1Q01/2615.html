Russell forwards a column by James C. Bennett:
<br>
<em>&gt; In California, some dim bulb (so to speak) had the amazing concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deregulating the prices power companies would have to pay to power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppliers for their power, without deregulating the price at which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could sell power to consumers.  They were supposed to make it up by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charging more to business customers, so that, in effect, businesses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (ultimately) their customers would subsidize the cost of energy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumers.  (This is exactly how phone service works in the US today).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, this stealth tax did not work (partly because businesses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just did not buy a large enough percentage of the power used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California) and the power companies are going bankrupt.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From what I've read about the crisis, this is not why the price freeze was
</em><br>
put into place.  It was actually done to benefit the utility companies,
<br>
to guarantee them profits.  At the time of deregulation wholesale prices
<br>
had been low for decades, and the reason for deregulation was to bring
<br>
down retail prices, which had remained stubbornly high.
<br>
<p>The utility companies were afraid that cutthroat competition would
<br>
drive down retail prices so low that they couldn't make a profit.
<br>
So they were protected with a price freeze.  The freeze would last
<br>
until the utilities had made a certain amount of profit that would
<br>
compensate them for the costs imposed on them as part of deregulation.
<br>
Once this level of profit was reached the freeze would be over.
<br>
<p>This worked as planned for the first couple of years but since 2000
<br>
everything has gone wrong.   Demand has outpaced supply and as a result
<br>
wholesale prices have risen above retail levels, which no one imagined.
<br>
As a result the utilities are no longer making money, they are losing
<br>
it hand over fist, and the price freeze is no longer protecting them,
<br>
it is hurting them.
<br>
