<em>&gt;But that is pointless. People have as much to say as they have to say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no more and no less.  Posters are not interchangeable, nor are posts.

</em><br>
<p>Here's an analogy:  Let's say you are at a meeting and one person dominates
<br>
the conversation.  I see an email list in a similar way.  Sometimes I'm
<br>
still thinking about a topic and formulating my reply and someone else has
<br>
already posted several times on the subject. While you might say that it is
<br>
pointless to tell this person that he or she might consider giving it a
<br>
beat or take a breather, I think its a matter of social grace.
<br>
<p>Another issue is someone discrediting another person's interest when in
<br>
fact much of what can be easily cast aside as not being &quot;extropian&quot; (I
<br>
never liked this mind-set) can be very beneficial to list members if they
<br>
broaden their perspectives.
<br>
<p>Yes,  this does pertain to trivial posts in part, but then again you might
<br>
argue that nothing is trivial and that each poster's post is not
<br>
interchangeable.  What might be trivial to me might not be trivial to
<br>
someone else.  It's a fine line in determining what works and doesn't work
<br>
on a list, that's why there are list quidelines.
