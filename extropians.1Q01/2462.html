<em>&gt;    &gt; Synthetic organs need to be kept in a sterile, temperature-controlled

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or a living body, and that's what we were talking about.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but this does not change my answer to your question, &quot;Why would 
<br>
hiding a few pounds worth of synthetic organs be more difficult....?&quot; 
<br>
Maintaining live organs is more difficult than storing nonliving 
<br>
materials.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; More people get high than replace organs.  A person can smoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; multiple joints per day, but will not replace multiple organs per day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And how much would you be willing to pay for one of those synthetic organs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if you would die without it? I imagine you'd pay every last cent you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had if needed.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but this does not change my answer to your question, &quot;Why would 
<br>
the demand for synthetic organs be less than the demand for 
<br>
marijuana?&quot;  There are simply more drug users than organ users.  Each 
<br>
drug user makes more drug transactions per week than an organ user is 
<br>
likely to make in a year.  Sheer volume of the drug trade outweighs 
<br>
the organ trade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;It takes a  higher caliber intellect to grow organs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So they'd be less likely to get caught.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but this does not change my answer to your question ,&quot;Why would 
<br>
you find few people... when many thousand take similar risks in the 
<br>
drug trade?&quot;  There are fewer high-caliber people capable of growing 
<br>
organs than there are lower-caliber people capable of running drugs. 
<br>
Common criminals, gang members, and unemployed people cannot be 
<br>
recruited to grow organs as easily as they can be recruited to run 
<br>
drugs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      &gt; Highly skilled people in this field could probably get rich 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with less risky
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; jobs in bioengineering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Only if they're selling something consumers value more than their lives.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to assume that medical doctors should be richer than 
<br>
entertainment providers.  The market does not work this way.  Movie 
<br>
stars and football players (and drug dealers) make more money than 
<br>
surgeons.  This is because total demand for movies and football games 
<br>
(and drugs) outweigh life-saving organ replacements.  Although the 
<br>
individual might value their life more than entertainment, the total 
<br>
profit margin on entertainment is more than on life-saving organs.
