<p>Actually, to say something sucks was once considered
<br>
vulgar speech.  The term has enjoyed considerable
<br>
amelioration in recent years however, perhaps after Her Majesty
<br>
the Queen of England was heard to utter, at a state dinner:
<br>
France sucks.

<p>Curious comment.  Have you not been to a gaming arcade
<br>
and seen the 8 yr olds working video games?  Many of the
<br>
preadolescent set are quite competent at the kinds of tasks
<br>
I can imagine our intrepid colonizers would face.
<br>
<p>We think of 18 yrs olds as the beginning of competence.
<br>
But the Mars colonist's children are freed from the need to
<br>
learn all the incredibly complicated lessons of how to survive
<br>
in modern society, replaced only with the incredibly
<br>
complicated lessons of how to survive.  spike
