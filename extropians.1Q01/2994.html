<em>&gt; Study Calls for Greater Use of Micropower

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today's giant coal and nuclear power plants are failing to provide the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-quality, reliable electricity needed to power the new digital economy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to a new report from the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DC-based research organization.
</em><br>
<p>False. This situation has been engineered by the Green opposition to
<br>
construction of new plants to meed demand. Increasing demand without new
<br>
supply has caused the current problems. This whole situation has been
<br>
engineered by Greens.
<br>
<p>That being said, is the goal of the Greens the same as our goals? With
<br>
centralized power generation, and so much of our lives dependent upon
<br>
centralized power, each of us can be put under seige by the power
<br>
oligopolists in the event of a popular revolt against alleged business
<br>
'control' of government, much as protesters can be starved out, we are
<br>
each hostage to statist control over our lives. Promoting
<br>
microgeneration serves the goals of all libertarians, however, don't
<br>
mistake the end goals of the Greens with libertarian or extropian end
<br>
goals. We both want to change society, but we want to do so in opposite
<br>
directions. If it comes to a showdown, one side will wind up on the
<br>
wall, and the other side will be firing the rifles, and we are likely to
<br>
be used just as the Mensheviks were used by the Bolsheviks in the 1917
<br>
revolution in Russia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The new micropower technologies, which include fuel cells, microturbines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and solar roofing, are as small as one-millionth the scale of today's coal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or nuclear plants, and produce little if any of the air pollution of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger cousins. 
</em><br>
<p>This is false. They all produce the same, if not more, pollution than
<br>
their larger cousins, on a pollution per watt basis.
