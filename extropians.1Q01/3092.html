<p>Nobel Brains To Tackle World's Problems
<br>
<p>By Alister Doyle
<br>
Reuters
<br>
<p>OSLO, Norway (Feb. 2) - About 225 Nobel Prize winners will tackle the world's 
<br>
ills in one of the biggest concentrations of brain power in history in 
<br>
December to mark the 100th anniversary of the awards, organizers said Friday. 
<br>
<p>About 32 Nobel Peace Prize winners, including former Soviet President Mikhail 
<br>
Gorbachev and Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, will gather in Oslo 
<br>
for a December 6-8 symposium on how the globe can avoid conflicts in the 21st 
<br>
century. 
<br>
<p>Around the same time, many of the almost 200 laureates in physics, chemistry, 
<br>
medicine, literature and economics will converge on Sweden to wrestle with 
<br>
issues like &quot;frontiers in molecular science,&quot; &quot;beyond genes&quot; and &quot;witness 
<br>
literature.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Laureates will also speak at universities in the two nations, and Sweden will 
<br>
set up an exhibition to mark the first century of the prizes, named after 
<br>
Sweden's Alfred Nobel, a philanthropist and the inventor of dynamite. 
<br>
<p>The celebrations will culminate on December 10 when this year's awards are 
<br>
handed out a century after the first prize was awarded in 1901. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We've never had such a big meeting of peace prize winners,&quot; said Geir 
<br>
Lundestad, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We'll go through what went wrong in the 20th century -- why we had so many 
<br>
wars and conflicts -- and we'll try to sketch out solutions for the 21st,&quot; he 
<br>
said. 
<br>
<p>FINDING SOLUTIONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY 
<br>
<p>&quot;The prize winners will, as the visionaries, try to give us solutions for the 
<br>
21st century,&quot; he said, adding that all living laureates have been invited. 
<br>
<p>Former South African President Nelson Mandela is the only Nobel laureate 
<br>
invited who has said he won't be coming, although other laureates like 
<br>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat have yet to reply. 
<br>
<p>Mandela, who shared the 1993 prize with former President F.W. de Klerk for 
<br>
helping bury apartheid, gave no reason for turning down the invitation. 
<br>
<p>Of the total peace laureates, 17 are individuals, including Northern Irish 
<br>
politicians John Hume and David Trimble, who won in 1998 for efforts to end 
<br>
sectarian bloodshed, and 15 represent organizations like the U.N. 
<br>
peacekeeping forces.
