<br>
<p><p>Stem Cell Supporter Thompson Approved by Senate, Sworn in, as HHS Secretary
<br>
The Senate unanimously confirmed Tommy Thompson to lead the Department of 
<br>
Health and Human Services.
<br>
One question Thompson will have a say in as secretary is whether federal 
<br>
money can be used for stem cell research, which shows promise in the 
<br>
treatment of catastrophic diseases such as Alzheimer's.
<br>
Thompson told an audience of HHS employees at his swearing in ceremony that 
<br>
he will review federal policy over use of embryonic stem cells for medical 
<br>
research.
<br>
Without divulging specifics, Thompson responded to questions by HHS workers 
<br>
by saying that he would review policy on use of stem cells, many of which 
<br>
come from discarded human embryos.
<br>
The cells are being used in research toward a cure for Parkinson's, 
<br>
Alzheimer's and numerous other diseases. President Bush has implied that he 
<br>
opposes this sort of research, but Thompson, as governor, heaped praise on 
<br>
University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers who codiscovered the vital cells.
<br>
When asked about his earlier comments on stem cell research, Thompson said 
<br>
his position may have to change. &quot;I found out that I'm a cabinet officer 
<br>
now,&quot; he said.
<br>
It has been reported that Bush may issue executive orders that would 
<br>
nullify the federal stem cell research guidelines, in addition to helping 
<br>
AIDS drug manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline PLC, hurting RU-486 &quot;abortion pill&quot; 
<br>
sponsor Danco Group, and making it easier for smaller construction bidders 
<br>
like Custom Comforts USA Inc. to avoid union labor.
<br>
Anti-abortion activists have asked Bush to reverse Clinton administration 
<br>
decisions that allowed federal funding of research that uses stem cell 
<br>
tissue from embryos and aborted fetuses.
<br>
Bush does &quot;not have to wait for Congress to act to begin to fulfill&quot; his 
<br>
&quot;pledge to protect the lives of unborn children,&quot; the Christian Defense 
<br>
Coalition and Generation Life wrote Bush.
<br>
<p>Bush Stance on Stem Cell Research a Little Fuzzy
<br>
It is still unclear whether President Bush will seek to rescind NIH 
<br>
guidelines on federally funded stem cell research. He did say, however, 
<br>
that he is opposed to research involving aborted human fetuses. Bush said 
<br>
that federal money should not be used for research on fetal tissue or on 
<br>
so-called stem cells derived from abortions.
<br>
&quot;I do not support research from aborted fetuses,&quot; Bush said.
<br>
He did not say whether he would move to block federal research funding, an 
<br>
act that many scientists say could stop promising research into therapies 
<br>
for numerous diseases. Aides said afterward he was signaling his intent to 
<br>
do so.
<br>
Bush had indicated his opposition to such research during the presidential 
<br>
campaign, but the remarks in late January were his first on the topic since 
<br>
taking over the White House.
<br>
&quot;I will let you know when I decide all policy decisions, but the answer to 
<br>
your question is no,&quot; Bush said when asked whether he believes federal 
<br>
money should be spent on fetal-tissue and stem-cell research from abortions.
<br>
After a presidential campaign in which anti-abortion conservatives were a 
<br>
cornerstone of his support, Bush moved on Monday, two days into his 
<br>
presidency, to restore restrictions on US foreign aid to family-planning 
<br>
organizations involved in abortion. His administration also promised a 
<br>
review of the government's approval of the RU-486 abortion pill.
<br>
Bush did not specifically address embryonic stem cells.
<br>
&quot;I believe there's some wonderful opportunities for adult stem cell 
<br>
research,&quot; Bush said. &quot;I believe we can find stem cells from fetuses that 
<br>
died a natural death, but I do not support research from aborted fetuses.&quot;
<br>
He commented in a question-and-answer session during a meeting with 
<br>
Democratic and Republican governors.
<br>
Bush stopped short Friday of saying whether or how he might block the NIH 
<br>
funding.
<br>
<p>Bioresearch Orgs Appeal to Bush to Keep Funding Stem Cell Research
<br>
One hundred and twenty-three life sciences research and advocacy groups on 
<br>
January 17 sent a letter to then President-elect Bush asking him to 
<br>
carefully consider the issue of stem cell research and asking him to allow 
<br>
this research to move forward with federal support.
<br>
The letter made the point that &quot;adult&quot; stem cell research is not a viable 
<br>
alternative to embryonic stem cell research.
<br>
NIH guidelines on the conduct of federally funded stem cell research offer 
<br>
careful federal oversight for the research, the letter said. HHS Secretary 
<br>
Tommy Thompson's staff has expressed willingness to work with those groups 
<br>
who support this research, but have yet to call a meeting.
<br>
Among the groups that signed the letter were the Alliance for Aging 
<br>
Research, The ALS Association, American Pediatric Society, American Society 
<br>
for Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology, The American Society for Cell 
<br>
Biology, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Association of 
<br>
Independent Research Institutes, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, 
<br>
Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, Parkinson's Action Network, the 
<br>
WiCell Research Institute, and several leading biomedical research 
<br>
universities.
<br>
Group Says Poll Shows American Support For Stem Cell Research
<br>
<p>Lastly, more than twice as many Americans support federal funding of stem 
<br>
cell research than oppose it, a poll commissioned by the Juvenile Diabetes 
<br>
Research Foundation International (JDRF) found.
<br>
In the poll, conducted from January 12th to January 15th, 65 percent of 
<br>
those surveyed said they support federal funding, while only 26 percent 
<br>
opposed it (the remaining 9 percent of respondents answered &quot;don't know&quot;). 
<br>
The poll surveyed 1,004 Americans and was conducted by Opinion Research 
<br>
Corporation International.
<br>
&quot;We believe this poll is a very significant signal from the American people 
<br>
that federal funding for stem cell research should continue, and we agree,&quot; 
<br>
said Peter Van Etten, President and CEO of JDRF.
<br>
Prior to asking respondents the question which specifically addressed 
<br>
federal funding for stem cell research, the following definition of the 
<br>
research was given: &quot;As you may already know, a stem cell is the basic cell 
<br>
in the body from which all other cells arise. Medical researchers have been 
<br>
able to isolate stem cells from excess human embryos developed through in 
<br>
vitro fertilization and fetal tissue that has been donated to research. The 
<br>
medical researchers believe that human stem cells can be developed into 
<br>
replacement cells to cure diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's, 
<br>
Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, burns, or spinal cord 
<br>
problems.&quot; After hearing the definition, 65 percent of respondents said 
<br>
they favored the funding of stem cell research by the National Institutes 
<br>
of Health (NIH).
