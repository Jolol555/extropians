</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;Absolutely.

<em>&gt; I don't understand. Why should ancient Sumerian fairytales be more profound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 19'th century European fairytales?
</em><br>
<p>**Because they can teach us something about the first confirmed human

civilization--which Mother Goose, last time I checked, could not. 
<br>
Though perhaps it's been revised...

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt;     &gt;Einstein is generally acknowledged to have been,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; primarily, a mathematician.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Baloney! Einstein was never interested in mathematics in itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only in what it could do. His contribution to pure mathematics is precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero, he never even tried to do more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;He had little professional contact or acces to the literature of physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some truth to that, because of anti-Semitism he couldn't get a job at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; university and he was a bit out of the main stream of physics working at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patent office, but to say he wasn't trained as a physicist is ridiculous, he got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his Ph.D. in 1905 for goodness sake. I'd call a Ph.D. training.
</em><br>
<p>**After he had done much important work.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;the biggest  breakthroughs often come from those outside the fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;affected by the breakthroughs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know about that but I'll tell you one thing, the biggest crackpots certainly do.
</em><br>
<p>**Almost always!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And by the way, that famous quote you like from Einstein &quot;God Does Not Play Dice&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well we now know he was almost certainly wrong about that. God is a dice playing fool,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fact He not only plays dice He sometimes rolls them where they can't be seen.
</em><br>
<p>**What a Character, huh? We'll just have to ask Him about that one 
<br>
day...
