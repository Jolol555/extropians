<p>How is that an ad-hominem? It was totally contextual. Individuals in
<br>
your society are more willing to enslave themselves to any thug that
<br>
comes along, whether it be a government thug, mobster, or freelance
<br>
criminal. Yes, I said slavery. I don't consider fractional confiscation
<br>
of the product of one's labor to be any more morally acceptable than
<br>
full confiscation. Whether you call it taxation, mugging, B&amp;E,
<br>
pickpocketing, etc is irrelevant. I see no difference between enslaving
<br>
10% of a society or confiscating 10% of everyone's productivity.

<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>I live in a society with a homicide rate lower than yours (New
<br>
Hampshire). I don't consider the big cities that have stringent gun
<br>
control laws to be 'my society', and it is there that 90% of the crime
<br>
occurs. Big cities in the US tend toward the 'low-trust' form typical of
<br>
many european countries, while rural areas in the US are high trust
<br>
societies.

<p>Canada's rate was 2.6 per 100,000, which is the same as the average of
<br>
the ten lowest ranking states, which, you'll notice all are states with
<br>
rather lax gun control laws (as reflected in the weapons offense
<br>
rankings), but are demographically very similar to Canada (and Great
<br>
Britain). Thus the idea that violent crime is a demographical
<br>
phenomenon, not one of increasing regulation or law enforcement,
<br>
requires serious consideration.
<br>
<p>Because of this compelling demographic link, this supports Greg's
<br>
comments about low-trust versus high-trust ethnic groups. Britain's
<br>
violent crime rates have risen and fallen in direct proportion to
<br>
immigration rates, as has crime rates in the US and Canada. Crime is a
<br>
phenomenon engaged in primarily by demographic groups from low-trust
<br>
societies that are unsufficiently integrated into mainstream society,
<br>
either due to prejudice and ostracism by the majority, insularity of the
<br>
unintegrated group, or due to a high rate of immigration of that
<br>
demographic group on an ongoing basis overwhelming the ability of local
<br>
high-trust standards to prevail.
<br>
<p>Britain is an interesting case to study. One could say that they evolved
<br>
from a high trust society to a low trust society by two concurrent
<br>
methods: first, individualistic types tended to leave or be ejected,
<br>
primarily emigrating to the United States, where individuals could form
<br>
a high-trust society; secondly, individuals from low-trust societies
<br>
were imported, either as slaves, refugees, or willing immigrants, that
<br>
eventually dissolved and changed the trust 'pH' of the society to a
<br>
low-trust one, especially during the 20th century.
