<p>Excellent. OpenSource (Linux, *BSD, Apache, Zope, Python, etc.) is going to see
<br>
much more use in future. In fact so much use, that Redmond is heading towards
<br>
big trouble, unless they straighten out their act quickly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; world coding, you very rarely get to choose your tools; they are part of the

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you can choose your employers or clients, if you're a contractor,
<br>
not only for the compensation, but for a) satisfaction it gives you b) building
<br>
skills for the future c) by steering the marketplace by concerted action (if 
<br>
you've got religion).
<br>
<p>If a client dictates you use of broken tools with zero flexibility, perhaps 
<br>
he's not the right client for you. Unless you absolutely, positively need
<br>
that contract, or you go broke.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I highly recommend ASP, on IIS, with SQL Server backend, as a good starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of employable skills. I'm currently working using this set of products,
</em><br>
<p>There are many employable skills right now. SAP, Oracle, Java. (Though I wonder
<br>
how long it takes until the Java backlash will begin. Or until the damn thing
<br>
matures, it is taking it's sweet time).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with the caveat that the same products must also support Oracle, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caveat that javascript is used for ASP programming rather than VBScript, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very sound choice.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I choose cholera over plague every time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Some of the purists will come out of the woodwork and attack me for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint. It does sound like a banal and colourless life. Don't be fooled;
</em><br>
<p>Nope, you're paying your bills and having fun in the prospect. No point in
<br>
ruining all this by getting religion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the mainstream technology is not only rewarding in a financial sense, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun. It's fun because it keeps changing at a crazy pace. When you've got
</em><br>
<p>Sure, unfortunately it doesn't go anywhere particular. It looks rather brownian,
<br>
one step forwards, two back, one sideways, one forward, iterate. I like change
<br>
a lot, but I like change with a purpose even more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; most of the coders, and most of the install base, you can afford to put a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of effort into development. This means things are rarely ever the same,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is damned hard, but always interesting.
</em><br>
<p>Which means you have to have the proper personality structure to appreciate it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Note also; I've had a lot of jobs, and never used even similar sets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills/languages from one job to the next; the primary language to use, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, has always been entirely new to me. That's not uncommon. So
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the opposite is also true. A good C programmer under Unix has
<br>
an employable history of almost three decades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there's no need to get cut up on becoming a specialist in language X or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; database Y. Just get really good at learning.
</em><br>
<p>Good advice.
