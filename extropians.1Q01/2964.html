<p>If you think conventional manned spaceflight, missions would be
<br>
expensive. If you think industrial exploration, then we're talking
<br>
about some ten gigabucks bootstrapping costs, most of it R&amp;D on
<br>
the ground. The more time and effort you spend on the ground, the
<br>
lesser the size of the seed you have actually deliver. After then,
<br>
it's about the biggest revenue bringer there is, and will soon make
<br>
terrestrial industrial output look like a mosquito fart.

<p>The problem is not money, the problem is lack of attitude. As you
<br>
might have noticed, we haven't been to the Moon in a while, but apparently
<br>
can afford to dump MIR and keep the idiotic ISS afloat. If you'd
<br>
sink into space R&amp;D 5% of what people spend yearly for soccer for a
<br>
decade, you'd be surprised at the result.
