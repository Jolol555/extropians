<p>Oh, god... do I have to explain about how most people are happy

really have to explain that if you take away everyone's right to

<br>
fringe who aren't bound by social constraints?
<br>
<p>I think that you're delighting in being, as someone already pointed 
<br>
out, obtuse.
<br>
<p>Plus, you cut the sentence that already explained who would be going

over the line if groping assaults were legal:
