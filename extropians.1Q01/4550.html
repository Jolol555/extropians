<p>I am confused about why people still think the media mis-called the 
<br>
election.  I think it is now clear that Gore won the popular vote, 
<br>
including in Florida.  More people indicated that they thought they 
<br>
voted for Gore in the exit polls.  The prediction of the election 
<br>
according to the exit polls clearly went to Gore.  The media clearly 
<br>
predicted Gore as the winner based on exit polls.  The exit polls 
<br>
still match the number of botched or discounted ballots.  There is no 
<br>
reason to believe that the exit poll was wrong.  As far as I can 
<br>
tell, the media reported the exit polls correctly.  The election 
<br>
problems occurred later in the counting, not with the exit poll 
<br>
sampling.
