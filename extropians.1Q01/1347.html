<em>&gt; Pure unadulterated optimism, to put it bluntly, is unrealistic -- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody knows it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Charlie
</em><br>
<p>But optimism is only a useful concept in an unclear environment. If it were
<br>
clear that outcomes would be good, there would be no need for optimism; only
<br>
acceptance of a predictable destiny.
<br>
<p>(Optimism/Pessimism/Other guiding principle) is something that you adopt in
<br>
the face of lack of information; you use it to help make decisions when
<br>
there is no reasonable way to make a choice. For instance, after debating
<br>
nanotech ad nauseam, we don't seem to be any closer to deciding if we should
<br>
pursue it or not (or even if that is a valid option). So, we must retreat to
<br>
core values, and say &quot;Well, I'm optimistic about people and the future;
<br>
let's do it&quot;.
<br>
<p>Pure unadulterated optimism is a cause for concern, because it begins to
<br>
intrude on situations where the facts would otherwise speak clearly; where a
<br>
more moderate approach might be better advised. I see that a bit in the GM
<br>
discussions on this list; anyone intending to shop from a list of GM foods
<br>
is clearly pushing a barrow, rather than employing reason.
<br>
<p>But we can still have a lot of optimism. It's one of the guiding principles
<br>
of this list, and is quite out in the open. We take a solid combined
<br>
knowledge of &quot;the way things are&quot;, informed projections of the possible &quot;way
<br>
things could be&quot;, and colour that with optimism, faith in humanity. Ta-da,
<br>
what pops out is a future worth believing in. And, to the extent that we
<br>
make the future we envisage and pursue, it is socially responsible to-boot.
