<em>&gt; 2008 is near enough that I can almost taste it.  Let's see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what do **I** expect for 2008?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  On the computer front,  we'll be in the 2005-2010 timeframe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for those next-generation chip-manufacturing technologies that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (EUV) lithography, .07 micron line widths (IIRC), 10 gigahertz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clock rates, etc.  Perhaps 64-bit processors will be in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream by then, if the Itanium doesn't flop.  This will all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be on the typical desktop, along with RAM in the gigabyte
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range, hard-disk storage in the hundreds of gigabytes.  With that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of processing power on the desktop, decent multimedia even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via low-bandwidth Internet is practical.
</em><br>
<p>You're a little bit too conservative here. AMD will have out two 64-bit
<br>
processors by the end of this year/early next year. One may have a double
<br>
core on single die (Sledgehammer). If Moore's Law continues at current
<br>
18 month doubling rate then by 2008, then you would be looking at between
<br>
4 and 5 doublings by then of the 2ghz chips that will be available near
<br>
end of this year. So I would put it closer to 20ghz. I believe Seagate has
<br>
already announced a 150GB hard drive to be shipping this quarter. By 2008
<br>
you should expect hmm maybe 2TB drives would be pretty cheap? And don't
<br>
think low bandwidth since most likely the average consumer Net connection
<br>
in the US will be at least 100mbit if not 1gbit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  On the networking front, we may have really-high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwidth, guaranteed-service Internet 2 for the national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labs and big universities -- something that could support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surgery by telepresence, for example.  Probably no more people will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have access to this in 2008 than had access to the Internet in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early 80's.  On the consumer front, Internet adoption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will probably have reached saturation (in the U.S. at least), at whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage that turns out to be; broadband penetration will still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creeping along, and decent-speed, relatively cheap wireless Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access may prove to be the next big consumer app.  I guess my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; office (at work) will be wired with gigabit Ethernet.
</em><br>
<p>There are companies now wiring office buildings with fiber, and offering
<br>
100mbit feeds for $1000/month. Bandwidth is the one commodity doubling even
<br>
faster than hard drives and chips. Fiber and fiberless optics to the home,
<br>
and other techniques will make 100mbit at least as common as DSL/cable modems
<br>
are today in 2008. Heck even VDSL over copper can get you over 50mbit. ADSL
<br>
and cable modem technology is about where we were with 2400 baud analog modems.
<br>
Plenty of room for improvement in last mile techniques.
<br>
<p>And don't forget about wireless Net which will provide slower speeds (2mbit
<br>
by 2008?) but allow pretty much all countries on the planet to offer some form
<br>
of basic broadband access to every consumer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.  On the bio front, I have no idea.  Anti-aging therapy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smart drugs?  Better treatments for cancer, heart disease,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alzheimers?  Who the hell knows?  But my expectations are rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative on this front.
</em><br>
<p>All of above hopefully
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, that's the surprise-free scenario.  There is another possibility:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5.  There will be a major paradigm shift of some sort.  A breakthrough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the third dimension of micro-scale electronic circuitry, as Kurzweil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anticipates.  Molecular-scale computing.  Optical computing.  Quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing.
</em><br>
<p>Right, I fully expect some kind of molecular electronics to be available by
<br>
then. RAM could be had in super-huge quantities for super-cheap. CPUs might
<br>
become super-powerful. This is almost for sure by 2008.
<br>
<p>The computing power is not going to be a problem for Singularity in 2008.
<br>
Between the chip speeds then, and the relatively fast bandwidth available
<br>
to connect them all together, it will be possible.
