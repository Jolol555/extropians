<em>&gt;Subject: Re: Cryonics on ABC World News Tonight

<em> &gt;

<em>&gt;I think he said, &quot;I know it's serious; I was going to, but my producer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is telling me in my ear that I should not.&quot; Then he went on to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would be possible to chat with Robert Ettinger on-line when the show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was over. It was confusing, but I think he had been going to make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;joke about cryonics and was being advised not to by the producer.
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;IMO it just goes to show how disreputable cryonics is, that after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;following his script and dutifully giving the segment a respectful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lead-in, Jennings felt compelled to distance himself from the story by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his chuckle and almost-joke. Imagine if Jennings had reacted similarly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to a story on possible cures for cystic fibrosis or ALS. It's impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We see from this how far cryonics remains from the mainstream.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think it goes to show how it's VIEWED as &quot;disreputable&quot;, but mainly shows 
<br>
how what seems to have been a fairly level-headed report can be downgraded 
<br>
by the attempted smart comments of one ignorant reporter.  I'm gratified to 
<br>
see that he got &quot;slapped down&quot; for it in some measure.
<br>
<p>It's funny, but the things people have a good laugh at tend to be the same 
<br>
things they recoil in horror from 10 or so years later when it's come to 
<br>
fruition.
<br>
<p>Maybe someday we'll learn to overcome this &quot;programmed&quot; behaviour.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
