</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Three things:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;1. It makes it hard for prison officers to maintain order. (If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your prisoners hope to get time off for good behaviour, they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a positive incentive to behave themselves. This is a very useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lever if you're thinking in terms of getting criminals to reform.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It also makes it less likely that an inmate will attack a prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt;officer.)
</em><br>
<p>While I would normally agree that positive reinforcement is to be
<br>
prefered, I think these are the very people on whom negative
<br>
reinforcement might be more effective, i.e. sentence extensions for
<br>
negative actions, make them responsible for their actions. How many
<br>
are fooled by the false hope parole often is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;2. Where parole is abolished, it is seldom accompanied by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reduction in sentencing guidelines. If a regime exists where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parole of up to 25% of the sentence is available, and parole is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then abolished, this is almost never accompanied by a 25%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reduction in sentences handed out by the courts. Thus, the net
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect is to increase the severity of sentencing significantly. 
</em><br>
<p>I've never understood the parole system that well, every petty thug
<br>
can quote you how long he's likely to get for whatever crime they
<br>
are likely to commit, they already know the price and often can
<br>
make an excellent guess of how likely they are to get away with
<br>
what. This seems to be part of the problem.
<br>
<p>I see no reason where any adjusting of sentence length can be part
<br>
of the same bill that does away with parole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;3.It also _really_ pisses off and demotivates any inmates who've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been behaving themselves in hope of qualifying for early release,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just in time to be shafted by a change in the law -- see outcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;#1 above.
</em><br>
<p>No reason we can't change the rules and create a system where the
<br>
harder someone works at his own rehabilitation the shorter the
<br>
sentence. Say for starters getting a GED.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Basically, as long as an inmate has something to *hope* for, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have an incentive to reform, behave themselves well, and return to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civil society. Take away all rewards for cooperation, and why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should they bother? 
</em><br>
<p>Sounds great in theory, works lousy in practice. I'm not saying
<br>
take away incentive, I'm saying change the incentive, the harder
<br>
you work to rehabilitate, the shorter the sentence. Sounds like it
<br>
might work better than trying to instill docile behavior.
