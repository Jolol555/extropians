<p>Well, yes, but of course I was trying to explicate what it *is* about
<br>
`nature' that distinguishes its processes and products from human `designed
<br>
culture'. 
<br>
<p>And why it often makes a lot of sense to give priority to the former (or at
<br>
least not to screw it up opportunistically and without concern for its
<br>
webwork integrity), to the extent that its evolved complexity has tested
<br>
Vastly more options than human brain simulations.
<br>
<p>In other words, I'm asserting that some such implicit analysis underlies
<br>
many people's preference for `nature' over `human constructions', to the
<br>
extent that people actually *do* have such a preference. By and large I
<br>
don't suppose they do, since most people are only too eager to intervene in
<br>
the world without having a clue what they're doing, and most First Worlders
<br>
at least would not relish being returned to the wild to enjoy its natural
<br>
pleasures: danger, hunger and thirst, illness, ravenous beasts, all the
<br>
obvious deficits.
