</em><br>

the

<p>Ugh - I read this with dread.  As someone who has always gotten pleasure out 
<br>
of high-performance cars (and other machines) (see: 
<br>
<a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch3/cars.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch3/cars.html</a>), I sincerely hope this kind of 
<br>
technology WILL be used to improve the safety and reliability of autos and 
<br>
other transportation technology, but that it won't tempt the nannies to 
<br>
castrate high-performance cars.
<br>
<p>What I wouldn't at all mind seeing and something I've thought about before is 
<br>
employing technology to allow multiple classes of driver's licenses and to 
<br>
regulate speed in proportion to a machine's capabilities and the road 
<br>
conditions it encounters.  I would gladly pay more for, take a test to get 
<br>
and tolerate some slight intrusion into my road-going privacy to be able to 
<br>
legally drive faster than current law allows.  
<br>
<p>How about this:  One can take a test for one's self, submit one's car to 
<br>
periodic inspection and testing and pay more for a &quot;High Performance Driver's 
<br>
License&quot;.  Certified training at something like the Skip Barber driving 
<br>
schools might be a pre-requisite.  In it's full-blown &quot;smart' form, such a 
<br>
system would allow one to activate the &quot;high-performance&quot; feature of one's 
<br>
car/license on open roads, which would then initiate a special session of 
<br>
two-way communication to the road system.  The road network would sense the 
<br>
traffic and weather conditions and then allow you to drive up to some 
<br>
fraction of the limits of your combined car and driver rating under the 
<br>
existing conditions.  The car reports real-time data on its operations to the 
<br>
road system, such as tire pressure and temperature, lateral acceleration, 
<br>
excessive yaw, vibration and aerodynamic downforce.  Exceeding the car's 
<br>
&quot;rating&quot; on any of these parameters would change the limit at which the car 
<br>
would be able to operate.  Under the such a system, there are lots of places 
<br>
here in Texas where I could run my 'vette up to the drag limit (~160-180 mph 
<br>
- a nice safe margin, since Car and Driver magazine determined that the side 
<br>
windows on my car tend to blow out from Bornoulli Effect above c. 200 mph; 
<br>
something you can fix with duct tape, but which doesn't look so hot).
