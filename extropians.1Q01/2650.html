<p>It does indeed. I like it!

<p><em>&gt;did you make any big changes in

</em><br>
<p>I've tried to make the opening a bit more accessible to a general audience,
<br>
and I've updated as many technological examples as I could (since the
<br>
original was written in 1996), and the largest change is a long closing
<br>
chapter where I tried to bring together brief summaries of various thinkers
<br>
on how and when a singularity would occur. It concludes triumphantly with
<br>
none other than (tah-rah!) that bright spark E. Yudkowsky, of the coveted
<br>
Singularity Institute for Outlandish Claims and Ambitious Aspirations.

<p><em>&gt;I hope you didn't start bad mouthing that splendid

<p>I would never do that. The man has some scary ideas about uploading, but
<br>
I'm very grateful for his help and continued interest. On the other hand, I
<br>
haven't heard a peep out of Augustine, his opponent in the argument; I do
<br>
provide the URL to his `Geniebusters' site. (Nor have I heard from Dan
<br>
Clemmensen, whom I still quote; he seems to have fallen off the transhuman
<br>
map. You lurking out there, Dan?)
<br>
<p>Ahem; might I suggest, for the good of the memes (not to mention my bank
<br>
balance) that any reader from this forum who finds the book good and the
<br>
topic important should send a brief `review' saying so to amazon.com or
<br>
barnes&amp;noble.com. Anyone who regards the book as deplorable rubbish should,
<br>
of course, remain mute.
