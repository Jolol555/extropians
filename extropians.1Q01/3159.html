Chocolate fatigue
<br>
<p>Researchers study effects of chocolate chip deprivation
<br>
<p>by Susan Griffith
<br>
<p>The sugary smell of melted butter and baked cookie dough mingles in the
<br>
air with the rich aroma of hot chocolate as the latest batch of
<br>
chocolate chip
<br>
cookies comes out of the oven.
<br>
<p>How much strength does it take to resist eating a freshly baked
<br>
chocolate chip cookie?
<br>
<p>In a self-control study based on 67 undergraduate psychology students,
<br>
Ellen Bratslavsky and Roy Baumeister found that students who were asked
<br>
to
<br>
refrain from eating chocolate chip cookies had less strength to complete
<br>
a subsequent mental task.
<br>
<p>Students who were allowed to eat the cookies or were offered no cookies
<br>
at all performed at twice the level of those who were asked to resist.
<br>
<p>Bratslavsky and Baumeister presented their findings on &quot;Self Control
<br>
Fatigue After Resisting Temptation: The Cost of Not Eating Chocolate&quot; at
<br>
the
<br>
American Psychological Association meeting in Toronto in August.
<br>
<p>Bratslavsky, a graduate student working on her master's thesis, placed
<br>
the cookies in front the students in the first group, but instead of
<br>
offering them
<br>
a cookie, she asked them to chew on a radish until she was ready to
<br>
serve the cookies.
<br>
<p>Through a one-way mirror, Bratslavsky observed some students squirming
<br>
in their chairs as the tantalizing aroma permeated the room. Others took
<br>
<p>nibbles at the radish, and some even picked up the cookies and stared
<br>
longingly at the forbidden treat.
<br>
<p>Then comes the long-awaited moment when the students think they may have
<br>
a cookie. Instead, the students are given a subsequent task of
<br>
completing an unsolvable puzzle while waiting an additional 15 minutes.
<br>
<p>The researchers found that those asked to refrain from eating the
<br>
cookies made less than half the attempts to solve the puzzle before
<br>
giving up than
<br>
those who were allowed to eat the cookies immediately or were offered
<br>
none at all.
<br>
<p>The lesson learned here is that self-control is a limited resource.
<br>
&quot;When people exert self-control -- such as when under stress or
<br>
pressure, or when
<br>
dieting or coping -- self-control may fail in other spheres,&quot; says
<br>
Baumeister, professor of psychology.
<br>
<p>&quot;Resisting temptation is often morally necessary, but it has a
<br>
psychological cost,&quot; adds Bratslavsky.
<br>
<p>As a well holds only so much water, Baumeister says an individual only
<br>
has so much strength in self-control. Instead of taking on several
<br>
changes in
<br>
one's life that require self-control, he suggests working on one at a
<br>
time, or the individual may face failure.
