<p>By the way, there's a nice article on the global phenomenon that is sushi in 
<br>
the Nov/Dec 2000 issue of _Foreign_Policy_ magazine.  Unfortunately their 
<br>
web archive is still &quot;under construction,&quot; so only the current issue is 
<br>
available online; they say their full archive will be available soon.
<br>
<p>I had some delicious sushi the other night in Hong Kong.  What struck me was 
<br>
the lengths the chefs will go to, to make the raw fish dishes visually 
<br>
appealing; fish cut thin to the point of being translucent seems to be in.  
<br>
One offering I tried which I hadn't seen before: raw sea urchin; not bad, 
<br>
but I wouldn't particularly recommend it.
<br>
<p>My friend who took me is an American expat who speaks both Japanese and 
<br>
Cantonese, the Chinese dialect of the region (as well as Mandarin and a 
<br>
couple Romance languages).  He didn't speak a word of Japanese at this 
<br>
place, though: all Cantonese, a small indicator of the continual worldwide 
<br>
rise in popularity of this delicious and healthy Japanese dish, which in the 
<br>
_FP_ article is enlisted as a sort of metaphor for modern globalization.
<br>
<p>I'm now in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), but ran across a sushi place today, no 
<br>
doubt catering to Japanese businessmen.  May try it later.  The best 
<br>
combination between quality of sushi and price I've yet found is in 
<br>
Brooklyn, of all places, in restaurants run by Chinese immigrants.
<br>
<p>Best to all,
<br>
<p>Bill Douglass
