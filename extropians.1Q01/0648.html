<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;The best way to know when an extremist is about to attack is to listen to them get indignantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;defensive, which typically happens whenever someone does not absolutely agree with them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;concerning their pet issue; some sort of physical intimidation or verbal flame is sure to

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;follow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, _very_ true. And, contrariwise, attacks are not the only sign of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; extremism, any more than workplace shootings are the only sign of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; utterly unhappy worker. But not all extremists, it seems to me, attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; directly. Some attack indirectly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;News flash: I'll be getting more soon, but I just found out through my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;father that one of the Wakefield victims was a friend of my father and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his coworkers at Ruger. This man was an FFL holder, and a two time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;president of SCAT, a shooting club near Wakefield. Because company
</em><br>
<em>&gt;policy prohibited firearms in the workplace, he had no firearm to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;himself and his coworkers in the building during the shooting (a policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which the assailant evidently did not obey), despite having a difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to obtain Massachusetts Concealed Weapons Permit. One more statistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that only law abiding people obey gun laws, and die for it every day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Yes, Joe, this does belong on exi-freedom... i do encourage everyone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;move it over there....)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Which is why it never should have been posted here in the first place. BTW, three cheers to Colorado and Oregon; the voters in those states took their schoolhouse mass murders seriously, and passed referendums mandating background checks at gun shows prior to purchase.
