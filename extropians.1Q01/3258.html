<em>&gt; &gt; A &quot;felon&quot; is simply and only a person convicted of breaking certain
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; felonies, irrational or not.  The *felon* is first and foremost a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different rules apply is extremely dangerous.  If rights came only from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being a &quot;citizen&quot; then the argument might makes sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is why I said 'non-citizen' versus 'non-person'. Non-citizens here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US are restricted in many areas: they cannot carry concealed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons or own guns (because as non-citizens, they are not part of or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eligible to belong to the 'militia', organized or unorganized, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made up of all voter-eligible citizens).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe the Bill of Rights restricts human rights to citizens
<br>
only. Nor do I see anything in the 2nd amendment limiting it to
<br>
voter-eligible citizens.  When women could not vote (up to less than a
<br>
century ago) did we have no right to self-defense?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; A felon is in a state of what is called 'civil disability', meaning that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to their criminal convictions, they are disabled from belonging to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the militia, and from engaging in many other activities which are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural right of people, especially those who are citizens. A felon can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regain the right to vote and keep and bear arms by petitioning the court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for 'relief from civil disability' after three years of good behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following the conclusion of their sentence (which includes probation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree that &quot;militia&quot; is the important term in the 2nd amendment
<br>
or that some particular notion of &quot;militia&quot; should limit the
<br>
individual's right to self-defense.  I don't agree that the government
<br>
can legtimately strip me of rights at any time simply by declaring
<br>
something I do a felony.  I don't agree it is up to a court to deign to
<br>
return rights to me the government had no business claiming to own and
<br>
dole out to start with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are right to be concerned about 'slippery slopes' if government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decides to make a large percent of the population into felons, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I've said before, people tend to get the government they deserve. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough people wanted that sort of government, they are going to get it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether they like the results or not. This occured in both Germany and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Italy, where the concept of natural rights was non-existent. Here, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, the logic is that government can only suspend one's rights for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrating an inability to use them responsibly, it cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently confiscate them because they don't belong to or originate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the government. This doesn't mean that such abuses are impossible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they just take longer and require a slower rate of erosion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>We already largely have it and it is not because most people wanted it. 
<br>
Blame the victim will get us nowhere. Governments grow and abrogate
<br>
powers on their own schedule not necessarily as subject to the will of
<br>
the people as we would like to believe. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope this explains my position better.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it does.  But the way rights are abused in felony convictions,
<br>
especially bogus felonies, is the barn door standing wide open.
