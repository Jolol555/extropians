<em>&gt; shrouded in mystery (hopefully some of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astronomical friends can expound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apon this a little, it's pretty fun).
</em><br>
<p>**Speaking of which--cosmology of course is coming
<br>
apart at the seams lately. All those nice tidy
<br>
(well-accepted) theories blown to tiny bits. I love
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>**Regarding cosmogony (if anyone out there is up on
<br>
this): Is it still thought credible that Big Bang was
<br>
smaller offshoot of larger event splitting ten
<br>
dimensional universe into six and four-d unis? Just
<br>
curious.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a really dumb process; inherently lacking in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence. It's one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the great wonders of the universe that we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop from that; however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not at all implausible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A really very interesting thing to note about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection is that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works better than you would imagine. I learned this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after working on some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material from a book called &quot;genetic programming&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (can't remember the author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or anything else, it was borrowed from the library).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It turns out that, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software mimicking the process of natural selection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can evolve highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordered solutions or systems (even software) from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprisingly small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of generations. What you can do in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afternoon on a single-processor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pentium is quite astounding, and un-intuitive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the world could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created in 7 days after all; it'd probably require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P4 though.
</em><br>
<p>**Yeah; some interesting stuff going on right now. But
<br>
of course, WE intelligently PROGRAMMED the computers
<br>
to do this within parameters established by us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What do you mean by &quot;The intelligence may BE the
</em><br>
system&quot;? How?
<br>
<p>**How? I don't know how. It could all be the
<br>
collective experience of a single consciousness.
<br>
Something like Shintoism (later repackaged as The
<br>
Force).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you 
</em><br>
mean
<br>
that the physical laws of the universe somehow embody
<br>
an intelligence, 
<br>
that
<br>
there is some extra thing which guides their
<br>
(assumedly capricious)
<br>
application?
<br>
<p>**I believe (note use of word &quot;believe&quot;) that at the
<br>
very least, something consciously determined the rules
<br>
by which the game would be played, and then set it
<br>
into motion. Whether that something is still
<br>
around..(?) Why not?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;That's the same as assuming God, as far as I can see.
<br>
<p>**Hmm. You wanna call that God? Okay. God is in the
<br>
details. When people say God, I think of this big
<br>
muscular bearded guy pointing fingers and hurling
<br>
thunderbolts. That I don't buy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; **Discussion broadened, or so I thought. &quot;Angelic?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hardly. (Hey that's religion, ain't it?) There
</em><br>
remains
<br>
<em>&gt; no proof we evolved from primordial pond scum, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in turn evolved from nothing. doesn't that sound a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LITTLE unlikely..?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, we came from somewhere. A fairly mainstream
</em><br>
view is that it is
<br>
massively unlikely, in fact; however, there's a big
<br>
universe out there, 
<br>
and
<br>
a long, long time; on that scale, it becomes more
<br>
probable that 
<br>
somewhere,
<br>
somewhen, this kind of improbable event could occur.
<br>
<p>**AACCKKK!!!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The really big jump, I think, is from non-replacing
</em><br>
chemical soup to
<br>
replicators.
<br>
<p>**That first step's a dandy, all right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd like to hear some pontificating on this from
</em><br>
someone
<br>
knowledgable, if any of you are reading this.
<br>
<p>**Ditto.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After the replicators 
</em><br>
exist,
<br>
however, it all becomes a lot more stolid, marching
<br>
forward from 
<br>
generation
<br>
to generation. Now, from pond scum to us, that's
<br>
pretty unlikely, but 
<br>
so is
<br>
any state some billions (?) of years after the initial
<br>
state of any 
<br>
complex
<br>
iterative system. From pond scum to something which in
<br>
no way resembles 
<br>
it's
<br>
origins, that is incredibly probable. From pond scum
<br>
to pond scum, 
<br>
that's
<br>
unimaginable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;On the other hand, the probability does not come into
</em><br>
play. By the 
<br>
anthropic
<br>
principle, we are going to be us, intelligent life,
<br>
because what else 
<br>
can we
<br>
be? If we had never existed, that might say something
<br>
about the 
<br>
probability
<br>
of us existing. Our existence, however, does not say
<br>
anything other 
<br>
than
<br>
that we are possible. It is not possible to estimate a
<br>
probability; in 
<br>
turn,
<br>
our origin does not have to be probable. Only
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p><p>**Double AAACCKKK!!!
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This doesn't really explain anything; there is a whiff
<br>
of trolldom in 
<br>
the
<br>
air.
<br>
<p>**No; you know what it is, really? I've been spending
<br>
too much time around idiots, and then I tuned in to
<br>
this place. Perhaps I'm overcompensating.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do you mean?
</em><br>
&nbsp;More than handwaving about something greater 
<br>
than
<br>
ourselves; let us know how you really think we came
<br>
about. What's the
<br>
mechanism?
<br>
<p><p>**I don't know. And on this issue of original origin
<br>
(can there even be such a thing?) I'm not sure WHAT I
<br>
mean in its entirety--but I DO mean, as a part of it,
<br>
that This Place (Life, The Universe, and Everything)
<br>
is not happenstance. I will never believe that. Can I
<br>
prove it? Of course not--not can anyone prove it is.
<br>
<p>**How can we even go about it properly when our minds
<br>
cannot even grasp the concepts involved? For
<br>
example--when and what was the beginning? There had to
<br>
be one--yet a beginning is, quite clearly, a logical
<br>
impossibility. There had to be something before that,
<br>
and so on... Same with the extent of the universe.
<br>
<p>**We must become more than we are to find out. That is
<br>
what this is about, yes?
