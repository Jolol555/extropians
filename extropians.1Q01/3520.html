Have I flushed one out of the woodwork, as it seems?
<br>
<p>&quot;Human nature&quot; being the evolved behavioral psychology of the human
<br>
animal. Do you dispute?
<br>
<p>Communism is only non-despotic in its perfect state. Perfection is an
<br>
unstable state, which is a truism of all natural systems. It is
<br>
impossible to attain equilibria in a perfect state due to this
<br>
instability, thus communism will always be despotic, and given the
<br>
nature of power to corrupt and attract the corruptible, communist
<br>
societies will always result in tyranny. Ant colonies may be cute, but
<br>
they are heinously despotic and irrespective of the individual. Just
<br>
because communist despotism (i.e. imperfect) works for ants doesn't mean
<br>
it works for humans.
<br>
<p>Libertarianism has no perfect state, that is its nature. It is about
<br>
attaining an equilibrium between individuals that is flexible based on
<br>
the abilities, wants, and needs of each individual.
<br>
<p>As a person trained in engineering, I know that engineers and scientists
<br>
are taught to work WITH the forces of nature, not against them. You
<br>
don't build a submarine out of tinfoil, nor do you build an airplane out
<br>
of lead. You don't get a stable functioning society by making everyone
<br>
give up their entire days work to the collective, because it IS human
<br>
nature for an individual to believe they produced more than they did and
<br>
deserve more than they do, and to expect additional reward for
<br>
additional or better work. It is human nature for a person to put more
<br>
importance in the safety, security, freedom and happiness of themselves
<br>
and loved ones versus anybody else. The free market works with this
<br>
forces of human nature, communism works against them.

<em>&gt; Really, Michael, have we been reduced to red-baiting? Did we somehow slip back

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a bit confused on this. Does this mean that nothing we do matters because
</em><br>
