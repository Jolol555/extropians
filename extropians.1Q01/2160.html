Denis Bider writes, regarding the stored light pulse:
<br>
<em>&gt; Might something like this eventually be used to produce a... Hollow Man?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or an invisible aeroplane? Or an invisible building?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Photons could be absorbed at one side of the building, and the information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried over to the opposite side of the building, where the photons could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be reproduced as they were.
</em><br>
<p>An interesting speculation.  A few problems with the experiment as it
<br>
is now are, first, the photons get captured in a gas, so I think you
<br>
would have to physically move the gas to the far side of the building
<br>
and then release it.  And second, the freezing is of a discrete pulse,
<br>
so for continuous use you'd have to probably have a fast series of
<br>
pulses, storing each new &quot;block&quot; of light in a separate area of the gas.
<br>
I have no idea whether the current experiment could be adapted to deal
<br>
with these problems.
<br>
<p>In a way this sounds more like Bob Shaw's &quot;slow glass&quot; described in some
<br>
of his stories including &quot;Light of Other Days&quot;.  Slow glass is glass
<br>
which light moves through slowly.  This concept seems to resonate with
<br>
people and be remembered far more than you would think for such a simple,
<br>
even trivial, idea.
<br>
<p>Back to invisibility, I've always loved the way the effect was presented
<br>
in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, Predator.  Here Arnold plays the
<br>
leader of a band of mercenaries who, part way through their mission,
<br>
discover that they are being stalked and hunted by an alien using
<br>
super-advanced technology.
<br>
<p>This includes a camoflage suit that makes the alien nearly invisible.
<br>
It works perfectly when he's holding still, but when he moves there
<br>
is a slightly noticeable shimmer.  The implication was that the suit
<br>
took some time to react in terms of getting the emitted light to match
<br>
that which entered on the other side.  This seems like a plausible
<br>
limitation of invisibility technology as well as making the alien much
<br>
more interesting visually as we gradually learn about his presence along
<br>
with the characters he is hunting.
<br>
<p>Invisibility suits built with the technology Denis is describing might
<br>
have some similar properties.
