<p>Solar and wind power are already not more expensive than fossil fuels, 
<br>
if you happen to live way off the grid, and would have to pay for the 
<br>
connecting infrastructure all by yourself. Because fossil fuel prices 
<br>
only go up, and PV (and I guess aeolian) generators go down, the islands 
<br>
of profitability can only grow.
<br>
<p>Moreover, decentralized power generation (in extreme cases rolling your own)
<br>
does have important synergies. Reliability goes up due to redundancy (in
<br>
case a power grid island overloads, you can temporarily separate it from the 
<br>
grid, so only a small fraction of the grid blacks out), you don't have to 
<br>
transform up to high voltages (less hardware) to minimize transportation 
<br>
losses, you get cleaner power (a problem I noticed in the U.S., 
<br>
lots of spikes and glitches), can use heat (less lossage due to short average 
<br>
distances), and couple consumers and producers much more tightly (which is
<br>
a Good Thing).
<br>
<p>Makes sense, eh?
<br>
<p>Right now it should be quite profitable to use large (several 100 kW) 
<br>
high-temperature natural gas fuel cells for clusters of homes, but 
<br>
eventually, natural gas reformers and low-temperature hydrogen fuel 
<br>
cells should become available. Since they burn hydrogen, they 
<br>
interoperate with photovoltaics and water electrolysis very nicely -- 
<br>
on the long run reducing dependancy on the fossil (though rather
<br>
abundant and hydrogen-rich) fuel methane.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My power company has some plan where you can &quot;sponsor&quot; a windmill. You can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just buy power from them which has been windmill generated (and which is the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's illegal for them to sell it. They're required by law to offer only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheapest source of power.
</em><br>
<p>Amazing silliness.
