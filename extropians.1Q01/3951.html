</em><br>
<p>Given that you have no legal basis for your proposed court challenge, 
<br>
it's unethical to tie doctors up in court and force them to waste 
<br>
their money defending themselves.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Gene Leitl mentioned the multitude of people who had died without benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of suspension, and used the term medical malpractice.
</em><br>
<p>Malpractice requires a legally &quot;reasonable&quot; level of negligence. 
<br>
Cryonics currently is nothing more than fantasy.  It has a zero rate 
<br>
of return of people to the human population, and I've yet to see any 
<br>
evidence that that's going to change right over the horizon... or the 
<br>
next horizon... or the one after that.  No doctor is being 
<br>
demonstrably negligent for not suggesting cryonics to his dying 
<br>
patients.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Nitrogen was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liquified for the first time back in 1877, so theoretically, everyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has died since that time could have been suspended.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, had they solved crystallization problems back then as well?  I 
<br>
didn't think that we'd even fully done that today.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Ettinger first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;published his cryonics thesis in &quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot; back in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1962.
</em><br>
<p>So, he discovered how we can successfully even come close to 
<br>
achieving restoration from a cryonic state?  No.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   Whatever date you choose, we're talking about a lot of people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have died since, and been condemned, perhaps unnecessarily, to dust.  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology progresses and the thesis gains credence--more people 'get it',
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not just the forward thinking types--you reach a point where arguably,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ridicule and arbitrary dismissal become negligent in an of themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, if the technology progresses and the thesis gains credence 
<br>
because of the scientific evidence, then doctors who ignore that 
<br>
evidence are being negligent.  My problem with your call to sue 
<br>
doctors for negligence is that we're not even close to having 
<br>
evidence of any benefits from cryonics, so you have no case.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Ironically this is not because the facts have changed, but rather, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public perception has.
</em><br>
<p>No, you need a little thing called &quot;scientific evidence&quot;.  You're 
<br>
suggesting that doctors pursue unscientific treatments for their 
<br>
patients, or they'll be sued.
<br>
<p>By the same logic, medical professionals could be sued for not 
<br>
advising all of their dying patients that they should believe in 
<br>
Jesus Christ. If we can't base a belief upon scientific principles, 
<br>
we might as well go with a popularity contest, right?  Next to the 
<br>
number of people in this world (doctors included) who believe that 
<br>
Jesus Christ is the solution to death, cryonics adherents are nothing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;When 'ridiculous' changes to 'perhaps'.  A medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;professional has a duty to provide the best care that he can based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational judgement, not on irrational prejudices or ossified beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>The only thing that's irrational here is the claim that doctors are 
<br>
being negligent for not pursuing cryonics with their patients as a 
<br>
viable medical treatment.
<br>
<p>Would we want to see our medical professionals be constantly engaged 
<br>
in lawsuits based on wishful speculation?  I want the medical 
<br>
professionals who treat me and my family to be firmly entrenched in 
<br>
the scientific method and all that extends from it.  I don't want my 
<br>
doctor to talk to me about Jesus Christ, Vishnu, the healing power of 
<br>
magnets, acupuncture, or cryonics unless he has some scientific basis 
<br>
for doing so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So, despite the fact that, as I said, I don't think the case would be won,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I do think there is a strong ethical foundation.  And, perhaps I failed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emphasize it strongly enough, the main intent (as a practical matter) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the civil action would not be to win, but rather to put the issue intthe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public spotlight under conditions where the scientific and legal theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be elaborated with thoroughness and seriousness.  Flip dismissiveness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and smirky ridicule might be somewhat reduced in a real court with real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power and billions of real dollars (apparently, potentially) at stake.
</em><br>
<p>In other words, you'd like to use frivolous lawsuits as publicity 
<br>
stunts.  You believe that it's okay for doctors and hospitals to have 
<br>
to spend their time and money defending themselves in a court of law 
<br>
so that you can get some relatively cheap advertisement.
<br>
<p>By engaging in such activity, you are using a deficiency in our legal 
<br>
system to destroy personal assets of those in the medical profession 
<br>
- for advertising.  You have no real grounds for a case, yet you'd 
<br>
force those medical professionals into court with their well-paid 
<br>
lawyers just to maybe get a little TV time.
<br>
<p>As a related aside: Forcing others to help pay for your 
<br>
advertisements is the tactic of spammers.
<br>
<p>Why not do something legitimate, like pay for commercial advertising? 
<br>
Why not start a business selling body storage and advertise through 
<br>
infomercials?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
