<p><em>&gt;It seems Mr. Hanks definitely Gets It.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely! And yet, and yet--
<br>
<p>&lt; And yet I was able to comprehend what was going on somehow. Like the
<br>
rival ape factions fighting               over that water hole. And my God,
<br>
when that bone gets thrown up in the air and you make that
<br>
transformation into an orbiting bomb – the greatest time-cut in the history
<br>
of cinema – and the &quot;Blue               Danube&quot; started up, I mean, I was
<br>
in heaven. I felt as though the universe were expanding before my
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very eyes. &gt;
<br>
<p>The horribly sad thing is that in 2001 you need to tell people about the
<br>
existence of the damned movie. At the guest lecture I gave the other day it
<br>
was kinda discouraging, given that this was the new IT generation in the
<br>
making. A fragment of *2001* was due to shown, so at the very start, before
<br>
we speakers had been introduced but were sitting at the front, the
<br>
Zarathustra theme was played. Naturally I leaped up and seized the wireless
<br>
mike, which was long and bulbous like a thigh bone, and in slo-mo mimed
<br>
beating Mark Angeli about the head with it, before pretending to hurl it
<br>
into the air. People a year or two out of high school looked baffled. Mark
<br>
muttered from the corner of his mouth that very likely none of them would
<br>
have seen the movie... Fark. What a memory-denuded media world.
