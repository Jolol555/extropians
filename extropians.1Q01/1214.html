BUT I'm not going to
<br>
<em>&gt;think Hawking's must be true because he holds the Lucasian chair at Oxford
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(the chair does not guarantee truth or wisdom), is considered a genius
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(genius status does not ditto), and an expert in physics (expertise does not
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Is that right? *Obviously* those are not reasons for thinking that his
<br>
claims are *true*, but that isn't the point (since there are *no* reasons
<br>
for thinking *anyone's* claims are *true*--just, at best, as good as it
<br>
gets at the moment). But what, other than his hard-won reputation and the
<br>
esteem of his critical peers (emblematized in his Oxford chair), impels you
<br>
to prefer to listen to Hawking's views over those of some random claimant?
<br>
You just kinda... *intuit*... that he might have something interesting to
<br>
say (it's that sexy robot voice)? Or better yet, you just happened to
<br>
stumble over his recent papers and, without the least skerrick of
<br>
aprioristic pre-selection, you found them really convincing and morish?
<br>
(True, I hope that you would only endorse them, should you do so after
<br>
careful scrutiny, in the extent to which you *did* find them really
<br>
convincing and morish, in their own terms; but I really really doubt that's
<br>
why you read them by preference to, say, the latest aether theory on the web.)
