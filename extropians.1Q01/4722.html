<em>&gt; I'm not really certain this is 'bad'.  Any who want to study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; math/physics/engineering can easily obtain minority scholarships in such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fields, they just aren't utilized.  If the desire isn't there, why push
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them into it.  Perhaps demographics will even out economically, but for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, the blacks I know from wealthy suburban backgrounds avoid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sciences as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You're attempting to come to a conclusion based on far too few facts - you
<br>
appear to have already concluded that females and/or minorities don't have
<br>
the same mathematical faculties, and then go on to state that &quot;If the desire
<br>
isn't there, why push them into it&quot;.  However, absolutely nothing can be
<br>
concluded from the simple correlation that you mentioned above.
<br>
<p>An informal survey of a law firm where a friend of mine started work last
<br>
year showed that he was the only person (out of 30 odd) whose parents
<br>
weren't professionals.  In general, amongst the lower socio-economic groups
<br>
(whether white or otherwise), you'll find that very few children will
<br>
eventually enter into the professions (or sciences for that matter).
<br>
According to your reasoning, we should perhaps not be encouraging them into
<br>
college?
<br>
<p>As an aside, consider the following. Typically, the pure sciences and
<br>
mathematics don't pay as well as law and medicine, and tend to have a lower
<br>
status in society. Show me a well-to-do mathematician, and I'll either show
<br>
you a mathematician with wealthy familial support, or a mathematician who's
<br>
become a financial analyst.
<br>
<p>If one wants to make a career out of science, then a PhD is an absolute
<br>
prerequisite. PhD's take time - and lots of it.  And you need to be
<br>
top-notch to actually carve out a career, whereas a so-so degree in law or
<br>
medicine will still (almost) guarantee a reasonable income over ones
<br>
lifetime.  Combine these two facts, and avoiding the sciences appears, to
<br>
me, to be a perfectly rational course of action if you're concerned with
<br>
making a living.
<br>
<p>My wife has an MS in biochemistry, but will soon be graduating in law and
<br>
starting work in an IP firm.  Why? you may ask.  Answer this question, and
<br>
you'll have the answer: if you've got two equally interesting vocations that
<br>
you could move into (and both of which you enjoy), but one tends to pay
<br>
substantially more, which would you choose?
<br>
<p>Physics and mathematics are extremely interesting - but almost all my
<br>
physics and math friends are now computer programmers.
<br>
<p>As a living, physics and math just don't cut it.
