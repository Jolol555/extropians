<br>
<p>**Let's go back. In the Beginning (so to speak)--there
<br>
were ZERO genome copies of X. THere was, in fact, no
<br>
X.
<br>
<p>**So--how do we get from there, to a million genome
<br>
copies of X? 'Tis the more fundamental question. As
<br>
I've said, natural selection in obviously in
<br>
operation; I do not refute/deny/quibble with this. No
<br>
question. My problem with it is this: It needs more.
<br>
It's not enough. It is insufficient to get from the
<br>
Beginning to where we are now.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;By random
<br>
<em>&gt; chance, many are slightly and heritably altered. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great majority of offspring in a given setting is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; [contingently-]improved variants will supplant the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others? Chance, yes -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed by competitive-plus-cooperative selection.
</em><br>
<p>**Now--who/what laid down the rules? Why should this
<br>
be? How did it begin?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; You, I gather, see a Mind from outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the system intervening top-down to produce an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; echo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; of Its own order.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;**Entropy is said to be the natural condition. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suggest that Extropy requires intelligence. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `Extropy' is not a scientific concept or construct;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphor. Complex energetic organisation emerges and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrives by exporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entropy into its environment; intelligence has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing to do with this.
</em><br>
<p>**But it results in manifest intelligence, yes? Can
<br>
this result not be said to be the &quot;goal&quot; of this
<br>
process of organization?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I said nothing about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;top-down intervention by an intelligence residing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;outside the system. The intelligence may BE the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, I see. The universe brought *itself*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligently into being. Too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cool. Too self-undermining.
</em><br>
<p>**&quot;Too cool?&quot; Isn't it, though?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;**Next time you see that Darwin guy, you ask him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;me: How does your theory account for the creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the whole shebang? The starting kickoff?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your original post made no claims about the origins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the universe, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the origins of life. You recorded your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentiment that the Hamlet-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human mind was far too angelic to have come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence via brute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary processes.
</em><br>
<p>**Discussion broadened, or so I thought. &quot;Angelic?&quot;
<br>
Hardly. (Hey that's religion, ain't it?) There remains
<br>
no proof we evolved from primordial pond scum, which
<br>
in turn evolved from nothing. doesn't that sound a
<br>
LITTLE unlikely..?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I reply: actually, the evolution of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain/mind is patently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; darwinian (although some of the selected replicators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were doubtless memes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which by reciprocal feedback co-evolved with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes providing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material substrate). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for the whole shebang, that might be subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; darwinian explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in the Linde or Smolin models, which are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untestable), or it might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to a stochastic vacuum fluctuation, but either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way it is not relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the emergence by natural selection of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings 13 or so billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years later. Get a grip on the scale of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena, sir.
</em><br>
<p>**It seems I stand accused of being a mystic.
<br>
<p>A few choice bits from AE (the closest thing yet to
<br>
AI:)
<br>
<p><p>&quot;The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity
<br>
of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that
<br>
there is no room left by the side of this ordered
<br>
regularity for causes of a different nature.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The finest emotion of which we are capable is the
<br>
mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and
<br>
all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is
<br>
alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and
<br>
lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that
<br>
what is impenatrable for us really exists and
<br>
manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most
<br>
radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are
<br>
intelligible to our poor faculties - this knowledge,
<br>
this feeling ... that is the core of the true
<br>
religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense
<br>
alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of
<br>
life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the
<br>
marvelous structure of the existing world, together
<br>
with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be
<br>
it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself
<br>
in nature.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;It is in this striving after the rational unification
<br>
of the manifold that it encounters its greatest
<br>
successes, even though it is precisely this attempt
<br>
which causes it to run the greatest risk of falling a
<br>
prey to illusion. But whoever has undergone the
<br>
intense experience of successful advances made in this
<br>
domain, is moved by the profound reverence for the
<br>
rationality made manifest in existence. By way of the
<br>
understanding he achieves a far reaching emancipation
<br>
from the shackles of personal hopes and desires, and
<br>
thereby attains that humble attitude of mind toward
<br>
the grandeur of reason, incarnate in existence, and
<br>
which, in its profoundest depths, is inaccessible to
<br>
man. This attitude, however, appears to me to be
<br>
religious in the highest sense of the word. And so it
<br>
seems to me that science not only purifies the
<br>
religious imulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism
<br>
but also contibutes to a religious spiritualisation of
<br>
our understanding of life.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational
<br>
mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society
<br>
that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>**I suggest that what he refers to as
<br>
'reason/rationality made manifest in existence,'
<br>
etc.--is what I'm talking about.
<br>
<p>**Love ya, Albert.
