The article had a lot of worrisome statistics, but it lacked any evidence
<br>
for what it claimed was its main point, which is that things are getting
<br>
worse.  They'd have to show that back in the 40s or 70s or whenever,
<br>
people were able to do these things better than they can today.
<br>
<p>We know from the Flynn effect that people are getting better at abstract
<br>
reasoning.  It's possible that this is coming at the expense of concrete
<br>
skills and factual learning.  But I can't help wondering whether the
<br>
average 40s GI just off the farm could &quot;orally interpret distinctions
<br>
between types of employee benefits.&quot;
<br>
<p>You also have to look at social changes.  Society is much more inclusive
<br>
these days.  Prior to the civil rights movement you had a large underclass
<br>
which wasn't able to even try to participate in the mainstream of the
<br>
economy.  Today there is a much greater effort to allow everyone to
<br>
take part.  This by itself will mean that you are seeing people who have
<br>
had a more limited background.
<br>
<p>A better measure would be to look at an inclusive institution such as
<br>
the military.  How have literacy rates changed for inductees over the
<br>
past decades?  They test all their incoming people, and these figures
<br>
should be available.  This would give a more objective measure of trends.
