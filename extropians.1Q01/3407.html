The systems you describe, if implemented with no overrides, are going 
<br>
to get pilots killed. No question whatsoever.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can already see limited cases in which humans have at
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The F18 has experimental ACFIT software (anti-controlled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flight into terrain).  If the pilot is heading for the ground, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ACFIT assumes he is dead, injured, or crazy, takes over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the controls and avoids the turf.  Then if the pilot doesnt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start giving commands that make sense, the ACFIT will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually ignore him and fly home.  The future JSF (Joint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Strike Fighter) will have extensive ACFIT as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software that will take over the controls when the plane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been fired upon, in order to decide upon an optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy then attempt an evasive maneuver to avoid an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incoming missile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the time it would take to train a Martian colonist, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we could write the software to take many of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tasks that require high intelligence out of her hands.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has some enormous advantages.  If we manage to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the genetic switch that would allow us to produce a tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, good chance is that she might be mentally average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or below.  But she could carry frozen embryos that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost sure to be way above average.  If the machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can carry the load in the area of judgement for one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation, then intelligence could be bootstrapped upwards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a sense then, the Mars colonists would be kinda sorta
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living post singularity (lower case s).
