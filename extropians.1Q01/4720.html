<p>I think this is a matter of perspective. The metaphor of a spike struck me
<br>
(as apparently it had struck some other people previously) when I sketched
<br>
several technological curves starting and remaining fairly flat thousands
<br>
of years ago and beginning their extraordinary bound upward only a few
<br>
hundred years back, or even a few decades ago. On that scale, what we
<br>
experience here and now as a powerful swell *is* a dramatic spike.
<br>
<p>It's true that in Vernor Vinge's fictional anticipation in MAROONED IN
<br>
REALTIME, the exponential rate of technical advance self-bootstraps at such
<br>
a dizzying rate that at last, within days, hours or perhaps seconds, AI and
<br>
group-mind potentiated change seems literally to have caused the
<br>
intelligences of the solar system to transcend into some other order of
<br>
being. At any rate, they vanish overnight, leaving only their enigmatic
<br>
detritus behind like an abandoned snake skin. 
<br>
<p>Is that the sort of shape a Singularity must have? I think Eliezer believes
<br>
so. I'm agnostic on the matter, because I don't know what time lags will be
<br>
imposed by the balkiness of the world in instantiating such repeated
<br>
upgrades and even paradigm dislocations. I'm *hoping* that the Spike, as I
<br>
blurrily perceive it, *will* look and feel from the inside as a powerful
<br>
swell we can surf. But even if our repeatedly augmented abilities make that
<br>
feasible, the swell will probably graph as a spike (IMHO) on any diagram
<br>
with a larger historical horizon than a century.
