<p>Subject: E.13.1 Why doesn't the Moon rotate?
<br>
Author: Laz Marhenke &lt;<a href="mailto:laz@leland.Stanford.EDU?Subject=Re:%20Fish%20in%20Space&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101081518.QAA21999@galileo.mpi-hd.mpg.de&gt;">laz@leland.Stanford.EDU</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>In fact the Moon *does* rotate: It rotates exactly once for every
<br>
orbit it makes about the Earth.  The fact that the Moon is rotating
<br>
may seem counterintuitive: If it's always facing towards us, how can
<br>
it be rotating at all?  To see how this works, put two coins on a
<br>
table, a large one to represent the Earth, and a small one to
<br>
represent the Moon.  Choose a particular place on the edge of the
<br>
&quot;Moon&quot; as a reference point.  Now, move the Moon around the Earth in a
<br>
circle, but be careful to always keep the spot you picked pointed at
<br>
the Earth (this is analogous to the Moon always keeping the same face
<br>
pointed at the Earth).  You should notice that as you do this, you
<br>
have to slowly rotate the Moon as it circles the Earth.  By the time
<br>
the Moon coin goes once around the Earth coin, you should have had to
<br>
rotate the Moon exactly once.
<br>
<p>This exact equality between the Moon's rotation period and orbital
<br>
period is sometimes seen as a fantastic coincidence, but, in fact,
<br>
there is a physical process which slowly changes the rotation period
<br>
until it matches the orbital period.  See the next entry.

<p>Subject: E.13.2 Why does the Moon always show the same face to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth?
<br>
Author: Laz Marhenke &lt;<a href="mailto:laz@leland.Stanford.EDU?Subject=Re:%20Fish%20in%20Space&In-Reply-To=&lt;200101081518.QAA21999@galileo.mpi-hd.mpg.de&gt;">laz@leland.Stanford.EDU</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>When it first formed, the Moon probably did not always show the same
<br>
face to the Earth.  However, the Earth's gravity distorts the Moon,
<br>
producing tides in it just as the Moon produces tides in the Earth.
<br>
As the Moon rotated, the slight elongation of its tidal bulge was
<br>
dragged a bit in the direction of its rotation, providing the Earth
<br>
with a &quot;handle&quot; to slow down the Moon's rotation.  More specifically,
<br>
the tidal bulge near the Earth is attracted to the Earth more strongly
<br>
than the bulge away from the Earth.  Unless the bulge points toward
<br>
the Earth, a torque is produced on the Moon.
<br>
<p>If we imagine looking down on the Earth-Moon system from the north
<br>
pole, here's what we'd see with the Moon rotating at the same rate as
<br>
it goes around the Earth:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth                                         Moon
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__          
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/  \                                        ____           ^
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;|    |                                      /    \          |
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tidal bulge *greatly*
<br>

<br>
<p><p>What if the Moon were rotating faster?  Then the picture would look like:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth                                         Moon
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counterclockwise;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tidal bulge *greatly*
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exaggerated.
<br>
<p>If it isn't clear why the tidal bulge should move the way the picture
<br>
shows, think about it this way: Take the Moon in the top picture, with
<br>
its tidal bulges lined up with the Earth.  Now, grab it and rotate it
<br>
counterclockwise 90 degrees.  Its tidal bulge is now lined up the
<br>
&quot;wrong&quot; way.  The Moon will eventually return to a shape with tidal
<br>
bulges lined up with the Earth, but it won't happen instantly; it will
<br>
take some time.  If, instead of rotating the Moon 90 degrees, you did
<br>
something less drastic, like rotating it one degree, the tidal bulge
<br>
would still be slightly misaligned, and it would still take some time
<br>
to return to its proper place.  If the Moon is rotating faster than
<br>
once per orbit, it's like a constant series of such little
<br>
adjustments.  The tidal bulge is perpetually trying to regain its
<br>
correct position, but the Moon keeps rotating and pushing it a bit out
<br>
of the way.
<br>
<p>Returning to the second picture above, the Earth's gravitational
<br>
forces on the Moon look like this:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F1    &lt;-----/   )
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F2 &lt;-------(___/
<br>
<p>F2 is larger than F1, because that part of the Moon (the &quot;bottom&quot; half
<br>
in the drawing, or the half that's &quot;rearward&quot; in the orbit) is a bit
<br>
closer to the Earth.  As a result, the two forces together tend to
<br>
twist the Moon clockwise, slowing its spin.  Over time, the result is
<br>
that the Moon ends up with one face always facing, or &quot;locked,&quot; to the
<br>
Earth.  If you drew this picture for the first case, (where the Moon
<br>
rotates at the same rate that it orbits, and the tidal bulges are in
<br>
line with the Earth), the forces would be acting along the same line,
<br>
and wouldn't produce any twist.
<br>
<p>Another way to explain this is to say that the Moon's energy of
<br>
rotation is dissipated by internal friction as the Moon spins and its
<br>
tidal bulge doesn't, but I think the detailed force analysis above
<br>
makes things a little clearer.
<br>
<p>This same effect occurs elsewhere in the solar system as well.  The
<br>
vast majority of satellites whose rotation rates have been measured
<br>
are tidally locked (the jargon for having the same rotation and
<br>
orbital periods).  The few exceptions are satellites whose orbits are
<br>
very distant from their primaries, so that the tidal forces on them
<br>
are very small. (There could be, in principle, other exceptions among
<br>
some of the close-in satellites whose rotation rates haven't been
<br>
measured, but this is unlikely as tidal forces grow stronger the
<br>
closer to the planet the satellite is.)
<br>
<p>Pluto's satellite Charon is so massive (compared to Pluto) that it has
<br>
locked Pluto, as well as Pluto locking Charon.  This will happen to
<br>
the Earth eventually too, assuming we survive the late stages of the
<br>
Sun's evolution intact.  :')
