</em><br>

better
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Right, Barbara, which is one problem with the nature of discussion about 
<br>
issues that greens and other anti-progressives have co-opted in the public 
<br>
discourse: They have become subjects of &quot;activism&quot;, which is inherently 
<br>
polemical and adversarial.  By no later than 1980 or so, people who saw 
<br>
questions of human interaction with the natural environment as inherently 
<br>
political had begun to shape the cultural milieu in which they were discussed 
<br>
in terms of &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;anti&quot;.  
<br>
<p>It would be GREAT if we could unwind this polemical dialectic, and I'm wide 
<br>
open to suggestions of how to do it.  I think you're right that always 
<br>
looking hard at FACTS, is a way to do this, but it's equally important to 
<br>
work the rhetoric &quot;downward&quot; to first principles and moral assumptions.  This 
<br>
is one reason that I've become increasingly interested in the more &quot;radical&quot; 
<br>
elements of the green movement, because they have been willing to follow 
<br>
their thinking to first principles.  And those principles - when unmasked for 
<br>
what they really are - can be seen to be &quot;anti-humane&quot; and thoroughly 
<br>
inconsistent with many values held dear by a wide spectrum of people. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I would add that most people don't know how to think logically--we've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  recently discussed this in the thread having to do with education. If 
</em><br>
anyone
<br>
<em>&gt;  missed that, I'd suggest especially reading what Samantha had to say about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the difference between IQ and thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I wish I could be hopeful on this point, but I do not see any increase in 
<br>
rationality or critical thinking in our society at large or in the media 
<br>
streams that influence it.  Rather, I see the on-going process of translation 
<br>
of ideas and values into ideology, which in turn spawns simple cultural 
<br>
icons, sloganeering and manipulative polemics.
<br>
<p>As is usually the case, I look back to history as a guide to how things might 
<br>
develop in the future and how we might better communicate our ideas and 
<br>
values.  Thinking back to the time since the Renaissance, I see three major 
<br>
ideological or cultural conflicts that have taken place in the West.  These 
<br>
are (1) the religious conflict following the Reformation, (2) the conflicts 
<br>
between pre-modern political systems on the one hand and the democratic and 
<br>
republican political ideas spawned and cultivated in the Enlightenment on the 
<br>
other, and (3) the conflict between communitarian and 
<br>
capitalistic/individualistic political and economic systems.  In each of 
<br>
these, there have been periods and regions of intense polarization, 
<br>
characterized by violence and repression, and there have also been times and 
<br>
places where the tension between two ultimately inconsistent world-views or 
<br>
value and idea systems managed to coexist in relative peace, while still 
<br>
fueling struggle for ultimate cultural primacy.
<br>
<p>The conflict between the green/luddite cultural movement and the ideals and 
<br>
values of technological progressives promises to be the Next Big Divide in 
<br>
the West, not least because the influential thinkers driving the ideological 
<br>
formulations of the former tend to cast the issues in terms of conflict and 
<br>
absolutes, just as those who drove the previous cultural divides did.  In 
<br>
16th and 17th Century Europe, there was no middle ground between Papism and 
<br>
Protestantism: The nature of the issues involved forced every individual, 
<br>
social institution and political entity to &quot;choose sides&quot;.  Although there 
<br>
were certainly many bloody examples of similar pressure to extremism in the 
<br>
other two &quot;great divides&quot; identified above, there were also many examples of 
<br>
relatively peaceful transitions and multiple pathways of adoption and 
<br>
adaptation among individuals, institutions and whole societies, as well as 
<br>
whole areas of human experience that weren't forced into identification with 
<br>
one side or the other of the ideological dialectic.  One of my partners who 
<br>
used to be a political science professor calls instances of the latter 
<br>
examples of &quot;cross-cutting cleavages&quot;, i.e. situations in which people and 
<br>
institutions have interests on both or multiple sides of a number of issues.
<br>
<p>So far, it looks like the luddite/progress divide will also be one of 
<br>
cross-cutting cleavages within particular societies, and one in which some 
<br>
societies tend more toward one extreme or the other.  Right now, the clearest 
<br>
examples of this latter tendency toward &quot;partial polarization&quot; is the 
<br>
developing distinction between Europe and the US.  The process bears close 
<br>
scrutiny and analysis, to see if the kind of mixed interests that most 
<br>
individuals and institutions have will keep the conflict between the two 
<br>
ideologies from further polarization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Greg says:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;... you have a deck that is stacked decidedly against rational development
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; science and technology policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  BUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;...as the history of the last 250 years in the West has proven,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; technological business enterprises produce tangible results in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; efficient manner that many people want and will pay for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think this is the answer. Most people WANT the benefits of technology:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  lights, heating, power tools and appliances, cars, abundant food, medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  care, youthful bodies, and so forth.
</em><br>
<p>Which is the primary reason that the more radical formulations of the 
<br>
anti-technology and anti-science crowd have found such a small audience so 
<br>
far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Most people can't think for themselves, but they can usually follow a line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of reasoning if it's set forth step by step. And the anti-tech people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  been doing this for years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In order to make a rational counter argument, one must acknowledge that 
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt;  of what the anti-tech people say is true. Not to do so makes you look like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you're either stupid or a liar. Quality of life HAS deteriorated because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  air and water pollution and the paving over of vast amounts of land. Whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  species ARE dying off. Agriculture IS being practiced in a way that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  destroyed and continues to destroy top soil at an alarming rate--you can 
</em><br>
see
<br>
<em>&gt;  this for yourself simply by going out into a cultivated field and picking 
</em><br>
up
<br>
<em>&gt;  the cement-like clods almost entirely devoid of organic matter--and you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not thinking things through if you counter that by saying that hydroponics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or nanotechnology will solve the problem. Along with loss of biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  diversity, there HAS been great loss of cultural diversity and great loss 
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt;  economic diversity as well. The global economy HAS killed off small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  manufacturing businesses by the thousands. These particular things the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;luddites&quot; say are TRUE.
</em><br>
<p>There is truth in all these things - but I suggest that one reason for the 
<br>
kind of polarization I describe in historical terms above is the tendency of 
<br>
the greens to speak of these things as &quot;true&quot; in some absolute, 
<br>
decontextualized sense.  Increases in the total level of some pollutants on a 
<br>
global scale is not discussed in light of the significant decreases in 
<br>
pollution that have been implemented with recent technological innovations.  
<br>
Current climate change isn't discussed in connection with the equally 
<br>
well-established fact that there have been wide swings in climate during 
<br>
recorded history, and much greater ones in the recent biological past of our 
<br>
species and its immediate progenitors.  Likewise with episodes of species 
<br>
extinction.
<br>
<p>I am not suggesting that the counterbalancing facts I mention above somehow 
<br>
serve as some kind of complete moral absolution for current trends in 
<br>
technological development.  However, it is true that if one looks at the 
<br>
rhetoric of green and luddite ideologues, one sees an almost complete absence 
<br>
of weighing of costs and benefits.  The light is shown entirely on the cost 
<br>
side of the ledger.  The irony is that the greens and luddites feel they are 
<br>
justified in such polemics because, in their view, the &quot;benefit&quot; side of the 
<br>
equation gets far too much attention in Western societies.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  What is NOT true is that technology per se is to blame for the current 
</em><br>
state
<br>
<em>&gt;  of the world. The way to counter the argument that technology is bad is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  show people that there are ways of having the good without such a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  amount of bad. One of the best ways to do this is through stories where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can show people concrete examples of how different social systems work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Again you come up against the separation of the sciences and the arts. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mainstream movies and novels I've come across lately seem to dwell on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  dangers of technology. Popular song lyrics are mostly pessimistic.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  This is the front of cultural phenomena that concerns me more than 
<br>
any other.  The dystopian, negative view of science and technology has 
<br>
somehow become the accepted foundation of just about every &quot;mainstream&quot; 
<br>
consideration of these things.  For instance, at this point it seems 
<br>
inconceivable that someone would fund the production of a major Hollywood 
<br>
movie in which science or technology was portrayed in a positive light, much 
<br>
less as a tool to be affirmatively grasped to solve human problems.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;...a Carl Sagan seems to come along all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; too rarely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  OTOH, long as you're still alive, it's never too late to start learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  communications skills.
</em><br>
<p>Amen, sister!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; The simple facts are that the kinds of people who are drawn into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; and technical fields tend to be TERRIBLE communicators in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; have an impact on the culture at large.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I wonder why this is. Wish we could talk about this on the list and figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it out. It hasn't always been so.
</em><br>
<p>I think it's one of the most important mandates of Extropy Institute to 
<br>
explore that question and develop tools to counter the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Even getting the people who could afford to fund the grooming of good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; spokespeople to recognize the need seems to be an uphill task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This is something the people on this list could begin to remedy 
</em><br>
immediately.
<br>
<em>&gt;  Beginning with each person funding their own grooming (funding in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  time as well as money).
</em><br>
<p>Again, amen, and I hope to write more about that this weekend.
