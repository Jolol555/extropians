<em>&gt; OK, so you are talking about ideals over pragmatism/reality. Fair enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think you'd ever see this, though. Business is not the olympics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair play, it's not how you win, it's how you play the game, all that good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff. Hell, the olympics is hardly the olympics by those standards. Nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What works technologically is not a playing field, or even business.  It
<br>
is a matter of engineering and science ultimately.  Inferior solutions
<br>
extract a price even if they are popular and making money.  We all 'win'
<br>
based on how close to the best technology we end up having to live and
<br>
work within.  The fates of different companies are not the most
<br>
important criteria. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Business is a lot more like natural selection. It's not an environment where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair play is going to help you stay alive. It's dirty, and desperate. Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those big monopolies, who crush all in their path, are one step, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental shift, one mis-direction, from becoming corporate worm food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Business, is not a natural given.  It is in the context of particular
<br>
economic, political and technlogical realities.  As those change what
<br>
works for the business changes and it becomes more or less connected to
<br>
the real welfare of all the people concerned with it directly and
<br>
indirectly.  It need not be a cut-throat jungle and quite often, even
<br>
today, is not.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Particularly, pure competition never, ever makes good sense. If you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flog a product in an environment of multiple competitors, each striving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solely on his/her merits, and the winner takes all (pretty much par for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course), what chance is it that the winner will be you? Less than 50%? Say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the money invested is your own. Does that make any sense at all, as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business model?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The winner seldom takes all in a natural market.   If they do they can
<br>
only keep that hold by continuing to offer the very best product.  Other
<br>
tactics will not work for very long.  I think you have some strange
<br>
ideas about business.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But no one gets into the fighting pit and dukes it out, in a good clean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight, may the best man win, tally ho, what! What a damned mad idea. Well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually some try to, by building a better product and relying on it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merits. Some of the best ideas have died that way.
</em><br>
<p>It is not such a zero-sum game.  Some of the best ideas are being given
<br>
away and are dominating.  Isn't that wild?
