From: &quot;Jim Fehlinger&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:fehlinger@home.com?Subject=Re:%20more%20on%20Brand%20and%20the%20Singularity%20idea&In-Reply-To=&lt;003101c07fd7$f8f313f0$052e9fd4@xanadu&gt;">fehlinger@home.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, effects that some folks on this list can contemplate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equanimity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are events that would horrify many people outside of extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sci-fi/technophilic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circles.  For example, Eliezer Yudkowsky has said on many occasions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as long as the human race survives long enough to give birth to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of superintelligence, the ultimate fate of humanity is of no consequence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to him or, presumably, in the ultimate scheme of things).  I suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitude is part of what gives folks like Bill Joy the willies.
</em><br>
<p>Please be more careful when quoting people. I'm sure the context of the word
<br>
'humanity' indicated 'human-ness'. I really don't think Eliezer means he
<br>
doesn't care about the people living now, far from it.
<br>
<p>Personally, I'd rather have a better substrate, and one which I can
<br>
customize too. This ridiculous bag of mostly-water I pilot is a real drag. I
<br>
won't even mention the twisted cognitive machinery I was given. This primate
<br>
model is due for a complete redesign. Humanity ha! you can keep it!
<br>
<p>On the point of it scaring the willies out of people, I think it's already a
<br>
lost cause to try &amp; get everyone up to speed. The fact is; the world is
<br>
changing faster than society. This will only become more pronounced as the
<br>
curve steepens. At some point there will be a destabilization of the old
<br>
ways. &lt;sigh&gt; That's gonna takes some fancy footwork or we're all screwed. I
<br>
have zero faith in 'humanity' to figure it out alone without bloodshed. Just
<br>
read the news.
<br>
<p>Dale Johnstone.
