<p>&lt;&lt; I know that you are jumping on his anti-PC views. That was not what I 
<br>
liked 
<br>
&nbsp;about his speech. I liked that he was standing up for some unpopular value 
<br>
in the face of opposition, lies, and slander. He could have skipped any 
<br>
comments about what is politically correct and simply addressed the 
<br>
specifics. I can understand why you see an inconsistency, and possibly it's 
<br>
real, though that's not as clear to me. But that's not what I resonated with 
<br>
in his speech. 'm sure Chuck is no extropian, and I was probably being 
<br>
politically incorrect on this list to post that speech. But darn it, I still 
<br>
like it. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Max,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess your last two sentences reflect what I responded to  in Heston's 
<br>
speech.  In an group dedicated to progress must we apologise for considering 
<br>
all viewpoints?  Am I to be constrained by the PC movement any more than I am 
<br>
by the radical right
<br>
