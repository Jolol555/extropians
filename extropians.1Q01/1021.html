<p><p>&quot;When will overpopulation create worldwide starvation?&quot; 
<br>
<p>They cordoned off the area and brought in disposal experts to defuse the 
<br>
bomb, but it turned out to be full of â€” sawdust. The Population Bomb is truly 
<br>
a dud, although this news and its implications have yet fully to sink into 
<br>
the general consciousness. 
<br>
<p>Ideas can become so embedded in our outlook that they are hard to shake by 
<br>
rational argument. As a Peace Corps Volunteer working in rural India in the 
<br>
1960s, I vividly remember being faced with multiple uncertainties about what 
<br>
might work for the modernization of India. There was only one thing I and my 
<br>
fellow development workers could all agree on: India unquestionably would 
<br>
experience mass famine by the 1980s at the latest. For us at the time this 
<br>
notion was an eschatological inevitability and an article of faith. 
<br>
<p>For 35 years since those days, India has grown in population by over a 
<br>
million souls a month, never failing to feed itself or earn enough to buy the 
<br>
food it needs (sporadic famine conditions in isolated areas, which still 
<br>
happen in India, are always a matter of communications and distribution 
<br>
breakdown). 
<br>
<p>Like so many of the doomsayers of the twentieth century, we left crucial 
<br>
factors out of our glib calculations. First, we failed to appreciate that 
<br>
people in developing countries will behave exactly like people in the rest of 
<br>
the world: as they improve their standard of living, they have fewer 
<br>
children. In India, the rate of population increase began to turn around in 
<br>
the 1970s, and it has declined since. More importantly, we underestimated the 
<br>
capacity of human intelligence to adapt changing situations. 
<br>
<p>Broadly speaking, instead of a world population of 25 or 30 billion, which 
<br>
some prophets of the 1960s were predicting, it now looks as though the peak 
<br>
of world population growth might be reached within 25 to 40 years at a 
<br>
maximum of 8.5 billion (just 2.5 billion above the present world population). 
<br>
Even without advances in food technology, the areas of land currently out of 
<br>
agricultural production in the United States and elsewhere will prevent 
<br>
starvation. But genetic technologies will increase the quantities and 
<br>
healthfulness of food, while at the same time making food production much 
<br>
more environmentally friendly. For example, combining gene modification with 
<br>
herbicides will make it possible to produce crops that induce no soil 
<br>
erosion. New varieties will requires less intensive application of nitrogen 
<br>
fertilizers and pesticides. If genetic techniques can control endemic pests, 
<br>
vast areas of Africa could be brought into productive cultivation. 
<br>
<p>There will be no way to add 2.5 billion people to the planet without 
<br>
environmental costs. Some present difficulties, such as limited supplies of 
<br>
fresh water in Third World localities, will only get worse. But these 
<br>
problems will not be insoluble. Moreover, there is not the slightest chance 
<br>
that population growth will in itself cause famine. What will be fascinating 
<br>
to watch, for those who live long enough to witness it, will be how the world 
<br>
copes with an aging, declining population, once the high-point has been 
<br>
reached. 
<br>
<p>The steady evaporation of the question, &quot;When will overpopulation create 
<br>
worldwide starvation?&quot;, has left a gaping hole in the mental universe of the 
<br>
doomsayers. They have been quick to fill it with anxieties about global 
<br>
warming, cellphones, the ozone hole, and Macdonaldization. There appears to 
<br>
be a hard-wired human propensity to invent threats where they cannot clearly 
<br>
be discovered. Historically, this has been applied to foreign ethnic groups 
<br>
or odd individuals in a small-scale society (the old woman whose witchcraft 
<br>
must have caused village children to die). Today's anxieties focus on broader 
<br>
threats to mankind, where activism can mix fashionable politics with dubious 
<br>
science. In this respect alone, the human race is not about to run out of 
<br>
problems. Fortunately, it also shows no sign of running out of solutions.
