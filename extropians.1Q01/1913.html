<em>&gt; &gt; It is not all that bad. We will still have the option of privacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within certain confined spaces (like our own houses). Only in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; public places you will always be likely to be monitored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nanobot defence systems can be used to do surveillance inside our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; houses, but not to inspect and record our occupations, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in stead, to find and destroy possible intruding monitoring bots.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I found it interesting when &quot;nanodot.org&quot; first came up it's subtitle was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Automated Storytelling Homepage.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When nanotechnology and quantum computing arrive (if they have not
</em><br>
already),
<br>
<em>&gt; the superintelligent form of communication with society may not be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;English language&quot;.  Rather, it would likely be &quot;Body Language.&quot;  Rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than machine superintelligence &quot;talking to us&quot;, it seems more likely that
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; would begin &quot;talking through us&quot;, using methods of storytelling and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puppeteering that find us in perhaps strange coincidences with each other
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; living out educational vignettes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;right brain&quot; language of play-acting and theater seems a more likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of advanced communication than &quot;left brain&quot; linear symbol sequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What better syntax than total orchestration?  There was a recent movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120789">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120789</a>) in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characters lived in a black and white world.  Outsiders infiltrated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world and color began arriving as citizens began thinking &quot;outside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; script.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder if first contact with superior alien intelligence might take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of suddenly feeling oneself as a character in a sitcom, surrounded by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caricatures of social archtypes.  If I were an extropian gray alien from
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; year 2110 popping back in time to communicate with my human ancestors, I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably just take control of the situation and do puppet shows in order
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; allow the creatures to become enlightened through experience rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making some limited attempt to communicate in a linear fashion through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spoken language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I were Feynman or Von Neuman and orchestrating a peaceful &quot;Coup
</em><br>
d''etat&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; (oxymoron, I know), I'd probably fashion it as a mass automated script
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orchestrated over a whole generation, giving each individual plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deniability, so the obvious conclusion would be that something on a scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestive of an &quot;act of god&quot; had occurred which left all with the tacit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consensus that the old play was over and a new play had begun.
