<p>Are you a republican or a libertarian? This seems like an awfully partisan
<br>
position if the latter. I prefer to think that both sides were corrupt, but
<br>
in different ways. It's one of the reasons I almost always vote third party
<br>
when I can find a candidate I like. As for Bush winning dishonestly, it's
<br>
pretty obvious to anyone willing to look at the evidence clearly that his
<br>
&quot;victory&quot; was a manufactured coup, but then, I wouldn't want Gore either
<br>
(for different reasons). I could provided links if you're interested.
<br>
<p>As for those ballots, my brother lives in Palm Beach County and is one of
<br>
the people whose ballot was thrown out. He is an intelligent, capable
<br>
person who has been voting in the same location for many years. He told me
<br>
that he noticed a problem with the ballot right away, but when he tried to
<br>
get another one, was told by one of the workers &quot;too bad.&quot; This is probably
<br>
just some poor schlub of a volunteer being lazy, but is symptomatic of a
<br>
much larger problem.
<br>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, we don't have a president.
