<em>&gt; &gt;But punishment looks a lot like revenge.  If it is not a deterrent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and does not rehabilitate what and who is it for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The victim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Segregating them from the population is a different beast than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;punishment, deterrence or rehabilitation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay lets make an example here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two malcontents break into my apartment and make off with a bunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my stuff, and ignore my thousands of books except maybe to throw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them around the room as punishment for not being able to get into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my gun safe. Unlike most times, these two get caught, tried, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's now time for......what exactly?
</em><br>
<p>Tetting your stuff back with reasonable wear and tear. Counseling and
<br>
rehab for the perpetrators as first choice frome there.  Punishment if
<br>
that seems effective for these particular people.  It os not effective
<br>
for all people.  Incarceration would do nothing unless it was the only
<br>
form of punishment permissiable.  If you are going to punish I think
<br>
something like a public flogging would make more sense as punishment
<br>
than simply locking someone up in what amounts to criminal training
<br>
school.  Unless of course the perp happens to really like flogging.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, first I want my stuff back. Then I want compensation for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hastle I've got to go through getting my life in order. Then I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want something done so these two don't pull anything like this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Done too or done about.  Is the goal to lessen the likelihood they will
<br>
repeat such behavior or to punish to satisfy your anger or some such?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, whats going to really happen? Almost nothing, I'm not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see anything resembling compensation so we can forget that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  I could see a wiser system putting these two to work for a
<br>
period of time doing something you wanted done.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's likely that for a little while these two are going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deprived of what little joy they have in life, which pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to amount to stealing other peoples stuff. They don't get to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hang out, they don't get to sit home and watch T.V. or do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else they like to do for awhile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually you don't actually know these two yet so it is a bit premature
<br>
to assume what is or is not important in their live or what brings them
<br>
to stealing.  There are all sorts of reasons different thieves steal.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So yeah, for awhile I want them someplace they don't want to be,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing stuff they don't want to do, eating stuff they don't like,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hoping they get the idea that they did wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So you want vengeance.  Understandable, but does it actually do the most
<br>
good?
