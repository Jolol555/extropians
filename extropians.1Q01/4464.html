<p>I understand the point you're making. See below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What do you think &quot;Political Correctness&quot; is except

</em><br>
<p>These are not equivalent, though they certainly overlap. For one thing, 
<br>
there is a big difference between moral suasion and public approbation. The 
<br>
latter is essential to PCness, but the former can exist without the latter. 
<br>
You may be right that Heston himself was doing both, though I didn't see it 
<br>
that way given the audience he was talking to. The Harvard audience was not 
<br>
likely for the most part to be sympathetic to him. So he did not seem to me 
<br>
to be appealing to the emotional power of the majority. He was instead 
<br>
appealing directly to moral suasion. (You may have a better case in the 
<br>
Time Warner shareholder meeting.)
<br>
<p>PCness works by systematically cutting off alternative views by ridiculing 
<br>
them and suppressing them. I have had the experience many times while at 
<br>
university, especially at Oxford. I don't remember Heston ridiculing 
<br>
alternative views. Was he suppressing them by his actions as a shareholder? 
<br>
In one sense, yes, but not in a systematic way. He was making his voice 
<br>
heard and giving others the evidence to make their own decision.
<br>
<p>There is no sharp distinction here, as standing up for your values actively 
<br>
can shade over into suppression if enough people agree with you, and 
<br>
stating an unpopular view shades into PCness if your view becomes more 
<br>
widely accepted. I cut Heston some slack because he was NOT in the majority 
<br>
in that situation at Harvard.
<br>
<p>I know that you are jumping on his anti-PC views. That was not what I liked 
<br>
about his speech. I liked that he was standing up for some unpopular values 
<br>
in the face of opposition, lies, and slander. He could have skipped any 
<br>
comments about what is politically correct and simply addressed the 
<br>
specifics. I can understand why you see an inconsistency, and possibly it's 
<br>
real, though that's not as clear to me. But that's not what I resonated 
<br>
with in his speech.
<br>
<p>'m sure Chuck is no extropian, and I was probably being politically 
<br>
incorrect on this list to post that speech. But darn it, I still like it.
