</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  I want to see warfare converted into a situation where there
<br>
are *no* pink bods in danger.  The battlefield will be a huge expensive
<br>
version of the comedy channel's Battlebots, or perhaps that scene in
<br>
Star Wars with an army of droids.  During the transition period, an
<br>
army of pink meat could face an army of droids, but they would recognize
<br>
the futility of facing a mechanical enemy that has no fear, no remorse, no
<br>
mother at home, etc.
<br>
<p>Then the alphas in the less developed nations would spend enoooormous
<br>
sums to build their own droid army.  Then the alphas of those nations
<br>
would be faaaar more reluctant to use and risk their expensive droid army.
<br>
{Before it was mere human lives at stake, of which the alpha had plenty.}
<br>
Then we have a transition period where the droids become ever more
<br>
sophisiticated and ever more expensive, somewhat like the development
<br>
of fighter aircraft in the last century.  Resulting in great profit to those
<br>
<p>corporations that design and build the robosoldiers, of course.  Pretty
<br>
soon every nation has a collection of stunningly expensive hardware,
<br>
and war becomes economically disasterous for both sides, and eventually
<br>
no more bodily fluids are shed on the field of battle, neither blood nor
<br>
motor oil.  This is my vision of the future of warfare.  spike
