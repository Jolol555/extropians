<em>&gt; This is the crux of the problem. The intentions may be

<em>&gt; If the thing is truly a sentient being, it will be

</em><br>
<p>Hence the phrase &quot;seed AI&quot;.  But don't say &quot;evolution&quot;; &quot;evolution&quot; is a
<br>
word with extremely specific connotations.  Say &quot;capable of recursive
<br>
self-improvement&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since, as you say,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly--or evolve into something very, very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UnFriendly.
</em><br>
<p>Again - not &quot;evolve&quot;.  Whatever modification it chooses to make to itself,
<br>
it will make that choice as a Friendly AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In which case, there may not be a damned
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're playing dice.
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm choosing the path of least risk in a world where risk cannot be
<br>
eliminated.  You seem to be thinking in terms of &quot;see risk - don't take
<br>
risk&quot;.  A popular viewpoint.  It could very easily get us all killed.
