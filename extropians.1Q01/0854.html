 ('binary' encoding is not supported, stored as-is)
My wife recently announced that she is going to have a baby,
<br>
and that, along with the fact that we are a mere ten days into
<br>
the new millennium has me thinking about the future a great
<br>
deal.
<br>
<p>I was wondering what the readership of this list thought would
<br>
be the state of the world, particularly, technological advances
<br>
of significance to extropians, over the next few decades.
<br>
<p>For fun, let me specifically ask what important developments in
<br>
extropian related technology will take place by significant
<br>
milestones in this new child's life:
<br>
<p>by 2006 when it starts school
<br>
by 2014 when it becomes a teenager
<br>
by 2019 when it goes to college
<br>
by 2035 when it becomes the same age as I am currently.
<br>
<p>(Of course, it hardly need be said that all such comments are
<br>
entirely speculative, however, I suspect that this group will
<br>
at least have educated speculation.)
