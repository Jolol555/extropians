</em><br>
<p>Heck, they're surviving a MS OS. How can a VB app bomb any often than that.
<br>
And I'd like to interview a) the system admin b) the software maintainer
<br>
I'm not taking just your word for it. (Heck, you've sold out to the Dark

Side of the Force ;)

<em>&gt; I am currently involved in an application at Honeywell which uses multiple

</em><br>
<em>&gt; horrible, it must be a big mistake!  Nope, works just fine.  Does the job.
</em><br>
<p>Many things can do the job. If we're remaining within cost-effectiveness
<br>
and deadlines, is this the best thing that does the job?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Let's see... Fortune 500 company Becton and Dickinson trusted me to write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several very important business components for  their SAP deployment - in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Visual Basic.  Status?  Works just fine.
</em><br>
<p>If it's running on a Redmond OS, I'm sure it crashes less often than
<br>
the server has to be rebooted.
<br>

<em>&gt; Intel, *gasp* uses Microsoft technolgies.  Intel, Samantha, is a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company.  And they use Microsoft technologies, including Visual Basic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Active Server Pages.
</em><br>
<p>Er, have you somehow missed the term &quot;Wintel&quot;? It is rather telling.
<br>
Intel is the Microsoft of semiconductors. 'nuff said. Never, ever a single
<br>
decent product they themselves have developed. Same flavour of business
<br>
practices. Luckily, IBM left the evil triumvirate long ago, and Intel seems
<br>
to make movements in that direction.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; It makes me wonder, if Visual Basic is such a &quot;weak&quot; tool, why so many huge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succesful companies bank on it...
</em><br>
<p>Technical excellence is not a necessary part of a successful business.
<br>
Business acumen is.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't want to take anything away from the legions of Java and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unix/Linux/WhateverElse programmers out there.  They do work just as good as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us VB guys.  :)
</em><br>
<p>If OpenSource stuff is any good, and draws the best people, it should give 
<br>
the companies using them fitness advantages. Granting, there are vogues, as 
<br>
there are management vogues, but I think we cannot yet tell whether the 
<br>
advantage of OpenSource is real and sufficient to make a difference in the 
<br>
Real World (i.e. is sufficient to kill off a number of propritary warez 
<br>
peddlers).
<br>
<p>Apart from that, shouldn't we quit the rabid advocacy? It's off-topic, and
<br>
makes one look rather foolish, as it makes a bad kind of pattern.
