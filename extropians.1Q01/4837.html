<p>Unless we educate them properly they will continue in their old ways even as posthuman energy beings.  I can just see them drunkenly over-embibing on plank energy as they play cosmic soccer with a passing comet.  And I don't even want to imagine the damage to the solar system when they all riot over the game results!  So, Max and the rest of ExI have a grave responsiblity to nip this sort of thing in the bud before it happens!  : )
<br>
<p>Max teaching the class of gifted young people was well worth the time and effort.  An intimate gathering like that could actually bear fruit in ways a mass media interview might not.  It comes down to touching one life at a time.  Who knows what seeds have been planted and what may come of it later on.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
