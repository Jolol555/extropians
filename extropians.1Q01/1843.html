<em>&gt; 1. It appears that a non-offensive type of self-defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devise is  desireable.  Some type of armor perhaps?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or perhaps just non-lethal....the classic SF &quot;stunner&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>To fantasize a little bit... A personal armor, one that could be used on a
<br>
regular basis, would be wonderful. Imagine something that would protect the
<br>
wearer against anything from bullets to biohazards.
<br>
<p>It would probably turn out that such an &quot;armor&quot; is at this point unfeasible
<br>
as an armor, but could perhaps be implemented as a system - a system of
<br>
'secure' buildings, hallways, streets, with secured entry and exit points
<br>
and all sorts of detectors. This is probably workable, although expensive.
<br>
Given the current probabilities of dying from a bullet in any given year
<br>
(1:~40000 US, 1:~100000 Europe), not many people would probably be
<br>
interested enough to warrant building such a system.
<br>
<p>One day, in a thousand years, we might find that the only way to live
<br>
properly is to enclose oneself in a robotic outfit some 3 meters tall and 3
<br>
meters in diameter, with the robot's external sensors attached directly to
<br>
one's spinal cord. No need to move the body - move the robot. Thus, you are
<br>
protected against virtually anything modulo an atomic bomb.
<br>
<p>Don't see it happening anytime soon, though...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2. It also appears that there is a significant interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in PREVENTING the average person from having any means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self defense.  Similar, as it were, of predators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dislikeing the concept of their prey having such a mechanism?
</em><br>
<p>I think you're stretching it a bit. Speaking for myself, I would be very
<br>
interested in ENABLING the average person to any kind of self-defense that
<br>
is not likely to be used for aggressive purposes. But firearms aren't a
<br>
defense mechanism, they're an attack weapon.
<br>
<p>No conspiracy theory here, at least not as far as I'm concerned.
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
<p>denis
