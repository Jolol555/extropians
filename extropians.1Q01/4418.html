<p>
One of the problems that I have had off and on with the extropian
<br>
philosophy is that it cannot say (unlike religous beliefs) --
<br>
&quot;This is what you should believe.....&quot;.  There may be some
<br>
very loose principles to which most extropians would subscribe
<br>
but it is difficult to manifest those &quot;beliefs&quot; into &quot;action&quot;
<br>
(perhaps in part because from a management perspective it seems
<br>
unextropian to say to extropians -- &quot;You should do this&quot;!).
<br>
<p>I want to draw extropians attention to a recent case where
<br>
&quot;political correctness&quot; resulted in the censorship of an
<br>
individual.
<br>
<p>See:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Science Fair's Teachable Moment&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedailycamera.com/news/talbott/20lclin.html">http://www.thedailycamera.com/news/talbott/20lclin.html</a>
<br>
and the Slashdot discussion at:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/02/20/199228">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/02/20/199228</a>
<br>
<p>Now, from my perspective, censorship of &quot;scientific&quot; results
<br>
(by the powers that be) can only be &quot;unextropic&quot; by definition.
<br>
The correct response would seem to be a justified, reasoned
<br>
articulated expression of why such scientific explorations
<br>
should be presented for public observation. 
<br>
<p>I believe that it would be highly useful for situations like
<br>
this to come under the focus of a national or international
<br>
&quot;rapid&quot; response team.  One can only imagine the consternation
<br>
of local school board officials, principals, teachers, etc.
<br>
when the start receiving telephone calls from various
<br>
extropians (in the U.S., Europe, etc.) asking them what they
<br>
could possibly have been thinking to &quot;censure&quot; a scientific
<br>
study.)
<br>
<p>Now, while on the one hand these people tend to &quot;answer&quot;
<br>
to local voters, on the other hand anyone can make a long
<br>
distance or international phone call.  One can balance the
<br>
default requirement to answer to the local voters with the
<br>
&quot;realization&quot; that if one adopts an information suppression
<br>
position, one *will* hear from others that view that position
<br>
as &quot;distasteful&quot;.  It only requires several examples of
<br>
politicians in Colorado, Singapore, Hong Kong, Moscow, etc.
<br>
&quot;receiving&quot; or &quot;refusing to accept&quot; documented telephone
<br>
conversations to &quot;shift&quot; the debate into an open forum.
<br>
<p>Particularly useful would be &quot;strategic&quot; assaults --
<br>
i.e. someone from Europe or Asia calling at a time
<br>
very inconvenient to them, but &quot;convienent&quot; to the
<br>
recipient of the phone call.  Making it clear that
<br>
there is an inconvenience and expense involved, but one
<br>
that is acceptable to express ones opinions.  This
<br>
in effect &quot;requires&quot; the recipient to listen to ones
<br>
arguments.
<br>
<p>What would be the &quot;logistics&quot; of a rapid response team?
<br>
(a) to identify cases that a majority of extropians
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have an interest in expressing an opinion.
<br>
(b) to make available the contact information (email/phone)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the individuals involved in the issue.
<br>
(c) to report to the group/sub-group regarding any conversations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or responses by the parties inolved in the issue.
<br>
<p>So, I offer this example and a suggested response strategy
<br>
as a means for dealing with &quot;political action&quot; on the
<br>
extropian front lines.
