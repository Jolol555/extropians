<p><p><em>&gt;Even if those songs are commercially profitable, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shouldn't be produced because some people find them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;offensive?  And that would make the record companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that did produce such songs unethical?
</em><br>
<p>I would think they should be produced, and once I own a record company, it 
<br>
will matter what records I think should be produced. Your general tone here 
<br>
suggests that you feel that this is our decision to make as a society. A 
<br>
record company and a songwriter are individual entities, interacting 
<br>
voluntarily, and unless otherwise stipulated by a contract, either party can 
<br>
withdraw.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By that standard, record companies probably shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produce anything except innocuous bubble gum love
</em><br>
<em>&gt;songs, 'cause someone is gonna be offended no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what.
</em><br>
<p>There are some that do, I imagine. This leaves an untapped market and an 
<br>
opportunity for others to move in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How about this, what about the family of a slain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; police officer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suing Ice-T for instigating the killing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sounds like anti black PC speak rather than pro black
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PC speak.
</em><br>
<p>I'm missing the race reference that you're referring to here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He isn't really pro liberty... else he'd take the bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the good.  He just wants to draw the restrictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in different places than they are currently drawn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And he acts out his desires in real life.  That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you can post an example, but off the top of my head, after reading the 
<br>
speech once, I can't think of a place where he (Heston) said anything where 
<br>
he advocated restricting anyone's liberty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Am I the only one on this list that sees things this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way?
</em><br>
<p>no

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Gates is supposed to walk through the airport with an armful of pies
