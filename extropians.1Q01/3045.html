I believe the Japanese do have plans to construct underground cities, 
<br>
owing to shortage of aboveground real estate. Given seismic activity, 
<br>
not the best place for it.

<p><em>&gt; Here is an idea that I have been toying with recently.  We have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; space-based frontiers.  These might serve as practice areas where we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can demonstrate viable space technologies in a safer environment. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People could visit or study these environments to see what works and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what doesn't.  We can then adapt these technologies to space.  Those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that already live in these environments will already be experienced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonists in hostile environments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, bases on the Moon, Mars or the Asteroids might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underground to escape from radiation.  Could we build an underground 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; city?  I'm thinking about deep underground, at least thousands of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feet and maybe much more.  We would have to learn to tunnel from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside the base, shore up as we go, keep air-tight (or water-tight) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we go.  We would need to maintain temperature balance and oxygen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels.  We could try to use biosphere-type balancing to keep up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels.  We would have to develop remote telecommuting for jobs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside the base, or develop our own means of business from within 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the base.  We would have to learn to grow plants without natural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sunlight.  We would have to adapt to living underground without going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topside.  This would develop and demonstrate many requirements for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underground space bases, but would be close enough to earth for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visiters to see and to evacuate in case of emergency.  Maybe the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology developed there could be patented or somehow sold to help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fund and advance space colonization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many of the Gas Giants planets have oceans within their moons.  Could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we create an undersea base in the middle of some ocean?  We would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to adapt to the cold and dark.  We would need to adapt to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure and build structures for that environment.  These would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to resist corrosion from constant water contact.  We would need to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have regular access to the outside environment.  We would try to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out how to grow plants in the cold, dark water.  We would need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wetsuits that were heated, and would need to carry our own oxygen. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We would want to learn to extract oxygen from the water, and safely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use hydrogen fuel.  We would need to figure out a means of waste 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disposal that didn't contaminate the water around the base.  We even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to explore and contend with new types of marine life not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen topside.  (Scientist estimate that most deep-sea marine life has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not been observed.)  We would have to learn to anchor our bases to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wet and possibly unstable surfaces.  We would need to develop water 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; craft for transportation, and develop tools and building materials 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that work underwater.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think these two ideas merit further attention.  I predict that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underground or undersea colonies would occur before colonizing other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds.  I also think that the technologies developed in these two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments would be a precursor to space colonies.  These colonists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be seen as the forerunners of space colonists.  They may even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invent the technologies required for space colonization, and may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide the largest number of space emigrants.  Any exports developed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from these frontiers would be much easier to ship topside for profit. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We could develop more efficient and more profitable exports later for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcoming the long-distance shipping to earth that space colonies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would encounter.
