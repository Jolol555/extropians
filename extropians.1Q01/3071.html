You know I can't tell if you're serious?
<br>
I really can't.
<br>
Not at all.

<br>
out an order of magnitude on how much it takes to soft-land stuff 
<br>
on Mars, or the moon for that matter. For instance the Vikings were 
<br>
launched by a Titan III with a Centaur upper stage. The mass of the 
<br>
lander was 576 kg. Cost of the mission in current bucks, about 
<br>
3 billion. 
<br>
Nowthen, all the propulsion/guidance tech needed to do a Mars 
<br>
mission today is already developed. However, if you take the 
<br>
time to review the sizes of the past Mars landers, you will see 
<br>
why we need to go to absurd lengths to reduce the weight of 
<br>
the payload. A typical stock buyer would perhaps drop 100 
<br>
bucks for a share, eh? Well, fine, that constitutes *one gram* of 
<br>
food. Dinner will run well over a thousand dollars per bite. Shall 
<br>
we not search far and wide for the minimal biter? This minimal 
<br>
approach is all about practicality, John. 
<br>
ct suggested removal of redundant organs. Well, why not? But 
<br>
not intestines, those need to be fully functional and extracting 
<br>
every calorie, especially considering those calories cost 30 bucks 
<br>
apiece. And that is an optimistic estimate. Keep those in there. 
<br>
All of these problems will be solvable if someone would just 
<br>
kindly provide us with a person 30 cm tall and weighing 5 kg, 
<br>
with an appetite to match. The rest of the miniaturization we 

can do. spike
