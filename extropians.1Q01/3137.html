Yah. Interesting points. 'Tis why so many disasters are now caught on 
<br>
tape; as the stuff gets cheaper there's more of it out there and it's 
<br>
more likely someone nearby will have a cam.
<br>
<p>Re: Rodney King: Here's the thing. The law never caught up with the 
<br>
tech; very often, while it IS illegal to record audio, it is NOT 
<br>
illegal to record video. Go figure.
<br>
<p>Interesting cop case in Sacramento: Guy gets hi-beams in mirror, 
<br>
flips the guy behind him the finger. The guy behind him turns out to 
<br>
be a cop, who pulls him over, puts a gun to his head, threatens to 
<br>
kill him, etc.
<br>
<p>Never happened, says the cop. He never resisted; no reason to draw.
<br>
<p>Thing is, he pulled the guy over in front of a nighttime security 
<br>
camera. Oops.
<br>
<p>New story: I don't remember that.
<br>
<p>Yah. The cop actually did time. Immediately after this incident, CA 
<br>
DA's got the ball rolling to ensure that such &quot;surprise evidence&quot; 
<br>
couldn't embarrass the prosecution in the future. Instead, it must be 
<br>
revealed early on.

<p>Heh. Col. Jeff Cooper has noted that &quot;An armed society is a polite 
<br>
society.&quot; Perhaps that will be true of a &quot;wired&quot; society as well!

&gt; [re impact of citizen recording of police behavior]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, you know, I hate to wax realistic on you--but at the moment, 
&gt; &gt;  this is not bogus; this is reality--and cyborgish humans are bogus. 
&gt; &gt;  Reality has its drawbacks.
&gt; 
&gt; Ahh, but reality has a way of catching up with &quot;bogus&quot; ideas.  First, recall 
&gt; Rodney King.  Second, note that the camera I bought to plug into my computer 
&gt; recently (that I mentioned in another post a moment ago) cost less than $50 
&gt; retail and is packaged in a plastic housing smaller than 4 cubic inches, most 
&gt; of which is empty space.  Third, note that video and audio data compression 
&gt; technology continues to progress at an astonishing rate.  Fourth, note that 
&gt; the price of digital storage technology continues to drop precipitously.  
&gt; Fifth, the price of the technology for detecting a device's position (i.e. 
&gt; GPS) is also falling continuously.  Finally, note that the intersection of 
&gt; PDA and cell phone technology proceeds apace.
&gt; 
&gt; Put all these things together and you have at least the distinct possibility 
&gt; that a significant number of &quot;normal&quot; people will at some point be carrying 
&gt; audio-video recording devices that automagically note and record the time and 
&gt; place of a specific recorded event.  Although I by no means agree with all of 
&gt; the moral conclusions he draws from observing these same facts and 
&gt; possibilities, David Brin has made a strong case that the reality of a 
&gt; populous equipped for ubiquitous audio-video recording will have a 
&gt; significant impact on the legal system and society at large.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think it's a big leap to project that by 2010 (2020 at the very 
&gt; latest) an &quot;always-on&quot; audio-video PDA will be a CHEAP and universal item of 
&gt; personal equipment.  Yes, it's a bigger leap from there to an implant.  But 
&gt; even the &quot;mature&quot; external PDA will have significant impact.  For instance, I 
&gt; can easily imagine that at a certain point a practical presumption will be 
&gt; raised that a person has a right to keep her PDA with her and on throughout 
&gt; any encounter with the police.  Such a common-sense presumption would lead to 
&gt; effects on the relationship of citizens to the police as great or greater 
&gt; than Miranda and its progeny.
