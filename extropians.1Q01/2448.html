<p>Err. As stated, I don't agree with this position. (But you knew that
<br>
already, didn't you? ;-)
<br>
<p>Reasons why I disagree: (pace Richard Dawkins) evolution of the human
<br>
genome stopped around the time we began to express the capability to 
<br>
inherit and pass on acquired behavioural traits. Raw evolutionary
<br>
selection pressure doesn't work the same way on a species that posesses
<br>
language. We're generalists, distinguished from other species by our
<br>
astonishing plasticity of behaviour: as witness the conditions we live
<br>
under today, compared to those our ancestors evolved under.
<br>
<p>(In my case: sitting in front of a computer, in a dwelling in a sub-
<br>
arctic city, doing brain-work -- as compared to being a plains-based
<br>
tribal scavenger in sub-Saharan Africa. If I had to behave in accordance
<br>
with my evolutionary heritage in order to be happy, I ought to be very
<br>
UN-happy right now. But I'm not.)
<br>
<p>Moreover, I find the idea that we should follow an 'optimum' set of rules
<br>
because we evolved that way morally abhorrent. You do realise that this 
<br>
is the root of the argument deployed by various bigots for banning/killing 
<br>
homosexuals?  &quot;It isn't natural ...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is NOT totalitarian, this is an open ended, liberatarian, systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based approach.
</em><br>
<p>It's warmed-over biological determinism. I can't comment on whether it's 
<br>
libertarian or not, but it strikes me as being utterly un-extropian.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, to a european, I am sure being told to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their hands off controlling other people seems like fascism, just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'freedom of religion' means the freedom to persecute other religions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some fundamentalists.
</em><br>
<p>You're descending into ad-hominem abuse, not to mention gross
<br>
over-generalisations based on nationalist stereotyping of a negative
<br>
variety. Can you rise above it for once, so we can have a civil
<br>
discussion?
