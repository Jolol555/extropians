<p><em>&gt; One of the nasty little conspiracies alluded to in this article:

<em>&gt; More than 20 years after Sony et al. won the Betamax case in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court, the MPAA (Motion Picture Association
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of America) seems bound and determined to prevent consumer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taping of digital TV (and don't forget, that's not just HDTV, it will be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Have you tried shopping around for a cheap DVD recorder?  or Recordable
<br>
Media?
<br>
<p>Not talking about the little DVDRAM unit Creative Labs makes.  That just
<br>
doesn't have the capacity.
<br>
<p>I've been ripping DVDs using CladDVD 1.64.  The decrypted movie files take
<br>
up so much space I had to buy an 80Gig hard drive for $300.  It's just not
<br>
worth it.  Given that each movie takes up about 8 gigs, that's $30/movie
<br>
just to put it on a little jukebox in the garage.  Screw that.  It's cheaper
<br>
just to buy the stupid DVD's.  But I don't.
<br>
<p>Now, puting a movie on 10 or 12 cd-recordables is just a pain in the ass.
<br>
<p>So, how about a nice 18Gig recordable with 75 cent blank disks.  That would
<br>
solve my problems for a short term.
<br>
<p>A lot of moving parts, though.
<br>
<p>A little Keele Memory systems terabyte per square centimeter &quot;solid state&quot;
<br>
credit card ram would really help.
<br>
<p>I think they can manufacture it for about $30 per credit card sized memory
<br>
card.
<br>
<p>So how many movies is that sitting in your wallet?
