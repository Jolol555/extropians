<em>&gt; What's the difference between this system and being in a small town,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the local police officers know who the typical &quot;trouble makers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are?
</em><br>
<p>The difference is that in a small town people KNOW each other. They pass
<br>
each other on the street and say hi several times a week. They risk their
<br>
lives together when there's an emergency such as a flood or major fire. And
<br>
so forth. There's a HUGE difference between being arrested by someone to
<br>
whom you're just a generic criminal and being arrested by someone whose kid
<br>
you took to the hospital the time he fell from a tree and broke his arm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the difference between this system and having a large team of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police officers, who have thoroughly studied hundreds of photos of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felons and wanted criminals, watching near the gate?
</em><br>
<p>Not much difference here. And not much difference from situations where
<br>
people are encouraged (or frightened) into spying on their neighbors and
<br>
reporting them to the cops. But there's something wrong with all those
<br>
pictures. A society that needs that sort of observation of its members in
<br>
order to enforce its rules must have some structural flaws.
