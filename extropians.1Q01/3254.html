<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But today, in the US, once you are under arrest, police powers to search

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think it is perhaps not that bad.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The police have not that many rights beyond what any other citizien has.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you are not reading carefully. I said &quot;once you are under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrest&quot;. Arrest is not detainment, and it's not conversation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Rights&quot;? It's more proper to speak of police _powers_.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You are absolutely correct to say that the police privileges and duties are not
<br>
rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that an individual policeman has the same rights as I have. Im
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the jurisdictions I keep tabs on, however, their powers to arrest are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly stronger. And, once one is arrested, they can legitimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search one's person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly what that means might vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I do know that they don't need a warrant to put everything one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with one into a bag _once one is under arrest_. That comes with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; booking, usually.
</em><br>
<p>I think as long as we don't commit any crimes, we don't have so much to concern
<br>
us.
<br>
<p>The issue then is &quot;what is crime?&quot;.  There is violent crime, and that is pretty
<br>
obviously crime.  There are property crimes, which are mostly also civil acts
<br>
of theft or property damage, for example grand theft auto, which is a felony
<br>
property crime, vs. graffiti, which is a misdemeanor property crime. There are
<br>
a lot of information and business crimes.  A crime is a breaking of the literal
<br>
law.  Thus, there is lack of qualification. For example, a criminal thalidomide
<br>
dump might cost much more costs in terms of monetary and human terms compared
<br>
to a guy who runs a red light when no other cars are around.  Driving involves
<br>
a responsibility to the safety of others, so there are laws about maintaining
<br>
and operating a vehicle, including that in most states there is required
<br>
automobile insurance.
<br>
<p>We have more access to accurate satellite imagery data, it can show us much
<br>
about the surface environment, but not anything under a roof.
<br>
<p>About the PDA, you can program the PDA so that you press a button and it
<br>
becomes inert.
