<p>I'm writing to agree with you rather than to correct you, and to add a 
<br>
couple of comments about deception and what constitutes art. One reason I 
<br>
liked the pop art of the 1960's was that it seemed to so effectively 
<br>
capture the essence of the period, particularly with the images of 
<br>
commercial products such as Coke and Campbell's soup. In addition to pop 
<br>
art, there are the original products which (one might say) inspired the pop 
<br>
art, and the advertisements which glorified the products.
<br>
<p>IMO, future historians will look to advertisements as the most expressive 
<br>
of the visual arts of the latter half of the 20th century. Many people 
<br>
consider advertising to be nothing more than a form of mass deception. To 
<br>
the contrary, I believe advertising is one of the most accurate reflections 
<br>
of the spirit of the times. My doctoral dissertation (not completed...yet) 
<br>
was on the psychological aspects of decision making, and it was in the 
<br>
marketing journals that I consistently found the most sophisticated 
<br>
research on what makes people decide and act as they do. A good marketing 
<br>
strategist seeks to know human nature and work with it, rather than 
<br>
fighting it and trying to re-shape it.
<br>
<p>A personal note on the subject of advertising as art--one of my favorite 
<br>
works of art of all time is a television ad that ran many years ago. I 
<br>
believe it was advertising perfume--possibly Chanel. The ad is stored in my 
<br>
memory in black and white--whether the actual ad was b&amp;w or color I can't 
<br>
be sure. It showed a woman diving into a rectangular pool and gliding under 
<br>
water. As she glided, the shadow of an airplane passed over her body. Does 
<br>
anyone else remember this ad?
