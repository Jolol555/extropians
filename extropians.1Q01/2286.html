</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proprietary language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At some point, this attitude gives diminishing returns.  I have a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preference for standards based implementation, but only when it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diminish the results in some way.  Oracle is nearly as ubiquitous in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; database world as Windows is in the desktop world, so I don't feel bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about writing some code in PL/SQL when called for, any more than I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel bad about writing part of a Windows app in VB if that was best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suited for the job.  Considering the shear numbers of people who know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PL/SQL, and the probability that it will be supported for many years into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future, I don't see a problem with it from the perspective of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business manager.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, I could do everything outside of the database using JDBC/ODBC and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the language of your choice (and many times I do), but I wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily do it out of principle.  My client is paying for the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution to their needs, not for a solution that meets an abstract ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can't be easily justified, particularly when a standardized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution barely meets the required metrics (speed and scalability are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typically my given primary design goals).  Beside which, many &quot;standards&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have fallen by the wayside faster than proprietary systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have to design for scalability and headroom, and so that is where I put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the engineering elegance.  I am not religious about language, as long as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is reasonably clean.  A well-written code base in any reasonable language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes the choice of language really a matter of aesthetics or cosmetics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In practice, I usually do most everything in open standard environments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but for sections of a system with critical performance, I am not shy about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diving in and creating a custom tailored solution using proprietary tools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In PL/SQL land, that may mean that certain complicated transactions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compiled into the database and accessed using standard APIs in something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Java.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oracle should be a vendor of relational dbms technology not busy locking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you in to having persistent solutions that work only on Oracle and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useless on anything else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While lowest common denominator solutions may be wonderful for a broad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class of applications, some require tighter integration than you'll find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a standards based environment.  Business types don't care; Oracle is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a de-facto standard to them, unless they have a religious objection.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oracle isn't an excellent tool for the job, I won't use it or recommend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  Fortunately, it is quite adequate as an enterprise database and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually the preferred database for many managers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have made a quite comfortable living writing OO persistence middleware
<br>
to alleviate having to depend on an particular flavor or vendor of
<br>
database.  Business types certainly do care when they need to support
<br>
various types of database solution over time on heterogeneous
<br>
platforms.  Many real-world business people do not want to be married to
<br>
Oracle or any other single vendor.  More than a few of them have tried
<br>
to make that relationship work for them and have decided to try
<br>
something different.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One could argue that a standard database 4GL could be designed, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would defeat the purpose.  4GLs such as PL/SQL reflect the internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details of the database and abstracting it would defeat most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages of a 4GL to begin with, since internals vary quite a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between major vendors.  But there is still a good argument for 4GLs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since there is a substantial amount of opimization inherent in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design.  Frequently I use JDBC/ODBC for database access instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; native methods, but I do so knowing full well that it won't hold a candle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to native methods performance-wise; when performance is critical, I go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; native every time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>PL/SQL is not a 4GL.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the business world, Oracle is a de-facto standard, just like Microsoft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My clients don't want me to sacrifice the business solution on an arguable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical premise.  &quot;Standard&quot; means different things to people from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the business world and the software engineering world.
</em><br>
<p>De-facto standards are meant to be toppled and should be as soon as they
<br>
get lazy.  The argument from the other side is quite strong.  Standard
<br>
solutions in a world that re-invents itself every other Monday are not
<br>
enough.
