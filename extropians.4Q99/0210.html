A good point.  You can worry about fertilizer as well.

<p>
We probably can't.  All we can do is try to control the distribution
of uranium/plutonium and the technology to refine these materials
as best we can until we can put radioactivity detectors on everything
coming into the country that can carry a bomb.  While we can't
stop the drugs, we have fairly effectively controlled plane
hijackings (with some loss in ease of travel).

<p>
In the meantime, it would appear the best we can do is try to identify those
individuals crazy enough to try to smuggle in a bomb and issue preemptive
strikes (while risking the wrath of other nations).

<i>&gt; no treatment and none is likely anytime soon.</i><br>

<p>
I would have to disagree.  GENBANK shows that there are gene sequences
for proteins from various strains of Ebola, especially the nucleocapsid
protein and the complete genome for the Mayinga strain (added 2/28/99).

<p>
Given these things it is relatively easy to develop vaccines for Ebola.
If you lookup Ebola &amp; vaccine in PubMed you get back 22 articles including
efforts by the Army to engineer vaccines, antibodies that can neutralize
the virus and DNA vaccines that protect mice from a lethal challenge.

<p>
I would have to say you personally are probably at greater risk from
Staphylococcus of the flesh eating variety, E Coli:H312 or drug-resistant
tuberculosis (which was in the news tonight) than you are from Ebola.

<p>
Well, it isn't as easy as you might think, first you have to have
the required labs &amp; containment facilities, then you have to have
people trained to do the work, then you have to produce quantities
of the virus and test it (any volunteers!?!), etc.  For something
as deadly as Ebola you would be lucky to get the carrier into
the country before he died.  Then you have the same problem
you have with the rocket.  You can back track this work to its
source.  What labs have P4 containment facilities, what foreigners
were trained in these methods, who are the viral experts in countries
that could fund this type of effort, etc.

Re: The Hot Zone quote...

<p>
You should consider befriending a emergency room room physician or nurse.
I'm sure they can tell you stories that make that quote mild by comparison.
I believe we have TV programs (as sick entertainment) now routinely showing
people setting themselves on fire, falling off of 4th-5th story rescue
ladders, being shot at by disgruntled postal workers, being crushed by
run-a-way freighters, etc.

<p>
Death (or severe injury) often doesn't come with a pretty ribbon wrapped
around it.
