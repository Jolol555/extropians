For those of you who are engineering buffs, if you haven't picked
up "Scientific American presents Extreme Engineering" it is well
worth the read.  Covers lots of stuff -- dams, skyscrapers, scramjets,
Win2K, denovo genomes, and of course what must be one of the most excellent
examples of "eating crow", nanotech in "Some Assembly Required".
(For those of you who don't know Scientific American dissed nanotech
a few years back.)  They have a great picture of a molecule constructed
from 18 cesium and 18 iodine atoms by Donald M. Eigler at IBM Almaden
in San Jose (interesting that they are starting with the bigger atoms first,
compared to the Cornell group).

     So, tell me, are you feeling worried???

<p>
Sigh, unfortunately nothing on MBrains, I guess I'll just have to wait
for the rest of the world to catch up...
