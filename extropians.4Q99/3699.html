<a name="3705qlink1">Sounds kind of cool, to think that some living material has been going

was maybe brought along by astronauts, just lately?</a>

<p>
The only reason that I can think of as to why this hasn't been talked
about more is that people apparently can't avoid thinking about the
future as a kind of repeat of certain kinds of frontiering that have
happened in the past. In the past, it would have been impractical, to
say the least, for explorers from Europe to avoid bringing their
bacteria along to the New World! Now, though, if we have a relatively
"sterile" option for exploring Mars via robot, at least until we've got
a life assay of many surface sample locations, maybe that's the route we
ought to follow?<a name="3705qlink3"> To risk sending humans very soon still sounds to me
sort of like sending whole "boatloads" of potential bio-contaminants,
possibly to the point of confusing some important life search results.</a>

<p>
Mention of how people think of the future in terms of the past reminds
me again of the seeming silliness of some of the scenarios in Kim
Stanley Robinson's Mars books. I already mentioned the fact that
Robinson's Mars settlers, some of them, anyway, were looking forward to
exporting mass amounts of Mars metals to Earth -- IIRC, this was the
main mention in the series of what one should be looking for in
interplanetary commerce in the future. In this story line, corporate
conglomerates were supposed to build a "Mars stalk" transport system
primarily to enable this kind of material commerce. Surely though, the
molecular construction needed for the "stalk" would also imply that the
Earth people aren't that interested in mass metal shipping anymore! Fact
is, transport of metals down railway lines was a big deal in our *past*,
for developing commerce in the western parts of North America, for
instance.

<p>
What I'm saying is, the future is apt to be *different* from the past in
terms of how the economy is likely to develop, and also, perhaps, in
terms of what's best for the integrity of key science findings, too.
