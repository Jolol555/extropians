I do not see how you would get this opportunity.  When we had the Foresight
gathering last spring, one of the subgroups I joined studied how we could keep
runaway AI from happening.  Several AI researchers were in this subgroup.  On of
the participants was working on an AI based language translation system for a
very large European technology company.  The system is going to be supplying
simultaneous voice language translation for telephone calls.  He told us that
the system had a huge amount of real world working 'knowledge' so that it could
'understand' what someone was talking about.  We realized that if a system of
this kind got sufficiently intelligent, it could start influencing the actions
of the people that it was serving by slight shading of the meanings in the
translations.  The people might never know what hit them.

the Internet, it could arrange to make traffic patterns look like the net needed
more routers.  This one we *could* see coming because pretty soon the majority
of our GNP would be going to building routers.</a>

In the end we concluded that either it was not possible to stop, or that it
would take greater minds than ours to do it.  I am in the business of helping
people see beyond what they think is impossible, but I must admit, it beats me.
