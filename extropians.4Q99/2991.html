<p>
That, or else the *mechanism* for producing homosexuals is not the traditionally

<p>
understood recessive gene mechanism [like that which produces blue eyes, etc]
but  rather an entirely different mechanism, such as:  there exists a
possibility
<br>
of inheriting the *genital configuration* genetic material from one parent
while inheriting the *sexual preference* genetic material from the other.  In
this way, two hetero parents could produce homo offspring, or vice versa.

<p>
Also with this mechanism, we can explain ambiguously gendered offspring
produced from two non-ambiguously gendered parents.  I dont want to
speculate too much on this as I am not trained in this field.  spike
