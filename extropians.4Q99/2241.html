Hi, Billy; how ya'll Textropians doin'?
<br>
Sorry, I have been out of touch for so  long, but I have been taking some 
serious Computer Science courses this semester, and often it's all I can do 
to remember to do all the necessary things, etc., and so I often forget to 
do all the other things, such as update my new email addresses. I decided to 
use the new free Net accesses (Altavista, netZero), and so my new email addy 
is randysmith101@hotmail.com.

<p>
Now, as you may remember, I spent some time in the Navy aboard a nuke sub, 
and yes, I can assure you, they DO stink! They do have air "conditioning", 
such as it is, but it does not for the most part regulate temperature, 
except in certain electronics spaces. Instead, it "scrubs" the air, removing 
CO2, CO, etc, and replenishing the O2.

<p>
The air in a sub underway, and even in port, with the hatch open, is a most 
foul, repellent and tenacious stench, an unsavory combination of the myriad 
petroleum derivatives used for lubrication products, and years worth of the 
odor of the various bodily secretions from the unwashed sailors encased 
within, which build up an odious film upon the interior wall of the sub.

<p>
I'll never forget it...

<p>
<a href="2230.html#2241qlink2">&gt;  My point was simply that *comfort* is not a priority (except</a><br>
<i>&gt;maybe in the flag bridge...).  The goal is to keep the temperature between</i><br>
<i>&gt;(roughly) 55F and 90F, not to maintain a 70F office-building environment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Yep, but more like 45 to 110. In one location, you may nearly freeze, and in 
another, sweat profusely.
