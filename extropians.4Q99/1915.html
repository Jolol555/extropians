<a href="1909.html#1915qlink1">&gt;     &gt;I think you're objecting to the fact that "sin" lacks a clear definition,</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No, that's not the problem, nearly all the really important things in life</i><br>
<i>&gt; have no clear definition. My objection is that the idea is pointless.</i><br>

Gentlemen: Here are assembled the descriptions of "Sin" presented by
<pre>
                those religious sects who use this term in their scriptures:

</pre>
<p>
-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-

<p>
UNIFICATION CHURCH

<p>
Adam and Eve...were tempted by the archangel Lucifer into illicit
and forbidden love. Through this, Adam and Eve willfully turned
away from God's will and purpose for them, thus bringing
themselves and the human race into spiritual death (DUTA).

<p>
UNITY

<p>
Sin, sickness, poverty, old age, and death are not real, and they
have no power over me. There is nothing in all the universe for
me to fear (LT, p. 35).

<p>
THE WAY INTERNATIONAL

<p>
Man fell because of disobedience to God's Word (JC, p. 66).

<p>
ORTHODOX HINDUISM

<p>
By the Law of Karma--"sowing and reaping"--wrong actions
inevitably produce punishment, good actions their reward.
Salvation consists of doing good in excess of evil in order
to evolve to the highest state through successive incarnations.
This highest state is Enlightenment--the realization of oneness
with the World-Soul, Reality.

<p>
MORMONISM

<p>
<a name="1950qlink2">Adam cried, "Because of my transgression my eyes are opened,
and in this life I shall have joy" (Pearl of Great Price,</a> Moses
5:10-11).

<p>
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES

<p>
Sin is a falling short of God's mark of perfection, transgression of
His righteous law (MS, p. 456).

<p>
SPIRITUALISM

<p>
Man never had a fall.

<p>
Whatever is, is right. Evil does not exist. Evil is good. No matter
what man's path may be, good or bad, it is the path of divine
ordination and destiny. (Childs, Whatever Is, Is Ri

<p>
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE

<p>
Sin, sickness, and death are to be classified as effects of error.
Christ came to destroy the belief of sin (SH, 473 :4-6).

<p>
BIBLICAL CHRISTIANITY

<p>
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law, for sin is
the transgression of the law (I John 3:4).

<p>
-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-

<p>
I think a univocal meaning of "Sin" could be extracted by
induction from these statements, but the result would not
be a proper logical definition but rather a metaphor. This
is needed to judge whether there is at least a symbolic
referent for the term or whether it is literally "pointless".

<p>
Unfortunately, this entire page is now beginning to exude
<a name="1916qlink1">Nietzsche's "odor of sanctity"; it is caustic and putrid at
once -- a chthonic smell of the subterranean deliquescence
of something still partly alive.  Unbearable -- why must
people talk about things like this? I must dispatch the
letter at once!</a>
