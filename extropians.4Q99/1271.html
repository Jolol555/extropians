<a name="1283qlink1">Well first of all-reincarnation is not my orientation, so its not</a> my burden 
<a name="1283qlink2">to defend. As far as the Moon being made of green cheese, my</a> point primarilly 
<a name="1283qlink3">is; not what actually physical laws are, but what happend to them</a> in the face 
<a name="1283qlink4">of activated intelligence?  To this I utilize author, Ray Kurzweil, who 
states:

<p>
"Ultimately, intelligence will be a force to reckon with, even for the Big 
Celestial forces. The laws of physics are not repealed by intelligence,</a> but 
<a name="1289qlink1"><a name="1283qlink5">they effectively evaporate in its presence."</a></a>

<p>
So if one postulates the need for the moon to be made of green cheese (as 
un-appealing and non-sensical as this may be) it may occur, if only in a 
virtual sense; in the coming millennia's, via advanced technical achievements.

<p>
The crux is whether you find value in intelligence. If not, then the physical 
forces that we are familiar with today have the ultimate say, and humankind 
is ephemeral and of no significance-even to itself. In which case, one then 
runs against extropian philosophy and embraces nihilism-a different kettle of 
fish indeed!
