<a name="3270qlink1">Among Gina's most recent offerings was this link to a Wired article about the 
current state of cold fusion research:

<p>
<a name="3239qlink1">      <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.11/coldfusion.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.11/coldfusion.html</a>

</a><p>
I recommend<a name="3239qlink2"> it.  It's a very well written piece of "science anthropological 
journalism" about the history and current state of the cold fusion research 
</a>community.<a name="3239qlink3">  I'm not competent to judge the technical merits of anything 
that's described in the article, but WOULD be curious to see the reactions of 
folks better able to assess the current state of the art described there.</a>

<p>
<a name="3239qlink4"><a name="3189qlink1">One thing that was a little disturbing about the article was the account of 
how the scientific and R&amp;D community seems set against even a moderately 
funded investigation of what is an undeniably interesting and mysterious 
physical phenomenon.  What's described in the Wired article seems well worth 
</a>

looking into.
