It depends on what survives.  If starting a war means your entire country is
destroyed, but your missiles survive and can therefore destroy your
attacker, no one will start a war.  If, OTOH, a ruthless government can
expect to survive an attack and rebuild, the situation becomes very
unstable.  There is a temptation to go ahead and use the nukes, especially
if advanced technology also makes it easy to rebuild afterward.

Moderately advanced nanotech would allow a society to build entire military
bases and industrial complexes thousands of feet below ground, where they
would be very resistant to weapons of mass destruction (WOMD).  Mature
nanotech would allow an entire nation to move several miles underground,
with the surface given over to missile defenses and robotic weapons.  In
this scenario WOMD no longer live up to their name, MAD becomes impossible
to achieve, war between superpowers becomes feasible again, and the
collateral damage from any significant war could easily sterilize the
surface of the planet.

Good new if you are da fuhrer.  Very bad news if you are a whale, or an
environmentalist.  Uncertain news for ordinary citizens - you trade a small
risk of complete annihilation for a much higher risk of moderate casualties.
