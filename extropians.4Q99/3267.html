If you will reread my message, you will notice I use the word "inhuman"
once and only once, in the first paragraph. The reference is to my Germanic
ancestors, and was intended to emphasize the devasting contrast between
what happened in Nazi Germany and the German people themselves. The
term is used as an negation, not an attribution.

<p>
At no time do I attribute personal characteristics of any kind to Adolph
Hitler.

<p>
The final paragraph is introspective, and the phrase "psychopathic predator"
neither refers to Hitler nor any other individual but to my query about human
nature or what it means for all of us to be human.  It expresses a modal
doubt about the actual effectiveness of socialization or civilization when
the barbaric again and again historically to overwhelms it.  This is all 
the more distressing because cultures descending into barbarism do not seem 
to be aware of what is happening to them.<a name="3273qlink1"> I'm afraid you will find it
