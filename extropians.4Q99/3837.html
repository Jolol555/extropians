chronic

it's

research
<br>
<a href="3832.html#3837qlink4">&gt;is prohibited, but fortunately MDMA and analogues action is similar to some</a><br>
<i>&gt;serotonin affecting antidepressants, and I hope further research leaves to</i><br>
safer and
<br>
<a href="3832.html#3837qlink5">&gt;more effective drugs.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3859qlink1">Yes, one of the side effects (related to the illegality of it) will put one in
prison for possession.</a>

<p>
<a href="3832.html#3837qlink6">&gt;It is interesting to note that MDMA is not just the love drug it has many</a><br>
<i>&gt;interesting effects, like the reduction of agressiveness, improved outlook,</i><br>
easiness
<br>
<a href="3832.html#3837qlink7">&gt;to solve problems, improved self esteem, it's also very effective for some</a><br>
people
<br>
<a href="3832.html#3837qlink8">&gt;against addiction, if you've been paying attention these are the qualities that</a><br>
many

that

<p>
Perhaps that helps to explain why the corrupt US government has made it illegal?
(Pardon my harping on this. I just watched a PBS documentary about the so-called
"war on drugs.")

<p>
<a name="3859qlink2"><i>&gt;LSD also affects serotonin so this might explain why some users</i><br>
<a href="3832.html#3837qlink11">&gt;find some of these positive effects with that drug, hopefully further research</a><br>
leads
<br>
<a href="3832.html#3837qlink12">&gt;to the discovery of some really useful, powerful and safe mind altering</a><br>
chemicals.

<p>
<a name="3850qlink1">Do you suppose the Global Brain, the cyber god, the SI, Metaman, posthuman AI,
transhumans, or whatever we choose to call that which emerges from accelerated
ultra-technology will become interested in psychedelics? Or will it take the
conservative route and try to wipe out, persecute, pillory, and imprison drug
users?</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3859qlink3"><a href="3832.html#3837qlink13">&gt;it is really a very interesting era to live</a> in!</a><br>

<p>
Yep, we live in interesting times, as the cliche goes. Wait a minute... an ocean
just went through my mind. No, never mind. The music on the radio just looked
like a tsunami crashing on a rose petal. It'll wear off by tomorrow, or
sometime.

Take care,

One of the singular things about writing for The Irish Times, I
find, is that whenever I write anything even mildly challenging to
the prevailing D'Olier Street wisdom, I find myself confronted
by a phalanx of respondents seeking to represent me as the
opposite of themselves.
