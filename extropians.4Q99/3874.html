<p>
This seems to be one of the current theories for MDMA toxicity, I saw
some articles in medline where they tried various neuroprotectants to
reduce metabolite toxicity (not with much success, if I understood
them right). But MDMA doesn't have to be present in the hippocampus to
impair its function if it damages the raphe nuclei which sends
serotonin there - the brain is obviously rather good at long-range
effects.

<a href="3865.html#3874qlink3">&gt; It'd be interesting to know if this is an effect caused by MDMA or</a><br>
<i>&gt; it's analogues like MDA, MDE etc that are commonly found on E pills</i><br>
<i>&gt; or even sold as E because they have similar effects, I have heard</i><br>
<i>&gt; that MDA is twice as neurotoxic as MDMA so probably other compounds</i><br>
<i>&gt; are more neurotoxic or no neurotoxic at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Another theory is that this effect might be caused by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; adulterants found on E pills like amphetamines or cocaine, or on</i><br>
<i>&gt; other compounds sold as E like DXM</i><br>

<p>
Since the animal experiments were done using pure MDMA, I think the
serotonine impairment is a MDMA (or metabolite) effect rather than due
to adulterants.

<p>
<a href="3865.html#3874qlink4">&gt; Neural networks are a lot like holograms, in that you can remove or</a><br>
<i>&gt; damage part of them and the built-in redundancy will keep things</i><br>
<i>&gt; working more or less properly (perhaps with a bit less</i><br>
<i>&gt; flexibility). Once you get to a certain threshold, however, it gets</i><br>
<i>&gt; rapidly worse. Think about it like a curve ball; from the batter's</i><br>
<i>&gt; perspective, the ball goes in a straight line and then suddenly</i><br>
<i>&gt; darts away, even though it's really making a steady arc.</i><br>

<p>
Sometimes. Neural networks can be robust in some dimensions but not in
others. In this case the damage is likely to the relatively few
serotonin-producing cells, and they have a much wider effect on the
rest of the brain since they modulate activity.  So it is not a
quation about losing 1% of all neurons, just losing many percent of a
few important neurons. Still, the brain is good at adapting, so there
are checks and balances too that might help here.
