Howzabout the amazon.com version?

                     Excellent and lucid explanation of basic complexity 
concepts 
                     Prof. Cilliers's elucidation of the key elements of 
</pre>
complexity theory is not only informative but fascinating reading. 
He has taken two
<pre>
                     subjects (complexity and post-modernism), each of 
</pre>
which can be frustrating and confusing to the average reader, 
clearly explained
<pre>
                     them, and then convincingly related them to each 
</pre>
other. By describing each of these subjects in the context of the 
other (in true
<pre>
                     post-structural style), Prof. Cilliers makes each of 
</pre>
them more understandable. Highly recommended! --This text refers 
to the
<pre>
                     hardcover edition of this title

                     There's no denying that rule-based ethical models 
</pre>
are inappropriate and indeed do an unjustice to humanity when 
placed in today's
<pre>
                     complex world - and Cillers clearly identifies why 
</pre>
this is so. Bravo.More! More!

                     An interesting view into complexity 
                     Though it helps to have a better understanding of the 
</pre>
modern philosophy of science, it is not necessary in order 
understand the idea
<pre>
                     the book presents to the reader. It is very well 
</pre>
thought out, cogent and I would recommend it to anyone who is 
interested in
<pre>
                     cross-disciplined approaches to understanding 
</pre>
concepts. I appreciate the process oriented nature of his thesis 
and how the classic
<pre>
                     Newtonian physics are inadequate to defining our 
</pre>
rapidly changing universe. Be prepared to think, but prepare 
yourself for a good
<pre>
                     adventure.

                     Good introduction to complex systems 
                     Of the two I've read, this is by far the better 
</pre>
introduction to complexity. Though sometimes redundant, Cilliers's 
book fleshes out the
<pre>
                     skeletal abstractions, and makes Derrida palatable 
</pre>
even to the general reader. --This text refers to the hardcover 
edition of this

                     A reader from CT, USA , January 24, 1999  
                     Clearly written and argued 
                     An excellent well-rounded introduction to 
</pre>
complexity, presented in a clear and well-referenced manner. 
Cilliers outlines the
<pre>
                     philosophical underpinnings for many of the central 
</pre>
issues in complex systems. The introductory chapter includes the 
most
<pre>
                     straightforward explanation of the properties of 
</pre>
complex systems that I've seen (far better than Lewin, Waldrop, or 
Gell-Mann). A
<pre>
                     must-own for anyone interested in complexity or 
</pre>
cognitive and neural systems, or philosophy of science for that 
matter.
