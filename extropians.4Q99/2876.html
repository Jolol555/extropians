Man: Some of the tech dreams have come out true in the middle.

<p>
Woman: Well, what on Earth does that mean?

<p>
Man: _I_ don't know---they just told me to come in here and say that there was 
extremely rapid acceleration of technological development, that's all.  I 
didn't expect a kind of Singularity.

<p>
(JARRING CHORD---the door blasts open and a transhumanist enters, flanked by <br>
two junior colleagues.)

<p>
Transhumanist: Nobody expects the Singularity!  Its chief cause is nanotech . 
. . nanotech and AI . . . AI and nanotech. . . .  Its two causes are AI and 
<pre>
nanotech . . . and intelligence augmentation. . . .  Its _three_ causes are 
AI, nanotech, and intelligence augmentation . . . and an almost insatiable 
desire to upload. . . .  Its _four_ . . . no. . . .  _Amongst_ its causes. . . 
</pre>
.  Amongst its causes . . . are such elements as AI, nanotech. . . .  I'll 
come in again.  (Exits with colleagues.)

<p>
Man: I didn't expect a kind of Singularity.

<p>
Transhumanist: Nobody expects the Singularity!  Amongst its causes are such 
diverse elements as: AI, nanotech, intelligence augmentation, an almost 
insatiable desire to upload, and nice secret laboratories---oh, damn!
