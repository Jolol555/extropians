Well said, however not everyone who believes in God, or at least, hopes to 
believe in God need be numbered amongst the Christian Fundamentalists. Why 
some of us are even hated by them, who bury their hatred under the veneer of 
"love".  I believe that evolutionary adaptation is the stongest body of 
evidence that there is (along with the notion that the earth isn't flat).  I 
also wonder about the hypothesis of emergence, and wonder how that works. I 
also believe in God, though I am not sure why, nor do I have an answer for 
evil, in this regard.

<p>
I am aware of the hunger for power that many religious leaders have (I am 
currently readling Hitler's Pope by John Cornwell) and am not naive in this 
regard.  However, neither am I unaware of the mentality of some of the 
atheists, who curiously, seem to wish to proselytize their belief, and do 
based on the notions that all religions are identical to fundamentalist 
Christianity-it isn't so.
