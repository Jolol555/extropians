&lt;&lt;   I think I posted to another list the notion that
 if we manage to work out some means of greatly extending life,
 we may need to work out a way of methodically discarding information
 from our brains:
 
<p>
 Randomly eliminating memories?
<br>
 Systematically erasing the oldest memories?
 How about eliminating those memories of ourselves doing something
 stupid or embarrassing?  That should free up a lotta space in my case.

<a name="3062qlink1">Or how about consolidating redundant memories.</a>  Where there are several 
memories which are not very unique or important, they could be consolidated 
into just a handful of abstract memories, such as one memory of walking to a 
particular school when young.  One archtypal composite memory could probably 
serve as well as memories of every time I walked to school.  A few memorable 
walks might remain separate, or as additions to the composite memory.  I 
suspect that redundant events are already stored this way to some extent.
