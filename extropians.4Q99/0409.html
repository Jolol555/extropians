<a href="0372.html#0409qlink1">&gt; Also, school should be optional.  If schools were optional we as a people</a><br>

allowing
<br>
<a href="0372.html#0409qlink2">&gt; government to tell us what we can and cannot do), and education would</a><br>
become

than

<a name="0435qlink2">I must say I could not disagree with this more. The increase of the
education level of the general population is a desireable thing in and of
itself, if for no other reason than it makes each individual more a more
productive contributor to the economy.</a>

<p>
<a name="0435qlink3"><a name="0413qlink1">Are you suggesting _all_ education be optional? How many 7-year-olds do you
know who have a thirst for knowledge?</a> By your scheme, we'd have a generation
of functional illiterates who can't read a street sign or multiply 6x7.
Guess what happens to your personal standard of living when the economy
tanks because of the ensuing labor-quality crisis? When there's nobody
around to run the machinery, the machinery stops.

<a name="0435qlink4">A little government saying "You must learn enough to have the potential to
be a productive member of society" isn't a bad thing; it's crucial.</a>
