This is likely something that differs from university to
university. Here we have undergraduate courses in neural networks,
cognitive psychology, AI and even some biomedicine including
neuroscience. It might not be that deep, but it is at least possible
to get a "sip" of the stuff. But it is still clear that many students
feel that all the good stuff is beyond their level, and they get very
excited when you drop it into their courses (I have had great fun
throwing in the occasional neuropsychology perspective in a course on
text and image processing I helped with).
