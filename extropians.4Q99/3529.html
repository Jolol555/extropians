accelerations/deccelerations this way, without having to have reaction
mass onboard. On the Moon, this is just a longish (10 km? 50 km? This
way there is even no need for saline) electromagnetic railway, the end
being a Moon surface tangent. Each segment is powered by an energy
spike cache, driven by a smallish PV array, giving the launch vehicle
a small push as it slides by.

<p>
Atmospheric drag limits this to low velocities, the lower the denser
the atmosphere. You could probably pull that trick on Olympus Mons,
but not on Mars surface. You would be probably still jelly if you slam
into the atmosphere without the liquid acceleration cushion and rocket
assistance even on the top of Auld Olympus.
