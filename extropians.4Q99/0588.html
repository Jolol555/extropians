<i>&gt;     &gt;natural" object whose properties are omniscence, omnipresence,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;and omnipotence, then I suppose the human dualities of  "good-</i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;evil", "loving-sadistic" and so on cannot, by definition, have</i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;the slightest relevance to the essence of this object. In this</i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;sense, Bryan, it is also inappropriate to say "God is Good".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree. If good and evil exist independently of God then He has nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do with morality except that He's supposed to obey moral law just like</i><br>
<i>&gt; everybody else. He can't be omnipotence either. If good and evil are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not independent of God then doing good is just a matter of avoiding</i><br>
<i>&gt; punishment and no loftier than obeying what the Nazi's tell you to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; if they occupy your country. One must be true if God exists but I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; found that most people are unhappy with either conclusion, so I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; make this argument much anymore, except to Extropians because</i><br>
<i>&gt; they're not most people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Such a being could not simultaneously be omniscient and 
omnipotent.  If omnipotent, (s)he/it would have the power to change 
the future, and thus could not know it for certain; if omniscient, 
(s)he/it would know the future for certain, and therefore could not 
change it.  Like the mythical irresistible force and immovable 
object, these two properties cannot coinhere in a single universe.  
Not only that, but omnipresence is equivalent to a lack of 
presence, for one can only possess a perspective or point of view 
relative to an other, or that which one is not.  In the case of 
omnipresence, no such other can exist (there not being a place for 
such an other), thus there could be nothing upon which an 
omnipresence could establish or maintain any perspective.  Also, 
frames of reference can only exist in multiples; there must be at 
least two to establish the differential context necessary for 
mutually definitional comparison and contrast.  Omnipresence 
lacks such referential grounding.
