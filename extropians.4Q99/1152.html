Beyond defining new forms of deviation, APA members and their brethren
have also promulgated the notion that there are preferred personalities.
That some personalities are better, or healthier, than others.  For example,
that freely expressing your emotions is better than holding them in check.

<p>
Finding _Please Understand Me_ years ago was a breath of fresh air.  Its tone 
in describing the 16 poles of the Myers-Briggs Personality Inventory was that
these are all valid personalities.  You are encouraged to understand someone
else's perspective rather than try to change them.

I'm fascinated by how different professions attract different personalities,
and the consequences of this.  Most computer programmers are INTP, which 
is only 1% of the general public.  If you are a programmer, how do you design 
software that a salesman (ESFJ) will use?  92% of teachers are SJ or NF, 
yet they have to connect with students of all types.  If you are a Judging 
teacher, how do you avoid penalizing Perceiving students?

<a name="1297qlink1">I would bet that 95% of the subscribers to this list are NT (only 12% of 
general public), that at least 70% are xNTP (6% of public),</a> and that at least 
<a name="1297qlink2">40% are INTP (1% of public).  This is a hurdle that no one has mentioned in 
propagating our ideas.</a>
