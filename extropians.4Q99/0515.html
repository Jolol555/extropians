<i>&gt; And they shouldn't is my point.  A society that chooses to burden themselves</i><br>

<a name="0519qlink1">True, maybe they shouldn't. And maybe parents are suckers,

<a href="0500.html#0515qlink2">&gt; &gt;It simply is not in the nature of most of us, to enjoy luxuries while</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;people around us are starving.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously you have never lived on the streets.  I had lived on the streets</i><br>

<i>&gt; care what life they choose for themselves?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0533qlink1"><a name="0519qlink2">Street people aren't on the street because they can't take
care of themselves.</a>
<br>
<a name="0533qlink2">They are there because the have social problems.  They
</a>
either don't want help or
</a>
<br>
they drive away people who could help them.

<p>
<a href="0500.html#0515qlink3">&gt; &gt;Hence, society will try to pressure you into getting educated no matter</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;what.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most people who are homeless are there due to mental illness.  It doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter how much education you give them they will never get any better, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; who's to say they want to.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0519qlink3">That is true. The idea that everybody can be helped is a
fantasy.  But it is a
</a>
<br>
fantasy that many people believe.

<p>
<i>&gt; Give them the choice of augmenting their mind</i><br>
<a href="0500.html#0515qlink4">&gt; but don't force them.  If they choose to stay the way they are then so be</a><br>
<i>&gt; it.  It's not my problem and I won't allow it to be either.  Why will I</i><br>
<i>&gt; burden myself over someone who doesn't want to be helped?  I'm not.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; burdened society brings it upon themselves.</i><br>

<p>
If you pay taxes, you pay for it.

<p>
<a href="0500.html#0515qlink5">&gt; &gt;It may well be your education is nobody else's business, but society does</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;have a vested interest in making sure that you are capable of taking care</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of yourself and making a positive contribution to society.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, don't.  Society burdens themselves when they force people to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; things they don't want to do.  If someone wants to kill themselves whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are mental or not, so what.  It's a choice they make and not for me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; tell them otherwise.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0533qlink3">Actually, if all it took to kill ourselves was to wish to be
dead for 1 second,
<br>
we would all be dead.  If someone truly wants to kill
</a>
themselves, then fine.
<br>
<a name="0533qlink4">But in most cases people who are 'rescued' are grateful. 
Don't argue with
<br>
societies impulse to protect its members. Argue with the
</a>
harmful, dysfunctional
<br>
way it does it.

<p>
<a href="0500.html#0515qlink6">&gt; &gt;I think it is 'wrong headed' the way society tries to pressure people into</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;getting more years of 'education', instead of encouraging learning of all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;types.  But society looks after its own self interest, and attempting to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;make society not do that because of 'principals' is like arguing with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;hungry lion. You can't win.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Winning is just a matter of showing people their ignorance.  Start by</i><br>
<i>&gt; tearing apart their stupid religious and moral faith.  Then give them a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; logical moral.  The new moral code is based of the self.  What it takes for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the individual to survive and live any way it pleases.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0620qlink1"><a name="0519qlink4">Ayn Rand who wrote about the Virtue of Selfishness, didn't
argue with the
<br>
impulse people have to help each other.  Instead she argued
that people should
</a>
<br>
help each other for perfectly selfish reasons.
