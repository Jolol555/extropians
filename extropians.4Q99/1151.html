First some facts (with a very Americo-centric viewpoint):

<p>
<a href="http://library.advanced.org/19012/gallup.htm">http://library.advanced.org/19012/gallup.htm</a>
The following are the results of a poll conducted November 21-24, 1991 by 
the Gallup Organization.  I don’t believe things have gotten any better 
since this poll:

<p>
"God created man pretty much in his present form at one
time within the last 10,000 years."
<pre>
All Americans		47%
Men			39%
Women			53%
College Graduates	25%
No High School Diploma	65%
Income &gt;$50,000		29%
Income &lt;$20,000		59%
Whites			46%
Blacks			53%

</pre>
<p>
“Man has developed over millions of years from less
advanced forms of life, but God guided this process,
including man's creation.”
<pre>
All Americans		40%
Men			45%
Women			54%
College Graduates	54%
No High School Diploma	23%
Income &gt;$50,000		50%
Income &lt;$20,000		28%
Whites			40%
Blacks			41%

</pre>
<p>
“Man has developed over millions of years from less
advanced forms of life. God had no part in this process.”
<pre>
All Americans		9%
Men			11.5%
Women			6.6%
College Graduates	16.5%
No High School Diploma	4.6%
Income &gt;$50,000		17%
Income &lt;$20,000		6.5%
Whites			9%
Blacks			4%

</pre>
<p>
I offer the entirety of the data here in the interest of fairness and 
completeness.  To a religious person seeking confirmation of the thesis that 
the majority of Americans are moderate in their views, I suppose the figures 
indicating that as many as 53% of American men believe that humans came into 
existence more than 10,000 years ago would seem impressive.  To me, the idea 
that as many as 47% of people would be willing to admit that they think such 
a thing is depressing beyond the ability of words to express.

<p>
Consider this: An avowed atheist or even agnostic could no more be elected 
to national office in the United States than pigs could fly.  Except perhaps 
in New York, San Francisco or LA, such a person couldn't be elected dog 
catcher.  Jessie Ventura is the exception that proves the rule and his 
honesty will almost surely ensure that the religious right will fund a 
campaign against him that will probably succeed.  Reference to and 
profession of belief in the supernatural is in fact a prerequisite for any 
public life outside of media and the arts.  On second thought, in the latter 
areas of public life, belief in the supernatural is just as much a 
prerequisite, it's just that you can't seem to be a pop star unless you've 
bought into the latest brand of New Age BS.

<p>
The same situation applies in private institutions.  Open expression of 
religious sentiment is considered to be not only acceptable but a sign of 
trustworthiness and fitness for leadership in most private institutions in 
most sectors of U.S. society. Don't get me wrong: I've been a success in my 
career, despite not participating in any of these activities.  But it's 
because I've been smart and kept my mouth shut.

<p>
Now, what does all this have to do with “religion bashing”?  Sure, the true 
theocrats are under 20%.  But how often does a "moderate" religious leader 
speak out strongly in favor of a firm separation of church and state?  How 
many of them have ever espoused the view that exemption from taxation 
amounts to a state subsidy to religion?<a name="1172qlink1">  Real opposition to theocracy has to 
come from the tiny minority of truly secular humanists.</a>  Look what happened 
to George Bush, Sr. in 1992: He was bullied into<a name="1172qlink2"> expressing views with which 
he didn't personally agree because the moderates were silenced by fear of 
</a>
their "holier" brethren.  Steve Forbes is choosing to do the same thing now, 
marking him as an enemy of reason.

<p>
Separation of church and state is a secular value.  One finds little or no 
authority for it in the Bible. ("Render unto Caesar . . ." being only an 
admonition to observe civic obligations to a foreign conquering power, not 
an endorsement of a secular state.)  Notwithstanding a few Supreme Court 
opinions that the vast majority of Americans do not understand, this IS a 
christian country and religious leaders find little institutional support 
for effective advocacy of the secular value of separation of church and 
state.

<p>
This despite the fact that some of the key figures of American history saw 
things otherwise:

<p>
   "The United States is in no sense founded upon the Christian religion."

<UL>
  <li>  George Washington


</UL>
<p>
   "I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature"

<UL>
  <li>  Thomas Jefferson


</UL>
<p>
   The Bible is not my book, and Christianity is not my religion.
   I could never give assent to the long, complicated statements of 
Christian
<p>
      dogma."

<UL>
  <li>  Abraham Lincoln


</UL>
<p>
The overwhelming majority of Americans are religious in the sense that they 
believe fairly firmly in the existence of supernatural "powers" that 
intervene in human affairs.  Furthermore, the majority of Americans do not 
have a real comprehension of the scientific method or its implications for 
daily life or a personal understanding of nature and human life: They treat 
"science" as some sort of toy factory that produces medical miracles, video 
games, cell phones and the occasional space adventure (in which "spaceships" 
go WHOOSH and bank like airplanes).  Beyond that, they figure that some 
unseen Big Guy is basically in charge of the universe and they strongly 
suspect that "science" is something that makes you unattractive to women and 
leads to the desire to build large underground "laboratories" from which to 
launch a campaign of world domination.  This occasionally requires the 
violent intervention of a suave British spy and a large-breasted woman to 
avoid global destruction.

<p>
What does religion have to do with this?  If you think that an unseen Big 
Guy is in charge of the universe and can change the rules any time he wants, 
you don't develop deep-seated tools for critical thinking.  If you think 
that the basic plan of Life, the Universe and Everything is contained in a 
single book, half of which was written by nomadic shepherds and half of 
which was written by eleven Jewish fisherman, one Greek mystic and a Roman 
motivational writer, all of whom took dictation form the Big Guy, then you 
don't develop the habit of independent, skeptical thought.

<p>
Strong FEELINGS against religion here (as opposed to what we THINK about it) 
are probably due to being part of an infinitesimally small minority of 
humanity.  The majority of people in the First World profess some religious 
or supernatural belief and have little or no conception of the scientific 
method.  Outside the First World, it's much worse.  Of course, even though 
we are an insignificant minority in numbers, science and enlightened 
humanism has had an influence greater than any other cultural movement in 
history.  All the praying of all the holy men in all the history of man 
never killed a single germ or built a single bridge.  The whispers of haints 
or ghosts or saints or gods never developed a notion of crop rotation or 
located a drop of oil.  If it had been left up to the priests, we'd still 
believe that the sun revolved around the earth, that sin causes disease and 
that witches cast spells and must be burned.  Being smart, men of commerce 
now hedge their bets, and offer a little tithe to the keepers of the toy 
store from which the miracles of science may be procured; but they still 
pour their money into the old priesthood, too, just in case the Big Guy's 
still in charge.
