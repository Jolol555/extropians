Hello Max and Natasha,

<p>
I checked out the ad for the upcoming book reading and wish I could attend.  
But living in Alaska tends to be isolating at times.  I wrote this post to 
compliment you both on your photos.

<p>
Natasha you look fantastic in the picture there!  You have a "Jean Grey" 
thing going for you in that shot.

<p>
And for Max, that picture makes you look to me like a rogish member of the 
nefarious Hellfire club!  You have that Sebastion Shaw/Fitzroy look about 
you!

<p>
Can you tell that I was going through my X-Men collection earlier? lol If I 
were casting director for the upcoming movie I would keep you two in mind.

<p>
I love the X-Men when well written and drawn.  I see Professor Xavier as a 
real extropian along with Forge, Beast and others.  As a teenager I wished 
there really was a Charles Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters that I could 
attend.  Of course I would need the required kinks in my DNA to get in!


<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg

<p>
P.S.  I had friends who really wanted to attend StarFleet Academy!
