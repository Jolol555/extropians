If you think patents are wonderful and needed to help all those poor
inventors get a start, what do you think of this? All patents are absurd,
but this one just shows why.

<p>
<i>&gt; Amazon.com Receives Patent for 1-Click Shopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the attack-of-the-dumb-patents dept.</i><br>
&gt; "It looks like Amazon has patented the storing of credit-card and shipping<br>
&gt; info and then using it to facilate online purchasing via a single click.<br>

<p>
<a name="0775qlink1">Do you reall ythink that the idea of clicking a button to buy something
needs patent protection for someone to invent</a> it?

<p>
The only people who need the protection are the companies with 200 and 300
PE ratios running to cover their arses.

<p>
buy your books from www.booksamillion.com - they are cheaper anyhow.
