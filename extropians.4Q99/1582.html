I believe that people will become gradually accustomed to faster and
faster change.  So the "certain pace" that people are unwilling to
change faster than, will increase in the future.

<p>
I'm not sure that such statements carry much weight, since they are
after all completely hypothetical.</a>  They reflect more of a political
statement about values, a social attempt to exhibit unselfishness and
</a>
cooperativeness.  It is easy and cheap today to say you wouldn't want to
"hog the earth" for 500 years, because no true sacrifice is involved in
making such a statement.

<p>
I believe that once it is possible actually to live for 500 years in good
health, many fewer people will be willing to kill themselves on principle.
