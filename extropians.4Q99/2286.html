&lt;&lt; Frankly, I'm leaning towards the idea that even human minds will still
 function better without a self-image.  I mean, I have one or two ASIMs
 (ASIM:  Alternate Self-Image) that I can use if I need a personality or
 something, but on the whole, the Universe is a cleaner, simpler place if
 you don't try to distinguish between the several modules composing your
<br>
<a href="2276.html#2286qlink1"> "self" and the rest of the Universe.  So, yes, both selfishness and</a><br>
 altruism are kind of missing the point - but the better way isn't a
 compromise between them; the better way is the truth - modelling the
 Universe without artificial distinctions between the quarks composing
<br>
<a href="2276.html#2286qlink2"> "Eliezer" and all the other quarks.</a><br>
 
<p>
 It's just easier to think without all the artificial asymmetries.  It's
 just easier to think when you're not trying to warp reality because of
 your emotional attachment to some particular outcome.  Maybe that's what
 they call Zen - I wouldn't know, I don't have any formal training in
 Zen.  It just sounds Zenny:  Enlightenment is like sneezing, and the
 self is the snot.

For myself, I find that my self image developed very early and with little 
conscious direction, and have found it quite a useful part of my modeling of 
the universe.  I often frame things in a very egocentric manner, not 
necessarily out of a sense of my own importance, but rather due to my 
intimate familiarity with all things Glen.  By relating everything to myself, 
I have a quasi-stable common point of reference from which I can begin to 
explore the universe.  Also, my self image has grown and developed over the 
years, becoming fuller and richer and deeply connected by associations to som 
much of life.  Does this mean I see through "Glen"-colored glasses?  Probably 
to a certain extent, but I have always had the capacity to imagine and 
empathize what other states than Glen-ness are like, so I can use that to 
check my perceptions (which I often do).

<p>
BTW, have you been using one of those ASIMs in your posts here?  Because to 
me you've always seemed to have quite a strong sense of self in them.  Or 
maybe I'm just projecting onto your blank canvas&lt;g&gt;.
