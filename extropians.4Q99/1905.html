Arthur C. Clarke, TALES OF TEN WORLDS, 1963:

<p>
`Our beliefs were neatly expressed by that famous remark of Tsiolkovsky's,
which I'd hung up for everyone to see as they entered my office:

<pre>
	EARTH IS THE CRADLE OF THE MIND--BUT
	YOU CANNOT LIVE IN THE CRADLE FOREVER

</pre>
<p>
`(What was that? No--of *course* I never knew Tsiolkovsky! I was only four
years old when he died in 1936!)'

<p>
That, obviously, is not Clarke himself speaking... but a character in his
1959 story `Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Orbiting', reprinted in the
collection. ACC was born in 1917.

<p>
Poignantly, that story starts by noting: `The twenty-first century does
*not* begin tomorrow; it begins a year later, on January 1, 2001.' Bad
luck, Arthur. Less than two months away now, and you were right - the
cretins never did learn to count...
