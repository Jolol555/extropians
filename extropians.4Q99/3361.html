<a name="3402qlink2"><a name="3365qlink1">mmm...guys, not sure what this is about, but may I suggest another,
more logical explanation for her reaction?  Abortion is a very
heavy subject for the female half of the population,</a> and it has a 
shock value.  It could be that she had some sort of bad experience
in her life relating to the topic, and just bringing it up out of
the blue may have triggered a reaction.  Similar to suddenly
bringing up, say, rape or robbery, or the death of a family member.
Or, perhaps some overexposure to religious zealots, who delight
in verbally attacking women for no real reason.</a>

<p>
<a name="3365qlink2">So, I hope that you will try to be a bit understanding of her
reaction, and try to have conversations with her on other topics.

<p>
Take care,
<br>
Kathryn
