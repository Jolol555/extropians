Dan,

<p>
It may be much more subtle than this due to partial penetrance
and other offsetting factors.  To go from 25% down to 5-10%
(current estimates of homosexuality) would only take 1-3 more
genes being involved.

<p>
If you take a "hypersexuality" gene, combine it with a
"mate" discrimination gene and a "pheromone" preference
genes and already you are getting enough combinations to
make selection &amp; activity biases very complex.

<p>
I suspect you could subdivide homesexuals into hypersexual
and hyposexual types depending on pheromone matches,
and a combination of genetic &amp; environmental "desirability"
matches.  E.g. if I get a pheromone match and "he" has
characteristics my mother had, I'll go for him, but
if she doesn't match my pheromone/"desirable" mate
profiles, I'd have to be highly hypersexual to go for her.
