<a href="2990.html#3061qlink1">&gt; &gt;Never, never, never sacrifice the stories.  In the final analysis</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;all we've got that makes us unique is collections of good stories.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;(Our skills we can change, our appearence we can change, the underlying</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;genes and even the hardware we run on we can change, but the stories</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;remain our own.)</i><br>

<a name="3092qlink1">Actually, they don't.  Make a copy of yourself that includes memories, and
whadya got?  Two of you, which is by definition non-unique.  Big deal.  The
idea that psychological continuity somehow defines a unique person in rubbish.</a> 
<a name="3092qlink2">I can come up with half-a-dozen ways to create a psychologically continuous
person that is not you (which I would steal from Derek Parfitt's devastating
analysis in "Reasons and Persons") and yet,</a> is you.  If all you want out of
uploading is immortality, think again.<a name="3092qlink3">  Hell, you aint even the person that you
were ten years ago (and I don't mean that you've grown, I mean you are as
different from that person as you are from me, ethically speaking).</a>

<p>
Anyways, that's my two bit of reductionist philosophy for the day.
