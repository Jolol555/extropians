<a name="2503qlink1">In today's issue of the journal "Nature"  Pier Giuseppe Pelicci reports
that he used genetic engineering  to deactivate the p66 gene in mice.
The resulting mice lived 30% longer than the non engineered mice.
Doctor Pelicci suspects that the mechanism is similar to the one
that increases longevity in mice that  have a severe restriction
of calories in their diet except there are even fewer side effects,
the mice do no become very thin and they breed normally. He can
<a name="2361qlink1">not find any down side to the mice at all but he speculates there must be
one someplace because otherwise evolution would already have found
this fix;</a> he thinks it might cause a very slight decrease in fertility in young
mice but if it's there it's too small for him to see in his experiments. He also
</a>
<a name="2503qlink2">says that the a drug  that blocks the protein produced by p66 should be easy
to find because it is similar to others that have already been found.</a>

<p>
<a name="2361qlink2">Just a year or two ago I thought it was a big deal when they found a genetic way
to increase the life of a worm even though it made the creature sluggish,
this was done with a mammal and if there are bad side effects they must
be very subtle. On first reading I'm damn impressed.</a>
