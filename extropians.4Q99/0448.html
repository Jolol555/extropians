Yes, but what is cruel and what is unusual? If you punish all theives
equally by chopping off their hands, its not unusual, is it? And
compared to a cruel murder, merely crippling someone for life is a far
greater kindness, so its not as cruel as what the criminal did now, is
it? If being crippled for life is not cruel for a parent to impart on
their children with inherited handicaps, then its certainly not cruel to
use it as a means of restraint.<a name="0460qlink1"> The term 'cruel and unusual punishment'
<a name="0455qlink1">IMHO is too frequently used by the squeamish to get out of taking
</a>responsiblity to do what needs to be done to punish the wicked and
attain justice for the victimized.</a>
