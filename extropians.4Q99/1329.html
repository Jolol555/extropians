I think you're proving my point by the assumptions and language in your reply.  
Not everyone responds the way you do, and you have to take that into account
if you want to gain converts, or to reduce opposition.

<p>
Reason *is* personal, for most people.

<p>
I just went to the LPNH convention, where Michael Cloud spoke about selling 
the libertarian message.  You're using the language of confrontation.
Argument.<a name="1390qlink1">  War.  "force the guy you're arguing with" is an approach that will
fail more often than it will succeed.  It backs people against a wall.</a>  They

"Let me explain to you how stupid you are.  And you will be so grateful that 
you will thank me, and embrace my ideas."

<p>
The alternative to the battlefield is the marketplace.  You have a great
product to sell.  Use sales techniques.  Focus on what *they* care about --
*their* values, *their* goals -- and show how the extropian future supports 
those things.  Soft sell.

<p>
Of course, Stiegler's "The Gentle Seduction" is a perfect example of this.
