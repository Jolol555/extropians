 &gt;&gt; If ALL people have this property, being a sinner, then there is no contrast.
</pre>
<br>
<a href="1859.html#1909qlink1">&gt;&gt; If there is no contrast then the statement has exactly the same meaning</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; as "all people are saints", and that is no meaning at all.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Oh, give me a break.  Are you saying the statements "All people are made</i><br>
<i>&gt; of atoms" or "All atoms obey the laws of physics" are not meaningful?</i><br>
<i>&gt; [...] all tangerines are not sinners, so "sin" is less general than "atomic substrate".</i><br>

<p>
There is a difference, all atoms are not in people and not all the laws of physics
involve atoms; I was assuming (it's not implicit in the original post I admit) that
not only are all people sinners but all sinners are people. But now that I come to
think about it, that's equivalent to "all non sinners are non people" so your example
of a virtuous tangerine is a little bit of evidence helping to prove the proposition
that all people are indeed sinners. Perhaps the original poster was right after all.

<p>
<a name="1915qlink1">    &gt;I think you're objecting to the fact that "sin" lacks a clear definition,

<p>
No, that's not the problem, nearly all the really important things in life
have no clear definition. My objection is that the idea is pointless.
