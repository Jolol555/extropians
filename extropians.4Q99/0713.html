<a name="0714qlink1">Brain Shocks May Help Depression

<p>
WASHINGTON (AP) _ The former shipbuilder had severe depression
 unrelieved by any of today's therapies, so sick he had trouble even
 leaving his house. Then doctors implanted a pacemaker-like device
 to stimulate a part of his brain thought important for mood _ and
 that very day the man laughed.</a>
<p>
<a name="0771qlink1">     ``It was remarkable,'' recalled Dr. Mark George of the Medical<br>
 University of South Carolina, who performed the experimental
 implant. ``I said, 'Are you being forced to laugh or do you feel
 good inside?' He said both.''</a>
<p>
     Stimulating a nerve that runs from the neck into one of the
 brain's most mysterious regions appears promising enough at
 relieving once-untreatable depression that the government just
 granted permission for a study at 15 hospitals around the country.
<p>
     The treatment, called vagus nerve stimulation, involves sending
 tiny electric shocks into the vagus nerve in the neck, where it
 then relays messages deep into the brain.
<p>
     About half of the 30 depressed patients treated in a pilot study
 _ people who had failed every other treatment _ ``got a very good
 response,'' George said in an interview.
<p>
     The results are not definitive, he cautioned. But he added,
 ``Stimulating there really is a wonderful portal into the base of
 the brain.''
<p>
     Indeed, scientists think stimulating this nerve could have even
 more far-reaching effects, such as enhancing memory or treating
 obesity by curbing appetite.
<p>
     That's because the vagus nerve is what Dr. Mitchell Roslin of
 Brooklyn's Maimonedes Medical Center calls ``one of the information
 superhighways'' between the brain and other organs. It relays
 messages, such as signals to regulate heartbeat, and sends messages
 back to the brain, such as when the stomach is full.
<p>
     The nerve also reaches deep into brain regions thought to
 regulate mood and emotion, said Dr. John Rush of the University of
 Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who heads the pilot depression
 study.
<p>
     If the implant truly signals the depressed brain circuits to act
 more normally, it could prove important for some of the estimated 1
 million Americans with depression uneased by conventional therapy
pacemaker. A generator the
<br>
 size of a pocket watch is implanted into the chest. Wires snake up
 the neck to zap the nerve every few minutes.
<p>
     Two years ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved the
 implant to treat severe epilepsy, a way to signal the brain to
 reduce seizures.
<p>
     Depression often accompanies epilepsy. Soon after the implants
 began selling, doctors began reporting epilepsy patients who felt
 happier even if the implant failed to reduce their seizures.
<p>
     ``There's certainly an overlap between emotions and the site<br>
 where people have intractable seizures,'' said Dr. Cynthia Harden
 of Cornell University, author of one of those early studies.
<p>
     So manufacturer Cyberonics Inc. funded a pilot study of patients
 with untreatable depression not complicated by epilepsy. Full
 results won't be unveiled until December, but George said about
 half the patients responded well _ prompting the FDA last week to
 approve a new study, beginning early next year at 15 hospitals, to
 prove the effect.
<pre>
     The vagus nerve might also fight obesity.
     Because the nerve signals the brain when someone's stomach is
</pre>
 full, Roslin implanted Cyberonics stimulators in dogs to see they
 suppressed appetite. For a week, the dogs continued to gulp
 whatever food was in sight. But gradually their appetite dropped,
 until eventually they left half their food uneaten each day and
 lost one-third of their weight. Then Roslin switched off the
 stimulators, and within five days the dogs' appetite and weight
 rebounded.
<p>
     Roslin hopes to begin an implant study in obese New Yorkers
 early next year to see if they get the same effect.    _
Help stroke or head-injury victims' memory recover.
<p>
     In a study last year, epilepsy patients scored 36 percent better
 at recalling words read just before their vagus nerve was
 stimulated. The theory: Emotional hormones seem to stimulate the
 vagus nerve to store memories, so maybe the implant could mimic
 that effect in injured patients.
<p>
     These potential treatments require much more research to
 determine how to best stimulate the vagus nerve, said George. His
 depressed shipbuilder, for instance, was initially overstimulated
 into a hyper state associated with manic-depression. Later patients
 were better controlled.
<p>
     But because the implant is so unique _ and can immediately be
 switched off if someone suffers a side effect _ scientists are
 encouraged.
