<p>
MOJAVE, Calif., October 18, 1999

<p>
Rotary Rocket Company=92s Roton ATV (Atmospheric Test Vehicle)
approach and landing demonstrator made its first translational
(forward) flight in the envelope expansion flight program, flying
4,300 feet along a Mojave airport runway, at 07:23 am PDT,
Tuesday October 12, 1999. The ATV had previously been
rolled-out for flight on October 6, 1999, but that flight had been
cancelled due to poor weather conditions. This time the weather
at Mojave Airport was perfect with a clear blue sky and no wind.
The 65 feet tall by 22 feet diameter conical vehicle was piloted
by a two person crew comprising the pilot, Dr. Marti Sarigul-Klijn,
Cmdr. USN-Ret and Roton Chief Engineer, with Brian Binnie, Cmdr.
USN-Ret. and Roton Flight Test Director, as copilot. Both crew
members are highly qualified and experienced flight test pilots.

<p>
The flight, the second in the envelope expansion flight test
program for the Roton ATV and the third flight overall, was a
low altitude translational (forward) flight south to north along
Runway 30-12 at Mojave. This flight was to demonstrate the
ability of the Roton ATV to fly at varying speeds under full control
in a forward direction--exactly the same mode of flying that would
be needed by a returning space vehicle maneuvering to land at
an airport. In technical terms, the test was to investigate the
longitudinal stability and control characteristics of the Roton ATV
in forward flight.

<p>
During the test, the ATV reached a maximum altitude of 75 feet
above the Mojave runway and a maximum ground speed of
approximately 53 miles per hour and flew a total of 4,300 feet
along the runway. All values were within parameters planned
for the flight. Observers along the flight path noted that "The
ATV thundered past them like an express train--a truly awesome
experience!" All flight test requirements were exceeded and
exceptionally good flight data was obtained. Preliminary analysis
of the flight data obtained shows good correlation with the ATV=92s
integral hardware-in-the-loop simulator and the flight data will be
used to further fine-tune the simulator.

<p>
After the translation portion of the flight, the pilots used their
remaining fuel allowance to maintain a sustained, controlled, hover
before touching down gently, once again demonstrating the ATV=92s
ability to execute precision, soft, landings. The total test duration
from rotor start to rotor stop was 9 minutes 45 seconds. The total
flight time was 3 minutes 47 seconds, of which 1 minute 50 seconds
was in forward flight and 1 minute 57 seconds was spent in hover
at the end of the flight. The total accumulated flight time on the
ATV is now 6 minutes and 27 seconds

<p>
During the debriefing, the pilots commented that a key factor in
the success of the flight was their ability to plan and rehearse the
flight on the ATV=92s integral hardware-in-the-loop simulator prior to
flight. They said that while the ATV was not at all hard to fly, it
was significantly different to any existing rotorcraft or aircraft,
so practice was required beforehand in order to fly the test profile
smoothly.

<p>
The primary function of the Roton ATV is to demonstrate the
operational viability of vertically landing a returning space vehicle
using a tip thruster powered rotor-blade landing system. The Roton
ATV is similar in concept to the Space Shuttle Enterprise that NASA
built and flew to test the orbiter=92s landing characteristics before
proceeding to build space-worthy version Space Shuttles. The ATV
flight test program will verify the Roton=92s pilot-guided approach
and landing capability over a range of flight regimes.

<p>
Gary C. Hudson, President and CEO of Rotary Rocket Company
said after the successful conclusion of the flight, "An extremely
successful and impressive test. There is now no doubt in our minds,
or in the minds of those present at the test, that the Roton does
fly and, in fact, it flies very well." Hudson added that "The quality
of the flight data obtained from this flight is such that it may well
be possible to reduce the scale of the ATV flight test program without
compromising results. This is an important consideration for a small
company such as ours operating within our budget constraints." He
went on to congratulate the flight crew and other employees of
Rotary Rocket Company for their superb efforts in completing the
flight successfully.

<p>
Rotary Rocket Company=92s Roton piloted reusable space vehicle
will serve the telecommunications satellite market, a more than
$30 billion market, at a fraction of the price of existing commercial
expendable rockets. The Roton will enter into commercial service
in 2001. Rotary Rocket Company has offices in Redwood City,
California, Mojave, California and Washington D.C.
