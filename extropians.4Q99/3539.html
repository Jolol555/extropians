<a href="3536.html#3539qlink1">&gt;&gt;I have grown up hearing a number of men say they wanted to &gt;move there</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;because the women are suppose to be so incredible for some &gt;reason.</i><br>

<p>
We Aussie men bring it out in them, you understand. (Other than those
instances where they bring it out in each other.)

<p>
<a href="3536.html#3539qlink2">&gt;several unrelated sources that Australian girls tend to be markedly and </a><br>
<i>&gt;enthusiastically sexually promiscuous. </i><br>

<p>
I don't know about the girls, but the women... well, why repeat myself? :)

<p>
<i>&gt;I do not mean to offend anyone,</i><br>

<p>
There's always that risk when using a loaded word like `promiscuous',
rather than just `adventurous'. 

<p>
But seriously, folks - Oz is a largely post-repressive non-Xian culture
(despite mandatory obeisance to &lt; god &gt; and Church-of-England Queen and
plenty of tight-lipped pests in powerful places), and the climate and
abundant good food makes it easy to be healthy and hence good-looking,
except for the sad cases like me who turned out bookish and indoorsy and
never learned to drive a car (hark, do I hear an answering whimper from
Alaska?)... but even for such a luckless drone, I have been blessed by the
interest and affection (on and off, over the years, mostly off recently) of
some startlingly smart, beautiful, sexy women. Ho hum.

<p>
I'd rather be in New York, though.
