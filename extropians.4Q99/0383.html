<i>&gt; &gt; The trouble with THIS attitude is that it promotes cramming, as students</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do no work during the year, cram to pass the test, and then forget the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; material.  Providing incentives to work throughout the year is a valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; part of the educational process.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't buy that argument at all: first, nothing prevents teachers from</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing any kind of testing or evaluation they want at any time.  The fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that such tests "don't count" should make them more honest evaluations</i><br>
<i>&gt; because the student feels no economic pressure to cheat on them.  Having</i><br>
<i>&gt; the credentialing authority be separate prevents even the teacher from</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowing exactly what will be tested, and therefore /discourages/ cramming</i><br>
<i>&gt; because it would be useless.   It also discourages teachers with "pet"</i><br>
<i>&gt; theories that they stress and test for at the expense of the broader</i><br>
<i>&gt; field of study itself.  Teachers themselves are not evaluated at all in</i><br>
<i>&gt; this model--they just acquire reputation based on how well their classes</i><br>
<i>&gt; perform with the credentialing authorities.</i><br>

<p>
And as I pointed out in my original proposal for Institutes of
Verification - not currently on the Web, I'm afraid - such Institutes,
being specialized, could devote far more effort to verification than is
currently spent.  They would almost certainly use better methods of
examination than multiple-choice exams.  A single Institute for
granting, say, doctorates in computer science might serve an entire
state or region, administering a two-week battery of tests including
writing a program in real time, defending a thesis, submitting sample
code, and engaging in discussion of a new idea with a major name in the
field.  How do you cram for that, pray tell?

<p>
I'm pleased to say that various professional certification bodies in the
computing industry seem to be approaching this ideal, although far too
many assume some particular course as a prerequisite.
