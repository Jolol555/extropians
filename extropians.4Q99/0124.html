&gt;  has interest in the topic to ask questions and stimulate<br>
&gt;  discussion after the short presentation.<br>

<p>
This is very much like an idea some of us have been discussing for sessions 
at EXTRO5, blending it with the so-called "birds of a feather sessions".  
There's been a pretty solid consensus of feedback that more discussion and 
Q&amp;A would be a good thing.  The idea would be to have papers available well 
in advance of the conference and also on paper at the conference, and then 
have combinations of panel discussions, formal Q&amp;A and open discussion 
groups.  Whether this should be multi-tracked or not is another question, as 
many folks would be torn between being in simultaneous sessions.
