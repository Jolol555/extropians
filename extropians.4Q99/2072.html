Looks like we could send independent redundant colony seeds.
Not one ship with three women, but three ships with one each.
Isnt that just like an aerospace engineer to suggest that approach? {8^D

<p>
This is old ground, but I will ask again: what is the advantage of
a dewar of sperm over a dewar of embryos?  Remember, that
first generation of children will likely be required to mate with
*each other* therefore it is desireable to have them genetically
unrelated.  And, one woman could carry tens of thousands of
them.  I admit it is a high risk approach, but consider greatly
parallel redundancy, and at least one should take hold.

<p>
I got in trouble for suggesting this last time around, about 8
months ago, but looks to me like the potential mothers of
a new race could have their birth canals surgically enlarged
before they go, in order to give them a better chance at
delivering their own babies alone and surviving the ordeal.
Have we any doctors on the list?  Suggestions?  Human
babies have huge heads, compared to the young of other
species, do we not?

<p>
Next, consider using left over military missiles.  I was on
a study back in 1994 in which we were studying what we
could use the solid rockets for, that were obviated by
the signing of an arms limitation agreement with the commies.

<p>
If we removed all the nukes and support equipment, could
we use those things to give a rich people joy rides in LEO?
Answer:  almost.  If the person were not large, and we
dispensed with *all* the luxuries, and we could settle for
a really low orbit, then yes a cheap former-nuke-carrying
solid rocket could be adapted, however this still doesnt
help us in GB's scenario.  We would need something
Saturn V-ish, and that would cost buttloads of money.

<p>
Of course, Im still not getting at GB's question, since
 I was assuming the old fashioned approach and he was
assuming nanotech, about which I know too little to
speculate.  But this much I will stay with: the first colonies
will need small crews, both in stature and numbers.  Maybe one,
Probably two women on each launcher.  This minimal crew
notion will likely hold, even with nanotech.  spike
