Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVES: To determine whether lifelong exposure to
  dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate extends the lifespan or retards immune
  senescence in mice. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention
  trial. SETTING: A specific pathogen-free rodent vivarium. PARTICIPANTS: 120
  mice bred as a cross between CB6F1 females and C3D2F1 males. INTERVENTION:
  DHEAS at 100 microg/mL in drinking water from weaning until death.
  MEASUREMENT: Age at death, cause of death, antibody production after
  erythrocyte immunization, and T cell subset profiles in peripheral blood at
  ages 8 and 18 months. RESULTS: DHEAS ingestion did not lead to a significant
  increase in mean or maximal longevity: the 95% confidence interval for DHEAS
  effect on mean lifespan ranged from +35 days to -80 days. There were no
  significant effects of DHEAS on incidence of lethal illnesses, except for a
  trend toward higher levels of mammary adenocarcinoma in DHEAS-treated females
  and mouse urinary syndrome in DHEAS-treated males. DHEAS
  treatment did not improve the ability of middle-aged mice to
  produce antibody to a foreign particulate antigen, and it did not alter the
  proportions of age-sensitive T cell subsets in middle-aged animals.
  CONCLUSION: Although differences among species in pharmacokinetics complicate
  interpretation of studies in which DHEA or DHEAS is administered to rodents,
  our data provide no support for the idea that chronic exposure to this
  steroid retards immune senescence or prevents late life illness.
