Bio Warfare is of course an ongoing concern. See the following url for
training a rapid response team via VR for such an occurrence. A couple of
related links are included there for "Defeating Biological Warfare" and
"Sniffing Out Bio Weapons."

And then, if Bio Warfare is considered a high risk or high priority item to
your personal organism integrity, you might consider a one-piece positive
pressure personnel suit. Or maybe a laminar flow home with the appropriate
HEPA filtration system in place. Ahhh, but then we'd be talking
biocontainment...and your real goal is bioexclusion, isn't it? &lt;g&gt;
