I am aware of the impact on short-term memory that mdma has, though I have 
_never_ heard of someone completely forgetting a conversation, due to its 
effects. Was your (James Roger's) explanation memorable? Do your friends 
care what you say usually? Those that do use it say that the benefits are 
well worth it.

<p>
I wish that people who don't use mdma would accept that the ones that do 
think the costs are justified and are going to continue to use it until the 
DEA has clamped down on every last molecule of mdma in the universe.

<p>
Perhaps all of the NIH funded study money might be better spent 
investigating *why* people use mdma? its powerful heroin-like 
addictiveness? its lugubrious mind-numbing properties? the way it makes 
people who use it appear cool to others?

<p>
Glad to hear some more thoughts on this. If I remember to check my email.



<p>
K.
