<i>&gt; &gt;  There is an interesting paper on this, CAPITALISM: A TREATISE ON</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  ECONOMICS by George Reisman.  Permit me to quote a bit from it:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;snip large portion of quote with which i mostly agree&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  The freedom of production in the United States led to an unprecedented</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  outpouring of innovationsâ€”to the steady introduction of new and pre-</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  viously unheard of products and to the constant improvement of methods</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  of production. This, along with the constant availability of an adequate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  supply of savings to implement the advances, produced the most rapid</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  and sustained rate of economic progress in the history of the world. [39]"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now isn't this a contradiction?  It seems that a free market DOES produce</i><br>
<i>&gt; innovations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I contend that it does.  I also contend that the degree of freedom of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; market and the quantity of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Innovations are directly proportional.  Agreed that the eara (pre income tax)</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; reference is less restrictive than now...but it was not a true 'free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market'.....there were</i><br>
<i>&gt; still taxes and regulations....(the whiskey rebellion comes to mind).....just</i><br>
<i>&gt; not as stifleing</i><br>
<i>&gt; as currently exist..</i><br>

<p>
The point I made in my original post, EvMick, was that "if the free market
worked it would be innovative".  What was illustrated in the quotation above
was a time when it DID more-or-less work and I chose a passage deliberately
that included reference to "an unprecedented outpouring of innovations".

<p>
I don't see any reason why one must be a "capitalist" to see the virtues of
a free market.  Without any currency ("capital") a free market bartering
system would not require any centralized regulation. Although such a system
is inappropriate for macro economies, I use this procedure all the time in my
local micro economy. My eldest son just acquired a B&amp;W cycle by laying a
massive concrete slab for four-car garage and framing it.  I do computer
repair, tutor computer operations, and act as a free-lance system purchasing
 agent for the sheer pleasure of being paid in kind.  Never really cared for
money -- I like vis-a-vis trade. The "value" negotiations involved can be
quite a challenge, but I love it.  All very neurotic, I suppose.  I earn a very
good salary, so why.....
