I'm not sure if she was so much ashamed of her Jewish heritage as just
wanting to break free of any heritage.  In a lot of ways, I think she saw
herself at the beginning of a new tradition, though her ideas are not
totally original...

I disagree.  I think, if you read her _The Virtue of Selfishness_,
_Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology_, and some of her other
nonfiction, you do see her basic method at work, which, I believe, Chris
Sciabarra illustrates well in his _Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical_.  This is
that she tried to dialectically transcend the various schools of philosophy
she saw around her.  Not that she was always consistent; her philosophy some
work.  (See my web site below for areas where I think she got it wrong.:)

<p>
However, her basic method was to take seemingly contradictory views and try
to identify how each can fit together.  Thus, her views of mind-body
integration, fact-value relationships, and her view of how social change
occurred.

<p>
Cheers!
