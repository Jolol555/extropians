Yes, I found the article interesting, but it suffers
from the same flaw as many other articles about
E-prime: it does not make clear the distinction
between the "is of identity" and the "is of
existance".

<p>
The English verb "to be" has two meanings, "to be
identicle to" and "to exist". IT IS ONLY THE FORMER
THAT E-PRIME WAS ORIGINALLY MEANT TO ABOLISH.

<p>
Since the idea was invented, sploppy thinking has
allowed the idea of "E-prime" to change, so that some
people will even say that the sentence:

<p>
<a name="0661qlink1">"I am in Alabama"<br>

<p>
which uses the "to exist" sense of the verb "to be",
must be replaced by something like:

<p>
"My body currently exists within the borders of the<br>
geographical entity known as Alabama."</a>

<p>
This foolishness makes E-prime seem silly to most
people.

<p>
If it has already been pointed out somewhere else on
the list that E-prime is only about abolishing the "is
of identity", not the "is of existence", I apologize
for wasting bandwidth.

<p>
Another point: There already exist languages without a
verb equivalent to the "is of identity" (certain
Brazilian rainforest tribes, "Klingon", etc.) and
cultures which use such languages still manage to have
a lot of fuzzy thinking and superstitions, so nobody
should think that E-prime would be a complete antidote
<a name="0640qlink1">to that sort of thing. For example, this post uses
E-prime, and I'm sure some of you could dispute at
least some of what I'm saying.</a>

<p>
A last point: Any living language changes. English
especially has prospered by having no absolute
authorities to prevent new words from being used. I
suspect that if the "is of identity" did not exist in
any real modern culture (which excludes "Klingon"), it
would be invented in a single generation. This renders
E-prime mainly a useful philisophical idea, not a
realistic goal.
