This was originally going to be in my first message, but
hunger caught up with me and, sandwich making being such an
intellectually challenging process, I forgot all about it.

<a name="1003qlink1">By 2007 I'm pretty damn sure someone somewhere will have
capitalised on the spare CPU cycles.  We'll have a popular
version of something like Spawn, where we can sell our spare
CPU cycles for other spare CPU cycles or money.  In the
event that Joe Average can sell his CPU cycles for mortgage
payments or 'kickass' FPS on Quake 8: Arena he's not likely
to donate it to the Singularity Institute.  You could argue
that this isn't likely to happen within 7 years and, sadly,
I'm inclined to agree but I think any long-term project that
relies on those spare CPU cycles must acknowledge the chance
that there may be no such thing in the future.
