<a href="0656.html#0702qlink1">&gt;&gt; Maybe hyperlearning is the answer, instead of grades, you</a><br>
<i>&gt;identify  reading level, lower level students receive extra</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;classes, which  means they have to stay in school longer, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they're motivated to  learn. At the lowest levels, require the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;parents to come in for  weekend classes with the kids..... The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;idea being to raise all  students to a specific proficiency</i><br>
<i>&gt;level.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The good news is that hyperlearning systems are very cost</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;effective  as software...</i><br>

<a href="0656.html#0702qlink2">&gt;I've often thought that this would be a good idea, that the</a><br>
<i>&gt;savings alone in the reduction of future prison populations (at</i><br>
<i>&gt;$50,000 per year per convict) would more than pay this investment</i><br>
<i>&gt;back.</i><br>

<p>
We agree on this...
 
<p>
<a href="0651.html#0702qlink3">&gt;&gt;I'm sure the National Education Association would really hate</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;this policy and that's pretty good evidence it's a good idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm sure they would hate it, but we disagree as to why....</i><br>
 

<p>
<a href="0656.html#0702qlink4">&gt;Stupid is as union does....</a><br>

<p>
Sorry Mike we don't agree on this one. The vast majority of
scientists in this country are Union, and even the doctors are
organizing now.... Every right you have in the workplace was won
for all workers by the effort of Union labor.

<p>
Less than a block from where I sit typing this is Haymarket, where
in the early part of this century Union organizers were framed,
then murdered by the police to try to prevent the establishment of
the eight hour workday.</a>
