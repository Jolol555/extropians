Wow.  Hope you guys can do a show and tell at Oshkosh next year.  There is
growing interest in amatuer rocketplanes, and this sounds like a nice
engine, combined with a modern composite airframe, for a lively little
single seat TAV.

Reminds me of a story I read in Analog many years ago, about a Shuttle
pilot who winds up in a parellel universe where the gubmint never got into
rockets and space travel, and it grew up as a hobby/spectator sport.  A
few hundred dead pilots later, the Boy Scouts had there own space station
and Jerry Pournelle was mayor of Luna City.
