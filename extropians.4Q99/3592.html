Lee,

<p>
First of all let me say that you have reminded me of why I almost never
discuss stock trading with people.  But seeing as I jumped in the thread
of my own free will, I guess I will take it one more round.

<p>
The major differences between stock trading as I do it and poker are:

<p>
	If I "bet" wrong and a stock moves counter to the way I wanted it to I
can pull the bet, leaving in only my antee.  For example, on a purchase
of 1000 shares at $30 for 30,000 invested I would drop out if the stock
moved a 16th. or 8th. against me, making my loss $62.50 or $125.00.  For
it to be all or nothing like a poker hand the stock would have to drop
to zero before I got out.

<p>
	I can see most of the other players hand.  If you have ever seen a
level 2 screen it shows in real time the orders waiting on both sides of
the buy or sell, who the buyer/seller is, what they will pay or sell
for, and number of shares in the bid/offer.  

<p>
	When a stock moves with my trade, a small move would be 1/2 point, a
large move can be 4 or 5 points, the average is around 2 points right
now.  This means on average I could be wrong 16 to 32 times to every
correct play and not go in the hole to badly.  Right now my average is
calling a move correctly 8 out of 10 times. And before anyone says it,
yes the market is pretty easy right now and might not always be.

<p>
As for the don't be silly paragraph I hardly know where to begin.

<p>
I am not talking about looking at all the trades everyone has made I am
talking about looking at my trades and my methods to see where my
trading can be improved.  There will always be losing trades, my goal is
to see if I am making the same mistake repeatedly. ie buying on to short
of uptick, stopping out to soon, time of day, volume to price momentum,
etc etc. I do not know the perfect application of every trading method
and I doubt that anyone does which all the more reason to look at the
different methods and see what works best in a given market.  I would
"bet" money that even today the biggest trading houses are still
grinding away at old data looking for new information in it.

<p>
You comment reminds me of people who who think there can't be anything
left to invent with all we have now, or who think they know so much that
there cannot be anything left to learn. ie. Don't you think that if
there were a way to extend our lives that we would have already found it
and no one would die?  Do you think there is no new software that might
find a pattern in large data fields that might be of use? (Does the
phrase data mining ring a bell?) Do you give no weight to the fact that
the computing power available to average people today did not exist at
any price not so long ago?

<p>
I hope I've answered some of your post, I don't mean go on a rant, but
everyone makes the gambling analogy and it is not the same. It has risk
and rewards like all of life, but an intelligent investor can push the
odds so far in his favor that the comparison to gambling is a poor one
as I hope I have touched on here.

<p>
