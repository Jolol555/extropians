<a name="1375qlink1">Well put. I think this is something that is often lacking in our
discussions here, the concern for fellow (trans)humans. Sure, truth is
truth and I think most of us thirst for it and hate when it is
polluted, but that doesn't mean we should hurt people
</a>
unnecessarily. Far too many transhumanists I know want to jump into
the intellectual fray and mercilessly rend stupidity and errors left
and right - but while they may win the debate, they close the doors to
others: they don't convert people, they antagonize them and by
repulsing them from transhumanist or rational ideas make them less
likely to realize their error. Not good. 

<p>
That is why I think it is better to discuss things evenly, to dig down
and find the underlying assumptions *with* the other person, and then
try to see the implications. Often that is much powerful. It can also
be used to study one's *own* beliefs. After all, they ought to be able
to withstand a penetrating analysis too.
