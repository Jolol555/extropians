To all you budding Solipsists out there, I want to make
you aware of the danger you may face in case of:

<p>
[1] an emergency like a a plane crash, a natural<br>
<p>
     disaster that disrupts all logistical systems, a riot;
<br>
[2] a state of total war, probably nuclear, in which all<br>
<p>
     social structures and institutions were destroyed;
<br>
[3] your imprisonment whether innocent or not in<br>
<p>
     many State and most Federal penitentiaries.
<br>
[4] ---------<br>
[5] ---------<br>
<p>
          |
<br>
[N] ---------<br>

<p>
You would immediately become aware that, under
<a name="0712qlink1">these circumstances, many people would subscribe
to your Moral System. You would confront a terrifying
Hobbesian nightmare where, to your paralyzing dismay,
you were the prey in the middle of a circle of relentlessly
advancing human predators, whose prior socialization
enabled them to see the advantage, as wild dogs do,
<a name="0643qlink1">of hunting in packs.</a></a>
