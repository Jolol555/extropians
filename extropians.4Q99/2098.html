Interesting comment.  I would have said that a possible
universe actualized by and within the finite experience
of [N] can no longer be perceived; but that it does matter
insofar as it was communicated and experienced vicariously
by others, thereby perpetuated as memory.

<p>
In this context, "staying alive" means one's continuing
investment in the evolution of a unique ontological vision,
and, as noted by others in this thread, complying with
those ad hoc personal rules that have proven to be of
instrumental value.
