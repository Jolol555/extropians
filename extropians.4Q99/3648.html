the year 0.</a>  The years 0 to 99 would then be called the zeroeth century,
the years 0 to 9 would be the zeroeth decade, and so on, so that we
would be entering the zeroeth year of the second millennium in a three weeks,
and the yahoos need not argue about when the new millennium starts.</a></a>

lessee, is that the 1500s or the 1700s?  Oh yeah, OK.  The 1500s *should*

get over that.  Herod perished in 3 BC by the new reckons.  But it would
be a better, more logical system.  spike
