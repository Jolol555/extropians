<a href="2906.html#2913qlink1">&gt; Sure, people will kill themselves in difficult situations</a><br>
<i>&gt; (and/or because their brains are out of balance), but strictly </i><br>
<i>&gt; speaking this isn't rational, certainly not in this day and age </i><br>
<i>&gt; with its prospect of immortality and sustainable mood enhancement </i><br>
<i>&gt; (among other things).</i><br>

<p>
Sustainable mood enhancement? Should my life's goal be a lobotomy and
a morphine drip? You seem to be advocating a Mario Brothers vision of
meaningful life - stay alive as long as possible so you can keep
jumping for pleasure points. Even positing that this is the only
rational course, why would suicide not be justified if I have good
reason to belive my total score from this point on will be less than
zero - as I belive was the motivation for the hypothetical life
imprisonment scenario?

<p>
And why should the rational course necessarily be determined the simple
summation of all future pleasurable experiences? It seems to me
there's a factor in the sequence which decays over time - I wouldn't
submit to a million years of agony, starting now, even if the
following million were quite nice.

<p>
Pleasure is a good way to pass the time, but being dead doesn't mean
you've lost, it means you've stopped playing the game. Honestly, I
can't imagine anything more horrible than the prospect of living
literally forever.
