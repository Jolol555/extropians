<a href="1478.html#1493qlink1">&gt; I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on a possible "cure" for sleep - a</a><br>
<i>&gt; drug or procedure which will eliminate the need to lay still with your eyes</i><br>
<i>&gt; closed for 8 unproductive hours a day.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as I know, scientists know very little about sleep. We know that REM</i><br>
<i>&gt; sleep is required for mental well being. We know that the body is fine</i><br>
<i>&gt; without sleep but the brain is not, so it's the brain that the attack should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be centered on. The goal would be to understand exactly how sleep effects</i><br>
<i>&gt; the brain, physically, and to replicate these physical changes with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; device, or pill, that works in less then 8 hours.</i><br>

<p>
The problem might be that these changes could be incompatible with
conscious, useful activity. For example, one theory I'm currently
rather fond of is that during deep sleep memory is consolidated by
reinstatement of previous activity patterns due to the hippocampus
(this ties into my memory research). If this is true, then you cannot
use this time to do something else simply because all of your cortex
is being subjected to boring re-runs of the most important things
learned in the day. Maybe the consolidation could be enhanced (sounds
like a great idea, since it could also possibly improve memory), but
eliminating sleep might be too much.

<p>
(note that REM sleep is different; my current view is that it could be
something similar for the basal ganglia and planning/motor
memory. Lucid dreaming does not seem incompatible with it, but I do
not have any data)

<p>
Now, there are people who do not sleep. Apparently some rare cases
where the serotonin system has been damaged suffer from total
insomnia. However, I don't think their mental state is quite normal.
I'm not sure, but I would expect intrusions of sleep-like activity
interspersed with normal activity, likely reducing efficiency and
reasoning.

<p>
The best way of handling sleep is IMHO to set up a sleep schedule that
doesn't interfere with one's projects. I like the idea of biphasic
sleep (a siesta in the early afternoon), while Waldemar Ingdahl is a
proponent of using half an hour of meditation (which IMHO is very
similar to a nap) at that time to reduce the need for sleep during the
night. The trick is to set up a schedule that works with one's
ordinary life.

<p>
As for myself, I would dearly like to be able to control when I need
to sleep. But not get rid of it - I think Endymion is worth envying.

Mortal: So what do you Jupiter brains do all the time?
SI:	We sleep.
<br>
Mortal: You SLEEP?!
<br>
SI:	Sure. We sleep wonderfully.
<br>
Mortal: Aren't you thinking about life, the universe and everything?
<pre>
SI:	Already did. Besides, we dream about it sometimes. 
Mortal:	But why all that brainpower then?
SI:	Do you understand how much capacity it takes to sleep *really* well?

I have written an essay on sleep and sleep control which unfortunately
is in Swedish, it can be found at
