<p>
    When NASA was preparing for the Apollo project, they did some astronaut
  training on a Navajo Indian reservation.
  
<p>
  One day, a Navajo elder and his son were herding sheep and came across the
  space crew. The old man, who spoke only Navajo, asked a question which his
  son translated. "What are these guys in the big suits doing?"
  A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon.
  
<p>
  The old man got all excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon
  with the astronauts.
  
<p>
  Recognizing a promotional opportunity for the spin-doctors, the NASA folks
  found a tape recorder. After the old man recorded his message, they asked
  the son to translate it. He refused.
  
<p>
  So the NASA reps brought the tape to the reservation where the rest of the
  tribe listened and laughed but refused to translate the elder's message to
  the moon.
  
<p>
  Finally, the NASA crew called in an official government translator. He
  reported that the moon message said, "Watch out for these guys; they have
  come to steal your land." &gt;&gt;
