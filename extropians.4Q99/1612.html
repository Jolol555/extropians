              Mars Polar Lander Mission Status
                     October 30, 1999
  
<a name="1651qlink1">     NASA's Mars Polar Lander spacecraft successfully fired its 
</pre>
thrusters for 12 seconds this morning to fine-tune its</a> flight 
path for arrival at the Martian south pole on December 3.  

<p>
     Flight controllers said the spacecraft performed as planned 
and that preliminary data show the desired trajectory change was 
achieved. The thruster firing began at 10:28 a.m. Pacific 
Daylight Time.  Previous thruster firings were accomplished on 
January 21, March 15, and September 1.  The next thruster firing 
is scheduled for November 30.
  
<p>
     The landing site is located at 76 degrees south latitude 
and 195 degrees west longitude, near the northern edge of the 
layered terrain in the vicinity of the Martian south pole.  The 
lander is now about 14.3 million kilometers (about 8.9 million 
miles) from Mars, traveling at a speed of 4.8 kilometers per 
second (about 10,700 miles per hour) relative to Mars.  The 
spacecraft is about 228 million kilometers (about 142 million 
miles) from Earth, and has traveled along an arcing flight path 
of about 690 million kilometers (about 429 million miles) 
through space since launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 
January 3, 1999.

     Mars Polar Lander is managed for NASA's Office of Space 
Science by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  JPL is a division of
