<p>
The recent comments by Damien and Robert on a piece of poetry
unknown to me combined with my current reading (Stephenson's
<br>
"In the beginning Was the Command Line" have got me thinking.<br>

<p>
Stephenson comments on the degree to which modern (esp. American)
entertainment, news, etc. programs people to accept diversity
to the degree that they give up personal culture that dictates
<br>
"rights" and "wrongs".  Now clearly D. &amp; R. who are two of<br>
the most literary people on the list (IMO), seem to have
rejected the pre-programmed mindsets and formed their own
distinct, perhaps culturally specific, interpretations of
literary method known as "bathos".

<p>
Now, offering a comment on the quality of the members of this
list OR perhaps my poor American education OR simply an observation
of how esoteric some of our discussions may become, I will state
that I had never heard of the term "bathos" before today.
Since we may assume I'm not entirely uneducated, I must conclude
that we are discussing highly uncommon topics for the average
individual.

<p>
What is really interesting in my mind is whether or not the
D/R opinions are being driven by some absolute criteria,
or criteria that are culturally specific.

Robert
