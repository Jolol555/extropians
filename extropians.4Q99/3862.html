<p>
I find the ongoing debate on AI purposes, technology and future
extremely interesting and wish to summarize my views on some of the
things that have been said (I receive the daily digest and it is
easier for me to contribute this way).
<br>
Concerning the purpose of AIs and the question why should we build
them, there are so many practical applications. Also, isnt' it like
sex? I mean we do sex because we enjoy it and this is due to hormonal
drives built by evolution to propagate the species. Same applies to
building AIs by replacing hormonal with intellectual drives and
considering AIs as part of the evolution of our own species.
I believe that in a future transhuman world the difference between
humans and AIs will be blurred with no sharp dividing line: humans
augmented with AI constructs, AIs "powered by" uploaded humans, etc.
Perhaps there will be no such things as "pure humans" and "pure AIs".
So I do not think we should fear AIs becoming so smarter than us to
rule the world and maybe killing us as we do with vermin. If we want
to keep the distinction between "pure humans" and "pure AIs", then the
same technologies that can build AIs much smarter than us can also be
used to make ourselves much smarter than we are now.

Cheers
