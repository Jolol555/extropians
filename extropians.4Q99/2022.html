The AP reported the premier showing of Michael McNulty's 
new video "Waco: A New Revelation," which is a follow-up 
to his Emmy-Award winning documentary "Waco: The Rules 
of Engagement." This new documentary, narrated by former 
FBI scientist Frederic Whitehurst, alleges that the 
government placed a shaped-charge bomb on top of the 
concrete room, which blasted a hole through its roof, 
killing the woman and children inside. The bomb theory 
was first proposed by Gordon Novel and evidence for it 
is reviewed at IAN GODDARD'S ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN JOURNAL:

Waco Movie Puts Blame on Feds

<p>
WASHINGTON -- A new film on the 1993 Waco siege
suggests federal agents used an explosive charge 
to blast into the steel-reinforced concrete bunker 
where Branch Davidian women and children died. 

<p>
As evidence, the makers of "Waco: A New Revelation"
present video footage shot after the violent end of 
the siege showing a gaping hole in the bunker's roof. 
The steel rods used to reinforce the concrete were 
bent inward -- apparently, the film's analysts say, 
by a blast that would have been devastating to 
people inside. 

<p>
The movie also contends that cult members were 
pinned down by automatic gunfire as the compound 
was consumed by flames, cutting off their only 
route to safety. 

<p>
The film, produced by Colorado-based MGA Entertainment, 
was previewed Wednesday for reporters and others. 

<p>
The FBI said, as it has for six years, that agents 
fired no shots. 

<p>
"We are aware of no incidents where gunfire emanated 
from any law enforcement source," bureau spokesman 
Bill Carter said. "Our position has not changed." 

<p>
Carter said he was unfamiliar with the allegation 
that a "shape charge" explosive device was detonated 
on the roof of the concrete bunker. He also declined 
comment about the documentary. 

<p>
Fresh controversy over Waco began earlier this year 
after the documentary's main researcher, Michael 
McNulty, discovered a potentially incendiary tear 
gas canister amid the thousands of pounds of evidence 
held in storage lockers. That discovery led FBI and 
Justice Department officials to recant their 
longstanding contention that only non-incendiary 
tear gas was used. 

<p>
The government says its agents played no role in the 
fire or Davidians' death. Cult leader David Koresh 
and some 80 followers perished during the blaze, 
some from the flames, others from gunshot wounds. 

<p>
The documentary, which includes interviews with 
former FBI, CIA and military personnel as well as 
surviving Branch Davidians, also asserts:

  <li>  Because of bugging devices in the compound, the 
FBI was aware of the Davidians' talk of setting the 
place aflame. Bureau officials have long denied that 
they had advance knowledge of the cult members' 
intent, saying the transmissions were too garbled 
to understand. 

  <li>  Federal agents fired from a helicopter at a Branch
Davidian who ventured outside the compound three hours
before the blaze began, according to a videotape 
analyzed by Edward Allard, a former Army night vision 
lab supervisor hired as an expert in the Davidian 
survivors' wrongful-death lawsuit against the 
government. "In our opinion, it's clearly machine 
gun fire from the helicopter," Allard says on the film. 

  <li>  Infrared surveillance videotape shot by an FBI 
plane shows two people rolling out from under a tank 
and firing dozens of rounds from a machine gun at the 
compound, Allard says. "I stopped counting after 62 
individual shots," he says.

Rep. Clifford Stearns, R-Fla., who attended one of 
two film screenings Wednesday, said the documentary 
should be seen by members of Congress and the public 
alike. 

<p>
As to those who might dismiss the film as biased, 
Stearns said: "I don't visualize it as propaganda. 
I visualize it as an attempt to bring questions to 
the American people." 

<p>
The documentary is narrated by Frederic Whitehurst, 
a former FBI scientist whose complaints about shoddy
practices in the bureau's crime lab led to a scathing
inspector general review.
