While sitting here in the delightful  truckstop in the thriving metropolis of 
Albert Turkey New Mexico I have been reading quiet heavily.  How else does 
one pass the time?

<p>
Along with my usual ration of trashy (and ocassionaly NOT trashy) Science 
fiction books I have just completed "Crater of Doom"...which you have to 
admit...has a catchy title.

<p>
It has to do with the K/T boundry extinction and it's causal event....an 
exterrestrial oject's (asteroid &lt;meteor?&gt; or comet) impact with the yucatan 
penn. of mexico.

<p>
I'm sure most members on this list know more about it than i've learned from 
reading the book but i found it interesting.  In it was hinted that there 
might be some connection between the impact and the massive volcanic 
eruptions in india at approximately the same time.

<p>
What was MORE interesting is that I heard much more positive declarations of 
such a connection from a member of this list (Micheal Lowrie....where are you 
anyway....?????....long time no hear from) much earlier.  Of Course the book 
was published in 97 and I just now got around to reading it.

<p>
Micheal said that (my words to describe his explanation) a resonance focusing 
effect of the siesmic shockwaves caused  the volcanic event in india...the 
results of the Impact AND the vulcanism combined contributed to the k/t 
boundry mass extinction.

<p>
Dunno...but it's another reason i'm glad I'm a subscriber to this list..
