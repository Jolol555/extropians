Right, so don't blame the women. (Sorry if it sounds like I am blaming the
men).

<p>

<p>
I agree.  The whole idea of anti population has a very negative anti life
aspect to it.

<p>
Frankly, I think that some women are too stupid to make good mothers.  Stupid
<a name="0819qlink2">women make very poor relationship choices, they have difficulty</a> taking care of
<a name="0819qlink3">themselves, and they neglect their children.</a>

<p>
Part of the problem is that 'neglected' children are often called 'unwanted
children'.  'Unwanted children' are really the neglected offspring of parents
too incompetent to take care of them.

<p>
Give a child to a mother of normal intelligence who swears up and down that she
does want a baby.  And 9 out of 10 of them will raise happy healthy children.

<p>
But you give a child to a mother with an IQ of 80, who thinks that having a kid
is really cool.  And everyone who sees the situation will shake their head and
say 'that poor unwanted child'.
