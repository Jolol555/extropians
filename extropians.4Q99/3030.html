<p>
Well, my problem as well. So I did some rush research:

<p>
[1] BORGANISM: 1) An organization of formerly autonomous beings who
have merged their individual wills to create one, collectively conscious
being; 2) The social and political theory that advocates the creation of
borganisms.

<p>
[2] "Borganism arose on late 20th century Earth as a response to the
widely-held perception that human individuality had become impractical
and unnecessary. Advocates of borganism ("Borganists") initially came
from the ranks of individual humans dissatisfied with their low-bandwidth
connections to other humans.</a> "

<p>
My studied response was -- WHY would anyone want to submerge their
individualities in a collective cyborg?  But a little more investigation has
indicated that Anders has worked this out by having the best of both
worlds.  He confesses:

<p>
<a name="3068qlink1">"I have always wanted to do a lot of things: to learn to write</a> calligraphy
well, to develop huge artificial life simulations/universes, explore the Earth
and the universe, teach and interact with children, compose grand
symphonies, invent better ways to think and perceive the world, cook and
eat delicious food, gather information into useful patterns, dedicate myself
to studies in the occult, medicine, theoretical physics, nanotechnology and...
Obviously I can't do all this..."

<p>
BUT WAIT: "The solution seems to be borganisation. If I could create/
become a copy-clan where each individual was an individual derived from me,
and at the same time was linked into a kind of collective consciousness
where skills, experiences and ideas could flow freely, then I could do
everything (well, almost everything; I would have to wait for the Far Edge
Party..."

<p>
Naturally, many questions arise, like WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? all apart from
obscure details like "Far Edge Party" and "copy clan" etc. But I'm sure there
must be some explanation; perhaps I will check out <a href="http://www.tgd.org/acf/">http://www.tgd.org/acf/</a>,
the Official Headquarters of the The Aleister Crowley Foundation. You must
start somewhere, after all. If all else fails, we could ask Anders.
