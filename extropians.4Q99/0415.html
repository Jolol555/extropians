 &lt;&lt;Posthumanity transcends belief, or it remains human. The concepts of 
"should"
<br>
 and "improvement" belong to the world of human perception.&gt;&gt;

<p>
This statement, if I understand it properly, seems to assume that the 
concepts of belief and improvement are exclusively human.  I do not think 
this to be necessarily true.  I think these concepts could be part of the 
worldview of different sentient beings, and may continue into posthumanity 
(or at least some branches thereof).  I do not think that it is necessary to 
reject all that is human to become posthuman.  However, I acknowledge the 
possibility that I may be wrong.  It is my hope to discover the answer 
personally.

<p>
&lt;&lt; Transhumanity leaves all this behind. Benevolence, responsibility, and all <br>
other facets of the meme-bound mind evaporate in the pure coherence of that 
which replaces it with unknowable purity. The timeless and inexhaustible  
unifying physical principles underlying the ground of being surpass anything 
now imaginable by humans. &lt;burp&gt;&gt;
 
<p>
I happen to value my memes and my mind; I revel in the self.  I do not 
believe that these and the "physical principles underlying the ground of  
being" are mutually exclusive.  I do not seek purity, but heterogeneity, ever 
growing expanding becoming.  I do not think that Transhumanity requires I 
leave behind who I have been, but rather that I build upon it.

<p>
  &lt;&lt;Choice itself prevents complete integration with reality. When you do not 
choose
<br>
 at all, then reality displaces choice, then you and reality coincide.&gt;&gt;
 
<p>
Aren't I already integrated with reality?  I am a facet of reality which 
chooses.  Now who's being dualistic?  Maybe I do not fully understand, but 
that doesn't make me any less integrated with reality.

<p>
 &lt;&lt;Unavoidably, planning prevents one from transcending desire, because a 
plan has
<br>
 a goal, and consequently it comes out of desire. Moralism and dualism 
separate
<br>
 you from direct experience of reality.&gt;&gt;

<p>
I agree, plans come from goals, and goals come from desire.  I am uncertain 
of whether moralism and dualism separate one from a direct experience of 
reality.  If so, I do not need to have a direct experience, and will make do 
with an indirect one.  

<p>
<a href="0307.html#0415qlink1">&lt;&lt; The desire to do good, IOW good intentions, as every conscientious student </a><br>
of ethics learns, often leads to unintended consequences.&gt;&gt;

<p>
Very true, but you only state a subset of the truth.  All intentions of a 
less than omniscient, omnipotent being will have unintended consequences, as 
a limited being will not be able to predict all of the causal cascade of any 
event.  However, in the absense of intention, all consequences are 
unintended.  The question is whether one has intentions or not.  I have 
desires which lead to intentions, and will try to maximize the occurrence of 
good consequences, and limit the occurrence of evil consequences (since my 
intention is to increase good and decrease evil, in general evil consequences 
are unintended).  Yes, my actions will have both good and evil consequences; 
I accept this fact.

<p>
<a href="0307.html#0415qlink2">&lt;&lt; Nevertheless, if one knows enough to recognize the biological basis of </a><br>
morality, as Richard Dawkins has expertly explained it, one can simply do 
what feels right, with the confidence that countless generations of evolution 
have refined this feeling to match your species' best interests in evolving 
to higher understanding via more complex adaptive systems (organisms).&gt;&gt;

<p>
Funny, I always thought evolution was refining methods to pass on genetic 
information.  As for doing what feels right due to it being the result of 
countless generations; I always pay close attention to what feels right, but 
I do not let it rule me.  I agree there is hard won wisdom there, but it is 
not perfect, and must be weighed on the scales of reason.  And remember, what 
is in my species best interests is not always in my best interests, or even 
in the best interests of life in general.

<p>
<a href="0307.html#0415qlink3">&lt;&lt;  As I pause to look out the window, and imagine how these words will </a><br>
register with you, it occurs to me that you already know all this, and that 
this conversation merely serves to signal our mutual understanding by using 
English as a device of re-affirmation. The most important things in life, we 
always figure out for ourselves. Language allows us to know that others have 
the same ability.&gt;&gt;
 
<p>
I suspect that I do not have the same understanding as you, or at least we 
externally manifest it differently.  I have purposely worded my responses in 
a egocentric manner for that is what I believe, and that is who I am.  To do 
otherwise would be dishonest.  

<p>
Yet, I have often wondered if the paths of desire and of no desire do not 
merge somewhere on the far horizon....well, I will continue on my path and 
see where it leads.

<p>
 &lt;&lt; Namaste, I honor the manifestation of knowledge in you.
 &lt;gets up to go for a walk in the morning sunshine&gt; &gt;&gt;

<p>
Thank you.  May your walk be a good one.
