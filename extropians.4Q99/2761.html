In a message dated 99-11-29 10:01:52 EST, you write:

would
<br>
 they not just eliminate it's influence in some way ? &gt;&gt;

<p>
In moderation, the ability to be bored is often quite adaptive; it motivates 
you to seek novelty and change, which in turn can lead to new discoveries of 
importance to the maintenance of the organism/system.  If the SI's reach a 
point where they seem able to model beforehand everything they are 
discovering through exploration, then it would be likely that they would 
calibrate themselves to have a very high tolerance for repitition (and thus 
not get bored easily), but to compensate they should have a very low 
threshold for curiosity...anything remotely unexpected should make them 
intensely curious.  This way they won't be so mellow as to miss something 
important, but not so restless as to make life intolerable.
