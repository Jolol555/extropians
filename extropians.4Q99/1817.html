Yah the  "all sinners" concept is a bad concept. It seems to be almost 
exclusively a Church concept, as in Council of Nicea 315, and 325CE.  The 
Aztecs didn't care whether one was a 'sinner' as it was a 'glory' to be 
sacrificed to the Great Black Jaguar in the Sky-no sin involved. They also 
murdered captured prisoners from smaller tribes, and cut out their hearts 
regardless of moral status.
