Since I first learned drafting on "the board" in Junior High School (in
<a name="3646qlink1">1979) and I grew up with my father bringing home drawings from work to
show me, I KNOW I can do my job with out a computer. In fact I own a very
nice drafting table and I kept all my drafting equipment from my first
drafting job, which went from manual drafting to CAD system use.</a> Six
years of drafting education and twelve years of experience (using CAD as
well as manual drafting) have shown me that the high tech way isn't
necessarilly faster, just more accurate and it keeps everyone's work
looking consistent.

<p>
Besides I just need a portable generator and I can run my CAD system at
home (on my PC) and get plenty done. Either way I'm set since I mostly
used my drafting table to do calligraphy and illumination for awards
given out in the SCA.... So if the clocks get set back because of
whatever madness grips the world (Yeah...right) I can still find work
documenting the downfall of modern man in some post-apoclyptic Book of
Hours or whatever.
