Being a newcomer, I always look for posts like yours to provide insight
into the motivation of members of a movement, and where the group
is actually at with reference to the practical application of its Ideology.

<p>

<a name="0593qlink1">What your statement suggests to me is [1] a feeling of impatience with
the groups actual progress;</a> [2] a rather telling admission that so far
the group has not discovered<a name="0593qlink2"> any practical way of implementing its

program.

<p>
It's a crucial question to ask now that the "Myth of Progress" has become
a pervasive cultural icon: is human progress possible?

I am certainly NOT attempting to identify Pindar's limits; but I do know
that "infinity" is a useful mathematical fiction, rather like zero. They are
features of abstract systems of notation, but like /-1 can never exist
<a name="0593qlink6">in the way we do.  The boundary situation is there, the hard edge.
