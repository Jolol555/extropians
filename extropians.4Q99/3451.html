<p>
There was a (brief) article in New Scientist a couple of years ago ('96, maybe
<br>
'97) about some suggestion that homosexuality would be beneficial in that the<br>
male without offspring would donate his resources to his sister's offspring (as
there is a higher certainty of them being related than brother's offspring).
They were backing this up with some data showing a higher than random
correlation between homosexual males and maternal uncles who were homosexual
males.  My memory is sketchy but i remember there wasn't that much detail given
in the article either (one of those in the 'This week' section at the front).
