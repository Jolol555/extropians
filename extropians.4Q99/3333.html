o Overcoming Paralysis: A computerized implant helps move a paralyzed
arm...

<p>

<pre>
                          Spinal cord injuries are often caused by car
accidents or bad falls.
                          They can happen in a split second, yet the
paralysis these injuries
                          cause can last a lifetime. At least, that's
</pre>
the way it used to be.

<pre>
                          Eating out is much more than a treat for
22-year-old Shawn Reed
                          and his fiancée, Kim Faust. It's a triumph.
Shawn says, "We get
                          along good. I think we're gonna have a good
</pre>
life together."

<pre>
                          Two years ago, Shawn was left paralyzed from
</pre>
the chest down
<p>
   after a car accident. Most people thought he'd never use his hands
again. They were wrong. He
<p>
   can use his right hand today with the help of a computerized device
inside his arm. It's called the
<p>
   "NeuroControl Freehand System."

<p>
   David Ruch, M.D., a hand surgeon at Wake Forest University Baptist
Medical Center in
<p>
   Winston-Salem, N.C., says, "It takes someone who has no use in their
upper extremities -- they
<p>
   can't care for themselves, they can't comb their hair, they can't
feed themselves -- and gives them
<p>
   independence."

<p>
   Surgeons at Wake Forest attached computer-controlled
   electrodes to eight of Shawn's arm muscles. The electrodes make
   the muscles contract so his hand can open and close. Shawn
   activates the electrodes by moving his left shoulder. Weekly visits
   to a hospital therapist help fine tune his movements.

<pre>
                          "I'm just gonna see if I'm gonna let it
                          beat me or I'm gonna beat it, and I
                          feel like I'm beating it," says Shawn.
Mastering the Freehand does
                          take patience and determination. Shawn has
</pre>
both.

<pre>
                          The Freehand is used by about 150 people
worldwide. Right now,
                          it's FDA-approved for paralyzed people who can
still move their
                          shoulders. Dr. Ruch predicts it will
</pre>
eventually be approved for use
<p>
   in people who can only move their necks or mouths, like Christopher
Reeve, and that one day it
<p>
   will be used in the legs.
