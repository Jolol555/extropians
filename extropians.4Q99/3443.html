<p>
That would depend on the values of who/what did the simulation,
soemthing we cannot predict or estimate well. Given the ability to
recreate history and relative simplicity of just running an upload, it
seems that it would be very cheap for the simulator to upload
everybody, so if there are any limitations on who gets uploaded, it is
purely due to the preferences of the simulator.

<p>
Then there is a question of when to make the upload snapshot. Maybe it
would be better to make snapshots at several ages, so that you could
get both the brilliant young genius, the mature scientist, the wise
old man and the Alzheimer patient (with everything in between) without
having to make an arbitrary choice for one of them.
