<p>
In what I've read of yours, you've mentioned that you think that an
undeniable proof of your own consciousness/qualia/feeling of self is
readily apparent to you.

<p>
It seems to me that, if it is at least CONCEPTUALLY possible that you
might be a zombie, then your proof fails.  You could "think" you were
conscious, but not actually BE conscious.  (At least, you could "think" so
in the same way that the zombie thinks, so you might not want to call this
"thinking," though a functionalist would.)

<p>
Similarly, I take it that the only reason anybody accepts the idea of
qualia is that they believe they have a similar proof, undeniable and yet
accessible only to themselves, that they have qualia.  My thought
experiment was an attempt to cast doubt on that sort of "proof."

<p>
If that "proof" is doubtful, then we have a Very Good Reason to throw out
qualia/consciousness altogether: they don't fit in with the rest of what
we "know" about the world, and they don't explain anything else, so
Occam's Razor says to drop it unless and until we have some clear evidence
that they do exist.
