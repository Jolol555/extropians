<a name="3116qlink1">I was thinking more along the lines of individuals respecting individuals.
It takes very strong motivations (starvation or lack of mates) or a lot
of other+self convincing that you have a well defined advantage (so
you are "likely" to get the spoils you are risking your life for)
to put humans into a mode where they become violent towards other
humans.  One on one the risks of self injury are usually too high unless,
as you point out, one side has a significant technology edge.</a>

<a name="3116qlink2"><a name="3110qlink1">Once an individual or group gets a distinct technology or numbers
advantage, then yes, we do seem to have a bad habit of falling
back on violence.</a>  Presumably latent drives for food or mates
coming to the surface.  Interesting isn't it how few women you
you see going on rampaging killing sprees or becoming power
hungry dictators....
