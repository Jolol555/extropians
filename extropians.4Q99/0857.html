I think I have to go along with den Otter on this one.  When I want to
reproduce, I'll clone myself or build an AI.  If I need geniuses, the
only way I'm going to get them in time is to find them as five- or
ten-year-olds and train 'em up.  There's still a possibility that an
infant born right now could play a role in the Singularity, but it'd
have to be one heck of an infant - a neurohack or something.  It would
take a true genius, not just a very bright kid, and my impression is
that genius isn't something you can reliably get by breeding two
geniuses together.  Sexual recombination isn't going to cut it.  Cloning
Nobel Prize winners and raising them in an enriched environment might be
more interesting.
