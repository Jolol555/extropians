<i>&gt; variety of insects and microorganisms that are essential to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; survival of said plants, but you don't need a complete ecosystem.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As long as you can maintain the system in a stable state with a</i><br>

<a name="2232qlink1"><a name="2223qlink1">Again, if it's going to be functioning in space, with a closed
boundary, with living organisms in it, then it *is* a complete
ecosystem. The question is not whether or not you need a
complete ecosystem, the question is whether the ecosystem you
construct will flourish or die.

<p>
<a name="2232qlink2"><a name="2223qlink2">The system you describe, a closed system with just a few
species, has actually been attempted in early closure
experiments. It proved, empirically, unstable. So I don't know
why you feel that we already know how to do this when past
attempts to do so have failed.

<p>
<a href="2133.html#2192qlink2">&gt; The "Biosphere" approach, in contrast, requires that you create a</a><br>
<i>&gt; completely self-sustaining ecology.  You end up with at least an</i><br>
<i>&gt; order of magnitude increase in the number of species involved, lots</i><br>
<i>&gt; of extra biomass, and an unmanageable mess of interlocking feedback</i><br>
<i>&gt; loops that are almost impossible to manage.  Making it work at all</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be far more difficult than in the agriculture approach, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; making it produce food with any reasonable efficiency will be nearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2223qlink3">Perhaps you should familiarize yourself with the history of the
research. The early closures all *failed* at some point and had
to be opened. The current complex approach which you dismiss
developed in response to an exploration of those failures and
successful attempts to remedy them.

after six months or so, but I have other plans.
