While browsing around the web I found this quote.

<p>
"When I became convinced that the universe is natural, that all the ghosts 
and gods are myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul, into every 
drop of my blood the sense, the feeling, the joy of freedom. The walls of my 
prison crumbled and fell. The dungeon was flooded with light and all the 
bolts and bars and manacles became dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf, 
or a slave. There was for me no master inall the wide world, not even in 
infinite space. I was free--free to think, to express my thoughts--free to 
live my own ideal, free to live for myself and those I loved, free to use 
all my faculties, all my senses, free to spread imagination's wings, free to 
investigate, to guess and dream and hope, free to judge and determine for 
myself...I was free! I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously faced all 
worlds.", Robert G. Ingersoll.

<p>
Hope it makes your day.
