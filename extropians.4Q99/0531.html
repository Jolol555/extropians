parents love for the child or their social responsibility to the child, it
is often the case that parents cannot afford what they think is best.
However, perhaps it is possible to make education an investment that has a
financial reward rather than one of love and/or prestige.

Yes, and the problem is that most people can only accept a financial benefit
for their investment, they cannot afford to give their children everything
they would want to give them.  But if it is true that better education would
mean a more successful and wealthy child then there is a financial benefit
to be had from the child, and the parent (or sponsor) should expect a return
on their investment.  This would also mean that those people who do not feel
the natural urge to care for their children have a financial incentive to
offer them the best education and welfare possible.
