<a href="0170.html#0289qlink1">&lt;&lt; Indeed, as you say, power may magnify and amplify attributes. But from </a><br>
whence comes corruption, and why should not humans become transhumans in 
proportion as they transcend the corruptible influence of genetics and 
carbon-based biology?  IOW, genuine transhumanism can mean overcoming the 
desire for power, or for anything else. The thoroughly extropic demi-god does 
not eat galaxies out of lust for power, but rather out of need for the power 
of galaxies to sustain the humble hermitage which contains trillions and 
trillions of tranquilly creative transhumans.&gt;&gt;
 
<p>
<a name="0307qlink1">     Personally, I believe that the road to posthumanity should be as much 
about improving my character as improving my abilities.  I don't know if 
corruption lies in only genetics and carbon-based biology, but I do believe 
that consciously choosing who I will become can lead to a more benevolent me. 
 With increasing power comes increasing responsibility; I have tried to 
deeply incorporate this meme into my personal meme ecology, and believe that 
for the sake of the future we all should.</a>

<p>
<a href="0170.html#0289qlink2">&lt;&lt;The co-worker who becomes a jerk boss always (secretly) wanted to become a </a><br>
jerk boss. The seed of power-abuse must already reside in the abuser. Power 
only
<br>
 provides the opportunity for latent attributes to emerge and grow, it does 
not
<br>
 insinuate any value of its own.&gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="0307qlink2">     Depending on the situation, it may also be true that with the increase 
in power there could be an increase in temptation and oftentimes an increase 
in stress which might lead one to corruption, so in that way power could 
influence character.  But I do not believe power to only be a force for 
corruption; for where some stumble and fall, others may rise to the occassion 
and become more than they once were.  A jerky coworker upon becoming the boss 
may realize that what once were relatively harmless foibles now can truly 
ruin people's lives, and may decide to straighten up and do better.  I 
suppose we could call this gaining maturity.  Coming to understanding of our 
true power to affect lives and consciously taking responsibility for that 
power will go a long way to avoiding corruption, as will a realization of the 
possibilty of our own falibility&lt;sp?&gt;.

<a href="0170.html#0289qlink3">&lt;&lt;If you had a window into the mind of a sleeping saint, you'd see the dreams </a><br>
of a
<br>
 criminal. Culture does not consist in geography. Algebra works the same in 
the
<br>
 East as it does in the West. "Art is Art, water is    water, East is East and
 West is West. And if you take cranberries and stew them up with applesauce 
they
<br>
 taste more like prunes than rhubarb does... Now you tell me what _you_
 know." --Groucho Marx&gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="0307qlink3">    I certainly agree with that first line.  In general, I am considered a 
good person, but I have had plenty of random thoughts that were completely 
evil.  So what makes me still a good person?</a>  I choose to claim the good 
<a name="0307qlink4">thoughts as my path, and though I embrace the reality that I am capable of 
evil, I choose to leave those thoughts behind me.</a>
 
<p>
 &lt;&lt;Power cannot corrupt anything, because, as Glen pointed out, it only 
magnifies
<br>
 what already exists. What does this say about transhumanists who transcend
 desire? It says that only choicelessly aware transhumanists shall discover 
the
<br>
 way to that which abides ineffably. It says that in order to stride amongst 
the
<br>
 stars forever, you will return to the place where you began, and know it for 
the
<br>
 first time. Only stories have beginnings and endings. Reality has no 
beginning
<br>
 and no end. &lt;burp&gt;&gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="0307qlink5">     I do not plan to transcend desire, but rather to refine it.  I believe 
that desire is what gives the universe moral worth.  But not all desires are 
created equal, so I will desire to have good desires, and to gain the power 
to fulfil the desire to do good.  But to do good, one needs to have an ever 
refined and expanded understanding of reality, so I agree, we will return to 
the place where we began, and know it truly.  But then we will continue, 
growing ever onward from that base.</a>
