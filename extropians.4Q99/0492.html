GALILEO SPACECRAFT HAS HOT DATE WITH VOLCANIC MOON

<p>
     NASA's Galileo spacecraft is gearing up for a daring 
rendezvous with Jupiter's moon Io (pronounced EYE-oh), the most 
volcanic body in our solar system, on Sunday night, Oct. 10 
(Pacific Time). 

<p>
     Galileo will swoop down to within 612 kilometers (380 miles) 
of  Io's fiery surface at 10:06 p.m. PDT (1:06 a.m. Oct. 11 EDT), 
snapping the closest-ever pictures of this intriguing celestial 
body.

<p>
     "Io is a natural laboratory for volcanoes," said Dr. Duane 
Bindschadler, Galileo manager of science operations and planning.  
<br>
"By studying Io close up, we'll learn more about how and when <br>
volcanoes erupt and why they act the way they do.  This may even 
help us predict the behavior of volcanoes on Earth."

<p>
     During the flyby, Galileo's science instruments will study 
the chemistry, heat distribution, gravity and magnetic properties 
of Io.  For scientists, this thrilling encounter promises to 
yield a bonanza of pictures and information, but for Galileo 
engineers, the flyby presents a serious challenge with uncertain 
results.  Io's orbit lies in a region of intense radiation from 
Jupiter's radiation belts, which could affect the performance of 
spacecraft systems or even knock out various spacecraft 
instruments.  A mere fraction of the dose that Galileo will 
receive would be fatal to a human.  

<p>
     "We expect that the spacecraft will survive the flyby, 
although the radiation may cause its computers to reset or may 
even cause irreversible damage to critical electronic 
components," said Wayne Sible, Galileo deputy project manager.  
<br>
"There is a possibility, if enough damage is done to the <br>
electronics, it won't survive the flyby.  Because of this 
possibility, we planned the Io encounters for the end of the twoyear
 extended mission. After orbiting Jupiter for nearly four 
years, the spacecraft has more than fulfilled its mission 
objectives, so it seems reasonable to take a calculated risk for 
a much closer look at such a scientifically rich target."

<p>
     Galileo was originally assigned to spend two years studying 
Jupiter, its moons and its magnetic environment.  When that 
original mission ended in December 1997, it was followed by a 
two-year extended mission, scheduled to end in January 2000.  
While spending the past four years near Jupiter, Galileo has been 
exposed to radiation on an ongoing basis, which has caused some 
of its instruments to act up.  

<p>
     To prepare for any possible harm caused by radiation during 
the Io flyby, engineers have designed sophisticated software to 
help the spacecraft weed out a true crisis from a minor glitch 
caused by radiation and respond appropriately.

<p>
     Galileo, the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, has 
revolutionized our knowledge of Jupiter and its moons and has 
provided thousands of colorful images.  Data from Galileo support 
the premise of a liquid ocean beneath the icy crust of Jupiter's 
moon Europa, an intriguing prospect since water is a vital 
ingredient for life.  Thanks to information sent by Galileo, 
scientists know much more about the weather on Jupiter and the 
composition of its moons.  En route to Jupiter, the spacecraft 
took the first-ever close-up pictures of asteroids, when it 
photographed Gaspra and Ida, and it returned historic images of 
the destruction of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 as its pieces slammed 
into Jupiter.

<p>
     If all goes well with the upcoming Io flyby, the spacecraft 
will make an even more daring approach of Io on Nov. 26 at an 
altitude of only 300 kilometers (186 miles).

     Galileo was launched from the Space Shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 
18, 1989.  It entered orbit around Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995.  The 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) manages the Galileo mission for 
NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.  JPL is operated 
for NASA by the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.
