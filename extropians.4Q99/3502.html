Unravel Ribosomal Structure.
<br>
The structure of the small ribosomal subunit has been determinded at the
highest resolution ever achieved by a team of Weizmann Institute and Max
Planck Society scientists. Their findings, aided by the unique utilization
of functional probes, have unraveled key ribosomal features including the
site where protein biosynthesis begins.

to begin collecting DNA samples from Iceland's 270,000 citizens and linking

genetic links to disease - and an unprecedented danger to privacy, doctors
and researchers attending a packed meeting of the American Society of

*Data derived from a balloon-borne probe of the early Universe provides<br>
strong evidence that the Universe is flat and not open.  The data is also

to fill the universe, is helping drive the never-ending expansion of the
Universe. (Dec 7, 99)

come the super pigs. Medical researchers using gene therapy have figured out
a way to make young hogs grow 40 percent larger and faster. Scientists say

would be a boon for livestock farmers — and eventually could even be used to
treat children with growth problems and to prevent muscle deterioration in
AIDS and cancer patients. (MSNBC Dec 7,99)

*Quantum gravity presents the ultimate challenge to theorists. Physics in<br>
the 20th century is founded on the twin pillars of quantum mechanics and the
theory of relativity. However, in spite of the enormous successes of each
theory individually, the two appear to be incompatible. This embarrassing
contradiction at the very heart of theoretical physics remains one of the
great outstanding challenges in science. (Physics Web Dec 99)

extra dimensions look as easy as getting on the subway, but physicists have

infinite dimensions, yet the extra dimensions might be essentially
imperceptible. (Physical Review Focus Dec 2,99)

could be used to create novel silicon-on-insulator structures.

*Structure of Molecular Scissors Critical for the Shaping of Cells Revealed<br>
by Structural Biologists at The Salk Institute. The living cell is the
prototypical shape-shifter. At any given moment, it will reorganize itself
to move, grow, replicate and even die.To achieve its Gumby-like existence,
the cell's internal protein scaffolding, its cytoskeleton, is split apart
and put back together ... over and over again. Until recently, little was
known about how this basic life process was accomplished on the molecular
level. But now scientists at The Salk Institute have shown in
three-dimensional detail how remodeling begins in one of the most prevalent
of these cytoskeletal proteins, called actin. (Dec 2, 99)

source for cells now available only from human bone marrow. (12/6/99)

*So I'm happy to pass on the findings of a report on likely developments in<br>
health care over the next decade, HealthCast 2010, prepared by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the chartered accountants and management
consultants. It's an international study, based on interviews with 400
''thought leaders'' and health care executives in many developed countries,
including Australia. Most attempts to peer into the future of healthcare
emphasise the effects of aging and the growing cost of medical technology.
But this report highlights three other forces of change: more demanding
consumers, the impact of the information revolution, and the way
''genomics'' will shift health care from cure to prevention. (SMH)
