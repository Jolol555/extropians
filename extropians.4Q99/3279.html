There is some substance behind it, though. For example, people with
accounts on JANET (the UK's Joint Academic NETwork) are charged per unit
transferred for data from outside the UK (that isn't cached by JANET's
mondo-huge web caches). This has horrible effects if some spod in the
'States decides to smurf an impecunious student in a hall of residence
at a UK university, who then has to prove that the intercontinental
network storm was nothing to do with them ...
