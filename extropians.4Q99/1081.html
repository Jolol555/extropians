<p>
The part that caught my eye was:

<p>
&gt;&gt;Chromos is also working on human artificial chromosomes for use in
&gt;&gt;conventional, non-germline gene therapy.

<p>
Sounds like somatic cell therapy to me.  Granted, they are working on
engineered animals for protein production, certainly a more near-term (if
you will pardon the expression) "cash cow" than human therapy.

<p>
<a href="1068.html#1081qlink2">&gt; The fundamental problem with whole chromosome approaches is that</a><br>

<p>
Yep, that's a tough one. 

<p>
<a href="1068.html#1081qlink3">&gt; Richard Simmons is lying on the operating table.  The cameras</a><br>

<p>
Hey!  Richard's from my home town.  I've met him.  Nice guy, treats his
mother well. Just glad he lost those red-white-blue shorts. :)

<p>
Somehow, I think Chromos probably has some other approach in mind.
 
<p>
<a href="1068.html#1081qlink4">&gt; I think there are ways around this problem but the engineering</a><br>

<p>
They never are, are they?  For the really good stuff, anyhow.

<p>
The only downer in the release was:

<pre>
&gt;&gt;But the company says it won't let its technology be used for human
&gt;&gt;germline engineering.  "We are in control of the technology, and we
&gt;&gt;don't want to engage in germline gene therapy," stresses Utterson.  

</pre>
<p>
Wimps.  Fortunately, they aren't the only ones working in this field.
