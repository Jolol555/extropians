<a name="2720qlink1">Yes you do; you stated in the original post, regarding
Eliezer's AI-will-save-us scenario, that "The notion sounded 
absurd to me at first". There you have it, that was your
common sense talking, your rational instinct for selfpreservation.
 Only later did your vision get blurred by
Eliezer's relentless smooth talk, which apparently
manages to obscure the simple fact that he cares
about the Singularity and the Singularity alone. When
it really comes down to it you are expendable to him.
He'll "leave you suckers to burn", as he so eloquently
put it.

Hmmm, would it really be that easy to escape earth's 
gravity well &amp; atmosphere? It would take one helluva
meteorite to do that, IMO, and those are rather rare.
<a name="2713qlink1">Even then the nanites would just drift around, not really
doing much. In the meantime we'd be working hard on 
uploading etc.in our Martian (or whatever) base.

<p>
Nanites are only (truly) dangerous when controlled by
an intelligence. As long as that intelligence is merely
human, we have a fighting chance. Fight nanites with
nanites, incinerate them with nukes, take out their
operators, run from them at the highest achievable
% of lightspeed, fool their sensors (with infiltrator 
nanites, for example) etc. A reasonably fair fight. 
When fighting an ASI with nano (and JHWH knows 
what other) powers, on the other hand,  the odds are 
*badly* against you.
