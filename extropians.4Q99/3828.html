I admit it!  I lacked imagination.  {8-[   Ed Regis writes of a much more
exciting experiment with chickens in a centrifuge, thus the title of his
wonderfully entertaining volume: the Great Mambo Chicken.  Of course,
the guppy experiment predated Regis' book, and was done with zero
government funding, on a weekend, without the knowledge of my
superiors.

<p>
Well, actually no.  Never had one while I was there.

Um, yes, I do wish to maintain my clearance.  I hope the security

<p>
Hey, speaking of calling ourselves extropian, Amara Graps is in town
this week, and a bunch of us are going out tomorrow night at
Fumiyoshi's, 1991 W. El  Camino Real in Mt. View.  If you get
in your Volvo and make the scene, your sushi in on me.  {8-]  spike
