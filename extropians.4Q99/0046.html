I thought this was worth forwarding to the list.

George Carlin's Paradox: The paradox of our time in history is that we have
<a name="0049qlink1">taller buildings, but shorter tempers;</a> wider freeways, but narrower
viewpoints. We spend more, but have less; we buy more, but enjoy it less. We
have bigger houses and smaller families; more conveniences, but less time;
we have more degrees, but less sense; more knowledge, but less judgment;
more experts, but more problems; more medicine, but less wellness. We drink
too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too
fast, get too angry too quickly, stay up too late, get up too tired, read
too seldom, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our
possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and
hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've
added years to life, not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon
and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor.
We've conquered outer space, but not inner space. We've done larger things,
but not better things. We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.
We've split the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less.
We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait.
We build more computers to hold more information to produce more copies than
ever, but have less communication. These are the times of fast foods and
slow digestion; tall men, and short character; steep profits, and shallow
relationships. These are the times of world peace, but domestic warfare;
more leisure, but less fun; more kinds of food, but less nutrition. These
are days of two incomes, but more divorce; of fancier houses, but broken
homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throw-away
morality, one-night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything
from cheer to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the show
window and nothing in the stockroom; a time when technology can bring this
letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight .
. .or to just hit delete.

<p>
			Best, Jeff Davis
