Make no mistake here, folks.  If Greenpeace has gotten itself
involved in acitivities opposing genetically-altered foodstuffs,
then those supporting genetic technologies now face some of the
most determined and highly-trained activists on the planet. They
send their people into the woods for a direct-action boot camp, 
and train them to develop a single-minded focus on the task at
hand.  They train their people in media advocacy as well.  They also tend to hire very intelligent people, many of whom have graduate
degrees.  Anyone trained by Greenpeace is in demand to help train
other activist groups.

I, frankly, think that they are wiping the floor with us at this
point in the realm of public opinion.  Having studied, trained and worked with some of these individuals, I would say that we are completely outclassed in trying to face them in any activist situation.  In the realm of media advocacy, however,
we do have a fighting chance, and I hope that people will take the
time to find a media training at their university, in their 
corporation, or community.  We have *got* to step out of our own
circles and start getting our messages out the general public.
