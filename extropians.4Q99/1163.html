You got it right in the ballpark!  Alaska has 1,518,801 square kilometers of 
land or looking at it the other way 586,412 square miles.

<p>
You should be working for the state of Alaska tourism department.  I could 
just imagine your ad campaign, "Come to Alaska, the BIIIG-ASSED state!"  You 
could hire comic actor Martin Lawrence to be the person in the commercials 
saying it!

<p>
Just please don't start accusing Alaskan women of being biiig-assed because 
they are very sensitive about such things.  We have a huge number of gyms in 
town to deal with this modern-day calamity.  But to quote Sir Mix-a-lot, a 
great American songwriter, "But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her 
Honda!"  How did I ever wind up on this subject??  Anyway, I got you the 
info you asked for.


<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
