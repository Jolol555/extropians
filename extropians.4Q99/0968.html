One hears, from time to time, the annoying sentiments that if there were 
a nuclear war, the speaker would prefer to be at ground zero.  That the
living would envy the dead.  

<p>
(The latter statement is especially inane, since the living always
have the option of joining the dead.)

<p>
As far as I can tell, from my days researching such things, life after
massive US/Russian attacks would not be fun.  It would be relatively
short and hard.  And in many ways no different than how a large 
percentage of humanity lives now.  And how all our ancestors lived
until very recently.

<p>
Last I heard, the evidence was against nuclear winter.  The original
studies which were trumpeted by both activists and the press used too
simple a model.  When LLNL's atmospheric studies group used a more
sophisticated model, they found a fraction of the consequences that
Sagan et al had reported.
