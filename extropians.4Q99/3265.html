<a name="3281qlink3">Your comment, Damien, is neither tasteful, nor literate, nor amusing;</a>
I can only regard this as an unfortunate lapse -- it is certainly not
worthy of you. There is an enormous difference between criticism and
ridicule, and this difference is important when something as intimate
and delicate as poetic sensitivity is concerned.

<p>
<a name="3281qlink4">Allow me to tell you something about Henry Vaughan [1622-1695].</a> He,
along with Thomas Carew, Abraham Cowley, Richard Crashaw, John Donne,
George Herbert, Andrew Marvell, John Milton, Thomas Traherne are called
by those familiar with English literature "The Metaphysical Poets"

<p>
Vaughan's work, typical of this genre,  is a blend of emotion and intellectual
ingenuity, characterized by the sometimes Heraclitean combination of ideas
that are not only apprarently disconnected but tend to clash violently. The
idea is to startle the reader and force s/he to think through the argument 
of the poem. Metaphysical poetry is less concerned with expressing feeling 
than with analyzing it, with the poet introspectively exploring the margins 
of consciousness

<p>
This tradition really began with Dante's "Vita Nuova" and from the beginning
was visionary and contemplative. It has exerted enormous influence on
subsequent poetry starting with Pope's Rape of the Lock, and Wordsworth's
"Immortality Ode", and most recently the work of Gerard Manley Hopkins,
D.H.Lawrence, and T.S. Eliot.

<p>
T.S. Eliot's influential essay "The Metaphysical Poets" (1921) pointed out
that the works of these men embody a fusion of thought and feeling that
later poets were unable to achieve because of a "dissociation of sensibility,"
which resulted in works that were either intellectual or emotional but not
both at once.

<p>
<a name="3281qlink5">Finally, "bathos" is hardly a "crime"; it is a perfectly legitimate literary
device.</a> It originated in Classical Greek Drama as a sudden appearance
of the commonplace in an otherwise elevated or refined situation.

<p>
To close, let me emphasize that I have the greatest respect for you,
Damien, and was<a name="3281qlink6"> simply bewildered by your appearance here as the
philistine George Babbitt, a crass and prosaic bourgeois who was guided
entirely by materialistic rather than artistic or intellectual values.</a>
