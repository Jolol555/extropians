Years ago, in Chicago they used ultrasonic 'radar' - a pair of transducers
mounted on the signal standard that produced an audible click when the
pulse was sent, to sense vehicles on the expressway on ramps and off ramps.
I always though this made more sense than buried loops that are prone to
damage from traffic and weather, but all of these systems disappeared in
the later '70's.

Cameras at stoplights are becoming more common to catch light runners and
record accidents anyway, so the infrastructure is already there in some
cases. A further addition to the algorithm could measure the line of cars
waiting at the turn lane so the signal time could be more intellignetly
tailored to reduce tieups. This could also prevent that one moron who
refuses to drive all the way to the white line (and sensor) from preventing
the signals from cycling...
