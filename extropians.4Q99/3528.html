I think Damien and the other down under TH/EIs will beat me by a wide
margin.  If silly Motorola hadn't made the phones so expensive,
we could have all called each other simultaneously in a rotating
transition point to wish each other well.

<p>
However, that does raise an *interesting* idea!!!

I'm sure we could find some international company willing to
facilitate multi-node real-time conference calls.  Now, the real
trick would be to be able to intermix dial-ins and dial-outs.
It would be way too expensive to dial-out to dozens of people,
but if people were willing to bear the dial-in expense I bet
we could have a lot of fun with it.

<a name="3570qlink1">I would generally agree with Anders that the Internet is the best
way to do it, but this may not be available to many at the moment
of local-time-zone transition.</a>  We need a telephone-to-internet
bridge (or a pure telephone) interface that utilizes out-of-time-zone
connection infrastructure.  I might feel bad about monopolizing
a Moscow operator at midnight, but I've got no problem doing it
to an operator in Sidney or San Francisco at midnight Moscow time.

<a name="3563qlink9">Perhaps we could organize a signup sheet for the people that want
to be included in the calls at specific hours?  This would be
way cool, there might be no other group on the planet doing it...
