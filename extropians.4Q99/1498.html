&lt;&lt; Reptar (or whatever) who didn't seem to share my understanding
 of the point of morality - I was asking for his. &gt;&gt;

I don't agree with any 'set' point of morals. I seek understanding, which is 
quite different from believing I *have* understanding. Morality is very 
complex, and has meny points of direction, and i don't claim to be a 
philosopher, or bore the list with my own explorations of the field.

<p>
&lt;&lt; The point I raised in my original post was not that morality should be
 ditched and we should all conduct our lives conscience-free, but that the
 "rulebook" method of morality propagation is counter-productive, a situation
 I feel could be remedied at a price of more thought on the part of the
 individual.

I never disagreed with that, i disagreed with the statement you amde, which i 
deleted, which i called simplistic. The "no one's gonna tell me what to do 
goddamit" argument. And overly simplified. Rulebooks have been useful in the 
past, a large part of teh Old Testement was devoted to hygene and what the 
tribe should and should not eat. The problem is partly cultural, partly 
socialogical, partly geo/demographical. The uncertain terrain I was speaking 
of - in fact - backs your claim! 
<br>
For a rulebook to work, it must be for a small segment of populace, and be 
voluntary.
<br>
Our world expands exponentially, and in ways we cannot forsee. SO therefore, 
many of our current rulebooks are obsolete and stupid. 

<p>
That doesn't mean "throw out all rules except those that suit me".
