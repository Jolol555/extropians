<a href="1139.html#1308qlink1">&gt;&gt;The first thing religions started doing after they were invented</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is to start bashing science, a process that continues to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;present day. And Scientists have never threatened elderly</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;theologians with torture, nor burned them literally at the stake.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Religious leaders have done both...</i><br>


<p>
<a href="1247.html#1308qlink2">&gt;Religion pre-dates science by tens of thousand of years. A limited</a><br>
<i>&gt;number of scientists were involved in the torture-murders at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nazi camps, There were tens of thousands of slave laborers who</i><br>
<i>&gt;perished ar Peenemunde. Also thousands have worked, over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;decades,  in the biowarfare and nuclear weaponry, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt;currently aimed at civilians.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1326qlink1">I don't agree that religion is ten's of thousands of years older,
The first guy/Gal who made fire independently was the first
scientist, sadly that person probably was made the first
priest/priestess.

<p>
Yes scientists have been involved with warfare, and had I been
there I would have served proudly. But Scientists did not
torture/kill religious people simply for their views, theologians
have....

<p>
I've discussed at length previously the ridiculous notion of
</a>"civilians".


<p>
<a href="1247.html#1308qlink3">&gt;The point is that science is far from total responsibility, and</a><br>
<i>&gt;holding scientists to being such great moral authorities is as</i><br>
<i>&gt;crazy as holding religious leaders to such great esteem.   </i><br>

<p>
I never said they were great moral authorities, I said they hadn't
tortured/killed theologians just for holding a different viewpoint.

<p>
I was raised Catholic, and as an example Eratosthanes (sp?)
knowledge that the earth was round and his calculation within 5% of
the actual number in 399 B.C easily predates Catholicism.
