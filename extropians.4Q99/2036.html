    well, i guess that means i should back off my russian nuke sub obtainment 
plans, and lay off my attempts to stockpile the necessary vodka, kailua, and 
(powdered) milk... ;)
<p>
    so would someone please comment (or point me to a relevant archive ref) 
on the relative difficulties of moravic-style uploading versus the creation 
of gray goo? was the recent lobster neuron replacement really much of a 
milestone, as in, how far ahead of or behind 'schedule' was it? how are 
things shaping up on this front? and how does the fact that soft nanotech 
research is improving far faster then hard nanotech research enter into this?
<p>
    eliezer and cohorts [just in case you have any, eris forbid ;) ], im sure 
you can see where im heading with this...
