<p>
Of course, KPJ.  I suppose I was a bit flip, but trying to define
"homosexuality" or "sexual orientation" in any precise way seems
as impossible as Courts have found "obscenity"

<i>&gt; |correlative, compulsiveness).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One can define sexual behaviour between humans, consenting as well as</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-consenting, more easily than ``sexual orientation'' which appears</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have much fuzzier definitions, wildly differing among those who use</i><br>
<i>&gt; the term.</i><br>

<p>
Freud was well aware of this difficulty, and used the fascinating
phrase "polymorphous perversity" to denote the "sexual orientation"
of an infant which is subsequently differentiated and redistributed
with respect to libido. No trends are ever extinguished, however,
and to a significant degree "sexual orientation" if a function of
situationality. This matter is further confused by our culture's
equivocation between the biological and hedonistic aspects of
the behavior. Insofar as "sexual orientation" is not behavior, it
cannot be defined operationally, and as I suggest cannot be
defined at all.

<p>
<a href="3053.html#3091qlink3">&gt; The "cause" of homosexuality, and certainly this is a com-</a><br>

<i>&gt; |se, to search for a cause, because it is not a disease and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |therefore requires no cure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It would seem hard to define the ``cause'' of FOO, where FOO lacks a</i><br>

I'm sorry to edit out your most interesting illustration of this point,
but readers can refer to your original post.

Thanks for your reply,
