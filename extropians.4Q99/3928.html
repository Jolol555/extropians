Thank you, Dan, for demonstrating that us zombies experience frustration even
though we cannot Experience it.  I have often suspected that one of the goals of
Zen is to breakthrough this internal shadow theater of Experience so that one
can experience the world more directly.  I want to thank all who have joined in
this discussion, which although it could never have resolved anything (being
about the q word, and all), has made me realize that I am not conscious, and
have never been, although I thought I was.  This has freed me up from lots of
useless (to a zombie) conceptual baggage, and let me get on with trying to
understand how information processing systems (and other zombies) self organize,
represent external events and relationships, do problem solving, and get out of
bed in the morning.
