<p>
The original post (long since lost) said to ignore that
quibble.  The argument is over whether "the sun rotates
around the earth" is just as true as "the earth rotates
around the sun".  Technically, as you point out, both
rotate around a common mass, but to quibble back, that 
point is actually inside the sun.  

<p>
In any case there is a center of rotation;
wherever it is, the claim "the sun/earth do not go around
that point" would be wrong.
