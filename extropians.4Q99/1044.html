</a>
<p>
SHANGHAI, Oct 20 (AFP) - China, still preparing furiously for its first manned
<a name="1056qlink2">space mission, has already set its sights on landings on the Moon</a> and on the
<a name="1056qlink3">planet Mars, the official Shanghai News reported Wednesday.</a>

<p>
A recent national conference of space scientists held in southern Guangxi
province's Beihai city set the landings as the "two big targets" for the
country's
<br>
space programme in the 21st century.

<p>
"Chinese scientists are in the process of discussing details of the lunar
landing
<br>
(project)," Ye Zili, the China Space Science Association's general
secretary, was
<br>
quoted as saying.

<p>
He said dozens of plans and proposals for the twin projects had already
been put
<br>
forward.

<p>
The language of the report left it unclear whether the missions under
discussion
<br>
would be manned or not, but Ye cited the goal of "opening up the Moon's
resources."

<p>
No further details were provided on funding or the likely timetable.

<p>
While China's space programme is clouded in secrecy, a leading scientist
recently told reporters in Hong Kong the country did not expect to put a
man into
<br>
orbit until around 2005.

<p>
A retrievable empty capsule is in development and is due for a test flight
in the
<br>
months ahead.

<p>
The United States and the former Soviet Union wound up their race to land
human beings on the Moon in the 1970s and have shown little interest in it
since.

<p>
A series of unmanned probes have been studying the surface of the Red Planet,
however, and NASA expects to launch its first manned mission there around
2016.

<p>
The US probe Mars Polar Lander is due to touch down on Mars on December 3.

<p>
China has launched nearly 300 satellites into space since the early 1970s,
some
<br>
25 commercially.
