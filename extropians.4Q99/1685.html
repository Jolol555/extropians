<a name="1752qlink2">Sorry, Spike, but it isn't going to be that easy.  Foot soldiers won't be
obsolete until we can build equally capable robots for less than it costs to
train men, and that won't be for another 10-20 years.</a>

<a name="1752qlink3">The ability to bomb enemy leaders is not the same as the ability</a> to kill
them.  Even if it were, it is unusual to have a serious war in which killing
one man will change anything.  The really ugly wars are the ones that have
broad popular support, and in that kind of situation killing a leader just
gives the other side a martyr.

Desert Storm showed that air power has become the dominant offensive weapon
in relatively open terrain, but that leaves lots and lots of roles that must
still be filled by the infantry.<a name="1752qlink4">  Planes cannot capture terrain, they can
only weaken an enemies ability to resist.  Open terrain can be taken by
armored forces,</a> but in close terrain (and especially in urban areas) there
is no substitute for infantry - and since major cities are critical targets
in any real war, that means infantry remain essential even in a modern army.
