<a name="0372qlink2">Here in Illinois, the public schools have tests like these now. The state
mandates the tests and the schools are rated according to test scores. Poor
schools have been put on 'hit lists' until they bring up their grades.</a>

<p>
<a name="0372qlink3">The only problem is that if the state does this, it's just another
bureaucracy to get out of control. Private testing on the order of what UL
Labs does for electrical appliances, perhaps? A school could earn a 'Better
Housekeeping Seal of Approval'...</a>
