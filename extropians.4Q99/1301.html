It might be argued in the case of the dictators, that all policies, even 
clever ones have been necessitated toward facilitation of mass murder-which I 
submit was the prime-mover for Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Mao.  That maybe pure 
evil does exist beyond what Hanna Barbera deams; and that this evil is 
focused and self-sustaining.

is to invent a devil to hold all evils-thus removing oneself of

pro-active with bio-ethics committees and the like. So maybe technology has 
the ability to be self-correcting?
