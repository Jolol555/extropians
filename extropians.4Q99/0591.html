<a name="0642qlink2">Given the fact that I had no clue until yesterday that this binder even
existed, how could my own efforts possibly have discounted it?  And what
have I said or done to discount the efforts of people already doing media?

<p>
These kinds of accusations are not appreciated or appropriate.  I wrote this 
paper based on the encouragement of transhumanists worldwide who are
beginning to think about doing media, and in the paper I acknowledge the
contributions of the media experts and trainers who helped with some
questions I had.  It wasn't a secret that I was writing the paper, and I
would have included your materials in some fashion had I known about them.</a>  

<p>
In fact, I am open to revising the paper and redistributing it in another
version based on feedback and questions.  Should you reach a point of being
able to support that rather than attacking it, I welcome your input.

<p>
Take care,
<br>
Kathryn
