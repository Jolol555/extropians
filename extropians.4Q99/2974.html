<a href="2961.html#2974qlink1">&gt; Higher than a cat? There have been studies which I read about in a book by</a><br>
<i>&gt; Colin Wilson, that states in a remarkable way, that homosexuality was rare</i><br>

history
<br>

<p>
<a name="3040qlink1"><a name="2978qlink1">Homosexuality occurs in a certain percentage of rats, dogs, pigs, monkeys,</a>
dolphins, goats, sheep, and lots of other species.  Some monkeys who have
been taught sign language have engaged in homosexuality, prostitution
(negotiating food for sex), and lying about sexual behavior and eating
behavior.</a>

<p>
I have seen the studies that show homosexuality increases in overpopulated
and/or stressful conditions.  This is definitely true.  It may have
something to do with aggression, which also increases under these
conditions.  It does seem clear that individual animals do not change their
orientation under such conditions.  It seems to be that offspring born under
such conditions are more likely to be gay.  It may be some form of
population control.

<p>
Such a control would make a lot of sense to keep overpopulation from killing
off the whole pack.  It would be an advantage to have a pack maintain a
certain low percentage of gay rats, and to have that percentage increase
during overpopulation and decrease during underpopulation.
