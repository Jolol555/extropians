In addition, don't forget that the US government sponsors anti-male
legislation -- a statement that most Americans will vehemently deny, just as 
most Germans would have once denied persecuting Jews. But if you want proof, 
consider the VAWA (Violence Against Women Act) which
ignores violence against men,

I found the references to various studies regarding male and female violence 
patterns and rates very interesting.  I did not realize to what extent there 
is female on male violence.  Where this is done outside of self-defense 
there is no excuse for it but a key thing here is(at least where a weapon is 
not used) that men tend to be substantially larger and stronger then there 
partners and so are in a position of power where they can do much more 
psychological (intimidation) and physical harm.

<p>
I took a class last year called "Men and Masculinity" taught by a male 
professor I admired and interestingly enough was one of only three guys in 
the class, with the rest largely being middle-aged females.  We learned to 
deconstruct traditional male and female gender roles into a new paradigm of 
instrumental and expressive behavior.  I admit I had some trouble with that.

<p>
We studied the various men's movements and it's spokesman like Robert Bly 
who wrote "Iron John."  We learned how some believe that the males in our 
society have not just privilage but also great burden in the form of what 
they feel society expects of them and how this can even lead to an early 
grave.

<p>
I am glad I took the class but found no ready answers.  I felt my 
understanding of society and gender had been expanded though.  I found it 
very cathartic to write my term paper on the effects of an absentee father 
on a son.  I then sent a copy of my A paper to the father I have only been 
in touch with now for two years who disappeared from my scene when I was a 
baby.  He was not too thrilled by it but didn't want to talk about it 
either. lol

<p>
The people of the U.S. and the entire planet still have a long way to go but 
things have improved a great deal still in some areas and places.  I look 
forward to the time when both men and women can truely have all their 
options open to them and ignorance, violence and poverty does not stand in 
the way.


<p>
sincerely,
