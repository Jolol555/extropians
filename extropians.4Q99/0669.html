<a href="0660.html#0669qlink1">&gt; Eliezer, with all due respect, this isn't the first time that</a><br>
<i>&gt; Natasha has thrown around these kinds of accusation,...</i><br>

<p>
I'd just like to slip in a request that if you're going to air
your dirty laundry in public, at least give us spectators a program
so we call follow along.  Twice now you've referred to some alleged
"accusation" of Natasha's, but since the posts that did so did not
include reference text, I don't know what you mean.  The only thing
even remotely provocative I can find in the archives is this one
rather inelegantly worded paragraph:

<p>
<a name="0721qlink1">  "...the fact that you are now putting together media material cannot
  discount earlier materials put together by people who have been doing
  this for years.  Also, the fact that we have been doing this for years
  does not discount the work of your or other people who are putting
  media materials and press kits together..."

<p>
I suppose if you really stretched the limits of the language you might
be able to interpret that as an accusation that you've ignored earlier
efforts for some unspecified reason, but I certainly don't read it that
way.  It reads to me like just idle chest-pounding:  Hey!  Look at me!
I've done that too!</a> 

<p>
Natasha is fairly articulate, and certainly not timid, so if she wanted
to accuse someone of something I think she'd have no hesitation to do so
clearly rather than subtly.  The awkward paragraph above I'm sure is just
a result of haste.  If there's some actual clear accusation I've missed,
or if there's some offline reason for you to believe that Natasha meant
one of her comments that way, please enlighten us.  Otherwise it just
looks like you're overreacting to a misunderstanding and Natasha's just
being her usual vocal self.
