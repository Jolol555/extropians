Me: Yes, this is a strength of the skinsuit concept, particularly for Mars.

<p>
Surface pressure on Mars is generally under 10 mb, far less than the vapor
pressure of water at body temperature.  Sweat would *boil* on the skin...
this is close enough to a vacuum for practical purposes :)

<p>
A bigger problem for skinsuit wearers on Mars would be the peroxides in the
soil which turn to alkaline hydroxides when wetted.  (I know from personal
experience just how nasty alkali burns can be, my right eye has permanent
corneal scarring.)  Completely dust-tight overgarments would be difficult
to achieve, and airlock procedures would have to include rather fastidious
cleaning steps.
