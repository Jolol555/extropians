<a name="3567qlink1"><a href="3173.html#3439qlink1">&gt;I read about another idea for a "smart sneaker", this one was prototyped at</a><br>
<i>&gt;MIT I believe, and I think I read about someone putting it into production</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I'm not sure. Additional info would be appreciated.</a></i><br>

<p>
I seem to recall it was IBM who was touting this... They may have funded 
some work at MIT's Media Lab.

<p>
<a href="3173.html#3439qlink2">&gt;This sneaker contained information about you: your phone number, stats,</a><br>
<i>&gt;resume maybe, stuff like that. When you shake someone's hand, who is also</i><br>
<i>&gt;wearing this type of sneaker, a small voltage transmits all your info to</i><br>
<i>&gt;them, and theirs to you. Later you go home and look at all their info on</i><br>
<i>&gt;your computer.</i><br>

<p>
I'm not sure it was sneakers per se. But the cool (if safe) idea was to use 
your entire body to carry the
<br>
low-energy electric field needed to support a robust LAN protocol. It could 
work in conjunction with other
<br>
devices, too, such as a door handle that could interrogate and authenticate 
access privileges when you
<br>
come into contact with it, etc.

<p>
<a href="3173.html#3439qlink3">&gt;I think this would be great. Socially, it would serve the same function as</a><br>
<i>&gt;having a web page: you can have a store of information about yourself and</i><br>
<i>&gt;your interests that people can look at which might be awkward to bring up</i><br>
<i>&gt;out of the blue.</i><br>

business cards without fumbling".</a>
