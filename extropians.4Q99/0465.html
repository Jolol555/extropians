Credulity is one factor, in whether people are willing to accept what they
hear, but there are many others.

<p>
I think there are a lot of people who will immediately accept as true,
anything that they like.  If they think it sounds good, or if it supports I
position that they favor, they immediately accept it as true. But the same
person will immediately dismiss any idea that they don't like, or is too
weird for them.

<p>
On the other hand, their are open minded truth seekers.  Who will give fair
consideration to all ideas.  And only come to a conclusion after a great deal
of thought and research.
