BTW, I did *not* specifically say that you should *never* buy on good news. 
This can make sense if the news alerts you to a company that you then 
research, become convinced has much more good news ahead, and jump in even 
at a high price. (E.g. QCOM, EXDS, INKT.) Some great stocks have never been 
cheap--MSFT, CSCO, etc., yet have way outperformed the market. I also think 
it is possible to "buy high and sell higher" successfully, but only by 
applying rigorously mechanical investing strategies that take the emotion 
out of the process. These can be highly volatile, but the good screens 
should excellent returns back tested for 13-15 years.

Onward!
