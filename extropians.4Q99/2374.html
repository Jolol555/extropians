Hi Bob,

<p>
As I see it, the thread moved from a discussion of the need for rigorous science
in the study of societal evolution to one of debate concerning the role of
ethics in human affairs.

<p>
Since I find both these topics interesting, it seemed appropriate to try to keep
the threads going.

<p>
In my view, extropians/transhumanists need to continually re-emphasize the
importance of real science over and above the philosophical musings of social
commentators, because social commentary has a habit of tagging along with
political agendas and people with axes to grind.

<p>
As for ethics, I think science _can_ clarify this miasma if researchers can
overcome the politically correct aversion to the study of biology as it relates
to human behavior and systems of belief.

<p>
Thanks for the follow-up.

<p>
Live long and prosper,

<p>
--J. R.
