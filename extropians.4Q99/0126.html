<a name="0130qlink1">With very few exceptions, documentary or tangible evidence isn't 
<br>
"self-authenticating".  Even photographs have to have a live witness to <br>
testify that the scene in the photograph accurately depicts some location or 
event germane to the case at issue.  Derivative or analytical evidence, such 
as a DNA analysis, has to be "sponsored" by a live witness who testifies 
about how the evidence was obtained and/or created.  Such evidence is subject 
to pretrial discovery (and analysis by opposing parties) and all live 
witnesses are subject to cross examination.  Any statutes that attempt to 
circumvent these basic principles of due process have zero chance of 
surviving constitutional scrutiny.</a>
