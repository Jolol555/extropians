I have never understood the X-file Cult (nor the Star Trek "Fan
Club") -- bad science, monotonous plots, Bill Shattner -- although
someone said he and his corset had been replaced ...  In a totally
phony exercise in largesse, I pass along the "All-new Official Site
of The X-Files" to which a search engine aberration sent me:

<p>
<a href="http://www.fox.com/frameset.html?content=/thexfiles/index2.htm">http://www.fox.com/frameset.html?content=/thexfiles/index2.htm</a>

<p>
Again, for reasons incomprehensible to me, the page has a hotlink
called "Amor Fati" upon which, as a member of the Nietzsche Cult
and Fan Club, I had to click with this result:

<p>
-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-<br>

<p>
The Latin phrase "Amor Fati" translates to "Love of Fate."  Friedrich
Nietzche (1844-1900) used the phrase in his work, "The Gay Science":

<p>
"I still live, I still think: I still have to live, for I still have to think.
Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum. Today everybody permits
himself the expression of his wish and his dearest thought; hence
I, too, shall say what it is that I wish from myself today, and what
was the first thought to run across my heart this year--what
thought shall be for me the reason, warranty, and sweetness of my
life henceforth. I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful
what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make
things beautiful. Amor Fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not
want to wage war against that is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I
do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall
be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish
to be only a Yes-sayer."

<p>
-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-<br>

<p>
I haven't the faintest idea what this has to do with X-files, nor which
imp of the perverse composed this message with the evident intention
of embarrassing me.
