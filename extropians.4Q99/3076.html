<p>
TransVision is an annual gathering of (mainly) European 
transhumanists and other people who are interested in how 
contemporary &amp; future technological developments could best 
be used to overcome the biological limitations ( including 
death, disease and unhappiness) of the human condition. Not 
just the potential benefits of scientific progress will be 
discussed, though, but also the very significant dangers of 
war or accidents with advanced technologies. Topics may 
include cryonics, life extension, food supplements, 
nanotechnology, AI, mind uploading, the (technological) 
Singularity, genetic engineering, 'transhuman' music and 
art, smart drugs etc. Apart from these 'serious' issues 
there will be ample opportunity to eat, drink and be gay, 
of course.

<p>
TransVision 2000 will be held next summer somewhere in or 
around London; exact dates and locations aren't yet available 
in these early stages of planning (that's what this list is 
for). The event will most likely be spread out over 3 days, 
probably Friday-Sunday. 

<p>
The previous TransVisions were hosted by Transcedo in 
the Netherlands (in '98, see:
<br>
<a href="http://www.educa.com/transcedo/transvis.htm">http://www.educa.com/transcedo/transvis.htm</a>) and Aleph 
in Sweden ('99, see: <a href="http://maxm.normik.dk/tv99/">http://maxm.normik.dk/tv99/</a>). These 
were fairly small, "inside" gatherings for transhumanists, 
but this year's event is meant to be more open to the public, 
and will therefore be larger and (presumably) somewhat 
different in style. It will be hosted by the WTA (World 
Transhumanist Association, see: <a href="http://www.transhumanism.com">http://www.transhumanism.com</a>) 
and the Alcor UK group (see:
<br>
<a href="http://www.liberty.demon.co.uk/auk/index.html">http://www.liberty.demon.co.uk/auk/index.html</a>). 

<p>
If you want to keep in touch with developments (dates, 
locations, speakers etc.), have suggestions, questions 
or comments and/or want to help organising the event, 
you're welcome to join this mailing list.
