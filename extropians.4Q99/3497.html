Now *that* is interesting.  I tried emailing DL at his Cycorp address; I
didn't get a response.  Does your friend have an email address?

In answer to other questions:

No, I do not have the 1983 article.

Yes, you *would* think a major university would have a copy of those
journals, wouldn't you?  But when I was briefly a student at one
university, they didn't have the journal _Artificial Intelligence_, at
all, never mind back issues.  Actually, I would say that their whole AI
library was slightly inferior to the reference section of the local
public library, and was *considerably* inferior to Microcenter
Warehouse's book section.  Who knew?

the riffraff off campus, never mind out of the library.</a>
