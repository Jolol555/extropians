<a name="3910qlink1"><a name="3842qlink1">'What is your name?'  'Kate Riley.'  'Do you deny having written</a> the
following?':

<p>
<a href="3830.html#3834qlink1">&gt; Since you have said that we are all zombies, Mr. Fabulich, this</a> would mean </a><br>
<a name="3842qlink2"><i>&gt; that you also believe that we do not Experience anything.</a>  This ultimately </i><br>
<a name="3842qlink3"><i>&gt; would seem to be very much akin to the question of whether</a> or not anything </i><br>
<a name="3842qlink4"><i>&gt; exists, in the sense that both questions may, at least informally, be </i><br>
<i>&gt; answered in the same manner.  Perhaps you're familiar with the story.  I </i><br>
<i>&gt; forget the names, but let's call them Philosopher A and Philosopher B.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Philosopher A is going on at length about how nothing actually exists.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Philosopher B throws a rock at his head.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3846qlink1">I'm quite familiar with the story.  "Philosopher A," so the story goes,
was Berkeley, and "Philosopher B" was Swift.</a>

<p>
<a href="3830.html#3834qlink2">&gt; In the same token, there are inevitable base assumptions which must be</a><br>
<i>&gt; made before any philosophy becomes meaningful: first principles,</i><br>
<i>&gt; immediate knowledge, etc..  These things arise from experience.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Without the experience, there /is/ no basis upon which other arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be built.</i><br>

<p>
Look, I have a perfectly coherent theory in which Experience does not
exist, but in which the real world does.  So do cars.  So do I.  So do
you.  It's a theory under which I should dodge oncoming cars, just like
yours.</a>

<p>
<a name="3846qlink2"><a name="3842qlink5">Indeed, my approach of assuming that we "experience" (in the functional
sense) instead of Experience (in the spooky Cartesian sense) gives me all
the practical value I need: I'll still try to avoid being in "pain," still
attempt to maximize "happiness," etc.  Only I don't have to believe that
there's something spooky and Hard about the problem of mind.</a>

<p>
<a name="3846qlink3">You assert that without Experience, there is no basis for argument, but
you make this claim totally without justification!  Sometimes I get the
feeling that I'm arguing with 17th century thinkers about the existence of
God.  "Look," they say, "You simply have to have a notion of God!  
Denying His existence is logically contradictory!"  "How?"  "It's a
first principle!"</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3842qlink6">Dennett is in the habit of analogizing this debate to that over vitalism.
Can you imagine a living thing -- a living thing, mind you! -- denying the
existence of elan vital???  It's ludicrous!</a>

<p>
<a name="3922qlink1"><a name="3846qlink4"><a name="3842qlink7">You're telling me that your argument for the existence</a> of Experience is
<a name="3922qlink2">that...  it's a FIRST PRINCIPLE???  What the *heck* kind</a> of an argument</a> is
<a name="3929qlink1"><a name="3928qlink1"><a name="3922qlink3"><a name="3842qlink8">that?  This is dogma, not reason!</a>
