<a name="2976qlink1">It's also worthy of note that all known species of cephs have *really*
short lifespans by human lights.
<br>
Senescence/death appear to be plugged in to sexual maturity in cephs, more
so than even, say, mustelids.

<p>
So now, posit the ceph uplift requires extending their lifespan. If that
were done to the germline and
<br>
it got out into the world's ceph population somehow, what would the impact
be? With, or without, changing
<br>
their go-for-broke reproduction strategies (e.g., planktonic larvae</a> in some
species)?
