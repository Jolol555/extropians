My feel of the state of the knowledge at this point is that there
is fairly strong evidence that the dinosaurs ended quite abruptly
<br>
(based on fossil collections in South Dakota over the last year).<br>
Before this work, there had been some discussion that volcanic 
activity over an extended period could have contributed to a
gradual decline.

<p>
So, my impression is that currently the money is on the dinosaurs
buying the farm on the impact of the meteor (comet???) in Mexico.

<p>
At the same time there are several other extinctions that may have
been involved in massive climate changes due to CO2 production in
India or Siberia *and* other events that may have been triggered
by massive releases of the methane hydrates sequestered on the ocean
floors.  The geologists, paleontologists and astronomers are going
to have a lot of fun pinning these things down in a concrete way
as far as dates, % of species extincted and long term side effects
over the next decade or two.  This evidence they collect is going
to have to be reconciled head-to-head with the evidence that
the biologists gather from genome evolution.  When the dust settles
we may have a relatively good history of the development of life.
