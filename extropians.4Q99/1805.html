<a href="1771.html#1805qlink1">&gt; Get a clue, the God concept is the most distructive concept ever</a><br>
<i>&gt; unleased on man by man.</i><br>

<p>
It is the concept of religion that is so harmful.  The concept of God is
merely the concept of a Prime Mover.

<p>
Let me tell you about religion.  Anytime anything generally recognised as
good is widely accepted.  A number of people seeking to exploit this fact,
latch on to it, and make themselves its preisthood.

<p>
This has happened to the concept of God, of Government, of the Law, and of
the Ecology.  I know many statists and eco freaks that are at least as scary
as Jerry Fawell.

<p>
Let's face it, in this country most people who believe in God, embrace the
concept of a personal God, and they aren't anything like the way you fear
that they are.
