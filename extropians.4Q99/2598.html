There are a growing number of online fora in which issues relating to 
transhumanist technologies are being discussed by non-transhumanists.  The 
"Insane Science" mailing list on Onelist (isml@onelist.com) is a good source 
of information and views posted by folks who, by and large, have a more 
fearful approach to the future.  (Many of the news items I post here about 
opposition to genetic technology come from there.) Another, about which I 
learned there and which I've just joined, relates to "genetic modification".  
A post to the "Insane Science" list about the "GM" list is reproduced below.  

<p>
I'd like to encourage diplomatic participation on these other lists by 
extropians and transhumanists, as this sort of activity is a good way to 
broaden knowledge about our views and develop a more positive attitude about 
the future.

<i>&gt;  I am against all forms of Genetic Modification/ Engineering.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Human or otherwise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I set up a list that was originally just anti, it's now broadened to be pro</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and anti I haven't had any pro-GM subscribers yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The list now aims to be educational as well, this is not just a plug for my</i><br>
<i>&gt;  own list, I find this list very useful and forward articles from it, on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  GM front.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I am more than willing to debate with anyone who can find any pluses for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Genetic Modification that are not outweighed by the minuses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I very much like the style of this list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Further to the owner's previous mail, I would very much like him to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt;  this list going, I admit for partly selfish motives, I like the mix of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  articles, but also I like the general comment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  If you want the list to be more discussion led I am more than willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  participate.</i><br>
