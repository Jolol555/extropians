ECT, Electroconvulsive therapy is still used to treat some forms of
depression, with fairly good results. Psychosurgery is also done
today, although much, much less than in the past. Check medline for
studies on efficacies and methods.

There is a big deal of difference between respect and
credibility. Saying that the APA has no credibility is roughly like
saying that the IAU, the International Astronomical Union, has no
credibility. Sure, they have been wrong about things in the past and
even done stupid things, but that doesn't mean everything they do and
say can be discounted - there is plenty of good, well researched and
argued science going on too. What is needed is critical thinking to
separate the chaff from the wheat.
