It's no so much the number of people that upload as the number of copies
each of them will make, and then the number of other digital creatures
folks will make via other means.  Yes, storage resources will be limited,
so non-very-rich creatures will have to not treat them as if they were free.
Which means that at some point the price of storage will deter some copy
from storing one more memory.  Really, how could it be otherwise?
