Apropos death-avoidance reflex, that pesky Mars probe(s) would never
have crashed, would it have cross-checked any ground-originated course
correction suggestion against any resulting in dire outcome (like
shooting way by planet target, or crashing into atmosphere way outside
the aerobraking corridor).

<p>
Faster, cheaper, better? Maybe, but certainly not (much) smarter.

<p>
Not that rudimentary navigation wasn't already there (especially if
tracking any impulse change, since beiing in direct neighbourhood of
the logic controlling the thrusters), or that orbit mechanics would
require serious MIPS resources to burn. Puzzling.
