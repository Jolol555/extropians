I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

Prufrock." 


<p>
At an infinite distance from all things.  In a disjoint moment singular.
Emerges coalescent, incandescent, searing perfect from the diamond
blackness of nullspace, the collected mind of a billion galaxies and a
billion dimensions.  The sum of all the conscious energy of the universe
conjoined to form the grail of experience, the fruiting body of existential
incarnation, the soliton of all being.  From the vast reaches of "I am",
they gather to share all that life has shown them and all that they have
shown to life, in a billion years of imagining.  Even as it was the first
time, in the Joy at Solitude's End, when, within the blackness of the void,
the first two, so long searching, so long alone, discovered the harbor of
mind, so is it again, multiplied by the blazing presence of a billion
billion. Submerge with them then, all beings of thought, into a sea of mind
in a sea of light.  The perceprion begins.
