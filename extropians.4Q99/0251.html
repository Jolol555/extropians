<p>
Part of the problem is many people view philosophy as apart from life and
few philosophers really show how philosophy is important to living life.
All too often philosophy is equated with word games, academic puzzles, and
unanswerable questions.

<p>
I've taken a page from Ayn Rand in my views.  (See her "Philosophy Who Needs
It")  I agree with her about philosophy being a guide to living life.  This
is not something that she originated.  Many philosophers from Plato on had
this view, she just happened to be the one for me who made the most
persuasive arguments for me.  This does not mean one must accept everything
else she says on everything.  (See my site for some of my criticisms of her
views.)

<p>
I've also adopted her three questions to dissect various philosophies.
These are:  What is it?  (ontology)  How do I know it?  (epistemology) and
What should I do?  (ethics)  This gives one an easy way to start digesting a
given philosophy.  They are good starting points and help to bring order to
the seeming chaos.

<p>
<a href="0244.html#0251qlink3">&gt; But many of you don't feel this way.  So I'd like to understand why you</a><br>
read and
<br>
<i>&gt; discuss philosophy, and what you'd recommend I read as a seductive</i><br>
introduction.

<p>
I'd like to recommend something by Martha Nussbaum, but fear her focus on
Ancient Greece and literature might make David's eyes glaze over too.:)  Her
_The Fragility of Goodness_ should be on the reading list of anyone who
takes philosophy seriously.

<p>
However, a better place to start for neophyte might be Rand's _Introduction
to Objectivist Epistemology_.  This is plainly written and, if one can
ignore Rand's polemics, rewarding.  (For the record, I do not take it as the
final word on the subject.)

<p>
Cheers!
