Unfortunately, no.

As I understand it,  this sort of biometric system relies on 
metrics -- such as the distance apart your eyes are, or the distance
from your ankle to your knee joint -- that aren't easily modified but
which are visible in public.

If it was an effective defense, they _would_ ban it. These security
measures are for our safety and comfort; anyone trying to defeat them
is obviously either a predator or a misguided paranoiac who needs 
medical help. (That's the mind set of the current government; they're
doing this for public safety, and anyone who says otherwise can be
ignored because _of course_ they mean well, so their actions must be
good. Do you detect a certain logical fallacy here?)
