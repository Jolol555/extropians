With lots of very clever people with very different experiences and
perspectives, I don't think the purpose of the discussions is to form
a "correct" opinion.  Charting a single course into the future is
unlikely to be foolproof, so exploring multiple paths is probably quite
useful.  Most importantly we eductate ourselves in areas where we have
a lack of awareness and develop opinions about who can be trusted to
have knowledge and well thought out ideas in those areas.

I'm wrestling with Biotech and Astronomy, I can't wrestle with AIs,
nanotech, politics, art, morality &amp; philosophy, too.  I can however try
to follow the people who have their attention on those things.
Then in the future when they raise a red flag or suggest a specific
direction, I may know whether or not I should be a cheerleader or
a naysayer, rather than sitting there with a stupid look on my face
going, duuuhhhh...

<a name="2843qlink1">Most importantly, we are exploring a phenomena of "group mind".
I can't get my mind to agree with itself most of the time, so
I have little hope for getting "real" agreement among physically
distinct minds.  But I hope that some of our efforts allow the
"group mind" to collectively stumble forward.
