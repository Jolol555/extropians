<a href="3564.html#3568qlink1">&gt; As for trading, today was a rather flat day, actually NASDAQ was down</a><br>
<i>&gt; about 35 as I type this, but my two buys for the day were MESG which</i><br>
<i>&gt; went from 17 1/2 to 19 1/8. I purchased 2000 shares, held on for 3 hours</i><br>
<i>&gt; or so and sold for a 3200 dollar or appr. 10% gain,  the second was EGHT</i><br>
<i>&gt; which I purchased at 4 3/4 and sold at 6. 10,000 shares translated to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 12,500 dollar increase, or about 25%.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have no year to date figure for daytrading as I just started about 3</i><br>
<i>&gt; months ago.  In that time period I have run my 50,000 dollar starting</i><br>
<i>&gt; capital up to about 849,650 as of close of my trading today.</i><br>

<a name="3571qlink1">I don't doubt that your EV from these trades, and every trade you
make, is probably very high.  But as a poker player I have to say that
regularly putting 5% of your bankroll on a single bet--even if every
bet has positive expectation--produces an uncomfotably high probability
of ruin.  My poker expectation is about 2 bets per hour; but I have
upswings and downswings of 100 bets now and then.  It's not uncommon
for pros to have bad _months_.  Things generally level out at the
months-to-years level, but you better have the bankroll to outlast
those swings.  I keep track of my play and can quote you both expectation
and variance (19!).  Do you have similar stats for your trading?
