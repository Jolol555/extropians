<a href="1467.html#1469qlink1">&gt;Assuming that the probability is in fact uncertainty, do we not</a><br>
<i>&gt;still have a circularity in the definition?  Let's take coin</i><br>
<i>&gt;flipping. Let's pretend that we have good historical data showing</i><br>
<i>&gt;close to 50% heads / 50% tails, with no apparent correlation to</i><br>
<i>&gt;any other factor. So we hypothesize that the state sets that lead</i><br>
<i>&gt;to heads or tails are both about equal in size.  We've received</i><br>
<i>&gt;the 50/50 results *up until now* due to the flip occurring in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;world state that leads to heads half the time and tails half the</i><br>
<i>&gt;time.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1467.html#1469qlink2">&gt;Now consider future flipping.  Just because the state sets are</a><br>
<i>&gt;roughly equal in size, why do we believe that future flips will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;roughly equally divided between those that produce heads and</i><br>
<i>&gt;tails?  Because the probability of the flipper being in any</i><br>
<i>&gt;particular state from among the state space that leads to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;particular result is about 50%. So we're back to appealing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;probability.  We've moved the probability, not explained it.</i><br>

<p>
I'll make it more interesting.

<p>
I was watching a show about math, and there was a mathematician who
studied probability, and who was also an amateur magician. Bottom
line, he could stand there flipping a coin and produce any result
he wanted, he demonstrated flipping 10 consecutive heads for the
camera.

<p>
His point was about making sure you have a random process, I also
got out of it not to bet on coin flips with this guy...

<p>
Arthur "the brain" Rothstein would have been proud....
