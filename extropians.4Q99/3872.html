humanity will surely disagree with much of its philosophical output too.

were talking about philosophy when its obvious you're talking about
philosophical &gt;morality.  What "should" be done is always subjective because
it begins what one "feels" it should be.

Rob responded:
<br>
I was talking about philosophy. I have absolutely no interest in
entertaining the possibility of "objective morality". This is an American
preoccupation, born out of an insanely inflated society-wide
self-righteousness. I am not American, and there is no objective morality -
it's a ridiculous proposition.

think about how you might program a computer to posess this quality, and
what use it would &gt;&gt; be.

Consciousness has NOTHING to do with intelligence.  Many people consider

more conscious than them?

Rob responded:
<br>
I was proposing thinking about the implications and benefits of making a
computer "intelligent" to try and wash out some of the AI drivel that keeps
being bounced around the place. I did not mention consciousness - it has
nothing to do with my point.
