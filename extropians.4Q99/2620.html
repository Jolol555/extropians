Well, it is fair to ask then why you included two despised philosophers
in your list?

<p>
Then there are always inconvenient facts illustrated by the following:

<p>
Gottfried Leibnitz, German Philosopher, published his theory of the
infinitesimal calculus in October, l684, whereas Newton published his
calculus in 1704.  While they were essentially identical, Liebnitz's
notation was much more convenient, and that is why we still use
it, rather than Newton's, today.  At the time, Leibnitz was credited
for the invention of the calculus, which would have been just as
useful to the world if Newton had never discovered it.

<p>
Immanuel Kant, German Philosopher (1724-1804), was the originator
of what we today called "The Nebular Hypotheses", which offers an
explanation of the formation of the Solar System, i.e. the Solar System
formed, according to Kant, from a rotating gaseous nebula that slowly
contracted and condensed.  Pierre Laplace (1749-1827), French mathematical
 astronomer, further developed Kant's idea, in 1796, when it
became known as "the nebular hypothesis".

<p>
When, J.R., do you suppose this guild -- or should I say siege --
mentality of science vs. everyone else end?
