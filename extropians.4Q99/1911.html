George, I whole heartedly endorse your disconcertion, with the pervasive 
attitude regarding the sometimes, oppressive, mean-spirited, behavior of the 
Christian Fundamentalist Churches that have historically pervaded in the 
Southern Continental US since pre-Civil War days.  I am a target of their 
dislike also, but curiously enough, believe in God; just not their god. 

<p>
On this mailing list I am concerned, conversely, that a lot of the atheism is 
passionate, but not serious.  That it somehow is simply WASP culture with 
their Jesus excised out. But that WASP culture survives (opinions, attitudes 
<a name="1919qlink1">and beliefs) even though their view of God has been deposed.   The analogy 
would be like going to a Thai restaurant and dousing everything with 
</a>mayonnaise.  

<p>
Yours in Mother Shabooboo, Spud
