*Tiny tubes have a big future.Carbon nanotubes -- a remarkable form of soot<br>
that is stronger than steel at the weight of a plastic -- has unique
electronic properties that may hold the key to making flat- panel displays
the monitor of the future.

*Duke free-electron laser breaks 'psychological' 2,000 angstrom wavelength<br>
barrier. The OK-4, a Russian-built machine operating at Duke University, has
become the first free-electron laser (FEL) to emit laser light at deep
ultraviolet wavelengths shorter than 2,000 angstroms, a region some
scientists call "vacuum" ultraviolet.

*UT Southwestern researchers develop technique to determine protein<br>
communication, function. UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas
researchers report in today's Science on their new mathematical formula to
map the transfer of energy, the communication method of molecules, from one
area of a protein to another.

*The Nuts and Bolts of Cellular Engines. Whenever a cell changes its<br>
shape--like immune cells engulfing a pathogen or neurons reaching out to
connect to one another--there's a tiny engine at work. Now biochemists have
assembled a test tube model of this miniature motor.

  <li>  Chinese herb enhances recovery in stressed cells. Researchers at the
University of Chicago have found that extracts from the Chinese herb
Scutellaria baicalensis, contain powerful antioxidants that can
significantly reduce cellular damage due to free radicals-highly reactive
compounds that are generated during metabolism and which contribute to the
normal wear and tear of the cell.

the mouse, one of the most frequently used mammals in medical and behavioral
research, will be deciphered in a major new research program launched this

*New NASA track races toward cheaper trips to space. Speedy sports cars have<br>
met their match: A new magnetic levitation -- or maglev -- track at NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., accelerates a model
spacecraft from zero to 60 mph in less than one-half second

*'Rainbow metal,' similar to opal, suggests light-steering computer parts<br>
and catalysts Porous, rainbow-colored metal --inspired by opal-- may suggest
new materials to steer light inside superfast computers, or to more
efficiently catalyze chemical reactions, University of Delaware researchers
report Oct. 7 in Nature. Because it's riddled with regularly spaced holes
only slightly wider than the wavelength of light, the UD material acts like
a prism, diffracting a spectrum of colors--from gold and blue to red, green
and purple.

Multiplexer Scientists from Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) Bell Labs have
built the world’s first 10-gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) Ethernet multiplexer
that is compatible with dense wavelength division mutiplexing (DWDM)
transport.

*Scientists grow heart tissue in Bioreactor. MIT scientists use a<br>
NASA-developed device in a first step towards tissue engineering. The cell
constructs are less than 1/5-inch across, but represent a significant step
in developing replacement parts for damaged organs.

*Synthetic enzyme shows promise as way to make hydrogen cheaply. A<br>
look-alike enzyme active site synthesized by scientists at the University of
Illinois may move the world closer to an energy-efficient, hydrogen-based
economy, which could curb future energy crises and ease global warming.

*Pentium cluster makes a supercomputer. Cornell University has linked a<br>
cluster of 256 Intel Pentium III microprocessors together to act as a
supercomputer, the largest "tightly-coupled" system of its kind so far, and
probably the most cost-effective, built entirely with off- the-shelf
components. Such a cluster could easily be built almost anywhere and used
for many scientific and business applications, Cornell experts say.

*Scientists Blend Polymers To Create New Thin-Films. Even people who have<br>
never heard of polymer thin-films benefit nearly every day from products
made from these high-tech coatings. They're key ingredients in the
slow-release fertilizer they apply to their lawns and the timed-release
pills in their medicine cabinets. They're also used in multicolor
photographic printing, biomedical membranes, anti-reflective coatings, LCDs
and other useful products.

*Superheavy element 107 may soon find a place on the chemist's periodic<br>
table. Scientists have determined the volatility of bohrium, element 107 --
the heaviest element yet whose chemistry has been successfully investigated.
Crucial to the research was the use of a bohrium isotope detected earlier
this year by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and UC
Berkeley.

*New Design Will Help Cool Microelectronics More Efficiently. As<br>
microelectronics pack more high-powered computer chips into ever-shrinking
spaces, cooling these devices becomes more difficult. Ohio State University
researchers have developed a heat sink, or cooling system, that is more
efficient than current designs.

*TALKING PICTURES | A PICTURE MAY be worth a thousand words, but until now<br>
it hasn't been able to say them. Kodak is now aiming to change that and make
snapshots talk (EP 926 879). A new digital stills camera will have a
microphone which stores around 10 seconds of sound when a picture is taken.
So the photographer can say what the picture shows, where it was taken and
why. An ink-jet prints the picture image onto paper, with the speech data
converted into a bar code strip running along the bottom. This can then be
read by an infrared scanner which is swiped over the print. The scanner
converts the code into sound­so the picture speaks for itself.
