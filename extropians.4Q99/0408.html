WELCOME TO GODDARD'S ROLLER COASTER...
 
<p>
The evidence that a bomb went off in the concrete 
room is solid, and I believe the physical evidence 
proves that a bomb went off in the concrete room. 
There is additionally this interesting article: 
<a href="http://spotlight.org/Sept_26/Rangers/rangers.html">http://spotlight.org/Sept_26/Rangers/rangers.html</a> 

<p>
However, the following facts I just learned make 
me feel it's probably impossible to prove that the 
source of that bomb was not the Davidians. Records 
of purchases made by the Davidians from gun dealer 
Henry McMahon prove that during 1992 the Davidians
acquired these explosives and explosives materials:


<UL>
  <li>  40-50 pounds of black gun powder 
  <li>  90 pounds of aluminum metal powder
  <li>  30 pounds of Potassium Nitrate 
  <li>  5 pounds of Magnesium metal powder 
  <li>  1 pound of Igniter cord (a class C explosive) 


</UL>
<p>
That's a lot of explosive power and ingredients 
for such power! The Davidians also did business 
with other gun dealers. I'd be willing to bet that 
they stored those explosives in the concrete room,
which would be wise (assuming it's not filled with
women and children). Now, if there is reason to 
believe that there's that kind of explosive power 
in a house, and a massive explosion occurs in that
house, the most probable explanation is NOT that 
someone else entered the house and planted a bomb.

<p>
The list of purchased explosives above was raised
in court and not contested by the Davidians nor 
their lawyers. The only issue raised in response
was that it was legal to purchase those items.
While I was recently informed that they had some 
black powder, but I did not realize how much. 

<p>
I've been told that the explosive agents above 
are not high explosives. However, according to 
one explosives resource, 4 onces of a 2-to-1 
mixture of an oxidizer like Potassium Nitrate
and Aluminum Powder is equal to one stick of 
dynamite. Therefore, just those two agents in the 
list above have power of at least 182 sticks of 
dynamite! In a closed space, that might do some 
serious damage; and throw in 50 pounds of black 
powder to boot... KaBoom! This assumes of course 
that they were mixed properly, but I really doubt 
that those explosives ingredients were purchased 
along with a pound of Igniter cord not to be mixed.


<p>
THE DOWNWARD-BENT REBAR

<p>
As I noted, melted glass was found inside the room. 
This made me wonder if the downward-bent rebar may 
have been a result of it starting to melt. I was 
informed that the melting point of steel is 2800
degrees. I also found that the "glass transition
temperature" is 932 degrees, in both cases, in
Fahrenheit. So the glass could melt and the steel
not melt. However, I've just learned that the 
temperatures inside the room reached above 2000 
degrees, so it's possible that the rebar started 
to melt and in so doing began to sag downward.
I've seen video of the room after the house was
gone and fire was blazing out of the top part of
the doorway, so it was probably also blazing out
of the hole. I wonder what was burning so fiercely?

<p>
It's also possible that the sudden explosion of
a large cache of explosives inside the room would 
blow the hole that we see through the roof, and
it's very plausible that it would distribute the 
debris on the inside as we've seen. Or explosives 
stored in the room above the concrete room could
account for the damage seen. So it seems to me 
that the evidence pointing to a bomb is most 
probably linked to the probably unintentional 
ignition of explosives that the Davidians had.

<p>
It's also been suggested that the hole in the 
roof was caused by a military shaped charge, but
I can't find any evidence of the existence of 
shaped charges that would not also take out rebar.


<p>
IN CLOSING...

<p>
Well, I stand behind my initial proof that a bomb 
exploded and demolished the interior of the room, 
and I think it was proper to raise this issue and
speculate (as I did) that the government -- i.e.,
the people who were shooting at and thus trying to 
kill those inside -- did it. If a dozen people are
shooting at people in a house, and then a bomb goes 
off in that house, and it's admitted that some of 
those people went into the house, on its face, it
stands to reason that those attempting to murder 
those in the house did it. However, I now strongly 
suspect the Davidian's stored a large cache of 
explosives that was exploded by the fire.

<p>
Since the purpose of my Waco-Bomb page was to 
make a plausible case against the government, and 
since I don't feel there is a plausible case in 
this case regarding the bomb, the purpose of the 
page has technically expired; but I'll leave the 
evidentiary photographs up. If someone can convince 
me that the explosion cannot have been caused by 
the Davidian's own explosives stockpile, then 
I'll put the page back up.
