<p>
Here is a very simplified summary of specific ideas derived from the
Works of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) that are widely accepted
without the slightest awareness of their origin and even by those
who profess to loathe the author and the philosophy which introduced
 them.  I wish to thank Paul Brians for his scholarly work and
recommend a visit to his page the URL for which appears at the end
of this post.

<p>
[1]   The goal of life should be to find yourself. True maturity means<br>
<p>
       discovering or creating your own identity.

<p>
[2]   The highest virtue is to be true to yourself.<br>

<p>
[3]   When you fall ill, your body is trying to tell you something;<br>
<p>
       listen to the wisdom of your body.

<p>
[4]   People who hate their bodies or are in tension with them need<br>
<pre>
       to learn how to accept and integrate their physical selves with
       their minds instead of seeing them as in tension with each other.
       The mind and body make up a single whole.

<br>
[5]   Athletes, musicians, etc. especially need to become so attuned<br>
       to their bodies that their skills proceed spontaneously from the
       knowledge stored in their muscles and are not frustrated by an
       excess of conscious rational thought. (C.f. of Zen Buddhism)

<br>
[6]   Sexuality is not the opposite of virtue, but a natural gift that needs<br>
       to be developed and integrated into a healthy, rounded life.

<br>
[7]   Many people suffer from impaired self-esteem; they need to work<br>
       on being proud of themselves.

<br>
[8]   Knowledge and strength are greater virtues than humility and<br>
       submission.

</pre>
<p>
[9]   Overcoming feelings of guilt is an important step to mental health.<br>

<p>
[10] You can't love someone else if you don't love yourself.<br>

<p>
[11] Life is short; experience it as intensely as you can or it is wasted.<br>

<p>
[12] People's values are shaped by the cultures they live in; as society<br>
<p>
       changes we need changed values.

<p>
[13] Challenge yourself; don't live passively.<br>
