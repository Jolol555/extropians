Subject: external fixation device


<p>
<i>&gt;Hey Nano,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was wondering if you or someone in your circle of technology  would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;capable of making ten working prototypes of my invention.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The invention is an external fixator for finger fractures.  It is</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific for a fracture of a finger involving a joint.  To better</i><br>
<i>&gt;appreciate its purpose you have to have an understanding of finger</i><br>
<i>&gt;fractures.  When treating fractures involving the fingers the doctor is</i><br>
<i>&gt;caught between a rock and a hard place.  Fractures involving the hand</i><br>
<i>&gt;and fingers take roughly 6 weeks to heal.  Unfortunately the joints in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the hand get very stiff from lack of motion. If a fracture is very</i><br>
<i>&gt;severe it may involve the joint as well.  The current treatment consists</i><br>
<i>&gt;of putting pins across the fracture to hold the bone fragments</i><br>
<i>&gt;together.  Sometimes pinning the joint itself so that it doesn't move.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So the answer to this dilemma was to create a device that allows motion</i><br>
<i>&gt;and at the same time immobilizes the fracture.  It also has to be small</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough not to hamper motion of the other fingers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have access to a number of orthopaedic hand surgeons in the country</i><br>
<i>&gt;who would like to try my device out. I worked at the Mass. General</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hospital in Boston for a number of years and had a nice working</i><br>
<i>&gt;relationship with the residents, fellows and chiefs in the hospital.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt;number of these people have left to become department chairmen for other</i><br>
<i>&gt;orthopaedic university hospitals.  It is sort of a rite of passage after</i><br>
<i>&gt;attending Harvard.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have a rough prototype that was made in a garage.  Unfortunately the</i><br>
<i>&gt;model I have is too crude to be of any functional use. Nevertheless I</i><br>
<i>&gt;decided to patent the device.</i><br>
<i>&gt;To my dismay the orthopedic manufacturers weren't interested with my</i><br>
<i>&gt;device because they have this we can do it better mentality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I already have people who want to try it and a partner who wants me to</i><br>
<i>&gt;pursue it even more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I hope you can help me with this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kind regards,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Henry</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
