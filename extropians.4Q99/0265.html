    well... i guess im not quite sure about the unnecassary part. ive found 
that, by using words similar to 'meat' on a regular basis, im able to get 
people do a mild doubletake, and from there, im able to get into very 
positive conversations with them. i think this is functionally similar to ayn 
rand's use of the word 'selfish'.

<p>
<a href="0253.html#0265qlink2">&gt;  `Meat' is dead flesh intended for eating. Few of us eat human remains.</a><br>

<p>
    lol... well, ya know, every once in a while i chew my fingernails, but i 
have yet to resort to anything even close to being along the lines of soylent 
green, although i dont quite understand the common revulsion to the idea. if, 
eris forbid, something terribly damaging happens to this bioshell, and it no 
longer serves to weave my consciousness, i have given several close friends 
permission to grok the fullness of my existance, if they could get away with 
it ;)

    it is my understanding that my dad ate take-out chinese [sorry, had to 
say it] during the (near the end of the) korean war. i guess he was stuck 
down under the pusan peremeter, and had ammo, but no food. macarthur hadnt 
landed yet, ya see. well, so my old man had ammo and no food, while the 
chinese had no ammo, and no food, and ya do whatcha gotta do, i suppose... i 
guess ya wanna keep em alive as long as you can; keeps the meat from being 
damaged by the cold. ::shrug:: whats done is done. but has this hit the press 
at all? ive never really heard about it, other then via my dad, and one of 
his old war buddies (assisted by liberal applications of bad-tasting 
alchohol)...
<p>
    &lt;/meaningless side note&gt;

<p>
    i dunno. id go so far as to say that shock value is a good thing. i want 
people to think twice about some of the things i say. which would we rather 
have: passing attention, or notoriety? ::strikes cheesy austin powers pose:: 
ARE WE NOT REVOLUTIONARIES, MAN!? hehe...

<p>
<a href="0253.html#0265qlink5">&gt;  I'd like to suggest a moratorium on this usage, not because I'm squeamish</a><br>
<i>&gt;  but because a vast number of the people we'd like to guide to a better</i><br>

<i>&gt;  replacement, but perhaps *protein body* might do? That's also a tad</i><br>
<i>&gt;  dehumanised, but it doesn't have the swaggering adolescent taint of *meat*.</i><br>

<p>
    yea, i understand. mindless rebellion is as bad as mindless conformity... 
but i dont think thats whats goin on here, at all, and i dont think thats how 
its commonly percieved. (yea, i know... wtf do i know of "commonly"? am i a 
poll?) but, as purely anecdotal evidence, i present that i have had nothing 
but positive experiences with people whom i have used the word at.
