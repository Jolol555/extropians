Allow me to differ over dogs and cats, too. I have a couple of pet
cats and I an very fond of them, but I am not sure I would want to share
a universe with them if they were fully sentient tool-users!

Cats are not little humans in fur coats. They're diurnal arboreal
carnivores, and the only reason we think they're cute is that we're
much, MUCH larger than they are and they're just smart enough to know
that we feed them.
