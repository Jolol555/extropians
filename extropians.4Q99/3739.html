Regarding centrifuging guppies and other critters IN A LIQUID MEDIUM to see
how they tolerate g-loads

&lt;TEN MINUTES?!? Whoa, Nellie!!&gt;

<p>
Which seems to suggest that ten minutes at 100 gees is some serious
exposure.  Perhaps.  But let's  have some context.

<p>
In spike's original experiment, he writes that he

<p>
<a href="3650.html#3739qlink1">&gt;bought a dozen guppies, put em in a plastic thermos bottle,</a><br>
<i>&gt;put the bottle in the centrifuge and spun em up to 100 g for 10</i><br>
<i>&gt;minutes.</i><br>

<p>
Now if the thermos bottle is upright at the bottom of the centrifuge, and
if the liquid level is nine inches, then the hydrostatic pressure at the
very bottom is (100 gees x .75 ft) the equivalent of a water depth of 75
ft. (If the two meter centrifuge had a two meter water column, the median
gees for the column would be 50, and the pressure at the very bottom the
equivalent of approx 350 ft of water.)  Now guppies don't normally live at
these depths, but all in all I would guess the stresses of such
exposure--the hydrostatic stresses, that is-- to be utterly trivial.
<a name="3776qlink1">Whether for ten minutes or ten years. (After a while, they did stop
swimming in spirals, didn't they, spike?</a> )

<p>
<a name="3776qlink2">So, as I mentioned previously, I'm looking at mechanical stresses on the
skeleton as the likely limiting factor/mode of failure.</a>

<p>
A serious test would be to spin them up, and determine the locus of
points--plotted as duration vs gee load (depth of the supporting liquid
medium kept constant and at a minimum)--where they suffered some
irreversible effect/injury .  I wouldn't be surpised if it happened--for
fish--around 5-10,000 gees. 

<p>
<a name="3765qlink1">The situation for humans is complicated by the problem of gas filled spaces
in the interior of the body--lungs, sinuses, middle ear, semicircular
canals of the inner ear, and bowel gases.  Fill the lungs, sinuses and
middle ear with fluid, and you probably wouldn't have a problem up to oh,
say, a thousand gees.  If the blastronaut were lying on a molded support,
to evenly support the downward pressure of the bones, the only part of the
skeleton not supported would be the anterior portion of the rib cage, and
the bones of the middle ear. 

<p>
So, tentative conclusion, no big deal.  Meanwhile, ten minutes at a mere
100 gees gives you 1,309,150 mph terminal velocity.  One second at 1000
gees gives you 21,800 mph.  Whoa, Nellie, indeed!</a>
