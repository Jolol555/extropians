<a href="0962.html#0969qlink1">&gt;It is going to be very interesting to see if governments get to</a><br>
<i>&gt;the point of trying to regulate the actions of their citizens</i><br>
<i>&gt;in other countries!?!  I.e. A German citizen who wants to manage</i><br>
<i>&gt;a N site located in the U.S. or a U.S. citizen who wants to</i><br>
<i>&gt;sell guns on a site in Cuba, etc.</i><br>

<p>
Governments have been in the business of regulating their citizens'
non-domestic activities for years now.  They do not work hard at
enforcement, though.

<p>
<a href="0962.html#0969qlink2">&gt;If I ship my gun to a friend in Cuba, he takes 10% and then</a><br>
<i>&gt;ships the gun to some teenager in the U.S., have I violated</i><br>
<i>&gt;a law? [Perhaps a "conspiracy" to violate a law?]  </i><br>

<p>
Since a farmer feeding his hogs has been deemed interstate commerce, 
I'm sure that you would have committed several felonies.

<p>
<a href="0962.html#0969qlink3">&gt;Governments may have some hope of regulating the sale of guns or </a><br>
<i>&gt;drugs, but "data" seems pretty impossible to regulate.</i><br>

<p>
It's very easy to *regulate*; it's just hard to enforce.
