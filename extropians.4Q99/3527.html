You *assume* it is desireable to remember *everything*.  But
if we could not forget we would go crazy  [er].  If we had access
to very long lives, we would want to forget in some way, otherwise
we run the risk of boredom.

<p>
Consider the artform where a number of square photos of something
like flowers are placed in a grid whereby they form another larger
picture, such as Princess Di.  Viewed up close, flowers.  From a
distance, Di.  Seems like we could arrange a number of these
larger pictures into a grid until they form yet another larger
picture which could only be percieved at a still larger distance.
Likewise we could zoom in to the flower photos and find that
they too are made up of pixels which are themselves complete
photos of something else, such as birds, these in turn being
made of something else.

<p>
May our uploaded memories ever perceive new pictures as
we recede thru eternity, ever losing the ability to recall at
some level of detail, but being compensated with new layers
of meta-understanding.  spike
