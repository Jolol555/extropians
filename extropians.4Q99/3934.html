_Science_'s list of the top 10 discoveries for 1999 includes four items
I didn't even hear about, which I've marked with asterisks (*).  I've
also included two other items I found interesting.

<p>
<i>&gt; Blueprints for the Protein Factory: A grueling,</i><br>
<i>&gt; decades-long attempt to solve one of biology's most</i><br>
<i>&gt; frustrating puzzles had a eureka moment this year with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the creation of the first complete molecular map of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ribosome, the cell's essential protein factory. Several</i><br>
<i>&gt; groups of researchers had a hand in sorting out the</i><br>
<i>&gt; details of the ribosome's dauntingly complex structure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Energized by this flurry of success, scientists are now</i><br>
<i>&gt; hoping to catch a glimpse of the ribosome as it</i><br>
<i>&gt; operates its protein assembly line, engaging in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most basic activity performed by all living things. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; *The Weird World of Quantum Matter: This year</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists created a bizarre new kind of gas that may</i><br>
<i>&gt; one day help them probe the basic nature of matter and</i><br>
<i>&gt; build the next generation of atomic clocks and lasers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The gas consists of atoms that fall into the category of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fermions, one of nature's two types of elementary</i><br>
<i>&gt; particles, which by definition are antisocial particles</i><br>
<i>&gt; that refuse to occupy the same energy state. Now a</i><br>
<i>&gt; team of scientists has coaxed a swarm of fermions</i><br>
<i>&gt; into a state where they are precisely arranged in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; ladder of energies. This achievement clears the way for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the creation of a completely new type of quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter-a counterpart to the famous Bose-Einstein</i><br>
<i>&gt; condensate (Science's Top Advance of 1995) made</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the other type of elementary particle, the boson. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; *Complex Life Gets a Billion Years Older: This</i><br>
<i>&gt; year researchers pushed back the beginnings of</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex life by a billion years after finding telltale</i><br>
<i>&gt; signs of eukaryotic cells (which contain a nucleus) in</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2.7 billion-year old Australian rocks. These primitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; inklings of life were unearthed with the help of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; technique that searches for the residue of molecules</i><br>
<i>&gt; produced by cells. The chemical signatures left by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Australian ancestors indicate that this ancient world</i><br>
<i>&gt; was populated by eukaryotes much earlier than</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists had thought.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; *A Flat Universe: The universe's tally of matter and</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy finally added up in 1999 as researchers</i><br>
<i>&gt; confirmed their hunch that the cosmos was born in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; burst that stretched space flat. A flat universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; requires just the right density of matter, and up until</i><br>
<i>&gt; this year scientists had searched in vain for enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter to fit the bill. But last year's discovery (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; was Science's Top Advance of 1998) suggested that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mysterious energy pushing the universe's expansion</i><br>
<i>&gt; might fill in the missing matter. This year, new</i><br>
<i>&gt; information from a variety of locations showed ripples</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the microwave background, the afterglow of the Big</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bang, that are exactly the right size to imply a flat</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Molecules Make a Memory: A series of findings this</i><br>
<i>&gt; year has made it easier to comprehend how memories,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the most intangible of human experiences, are formed</i><br>
<i>&gt; by concrete molecular activities in the brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scientists used new methods to film neurons laying the</i><br>
<i>&gt; groundwork for memories and gained new insight into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the molecules and steps involved in the process. *The</i><br>
<i>&gt; power of these interactions was dramatically</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrated when scientists genetically engineered a</i><br>
<i>&gt; strain of mice that produced an abundance of one such</i><br>
&gt; molecule and were unusually successful at learning<br>
&gt; mazes. <br>

<p>
(!!)

<p>
<i>&gt; A Plethora of New Planets: Reports of new planets</i><br>
<i>&gt; in neighboring solar systems poured in throughout</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1999, increasing the tally of known extra-solar</i><br>
<i>&gt; planets to almost 30. And while previous sightings</i><br>
<i>&gt; were indirect, this year, astronomers actually caught</i><br>
<i>&gt; one crossing the face of its star, confirming the</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence of exoplanets. The latest batch of exoplanets</i><br>
<i>&gt; even contains worlds that orbit in the habitable zone of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their parent stars, where liquid water and life could</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist. While none of the planets discovered so far</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually has what it takes to support life, theorists</i><br>
&gt; think that the universe should be teeming with more<br>
&gt; planets that await discovery.<br>
