<p>
No, there may indeed be some degree, but I would say that it can vary wildly 
from 0% to 100%.  My question to you is this; how do you determine whether 
someone is fooling themselves about being in love or actually is in love?</a>  I 
think a good way to tell when you are fooling yourself about being in love is 
when it takes more and more effort to summon that feeling.  Another would be 
to ask yourself; if someone else told me they were in love for the reasons 
I'm in love, would I believe them?  Just some thoughts.

<p>
<a name="3082qlink2"><a href="3065.html#3077qlink2">&lt;&lt; More generally, you seem to deny my suggestion that people fool themselves</a><br>
 into thinking they are more thoughtful, creative, etc. than they</a> are.&gt;&gt;

<p>
I was wondering if you would do that&lt;g&gt;.  I ascribed to myself the attributes 
of thoughtfulness and creativity soon after you had finished saying that "we 
fool ourselves into thinking that our values are the ones others would 
approve of, and are not very aware of the degree to which our values are 
otherwise."  So, am I deluding myself into believing I am thoughtful and 
creative?  Maybe so.  How would one check?  I suppose two ways would be to 
look for internal inconsistencies in my life and use an external check of the 
opinions of others.  I won't go through the first here, as depending on the 
level of my denial, I could be ignoring the inconsistencies.  Now then, we 
can ask others if I am thoughtful and creative.  You'll just have to take my 
word that, in the past, these two qualities have been attributed to me many 
times before by many different people.  We can also ask those who have 
interacted with me here on the list if I have seemed thoughtful and creative 
in my postings (of course, maybe I've just been faking it really well and 
fooling everyone&lt;g&gt;).  I will say this much...I am not perfectly thoughtful 
and creative.  I have had moments when I have been heedless of another's 
feelings, and where my muse has deserted me.  However, for the most part I 
think these are traits that I can subscribe to myself in general, and to 
claim otherwise would not be reporting my true feelings on the subject.  That 
is one of the reasons why I mentioned those qualities, even though I thought 
it likely that you would respond to them as you did.
 
<p>
&lt;&lt;I'm not sure I can do much here to change your mind, other than to point
 you to the vast literatures on the topic.  You might start wit the word
 "limerence".

Sure there is!  I did preface my statements by saying, "I may be wrong."  I 
try to admit the possibility of error, and am willing to challenge my own 
beliefs, even about myself.  However, I take a lot to convince&lt;g&gt;.  I'll have 
to start as you suggested, looking into the term "limerence".  As for this 
vast literature on the topic, would you care to recommend some as a good 
starting point?  Online sources would be easier as I do not have a lot of 
free time at present.

<p>
Now then, is there aught that I could do to change your mind?

P.S. - By and large I find the "romantic ideal" as much as a harmful meme as 
helpful.  I consider it an artificial construct that owes much to the Court 
of Eleanor of Acquitane&lt;sp?&gt;.  However, as I said before, I do enjoy it, and 
have found it of use in my life, so I have kept it, but always realizing that 
it isn't an absolute.
