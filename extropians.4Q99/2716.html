I would try to understand and upgrade myself.  That's more than enough
<a name="2726qlink1">interesting material to occupy me until my mind ages into senescence,
assuming I'm not successful in uphacking around</a> it.  If my mind did age
into senescence, I'd have to suspend my code, activate the backup
version, let me2 look at me1's old notes, and hope the process could be iterated.

<p>
Actually, I'd really want three people in there.  Two to take turns
hacking suspended versions (that way both can be upgraded and both can
gain experience in upload-hacking), and one baseline normal to
supervise.  Any of the three would probably have the opportunity to
<br>
"seize power", so den Otter will have to come up with something more<br>
complicated and error-prone for his Community of Selfish Uploads.

<p>
How *do* you plan to do upgrades in perfect synchronization, den Otter?
