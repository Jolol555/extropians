<a href="2786.html#2797qlink1">&gt;Consider this question:  It is natural to say that the sun revolves around</a><br>
<i>&gt;the earth; we refer to the "rising/setting sun" as if we believed that</i><br>
<i>&gt;this was what was really going on.  Why?  Because it SEEMS like the sun</i><br>
<i>&gt;revolves around the earth.  But what would it seem like if the earth</i><br>
<i>&gt;revolved around the sun?  Similarly, what would it feel like if "red" WAS</i><br>
<i>&gt;the objective movement of matter?</i><br>

<a name="2800qlink1">You're starting to lead into the real issue. I can draw you a diagram of an
earth and a sun, with the earth revolving around the sun, explain how the
earth rotates, draw a little stick figure guy on the surface of the earth,
and explain, in a way which would be comprehensible given a little insight,
how although the earth revolves around the sun, it seems the other way
around since the earth is rotating. Nobody can currently give a similar
description of consciousness.</a> That doesn't mean it's not possible (although
I have my suspicions). Maybe when we have understanding of it, we will
realize that qualia is a confused term, referring to part of a phenomena, or
several phenomena. I would say qualia is "what it seems like", or, if qualia
<a name="2800qlink2">only seem to exist and don't really exist, I refine my definition saying
qualia is ""what it seems like" seems like".
