I understand you sentiment in this post and was swayed by its mellifluous
tone.

<p>
At a time when the overcoming death is the war cry in the battle on
disease, it seems that the common sense perspective would require one to be
self-aware and self-protective. If the mission is to overcome death and
enhance our humanness, the element of collaborative cooperation is
imperative to achieving the goal and winning the battle.  In that I see
this directive - overcoming diseases and the finality of death - as the
foundation for our future as transhumanists, the concerns of selfishness
vs. altruism seem to loose momentum.  I believe you express this sentiment
below:

<p>
<a href="2271.html#2416qlink2">&gt;I believe that the most important quality in the universe is self.  But </a><br>
<i>&gt;not my self alone.  (snip)  I believe in </i><br>
<i>&gt;responsibilities of proximity and scale and competence. (snip)</i><br>

<p>
As you, I find altruism hanging on a coat rack in an antiqued chamber.
Kindness is more available and capable of bringing a positive result,
especially in a transhumansit spirituality, and also self esteem works
nicely with self-responsibility.

<p>
Cheers!
