<p>
I was born premature.  In my first year of life, I was declared legally dead
three times.  Each time, my infant body was placed in a body bag, and the
time of death noted.  Each time, my mother's doctor arrived, pulled me out
and performed resuscitation.

<p>
I was told these stories throughout my childhood.  Even before I understood
what death was, I felt that I had died three times and come back.  I also
felt like some doctors were good and could save me, while other doctors are
bad and would give up.

<p>
I have always been worried about my mortality for as long as I can remember.
I also have been worried about bad doctors giving up, and the medical
establishment ignoring controversial therapies.  I was interested in
nutrition and life extension very early.  In the 1970s, the idea that diet
could fight heart disease or cancer was considered quackery.  I even wrote a
story when I was about 10-11 years old about a child who was killed and
brought back to life.  I got the idea from Frankenstein, but tried to take a
more scientific approach.  I remember thinking that Dr. Frankenstein was a
brilliant doctor who was far beyond his time, and was misunderstood by his
peers.  Most of my friends thought he was a horrible, misguided creator of
monsters.

<p>
Anyway, the idea about fighting death occurred to me early in the '60s and
'70s.  I have been fighting death ever since.
