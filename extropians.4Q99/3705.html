Yes, it is very cool.  Life crossing interplanetary space, wow.
I understand it's an occaisional thing but I don't have details.  We
don't have detailed information even on the occurances of major
asteroid strikes on Earth, just rough frequency analyses.

<p>
Very much so.  However, I think most scientists are more interested
in Mars science in general than in the possible history of Earth-
 biotransfers.  If, as we currently think, the surface of Mars
is currently sterile then our introductions won't cause any trouble
anyway.

<p>
<a href="3699.html#3705qlink3">&gt;To risk sending humans very soon still sounds to me</a><br>
<i>&gt;sort of like sending whole "boatloads" of potential bio-contaminants,</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibly to the point of confusing some important life search results.</i><br>

<p>
Quite true.  Most things can't survive a year-long trip in outer
space.  Many more organisms could transfer along with people.
If Mars is sterile, it will make no difference; even if Martian
life exists but is confined to the deep subsurface contamination is
a remote possibility.  To most scientists, the risk-reward of
Martian exploration is still positive.
