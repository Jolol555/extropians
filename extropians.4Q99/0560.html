I have been referring to the Transhumanist Media &amp; PR Binder which is
already in existence.  On a separate note, my own material which I use for
interviews is my personal press kit.

<p>
The Binder that I am referring is a compilation of material by a number of
people and quite helpful.

Since you are sending this post to the extropian list, ExI and some
press-savvy extropains have a *lot* of Media material!  As I understand it,
Nick (WTA) and Max have been in contact about collaborative efforts.
