<a href="3000.html#3065qlink2">&gt;I may be wrong, but to me this sounds like the Western ideal of "romantic</a><br>
<i>&gt;love".  Romance is important to me, I enjoy it and want to keep it for a long</i><br>
<i>&gt;time.  Also my wife is important to me, and I want to keep her for a long</i><br>
<i>&gt;time.  While the love I have for my wife comes in many different layers, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;is one of the most important things in my life, it is not all consuming, nor</i><br>
<i>&gt;would I wish it to be.  As in all aspects of my life, I seek a healthy</i><br>
<i>&gt;balance that will be of benefit to me and my family.  You are right in that</i><br>
<i>&gt;romance can quickly fade; that is why it must be constantly renewed and</i><br>
<i>&gt;reinvented.  Mostly, it is a matter of being thoughtful and creative, both of</i><br>
<i>&gt;which I consider traits I already possess, and both of which I use for more</i><br>
<i>&gt;than just wooing my wife.</i><br>

<a name="3077qlink1">It seems to me that you are denying that the phenomena of limerence</a> is
associated with any degree of fooling oneself about anything.  More
<a name="3077qlink2">generally, you seem to deny my suggestion that people fool</a> themselves
into thinking they are more thoughtful, creative, etc. than they are.

<p>
I'm not sure I can do much here to change your mind, other than to point
you to the vast literatures on the topic.  You might start wit the word
"limerence".
