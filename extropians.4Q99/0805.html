<a name="0815qlink1">Oh ye of little faith Robert.  Looks to me like we
could defend ourselves against a hellishly determined
nuclear attack, given enough THAAD missiles and
</a>
support radar.  After all, if one THAAD can hit one
missile, and 5 THAADs can ensure hitting that one,
could not 5000 THAADs ensure knocking out 1000
incoming?

<p>
In a time when we spend a billion on one bomber,
the THAAD is a hell of a good deal.  How much
would you be willing to pay to have Seattle *not* nuked?
A few billion is cheap.  Santa Clara county has 10 billion
dollars tied up in its automobiles alone.

<p>
THAAD is a great deal, for we can produce them
in laaaaarge quantities.  Then sell them to countries all
over the world, for a modest profit of course.

<p>
Then we can sell them missiles that can defeat THAAD,
<a name="0817qlink1">for a modest profit.  Then we can sell them improved
metaTHAADs that can defeat these clever THAADdefeating
 missiles, for a modest profit.  Let us continue
thus, until the entire world, to the very last corrupt politician,
recognizes the utter madness of this situation, and finally
disassemble these ruinously expensive hellish death machines
and use the warheads to generate clean power.  When that day
comes, I will be the happiest man in the unemployment line.  spike
