<a href="1971.html#1975qlink1">&gt;IMHO, one of the big problems with any kind of mega-merger is that the</a><br>

<i>&gt;it tends to do a poor job of all of them.  This is a particularly</i><br>

<p>
Sure, dozens of concrete means.  How relevant they are is another matter :-).
But there are tons of books and articles on "orgazinzation design".  Milgrom
and Roberts have a nice text (ISBN 0-13-224650-3).

<p>
Theoretically the puzzling thing is that a merged company should in theory
still have the option of letting its two parts be managed independently.
By that argument, a merged firm couldn't do any worse; merging just creates
new options.

<p>
So if merged companies do worse, it must be due to reduced oversight from the
now merged board of directors, reduced information to analysts and speculators
about the merged firm, meddling by a CEO who has to prove his or her
worth by getting involved in what should be independent operations, a
difficulty in creating financial instruments which are the equivalent
of "stock options" on the returns from each subsidiary, or some
similar explanation.
