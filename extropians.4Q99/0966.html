<a href="0954.html#0966qlink1">&gt;  2 PM EST:  Singularity occurs, planetwide.  No fuss.  No mess.  No time</a><br>
<i>&gt;  to panic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  *That's* the way we ought to run things.</i><br>

<p>
    1:30 pm est: eliezer climbs up onto the the roof of the singularity 
institute's main building, pulls a large optic taser out of a suitcase, plugs 
it into the wall, checks the backup batteries, and sits down on an airvent to 
await... whatever.
<p>
<a name="0982qlink2">    1:55 pm est: eliezer stands on an air vent casing, looks around, for one 
last time, at the placid cityscape surrounding him,  and starts busting high 
voltage caps into the air and shouting "hey, elisson! i wanna know the 
meaning of life, the universe, and everything!!!"</a>
<p>
<a name="0982qlink3">    1:57 pm est: although elisson notices its surroundings almost 
immediately, it takes a short time for it to realize that the ant on the roof 
is its creator. its decision-making process is something vaguely like the 
following: "a monkey is discharging a monkey weapon on the roof. it might do 
something bad with that. no, there is no way it can damage me with that. this 
monkey seems to be one of my primary creators. its asking me questions. it is 
not necessary to answer its questions. cells 0x9e83fa823 through 0x9e83fc907, 
disassemble the monkey."</a>
<p>
<a name="0982qlink4">    1:58 pm est: on the roof, the wind picks up, and eliezer notices the dust 
rise from the ground like a fractal wave of soot, and opens his arms in 
welcome. elisson, like a sandblaster, embraces him. eliezer ceases to exist 
in a sheet of black razorblade snowflakes.</a>
<p>
    1:59 pm est: sayke and den otter, having observed the above proceedings 
on their nokia wearables (from their vantage point/hideout on a stolen 
russian nuclear sub; the "nebuchadnezzar"), nod to each other, and a female 
voice emotionlessly says "immanantize the escheaton?" their retinas are 
scanned, and their voices are analysed as they utter the obscure kabbalic 
incantations that are the passwords to end the world, again.
<p>
    1:59:23 pm est: a complex series of ultra-wideband pulse transmissions go 
out, and 523 high yield nuclear warheads detonate simultaneously. a majority 
of these are in low earth orbit, and the rest have been preplaced in such a 
way as to destory scanning tunneling microscopes and biotech labs wherever 
they can be found. the sonar registers concussions from all directions. the 
almost-powered-completly-down sub is unaffected.
<p>
    2:00 pm est: sayke pours himself a white russian, sits back in his 
beanbag chair, and tugs on his goatee. den otter says "i got the final code 
compile, right before it went underground. it *is* possible..." sayke replies 
"fuck yea", and sips his white russian...
