<a name="0983qlink1">I think knowledge validation is the important part, and this is where
independent review boards can get relevant.</a> OK, you are a genius and
don't need school, just go to the review board and demonstrate to them
that you have the necessary knowledge and skills to get their seal of
approval (a bit like getting your driver's licence?). There is
<a name="0983qlink2">probably a need for some standard review boards that might be
government run, but it also makes a lot of sense to have independent
boards<a name="0888qlink1"></a> ("Ok, your grades from the government board are good, but</a> they
tend to be too lax on the critical thinking section. We would like you
to have grades from one of these boards, which emphasizes more
relevant abilities."). Of course, the Kansas Board of Creationist
<a name="0983qlink3">Science might exist, but that is no real problem since it will not be
a very credible board - what really makes this system interesting is
if the boards can be reviewed and rated well.</a>
