&gt;I've been meaning to send a 'hello' to Amara Graps, so 'hi'!

<p>
(Hi!)

<p>
<a href="0221.html#0331qlink1">   &gt;I made the decision not to reenter graduate school until I could prove</a><br>
<i>   &gt;to myself a true commitment to one particular field. At the same time,</i><br>
<i>   &gt;that will not stop me from writing serious articles and books. Those</i><br>

<p>
Oh, yes! And those articles and books would already show a serious
dedication. Certainly they'll benefit you, for both your future and
your present because you're probably enjoying the process too. That's
what I did/do (I write because I have always loved my field(s), writing
helps me to learn, and I like to express it in written form.)

<p>
<a href="0221.html#0331qlink2">   &gt;And, already, you seem to have produced a body of work comparable to</a><br>
<i>   &gt;most persons who already have the Dr.!</i><br>

<p>
It looks strange, I know. The physics faculty head at the University
of Heidelberg asked me why I want or need a PhD with my papers and
experience, and  I had to try to explain (mit meiner sehren schlecten
Deutsche ...).

<p>
Why a PhD now? This is what I mean about a degree having a special
meaning if you've been in the field that you love for a while.

<p>
I need to truly know what are my abilities. I don't want to be in
any kind of safe and secure environment for my work. I want to reach as far
outside of myself as I can go and just see what are my limitations (very
useful information) and what are my strengths (even more useful information).
I want to put myself in a situation where I'm away from everything I know,
and see what I can learn about about the Universe and myself in the process.
I want to be a real expert in one area, instead of (in addition to?)
semi-knowledgeable in many areas.  And I want to give myself more
choices and options for astronomy work for the next few decades of my
life. These are the reasons I chose to get a PhD, after all of these years.

<p>
(I'm afraid I didn't explain that very well to the Dekanat, but the
University admitted me into their PhD  program anyway :-).  )

P.S. I'm actually not the oldest graduate student in our group, there's
a Swedish fellow 5 years older than I am, that has built spacecraft
experiments
<br>
for 10 years, works at a well-known ESA research center in the Netherlands
(he commutes to our group periodically), has technicians and a secretary
working for him, and has more published papers than me.

<p>
I think that sometimes there comes a time in a person's life when he/she
simply says, "OK, now it's time to do it." And you do it.
