we use land.  I flew over the US today, New York to Dallas to
San Jose.  It was clear and I spent most of my trip looking at the

how *empty* is most of this country.</a>  The population is highly
concentrated along rivers.  Look at it next time you fly over.  There
are huuuuge expanses of open land, with plenty of water, growing things
that are of no direct benefit to humans, such as scrubby non-lumber
trees.  The riverbank land is subject to flooding, whereas all that
good sloping land is nearly untouched.</a>
