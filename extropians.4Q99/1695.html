This falls into the exact pitfall of applying "our" motivations to
a state of technological development that we don't have.  When
we have that level of development, it is impossible to say what
our motivations will be.

<p>
I think the only situation that would ever arise where this might
happen in the universe is when you got two planets forming
in the same solar system within the "possible life belt".  Then the
discovery of and activity of an intelligent civilization could
influence the evolution of life on the other planet without the
requirement for interstellar travel technology.  We would need
some simulations of the formation of planetary systems to see how
probable that is.

<p>
Once you have interstellar travel you probably have nanotech and AI as well.
If so, it is questionable whether you have an interest in biosphere
engineering (other than perhaps dismantling them).  Why would you
want to do reality engineering with hardware when you can do it with
software?
