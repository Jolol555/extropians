Yes, 2.5 million annual non-violent employments of guns by law abiding
citizens for self defense purposes, while according to Newsweek, there
were around 9,000 gun deaths in the US in 1997 (August 15th issue).

<i>&gt; not be present).  You don't have problems with victims being caught unaware (even</i><br>
<i>&gt; armed cops get killed sometimes) or the problem that women tend to have of being</i><br>

<i>&gt; space in emergency rooms. You don't have to try to figure out what happened after</i><br>
&gt; the fact. And your ex-girl friend can't tear her dress, shoot you, and then claim<br>
&gt; you attempted to rape her.<br>

<p>
I've never known a criminal to be afraid of a camera. Now, a camera AND
a gun is definitely a win-win combo. I would guess that that is probably
the most non-lethal combo.
