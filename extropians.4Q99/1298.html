<i>&gt; variences of social disorders, UNLESS they have other mental symptoms as </i><br>
<i>&gt; well.</i><br>

<p>
It is not just an inability to learn social programming, it is
something deeper. After all, if they just lacked social programming
they would still act rationally in most situations, but antisocial
personality disorder implies a lack of self-control which is
irrational - it constantly puts them in trouble, trouble which would
have been obvious for normal people ("If you steal your boss' car, he
will fire you").

<a href="1281.html#1298qlink2">&gt; Classifying someone as a sociopath minimizes isolating the problem.  </a><br>
<i>&gt; Such a classification would definately indicate brain damage (putting aside </i><br>
<i>&gt; it may be the philosophy of a normal brain) and I would look toward </i><br>
<i>&gt; medication and/or surgery along with cognitive therapy. </i><br>

<p>
There are many kinds of personality disorder, and it is not obvious
how much each is based on brain pathology or bad experiences. I would
guess it is usually a mixture - a vulnerable brain gets subjected to
something that sets up a bad self-reinforcing pattern (Antisocial
<a name="1305qlink1">personality disorder actually seems to be the most biologically
well-defined personality disorder).</a> Borderline personality disorder,
histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality
disorder...<a name="1305qlink2"> Some are likely easier to treat than others, but the main
problem is of course that if you have a less-than-optimal personality
you may not realise it is bad for you ("I'm all right, it is everybody
else who are idiots!").</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; Before doing so though, I would definately MAKE SURE they lack</i><br>
<a href="1281.html#1298qlink3">&gt; ability.  How do you test someones ability, mental reflexes?</a><br>
<i>&gt; Especialy someone who's uncooperative or may be lying to you (always</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to expect that)?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1305qlink3">Usually people get treated for antisocial personality disorder because
they got caught after some crime - *they* don't consider themselves
sick in any way. There are likely plenty of antisocial people out
there who are not ill enough to get forced into treatment but remain
ill enough to mess up their own and others lives.</a>
