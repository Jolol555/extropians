I agree that such technology could be used this way.  The question is:
how well will such creatures compete with those differently constituted?

<p>
We evolved to be happy sometimes and unhappy other times because this was
functional in our ancestral environment.  Our unhappiness, for example,
was often used as a clue to consider trying things differently.  If you
just make people happy in a crude way, you could disturb these feedback
loops to their disadvantage.

<p>
On the other hand, it is possible that groups of happily subservient
creatures will be competitive with others.  That may offend your 20th
century sensibilities, but the universe need not care.
