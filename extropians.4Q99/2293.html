You'll find them hard at work on the sci.skeptic, sci.astro, alt.origins and 
alt.atheist newsgroups.  Not much energy left for us.

It is only a matter of time before transhumanism and extropianism is taken 
up as a target for evangelical criticism, mark my words.  In time there will 
be at least several evangelical websites that will have articles denouncing 
transhumanism.

<p>
I am a Mormon and I can tell you a huge amount of energy goes toward 
debating my church.  Of course with the strong Mormon missionary effort this 
is seen as a means of dealing with it.  Video programs and books are also 
regularly cranked out in this effort.  This is done out of a desire in their 
eyes to do what is right I believe but also a great deal of money is 
</a>
generated doing this.

<p>
Evangelicals like to find new pastures to criticize and so it is just a 
matter of time till extropianism is targeted.  Expect to be discussed on the 
Bob Larson show, the LaLonde Brothers tv program, the John Ankerberg tv 
program, Jeremiah films as well as by others.  These programs will be 
broadcast nation and even world-wide on a regular basis.  And in time, Hal 
Lindsey, the LaLonde brothers, Dave Hunt and others will be writing books 
about extropianism and transhumanism that will sell many copies, believe me.

<p>
The Extropian Institute will probably be focused on since in is a formal 
organization with some interesting individuals in it.  I am sure these shows 
and books will single out Max and Natasha.  Down the road I expect extropian 
leaders being invited to debates on these evangelical programs which will 
later be broadcast nationally and also sold to the viewership.

<p>
I believe the motives of these evangelicals in the mass media to be largely 
sincere actually.  They feel compelled to bring to the notice of the 
membership anything against their paradigm so they can refute it.  A 
comparison will be made of extropianism against evangelical interpretations 
of the Bible to show where transhumanism differs and thereby is clearly 
wrong and so wicked in their view.

<p>
<a name="2424qlink2">Ironically, this entire effort of theirs will lead to far greater exposure 
<a name="2309qlink1">of extropianism.  It could even backfire in that some adults</a> and expecially 
</a>
<a name="2309qlink2">teens may find themselves attracted to transhumanism.  But on the whole it 
will have a uniting effect on the flock which is a major desired effect of 
such endeavors.

<p>
It is just a matter of time for these events to happen.  It should be very 
interesting to watch them play out.
</a>

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
