               Mars Polar Lander Mission Status
                      November 8, 1999

     Engineers say they are close to resolving a potential 
</pre>
problem on NASA's Mars Polar Lander uncovered by the NASA panel 
appointed to investigate the recent loss of the Mars Climate 
Orbiter.

<p>
     The NASA investigation board, chaired by Art Stephenson, 
director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, 
Ala., found that cold temperatures could affect the performance 
Mars Polar Lander's descent engine, which begins firing at about 
2 kilometers (about 1 = miles) altitude during the descent to 
Mars surface.  As a result of the finding, a team of engineers at 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.,  has 
developed procedures to warm up the engine system prior to 
firing.  In addition, the team has analyzed descent engine 
performance at a range of temperatures to assess its predicted 
performance upon arrival.

<p>
     Updated operations plans call for turning on propellant 
system heaters several hours prior to the spacecraft's entry into 
Mars' atmosphere.  This strategy will increase the expected 
temperature of the descent engines to 8 degrees Celsius (46.4 
degrees Fahrenheit).  Analysis indicates that at this 
temperature, the engines will perform as designed.  

<p>
     Ground-based testing of an actual descent engine was 
conducted last week at the descent engine manufacturer's test 
facility.  The initial test results suggest acceptable engine 
start-up performance is achieved when the catalyst bed, where 
engine firing initiates, is at temperatures as low as -20 degrees 
Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).  More ground-based test firings 
are scheduled to better characterize engine performance at 
various temperatures.

<p>
     On Wed., Nov. 10, NASA will release the investigation board 
findings on the loss of Mars Climate Orbiter and recommendations 
for the Mars Polar Lander mission, which lands on Mars Dec. 3.  

<p>
     Mars Polar Lander successfully performed its third course 
correction on Oct. 30, and another maneuver to fine-tune the 
flight path is scheduled for Nov. 30.  The spacecraft remains in 
good health.

<p>
     On Nov. 1, the spacecraft's landing radar system was turned 
on for the first time since launch and successfully performed its 
internal self-test. Test results show the unit's integrity is 
sound, and all electrical functional test results were within the 
expected range. The landing radar will not be turned on again 
until landing day. The radar system is activated just after 
separation of the lander's heat shield, following parachute 
deployment, and begins searching for the surface. Once the system 
recognizes the Martian surface, it must generate data for 
approximately 60 seconds, providing altitude and velocity 
measurements to the spacecraft's onboard guidance system for 
powered descent.
 
<p>
     Mars Climate Orbiter was lost as it was entering orbit 
around Mars on Sept. 23.  The orbiter and lander are part of a 
series of missions in a long-term program of Mars exploration 
managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of 
Space Science, Washington, D.C.  JPL's industrial partner is 
Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Denver, Colo.  JPL is a division of 
the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.
