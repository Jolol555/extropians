<p>
When you split a hologram into any number of smaller units, you get a
degradation of the original hologram.  I suppose you could liken</a> it to "line
noise".</a>  My college entrance essay was on this topic, actually... at least,
how the idea was presented in "The Holographic Universe" (by Michael Talbot,
I believe).

<p>
More to come later, perhaps.

Subject: Holography


<p>
      I've been playing around with an idea for a
little bit, though I haven't had the time to put any
real look into the feasibility...
<pre>
      It goes something like this:
      If you had a really good holographic data storage
</pre>
system (one functionally as good or better in every
respect as any modern memory storage) would it be
possible to network the holographic matrix?</a>  My
thoughts being something like, "since when you split a
hologram in two, you get two holograms, what if you
had a bunch of networked computers forming a single
holographic memory between them... so that when one
computer crashed, the network as a whole retains the
data... so none of the data is lost, only the
hardware."
<p>
    However, upon considering the subject I realised I
didn't have the slightest idea where to begin... I've
started reading about holography and computer
networks, but I was hoping that by putting this idea
out here I'd encourage some sort of interesting
feedback- or at least information as to why it
wouldn't be feasible, were this the case...
<p>
    Anyways, it has a lot of applications- for example,
we talk about uploading on the list a lot. If the
computer that contains an uploaded personality
crashes... what then?  Well, with some sort of
holographic system, a stabler form of uploading could
exist- one with less risk of destruction in the case
of some disaster.
<p>
     Any thoughts on how this might slow down existing
networks, how modifications to programs might be made
in a holographic system... actually, just about
anything at all relating to this might be interesting.
