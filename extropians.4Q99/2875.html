<a name="2886qlink1">Look, I was going to write about this earlier, but I feel like I can't
help but mention something about it now.  If homosexuality was some
recessive trait which was advantageous in the heterozygous form, we'd be
seeing a LOT more homosexuality than we actually do.  "1 in 4, maybe more"
would be true everywhere, all across the world, and bluntly, it's just
not.  It would surprise me a Great Deal if some kind of "gay gene" were
ever found that provided some heterozygous advantage.</a>

<p>
Homosexuality is no better nor worse morally than being heterosexual. But
you're fooling yourself if you think that homosexuality provides some
GENETIC advantage.  That's not the point; never was, never will be.
