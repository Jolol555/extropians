&gt;&gt; I think the original remark misses the depth of Church-Turing. It's
&gt;&gt; not just talking about what you can do with a computer, it's talking
&gt;&gt; about what you can do with _any conceivable_ formal system. If you can
&gt;&gt; find expressible regularities in the universe which can't be described
&gt;&gt; under the lambda calculus then you've disproven the conjecture.

<a href="1352.html#1362qlink2">&gt; With all due respect, I do *not* "miss the depth" of things like</a><br>
<i>&gt; Church-Turing-Tarski.  I believe the Church-Turing-Tarski thesis is</i><br>
<i>&gt; false and will be disproved.  I believe there are expressible</i><br>

<i>&gt; necessity, not a coincidence.</i><br>

<p>
Ok - then I understand your position but none of the reasoning behind it.

<p>
<i>&gt; And, for the record, I believe that the Church-Turing-Tarski thesis</i><br>
<a href="1352.html#1362qlink3">&gt; is fundamentally *wrong*, not just limited in the space of phenomena</a><br>
<i>&gt; it describes; there is *no such thing* as a simulation; it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to "compute" the complete behavior of a quark without</i><br>
<i>&gt; creating an actual quark.</i><br>

<p>
Then you believe that a quark has properties which it is not possible
to describe computationally. To some extent, I agree. A piece of paper
with a mass, position, and velocity written on it is not a particle,
it's still just a piece of paper. Only simulated people get wet in
simulated rainstorms.

<p>
<a href="1352.html#1362qlink4">&gt; I don't know that a genius-in-a-box that naturally evolved in a Life</a><br>
<i>&gt; universe could deduce that it was in a simulation, but I know it could</i><br>
<i>&gt; deduce that it wasn't looking at the lowest level of reality.</i><br>

<p>
What suggests to you that no reality may ever be computable or that
Turing equivalence proves the world is a simulation?
