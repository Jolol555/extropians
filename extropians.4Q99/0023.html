Mike, please note that Spike said "murderers and rapists".
Those crimes are crimes of violence against people.
I started the thread with the assumption that analysis of
the criminal DNA database(s), could yield the presence of genes
that may be significantly different from the average person
in the population (let us call these violence predisposition genes).

<p>
This thread is about the fundamental questions of is there such
a thing as innate (bio-defective) induced violence or even a
predisposition for such tendencies.  Further it is about whether
correcting those predispositions would be a "good" or a "bad" thing.

<p>
Do you have a "right" to be violent and hurt people?
Do you say, it is ok to let the blind people stay blind or
the deaf people stay deaf, but *not* to let the violent people
stay violent?

<p>
To make sure the thread doesn't get polluted --
  THIS THREAD IS ABOUT A HYPOTHETICAL UNIVERSE IN WHICH
  GUNPOWDER DOESN'T EXPLODE AND PROJECTILE WEAPONS HAVEN'T
  BEEN INVENTED.

<p>
So, say we have a person with violence predisposition genes
who *also* happens to be a martial arts master.  Should I
have to spend years of my life studying martial arts just
so I can defend myself against this person who may assault
me for no reason other than the fact that I've got a red
car and s/he hates the color red?  Should not the members of
the society be able to band together and collectively say --
"This person is a threat to the peace and prosperity of
our community and as a result their violence predisposition
must be corrected".

<p>
If you legally *mandate* correcting violent tendences (or as
was suggested, perhaps somebody's stupidity), doesn't that put
you on the slippery slope for *mandating* the correction of
anything the majority views as "unacceptable".

<p>
You can argue that there may be strong influences on the genetic
makeup by government, society, etc. but we are fundamentally talking
about people "programmed" (through no choice of their own) to have
predispositions that express themselves as violence against society.

<p>
Now, your point may be well taken in that if one does agree that
correcting violence predispositions is allowable (just as we agree
that imprisonment or in some cases execution is allowable), then we
had better be *very* careful about using hard scientific evidence
that that is really the case.

<p>
Robert
