 Right now we tend to be a bunch of lazy biological animals. 


<p>
Speak for yourself, you animal!!! ; - ) 

<p>
&gt;&gt; A billion<br>
<br>
 years of evolution has ingrained in us a predilection for conserving
 energy between meals and enjoying relaxation.  Modern cultural
 programming is mostly in favor of the opposite - work like hell and get
 ahead.  Hence civilization's discontent. 
 
<p>
This is true, but only because a small segment of mankind is privileged 
enough to enjoy the ennui of not having anything to do and hating it.  
Discontent comes more from lack of ability to rest when we are weary and 
confused (yes biological enhancement will make rest a thing of the past, 
confusion ... maybe), not some biological desire to sit around on our arses. 


<p>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;When it is possible for me to thoroughly re-enigneer my wants and
 desires, I might choose to do away with the "rest and relaxation =
 pleasure" response altogether and replace it with an unchecked
 preference for growth and extension of myself.   Then I could have the
 best of both worlds - continuous advancement and constant pleasure.
  &gt;&gt;

<p>
Desiring to reprogram your wants and desires is an odd thing to desire, will 
you reprogram the desire to reprogram yourself? ; )
Seriously:
<br>
IMO, some of the reason sleep and relaxation are valuable is the need to 
"process" and evaluate information. A need for unfocused thought will still 
be desirable, even if it is not absolutely necessary, for the simple reason 
that our best moments come when we are unfocused. Thinking... Musing... 
Drifting.... Sometimes known as "inspiration." Take that away you'll be 
little more than a chipmunk on a wheel.
