<a href="0831.html#0838qlink1">&gt;The human body was improved by eliminating such vestigial, useless, and </a><br>
<i>&gt;sometimes harmful items as the appendix, tonsils, [and] wisdom teeth....</i><br>

<p>
It has been well-established for decades that the appendix and tonsils are
neither vestigial nor useless.  They perform important physiological
functions, none of which I remember just now.  But I did read that people
who've had their tonsils out have a higher rate of some cancers than
people with haven't.  On the other hand, if you have them removed, they 
give you lots of ice cream.  And everybody likes ice cream.

<p>
I'm already a mutant myself, having never had wisdom teeth.  (I can also
wiggle my ears!)

<p>
Other than this, Karl Jahn is completely right, of course.
