Invitrogen Launches Revolutionary New Cloning Product; Echo Cloning
System Enables Fast, Reliable Cloning Into Multiple Expression
Systems



<p>
     SAN DIEGO, Dec. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Invitrogen Corporation (Nasdaq:
IVGN)
<br>
today introduced the Echo(TM) Cloning System, which makes possible fast
and
<br>
reliable cloning of any gene into multiple expression vectors.  The Echo

<p>
System dramatically reduces the time and effort associated with cloning
DNA
<br>
for expression analysis, speeding the drug research and discovery
process.
<p>
     The first commercially available system of its kind, the Echo System

<p>
brings Invitrogen's highly-efficient TOPO(R) Cloning technology and its
advanced expression systems together with a novel univector
plasmid-fusion
<br>
system developed by Stephen J. Elledge, Ph.D., professor of biochemistry
at
<br>
Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.  Baylor will be paid a royalty
under a
<br>
license agreement with Invitrogen.
<p>
     "Echo Cloning makes obsolete the need for traditional subcloning, a<br>
troublesome, time-consuming step in gene expression and analysis," said
Lyle
<br>
Turner, Chairman and CEO of Invitrogen.  "Using Invitrogen's efficient
TOPO
<br>
Cloning technology, scientists now need to clone and sequence a
construct only
<br>
once.  The clone is then recombined or 'echoed' into other expression
vectors
<br>
-- ranging from bacterial to mammalian cells -- simultaneously.  The
process
<br>
works on any gene and can be automated, providing a tremendous time
saver for
<br>
researchers."
<p>
     The Echo System can be used by any scientist who wants to accelerate
the
<br>
cloning process, according to Turner, but could prove especially
valuable for
<br>
high-volume users such as pharmaceutical companies and large research
foundations who can use the system to facilitate high-throughout gene
cloning
<br>
and reduce the time and costs associated with identifying and validating
new
<br>
drug targets and developing new therapeutics.
<p>
     "The Echo System expands the high-throughput cloning product and<br>
service
<br>
offerings of our Invitrogenomics program by adding high-throughput
subcloning
<br>
and expression analysis, further accelerating target identification and
validation," Turner said.
<p>
     "Last week, landmark results of the Human Genome Project were<br>
announced
<br>
with the completion of the sequencing of human chromosome 22," said
Turner.
<br>
"This significant development marks just the beginning of the research
that
<br>
will need to be done.  The genes that are identified from this
chromosome and
<br>
subsequent structural analysis of chromosomes will provide scientists
with the
<br>
knowledge of the gene sequence.  Broad, new functional studies will now
need
<br>
to be mounted to find out what these genes can do individually, and the
Echo
<br>
System will allow scientists to quickly clone and express these genes
into
<br>
multiple host systems and make proteins for experimentation.  A process
that
<br>
was previously slow and unreliable now becomes quick and accurate thanks
to
<br>
the new Echo System."
<p>
     Invitrogen's TOPO Cloning is used in functional genomics research
and
<br>
gene-based drug discovery and has become the dominant PCR (Polymerase
Chain
<br>
Reaction) cloning technique among researchers worldwide.  Invitrogen
holds
<br>
exclusive worldwide commercial rights to the TOPO Cloning patent,
granted to
<br>
the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, for the life of the
patent,
<br>
which expires in 2015.
<p>
     "We are giving our customers the power of TOPO at the first step in<br>
the
<br>
cloning process," said Turner, "and with the addition of Echo Cloning,
plasmid
<br>
fusions can be quickly prepared for expression in Invitrogen's
expression
<br>
systems or any other expression system being used by the customer."
