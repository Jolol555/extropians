<a href="0597.html#0609qlink1">&gt;The Standard Diagnostic Nomenclature of the American Psychiatric</a><br>
<i>&gt;Association includes in its description of "sociopathy" "the inability</i><br>
<i>&gt;to experience shame or guilt" and "the absence of internalized</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;ethical or moral standards of conduct", i.e. conscience, and in</i><br>
<i>&gt;general "displays an amorphous hostile disregard of society".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

I remember looking up the term 'sociopath' in an introductory psychology
book and finding a similar defintion.<a name="0612qlink1"> The only significant difference I
recall between the definition I read, and the one you cite, is that the one
I read claimed that sociopaths disregard traditional ethical and moral
standards in favor of morality of their own invention which suits their own
needs. It also mentioned an experiment in which a sociopath is given a brief
electric shock, and told that in 5 minutes they will recieve another one.
Their stress responses were measured during those 5 minutes of waiting, and
were found to be much lower then the control group of non-sociopaths.
I was somewhat surprised that this is regarded as a form of mental
deficiency.</a> I have since aspired to become a sociopath.
<a name="0612qlink2"><a name="0610qlink1">The only thing I can't figure out is why so many sociopaths lack
responsibility, and a respect for the rights of others (i.e. why they often
end up becomming mass murderers).</a> As an aspiring sociopath, I haven't had
any problem resisting the urge to murder or rob from people. Would any
responsible sociopaths like to comment on this?</a>
