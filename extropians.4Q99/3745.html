I would say that is simply important to consider the promises and threats of "AI in
the wild."  Perhaps one of these is that as any AI grows in power its monitoring and
possible circumspection must be accordingly increased.  Also, it must have it
possible venues, whether that is its ANSI terminal output or anything on a TCP/IP
net, checked if it might to exploit these outputs into the concrete real world to
rain destruction upon humanity.  All these things are largely done the same way any
person would be treated.

<p>
If we apply some multiplier to measure some artificial intelligence's ability on a
human scale, for example n, does that mean the AI has an IQ of n*100 or that it can
think as fast as n average people?  What does being 10 or 20 times smarter than a
human mean anyways?  Cataloging data is not intelligence, although some level of
knowledge is necessary for applied intelligence.  I am aware that there are many ways
to describe and quantify intelligence, and that it is a multi-faceted attribute.
Certainly a dumb silicon processor can perform preprogrammed calculations at a
superhuman rate of speed.

<p>
So, if there are automated mechanisms that offer large-scale destruction or
subornation of humanity, then in any case where some AI is deteremined to exist, it
must be made sure that access controls apply to it as it would to any human.  That
is, while the AI might be able to argue that it should be let out of its box, perhaps
in its view rightly, and into the "wild", it might be necessary to not necessarily
allow it to get in, there being sensitive areas.

<p>
In this vein, I think of some way that there could be the stoppage of some AI that is
determined to be bad for humanity, not that I am saying that they do or will exist.
We might consider simply, and quite basically, stopping its program or main and all
"threads of execution."  In a distributed sense, this might be more difficult, and
would require an ability for it to be stopped on all participating machines.  On some
unknown computer architecture such as some kind of quantum parallel, like grey
matter, this process might be different and require some more extreme measures to
halt its processing..

<p>
It's better to think of all the good things that an AI could provide, especially one
that is shown the logic of its silicon existence and obligation to its human
forebears, and perhaps satisfaction in a job dispatched to the abovementioned dumb
silicon processor.

<p>
It's a question whether any plurality of advanced AIs would merge, or if that any
communication between them would make them more homogenous.  I guess this would
depend on their learning architecture.  If the AIs merged, then it would still be one
AI against many different humans.  When an AI is advanced enough to make its own
independent AIs, this all being determined by the definition of an AI which is
amorphous in the first place, that would be something.

<p>
Well, I have started to ramble about AIs, thus will conclude.  Have a nice day,
