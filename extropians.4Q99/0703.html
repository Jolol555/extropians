Ah, I had images of deaf mutes being locked in basements by
cruel parents.

<p>
I've often wondered how 'hardwired' this ability is.  Try
looking at a photograph of a person and then mimicking their
facial expression/posture; it tends to effect your emotional
state.  You'll often see a person mimic the facial
expressions of a friend who is suffering emotional trauma
(or simply laughing).  So I'm thinking the links between
emotion and expression are two-way, emotion causes
expression but expression also causes emotion.  This would
mean there's no need to recognise specific patterns (eg, the
ability to recognise pain and pleasure is not hardcoded).</a>

<p>
Perhaps the most obvious pressure is to extend ability,
gesturing for someone to pass the chicken.  And, of course,
telling people to run for their lives.

<p>
The story's obvious - brains will be similar enough to screw
up every concept of individuality with have, but different
enough to make memory transfer a real challenge.

My guess would be a headache.

<p>
In that case I'm going back to bed, I can get those 'did
something useful' memories later.

[I've spent the day using Windows 2000 Beta 3 and managed to
keep myself amused for several hours watching the menus fade
in and out, so I have been productive after all.]
