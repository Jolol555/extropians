<a href="0497.html#0536qlink1">    &gt;I have found it useful to engage the anti-science/pro-religious crowd in</a><br>
<i>    &gt;a non-threatening way explaining the beauty and efficacy of evolutionary</i><br>
theory.

<p>
I've tried that too but it only works when I'm less than candid and try to use
than old line about religion and Science living in harmony, when I'm more
honest I just make people unhappy and mad. I've learned how to keep
my mouth shut around religious people as long as they don't try to convert me.

<p>
The sad truth is that the Bible thumpers are right about one thing, religion and
evolution are incompatible. Evolution is not efficient, it took nearly 4 billion
years
<br>
to produce us. I don't know how long it will take mind (us) to produce an AI but
I know it will be less than 4 billion years, probably less than a century,
perhaps
<br>
much less. Evolution has made some beautiful things but the process itself is
not beautiful, in fact its cruelty is astronomical, for every tiny advance
millions
<br>
die horrible deaths.<a name="0543qlink1"> The religious correctly conclude that if Evolution is true
and God exists then He's a sadistic monster.</a> They only abandon logic when
they pick the answer that is most comforting, Evolution is wrong, rather than
the correct conclusion that God is nonexistent or evil.
