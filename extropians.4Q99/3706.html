This month, WIRED magazine has gone over the top in promoting an extropian 
view of the future.  The January 2000 issue is entitled "The Future Gets Fun 
Again" and is chock full of positive views of the future informed by 
extropian ideas and values.  The main article on biotech, "Don't Die, Stay 
Pretty" uses the author's coverage of EXTRO4 as the centerpiece of material 
that includes quotes from Max and Natasha and begins with Robert Bradbury's â€¦ 
energetic ... questioning of panelists during one of his sessions at the 
conference.  Gina Miller also gets a shot in, in a sidebar in an article on 
<br>
"future sex".  Check it out.<br>

        "We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know 
        enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another    
       question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species."
                                           -- Desmond Morris
