 well, to develop huge artificial life simulations/universes, explore the 
Earth
<br>
 and the universe, teach and interact with children, compose grand
 symphonies, invent better ways to think and perceive the world, cook and
 eat delicious food, gather information into useful patterns, dedicate myself
 to studies in the occult, medicine, theoretical physics, nanotechnology 
and...

 where skills, experiences and ideas could flow freely, then I could do
 everything (well, almost everything; I would have to wait for the Far Edge
 Party..." &gt;&gt;
