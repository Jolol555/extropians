The great beyond

<p>
Our Universe could be an island marooned in five-dimensional space

<p>
SPACE may have a fifth dimension--one more than the four we are familiar 
with, say two physicists. And it could be infinite, unlike the tiny extra 
space dimensions that have been proposed in the past. 

<p>
"Incredibly, it could have gone completely unnoticed until now," says Raman 
Sundrum of Stanford University in California. Physicists take extra 
dimensions seriously because superstring theory, the best candidate for a 
"theory of everything", requires at least nine space dimensions. 

<p>
"There are two ways the extra dimensions could conceal themselves from view," 
says Sundrum. "One is if they are rolled up far smaller than an atom. The 
other is if the Universe is confined to a kind of lower-dimensional island 
within higher-dimensional space." An infinitely thin two-dimensional piece of 
paper would form such an island within normal 3D space. 

<p>
This latter possibility has now been explored by Sundrum and his colleague 
Lisa Randall of Princeton University, New Jersey. Remarkably, superstring 
theory requires lower-dimensional islands, or "branes". And in superstring 
theory, nature's three non-gravitational forces--the electromagnetic, weak 
and strong forces--can be naturally constrained to operate only within a 
brane. Gravity is a problem, however. "Gravity is intimately connected with 
the dynamics of space-time and so necessarily extends into all extra 
dimensions," says Sundrum. 

<p>
Gravity from bodies such as the Sun should theoretically spread into this 
large extra space dimension, effectively diluting it within our Universe's 
brane. "It would weaken with distance far faster than the inverse-square law 
decline that we observe," says Sundrum. 

<p>
But Sundrum and Randall have discovered this may not be so. "The key is the 
gravity of the brane itself, which is enormous," says Sundrum. 

<p>
Gravity pulls on all sources of energy, including the energy contained in a 
gravitational field. "Consequently, the gravity of the brane pulls on the 
gravity of objects like the Sun, preventing it from extending very far beyond 
the brane," says Sundrum. 

<p>
Crucially, with gravity confined to the brane, the force is undiluted and 
displays the familiar inverse-square law. And the mechanism for confining 
gravity works no matter how big the extra space dimension. 

<p>
"What's so amazing is that the theory mimics familiar four-dimensional 
gravity so well that it would be very difficult to tell that there is an 
extra dimension," says Randall.
