Any Vorlon who tries that interrogation routine on me is going to be
forcibly reminded that he isn't bulletproof.  Unlike Delen, I'm not silly
enough to worship a race that has had technology for a million years and
hasn't managed to do anything</a> with it.

<a name="2258qlink1">'Cost' and 'Value are two very different quantities.</a>  The cost of producing
something is proportional to the total human effort that was required to
make it.  The market value of the same item is a completely different thing,
and it is influenced by all sorts of other factors (as you correctly point
out).<a name="2258qlink2">  The two quantities are related only in the obvious sense that
products whose cost is higher than their value will not be produced.</a>

<p>
Perhaps I should use the term 'Production Cost' instead?
