I find it hard to believe that a very intelligent, unethical and 
power-hungry individual would be contented by playing "Civilization XXV, the 
VR edition!"  Of course that individual could be very dangerous and that is 
why there would need to be checks and balances in society to keep people 
like him or her from hurting others.

<p>
You mentioned vast powers that would deal with this threat and the problem 
is that a very intelligent, driven and unethical individual might easily be 
drawn to join the organizations that are to protect society. As they rise in 
status people like this look to bend or break the rules with others like 
themselves.  With the technologies that will come available with A.I. and 
nanotech it will be more important then ever before to stop individuals like 
this.

<p>
Of course, with checks and balances and internal policing agencies the hope 
is that a would-be tyrant could be stopped before they got to a position of 
great power.  The incredible technologies we discuss on this list such as 
A.I. and nanotech will make the pursuit of human rights even more 
challenging.


<p>
best regards,

<p>
