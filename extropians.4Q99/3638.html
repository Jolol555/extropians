<p>
Sooner rather than later, please.  Before I'd finished the first
chapter, I promised myself I'd re-read it.  Has anyone else read it? 
Comments?

This lurking Canuck is finding this list, his most enjoyable distraction
lately.

<i>&gt; Subject: Holography</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       I've been playing around with an idea for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; little bit, though I haven't had the time to put any</i><br>
<i>&gt; real look into the feasibility...</i><br>
<i>&gt;       It goes something like this:</i><br>
<i>&gt;       If you had a really good holographic data storage</i><br>
<i>&gt; system (one functionally as good or better in every</i><br>
<i>&gt; respect as any modern memory storage) would it be</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to network the holographic matrix?  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; thoughts being something like, "since when you split a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hologram in two, you get two holograms, what if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; had a bunch of networked computers forming a single</i><br>
<i>&gt; holographic memory between them... so that when one</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer crashed, the network as a whole retains the</i><br>
<i>&gt; data... so none of the data is lost, only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardware."</i><br>
<i>&gt;     However, upon considering the subject I realised I</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't have the slightest idea where to begin... I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; started reading about holography and computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; networks, but I was hoping that by putting this idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; out here I'd encourage some sort of interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; feedback- or at least information as to why it</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't be feasible, were this the case...</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Anyways, it has a lot of applications- for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we talk about uploading on the list a lot. If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer that contains an uploaded personality</i><br>
<i>&gt; crashes... what then?  Well, with some sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; holographic system, a stabler form of uploading could</i><br>
<i>&gt; exist- one with less risk of destruction in the case</i><br>
<i>&gt; of some disaster.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Any thoughts on how this might slow down existing</i><br>
<i>&gt; networks, how modifications to programs might be made</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a holographic system... actually, just about</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything at all relating to this might be interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                       -Skye</i><br>
