<a name="0618qlink1">Your definition of sociopath (below) is a more accurate one, and one which
distinguishes it from 'indivisualist', which an introductory psychology
book, or a folk-definition, fails to do. What I'll ask you now is, do you
consider someone who is self-centered, egotistical, and selfish, yet
respectful of the rights of others (does not kill, steal, rape, or lie to
attain his ends), to be a sociopath? I am asking this in regard to your
first usage</a> of the word - I forget your exact words (maybe you can re-post
them), but it was something like "only a sociopath would need every action
to directly benefit him" (I know this is way off - but I think I got the
gist of it). Perhaps you were just using the term metaphorically?

<a href="0612.html#0614qlink1">&gt;No sociopath (or "psychopath" -- a term in disfavor) ever believes he has</a><br>
<i>&gt;done anything "wrong" and, in an almost autistic way, simply can't under-</i><br>
<i>&gt;stand why everyone is making such a fuss.  This is quite consistent with</i><br>
<i>&gt;a primitive, solipsistic "morality" which is nothing but an unquestioning</i><br>
<i>&gt;implementation of any need without reservation,  generalizations from</i><br>
<i>&gt;relevant prior experience, or predictions of probable future consequences.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some people have indeed decided this disorder is essentially a learning</i><br>
<i>&gt;disability, and who therefore believe that the "moral" self-regulation of</i><br>
the
<br>
<a href="0612.html#0614qlink2">&gt;process of decision-making is nothing but learned behavior.  It is not even</a><br>
<i>&gt;clear that this person conceptualizes alternatives when experiencing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;pressure to act.</i><br>

<a href="0612.html#0614qlink3">&gt;The absence of frustration-tolerance with respect especially to aggressive</a><br>
<i>&gt;(they do learn bladder and bowel control) impulses, and their solipsistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;or schizoform isolation of affect and volition from their social</i><br>
environment,
<br>
<a href="0612.html#0614qlink4">&gt;as discussed above, makes this condition exactly what you would expect.</a><br>
<i>&gt;"Responsibility", "rights", "obligations" and identification with "real"</i><br>
others

<a href="0612.html#0614qlink5">&gt;(we call it "empathy") are simply concepts and processes which have no</a><br>
