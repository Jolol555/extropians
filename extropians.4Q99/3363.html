I saw the movie Saturday, and it was good in being pretty funny, though
rather weak on plot.  I agree that this may not be a "fair" description
of immortality, but I do think it is what most people have in mind when
they reject it, and most people do seem to reject it.  If you want to
persuade them otherwise, your challenge is to come up with a story that is
just as emotionally compelling, and yet has characters choosing immorality.
I have unfortunately not yet seen such a story (even though I favor
immortality).
