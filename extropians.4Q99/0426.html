Of course.  I was proposing to increase their mental capabilities to the point where
they had the ability to sympathize with others.  This would have the side effect of
increasing their IQ.  This is much better than getting rid of all their violent
tendencies and making sheep out of them.  In order to be a normal human being, some
violent tendencies are required.

Exactly, we need to get rid of these mental deficiencies.

Most of these types of people manage to get their act together in their 30's.
Pointing to the idea that these people are simply slow to mature.
