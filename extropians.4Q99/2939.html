No,  At least the way I've seen these words used in the past.  David Brin 
uses the term "uplifting" in his books to mean biologically enhancing the 
intelligence (and possibly other characteristics) of existing species.  Of 
course, "uploading" means reproducing a mind in a (usually non-biological) 
substrate different from the biolgical one in which it originally formed.  Of 
course, the terms could be used in combination and retain this sense, since 
one could upload and then uplift.

(BTW, I've missed some of the posts in this thread, so someone else may have 
already pointed this out)
