Me too.  The dual threat of anti-missiles and directed energy weapons gives
agressors conflicting design goals: you need a light, maneuverable reentry
vehicle with significant fuel tankage to dodge anti-missiles; and a heavy,
armored hulk to surive laser fire.  Trying to meet both goals at once isn't
going to work very well.

I wasn't around back then, but I know.

<p>
However, I didn't say that the end of MAD was an entirely good thing.  If
agressive regimes can actually survive using their nukes, some of them will
try it.
