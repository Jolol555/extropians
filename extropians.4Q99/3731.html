I heard of this one experiment - it was very interesting. It involved a
species of monkey (I forget exactly what species) which is very hierarchy
driven. There is one monkey, male, who is the top monkey, and nobody fucks
with him. He is the only monkey who gets to mate with the females, and he
has a special rock that he sits on that no other monkey dares approach. They
took a group of these monkeys, and removed the top monkey from the group.
They placed him in a room which was separated from the rerst of the group by
a one way mirror. He could see the rest of the monkeys, but they couldn't
see him. He watched while the weakest monkets of the group mated with his
<a name="3734qlink1">favorite females and sat on top of his rock. He went nuts - making that
insane screaming monkey sound, running in circles. The other monkeys were of
course unaware that he was watching. The experimenters took before and after
blood tests of the top monkey, and various hormonal levels dropped
significantly after the experiement. I wish I knew what happened after he
was re-introduced back into the group.</a>
