<a name="3148qlink1"><a name="3131qlink1">I just received this from Brian Hanish:  thought it ought to be passed on.  
Don't know if it's real yet.  Brian is usually pretty reliable.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;CNN has reported that within the next two weeks Congress is going</a> to vote </i><br>
<a name="3131qlink2"><i>&gt;on &gt;allowing telephone companies to CHARGE A TOLL FEE for Internet access. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Translation: Every time we send a long distance e-mail we will receive </i><br>
<i>&gt;a long &gt;distance charge. This will get costly. Please visit the following </i><br>
<i>&gt;web</i><br>
<br>
site
<br>
<i>&gt;and &gt;file a complaint to your Congressperson.  We can't allow this</a> to pass!</i><br>
The
<br>
<a name="3131qlink3"><i>&gt; &gt;following address will allow you tosend an e-mail on this subject</i><br>
DIRECTLY
<br>
<i>&gt;to &gt;your Congressperson. <a href="http://www.house.gov/writerep">http://www.house.gov/writerep</a> &gt; &gt;Pass this on to </i><br>
<i>&gt;your friends. It is urgent! I hope all of you will pass this on &gt;to all </i><br>
<i>&gt;your friends and family.  We should ALL have an interest in this one. &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;WAIT, THERE'S MORE! IN ADDITION, The last few months have revealed an </i><br>
<i>&gt;alarming &gt;trend in the Government of the United States attempting to </i><br>
<i>&gt;quietly push through &gt;legislation that will affect your use of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Internet.  Under proposed &gt;legislation the U.S. Postal Service will be </i><br>
<i>&gt;attempting to bilk email</i><br>
<br>
users
<br>
<i>&gt;out &gt;of "alternate postage fees".  Bill 602P will permit the Federal Govt. </i><br>
<i>&gt;to charge &gt;a 5 cent surcharge on every email delivered, by billing Internet </i><br>
</a>
<a name="3131qlink4"><i>&gt;Service &gt;Providers at source. The consumer would then be billed in turn by </i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<br>
ISP.
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Washington D.C. lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent</i><br>
this
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;legislation from becoming law. The U.S. Postal Service is claiming that </i><br>
<i>&gt;lost &gt;revenue due to the proliferation of e-mail costing nearly </i><br>
<i>&gt;$230,000,000 in &gt;revenue per year.  (Oh, isn't that too bad?) You may have </i><br>
<i>&gt;noticed their recent &gt;ad campaign "There is nothing like a letter". Since </i><br>
<i>&gt;the average citizen received &gt;about 10 pieces of email per day in 1998, the </i><br>
</a>
<a name="3131qlink5"><i>&gt;cost to the typical individual &gt;would be an additional 50 cents per day, or </i><br>
</a>
<a name="3131qlink6"><i>&gt;over $180 dollars per year, above &gt;and beyond their regular Internet costs. </i><br>
</a>
<a name="3131qlink7"><i>&gt;  Note that this would be money paid &gt;directly to the U.S. Postal Service </i><br>
<i>&gt;for a service they do not even</i><br>
<br>
provide.
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;The whole point of the Internet is democracy and non-interference. If </i><br>
<i>&gt;the &gt;federal government is permitted to tamper with our liberties by adding </i><br>
</a>
<a name="3131qlink8"><i>&gt;a &gt;surcharge to email, who knows where it will end. You are already paying</i><br>
an
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;exorbitant price for snail mail because of bureaucratic inefficiency. It </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; currently takes up to 6 days for a letter to be delivered from New York</i><br>
to
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Buffalo. If the U.S. Postal Service is allowed to tinker with email, it </i><br>
<i>&gt;will &gt;mark the end of the "free" Internet in the United States. &gt; &gt;One </i><br>
<i>&gt;congressman, Tony Schnell (r) has even suggested a "twenty to forty dollar </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;per month surcharge on all Internet service" above and beyond the </i><br>
<i>&gt;government's &gt;proposed email charges. Note that most of the major </i><br>
<i>&gt;newspapers have ignored the &gt;story, the only exception being the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Washingtonian which called the idea</i><br>
<br>
of
<br>
<i>&gt;email &gt;surcharge "a useful concept whose time has come" (March 6th, 1999 </i><br>
<i>&gt;Editorial). &gt; &gt;Don't sit by and watch your freedoms erode away! Send this </i><br>
<i>&gt;e-mail to EVERYONE on &gt;your list, and tell all your friends and relatives </i><br>
<i>&gt;to write to their Congressman &gt;and say "No!" to Bill 602P. It will only </i><br>
<i>&gt;take a few moments of your time, and &gt;could very well be instrumental in </i><br>
<i>&gt;killing a bill we don't want. &gt; &gt;PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW WHO USES </i><br>
</a>
<a name="3131qlink9"><i>&gt;EMAIL REMEMBER THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE &gt;ISSUES THAT EFFECT ALL OF US ONLINE </i><br>
<i>&gt;LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD &gt; &gt;NOW, NOT AFTER. &gt;</i><br>
