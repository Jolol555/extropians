<a name="2376qlink1">How hard is it to clone a human?</a> I heard, from a biology major, that it's
<br>
*relatively* easy, that she<a name="2376qlink2"> could do it herself with a few thousand dollars<br>
worth of equipment. Does anyone know if this is correct?</a> If so, I recommend
to everyone reading this to learn as much about<a name="2376qlink3"> cloning methods as possible,
if you are in a position to do so. Cloning for the purpose of procreation is
pretty pointless, unless you have medical problems making you infertile.</a> Its
<a name="2376qlink4">use in anti-aging technology is understated though.</a> Stem cells which new,
young organs could be grown from would<a name="2376qlink5"> be rejection-proof if cloned from the
</a>
individual they are to be placed into.<a name="2376qlink6"> It's also possible that neural stem
cells could hold as much promise in combating general aging-related dementia
as they do for specific diseases like alzheimer's and parkinson's, or maybe
even enhance memory and cognitive function in normal individuals.</a> Given the
<a name="2376qlink7">hysteria over cloning, and its imminent banning (I'm 99% confident it will
be banned for several decades at least),</a> it's important to set up an
infastructure of some sort in which<a name="2376qlink8"> research and medical usage of cloning
</a>
can be done illegally.
