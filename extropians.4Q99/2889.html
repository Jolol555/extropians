<p>
if true then you don't have to worry that it's lying when one of our intelligent
computers says it is experiencing qualia because it would be easier
for us to build one that does than one that does not.

<p>
<a href="2837.html#2889qlink2">    &gt;An  abstract "1" or "0" have minimal diversity while the various different</a><br>
<i>    &gt; qualia are way diverse.</i><br>

<p>
The genetic code used by DNA is digital (base 4) and yet is pretty darn
diverse, the same is true of the English language except it's base 26.

<p>
That's why programmers use assemblers and high level languages, but
that doesn't mean the 1s and 0s are no longer there.


<p>
   &gt;But an even more compelling reason might be motivation.  How
<br>
<a href="2837.html#2889qlink4">    &gt;motivated are current abstract AI programs?</a><br>

<p>
They never get distracted they never get bored they never give up,
in other words the trouble with AI programs is that they're far too
motivated. A creative intelligence occasionally gets distracted, it
also gets board and throws in the towel when a problem shows
no sign of a solution, it can always find something more productive
to work on. I think that if you can teach a machine the proper time
to get board you're 80% of the way toward a true AI.

It's perfectly true to say that the balloon got larger because I thought it
would be fun to blow it up, but it's equally true to say that it got larger
because the pressure inside it increased, But what is this thing "pressure"?
Is it a mysterious non material fifth force that floats around in no
particular place and causes things to expand? No, pressure is
just a higher level description, a description of the collective
motions of particles. The molecules don't know anything about
pressure, they just bounce around according to Newton's law's of
motion. Our tiny brains are not able to cope with the trillions
of collisions of air molecules against the side of the balloon
so we must go to a higher level description.

<p>
In this example you lose a little accuracy but at a huge saving in
complexity, in some cases you may not lose any accuracy at all.
Although It's perfectly true that William Shakespeare made his living
and reputation by putting a subset of ASCII characters in a
particular sequence I think you would do better in a literature
test if you thought about it at a somewhat higher level.

<p>
Similarly it's usually not appropriate to talk about quantum
jumps or even neuron firings when trying to understand human
behavior (although Nanotechnology may change that) ; we use
higher level concepts like qualia, judgment, belief, preference,
emotion and free will.

<p>
Wow, all this talk about higher level  meaning has made me
nervous, I think I'll look at the air pressure graph I made at
the last Beethoven Symphony and relax.
