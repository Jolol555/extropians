I planned to write a whole thing about how computers use to
have character, how nobody will ever want to buy a 386 or
run Windows 3.0 for nostalgia, how much of a geek I am, et
cetera, but it's late, I'm tired, and I want to see if
anyone knows where I can get a NeXTcube, NeXTstation, and a
Thinking Machines CM-n (where n is a number between 1 and 5,
I think)?<a name="1158qlink1">  I'm planning on starting a little collection of
all the computers I really wanted to own and can now afford
due to obsolescence (although I imagine the Connection
Machine will still be quite costly, I've found some NeXT
computers between $200-$1000).  Hmm, what about old Cray
supercomputers?  Surely there'd be people willing to *pay
</a>
me* to get rid of them, being so big an' all.

<p>
Oh, and all the stuff I didn't write would have been on
topic.
