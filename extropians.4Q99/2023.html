<a name="2113qlink1">Last night I was inspired to write out a ruff idea I had for a basic AI that 
should become self aware.</a>  Please look over what I wrote, comment, and point 
me to any sources of anyone you know who may already be doing this.  Thanks

<i>-Build a robot.</i><br>
<i>-Robot is equiped with sight, sound, and basic touch.</i><br>
-The robot can focus its attention.<br>
-The robot remembers every position and every sensation in varies<br>
levels of memory based on the sensitivity settings of its varies
parts.
<br>
-Sensations are stored in different types of memory, begining with<br>
very short term memory.  Memory is passed down to longer term memory
based on how much of the sensations are recognized.  As memory is
passed down it is sorted and grouped with other sensations based on
time recognition.
<br>
-Memory program doesn't store the same sensations in memory twice.<br>
-Cognitive program constantly checks memory database for patterns and<br>
catagorizes its findings in sections that may be linkied.
<br>
-Catagorizing breaks apart what the robot senses into meaningful<br>
information, sorting by process of pattern recognition.
<br>
-Sensations are taken and processed as super high speeds so groups of<br>
sounds like whole words such as "hello" aren't stored but only parts
of the sounds.

<p>
-The robot can be programmed to be curious of and interact with its<br>
environment.

<p>
<a name="2113qlink2">-The robot should be able to learn language just as babies do, and<br>
thus effectively communicate with humans.</a>

<p>
-Because the robot remembers every position it's in and interacts with <br>
itself, it will recognize itself and become self aware.
