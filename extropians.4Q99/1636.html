<a name="1682qlink1">I want to know what you and other Extropians think.</a>  Is it plausible
that Jesus was an alien?  How likely would you view that to be?

<p>
Do you look at other religious miracles in the same way - judging whether
they would be doable with technology that we can foresee, and if so,
that they might well have represented ET activity?

<p>
<a name="1684qlink1">How about today?  If you were an ET here, and compassionate,</a> but
determined to allow the civilization to develop roughly on its natural
course, mightn't you still want to help those around you in a small way?
Nothing that would be noticed or attract attention, but maybe a little
healing now and then, a touch of magic when needed?  Do you think it
likely that such beings exist and are active in our world?
