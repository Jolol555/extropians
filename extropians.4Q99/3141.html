Bruce Sterling's 1984 novel _Schismatrix_ has a group of "mechanists"
(humans who use hardware to augment their abilities; there are many
different types of them in the novel and associated short stories) dubbed
lobsters in which the difference between body and spacesuit has become
blurred.

<a name="3149qlink1">I also briefly go over such in "For a Free Frontier: The Case for Space
Colonization."  (See my web site below.  I dismiss terraforming because it
seems too expensive and less likely.  However, with nanotech...  But that is
almost a mantra on this list.:)</a>
