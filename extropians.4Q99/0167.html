<a name="0184qlink4">One idea for nonlethal weaponry that we haven't really touched on is the use 
of foams and other sticky type materials to coat an assailant.  I think these 
weapons would work fairly well against an aggressor who had only melee 
weapons, but I do not know that it would be all that efficacious against an 
attacker with a gun in hand.  Seems to me that even if you could coat the 
person and gun before they could shoot, it would be likely they could still 
pull the trigger and that a bullet would tear right through the stuff.  Just 
thought I ought to include it for completeness's sake.</a>
