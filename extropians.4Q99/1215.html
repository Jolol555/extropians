<a name="1226qlink1">Spike, you really have to read Nanomedicine!  Section 4.4.3,
pg 103, "Single-Proton Massometer".  Its basically a very
long beam.  Stick a molecule on the end and measure the change
</a>
in the resonance period of the beam.  Its the same principle
now used in quartz microbalances.

<p>
Nope, Handbook of Chemistry &amp; Physics says natural C is 1% 13C.

<p>
Not "macro-scale" distortions, but "nano-scale" distortions.
This is at the edge of my knowledge of materials science
properties.  The question is what are the fundamental causes
of both heat and electrical conduction.  Most of this is
a property of the electrons, but there has to be some coupling
of the electrons to the nucleus.  When you heat something up
it isn't just the electrons vibrating, its the nuclei as
well.  13C is going to vibrate at a rate that is different
from 12C so I would expect it to cause distortions in the
propagation of thermal "currents".

<p>
I think the main reason has more to do with better heat conduction
and perhaps electrical/insulating properties and perfect crystal
lattices (which is starting to become fairly important).

Quite probably.  Our engineering is at a much higher level with
these devices at this point (100+ years worth).  I do seem to
recall however that in the mid-50's there was some research done
by the air-force into nuclear powered aircraft (bombers forever
in flight, etc.).  If our nuclear engineering gets to the point
where our gas-engine/turbine engineering is now we might see
nuclear air-cars or rockets.  Dyson worked on Project Orion involving
atomic bomb propulsion for interstellar travel.  See:
 "Death of a Project", Freeman Dyson, Science 149(3680):141-144 (9 July 1965)

<p>
Of course, you can apply some "counter-intuitive" thinking here.
If you can't engineer the car, engineer the driver and passengers.
We probably want much better shielding and certainly better DNA
repair in our cells anyway.  Shielding the nuclei of each cell
or simply letting the radiation hit the DNA and repairing it may
be better solutions than weighing the air-car down with a lead
shield around the engine.

<p>
Nuclear power is worth consideration because of the higher power
output to fuel weight ratio.  Now that I'm thinking about this
it certainly seems like you could apply the same principles for
nuclear nanobot power cells in your body (148Gd) to the air
car and eliminate the shielding hassles.  Nanomedicine discusses
using higher energy power sources 210Po or 238Pu with some
additional shielding.  Robert says a 0.2 kg (~1 inch^3) block
of 148Gd yields ~120 W for 100 years (NM pg 157).  Lets say
I need 500hp for the air-car.  That works out to ~372000W, so
it looks like I need a 15 inch^3 block of 148Gd.  This weighs
675 kg, so it isn't light and doesn't take into account the
shielding requirements.  So you probably have to go to a "hotter"
material or have some buffering mechanisms.  [The car sitting
overnight in your garage uses the energy being produced to
charge up an array of nano-flywheels].  Since the flywheels
have an energy storage density of 5x10^10 J/m^3 the question
is how big do you want your "gas" tank?  Say I want 10 hours
of flight time, that means I need 1.3x10^10 W.  So something
around the size of a gas tank or engine bay worth of flywheels
will store the energy required.  The flywheels weigh a lot
less than the nuclear power sources as well (carbon vs. 148Gd
or something even heavier).  For comparison purposes gasoline
works out to 2.8x10^10 J/m^3, so the flywheels are about twice
as dense. 

<p>
NM (pg 141) discusses energy densities and power quite a bit.
Since for flight we want the greatest power-to-weight ratio
Robert says that is H2 @ 1000atm pressure.  That gives you
4.9x10^9 J/m^3 density and 1.2x10^8 J/kg weight.  If you
want to fix the density problem (since this makes for a big
fuel tank that drives up drag), you need to go to either
solid-H2 (at 57,000 atm pressure or frozen) for 7.2x10^10
J/m^3 or burn diamond at 1.2x10^11 J/m^3.

<p>
It is interesting though that we can't get too much better
than gasoline with either figure of merit (less than an
order of magnitude).  The only way around that would seem
to be NASA's atomic H fuel.
