SCOTTISH CLINIC WILL IMPORT DANISH SPERM:

<p>
Media speculation on the prospect of fertility clinics in the UK importing
foreign sperm was proved correct when the Glasgow Royal Infirmary was
granted permission last Wednesday to import sperm from Denmark. After 18
months of campaigning, the clinic managed to convince the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) that this was the best way of
reducing the chronic backlog of infertility cases in the area whilst
maintaining safety standards - the HFEA's initial worry with the proposal.
<p>
   The sperm will be bought from the Cryos sperm bank in Copenhagen, which
already supplies 20 countries and which claims that its 250 active donors
have been responsible for about 3,000 births worldwide. The Cryos clinic has
been made a satellite of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary in order that the HFEA
may impose its own safety requirements. Danish donors will have to give
written consent before their sperm is exported to the UK. They will also
have to supply the same information that is currently required of UK donors,
including their names.
