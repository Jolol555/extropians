<i>&gt;Besides which - nobody has to be polite to me, because I've made the</i><br>
<i>&gt;unilateral commitment not to be violent to them.  Again, Crocker's Rules</i><br>
<i>&gt;are a mental discipline, not an agreement.</i><br>

<p>
Good points.  There was this true jerk who used to hang with libertarians in 
Long Beach during the mid-to-late 80's.  He never claimed to be a 
libertarian and in fact hinted strongly that he was a government agent.  He 
boasted of being involved in the CIA's Phoenix operation, although people 
who knew him better assured me that this was just one of many lies that he 
employed to cultivate his sinister air.  He always wore black, preferring a 
long cape, and at well over six feet, he could definitely make "sinister" 
work.

<p>
On the more serious side, he threatened physical violence up to death 
casually against anyone who dared to say anything that offended him, and he 
was known to carry out his threats on occasion, having allegedly a brown 
belt in some form of karate.  Sam Konkin made him, in spite of the fact that 
he was exactly the opposite of libertarian, an "honorary libertarian" 
because he was into SF and a FAN and even had had some minor league stuff 
published.  On several occasions this person threatened me with death, and 
explained in detail how he was going to do it.  The only reason that he is 
still alive is that I have more important things to do than worry about a 
murder conviction.

<p>
Thus, with Sam's sanction behind him, he had free range in various 
libertarian circles, and went to all the parties, where he enjoyed 
threatening the males and getting swarmed by all the adoring fems.  BTW, he 
was always VERY polite and mannerly, even as he would say something like 
(smiling courteously), "Don't take this wrong, but if you continue to say 
things that I find offensive, then I will kick your head in."  Then he would 
sit and smirk as he waited for the recipient to try to pretend that nothing 
had happened and carry on a polite conversation.  Not exactly conducive to 
intellectual inquiry.

<p>
The fact that no one ever really stood up to him or demanded that he leave a 
party, as far as I know, was to me a good indication of the lack of real 
seriousness in the movement.  Even as of a couple of years ago this person 
is still apparently accepted as a good libertarian in Sam's tiny following.
