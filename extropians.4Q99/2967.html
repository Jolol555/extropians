*Sigh*

I did not make this model up.  This is how all recessive genes work.  Blue
eyes are defined by recessive genes.  Not all recessive genes die out.  What
if blue-eyed recessives are more attractive than brown-eyed dominants?  They
might get more reproductive chances.  Similarly, straight gay-gene carriers
who look like gay body builders might get more dates.

<p>
My point was merely that the reproductive habits of the gays would be a
minor influence on the gene's propagation in this example.  It would be the
behavior of the straight gene carriers that propagated the gene to the next
generation.  The assumption that a gene causing nonreproduction would be
selected out by basic genetics is just plain wrong.  And as someone else
rightly pointed out, most gays do have children.

<p>
As a biology minor, I am merely pointing out the flaws in stated beliefs
about genetics.  Real genetics doesn't work the way most people on this list
seem to assume.
