<a name="2416qlink1">    I have been thinking lately about the whole selfish vs selfless debate, 
and about how both sides seem to me to be missing something.  I used to 
preach what I referred to as benevolent self-interest<a name="2277qlink1"> (yes this is very 
similar to certain ideas in venturism and extrosattvaism),</a> but even that 
seems less than complete of a description now to me.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2416qlink2"><a name="2410qlink1"><a name="2407qlink1">    I believe that the most important quality in the universe is self.</a>  But 
<a name="2410qlink2">not my self alone.  All selves are valuable to me (though I do have 
favorites).  I am interested in bettering the lives of all selves,</a> mine and 
</a>
</a>
<a name="2410qlink3"><a name="2407qlink2">others.  Of course, my main focus will be on doing what is best for myself 
and those others I have the closest contact</a> with.  I believe in 
responsibilities of proximity and scale and competence.  The closer</a> you are 
<a name="2407qlink3">to a self, the greater your responsibility (and who is closer</a> than yourself), 
<a name="2407qlink4">the smaller the scale, the fewer people need act (and a single person</a> is the 
<a name="2407qlink5">smallest scale, so you and a few others should in general be able to help 
with most problems that effect just you), and of course the greater your 
ability to render assistance in any situation determines</a> responsibility (as I 
<a name="2407qlink6">have had medical training, especially ACLS, my responsibility</a> to respond to 
<a name="2407qlink7">an injured person is greater than that of someone who has only seen CPR on 
TV).  Now, this theory puts great emphasis on taking care of yourself as much 
as possible because 1) you are usually, but not always,</a> in the best position 
<a name="2407qlink8">to do so and 2) by caring for yourself, you help lighten the burden of 
responsibilities on those around you.  But it is not a sink</a> or swim concept, 
<a name="2407qlink9">nor does it forget the other person.</a>

<p>
    Essentially, what I am saying is that each and every person is important. 
 I have heard it said before that each person is a universe within 
themselves, and when they die, a whole universe dies.  I believe to a certain 
degree this is true.  Further, the ability to care, to feel, to desire, this 
is in my estimation the most valuable thing in the universe.  It must be used 
with care, and it must be afforded respect.

<p>
    Altruism is unsatisfactory because it usually misses the trees for the 
forest, ignoring the person you could do the most good for, yourself.  
Selfishness is as bad for it often doesn't even know there are other trees, 
much less a forest.  I believe we must always remember that we are, if you 
will, a tree among trees, who all together are the forest.  We are not 
diminished for being this one tree, nor are the other trees devalued just 
because they aren't this one tree, nor are they diminished because they 
compose the forest, nor is the forest lessened because we discern it is 
composed of trees.  

<p>
    So I say leave behind the question of whether to aid others or look after 
yourself.  Do both, as much as you can.  Look about yourself and see what you 
can best do to make our universe a decent place to be.  True, more often than 
not we will be able to do precious little in any one situation, but if we 
keep striving great things can happen.  I plan to.  How about you?
