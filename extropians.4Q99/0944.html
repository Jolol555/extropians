 &gt; Arthur's timescale for nano is rather conservative, but it worries me more
 &gt; (as I've said before) that he continues to places credence in `cold fusion'
 &gt; (even giving Pons and Fleischman a Nobel in a few years). Or does he, after
 &gt; all, know something we don't...?

</pre>
<p>
Jonathan Post and I have discussed this very topic. Neithe of us thinks
ACC has any special knowledge about 'cold fusion', nor about
tapping the vacuum energy. Example: a claim that Siberians are already using
cold fusion reactors as home heating does not have any supporting evidence.

                   reactions goes on the market, heralding the end
                   of the Fossil-Fuel Age. Economic and
                   geopolitical earthquakes follow, and, for their
                   discovery of so-called "Cold Fusion" in 1989,
                   Pons and Fleischmann receive the Nobel Prize
