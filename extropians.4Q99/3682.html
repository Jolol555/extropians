For someone who grew up with the Apollo program as a sort of secular 
religion, it's hard not to support the Mars Direct mission or others of its 
kind.  But I'm deeply skeptical of the possibility that such a mission will 
be mounted in the current political and economic milieu.  As others have 
pointed out, the time-frame when missions of this kind could first be 
realistically attempted (the 2010s) is when we ought to begin to see dramatic 
impact from technologies that will create a new political and economic 
environment, one in which much more ambitious projects can be attempted 
within a relatively short time (by, say, 2025 or so), with less cost and risk 
and more benefit.  Accordingly, I think these plans are being made for a very 
narrow window of time.  I think working on such plans does no harm and serves 
to keep people interested and enthusiastic about space exploration and 
development.  I just think they have a decreasing likelihood of ever 
happening because they will be overtaken by developments outside the narrow 
confines of space technology.
