<a href="0308.html#0315qlink1">&gt; as a threat to his cultural history.  Native Americans are caught</a><br>
<i>&gt; in a bind.  They can live on a reservation where they can have their</i><br>
<i>&gt; culture but have few economic opportunities or move away from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reservation, losing their culture but having more opportunities to</i><br>
<i>&gt; educate themselves and prosper.  Since he also teaches Native</i><br>
<i>&gt; American history he can also cite chapter and verse where the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government has run amok, abused power, broken promises, etc.</i><br>

<p>
I think that it is a bind of their own creation. If a dedication to a
particular culture or history is preventing a person from fully realizing
his or her maximum potential (that is, through embracing our modern
technological society), then that's a choice they'll have to make. But in a
very real sense, such a person is trying to have the best of both worlds,
and sometimes you just can't do that. If someone chooses to be a luddite,
they shouldn't bemoan the fact that they don't have an ISDN line for their
PC...

<p>
I would also ask why it is that aboriginal Americans who leave their
reservations must necessarily lose touch with their culture? Irish, Italian,
Japanese, Chinese, and a host of other "hyphenated Americans" have been able
to flourish in modern society and enjoy all its benefits while still
maintaining touch with their original culture. Admittedly, it's of a
somewhat different nature than if they were still in Ireland or Japan or
wherever, but it hardly need be completely eradicated.
