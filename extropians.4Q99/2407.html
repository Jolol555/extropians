yourself),
<br>
<a href="2271.html#2407qlink4">&gt;  the smaller the scale, the fewer people need act (and a single person is </a><br>

(as 
<br>

<a href="2271.html#2407qlink6">&gt;  have had medical training, especially ACLS, my responsibility to respond </a><br>
to 
<br>
<a href="2271.html#2407qlink7">&gt;  an injured person is greater than that of someone who has only seen CPR on </a><br>
<i>&gt;  TV).  Now, this theory puts great emphasis on taking care of yourself as </i><br>
<i>&gt; much </i><br>
<i>&gt;  as possible because 1) you are usually, but not always, in the best </i><br>
position 
<br>
<a href="2271.html#2407qlink8">&gt;  to do so and 2) by caring for yourself, you help lighten the burden of </a><br>
<i>&gt;  responsibilities on those around you.  But it is not a sink or swim </i><br>
concept, 
<br>
<a href="2271.html#2407qlink9">&gt;  nor does it forget the other person.</a><br>
