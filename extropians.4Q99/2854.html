*Technology feature : Focus on carbon nanotubes. They are the ultimate in<br>
electronic miniaturization: tube-shaped molecules of carbon, each scarcely
wider than a filament of DNA, able to conduct electricity and to be bent,
cut and moulded into circuit wiring or even into new electronic devices.
They are called carbon nanotubes. Philip Ball takes an in-depth look at
their past, present and future. (Nature Friday 26 November 1999)

*Assembling Molecules an Atom at a Time. Wilson Ho, Cornell professor of<br>
physics, and graduate research assistant Hyojune Lee used a specially
designed scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to pick up single molecules of
carbon monoxide and graft them onto an iron atom to form molecules of iron
carbonyl. By obtaining the new assembly's "vibrational spectrum" -- a
measure of the energy in the bonds between atoms -- they verified that a
chemical bond had truly been formed to produce a new molecule. (Cornell News

*MICROFLUIDICS CAN BE DRIVEN BY HEAT rather than by electric fields.<br>
Microfluidics is to the mixing of fluids (including studies of blood, DNA,

transactions occur quickly, controllably, in a very small space. (AIP

diplomat to conduct lifesaving microsurgery...blah blah blah, until

*Theory Promotes Different Types of Intelligence. Albert Einstein was one of<br>
the greatest thinkers the world has ever known. An extraordinary polymath
who left few branches of physics untouched, he formulated theories of
relativity, successfully described the nature of the universe and came up
with the most famous equation in the world. David Beckham is the footballer
whose skill and precision have made him one of the most gifted sportsmen of
his generation. His looks and Spice Girl wife add to the allure, but it is
his pure talent that makes him a firm favourite as European Footballer of
the Year, to be decided next month. Who is the more intelligent? (Fox Nov

*Using Neural Networks. These programs can be taught to think like chemists<br>
about some kinds of problems.Inspired by theories of the brain in the 1940s,
programmers devised neural networks, mathematical models that rely on
varying the strength of connections between internal processing elements to
interpret data. Knowing how to build a neural network is one thing, but
knowing how to leverage it into a useful application is something much more
important. (Todays Chemist at work Nov 99)

*Deinococcus radiodurans, is the most radiation-resistant creature known,<br>
able to survive a dose 3,000 times the amount of radiation that would kill a
human (1956). Now, scientists report in the Nov. 19 issue of Science that
they have deciphered the organism's complete genetic code, an advance they
hope will lead to insights into how it manages to repair so efficiently the
damage caused by radiation. (Columbus Dispatch Nov 28, 99)

*What If Cold Fusion Is Real? It was the most notorious scientific<br>
experiment in recent memory - in 1989, the two men who claimed to have

a public hearing in Washington today to discuss the practice of using
genetics to alter crops. Experts say the technology -- already used with
corn, soybeans and many other foods -- is just as safe as accepted
plant-breeding methods. But following protests in Britain, some Americans
are raising questions about genetically-modified foods. In genetic
engineering, DNA from bacteria and other organisms is injected into food
crops to make them more resistant to pests  or to give them other useful
properties. Hear the audio on NPR. (Nov 30,99)
