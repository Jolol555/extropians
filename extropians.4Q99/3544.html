Cough, cough ...

<p>
Laser boost requires (a) honking great big lasers, and (b) reliability.
Neither of these has been demonstrated on the scale required -- not
saying it's impossible, but we're at 1901 Lilienthal glider stage
and discussing what we can do with a DC-3.

<p>
Why not go the tried and tested route and steal a leaf from Gerald
Bull's book?

<p>
Yes, explosive-powered guns look crude and old-fashioned. But they're
also a _practical_ technology, even with 1980's tech. Before Bull
was assassinated he'd designed and ordered the supergun test item
for Project Babylon; we have no reason to believe it wouldn't have
worked, given Bull's history (as probably the pre-eminent artillery
designer of the 20th century, and an expert on the hypersonic 
aerodynamics of ballistic re-entry vehicles -- he helped design the
Minuteman-III and Titan-II RV's).

<p>
It's worth noting that Bull's design _wasn't_ a pure gun -- it
was a discarding-sabot high-velocity cannon designed to launch a
very simple two-stage solid-fuel rocket. The goal was to ultimately
be able to put a robust 100Kg payload into orbit every 90 minutes.
This sounds to me a lot like a 1Kg intelligent brick every minute,
and it was feasible any time from the mid-seventies on. (Anyone
else remember Project HARP?)
