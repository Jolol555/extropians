<p>
Me too obviously

<a href="3768.html#3780qlink4">    &gt;&gt;when something--like other people, act</a><br>
     &gt;&gt;intelligently--they are conscious.

<p>
      &gt;Golly, we have to ASSUME it?

<p>
Yes, I agree with Bob about that.

<p>
<a name="3783qlink1">       &gt;It doesn't seem as impossible as you made it out to be.

<p>
I am absolutely certain that intelligence without consciousness is
impossible, by that I mean there is no doubt in my mind. The
answer to the related question, am I also correct, will always
remain unknown.</a>

<p>
     &gt;For all you want to poke fun at me for using the zombie  example,

<p>
There is nothing wrong with the zombie example and I certainly had no
intention of making fun of you, I think your posts are quite interesting
and intelligent, I just think they're wrong.

<p>
<a name="3783qlink2">      &gt;HERE YOU ARE USING IT.

<p>
No, one of my characters is, I am not Bob, Alf, or Zed.</a>

<pre>
     &gt; Don't tell me that we have to assume it.  We don't.  I reject it, and I'm
     &gt; arguing that you should, too.


</pre>
<p>
<a name="3783qlink3">I don't anyone could function if they did that, I know you reject it when you
argue philosophy on the Extropian List but I'm skeptical that you do it in
any other part of your life, when you hit your finger with a hammer for
example. You may find reasons much later why the pain was unreal,
but I'll bet dollars to donuts that's not what you felt at the time.</a>

<p>
<a name="3783qlink4">By the way, in light of your views you used a very odd word that I
don't understand at all, the word was "should".</a>

<p>
<a href="3768.html#3780qlink5">    &gt;I've just given a name to something which YOU think is conceptually</a><br>
<i>    &gt;coherent, and THAT'S my challenge to YOU.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3783qlink5">No, I don't think it's conceptually coherent, I'm certain it's not, I just can't prove</a> it

<p>
<a name="3783qlink6"><a href="3768.html#3780qlink6">    &gt;YOU could be under the mistaken "impression" that you have qualia as well.</a><br>

<p>
Like all really important things "qualia" has no definition worth a damn,
all I have are examples of it, or rather one example. Thus I certainly
mean something when I say, I experience "qualia", I just have no way
of knowing if it has any relationship to your understanding of the word.</a>

<p>
<a name="3783qlink7"><a href="3696.html#3780qlink7">    &gt;Why should this process give rise to  experience?</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3800qlink1">I can't tell you why intelligence generates consciousness,</a> Einstein couldn't
<a name="3814qlink1"><a name="3800qlink2">tell you why mass warps space-time, he just showed that it did.</a></a></a>
