Glad to see you're thinking for the long term; shoulda said so.

<p>
One answer, of course - and the best - is:
"I'll worry about it a billion years from now."

<p>
But in partial answer to your question, I would say that we've had
literally dozens of speculations on this list - ranging from creating
our own Universes, to manufacturing equal amounts of positive and
negative matter, to encoding computations in warped spacetime, and so on
and so on - under which there would be no limits to growth.  And we've
had nitpickers for every suggestion.  It's really an open question, and
while it's fun to discuss, it's ultimately one of those things where you
just have to try and find out.
