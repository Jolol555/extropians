<p>
Here's a simple low-tech solution.  Just use a pocket knife or other
suitable tool to gently pry up on the control key, popping it up out of
the keyboard.  On some keyboards there are actually two small plastic
moldings, nested one into the other, which make up the control key.  It
should be easy to do this without damaging anything.  Take careful note
of how the removable plastic key cap came out of its seat so you can
later put it back in the same way, when you want to use the key.   While
the key cap is out, hitting its seat (the place on the keyboard) with
your finger should not actuate the key's function.  There will probably
be a small spring sticking out.  Leave it there, and don't lose it.  If
you like you can put some tape over the seat to keep the spring from
getting lost, and to keep foreign objects from falling into the exposed
seat. 


<p>
Alternatively you could leave the key cap in place, and tape a small
solid barrier in place covering the key, which would prevent the key from
being accidently pressed.
