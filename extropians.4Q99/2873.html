You are defining a term using that same term.  And you're pandering to the 
common notion that gays are over-sexed.  Shame on you.  We don't need to be 
cured by you.  Get used</a> to it.

For humans, the twin pressures of predation and starvation have been 
diminishing for a long time, allowing our population to grow beyond all

This little answer solves a couple little problems:
1)  Gays are unnatural.  (No they're not.)
2)  Gays are against god.  (No they're not, or No god. Take your pick.)
