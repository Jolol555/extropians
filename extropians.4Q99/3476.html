Yes, the question is whether the population growth rate is faster or
slower than the total economic growth rate.  For the last few hundred
years it has been slower, mainly because economic doubling times (every
15 years) have exceeded the the speed at which humans can produce
highly trained children.  For many millenia before that however economic
doubling times (every 900 years) were much less than feasible population
doubling times, and so incomes were near subsistence levels.   With
uploads, feasible copying rates would again exceed feasible economic
doubling times (even if that was 1 year), and so I predict a return to
Mathusian type equilibria.

<a name="3485qlink1">I'm not sure I understand you, but it seems that you are saying that
future economies will have less demand for intelligent labor, such as
humans and uploads can provide.  I think this is pretty unlikely.</a>
