&gt;Any biologist will tell you that homosexuality is found in all species =
of
<br>
&gt;mammal higher than a cat.  Maybe all these species are acting =
"unnaturally"
<br>
&gt;according to your definition, but I would suggest you find a different =
term.

<p>
Definitely. Such a term has no use here. It's a common misconception =
spawned by the empirical scientists necessity to create a distinction =
between the students and the studied. The adapted word "Natural" has no =
meaning. You think it does? Then define it. You will fail.
