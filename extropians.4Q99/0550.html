<a name="0560qlink1">Actually, I just realized that we may be talking about two different things--
a press kit and a media reference binder.</a>  Didn't cover press kits in the
media paper, and maybe you could write some sort of guidance on compiling
press kits on various topics.  I support the development of many versions of 
this sort of thing, because different people and groups will have different
goals for media coverage.  

<p>
<a name="0560qlink2">With regard to a media reference binder, which I did mention in the paper,
that is a binder of materials to keep handy for quick reference.</a>  Mine, which
is in pieces-parts right now, contains various FAQs, sets of statistics that 
I might need, notes from media trainings, contact info on people I can make 
references for, a section for five-pointers, listings of past/future
publications and activities, listings of past media appearances.
