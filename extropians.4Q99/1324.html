I'm so confident that's true I haven't even bothered to test it, just
follow that commandment and you'll get rich.

<p>
No, but I'm not big on reading studies of that sort. I do know that for
the last 8 to 10 years  low P/E "value" stocks have done less well
than the average stock and much less well than high P/E "growth"
stocks. I think the PE ratio is very important information because
it tells you how expensive a stock is, but you need to know lots of
other stuff to know what it is you're buying, to figure out if it's worth
the price or not. Asking "Is buying a high PE stock a good idea?"
is like asking "Is buying a $1000 object a good idea?".

      &gt;&gt;ME:
      &gt;&gt;It has been nearly 4 years since the prediction, not a trivial fraction
      &gt;&gt;of a human lifetime, and in that time the market has exploded upward.

<a name="1332qlink1">For me the value of any economic idea is its usefulness, a failed
prediction is not very useful. OK, in the long term it's possible he
could still be right, but in the long term we're all dead.</a>
