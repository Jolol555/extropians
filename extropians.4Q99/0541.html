<a name="0542qlink1">I interpreted the statements a little differently due to the singularity.
All history we know of to date will pale in comparison to what happens
when the singularity hits because the rate of change will be so much
more rapid.  I noticed recently that people have started refering to
business developments &amp; personal rates of change in terms of "Internet Time".
Internet time is going be *slow* compared to "singularity time".

I believe Eric D. commented on this at Extro4 when answering a question
someone asked.  The gist of his comment was that exponential growth curves
look very flat at the beginning (on non-log scales).  So "history" in terms
of "rate of occurence of significant developments", history really hasn't
begun yet.<a name="0542qlink2">  While we look at the development of extropianism/transhumansim
now as a significant event (and a d*** hard one to accomplish), looking at
it in retrospect from post-singularity time, it will be as significant as
what Al Capone had for breakfast on the day he died.
