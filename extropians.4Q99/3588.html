<a name="3591qlink1">In contrast to the tofu study suggesting tofu may cause brain
atrophy, this recent epidemiological study found that cognitive 
decline in a large group of cannabis users over 12 years was 
not significantly different than nonusers, and concluded that 
the observed decline "does not appear to be associated with 
cannabis use." The fact that there were was no significant 
difference in cognitive decline between heavy users and  
light users also suggests no cannabis-induced decline.</a>

The purpose of this study was to investigate possible adverse 
effects of cannabis use on cognitive decline after 12 years 
in persons under age 65 years. This was a follow-up study of 
a probability sample of the adult household residents of East
Baltimore. The analyses included 1,318 participants in the 
Baltimore, Maryland, portion of the Epidemiologic Catchment
Area study who completed the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) during three study waves in 1981, 1982, and 1993-1996. 
Individual MMSE score differences between waves 2 and 3 were 
calculated for each study participant. After 12 years, study 
participants' scores declined a mean of 1.20 points on the 
MMSE (standard deviation 1.90), with 66% having scores that 
declined by at least one point. Significant numbers of scores 
declined by three points or more (15% of participants in the 
18-29 age group). There were no significant differences in 
cognitive decline between heavy users, light users, and 
nonusers of cannabis. There were also no male-female differences 
in cognitive decline in relation to cannabis use. The authors 
conclude that over long time periods, in persons under age 65 
years, cognitive decline occurs in all age groups. This decline 
is closely associated with aging and educational level but does 
not appear to be associated with cannabis use.
