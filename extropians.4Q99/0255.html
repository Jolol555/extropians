I'm not very good at using this mailing list, but whoever wrote the last 
section about everyone not being passionate about their fields just because 
of having a degree - good for you!  I hope to go back to college only to gain 
information to help me do my future job and to gain credentials our 
<br>
(narrow-minded) society requires for work as a counselor.  You may say <br>
counselors need college/degrees but the ones I've been a client of didn't 
learn enough to do anything for me I couldn't have done for myself.  In fact, 
some have given destructive advice, I can attest to being a victim of that 
myself.  Whoever started this thread must've read my mind because just this 
year I started to realize that college doesn't mean you're educated - my 
neighbor, while working on her master's in counseling (purely coincidental), 
asked my mom "Who's Churchill?"  Mom did confirm she meant Winston Churchill. 
<a name="0318qlink1"> I'd love to get on a soapbox about this education stuff but who would listen 
to me? (I have no degree).  My mom may have been joking but she said I 
shouldn't get too publically vocal about this or I could end up like Malcolm 
X or MLK.  &lt;half smile&gt;  She knows me well enough to know how passionate I am 
about this topic.  Enough said.
