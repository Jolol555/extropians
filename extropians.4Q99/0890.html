Abstract
<br>
  The "Atkins dietary
<br>
  revolution" is a ketogenic diet consisting almost
  exclusively of food from animal origin. A similar diet was
  introduced as the "Banting diet" more than
  a century ago by the English physician Harvey. This
  carbohydrate-free diet is high in fat, cholesterol and
  purines. The measurable ketosis is a precondition for
  the effect of this kind of diet. However,
  the predictable hyperlipacidemia and ketosis are recognized
  health risks. Additionally, hypercholesterolemia is to be expected in a
  greater part of the adherents to such a
  diet. Even children under ketogenic diet
  develop hypercholesterolemia within a short time. A similar high-fat
  diet, known as the Sippy
<br>
  diet for ulcer therapy, was found earlier
  to cause an increased incidence in coronary heart disease. On
  the basis of the known facts
<br>
  the Atkins<a name="0893qlink1"> diet seems to
<br>
  be potentially hazardous to health, unless a controlled study is performed.</a>
  However, considering the risks it seems very problematic to
  perform such a study.
