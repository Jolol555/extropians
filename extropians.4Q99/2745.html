 IS THERE REASON TO BELIEVE TOFU MAY CAUSE BRAIN ATROPHY?

<p>
 The recent study suggesting a link between tofu and brain
 atrophy [1] calls to attention animal research showing that 
 the soy-phytochemical genistein reduces DNA synthesis in the
 brain and inhibits the proliferation of brain cells. [2][3][4] 
 That research tends to support the tofu study, for, since cell 
 replication requires DNA synthesis, genistein-induced synthesis 
 reduction leading to fewer new cells could manifest as atrophy. 

<p>
 The only counter I've seen is that cell-proliferation physiology 
 does not apply to adult brain cells, since they don't replicate. 
 That claim, however, has been invalidated, for it has been shown 
 that neurogenesis--the replication of new brain cells--appears 
 to occur in the brain throughout life. As Dr. David Amaral told 
 The Washington Post (11/21/99): "A decade ago, we still had the 
 notion that you acquired all the neurons you would ever have by 
 the sixth month of pregnancy... It turns out that nothing could 
 be further from the truth." The Washington Post continued:

<p>
  "Last month, biologists at Princeton University demonstrated 
   that monkey brains constantly produce thousands of new 
   neurons which travel to the cerebral cortex, the center 
   of higher intellectual functions. Earlier studies had 
   documented other examples of neurogensis... The same 
   process occurs in humans. ...researchers at the Salk 
   Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., 
   found evidence of recent cell division in a part of the 
   brain called the hippocampus in every person studied." [5]

<p>
 Research in animals shows neurogenesis occurs in several areas 
 of the adult brain. [6][7][8] Research also shows that reduced
 DNA synthesis decreases the number of new brain cells produced. 
<br>
 [9] Based on the available data, I would dare to posit that IF <br>
 in fact genistein inhibits DNA synthesis in the adult human 
 brain as it has been shown to in developing rat brains [2]
 (and based on human/animal/soy studies, I see no reason to 
 believe the rat/soy-to-human/soy extrapolation is unfounded), 
 it stands to reason that soy products would reduce neurogensis
 and/or initiate apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the human 
 brain, which could manifest itself as brain atrophy. In short, 
 there's reason to believe the tofu study [1] may be accurate.

<p>
 But Asians Are Smarter

<p>
 A counter argument to the findings in the tofu study [1] is 
 that Chinese and Japanese consume more soy products than other 
 people, and yet they have very-high IQs, and thus don't appear 
 to suffering from a chemically induced diminution of cerebral 
 capacity. Sounds plausible on its face, but it should be 
 considered that if Asians have higher IQs, due to nature or 
 nurture, this does not mean they could not suffer decrements 
 of IQ that would go unnoticed if, despite the decrement, they 
 still exceed the average IQ of non-Asians. In short, a 500-lb 
 man would still be very large even after losing 200 pounds. 

<p>
 Another point to consider is that if Asian families care for 
 grandparents more often than in the West, where they may be 
 sent to retirement/nursing homes, such family care might tend 
 to "conceal" the rate of cognitive decline in Asian countries. 

<p>
 Another factor to consider is if Asians have been consuming 
 soy for centuries (while it's relatively new to Westerners), 
 then Asians may have inherited immunities to any toxic agents 
 in the foods they consume, since those who food x happens to 
 harm least tend to survive more, passing on their immunities 
 to food-x-toxins to their offspring. In short, Westerners 
 may be more vulnerable to toxins in Asian foods, although 
 I'm not aware of the races of those in the tofu study. [1]
 
<p>
 Of course I hope what I argue above isn't true, and that 
 soy products ARE the healthy panacea I've always assumed! 
 I've been a vegetarian since I was 13-years old because I 
 believe we need to advance beyond the systematic mass murder 
 sentient beings simply for pleasurable taste sensations. With 
 my refrigerator full of soy stuff, I wish I could be sure now,
 but until the soy picture gets clearer, the evidence is enough
 for me to be inclined to err on the side of caution. However, 
 it should be noted that the research indicating an anticancer 
 potential for soy is consistent, and research shows that the 
 cytotoxic properties of soy products are strongly specific, 
 but apparently not entirely exclusive, to cancer cells. If 
 I had terminal cancer, I would consider using soy products!
