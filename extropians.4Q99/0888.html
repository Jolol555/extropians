 to have grades from one of these boards, which emphasizes more
 relevant abilities."). Of course, the Kansas Board of Creationist
 Science might exist, but that is no real problem since it will not be
 a very credible board - what really makes this system interesting is
 if the boards can be reviewed and rated well. &gt;&gt;

This would be a good opportunity for a new field: education experts.</a> One of 
the problems with democracy - though it is fair, it often is easily swayed by 
advertising, religious beliefs or just plain mob-mentality (ignorance). Look 
at what can't be taught in the school: sex education, or many other subject 
matter. Don;t even get me started on the voters: the issues of same sex 
marriages, voted down again and again and more --such as euthanasia and 
legalization of drugs. Seems common sense to me, but the mainstream isn't too 
hot on them. Why? 
<br>
Usually religion... 
<br>
Anyway...

is it plausible? Would schools stick to it? They barely stick to the 
low-standard government ones (I know you're in Europe I mean here in USA).
