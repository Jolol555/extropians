<a href="1180.html#1183qlink1">&gt;then if it isn't a system with a diety ( Toaism for example) would it be a </a><br>
<i>&gt;philosophy? Just curious</i><br>

<p>
If there is no diety and no afterlife based on current life then it is a 
philosophy.  I read the Toa of Physics a while back but was so apolled by 
the nonsince I read I pushed it out of my mind so it wouldn't interfere with 
my everyday reasoning.  I don't remember anything about toaism as a result, 
only that I completely disagreed. I realy can't comment on Toaism because I 
don't remember what it was I was disagreeing with.  What do they believe?
