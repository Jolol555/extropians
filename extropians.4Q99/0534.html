This is quite true.

<p>

<i>&gt;transhumanism and extropianism (snip)</i><br>

<p>
My book is _Create/Recreate: The 34rd Millennial Culture_ and it is the
second edition, and now has more essays and less images.  I spent one year
working on various essays, several of which pertain to transhumanist culture.

<p>
While my Transhuman Timeline pertains to events which were precursors to
our transhumanity, it along with my chapter "Transhuman History" is quite
pertinent and I suggest that you all buy a copy and read it.

<p>
Transhumanism and extropian transhumanism do have a history and that
history is still being written.
