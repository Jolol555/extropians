I hate to digress, but...

<p>
The ATF does not consider a "silencer" to be a silencer if and only if it
is structurally incapable of suppressing a firearm.  Since any
non-deflagrating gas weapon is not a "firearm", it can legally be
suppressed *if* the suppressor is too flimsy to operate at normal firearm
pressures, which in practice means the suppressor is fabricated from
plastic.  Even in states where airguns are treated as firearms, airgun
suppressors are typically still legal as long as they are not the NFA kind.

<p>
I've seen "silenced" paintball guns used, and I can say that they are
*extremely* effective.  The only noise you hear is the projectile whizzing
through the air and the faint wheezing of the piston cycling.  Much, much
quieter than most suppressed firearms.
