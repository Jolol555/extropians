I'm not aware of any 'fast burn' biotech scenarios, I
imagine we'll see some press releases that will feel like
over-night world-shaking changes to those of us with good
imaginations.  If we can build an assembler then that will
create an over-night world-shaking change.  I doubt we'll
transcend but it would be a major turning point in human
history.  I have no idea how AI scales but there's still a
chance (perhaps very small) a Singularitarian scenario might
occur, but I doubt it.

<p>
How your government/society views technology will determine
how successful your country is but the technology itself
will not be changed (exceptions being the colour of Sony's
new home cinema products, etc).

The poor are getting richer and perhaps the rich are getting
even richer.  I'm not sure if todays rich are able to abuse
their money like the rich once were.  Their money comes from
the 'poor' and if they do anything the poor don't like the
cash flow stops.  Look at how careful Bill Gates is with not
having an opinion, the rich have never been so powerless.
