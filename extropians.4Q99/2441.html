Thanks for the feedback, Cynthia.  I think you are right, that my well being 
is quite intertwined with the well being of others.  However, I wanted to 
emphasize that all other things being equal (an example where they are not is 
when one person is trying to hurt another), everyone's well being is equally 
important, including my own.  I'm just usually better able to promote my own 
well being as opposed to most other people in the Universe (not that I don't 
try to help out others).  But it is equally true that it is difficult, and 
perhaps not even useful, to completely separate out what is good for me and 
what is good for another.  As a person, I almost never do anything for just 
one reason, but I do not believe this in any way lessens or corrupts a good 
deed.  I try to help to make the world better for others AND myself.  I try 
not to act out of purely selfish or purely selfless motivations, as either 
view can lead to an unbalanced viewpoint which often causes someone to 
suffer.  Thanks again for the comment.
