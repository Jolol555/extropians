I think there's a fairly large number of us on this list.(at least 3
from Vancouver)  If you want a good list, go to extropy.com mailing list
section, and request the user list for exi-can.

<p>
Doing the same with for extropians, I found 8 .ca people, along with a
few .com's who I know are Canadian.  I would guess 5-10% of this list is
Canadian.

<p>
Actually, let me change that guess, I just checked exi-can, there are 60
people on that list, and there are 340 on extropians, so it is
*possible* up to 20% of the extropian list is Canadian!  I could verify
this by cross-checking the names, but I'm too lazy right now.
