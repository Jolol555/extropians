Ahem: homosexual people are not sterile and in many cases (not just
self-identified bisexuals) have engaged in heterosexual activities at some
time in their lives. In fact, the exclusive, 100%-homosexual lifestyle is
pretty rare. I know a couple of gay men who've never had sex with women --
or say they haven't -- but most of the other gay, not to say bisexual,
people I know have had heterosexual and homosexual relationships. I also
know more than one lesbian with children.

<p>
In fact, there seems to be an underlying assumption in this thread about
homosexuality not being a trait likely to be transmitted. This is just
plain wrong, if it _is_ a hereditable trait. There are big cultural
dependencies, as even a cursory glance at ancient Greek cultural history
will indicate.

<p>
I'm inclined to think that much sexual behaviour in humans is entirely
<a name="2970qlink1">orthogonal to reproductive issues and has little, if anything, to do
with reproductive fitness. But then, that goes for a lot</a> of behaviour;
alcoholism or drug use, for example. (Which, incidentally, are not specific
to humans.)
