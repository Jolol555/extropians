Lucid dreaming, where one has visceral control over the dream, is interesting.
I think it's possible to train to control at least waking dreams, ie those that
occur when the alarm goes off, etcetera.  I find that all the dreams I remember
are in the context where I realize that I am dreaming.  That is, if there is any
memory of the dream, then it is associated with awareness of it being a dream.
I generally don't exert control over dreams, but feel comfortable in
dissassociating myself from the dream state and observing it when my clinical
side takes over.

<p>
You mention invincibility, most of my dreams I might as well as have had a
bottle of tequila.  I have had numerous dreams about combat or with martial
context.  This is in the same context as sports arena.

I think it is not so unusual.  You sound powerful in your dreams.  I have some
dreams that have wormholes with disembodied talking heads that chant like
Tibetan monks, although it's been some time.  They are out there.

Existentialism, Castaneda.

<p>
Dreams often have an extrapolatory ability not present to the conscious, ie, an
opening of the floodgates of the subconscious.  Some people note prescient
dreams, or in general, deja vu, I often see this is a rational extension of the
parallel nature of the brain, which might predict events before they occur,
unconsciously.  I haven't had any good deja vus in several weeks, but am not
concerned.

Have a nice day,
