<a href="1636.html#1682qlink1">&lt;&lt; I want to know what you and other Extropians think.  Is it plausible</a><br>
 that Jesus was an alien?  How likely would you view that to be? &gt;&gt;
    
<p>
    It's possible.  It's also possible that Gandhi was genetically engineered 
by leprechauns in a garden gnome conspiracy but it's not likely.  However I 
can't prove it to be false.  Erich Von Danken wrote some fascinating material 
in the 70s about Aliens intervening with humans "Chariots of the Gods."  It 
makes for fascinating reading but again it would have to fall into the realm 
of faith.  Most of his theories were debunked in the years to come.  I 
believe that one of the books was called "The Chariots Come Crashing Down."
