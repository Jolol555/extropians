MARS PENETRATOR PROBES NAMED FOR PIONEERING POLAR EXPLORERS

<p>
     NASA's Deep Space 2 microprobes, due to smash into the 
surface of Mars near the planet's south pole on Dec. 3, have been 
named Amundsen and Scott in honor of the first explorers to reach 
the South Pole of Earth.

<p>
     Paul Withers, a graduate student at the University of 
Arizona in Tucson, wrote the winning essay in a public contest to 
name the ambitious space mission. His was among a NASA-record 
17,000 entries submitted.

<p>
     "A century ago, Antarctica was the Earth's only unexplored <br>
continent. Then expeditions led by Amundsen and Scott landed 
there, striving to discover its secrets, seeking knowledge, and 
finding a land of stark beauty," wrote Withers, who studies the 
thin upper atmosphere of Mars.  "Scott perished in Antarctica. 
His memorial's inscription reads:  'To strive, to seek, to find, 
not to yield.' These are aims of the Deep Space 2."

<p>
     Norwegian Roald Amundsen explored the Northwest Passage 
before leading the first successful expedition to the South Pole, 
reaching it on Dec. 14, 1911.  Robert Falcon Scott led an English 
team to the South Pole in January 1912, only to discover the 
national flag left during Amundsen's earlier arrival.  Although 
blizzards and starvation claimed Scott and his entire team on 
their return trip, a search party found the team's scientifically 
valuable diaries and notebooks.

<p>
     The main purpose of NASA's miniature probes is technical, 
not scientific: flight-testing advanced technology that could be 
used by future planetary surface microlanders. Constructed to 
survive an abrupt impact at 644 kilometers (400 miles) per hour 
with the layered terrain common in the south polar region of 
Mars, the two Deep Space 2 probes also carry sensors to search 
for the presence of water ice about three feet below the surface, 
as a secondary goal.

<p>
     "Deep Space 2 joins Mars Polar Lander as the first missions <br>
to venture to the south pole of Mars, so it's only fitting to 
name the microprobes after the two explorers who first set foot 
on Earth's South Pole," said Deep Space 2 Project Manager Sarah 
Gavit. "Like Amundsen and Scott, Deep Space 2 will have to 
survive great odds, including not only braving the elements but 
also crashing into the terrain with unbelievable force."

<p>
     A gift certificate for CompUSA merchandise worth $4,000 will 
go to Withers. The prize, provided by Lockheed Martin Corp., the 
Boeing Co. and CompUSA, will go directly from the donating 
companies to the winner. The top 25 finalists will receive one 
copy each of a Deep Space 2 poster signed by project team 
leaders.

<p>
     Participants in the contest were instructed to choose two 
people from history (not living), characters from mythology or 
fiction, two places or things in some way associated with each  
other, or a combination of the above elements. Submissions had to 
be accompanied by a short written composition of up to 100 words 
explaining why the entries would make good names for the probes. 
This essay was used as the tiebreaker if more than one person 
submitted the same pair of names, which happened in the case of 
the winning submission.

<p>
     The Deep Space 2 probes are piggybacking on NASA's Mars 
Polar Lander spacecraft, which was launched on Jan. 3, 1999. Each 
probe has an entry system consisting of a basketball-sized 
aeroshell with a grapefruit-sized probe inside. Released from the 
cruise stage of the Mars Polar Lander on Dec. 3 before it enters 
the atmosphere of Mars, the probes will dive toward the surface 
with no braking system beyond their cone-shaped exterior surface. 
Unlike any spacecraft before them, the probes must endure impact 
forces up to 60,000 times the force of Earth's gravity as they 
hit the surface.  

<p>
     Upon impact, the aeroshell will shatter and the forebody of 
each probe will bury itself up to about one meter (three feet) 
underground, while the aftbody remains on the surface to transmit 
data back to Earth through NASA's Mars Global Surveyor 
spacecraft.  If successful, Deep Space 2 will demonstrate 
innovative approaches to entering a planet's atmosphere, 
surviving a crash-like impact and penetrating below a planet's 
surface. 

<p>
     The mission is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
(JPL) in Pasadena, CA.  JPL is a division of the California 
Institute of Technology, Pasadena.
