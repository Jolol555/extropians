Abstract
<br>
  Mutations in mitochondrial DNA
<br>
  (mtDNA) are undoubtedly associated with a diverse spectrum
  of human disorders. More controversially, it has been
  claimed that they accumulate during ageing, and that they are responsible for
  an age-related decline in bioenergetic function and tissue viability. Here,
  we review the evidence for this assertion, concluding that claims for the
  age-accumulation of mtDNA mutations are based largely on
  non-quantitative methods, and that no clear, functional deficit of
  mitochondrial respiration has been shown to result from such
  lesions in aged individuals. The mitochondrial theory of
  ageing, however attractive in principle, is supported by very little hard
  evidence. [References: 27]
