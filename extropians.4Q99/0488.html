I think you are confused with what I'm talking about.  You are stuck in some 
sort of proposed Socialism.  I'm speaking of Capitalism here.
If I chose to be ignorant as an individual it won't effect you.  But you 
insist on controlling me because you believe your individualism is more 
important than mine.  Well, I have news for you.  It's not.

<a name="0494qlink1">If I chose not to be educated then I won't get the jobs because you will 
take them all up.  Now let's be fare to all people here.  Let's not start a 
war.  There is a way we both can have what we want.</a>

<i>&gt;Similarly, that can be applied to the group as a whole; the rights of all </i><br>

<a href="0481.html#0488qlink2">&gt;the group, as defined by the rights of the majority of individuals.</a><br>

<p>
The problem with socialism is it cannot be free.  And that's what I'm all 
about.  I don't need some individual or group try to force me to do things I 
don't want to because they feel they are more correct than me.  If you want 
to do something than do it but don't drag me along because your friends may 
be not.
