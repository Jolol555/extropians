<a href="0614.html#0618qlink1">&gt; Your definition of sociopath (below) is a more accurate one, and one which</a><br>

<p>
&lt;The Standard Diagnostic Nomenclature of the American Psychiatric
Association includes in its description of "sociopathy" "the inability
to experience shame or guilt" and "the absence of internalized
ethical or moral standards of conduct", i.e. conscience, and in
general "displays an amorphous hostile disregard of society".&gt;

<p>
<a name="0625qlink1">I would want to know the motivation of this "respect for the rights of
others" in order to predict the individual's behavior in a "two men in
a boat with one coconut" situation.  How likely is it that he would not
optimize his survival chances by rejecting sharing.  Remember, that
in a "state of nature", i.e. where neither Government nor Law nor
institutionalized enforcement of Law exists "Might makes Right" is
the prevalent ethic.  In terms of the case you describe, I predict
he would seize the coconut and throw the other man overboard if
superior in physical strength.</a>

<p>
<a name="0625qlink2">Now there is something called a "hedonistic calculus" to describe the
cunning displayed by an asocial individual (just as some autistic adults
have learned to impersonate emotional states and pretend to feel
the feelings of others) who is shrewd enough to realize that it is
<a name="0639qlink1">in his best interests to avoid the APPEARANCE of selfishness and that
displaying the respect you describe is the easiest way to induce the
cooperation of others.</a>  The is NOT a morally-significant "respect" --
it is simply a case of an unstable symbiosis which in an emergency
can deteriorate to parasitism and finally cannibalism.</a>
