I don't think that this is correct.  There is a major historical example of 
the misuse of patents that might be worth considering.  In the 1920' - and 
thereafter - RCA, Philco, Motorola, etc. entered into an enormous patent war 
over electronic circuitry.  Thousands of electrical engineers did nothing 
but invent every concievable circuit design for no other purpose than to get 
a patent to freeze out the competition.
<br>
Meanwhile, the REAL intellectual property rights were very poorly protected 
by the patent system, as in the well-documented case of the inventor of 
television, Philo T. Farnsworth (or have I forgotten his name - correct me 
if I'm wrong) versus RCA's Sarnoff.  Farnsworth didn't make a penny off his 
invention and I believe that RCA has a Sarnoff Institute or some such thing, 
honoring the thief.
<br>
I have always been a strong upholder of intellectual property - as in 
software piracy, etc. - but now I'm starting to shift in my thinking.  When 
I see some of the BS software patents that have gone down - patents of 
totally obvious ideas that the patent holders are counting on no one 
opposing successfully until it's too late - I start to worry.
I would be very surprised, for example, if Microsoft were not deliberately 
waging patent warfare against LINUX and any other possible competition, 
acquiring patents on all kinds of key software and just sitting on them 
until it's time to strike. Suddenly major LINUX software suppliers could 
find themselves put out of business by rich legal teams, or having to pay 
Microsoft royalties.   What a dismal prospect!
Somebody say something cheerful, please....
