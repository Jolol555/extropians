<a href="1300.html#1345qlink1">&gt;I wouldn't call Mahat MaGhandi "week-minded", nor Hans Kung, nor Adin</a><br>
<i>&gt;Steinsaltz, nor Amir Aczel, nor Phillip Clayton, nor Alan Sandage, or  Joel</i><br>
<i>&gt;Primack, or the Dalai Lama, or  Charles Townes or...I wouldn't call any of</i><br>
<i>&gt;these people weak-minded.</i><br>

<p>
I would. In a way. However "brave" or "principled" they were, if they have
to believe in the tooth fairy because they can't handle reality, well,
that's a form of weakness in my book - but it doesn't mean I hate them or
something. I don't accept that anyone sane can possibly be stupid enough to
buy religion on it's non-existent rational merits. There has to be some
alterior motivation for the active preservation of the delusion.

<p>
<i>&gt;But it makes me wonder if your definition of</i><br>
<a href="1300.html#1345qlink2">&gt;atheism, comes from, perhaps, a rebellion against fundamentalist or</a><br>
mainline
<br>
<a href="1300.html#1345qlink3">&gt;Christian Culture?  Which was the original point of my addition to this</a><br>
<i>&gt;thread.</i><br>

<p>
I don't call myself an atheist. I'm merely a rational person. I suppose my
non belief in Santa is some kind of rebellion too.......I suppose it can't
possibly be simply because I don't NEED religion to live my life, as I don't
NEED santa. I fully understand why people do, though, and as I said before,
I'll never think badly of anyone for having any form of belief....as long as
they don't start using it as an excuse to hurt people. Then I can become
VERY intolerant.
