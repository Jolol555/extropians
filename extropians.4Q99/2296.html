So those Shadows "killed" Kosh with their bare claws, but nothing else could
touch him?  Bah!  I think Vorlons are exactly as bulletproof as those
invisible monsters the Shadows like to breed - you just have to use some
real firepower on them, that's all.

<p>
Of course, I don't recall the episode you're referring to, so maybe I've
missed something.

I can forgive any authors for not having a Singularity - it kind of gets in
the way of the story, after all.  However, they should at least give their
aliens some token degree of progress (preferably something comparable to
20th century Earth).  As far as I can tell the B5 universe has some kind of
inverse exponential progress, where the more you know the harder it is to
learn something new.  How else do we explain the fact that the Mimbari lost
only one vessel in their genocidal war against humanity, but the young races
are actually able to inflict significant casualties on the Shadows?

<p>
Of course it was necessary for the plot,<a name="2444qlink1"> but to me that is just a sign</a> that
B5 is a fantasy story dressed up in SF trappings.  Nothing wrong with that,
I suppose, but<a name="2304qlink1"> it leaves the Vorlons with no more 'older and wiser'
credibility than Tolkien's elves.</a>
