Actually, for endothelial cells, for blood vessels, its probably just
about a done deal.  The angiogenesis factors were isolated over the
last 2 years and the growth factors (e.g. fibroblast growth factors
of various types) have been known for many years.  Lots of work
has been done trying to suppress endothelial cell growth after
angioplasty.  If the Geron work is correct, endothelial cells
are quasi-replicative (like liver cells) so getting a supply
of them and inducing them to grow isn't difficult.  You can
probably "3-D-implant" into the plastic the angiogenesis
factors and/or endothelial cell growth factors and have
no problems getting blood vessel growth where you want it.

<p>
Cells "naturally" have the ability to induce blood vessel
growth in hypooxygenation conditions, so even if you didn't
program the blood vessels, you could still get them if you
start out with stem cells in the right "stage".

<p>
I believe there is also work currently being done for smooth muscle
cells for artery growth (smooth muscle cells surround the endothelial
cells in larger vessels) and this is very close to going into
clinical trials (in bypass operations).

<p>
Nerves will be tougher in terms of "wiring" nerves into existing
connections, but given the spinal cord work I suspect this will
make rapid progress as well.   There are probably multiple growth
factors and/or chemoattractants that remain to be isolated for
nerves however (but obviously big pharma wants them badly).

<p>
So, I'd be optimistic on the low end of Greg's time estimates.
Given the likely supply competition between the pig-engineered
and lab-engineered approaches these areas should advance rapidly.
