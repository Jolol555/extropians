JPL MARS MICROMISSION CONTRACTOR SELECTED FOR NEGOTIATION 

<p>
     NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has selected Ball Aerospace 
&amp; Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colo., for negotiations as the 
spacecraft contractor on the Mars Micromission -- the first in a 
series of small, low-cost piggyback missions to send science 
probes, instruments and communication relay satellites to the red 
planet. 

<p>
     The contract will be negotiated over the next two months and 
is contingent on funding approval by NASA for the Mars 
Micromission Project.  This decision is expected by February 
2000.

<p>
     The Mars Micromission Project is planning to launch a series 
of a small 220-kilogram (485-pound) low-cost spacecraft to Mars 
as piggyback payloads on the French  Ariane 5 rocket when it 
launches commercial communication satellites into an Earth-based 
geosynchronous transfer orbit. From Earth orbit, the Mars 
Micromission spacecraft will use on-board propulsion and an 
innovative trajectory involving Lunar and Earth flybys to send 
the spacecraft on the proper trajectory to Mars. The launch 
services will be provided through the NASA partnership with the 
French space agency, Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), 
at no cost to NASA. Launch of the first Mars Micromission 
spacecraft is planned for spring of 2003 from the Ariane launch 
facilities in Kourou, French Guiana. 

<p>
     The design of the Mars Micromission spacecraft is based on a 
common spacecraft bus concept, which can be configured to deliver 
one or more science probes to the Martian atmosphere or carry 
extra propellant for orbit insertion into Mars orbit. The 2003 
Mars Micromission would be a communication/navigation orbiter, 
the first of a constellation of Mars-orbiting satellites that 
would make up the Mars Network.  The Mars
Network is intended to dramatically increase the data returned to 
Earth from future landed or orbiting Mars missions by providing 
efficient relay communications, while also providing navigation 
capabilities like those of the Global Positioning Satellite 
system.

<p>
     "The combination of the common spacecraft design and the 
piggyback launch is essential to achieve the Mars Micromission 
Project goals of frequent low-cost access to Mars," said David 
Lehman, the JPL project manager for the Mars Micromission. "We 
plan to be able to launch at least two Mars Micromission 
spacecraft during every Mars opportunity, about every two years. 
About half of these spacecraft are expected to carry out focused 
science investigations selected through competition, while the 
other half will be used to build up the Mars Network of 
communication relay and navigation satellites." 

<p>
     The Mars Micromission Project is managed by JPL for NASA's 
Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C., as part of the ongoing 
Mars Surveyor Program. The purpose of the Mars Micromission is to 
increase the quality and quantity of the science and technology 
data from the Mars Surveyor Program.  JPL is a division of the 
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.
