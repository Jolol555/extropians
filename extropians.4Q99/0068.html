NEW MARS IMAGES: NO EVIDENCE OF ANCIENT OCEAN SHORELINES

<p>
     Scientists studying high-resolution images from NASA's Mars 
Global Surveyor spacecraft have concluded there is no evidence of 
shorelines that would have surrounded oceans that may have once 
existed on Mars.

<p>
     One argument that such a body of water once existed was 
suggested by features in images from the NASA Viking missions 
taken in the 1970s, which were interpreted by a number of 
researchers as remnants of ancient coastlines. The images from 
Mars Global Surveyor, taken in 1998, have a resolution five to 10 
times better than those that Viking provided.  With this closer 
inspection, none of these features appears to have been formed by 
the action of water in a coastal environment. 

<p>
     "The ocean hypothesis is very important because the <br>
existence of large bodies of liquid water in the Martian past 
would have had a tremendous impact on ancient Martian climate and 
implications for the search for evidence of past life on the 
planet," said Dr. Kenneth Edgett, a staff scientist at Malin 
Space Science Systems, San Diego, CA, the institution that built 
and manages the Mars Orbiter Camera onboard the spacecraft. "The 
newer images do not show any coastal landforms in areas where 
previous researchers -- working with lower resolution Viking 
images -- proposed there were shorelines."

<p>
     About 2 percent of the Mars Orbiter Camera images were 
targeted to look in places that would test shorelines proposed by 
others in the scientific literature. 

<p>
     "Even on Earth, looking for ancient shorelines from the air <br>
or space is a challenge," said Dr. Michael Malin, principal 
investigator for the camera at Malin Space Science Systems. 
"Despite these difficulties, we believe these Mars Orbiter Camera 
images of the proposed shorelines are of a high-enough resolution 
that they would have shown features indicative of a coastal 
environment had there been an ancient ocean on Mars." 

<p>
     The paper containing these new conclusions was published in 
the October 1 issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research 
Letters. 

<p>
     One area that might have been a coastline is located 
northwest of the great volcano Olympus Mons.  Researchers looking 
at Viking images have suggested that there might be a cliff 
separating the western margin of the Lycus Sulci uplands from the 
lower-elevation, smoother Amazonis plains. The proposed cliff 
looked like the kind that forms on Earth from erosion as waves 
break against a coastline.

<p>
     Three high-resolution images were taken of this proposed 
coastline. The uplands are roughly textured, while the flat 
plains appear smoother. The image shows that the contact between 
the two regions is clearly not a wave-cut cliff, nor are there 
any features that can be unambiguously identified as coastal 
landforms, according to Malin.

<p>
     "While the suggestion that Mars at one time had oceans <br>
cannot be ruled out, the foundation for the 'ocean hypothesis' 
developed in the 1980s on the basis of suspected shorelines 
appears now to have been incorrect," Malin concluded. "However, 
it should be understood that there is significant other evidence 
of water on Mars in the past, both from Mars Global Surveyor and 
from previous missions. Today, the Mars Orbiter Camera continues 
to acquire new high-resolution pictures, each one helping to 
search for clues to the very important question of the role of 
water in the evolution of Mars."

     Mars Global Surveyor is the first in a long-term program of 
Mars exploration, known as the Mars Surveyor Program that is 
managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of 
Space Science, Washington, DC.  JPL's industrial partner is 
Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Denver, CO, which developed and 
operates the spacecraft. JPL is a division of the California 
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.
