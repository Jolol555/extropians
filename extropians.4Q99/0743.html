<i>&gt; Sorry Mike we don't agree on this one. The vast majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists in this country are Union, and even the doctors are</i><br>

<i>&gt; for all workers by the effort of Union labor.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<a name="0770qlink1"><a name="0749qlink3">Unions once were an effective means of collective bargaining, and may
still play a part in some professions, however any profession that is
based on knowledge and intelligence has no rational need, IMNSHO, for a
union unless there evolves some sort of monopoly buyer of professional
labor. Unions were needed when there were only three steel companies,
one oil company, three car companies, etc, and anyone who worked in
those industries was dependent on those companies for their living. If
these conditions are not met, then it is the union that is trying to
manipulate and extort the market.</a> The ABA, the AMA,  the NEA and others
<a name="0749qlink4">are IMHO manipulative, extortionary unions that should have anti-trust
actions taken against THEM.</a>

<a name="0770qlink2">It is no accident that in the US only 14% of private sector employees
are unionized while 37% of government sector employees are unionized. It
shows that the extortionists are clumping together at the center of
power. In the private sector, no company can maintain pricing control
over the market to pass off extortionate union demands to the consumer
for long, as there will always be a non-unionized alternative in the
free market that can compete better than the unionized firm.
<a name="0749qlink5">Stockholders will thus maintain pressure on management to prevent
excessive union concessions.</a> In the government, since union lobbying
money is not limited, the government employee unions are the most
powerful voice, which is why taxes and budgets always go up, or never go
down for very long. The politicians do not effectively represent the
taxpayer as shareholders in the political corporation.
