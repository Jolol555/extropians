Sherry,

<p>
   Sorry how late I'm jumping in here on the conversation (been very busy at 
the hospital).  However, I can confirm that study is being done on whether 
magnetic fields could be useful in the treatment of depression and other 
emotional disorders.  I've spoken personally with at least one neurologist at 
the University of Florida who is looking into the possibility.  Seems they 
are using magnets similar to those used in MRI, but with even higher Tesla 
strength (if I remember correctly), and that can be focused on small areas.  
One of the advantages UF has is they have access to the the high energy 
magnet lab being developed at Florida State University in Tallahassee.  I had 
heard others were looking into the possibilities, but wasn't familiar with 
the work at Pennsylvania.  Thanks for bringing it up.

<p>
Glen Finney
