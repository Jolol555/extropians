<p>
Ah, but do we "judge" things as "good/bad" or do we respond from a visceral and
biological and genetic basis to elements of our environment? Perhaps we ought to
consider (or stop denying) the biological/genetic basis of value judgments.

<p>
<a href="2151.html#2162qlink2">&gt;I understand the humor here, but it is funny because of the merit of the</a><br>

<p>
best = the most successful

<p>
"becomes" mutable? When did nature ever display anything other than mutability?
Evolution, especially societal evolution, _requires_ mutability. But the
pervasiveness of natural mutability does not necessitate a denial of objective
science, as "Cultural Studies" would like to persuade everyone.

<p>
<a href="2151.html#2162qlink4">&gt;Your formulation above reveals that you seem to value "extending</a><br>

<i>&gt;explicating WHY that is a fundamental value is important and may well not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;within the realm addressable by the scientific method.</i><br>

<p>
Explicating why sentience (or super-sentience) represents a fundamental value
does not pose a problem if we take a moment to look into it. It represents a
fundamental value because it answers questions -- even questions such as this
one -- and therefore, and thereby, validates itself. Scientifically, we can
observe this fact in our own consciousness: the value of sentience resides in
its ability to inform us of value. Circular? Perfectly.

<p>
Explicating why extending and amplifying our (accurate and relevant) sentience
constitutes a fundamental value to a non-carbon-based entity may present a real
challenge. When the opportunity presents itself, I'd like to have a go at it
(for the betterment of science and the ascension of life, as well as for the
challenge).

<p>
Cheers,
