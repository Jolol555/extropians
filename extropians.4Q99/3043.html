The process is as follows --
<br>
<a name="3129qlink1">Use nanotech grown solar arrays to harvest sunlight at 30% efficiency,
then use the electricity to split water, then use the H+ ions
running across a membrane embedded with the F0F1-ATP-synthase
to synthesize ATP, then use the ATP to generate all of the
proteins, carbohydrates and fats you need for food.

<p>
You up the general energy conversion efficiency from solar to
something useful from ~0.1-1% for animals &amp; plants to about 20-30%.
In the process I suspect you turn a lot of farmland back into
forest.
