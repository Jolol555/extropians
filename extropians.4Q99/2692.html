*Quantum fuel for future computers. Research suggests how software<br>
marketplace might change.  Imagine a world where software is computational
fuel — churned out by a processing plant and shipped down an optical-fiber
pipeline to your computer, where it’s consumed and destroyed. That just
might be the model for a future generation of quantum computers, new
research suggests. (MSNBC Nov. 25 99)

**Nanovation Technologies in the Toronto Star. Shedding light on the<br>
photonics era
<br>
 THE UBIQUITOUS computer chip, based on silicon, has radically changed the
world in which we live. But as silicon approaches its physical limits in
miniaturization and speed, we are moving into a new world, based on the
properties of light, the world of photonics, which will herald the next $1
trillion industry.

innovative technologists and scientists under the age of 35. Profiles of

the arrangement of matter. (long interview)

*Turkey Day, Silicon Style. High-Tech Startup Will Be Buzzing This Weekend.<br>
In San Francisco’s up-and-coming SoMa district, a group of engineers and
developers are huddled together this Thanksgiving in a second-floor loft,
working feverishly on a new project. And believe it or not, they’re pretty
thankful.  Backflip.com, formerly known as the iTixs Project, is a “secret”
startup founded by a pair of Netscape Communications alumni.

*A Crystal with a Twist ( 24 Nov.99 PRF)<br>
Doubly twisted. PET(R*)-9 is the first polymer crystal with twists along two
different axes, although only one of them is visible in this image. The
needle-like particles are not part of the polymer but were used to find the
polymer's orientation within the crystal. As in the famous line from the
1967 movie "The Graduate," the importance of polymers in modern life can be
expressed in one word: plastics. To develop new polymer-based materials for
the future, researchers want to understand and manipulate polymer structures
at the molecular level.

*It's heresy, but time running backwards could explain dark matter. The<br>
universe may contain regions where milk would stir itself out of coffee and
eggs would un-break, according to a physicist in New York state. The idea
that there may be regions where time runs backwards could explain invisible
dark matter. This kind of matter, invoked by cosmologists to explain the
movement of galaxies, could originate in a future contracting phase of the
Universe. (New scienctist Nov 27, 99)

*It's likely that quantum computing will, in the future, be a<br>
reality.However, making algorithms for them is not going to be trivial as
they don't function at all like our traditional digital computers. To
facilitate this, Open Qubit wants to emulate them. The emulator won't run at
nearly the speed of a real quantum computer, but it should at least be
helpful for developing algorithms before we finish developing the computers.

*Apply Quantum Principle with Caution (19 November 1999 PRF)<br>
Cold collisions. This simulation shows atoms in a two-component
Bose-Einstein condensate at a temperature near 1 nK, where Bohr's
formulation of the correspondence principle fails most dramatically. In the
early 20th century physicists realized that classical physics fails to
explain atoms, even though it works well for baseballs and planets. Part of
the early atomic theory relied on Niels Bohr's correspondence principle,
which states that the quantum theory must agree with the classical theory in
situations where the classical theory is accurate.
