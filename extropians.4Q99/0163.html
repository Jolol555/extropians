<p>
Yeah, I'm replying to my own post&lt;g&gt;.

<p>
Found some papers on this guy Herr's concept of a UV laser taser, which they 
are claiming will be able to create an ionized channel of air without doing 
significant harm to the body (effects on eye seem to be brought up).  Check 
out the patent and some of the articles on the proposed weapon.  Sounds like 
there is still a lot of work to be done, but does the physics add up?  Anyone 
have any hard data on what it takes to sufficiently ionize the air for 
something like this to work?

<a name="0168qlink1">And here's the summary from the patent for his UV laser taser:

<p>
&lt;&lt;SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 

<p>
The principal object of the instant invention is to provide a non-lethal 
immobilizing weapon for use by military or law enforcement personnel. 

<p>
A second object of this invention is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing 
weapon which is inherently safe in its operation. 

</a>
<p>
A third object of this invention is to provide a non-lethal weapon which is 
capable of temporarily immobilizing a target subject without causing pain, 
<a name="0168qlink2">shock, disorientation, or loss of consciousness. 

</a>
<p>
A fourth object of this invention is to provide a non-lethal weapon which is 
capable of temporarily immobilizing a target subject without his being aware 
of the cause. 

<p>
<a name="0168qlink3">A fifth object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon whose range is 
</a>
<a name="0168qlink4">substantially greater than prior related weapons that use wires or conductive 
</a>
liquid streams. 

<p>
A sixth object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon which can be 
<a name="0168qlink5">fired from a remote location without requiring the physical impact of solid 
or liquid matter upon the target. 
</a>

<p>
A seventh object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon which can be 
<a name="0168qlink6">directed continuously and swept across an indefinitely large number of target 
</a>
subjects. 

<p>
An eighth object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon which can 
<a name="0168qlink7">rapidly be fired toward a specific location on a single target subject, or to 
</a>
<a name="0168qlink8">a specific target subject among many because of the highly directional nature 
</a>
<a name="0168qlink9">of its current-conducting means. 

</a>
<p>
<a name="0168qlink10">A ninth object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon which has a 
significantly longer service life than prior related weapons. 

</a>
<p>
These and other objects are achieved by transmitting relatively high 
frequency electrical impulses to the target by means of one or two 
electrically conductive channels of ionized air produced within one or two 
beams of intense ultraviolet radiation aimed at the target, and by placing a 
high-voltage field of the opposite polarity across the path of each beam. 

<p>
The present invention functions by immobilizing the target person or animal 
at a distance. It performs this function by producing skeletal muscle 
tetanization in the target subject. Tetanization is the stimulation of muscle 
tissue by a series of electrical impulses of such frequency as to merge 
individual muscle contractions into a single sustained contraction. The 
immobilizing tetanization is maintained as long as the weapon continues to 
produce an electrical current within a major portion of the skeletal 
musculature of the subject, and for a brief time thereafter due to paralysis 
caused by the temporary inhibition of neuromuscular impulses. The optimum 
current and frequency required to create and maintain immobility while 
avoiding impairment of cardiac or respiratory activity are 25 milliamperes 
and 100 hertz, respectively. Currents in the range of 20 to 50 milliamperes 
and 5 to 2500 hertz may also be employed, with the higher frequencies 
requiring higher currents. A frequency of about 2 hertz may ultimately be 
used to produce painful spastic contractions. A minimum electrical potential 
of approximately 600 volts is required to overcome skin resistance without 
producing burns. 

<p>
The most effective current waveform in producing tetanization is that which 
most closely duplicates the physiologically produced neural impulse. As 
Offner points out, this waveform is an exponentially rising pulse. The second 
most effective waveform is a square wave, whereas the least effective is a 
sine wave. Due to their rapid risetimes, square waves allow the greatest 
penetration through the clothing and skin of the target subject. 

<p>
Further, the differences in the effectiveness of various waveforms constitute 
an inherent safety factor in the operation of the instant weapon. This safety 
factor is a result of the rapid absorption by biological tissue of the 
harmonic frequencies within complex waveforms such as square waves. A 20 to 
50 milliampere current is thus able to stimulate only the target subject's 
skeletal muscles, and cannot penetrate to the autonomically-controlled 
internal muscles such as the heart. 

<p>
A lethal variation of the present weapon could be implemented by increasing 
the current above approximately 250 milliamperes. A sine wave current having 
a density of about 5 milliamperes per square centimeter that flows through 
cardiac muscle for more than about two seconds may initiate ventricular 
fibrillation. The duration of the current needed to cause ventricular 
fibrillation is inversely proportional to the current density within the 
cardiac muscle. 

<p>
The current carried by the ionized air channel is limited by the number of 
free electrons within the ultraviolet beam. A minimum 20 milliampere current 
required to induce skeletal muscular tetanization can be carried by a gaseous 
channel with a concentration of 10.sup.8 ions per cubic centimeter. This 
concentration is most efficiently achieved in air by ionizing molecular 
oxygen with coherent or columnated incoherent ultraviolet radiation having a 
wavelength of 193 nanometers. Shorter wavelengths may be employed as optical 
technology progresses. 

<p>
At its normal operating intensity and a wavelength of 193 nanometers, the 
ultraviolet beam is safe to the skin because it cannot produce more than mild 
erythema akin to a sunburn unless it is directed at the same location for 
many minutes. Moreover, it is safe to the eyes because wavelengths near 193 
nanometers cannot penetrate the cornea to reach internal ocular structures 
such as the lens and retina. 

<p>
At this wavelength, molecular oxygen has a two-photon ionization cross 
section of 1.times.10.sup.-34 cm.sup.4 /watt. Because of its low ionization 
threshold, the number of photons required for ionization, and its large 
proportion in the atmosphere, it is easily able to create sufficient electron 
density. 

<p>
The most efficient source of 193-nanometer radiation presently available is 
the argon fluoride discharge-pumped excimer laser. A reasonable power 
density, pulse duration, and pulse repetition rate for this laser is 5 
megawatts per square centimeter, 10 nanoseconds, and 200 pulses per second, 
respectively. 

<p>
An argon fluoride laser with an aperture of 1 square centimeter has a power 
density (energy output) of 10 millijoules per pulse or 1 megawatt per square 
centimeter. Each pulse liberates 6.3.times.10.sup.6 electrons, or 
6.3.times.10.sup.14 electrons per second in the air immediately outside the 
aperture. A power density of 50 millijoules per pulse or 5 megawatts per 
square centimeter liberates 1.6.times.10.sup.8 electrons during each pulse, 
which is equivalent to 1.6.times.10.sup.16 electrons per second. 

<p>
A narrow beam of ultraviolet radiation may also be generated from the 
collimated emission of an ultraviolet lamp. 

<p>
The electron density in the channel of ionized air is a function of the ratio 
between the electron production and loss rates. In both the two-body and 
three-body electron attachment processes, the delay time between the end of 
the laser pulse and the beginning of the high-voltage tetanizing pulse 
determines the number of available electrons. When the electron energy is 
only 0.1 electron volt, for example, the three-body attachment is rapid, and 
the steady-state electron density for a 193 nanometer, 5 megawatt per square 
centimeter beam falls to 8.times.10.sup.7 per cubic centimeter. 

<p>
The range of the present weapon is determined by the rate at which the laser 
beam is absorbed by the atmosphere. A 193-nanometer wavelength beam is 
attenuated in dry air at about 1.times.10.sup.-4 per centimeter. It will thus 
propagate approximately 100 meters before its intensity is decreased to 1/e 
of its initial value. As a consequence, the 1.6.times.10.sup.8 electron 
density at the aperture of an argon fluoride laser with a power density of 5 
megawatts per square centimeter falls to 2.2.times.10.sup.7 after 100 meters. 
Because the minimum electron density required to transmit a current is 
between 10.sup.6 and 10.sup.8 per cubic centimeter, the above ionized channel 
should conduct the tetanizing current at least 100 meters. The range of this 
weapon could be increased, however, by the use of a more efficient 
ultraviolet source. 

<p>
Various techniques, including those suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 4,017,767 Ball 
and U.S. Pat. No. 5,175,664, Diels et al. which are incorporated herein by 
reference, may be used in order to enhance the multi-photon and collisional 
ionization along the laser beams. These techniques are well known to persons 
skilled in the electrical arts.&gt;&gt;
