<p>
In the aftermath of John Grigg's useful cross-posting of recent material from 
cryonet, I would greatly appreciate an informed update on the state of the 
art in cryonics.  I've been signed up with Alcor for a few years now, and I 
was pleased to see what appeared to be a grudging acknowledgement that they 
may be the best of a bad lot.  

<p>
I discerned from the material John forwarded that the vitrification process 
Darwin et al. have developed appears to be far superior to past and current 
methods.  Can someone better informed about Alcor's inner workings report on 
the status of adoption of that technology?  I've seen somewhat cryptic 
references in Alcor's magazine to negotiations being underway between Alcor 
and 21st Century Medicine (Darwin's group?).  Is this meant to indicate that 
Alcor is attempting to revise its preservation protocol?

<p>
Any overview from someone closer to the cryonics cognoscenti would be greatly 
appreciated.
