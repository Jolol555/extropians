I haven't read Dow 10K, though I did read the Amazon reviews, and I have
read some of the Dow 36K articles.

<p>
Shiller is a very good economist, and I see no reason to call his analysis
more "technical," vs. "economic," (whatever that means) than any of the
many other analyses on this important topic.  Noting the historical average
of 11% is just looking at the average Y value of the graph at the URL above,
and ignoring what the X value tells you.  Now you might have reasons to
think that the correlation the graph shows is spurious, but I can't see
how just using the average Y value is somehow less "technical."

<a name="1134qlink1">As Hal nicely pointed out, you really have to believe that the economy
has changed in fundamental ways to justify current prices.  You might
decide that investors no longer demand a risk premium (the Dow 36K argument),
or that computers, the collapse of communism, etc. have fundamentally
changed the economy.  Maybe, but do keep in mind all the reasons
people had to believe in 1929 that the world had fundamentally changed.
Arguably one of the century's best economists, Irving Fischer, published
a book in '29 about how the world had changed, and he convinced Yale to
invest all their endowment in stocks then.  Ouch.</a>

<a href="1102.html#1106qlink2">&gt;Robin, would you care to make a Julian Simon/Paul Ehrlich style bet on</a><br>
<i>&gt;stock prices ten years from now? (The difficulty will be in agreeing on an</i><br>
<i>&gt;index to use.)</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1112qlink1">Doing this bet in the market, with each of us just investing according
to our beliefs, would minimize our transaction costs and risks of not
being paid.   The main difference between a bet and straight stock plays
is that bet losses are capped.  But with the right options, we should be
able to reproduce that in the market too.  So, ... anyone know what the
longest timescale is we can buy S&amp;P500 or some such options in current
markets is?  If it's 10 years or more, we should do that.
