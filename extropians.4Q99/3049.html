Harvey, I have to disagree here.  You cannot use the these statistics
alone to discuss something like ZPG, you have to use the demographics
profile in its entirety.  Right now the baby-boomer generation is
in the middle of its reproductive years, so the births are exceeding
deaths.  The figure you *really* need is the population doubling time.

<p>
For example, see "Technology Needs of Aging Boomers", by Joseph
F. Coughlin (from the Age Lab at MIT), in the Fall, 1999
"ISSUES in Science and Technology", Figure 2, shows a relatively
uniform population-age distribution around 2030 with an est.
U.S. population of ~304 million, not too much larger than the
2000 population of ~268 million.  While not ZPG, the doubling
</a>
time is very long (probably hundreds of years).  As Fig 1
of the article points out, the estimates are that in 2040,
77 million of the U.S. population will be over 65 (these
people usually aren't having many children...).  You have
to take into account some very complicated rates of change
in offspring produced per individual when you discuss ZPG.
My impression is that in Western economies, Mick's claim
is correct (that educated middle-upper class individuals
are producing ~2 children/couple).  Perhaps this may be
due to an awareness of the relative costs of producing
and educating a child likely to be successful in the
anticipated environment (this runs upwards of half a
million dollars I believe).

<p>
All of this says that education and awareness lowers population
growth rates.  Why invest in children when you can invest in
oneself [other than to satisfy subconscious genetic drives]?
Organizations, such as The Hunger Project are well aware of this
and that is why they place an emphasis on educating women,
increasing their earning potential, etc. so that they can
put themselves in a position of being something other than
a baby manufacturing facility.   { None of these comments
are intended to deny the pleasures associated with having
or raising children so long as it is realized that those
pleasures are "pre-programmed" into your being. }

<p>
Now of course, all of these predictions are *ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS*
(loud shouting *intended*) because they fail to take into account
technological progress for things like extending lifespans
(which will bump the population growth rate) or uploading
(which will decrease the "physical" population growth rate).

<p>
You *really* don't want to get me started on the issues involved
in predicting population levels, social security economics,
economic growth unrelated to knowledge growth, etc.  

<p>
Razzzum, frazzum, incompetent, illinformed, moronic, diluted salt-water
for brains, sub-octopodes, unworthy of being uplifted or uploaded,
