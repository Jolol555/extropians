<a href="1986.html#2090qlink1">&gt;      I am currently reading and selecting books for a reading list. I would </a><br>
<i>&gt; like to include a book on critical thinking, seeing through logical </i><br>
<i>&gt; fallacies, separating emotion, sentiment and cliches out of arguments...</a>that </i><br>
<i>&gt; sort of thing. I searched Amazon.com and found 2 or 3 that look good, but I </i><br>
<i>&gt; would like to hear your recommendations and opinions.</i><br>

<p>
Maybe 'The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark' by Carl Sagan 
fits into your query.  It is not primarily a 'textbook' about logic (although 
it contains elements of that); Rather, this book is an active attack on all 
kinds of mysticism and sloppy emotional/sentimental thinking, and exposes the 
illogicalities, but also the cruelty and dangers, in a large set of examples 
of non-rational acting and thinking.  I like this book.  I think this book 
will remove a lot of prejudices and sloppy thinking in someone who reads it 
who is already halfway 'converted' to rationalism.  

<p>
(Sagan, the 'white knight' slaying the memes of irrationality in his readers, 
and leading them to the 'light' :-) of rationality.)

Best greetings,    Menno (rubingh@delftnet.nl)
