That seems like a good possibility, although I think Heinein tended to make
marriage groups much larger than is actually practical.  I suspect it would
be very difficult to maintain a group much bigger than 4-5 people, because
the number of interpersonal relationships involved becomes too large.
Besides, it was hard enough to find one person I wanted to marry - finding a
group that big would seem to require either impossibly good luck or rather
low personal standards.

balance varying depending on the orientations of the individuals involved.</a>
However, I can see plenty of other workable arrangements, from an open
version of the traditional marriage to various fluid forms of polyamory.  I
think the important rules are simply:


<OL>
  <li>  Be open and honest with each other about everything.
  <li>  Talk about and agree on the rules for your relationship up front.
  <li>  Don't try to put restrictions on your partner(s) for no good reason.
  <li>  Do insist on rules about the things that really matter to you.
  <li>  Be realistic in your expectations.


</OL>
<p>
Of course, this approach runs directly counter to the expectations of
Western culture.  After all, &lt;love conquers all&gt;, &lt;only love matters&gt;, &lt;your
head can't (and shouldn't) understand your heart&gt;, and "I do" comes just
before you segue to the happy ending scene, right?
