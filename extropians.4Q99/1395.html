<a href="1394.html#1395qlink1">&gt; Well, which is it?  You seem confused.  First you shout out that I</a><br>
<i>&gt; CAN PROVE IT.  (Pretty sure of yourself.)  Then you say, a little</i><br>
<i>&gt; quieter, "I can't PROVE the laws of probability..."  </i><br>

<p>
Please check the attributions..."I can prove it" was Clint, not me.
I don't care about proof, and said so.

<p>
<a name="1431qlink1"><a href="1394.html#1395qlink2">&gt; You say you've mastered the laws of probability.  That's nice.</a><br>
<i>&gt; How do we know they're real laws, not just some idea which has</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked out for you?</i><br>

<p>
In what way does "real" matter, except for the money in my pocket?</a>
<a name="1431qlink2">That's the point I'm trying to make: I don't have to have "faith"
in physics or math to bet on them and make money.  I just have to
make the bet, and I think it is rational to make the bet, even if
I have neither "faith" nor "proof".  There is a middle ground.</a>

<p>
<a href="1394.html#1395qlink3">&gt; Actually, this is not how most professional gamblers appraise a</a><br>
<i>&gt; positive expected value (e.v.) situation.  You're supposed to measure</i><br>
<i>&gt; your risk aversion (you should have some if you have finite money,</i><br>
<i>&gt; since you don't want to be wiped out) and use it to discount the value</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a particular e.v. further, to get a certainty equivalent (c.e.) in</i><br>
<i>&gt; dollars of the e.v. in dollars.  A standard technique is to compute</i><br>
<i>&gt; your "kelly" factor, which may be correlated to how much more likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; you want to make it that you double your stake before you would ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; see it drop by 50%.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1431qlink3">Yes, when I played poker for a living, I played a lower-variance game,
and did indeed sacrifice a bit of EV to prevent catastrophic loss
(though not by the Kelly criterion, because there are better ways).
I have a regular 9-to-5 job now, so I play high-variance high-EV</a> poker
and am willing to fade higher risk bets because I have savings to back
them up.  Over my year as a pro, I had an EV of 1.4 bets/hr, with a
variance of 10.  Now I play with an EV of 2.1 bets/hr, with a variance
of 19.  Those -50 sessions can be a killer :)
