&gt;&gt; That's in the textbooks, actually.  So Atkins is still posing as 
"persecuted"
<pre>
&gt;&gt;  when his ideas get wide acceptance *provided there is data*. Interesting.
&gt;&gt;  Sounds like he's trying to sucker in conspiracy theorists.

When you refer to the "establishment"  I assume you're referring to the 
scientific
<br>
and medical establishments, which have authority (kinda) to get things done.
Newspapers and such do say some goofy things but I don't think the LA Times
is the source of Atkins' or your complaints.

<p>
My point is that the knowledgeable people and the decision-makers are aware
of the data supporting (or not) Atkins' claims and make reasonable 
conclusions.
<br>
Where Atkins' claims have data, they agree.<a name="2811qlink1">  If ketotic diets were good and 
</a>
safe,
<br>
and if Atkins (or somebody else) were to do studies demonstrating this, 
ketotic
<br>
diets would become a standard part of the weight-loss arsenal (or anything 
else it's useful for).
