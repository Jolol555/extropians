<a name="1485qlink1"><a href="1480.html#1483qlink1">&gt;Not true.  There is a chance, no matter how miniscule, that a million </a><br>
<i>&gt;flipped coins will all be heads.</i><br>

<p>
I dropped out of the conversation for a while but after noticing this 
discussion was still going on I have to say this.

<p>
You're thinking statistics not probability.<a name="1486qlink1">  Probability is what actualy 
happens, what we actualy observe and statistics is what's supposedly 
</a>
probable in pure mathematics.

<p>
<a name="1486qlink2">Take the lottery for example.  Statisticaly any combination is just as 
likely as any other combintation.  But when you enter all those drawings in 
a database and do a comparison you notice that is not the case.  1 2 3 4 5 6 
does not occur nor any sequence of 6, by 1s, 2s, or what ever.  Why not?</a>  
After all, a number is just a mark.  A 3 is the same thing as a 22.  I don't 
try to explain such things (though I probably could if I cared to put the 
energy to it) instead I notice it has never happened compared to what has 
happened.  I make the logical assumption, based on observation, what</a> has 
happened the majority of the time will continue to happen.  So I get rid of 
all sequences of 6 in a possible combination and I greatly decrease my odds. 
(Note: I don't play the lottery, but it's fun to watch)

<p>
<a name="1486qlink3">So with coin flipping I compare the probability 50/50 based on the amount of 
flips I've already done and compare that to the statistical value of the 
possibility of it comming up heads that many times.</a>  I have an ~50/50 
compared to a 1/100.  1 is much greater than .001.  They can't both be true 
because that would be contradictory so I reason by the amount of gap 50/50 
will always happen while 1/100 never will.
