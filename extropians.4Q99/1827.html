"...If 'God' is a synonym for the deepest principles of physics, what word
is left for a hypothetical being who answers prayers, intervenes to save
cancer patients or helps evolution over difficult jumps, forgives sins or
dies for them? If we are allowed to relabel scientific awe as a religious
impulse, the case goes through on the nod. You have redefined science as
religion, so it's hardly surprising if they turn out to 'converge.'"
