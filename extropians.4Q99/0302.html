The question becomes what is regulating telomere "length"?  Is it
a property of telomerase itself, the chromosomes involved, etc.?
Then you get into the question of how they tried to regulate telomerase.

<p>
I can imagine that if you turned on telomerase permanently and
messed up any of the controls involved in telomere length it
would be uniformly fatal.

<p>
It is important to keep in mind that rodents are *not* good animals
in which to do anything with telomeres.  Mice for example have much
longer telomeres than humans and have a fairly different structure
in the sub-telomere regions.

<p>
You have to think about telomeres as an anti-cancer mechanism.
The telomere length or activity of telomerase has to be tuned
on an organism specific basis to match the cancer rates caused
by DNA damage.

<p>
    long telomeres = high cancer rates;
<br>
    short telomeres = low cancer rates;
<br>
too short telomeres = limited cell divsion, particularly in replicative
<pre>
                      tissues (or even failure to develop properly)
</pre>
really long telomeres = probably improper DNA replication/cell division (?)

<p>
It is probable that the relatively slow shortening of telomeres in
epithelial tissue contributes to skin aging, reduced pulmonary
capacity, certainly blood vessel aging and even poor nutrient
absorption in the elderly.  However those short telomeres are
what let humans have a relatively low cancer rate due to division
blocks on cells that get mutated and start dividing excessively.

<p>
The fundamental question to ask about telomeres is what are they like
in whales and elephants (that have very low cancer rates for their
cell #).  It looks like telomere length interacts with genes
with genes near the ends of 4+ chromosomes.  In whales/elephants
does nature increase the number of these "division" control elements?
Or do they have better regulation of telomerase?  Or a reduction in
DNA damage overall?  All of these things could allow a larger number
of cells with a lower effective cancer rate.

<p>
It is worth pointing out that turning on telomerase is not
a universal requirement for cancer development, you can get the
same results by fusing chromosomes in unusual ways.  Turning
on telomerase is one of the most common paths to cancer
progression however.
