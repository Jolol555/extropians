My guess is that octopodes are at least up to the bird (parrot)
level and perhaps up to the dog/pig level.   I don't think they
have a large enough brain for primate/dolphin level however.

<p>
But you might consider giant squids such as Architeuthis dux
or Taningia danae.  The can run from 2 to 18 meters in length
and weigh up to 900 kg (1,980 lbs).  I'd have to believe
that they have a relatively large brain as well.

<p>
Interestingly enough, these species would be relatively near the
top of their food chain and live in fairly safe and unchanging
environments and have good defensive systems -- a recipe for
allowing genetic programs for very long lifespans.
