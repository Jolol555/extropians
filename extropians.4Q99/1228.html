Some do, though they seem often, in painting, to combine some minimal
aspects, so it's not strict Romanticism.  And it's hardly strict Realism, as
the term is used in art circles.  The same goes for the literary works, of
which there are lots more.  It seems every Objectivist writer wants to write
that great novel!:)

I would say that's not a reason to damn it.  I would say that's an argument
ad hominem...<a name="1235qlink1">  I mean if Hitler liked using toilet paper should everyone</a> who
is against Nazism stop using the stuff?  I hope not!:)

Nazi art was rather cliche driven and more propagandistic.  However, there
was Leni Riefenstahl.  Her films are masterpieces -- albeit twisted
masterpieces.  This does not mean I agree with her politics or her lack
thereof.  (She was pretty much an opportunist, from what I've read.  She
didn't care for Nazi ideology, but it didn't bother her that she was making
films for that movement.)

<p>
Also, Rand's and Objectivist taste in art isn't just that sort of stuff
warmed over.  After all, most Objectivists see Capra (of "It's a Wonderful
Life" fame) as a great director.  This makes me laugh, but I doubt we'd find
Nazis, noe or otherwise, giving their thumbs up to any of Capra's films.
(And Hitler did convince Mussolini to pull "We the Living" from the theaters
in Italy.  This film based on Rand's novel of the same title was thought by
the Italian fascists to be merely anticommunist; in fact, it was starting
people to question fascism.:)
