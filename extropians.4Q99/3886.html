I found Damien's post very interesting.  I remember as a teenager coming 
across a copy of Olaf Stapleton's book and being enthralled by it with the 
quaint but fascinating approach it took to describing humanities future.  I 
had thought it was a work that had been simply forgotten and now I learn of 
all this!

<p>
<a name="3931qlink2">I have only read one novel of Lem.  I forget the title but the main 
character was an astronaut who returns to Earth after having been gone for 
centuries.  He is seen as a dangerous throwback in a world where everyone 
has been "treated" to be nonviolent.</a>  I remember how the cars had a crash 
avoidance system in them and he tore his out.  A popular actress wanted to 
make love to him because he was such a "savage" even though she experienced 
barely controlled terror around him.

<p>
<a name="3931qlink3">I knew of Lem's stature but never got around to reading any more of his 
books though I enjoyed the one I did read.</a>  I was fascinated to see that Lem 
had actually critiqued the book I had thought lost into obscurity when I 
found it in a used bookstore years ago.

<p>
One of my favorite stories in a somewhat similar vein is "Twilight" by John 
W. Campbell.  I loved how the visitor from the future catches a ride from a 
rather regular guy in a truck and tells him of the histroy of humanity.  Few 
stories as a young teen caught my imagination like this one did.  I need to 
go back and reread it.


<p>
sincerely,

<p>
