Hi Bryon,

<p>
You wrote,
<br>
<a href="2156.html#2161qlink1">&gt;What makes you think there's a difference between these two</a><br>
<i>&gt;things?</i><br>

<p>
Please excuse me butting in here (but), perhaps | what-we-ought-to-do | and |
what-we-can-do | belong in different categories because, although we ought to do
everything we can do to augment, expand, increase, improve, and intensify life,
the very idea of doing so implies that some things diminish, devalue,
disintegrate, destroy, and demean life. So, we ought to do the former, while not
doing the latter, because doing the latter will (eventually, inevitably)
preclude us doing anything more.

<p>
Partial explanation: Don't do things that prevent doing more things (because
doing so removes the possibility of learning more about what we ought to do,
which may comprise a special set of things to do, or not to do). "Cultural
Studies" forms an intricate facade behind which to go back to sleep and stop
considering the ongoing spectacle of complex evolution that science continues to
uncover (and technology continues to accelerate).

<p>
"Keep on truckin'"
