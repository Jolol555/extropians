<a href="0409.html#0435qlink1">&gt;While I realize it might offend the libertarian sensibilities of many here</a><br>

<p>
No offence taken, I just hope you aren't affended as I start shooting a few 
holes in your theory.

<p>
<a href="0409.html#0435qlink2">&gt;I must say I could not disagree with this more. The increase of the </a><br>
<i>&gt;education level of the general population is a desireable thing in and of </i><br>
<i>&gt;itself, if for no other reason than it makes each individual more a more </i><br>
<i>&gt;productive contributor to the economy.</i><br>

<p>
Desirable for who?  The people themselves?  Who makes up the people?  
Individuals.

<p>
<a name="0443qlink1"><a href="0409.html#0435qlink3">&gt;Are you suggesting _all_ education be optional? How many 7-year-olds do you </a><br>
<i>&gt;know who have a thirst for knowledge? By your scheme, we'd have a </i><br>
<i>&gt;generation of functional illiterates who can't read a street sign or </i><br>
<i>&gt;multiply 6x7. Guess what happens to your personal standard of living when </i><br>
<i>&gt;the economy tanks because of the ensuing labor-quality crisis? When there's </i><br>
<i>&gt;nobody around to run the machinery, the machinery stops.</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="0443qlink2">Actualy, those 7-year-olds who don't aquire a thirst for knowledge, dispite 
motivational efforts, and aren't forced into school by their parents will 
grow up to be 10 or so when they decide to get a job.</a>  After finding out 
that employers won't hire them because they can't read or right they learn 
they need to learn and school may be a way to do that.  There will be plenty 
of other people who can read and write because employeers demand it.  I know 
you can teach children the value of money and how it's earned.  Also, lets 
not forget home schooling.  I can picture a future of mass education via the 
internet and other media.

<p>
<a href="0409.html#0435qlink4">&gt;A little government saying "You must learn enough to have the potential to </a><br>
<i>&gt;be a productive member of society" isn't a bad thing; it's crucial.</i><br>

<p>
And if you don't you probably won't survive.  It's your choice not the 
governments!
