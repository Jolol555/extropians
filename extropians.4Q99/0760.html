<a name="0779qlink1">Reads a bit like nonsense I'm afraid. There is no flatter bit of an
exponential curve; it looks the same forward and back (I'm taking some
liberties), no matter where you stand on the curve. Multiplying by a
constant amount per constant time period (like multiplying transistors per
square inch on an IC by 2 every 18 months), says that the rate of change</a></a> is
constant.

<p>
<a name="0776qlink2">This relates to the concept of a singularity perhaps. The notion that
technology and other stuff (that's the technological term) increase so much
that things go batso (also jargon) - I assume that the rate of change of the
various exponential curves involved is constant.</a> I also assume that people
can adapt (and indeed have adapted) to a constant<a name="0776qlink3"> rate of change - look at
the computer hardware industry. Acknowledgement of Moore's Law (and design
with it in mind) shows that people can cope with constant change,</a> as long as
it is predictable.

<p>
<a name="0779qlink2"><a name="0776qlink4">So what we are concerned with re: singularity is not increasingly
accelerated change; that's most likely not to happen.</a> What is more important
</a>
is the qualitative thresholds reached in what<a name="0776qlink5"> we can accomplish as this
predictable constant increase in technology advances. Moore's law (and other
exponential increase) is not a direct threat,</a> but it may (should) lead to
such things as nanotech, strong AI,<a name="0776qlink6"> intelligence augmentation, etc, which
all constitute qualitative changes to the human landscape. Then new curves
</a>
are created...
