&gt; &gt;James Daugherty]  ...Lost 25 lbs in about 6 weeks following the Adkins<br>
&gt; diet...<br>

<p>
Aw heck, thats nothing.  I lost 80 pounds in 3 days.  Found a matchbook, said
"LOSE WEIGHT!  1 dollar a pound.  555-2345."  So I called, she said "Yes sir,
how much would you like to lose?"   Figuring it was a scam and not wanting to
risk
<br>
more than ten bucks, I says "ten pounds."  She says "Very well, sir, put a check

<p>
for 10 dollars in the mail, and we will send out our 10 pound representative at
8 oclock in the morning."  So I did and 8 the next morning the doorbell rings
and when I opened the door there stands this fetching brunette, nekkid as the
day she's born!  She said nothing, just handed me a card, which read:  If you
can catch me, you can have me.  So I started chasing, chasing, chasing, caught
her, had her, stepped on the scale, 10 pounds lighter!  Called back, said:
"I wanna lose 20 pounds!"  She says "Very well, sir, put a check for 20 dollars
in the mail, and we will send out our 20 pound representative at 8 oclock in the

<p>
morning."  8 the next morning the doorbell rings and when I opened the door
there stands this stunning gorgeous blonde, nekkid as the day she's born!  This
one was *twice* as comely as the 10 pound representative, hands me a card, If
you can catch me you can have me, but she was also twice as fast as Miss 10
Pounds, so i started chasing chasing chasing, and then chasing chasing chasing,
finally caught her, had her, lost 20 more pounds!  So I was *really* excited
then!  Called back, said I wanna lose 50 pounds!  She says "Sir, 50 pounds is
a lot of weight to lose in one day..."  I says "I dont care!  The check is in
the
<br>
mail, now send out your 50 pound representative at 0800!"  Next morning I
get up real early, shower, cologne, rose in the teeth and running shoes only,
0800, the doorbell rings.  I go open it up and there stands a 400 pound gorilla,

<p>
nekkid as the day he was born.  Hands me a card:  If I catch you, Im gonna
fuck you.
