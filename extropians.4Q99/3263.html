Well...this was either in the sixties when I was still at home...or in the 
70's sometime when i was home on leave.  I don't recall when some of those 
conversations took place.

My uncle wasn't a teenager but he most like had a machine gun. He was a 
gunsmith in his spare time.  I recall many a conversation regarding the 
merits of AK-47's vs M-15's....a pity he didn't live long enough (brain 
anurism) to get into those conversations with my son...and avid gun enthusist.
