<p>
Even with all the responses to this thread, my example still stands.  In a
beehive, the breeding queen could not survive without the nonbreeding
drones.  The hive evolved so that both kinds of bees are required.  My point
was merely that evolution can and does produce individuals that do not
produce.  It is not necessary for every single individual to reproduce.

<p>
My point is just that gays are not "obviously" an evolutionary mistake due
to their lack of reproduction.  It is simply not true that childless animals
are not part of evolution.  This is a common misconception among
nonbiologists.  Any genetic factors that affect behavior of some individuals
affects the social group.  Any factor that affects the social group could
enhance or threaten survival rates.  Any factor that affects survival rates
will steer the course of evolution toward a "fitter" animal.

<p>
Another good example would be predators, which clearly thin out a herd so
that only the fittest survive.  They are clearly part of the evolutionary
process, even though they do not breed or produce new animals within the
herd.  Predators are not evolutionary dead-ends or deviations.  The are
nonbreeding examples of evolution in action.

<a href="2898.html#2921qlink1">&gt; &gt; The difference is that [workers] share many of the genes with the queen</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and with the other bees.  I'm not sure of the details, but they may even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; all be clones of each other.  At least that's how it is with ants.  It</i><br>
is
<br>
<a href="2898.html#2921qlink2">&gt; &gt; because the workers share so many genes with the reproducing organisms</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that group selection works effectively with hive insects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Without such close kinship, group selection has a weak effect and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will tend to be dominated by individual selection.  An individual who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reproduces will tend to have more of his genes propagated than one who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; does not but who benefits the group as a whole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; All worker bees in a hive are effectively sisters, so they pass on their</i><br>
<i>&gt; genes by supporting the queen as a sister factory.  It was once thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; that this genetic arrangement was necessary for eusociality to evolve,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but this has since been overturned by naked mole rats and other fully</i><br>
<i>&gt; eusocial animals that have different genetics.</i><br>
