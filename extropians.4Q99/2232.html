whether some functions can be performed by mechanical systems.  Your

<a name="2294qlink4">Exactly who has performed such an experiment, when, and under what

no one has ever needed to do</a> it.  Biosphere definitely falls into the
overcomplex, naturalistic approach that I argue against.

<p>
I notice that you still fail to actually list any specific problems with the
simple approach to long-term life support.  Is this, perhaps, because you
can't name one?
