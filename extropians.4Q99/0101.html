Fuck that. You're insane.<a name="0111qlink2"> Face rec, in and of itself as a technology
is one thing -- putting that technology to use is another.</a>

Cameras are all over the place, some of them watch the streets. What
would stop John Q. Officer from watching me walk along the street,
match my face, and just pull up my file for the hell of it? Nothing. 

<p>
The officer is ID'ing me without my consent. If said officer _tried_
to stop me as I walked along the street, I could legally refuse to
give him my ID unless he decides to detain me, which he needs probable
cause to do. Is this later ability _abused_ .. you bet your ass it is,
but at least I can get the asshole's badge number! So why the fuck would I
give him the ability for further abuse when I can't get his badge number
and at least try to keep things on the level? Makes no sense. 

<p>
Sure.. if I don't have a record they can't ID me, blah blah.. DMV records
(ala, my picture) will be available legally or otherwise at some point,
you can count on that. 

<p>
Even if I'm a criminal, this still sucks ass.. even as a criminal if I'm
walking the street, not commiting a crime I should be treated the same
as any other citizen ..
