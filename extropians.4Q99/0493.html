Whoa, how did we get from pornography to beauty?

<p>
Now, someone correct me if I'm off the wall, but IMO, the purpose of
the literature/pictures/movies/etc. (ranging from erotica to pornography)
is to stimulate you to the point where you have an orgasm.  Now the purpose
of the big O is to satisfy those biological "urges" that you have done your
duty to your "gene copying" drive.  While the social/cultural/intellectual
part of your mind may be making value judgements (re: beauty) [you mean
to say you [are attraceted to|slept with] him/her?!? (how gross...)]
and there probably is an undercurrent of attraction/repulsing driven by
pheromones, the bottom line are the drives to impregnate or be impregnated.

<p>
Now the whole thread about "removing the sex drive" is in my mind
about removing the "satisfaction" associated with orgasms.  It has
to be operating at the lowest level of your genetic drives.
Presumably if this is done correctly, then you would no longer
be stimulated by the aforementioned material or odors, etc.

<p>
Interesting, that could imply that their culture or genetic heritage
has "reality gravity".  I could imagine a situation (say where there
is more pheromone sensitivity) where the orgasm is simply not as
satisfying unless it is the "real" thing.

<p>
As I believe I've mentioned before, since the economic investments
in procreation are different for males and females it makes sense
on the genetic programming side that males are more highly stimulated
by such things (even to the point of raping females, esp. those of
"other" tribes).  Females on the other hand have to be more level
headed about the whole process due to the greater investment.
Bottom line: sperm are cheap.

<p>
Standard disclaimer: I'm not suggesting in any way that this is the
way it "should" be, I'm simply suggesting that this is the way nature
has designed it.

<p>
Now, since I'm probably already waist deep in the mud with some people,
I might as well see if I can drown myself.

<p>
I'm reading an interesting piece of Victorian erotica now and it
discusses the excitement that some men and women derive from "spankings".
It is also true that spankings potentially bring more blood into the
sex organs possibly making the nerves more sensitive.

<p>
The question is -- does it simply stop there (at physiology) or is
this something deeper, i.e. the tip of the iceberg where violence is
required to fullfill sexual desires?  I believe that the anthropologists
say the only two "natural" situations in which primitive people resort
to violence are a lack of food and a lack of mates.

<p>
I guess that explains prime time TV...  Sex and violence interlaced
with munchie commercials.
