I'm currently reading a book.

<p>
Meme Machine by Susan Blackmore.

<p>
She defines, defends and expands on the original concept of meme's as 
presented by Dawkins.  In fact dawkins wrote the preface.

<p>
It's fascinating....and scary......and explains EVERYTHING.

<p>
Basicilly it boils down to this.  After all the interesting stellar evolution 
and stuff things settled down enough for chemistry to start cooking up 
organics.  Eventualy a replicator appeared.

<p>
Call this replicator a gene.  

<p>
Thence all of biology.

<p>
For some silly strange reason (as yet unknow although there are interesting 
speculations...my favorite being heat radiator for cursorial hunters) one of 
the species of biologicals developed a HUGE brain.

<p>
This humongous brain was analogous to the "primal ooze"  for meme's....in 
other words  a second replicator developed in conditions which favored it's 
doing so.....the human brain.

<p>
This replicator, the meme,...is entirely mental...an information virus so to 
speak.

<p>
And that's all there is too it.

<p>
No god's ...no aliens...no grand design.  Just replicators trying to 
replicate.  Like germs in a swamp.   (turn on a TV..or take a walk in a 
mall....see what I mean?....meme's everywhere...trying to get into your mind 
and breeeeeeeedd)

<p>
<a name="1706qlink1">Humans have two kinds of replicators working on them unlike every other 
biological known.  Consequently this explains why humanity is so ascendent 
over everything else.</a>  I beleive the word factorial is interesting in this 
regard.

<p>
A key concept to keep in mind is that meme's could care less (metaphorically 
<pre>
speaking of course.....because meme's ...like genes....dont care at 
all)......about what's good for gene's.  All meme's are "trying" to do is 
replicate.  That's what replicators do.  That's All they do.

</pre>
<p>
Hence relegion......looney tunes......and  soap operas.....mental viruses 
trying to infect and breed.
