<a name="0611qlink3">Well, presumably it is "built-in" because it enhances survival.
We have recently isolated the genes responsible for controling
circadian rhythms and have begun to unravel how they are
"reset" by such phenomena as daylight.  Obviously animals
that hunt by sight want to get an early start and be on
the playing field when the sun comes up.  Similarly prey
of the nocturnal variety wants to wake up and come out
when it gets dark.</a>

I've always been amazed at my ability to wake up in
advance of my alarm clock (if I program myself to do so).
In theory my brain should be "unconsious" when I'm asleep
but the internal clock seems to never sleep.
