But don't you experience it yourself, and isn't that data?
The problem<a name="3683qlink1"> with this type of data is that you cannot experience other =
people's consciousness. You can rely on reports from them, but you have =
no idea if they are lying, or making it up after the fact. And even =
assuming they are always correct and always telling the truth, you have =
no idea if the qualia associated with an experience they report is the =
same as the qualia you are experiencing, or if there is ANY qualia =
associated with their experiences. I believe that ultimately there is no =
<pre>
way around this. This makes it an extremely difficult experiment to =
broach scientifically. An individual could do certain things to his =
brain and study the effects on qualia, and, I suppose, make his own =
</pre>
science which has validity to him, but if his experiments are not =
reporoducable in others, they may very well see it as "superstition". =
But, should the scientist who did the experiments and experienced the =
effects consider it superstition? Should anyone except those who</a> do not =
directly experience qualia (if any exist) consider their existence to be =
hypothetical and superstitious?
