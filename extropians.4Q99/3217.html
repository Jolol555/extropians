Robert,

<p>
The explaination given to me by people in the credit industry is that
the transactional cost of collecting all the small monthly payments is
quite high, and that the default rate on credit card debt is quite high
also.

<p>
However, good long term customers can individually get rates between
7.9% and 11.9% fixed.  The lower rate usually comes with large credit
lines which would fit with the transactional cost point made by my
banker friend.

<p>
<a name="3225qlink1">Another thing that plays a big part in credit interest rates is a
persons net worth.  If you have even a modest net worth,(most people
have 0 or negative net worth) the interest rates fall because they know
you are much less likely to default and file chapter 11 if you have
something to loose.</a>

<p>
When I was broke and in debt my credit card rate was 17.99% and my
credit line of all cards combined was about 7000 dollars. Now that I'm
no longer broke and don't use my credit for much I have 100's of
thousands of dollars worth at 8 or 9 percent.  I always thought it was a
joke that once you didn't need credit that bank would give you all you
wanted, but it seems to be true.

<p>
Another interesting thing I have found as my wealth has increased is
that I no longer pay all the banking fees I used to have to.  No loan
app. fees, no checking fees, no fee for purchasing travelers checks,
etc.  It is strange that the people who can afford the fees don't have
to pay them, and the person for who every dollar counts is expected to.

<p>
I think your idea for a bank is a good one, and much more possible than
it would have been even a few short years ago.  Regulations are tuff,
but the rewards would be there for those involved.

<p>
Lee
