<a name="0073qlink1">Depends how you define success!</a> For some, the degree itself is the goal.

<p>
<a name="0073qlink2">The only people I ever hear who bag on education are people who don't have it 
and are bitter. I love education, and am totally self taught.</a> I've earned 
several Ph.D's worth library, writing &amp; studying tiem on VARIOUS  subjects, 
but I don't have a scrap of paper or one initial to list after my name*.  I 
just love to learn! I know stuff I never use!

(*except  .MUSE )<br>

Make no mistake: People who have those intitials and licenses - hold a huge 
advantage!!!!!!! (Just as one doesn''t NEED to be born wealthy to accumulate 
wealth it sure helps!!!! - and - on the other hand, the anger at disadvantage 
can be the very thing that propels one in the real world.)

<p>
I never went to art school -- got a degree -- thankfully, because that art 
school can really jack up an artist's brain.

<p>
But I agree with Lee, there are professions and situations where the system 
is firmly in place -- and you will not get what you want unless you have 
credentials, licenses, etc.  - and he's right, often one can't always stop 
work long enough to get the degree!! 

<p>
<a name="0073qlink3">Even though I'm happy to be degree-less I don't need to justify it by sayin' 
Gates or Einstein share that distinction.</a>

<p>
; )

<p>
And I forget who mentioned this but the networking aspects are huge.

<p>
I would have a lot more work (even in set painting for TV and theater, or 
music) , if I had gone to Harvard or Yale - having nothing to do with my 
ability -- i know less talented guys who have big paying jobs at compnies 
like Dreamworks, granted by bigshots who share universities.
