ExtroCanucks -

I would like to point out that Canadians are everywhere... There are over 1 
million transplanted Canadians in S. California alone!  In fact, (the last 
time I looked), my wife Rochelle was a transplant from Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
She married me, another  typical, sun-beaten Los Angelino, CA  native.  So, 
do not be deceived.  Even though Canadians look the same as us, the giveaway 
is when they say 'about', it sounds like 'a-buut'.

<p>
So, listen well!
<p>
         Eh?

Canadian infiltrators are everywhere!!  These are obviously frightening 
times as they cross the border to steal all our jobs and marry our citizens 
to spread those Canuck genes!  We all need to be alert for the tell-tell 
signs that the "American" next to you is
actually... one of them! :)

Look at this website to uncover the truth of Canadian treachery!

Well, I had a roommate who was a Canadian from Calgary.  Often other 
Canadians would come and visit us and I found them all to be very good 
people.  Ardent hockey fans, funloving yet still very courteous and 
seemingly better educated then most just out of highschool guys from here in 
the states.  I did have to put up with repeated viewings of "Strange Brew," 
denunications of the French-Canadians and lectures on the contributions to 
world peace by the Canuck military but aside from that they were nice to 
have around.  I suppose I am a Canuck sympathiser at heart.


<p>
sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
