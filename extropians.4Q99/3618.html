     &gt;Qualia to me seems to be the experiencing of our own neuro-chemical

    &gt;reactions<br>

<p>
So chemical reactions are warm and fuzzy but electrical reactions are
cold and logical? It doesn't seem likely.

If an AI doesn't also have that ability how on earth could it be intelligent?
Hell, even today's programs can do that.

<p>
Yes, of course it would.

<p>
A much better question is, what would AI's use us for anyway?

<p>
<a href="3594.html#3618qlink4">    &gt;Qualia is a distraction to getting the job done!!!</a><br>

<a name="3688qlink4">The job random mutation and natural selection wanted to get done is survival,
if qualia is just a handicap to that then why did evolution give it to me and
perhaps to you too?</a>
