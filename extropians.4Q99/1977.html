If technological progress is open-ended, any hostile Power that isn't part
of your own society will either be far more advanced than you are (in which
case you can neither fight it nor run from it) or far less advanced (in
which case you are invulnerable to it).  This follows clearly from the fact
that biological evolution is many orders of magnitude slower than
technological progress.

<p>
If progress eventually comes to a halt, then you get a situation where all
SIs are of comparable sophistication and the results of combat depend
primarily on who has most resources.  In this case combative Powers would
rapidly be forced to mobilize all the mass in their environment for
defensive purposes - either as physical weapons, as computing devices
devoted to information warfare, or (more likely) as some combination of the
two, plus whatever infrastructure is required to support them.

<p>
Neither case predicts the sort of scenario you suggest.
