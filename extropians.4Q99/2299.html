<p>
In fact, John, two young Mormon fellows visit me every week-end -- not for
the purpose of religious conversion, but to discuss theological matters and
the relationship of Religion to Society.  Of course, I have been educated in
the Doctrine in the process, and consider it a valuable addition to my knowledge
 base.  At least my visitors do NOT have a seige mentality, but a very
mature attitude toward ideological wars.

<p>
My question is: what wait?  Why not launch a non-lethal pre-emptive strike?
Mission: to demonstrate that an ideological attack would be self-defeating,
and to emphasize common points, like the belief in the perfectibility of human
life (without getting lost in purely semantic issues)?
