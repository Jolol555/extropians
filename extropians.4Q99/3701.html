Not much.  Tried that one too.  Frogs and Grasshoppers make willing
astronauts.  Never had one object too much, and they seemed none
the worse for their flight into the stratosphere.  {8^D

This one was not so super secret.  The one we spent a few bucks on
was the vacuum chamber.  We had one about the size of a single car
garage.  Some guys and I were arguing about the effect of the ambient
air on moment of inertia measurements.  I set up the torsional pendulum
in the vac chamber, pumped the air out, found out even I had underestimated
the effect, and I was the high guesser.  Wrote up a technical paper
on the experiment, received the nickname "spike", won best
presentation at the conference, got a job offer at Lockheed, took
it, and here I am today.  {8^D  spike
