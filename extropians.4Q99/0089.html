<a href="0088.html#0089qlink1">&lt;&lt; One idea would be to have the nonlethal </a><br>
 weapon incorporate GPS technology and a transmitter which would notify the 
 authorities when the weapon was fired and where (of course this would make 
 doing a little target practice with your weapon hard...could probably go to 
a 
<br>
 firing range which would be deemed a free weapons release zone during 
 operational hours).  Also could build in a small camera that could upload 
 pictures of what was being shot at. &gt;&gt;

    Please note that most of this was first stated by Jeff Davis in his 
posting.  Sorry, I forgot to put in the credit on the original posting.
