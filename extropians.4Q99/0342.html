<p>
<a name="0356qlink2">"large enough to physically move the synapses around" is a remarkable
understatement. One of these days I should really scan some of these
freeze-substitution etch EM slides vs. controls. Bad, bad, bad.

<i> &gt; Ralph Merkle goes into some discussion about this in his reanimation</i><br>

<i> &gt; map the surfaces and gradually pull things back into the proper locations.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0356qlink3">Of course this assumes that they know what the proper locations
are. It is _impossible_ to predict the original shape of color clouds
in a glass of water after stirring it a little.

Some of what happens during freezing (=NOT vitrification) is
comparable to above case.

<p>
<a href="0206.html#0342qlink4"> &gt; If you have ever seen a freeze fracture electron micrograph you can</a><br>
<i> &gt; easily imagine how mating the two ~mirror-image surfaces back together</i><br>
<i> &gt; should be straight forward.  If the chemical cocktails work really</i><br>

<p>
It is sure straightforward, but the problem only occurs with
macroscopic cracking. Fixing cracking with nano is trivial; it's just
a DSP problem.

<p>
<a name="0356qlink4"><a href="0206.html#0342qlink5"> &gt; well, then you should be able to do the reanimation without nanotech.</a><br>

<p>
If you could redo Suda's stunt using vitrification and modern signal
processing techniques on the EEG that would really be impressive news.

<a name="0356qlink5"><a href="0206.html#0342qlink6"> &gt; If it turned out that the physical location of the receptors within</a><br>
<i> &gt; a synapse (rather than just their overall "density") was significant</i><br>
<i> &gt; things would be more difficult.  But I doubt very much that the cells</i><br>

<p>
Freely diffusable ion channels are a pathological case. Pathological
both in restricted to certain types/locations and ischaemic trauma.

<a href="0206.html#0342qlink7"> &gt; The brain has a lot of redundancy and can probably tolerate a fair</a><br>
<i> &gt; amount of "mismatching" before you would experience significant</i><br>
<i> &gt; memory or self-awareness loss.  You might start out fuzzy, but</i><br>
<i> &gt; over time neuronal maintenance &amp; repair should normalize things.</i><br>
<i> &gt; Much more serious would be large regions of damage in some specific</i><br>
<i> &gt; critical brain region.  I'm under the impression however that the</i><br>
<i> &gt; brain is one of the tissues more tolerant of freezing.  The kidney</i><br>
<i> &gt; is the difficult one due to the microstructure it requires for</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0356qlink6"><a name="0345qlink1">Recently (as in yesterday) I learned there is a rare type of brain
trauma (20-30 cases/year) which wipes out the entire memory
irreversibly, leaving only algorithmic memories. This leads to
frequent divorces, because the original personality is wiped out. Fun,
huh?
