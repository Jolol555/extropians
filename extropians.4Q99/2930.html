However genes in combination work in mysterious ways.  For example you
have gene imprinting wars regulating, I believe, IGF-2 (insulin like
growth factor-2) where the male side wants large fetuses and
the female side wants small fetuses), and the genes involved in altering
sperm motility (Nature Nov. 11, 1999 &amp; Science 286:1269 (12 Nov 1999)),
where it takes a combination of genes for fast sperm and slow sperm
(both "distorter" and "responder" proteins) to get "normal" sperm.

<p>
<a name="2969qlink3">These are probably just the tip of the iceberg</a> for "wierd" gene
combinations in nature.  When I speak of "natural", I mean combinations
of genes that will "promote" the reproduction of those genes.  Anything
else is self-defeating (from the gene's perspective).
