Exactly:  "Buy low, sell high!"  It sounds obvious, but most people don't do
this.

My business partner bought Apple stock a couple of years back when it was
$12 a share.  It looked like Apple was about to go out of business and
Microsoft was way up.  Everybody thought he was crazy.  Of course, a couple
of years later, Apple comes out with the I-Mac and markets the fastest
mass-market computer.  His stock is worth 10 times what he paid for it.
Microsoft is still high, but it hasn't grown 10-fold.

<a name="3522qlink1"><a name="3520qlink1">Max is exactly right.  You don't want to buy a stock after good news.  You
want to buy it before good news, and then sell it after everyone else has
bought</a> in.
