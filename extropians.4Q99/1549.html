    The only "cure that I have ever heard of for sleep that is available 
right now is to eat less, much less.<a name="1584qlink1">  There is a guy by the name of Wliey 
Brooks who</a> seems like more of a nut case than anything else but he apparently 
hasn't eaten in years.  I have heard of people who have done this before.  
When I was in Bavaria last year my cousin took me to the grave of Terese 
Nueman, a woman who will probably be sainted by the Catholic Church in years 
to come, and it has been very well documented that she had fasted for years 
at a time.  There have also been a number of other Catholic saints that have 
supposedly gone for years without food and survived only on Communion wafers 
once a day or once a week.  How much truth there is to this I don't know but 
I think there could be something to it scientifically.
Here is the guys web site if you want to check it out.
