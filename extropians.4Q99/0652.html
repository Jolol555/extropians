<a href="0611.html#0652qlink1">&gt;You have applied this concept as I intended to do, but I</a><br>
<i>&gt;didn't want send a post of unconventional length.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt;what a relief!  I have experimented with the placement</i><br>
<i>&gt;of digital and analog clocks, set the alarms of two such</i><br>
<i>&gt;that one is set to the desired time, another to either a</i><br>
<i>&gt;time before or after the desired time, and so on, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;the result is invariably the same, regardless of how long I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have slept: I always wake up spontaneously just in time</i><br>
<i>&gt;to turn the earliest alarm off!  No one I know shares this</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience -- except, now, you!  I'm at a loss to explain</i><br>
<i>&gt;it, although those who claim to practice "lucid dreaming"</i><br>
<i>&gt;or who assert that "out of body experiences" occur in</i><br>
<i>&gt;fact would probably explain it that way. These accounts</i><br>
<i>&gt;do not satisfy either my curiosity or my intelligence.</i><br>

<p>
I do this too, as well as serveral of my friends.  I can set the alarm to go 
off 1 hour after I've gone to bed and wake up exactly 1 minute before the 
alarm goes off.  It doesn't matter what time I set the alarm I'll always 
wake up exactly 1 minute before the alarm goes off.

<p>
I do have an answer for this that is kinda bizzare.  My friends conversate 
with me when I sleep.  It can be about any subject and I can be dreaming any 
dream and I'll respond and communicate just as I would if I were awake.  
I've been told a few times I've actualy sat up and looked at them (eyes 
open) and talked even though I was fast a sleep.  Having lived on my own and 
not many people visit over night I don't know if I still do this, but I 
think perhaps we all have someother consciousness that keeps track of things 
like time.

<p>
I can picture someone reading this saying I must have multiple personalities 
but I doubt that because people who have them don't remember events while 
they do them.  I learned to create and destroy personalities at will and I 
always remember and am always in control. I think because I've done so much 
exploration of my own mind mainly through meditation and while sleeping 
(being aware I'm sleeping and controlling my environment while monitoring 
what's going on) that I continue to do so sometimes without thinking about 
it.  That would explain being able to talk to someone while I'm a sleep.

<p>
If anyone has simular experiences at this level I would definately like to 
hear about them.
