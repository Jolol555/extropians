Hello KPJ,

<p>
<a name="1000qlink1">With all due respect, this sounds more like a right-wing political
platform that an Extropian philosophical position.  Surely you're
not suggesting that a subculture with this group is presuming to
regulate the content of List posts.  That wouldn't do at all.</a>

<p>
<a name="1000qlink2">The phrases above all appear to be related in some way to
early American political documents which have become laws
difficult of interpretation, even by the Supreme Court. Stated
baldly as above, they are really quite meaningless, and I wouldn't
know HOW to question them unless I knew what they meant.

<p>
But only "natural law" is of any interest to me philosophically in
any case, although of course I haven't the faintest idea what
you are talking about. Any process of analyzing the nature and
logical status of your concept is out of the question.</a>

<p>
Best regards,

<p>
Bob
