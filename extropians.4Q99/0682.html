<p>
    well, much grass to ya and all, but please, be careful about what you 
assume is *just* me and my attempts to be as cool as emlyn. the protein 
remark, above, while an attempted joke ("yes, a joke. hahahahahahahaha" -- 
data), was also an attempt to illustrate that your hypothetical solipsist is 
a shortsighted feeb (please note that i am not calling you shortsighted or a 
feeb, or any combination of the two). you seem to assume that solipsists 
necessarily have no ability to understand or take into account the long-term 
consequences of their actions. i dont follow ya there.

<p>
&gt;  The essential motive<br>
<a href="0639.html#0682qlink3">&gt;  for my posts is a desire to engage in "networked cognition" for the </a><br>
analysis
<br>
<a href="0639.html#0682qlink4">&gt;  of difficult social issues. "Individualism Reconsidered" by David Reismann </a><br>
some
<br>
<a href="0639.html#0682qlink5">&gt;  years ago was an early effort to discover whether "self-determination" in</a><br>
<i>&gt;  the context of a densely interdependent social matrix, i.e. contemporary</i><br>
<i>&gt;  technological society, had any real meaning.</i><br>

<p>
    interisting. i think i can understand, in that while my goals include 
being completly self-sufficient, as of right now, i buy food from stores. so? 
thats just another thing that being a self-aware++ upload could fix. i fail 
to see how the current situation (or any situations where temporary 
dependence on others is necessary for survival) would modify the long term 
goals...

<p>
<a href="0639.html#0682qlink6">&gt;  So think about this: is "Extropian Commune" an oxymoron?</a><br>

<p>
    i dont know. it seems to me that 'extropian' as an adjective as lost some 
of its meaning lately, and im not sure what, if anything (or if anything 
should), differentiate/s extropians from transhumanists in general. so, ive 
got den otter's transtopian principles in my current enlightenment theme 
background... while not intending to disparage the extropian principles (i 
still dig em, but...), i really think that they dont take a very explicit 
stance on some important issues. the transtopian principles do. alright, so 
maybe im part of the transhumanst extremists; or exptropian hardliners; or 
whatever... o well; so what? words dont refer to reality, etc... &lt;/rant&gt;

<p>
<a href="0639.html#0682qlink7">&gt;  For example, in the event of massively disruptive social sabotage by any</a><br>
<i>&gt;  current terrorist organization (and I am in a position to know that there </i><br>
is
<br>
<a href="0639.html#0682qlink8">&gt;  no workable firewall in place, that we are totally vulnerable to e.g. </a><br>
Anthrax
<br>
<a href="0639.html#0682qlink9">&gt;  agents and small plutonium-based ordinance), could Extropians organize</a><br>
<i>&gt;  small communes that required intense cooperation with an emphasis on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  group rather than self actualization?  Is there any alternative here to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a paramilitary model requiring the imposition of discipline when necessary?</i><br>

<p>
    i think that, given the generally innovative and adaptable nature of 
those who would describe themselves as (im workin on this e-prime thing, 
alright!) extropians, ya could nail a board with the non-coercion principle 
painted on it to "our" cave wall and the inhabitants would do pretty good by 
it.
<p>
    and i think that small groups can function very very well when the 
emphasis is on group actualization as a means to individual actualization. at 
least, i think i function best that way.
