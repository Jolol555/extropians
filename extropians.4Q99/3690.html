<a href="3673.html#3690qlink1">&gt; This is the problem. A zombie (which presumably does not - and cannot -</a><br>
<i>&gt; exist) is a hypothetical construct to point out why consciousness is so</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficult.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A more accurate question - if you were the zombie and someone asked you how</i><br>
<i>&gt; you knew you were not a zombie, how would you know? Well, you wouldn't be</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiencing anything, there would be no "you" to know or not know. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; were not a zombie how would you know? If you heard the questioner's words,</i><br>
<i>&gt; felt yourself considering it, or experienced any step along the way, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; would know that you're not.</i><br>

<p>
This is no help.  Surely the zombie would "believe" that he was
experiencing things, that he was hearing the questioner, that he felt
himself considering the question, etc.  Though I put the word "believe" in
quotes, since I'm using it in the functionalist sense of the term.
(Indeed, if I'm right, that's the only sense with any meaning.)

<p>
<a name="3692qlink1">Your answer amounts to, "well, it would feel different if I were a zombie,
that is, it wouldn't feel like anything at all!" but if you were a zombie,
you would think/say exactly that!  Sure, you can CLAIM that you have an
inner life, but you may be decieved in exactly the same way a zombie would
be deceived.</a>

<p>
<a name="3692qlink2">If you think that if "you" were a zombie, there would be no "you," then I
think the "you" you're referring to doesn't exist.  When I say "you," I
mean that thing sitting in front of a monitor reading this.  Whether that
thing has qualia or not is therefore up for grabs.</a>
