<a href="0695.html#0700qlink1">&gt;Additional recordings take place in our genes, in the cells of our</a><br>
<i>&gt;body. The DNA, that twisted ladder, is a molecule which is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;transmitter and receiver of wavelengths; this has already been</i><br>
<i>&gt;proven scientifically. In its structure, the DNA-molecule can</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply be compared to the ferrite antenna of a radio.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In other words, the gene is not only a precisely and finely</i><br>
<i>&gt;constructed material structure with a specific function, but this</i><br>
<i>&gt;molecule can also receive and emit vibrations. This means that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;sends and receives, each time on its own particular frequency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This antenna, the gene, is not only capable of receiving spiritual</i><br>
<i>&gt;and mental impulses, but also all types of radiations from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;cosmos which have an effect on the person, that is, radiations</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the stars as well as planets and radiations originating here</i><br>
<i>&gt;on earth.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0695.html#0700qlink2">&gt;Since each gene is a transmitter and receiver, this makes the</a><br>
<i>&gt;entire person a transmitter and, at the same time, a receiver</i><br>
<i>&gt;tuned to very specific frequencies by way of his programs.</i><br>

<p>
I was kicked back on Sunday in a big comfy chair with my copy of
"The Molecular Biology Of The Cell", and flipping through T.V.
channels when I came across a religious program doing a similiar
thing.

<p>
<a name="0741qlink1">This T.V evangelist was giving a credible explanation of some
immune system functions, but then turned it: "How is it possible
that this wonderfully complex system evolved from nothing?" The
answer he said was that it could not.

<p>
This is a new and potentially dangerous thing......These people are
capitalizing on peoples ignorance of basic science (like they
haven't been doing that for years) and supplying their own
explanation/opinion for the facts. We've seen this recently in the
anti-evolutionist stance in Kansas, where people confidently remark
that the evidence for evolution is wishy-washy at best, when the
exact opposite is the truth.

<p>
We have to counteract this pseudoscientific masturbation
