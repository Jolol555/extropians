<p>
Spike, you are correct.  Biology is a subset of MNT that is here now and
already has replicators. Some researchers call biology "wet nanotechnology" see:

<p>
<a href="http://pchem1.rice.edu/nanoinit.html">http://pchem1.rice.edu/nanoinit.html</a>

<p>
Biology is under study for clues to self assembly and other techniques, see:

<p>
<a href="http://itri.loyola.edu/nano/us_r_n_d/03_11.htm">http://itri.loyola.edu/nano/us_r_n_d/03_11.htm</a>

<p>
However, for wet nanotech to use carbon the way general MNT is proposed, we
would need to make enzyme systems than can put it together in ways that
biology just does not do at this time.  It may be possible to reach general
MNT through a large number of tiny changes to existing organisms, and some
biologists are thinking about this.  The basic idea calls for changing the
building
<br>
blocks of the cell in a "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" path. However, it
would not be so easy.

<p>
 It would require many generations of genetic engineering and organism growth
cycles
<br>
that researchers in that field would rather devote to projects in that field.
Especially
<br>
with an existing market for genetic products.  At each step the organism has to
be
<br>
able to live, so you cannot replace something vital until you have a fallback
system
<br>
in operation for that part.  It is possible that for some changes "you just can't
get
<br>
there from here" and you will have to back out and try again.

<p>
On the other hand, it is possible to use forced/directed evolution to put
millions of
<br>
organisms to work trying to find the solution to the problem in parallel.  If
generation
<br>
times are fast enough and mutations are frequent enough, and selection is clever
enough, you might (in a few years) get bacteria that start looking more like
general assemblers that can work with harder and harder materials.
