<i>&gt;A better way to do it, as Crocker and I keep saying, would be to break</i><br>
<i>&gt;up the system into modular components that could be more highly</i><br>

<i>&gt;schools can be credentialed by their own independent systems which would</i><br>
<i>&gt;compete for credibility with parents.</i><br>

<p>
They both can work.  I don't believe in bad students.  Of course there are 
students who misbehave (kick them out or find a new way to teach them) and 
students who don't learn very well (personalized learning programs in 
personalized-specialized-schools).

<p>
Picture this.
<br>
2 class rooms each containing 1 teacher 10 good students 5 bad students and 
3 retarded students.

<p>
If students in teacher one's class perform better than students in teachers 
two's class then teacher two is doing something wrong and if teacher two 
wants to get that raise or kip its job then teacher two will make an effort 
to learn teacher one's methods.
