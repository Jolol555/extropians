Hello everyone,

<p>
It has been about ten years at least since I last saw "Life of Brian" so I 
will have to do it again.  I remember seeing it with a group of my fellow 
Mormon missionaries on our day off to relax and do chores!  I don't recall 
it being blasphemous, just irreverant.

<p>
I have never seen "Name of the Rose" with Sean Connery.  I have always meant 
to but never get around to it.  I must make amends.

<p>
<a name="2065qlink1">For those of you who love a good historical mystery I recommend the "Brother 
Cadfael" series.  This is topnotch television viewing with the title role 
played by the very gifted actor Derek Jocobi.  Brother Cadfael is a monk and 
former crusader who uses critical thinking to solve crimes and murders 
during the medeival age.  He is a man out of time in a sense.

</a>
<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
