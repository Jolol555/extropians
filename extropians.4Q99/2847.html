<p>
On today's National Public Radio's Talk of the Nation, a panel was convened
on the topic of science fiction and science, comprised of:
<pre>
         David Brin (science fiction author)
         William Gibson (cyberpunk author)
         Ann Simon (lead consultant to the X-files)

</pre>
<p>
What was interesting was the prevalance of transhumanist themes in the
discussion. 

<p>
--some discussion centered on a new theme of optimism in science fiction<br>
and speculative fiction, where things go very well for humanity.  Verner
Vinge's singularity was mentioned in this part of the discussion 

<p>
--nanotechnology was mentioned as one potential path of development<br>

<p>
--a caller asked about the interaction between human and technology.  In<br>
the subsequent discussion, Gibson said "We are in some real ways posthuman,
and there is no going back from that."

<p>
--Ann Simon mentioned that the X-files is actually stimulating young people<br>
to consider careers in science, becuase it is one of the few places in
mainstream media where science and scientists are portrayed in a positive way.

<p>
--David Brin brought up The Transparent Society during a discussion of<br>
neoluddite backlash.  Ann Simon had just voiced her fear that there would
be an upheaval against other technologies patterned on the one now ongoing
against genetic engineering of foodstuffs.  Brin said that if a significant
portion of society turns its back on technology, it would actually create
the kind of elitist divide that the neoluddites fear in the first place.
He then described the concept of ubiquituous information and how it could
benefit everyone.
