In Islam people get hands choped off for stealing, but here in America we
have a constitution that state's it is illegal to conduct "Cruel and unusual
punishment." (Disclaimer here-that I am not expressing 100% support for all
American guidelines- but can at least feel safe knowing that in a wrongful
or alleged crime, one may perhaps complete undeserved time, and not be
maimed for life.) Another point, criminals do come in many forms, (including
wheelchairs).
