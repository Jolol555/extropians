As do many African Americans.  This was a flash point during my time at
Antioch.  My professor would just stand there and let people scream racism
for supporting genetics, robotics, etc.  And the day that I proposed that
humans are slowly leaving individual cultures behind in favor of a common
interface was the day I was informed that Hitler had fathered my mother.

<p>
The multi-culti movement has put itself into diametric opposition to any
technological advancement that promises to fundamentally alter the human
body.  Having fought so long and so hard for basic respect for their</a> own
cultures, they tend to view these technologies as yet another opportunity
to wipe them off the face of the earth.  Surely we can empathize with that,
but it becomes worrisome in that they may find themselves less adapted to
the future.
