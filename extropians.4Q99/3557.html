OK, why 10^26 and not some other number?

<p>
Now there you go again.  A relativistic nanoprobe caries enough energy to melt
a few cubic meters of shielding, but MBrains are supposed to have hundreds (or
maybe thousands) of kilometers of radiator systems between their computronium
and the outside universe.  Even the high-performance systems I favor could
<a name="3565qlink1">easily afford a kilometer or two of shielding.  Since even the most energetic
secondary radiation isn't going to penetrate more than a few hundred meters of
solid matter, that means that impacting nanoprobes are no threat at all.</a>

<p>
Besides, do you really think an SI is going to be that stupid of a target? 
For a relatively trivial mass/energy investment it could surround itself with
a network of sensors and directed energy weapons capable of eliminating such
objects long before they impact its surface.  Its going to want to do that
anyway to protect against more substantial threats (like large relativistic
objects), so why not invest a little extra effort to be thorough about it?
