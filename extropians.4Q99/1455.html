Elroy, Kansas(AP)  God, abandoning his long term policy of reticence and
reclusivity, has filed a class action suit, in the First District Court of
Elroy, accusing the authors of the books of the Old Testament and current
ministers of the Xtian religions, with criminal libel without intent to
defame.  He said that the suit has long been
overdue.

<p>
"I never said or did the terrible, sadistic things that are routinely
attributed to me in the OT,"  He said.  "I never slew whole tribes of
people, turned people to salt, caused plagues, or inundated the entire world
to chastise an errant people no matter how compelling the
provocation may have been.  Mine was a Kingdom of Love. The Holy Book, as I
wrote it in clear universal language, was an impeccable example of brotherly
love and inerrant writing.  Later translators and
ministers of the clergy have made a mis-mash of what was a clear and
endearing spiritual  message."

<p>
God also deplored the over emphasis on the importance of his only begotten
son.  "It should be "What Would God Say,' instead of 'What Would Jesus
Say,'" he mused in a moment of open frankness, attempting to correct the
record without unduly minimizing the importance of his son.  He pointed out
that the garden scene was not as depicted in the current bible.  Rather than
unauthorized eating from the Tree of Knowledge, it was unbridled consensual
sex.  It was more than that. After Eve made known her sexual requirements,
it was the consummation of wanton lust.  The Serpent was so astonished that
he had to avert his gaze to avoid permanently losing his sight.  Adam later
stated, "I did not have sex with that woman."  If so, it was the first but
not the last incident of unconventional sex in a First Family.  In this
case, however, virginity may actually have been at stake,

<p>
God was extremely vexed by the fundamentalist notion that he had created
Evil.  He stressed that he did not create Evil, but that it evolved from
man's basic primitive nature--proof that evolution is a fact.  He created
the world, and then, was forced to stand back and ruminate on the strange
mutability of celestial affairs when Evil appeared.  This explanation of the
origin of Evil  gives substantial support and credence to Dr. Falwel's
vocalization of the word as Evilution.  In any event  alleged theodicies are
just that--idocies.

<p>
Kansas as the scene of the filing of the suit is significant because of the
recent controversy about teaching Creationism in science
classes.  Joshua Arkisfoond, a member of the school board, when asked his
opinion, stated that Creationism needed to be taught in Public Schools
because the main line religions were doing such a bad job of it, or refused
to teach it at all.

<p>
On the matter of sex in human relationships, God stated that, if the old
doctors of the church and the writers of dogma had had access to impotence
reducing potions as are now commonly available, they would have  written a
more pleasing doctrine for the faithful.  After the Rapture, he expects the
watchword in Heaven to be:  'Just say No to abstinence.'  It will be heaven
indeed.

<p>
God was asked if he had any regrets.  He replied, "No,  none.  It was a
close call with the Anthropic Principle, however.  I defined the basic unit
of ignorance as the 'sinister.'  Had it been defined as the "jabriol,'
which is 1 million times larger, this world would not have been possible."

<p>
God says that he intends to call on members of alt.atheism to testify in his
behalf because they have contended all along that the modern day bible is
only a poorly written account of ancient superstitions that are not at all
in line with a benevolent supreme being's
comportment.

<p>
It will be interesting to see how this suit plays out.  The lawyers are
probably the only ones who will get any satisfaction out of it.

<p>
Interesting things are happening in Kansas.
