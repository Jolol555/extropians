True but the three single factors have contributed to the increase in
longevity over the last ~200 years are:

<OL>
  <li>  Public sanitation
  <li>  Health care sanitation (esp. Doctors washing their hands when
     going from one sick person to another, particularly pregnant
     women).
  <li>  Antibiotics.


</OL>
<p>
The health care "industry" as we know it has probably had little
impact on overall longevity and the care that can be bought by
a wealthy individual is only marginally greater than that available
to an average individual in light of incidences of aging-related
diseases where the exponent on the rate-of-incidence with age is large.

<p>
The "squaring" of the mortality curve is brought about by the
greater availability of (a/b/c and other less significant
factors) to the entire population.  The increase in maximum
longevity comes about due to the Poisson distribution of
maximum longevity and the increase in global population
[as the population increases, the tails of the Poisson
curve get pushed outward so we continue to have people
living to new maximum lifespans].

<p>
The Poisson distribution of maximum lifespan id due to
three things:

<OL>
  <li>  your genetic heritage
  <li>  your environmental risks
  <li>  the stochastics of your development process
     [i.e. how many heart cells you actually ended up with].

<p>
We will get a big jump when we understand how to shift our
bodies from reproduction mode into maintenance &amp; repair mode
(I just hope this doesn't require turning off testosterone :-)).
Maybe suppressing leptin production will do it.  We will get
another big jump from replaceable organs.  The harder nuts
are going to be cancer (requires good gene therapy) and
complete repair of mutated DNA (or genome replacement).
