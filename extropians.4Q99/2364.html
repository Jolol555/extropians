The idea here is as follows:


<OL>
<a name="2409qlink2">  <li>  There are extra dimensions whose radius is only a bit less
than a millimeter.</a>

<a name="2409qlink3">  <li>  The reason we don't observe atoms leaking out into the
extra space is because</a> all the matter that we can see lives
in a "3-brane", a three-dimensional extended object or
'membrane'. *This* object has full freedom of motion in all
the extra dimensions, but we are stuck in it or on it, and
only have three spatial degrees of freedom in which to move.

<p>
This much is not original to the preprint above; it's a
scenario that has been developed throughout the past year
or so.

<p>
<a name="2380qlink1">The new twist is:

<p>
3) The brane we inhabit is folded back on itself in the
extra dimensions. Electromagnetic and other 'gauge'
interactions are confined to the interior of the brane,
but gravity can travel through the 'bulk', the external
space in which the brane is embedded. The dark matter
<a name="2392qlink1">whose gravitational influence we observe in astronomy is
just ordinary matter in a neighboring fold of the brane:
less than a millimeter away through the bulk, but perhaps
trillions of light-years away through the brane!</a></a>
