Hello everyone,

<p>
Charles Platt on the cryonet wrote the following in response to a post by 
Robert Ettinger.  I found the post very interesting and thought those here 
who do not get cryonet would get a kick out of it too.  My thoughts on his 
words and especially how cryonics and transhumanistic organizations can 
appeal so much more to the public are after Charles Platt's comments.

I'm glad I returned to sample CryoNet just for the entertainment value of
this statement by Robert Ettinger:

<p>
<i>&gt;There are really far fewer unbalanced people in cryonics than you might</i><br>
<i>&gt;expect in a movement as revolutionary as ours. If you attend meetings of</i><br>
<i>&gt;any of the organizations--highly recommended--you will find, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;inevitable exceptions, that most are very solid citizens with a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;conventional range of views on most topics.</i><br>

<p>
As the saying goes: ROTFL. As a journalist I have visited many
subcultures, from Mensa to hardcore militia movements; and I have found
more socially dysfunctional, pig-headed, and sometimes downright
sociopathic misfits in cryonics than anywhere else. Of course, this is
part of their charm, and provides endless material for good anecdotes. But
there is a serious side effect. Several years ago I discovered that it was
pointless to hold meetings to recruit new members of the Alcor chapter of
New York, because some of the long-term existing members were so _odd,_
they scared off more-normal newcomers. The meetings actually served as an
anti-promotional tool and insured that in this chapter, at least, cryonics
would retain its stigma.

<p>
Quite possibly, CI is different. I haven't been to any of their meetings.
CI members could be as "normal" as a meeting of the local chapter of the
Lions or the Elks, for all I know. But based on my experience of every
other subset of cryonicists during the past ten years, I'm skeptical.

I was quite surprised by what Charles Platt said on the cryonet about the 
cryonicists he has known!  So some cryonics groups are actually worse then 
hardcore militia groups!  And even Mensa!!  lol :)

<p>
I am concerned that the enlightened and socially well-adjusted people of the 
future will decide that those in cryonic suspension are just not worth 
bringing back because they make for such bad company!!  Because I would 
think the inhabitants of the future would be fair about things they may 
brain scan every suspended person to see if they would be worth bringing 
back!  That may be reason enough for us to try to develop social graces and 
also become well-rounded human beings.

<p>
I admit I am one those guys who loves to hang out in comic book/game stores 
and spend hours looking at the wares.  I played role-playing games in 
highschool!  I recently saw an episode of the MTV animated series "Downtown" 
(about genXer's) where a guy is shown loving his visits to the local comics 
shop and a big Con but at the same time wants to "grow up" and not be seen 
as nerdy.  He meets a girl who he wants to impress and grow up for.  It was 
a good episode.

<p>
There is the saying by Groucho Marx that goes "I would never want to belong 
to a club that would have me!"  Perhaps if cryonics and transhumanistic 
organizations took this attitude and also projected an image of 
sophisticated elitism the public might clamor to join!  But of course not 
everyone would be allowed in...  I have images in my mind of a victorian era 
men's club or a modern-day country club.  We could all sit around drinking 
scotch and smoking cigars or in my case drinking sprite and using a bubble 
pipe!  Now you guys would let me in the club??  Wouldn't you?  Guys??

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
