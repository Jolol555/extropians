<a name="3264qlink1">The way I interpreted that is: in a near vacuum, it doesnt matter much
what the temperature is.  The heat transfer from or to the few particles
present is very low compared to the heat transfer by radiation.</a>  If one
were in deep space with a pressure of 1 picotorr, the temperature

You would still radiate heat away.  Doug Jones explained it in his

post.

steel.  One can put ones bare hand in the shower of sparks and yet
feel no discomfort, even tho the sparks are hotter'n hell.  Its because
there is so little mass there to conduct heat into ones skin.  spike
