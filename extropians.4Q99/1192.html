Zeb, flaky is as flaky does.  It is not limited to religions. The Soviet and 
Maoist Communist movement killed millions this century. The religious, had 
perhaps 100,000 years head start on them.  The notion that the commies were 
somehow believers in a "faith movement" of marxism -leninism, does not 
dispell the fact that they were hostile to religions of al flavors.
