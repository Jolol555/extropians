I can understand your frustration, Hal, but here's my read on it.

<p>
They had nothing good to report, and they were in no hurry to report it.
OR
<br>
They had good news, and were consequently _way_ too busy trying to get 
maximum dope on a possibly-ailing probe before it went dark again.

<p>
I take the former as very much the more likely, at the moment.

media we've become adapted to.
<br>
The Web, as the new media, doesn't play by the rules of the old mass media.
I don't *want* puffery or lies, and I'll take the responsibility of channel 
activity analysis (when I remember to).
