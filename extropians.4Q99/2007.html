HALLOWEEN PROTEST AGAINST 'FRANKENSCIENCE':

<p>
This has not been a good year for life-scientists. Anti-GM activists dressed
as genetically engineered monsters took part in Halloween celebrations in
New York and Washington D.C. to protest against what they call
'Frankenscience'.
<p>
    The Campaign for Responsible Transplantation were out in force on the
streets of New York's Greenwich Village during the famous night-time
Halloween Parade. They had created a four metre tall puppet of a mad
scientist who wore a dollar sign tie clip and clutched a model of a
pig-human hybrid. A number of 'hybrid attendants' wearing pig snouts danced
around with signs warning of the dangers of xenotransplantation. The
director of the campaign said that Halloween costumes seemed appropriate
because 'it's a very ghoulish technology'. In Washington D.C., Friends of
the Earth marched to a local branch of Safeways, wearing Frankenstein masks
and accompanied by a 'Gene Beast' who the campaigners hope will bring
attention to the genetically modified strawberries that contain a gene for
an antifreeze protein taken from the arctic flounder.

contend with neo-Luddite alarmist reactionaries.
