<a name="3687qlink1">As far as I can tell, the main nexus is by way of the notion of "eugenics" 
and the image of the "Aryan Master Race".  I discuss this a little in the 
dialogue I participated in that's published in the most recent edition of 
"the Assembler" (and which we're trying to get up onto the Extropy Online 
</a>site).  The connection is, of course, completely bogus, but it happens often 
enough that it has to be addressed and understood.
