<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Lost 25 lbs in about 6 weeks [255-230 lbs@ 6'1" 55 age] following</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Adkins diet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Any of you nutrition science wizards out there have any warnings I</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be considering?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2600.html#2657qlink2">&gt;&gt;The Atkins diet is an extremely low carb diet which throws your body into</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a state called ketosis.  Here is a comment by Curt Adams from April 1998:</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2600.html#2657qlink3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This actually does work.  When you eat virtually no carbohydrates</a><br>
<i>&gt; your citric acid cycle fails and your body switches to an alternate</i><br>
<i>&gt; fat oxidation system.  Your body has to ship large quantities of fats</i><br>
<i>&gt; in ketones around in the blood.  Since your kidney lack the ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt; retain these, they get lost in the urine.  The situation resembles that</i><br>
<i>&gt; of somebody with advanced diabetes, although this kind of ketosis won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; kill you directly.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="2661qlink2">James Sez:  According to Dr. Adkins, ketosis is the normal way the
body utilizes fat when during hard times.  Where is the data that
ketosis is dangerous?</a>

<p>
<a href="2600.html#2657qlink4">&gt; You can lose weight like crazy on this plan.  You will also be physically</a><br>
<i>&gt; weak, often nauseous, and you will smell like nail polish remover.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2661qlink3">James Sez:  I have been in ketosis for over a month now.  Never nauseous.
I do smell different in both mouth and sweat....mate thinks</a> it is different,
but
<br>
<a name="2661qlink4">not worse.  I lift weights for exercise and note that the number of reps</a> I
can
<br>
<a name="2661qlink5">do at various weight levels has declined a little.  I would think this</a> is
because
<br>
<a name="2661qlink6">I have less reserve energy stored in the muscles eventhough</a> I take creatine.
<a name="2661qlink7">The max weight I can lift has not declined.</a>  However, I feel much more
<a name="2702qlink1"><a name="2661qlink8">energetic now that the hi-sugar /  low sugar cycle is eliminated-Adkins
quotes studies that show all the body's tissues including the brain and
major organs like the heart can utilize ketones as easily as
glucose for energy, contrary to knee jerk opinion in the Establishment.</a>  In
fact,
</a>
<br>
<a name="2702qlink2">some studies showed that some tissues prefer ketones!</a>

<p>
<a name="2704qlink3"><a href="2600.html#2657qlink5">&gt; If you go on the diet and then off it, you will gain back all you lost.</a></a><br>
<a name="2704qlink5"><i>&gt; If you stay on it, you'll subject your body indefinitely to a metabolic</i><br>
<i>&gt; regime it's manifestly not adapted</a> for.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2661qlink9">James Sez:  Dr. Adkins recommends a moderate low carbohydrate diet
after your target weight is obtained.  One would be in ketosis only part of
the time
</a>
<br>
on the long term diet.<a name="2661qlink10">   Adkins thinks you cannot be healthly unless in
<a name="2706qlink1">ketosis at least part of the time.   Only in ketosis can body clean-out
excess cholesterol, etc. from arteries!  If you have all the energy you
need from a carbs all the time, the body cannot deal with whatever
fat is left in the diet to deposit God Knows Where!??</a>  No fat mobilization
</a>
in "GLUCOSIS" according to Adkins...a dangerous situation???

<p>
<a name="2661qlink11">James Sez Further:  Where is the data proving the body is not adapted
for ketosis?  Didn't humans probably evolve with the ability to store
and then use fat?  I would think that in many climates, folks would
eat lots of carbs during the summer, get fat, and then live partially
off stored fat during the "hard winter" months.  I would suspect that
primitives living in a "hard climate" purposely got fat whenever possible.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Research on the long-term</i><br>
<a href="2600.html#2657qlink6">&gt;&gt; safety of ketotic diets is zilch, which I consider inexcusable given</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; than Dr. Atkins has been pushing this diet for 25 years.  Not even a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; rodent study!  Dr. Atkins' diet may be a good thing, but he is a quack.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="2661qlink13">James Sez:  Is this Dr. Adkin's fault or the fault of Establishment science
that rejects the diet without any evidence?</a>  Quack?  That is a pretty
<a name="2661qlink14">extreme statement.  Are rodents evolved to eat meat?  Studies</a> are
expensive.

<p>
<a href="2600.html#2657qlink7">&gt;How was your experience on the diet?</a><br>
<i>&gt;Did you get very hungry?</i><br>

<p>
James Sez:  The first few days of the diet I was hungry as per usual for
candy
<br>
or pastries at various times during the day.  Previous to the diet, I would
give-in
<br>
quite often.  During the first week of the diet, I simply substituted an
Arby's roast
<br>
beef sandwich or Wendy's triple burger throwing away buns...totally
satisfying.
<br>
Absolutely easy NOT to cheat via this strategem.  After a bit, I seldom or
ever felt the munchies desire. According to Adkins this is because my body
was no
<br>
longer going through the low sugar [tired/depress] /
hi-sugar[energetic/elated] / insulin overshoot / low sugar [tired/depressed]
cycle.

<p>
<i>&gt;How about</i><br>
<a href="2600.html#2657qlink8">&gt;your overall levels of health and well-being?</a><br>

<p>
James Sez:  My overall health and well being is great.  I do continue
to take the extreme supplement regime that I have taken for
many years.    You name it, I take it.

<p>
I plan to lose another 10-20 lbs before I worry
about stabilizing.
