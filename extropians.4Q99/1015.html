Yes, but this is hard to avoid unless we start to allow others to
intervene strongly in childrens' upbringing regardless of parental
disagreement, a very dangerous road. The nice thing about a more
flexible and pluralistic system with different review boards is that
it can not just promote excellence in various directions, but that it
is quite reasonable to evaluate the success of people graded high (and
low) by the different boards. How well do people make it in life after
being graded highly by the Kansas Creationist Review Board? If it
becomes known that this is not a very good career choice (even if the
Board itself has impeccable merits as judged by all the other
theological boards) it acts as an disincentive. This way I hope we
would see the emergence of a "knowledge culture", a general awareness
of good and bad choices that would affect people's upbringing.
