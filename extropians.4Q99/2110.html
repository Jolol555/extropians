To which Robin Hanson replied,

Having mentioned some reasons why the "hard nanotech" might take longer
than one might like to reach fruition, I find the prospects for getting
viable communities of people into space *soon* to be as problematic as
ever. Although I argued earlier that space development could get a good
start with just "partial" nanotech, I must admit that big time space
access and relocation, with survival basically independent of Earth,
might well have to wait for the "real deal", i.e. the "hackable"
factory, or "matter compiler" or classic nanoassembler, (or whatever
else you may want to call it, call it a "Grail", maybe, like in that
Phil Farmer novel, _To Your Scattered Bodies Go_).

<p>
The way it looks, we had just better take all reasonable environmental
concerns seriously, because what we have here on Earth really is the
only game around, at least until we can build molecules all the way up
to the point where we have programmable factories and the
Nano-Singularity as a consequence. If it's any consolation for us outer
space dreamers, isn't this at least a bit reassuring, in the sense that
we've got a ways to go, for instance, before any possible radical
military effects of these "hacktories"? Presumably, the "hard" nanotech
capabilities, with power densities needed for handheld laser weapons and
suchlike, are not likely to burst upon us for at least another 25 years
or so, anyway.

<p>
<a name="2115qlink1">Finally, now that I've mentioned security related matters, are there any
<a name="2176qlink1"><a name="2146qlink1">really bright ideas for lessening possible dangers of nanotech,</a> short of
running far, far away,</a> that is? Someone is going to tell me that AI's
will take over and take care of it all, I'm sure, but I'm really more
interested in whether organizations of relatively ordinary humans could
somehow deal with this competently?
