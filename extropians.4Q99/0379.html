<a href="0375.html#0379qlink1">&gt; The trouble with preventing teachers from allocating the credentials</a><br>
<i>&gt; themselves is that it makes it impossible for the teacher to grade based</i><br>
<i>&gt; on performance in class.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0383qlink1"><i>&gt; "Who cares," you might ask, "so long as the student passes the test(s)?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; The trouble with THIS attitude is that it promotes cramming, as students</i><br>
<i>&gt; do no work during the year, cram to pass the test, and then forget the</i><br>
<i>&gt; material.  Providing incentives to work throughout the year is a valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of the educational process.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There's still room for a private credential organization, but ideally it'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; be one that gave tests once a month, or ideally bi-weekly, on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; progression of material, up until the final.  However, once you're talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; about bi-weekly standardized exams, the administrative costs may begin to</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase rapidly.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0385qlink1">I don't buy that argument at all: first, nothing prevents teachers from
doing any kind of testing or evaluation they want at any time.</a>  The fact
<a name="0385qlink2">that such tests "don't count" should make them more honest evaluations
because the student feels no economic pressure to cheat on them.</a>  Having
the credentialing authority be separate prevents even the teacher from
knowing exactly what will be tested, and therefore /discourages/ cramming
because it would be useless.   It also discourages teachers with "pet"
theories that they stress and test for at the expense of the broader
field of study itself.  Teachers themselves are not evaluated at all in
this model--they just acquire reputation based on how well their classes
perform with the credentialing authorities.

<p>
<a name="0385qlink3">The credentialing authority's reputation and the value of their service
will depend on how useful their evaluations are, so they have incentive
to do a good job of testing real understanding of the subject.  As for
whether or not a student has "worked" during the year, well "who cares"
is precisely the correct response here.  Fuck effort, results matter.</a>
