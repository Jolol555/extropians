Everyone does this.  The sociopath is better capable of it because (s)he is 
more intellegent usualy.  Aren't sociopaths usualy more intellegent than the 
average person?</a>

I still see the sociopath as a normal person because everyone does this.  
You do try to please your friends, right?  Why?  Because your manipulating 
them to feel good makes you feel good.  I'm not saying everyone tries to 
please their friends but the same scenario works for everyone.

<p>

<p>
Only for violent (physical or mental) sociopaths with dissociative and/or 
identity disorders.

<a href="0907.html#0921qlink4">&gt;Alternatively, for your violent sociopaths - the "psychopaths" - the </a><br>
<i>&gt;violence is the only situation in which they feel safe to be visable.  They </i><br>

<p>
All people have to have control.  I rarely feel stressed because I know what 
causes stress.  Stress is caused by stimulation in an uncontrolled 
environment.  I make it a habit to be in control of everything I do.  When 
working in a supposedly high stress environment I'm always calm because I 
know I choose to come to work, I can survive without working and there are 
plenty of other companies, I don't care what happens if I don't get a report 
in on time or complete some other task in a timely manner for there are 
plenty of other things to do.  This, I don't care attitude allows me to 
function when others can't and I perform better than everyone else.
