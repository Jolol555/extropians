<a href="0743.html#0749qlink2">&gt; &gt; &gt;Stupid is as union does....</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sorry Mike we don't agree on this one. The vast</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; scientists in this country are Union, and even the</i><br>
<i>&gt; doctors are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; organizing now.... Every right you have in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; workplace was won</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for all workers by the effort of Union labor.</i><br>
 
<p>
[...]

<p>
<a href="0743.html#0749qlink3">&gt; Unions once were an effective means of collective</a><br>
<i>&gt; bargaining, and may</i><br>
<i>&gt; still play a part in some professions, however any</i><br>
<i>&gt; profession that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; based on knowledge and intelligence has no rational</i><br>
<i>&gt; need, IMNSHO, for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; union unless there evolves some sort of monopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt; buyer of professional</i><br>
<i>&gt; labor. Unions were needed when there were only three</i><br>
<i>&gt; steel companies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; one oil company, three car companies, etc, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone who worked in</i><br>
<i>&gt; those industries was dependent on those companies</i><br>
<i>&gt; for their living. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; these conditions are not met, then it is the union</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; manipulate and extort the market.</i><br>

<p>
But what if the *companies* collude (or compete)to
reduce conditions? Then there will be no real
alternatives; people would be forced to accept lower
conditions. After all, if a company can reduce its
overhead by reducing conditions, others might try to
follow suit. In such a case labour needs
representation, as much as any other interest group
(including employers) does.

<p>
<i>&gt; The ABA, the AMA, </i><br>
<i>&gt; the NEA and others</i><br>
<a href="0743.html#0749qlink4">&gt; are IMHO manipulative, extortionary unions that</a><br>
<i>&gt; should have anti-trust</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions taken against THEM.</i><br>

<p>
Ok, but a right to representation is still important.

<p>
[...]
 
<p>
<a href="0743.html#0749qlink5">&gt; Stockholders will thus maintain pressure on</a><br>
<i>&gt; management to prevent</i><br>
<i>&gt; excessive union concessions.  </i><br>

<p>
But for the same reasons, they are likely to do it to
conditions for *non-unionised* labour..
<br>
So what do employees do then?
