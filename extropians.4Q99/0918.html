I agree that we need working ABM systems in the near future, and the more
people that have them the better off we will all be.  There are simply too
many countries with nuclear weapons these days - it is only a matter of time
before someone actually uses them, and once that psychological barrier is
broken the world will become a very dangerous place.

<p>
However, don't make the mistake of thinking that missile defenses solve
everything.  They can buy us several decades (CRNS, of course), but no more.
After that the scale of the destruction caused by advanced weapons will
approach the scale of the planet we live on, and it will no longer be
feasible to build defenses between different parts of the world.
