 The following contains much information about the "tofu study"
 reported: <a href="http://starbulletin.com/1999/11/19/news/story4.html">http://starbulletin.com/1999/11/19/news/story4.html</a> 
 <a href="http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/1999/Nov/20/localnews3.html">http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/1999/Nov/20/localnews3.html</a> 

<p>
 I contacted Lon White, lead researcher in the tofu study 
 to ask some questions. I asked him about the statistical 
 significance of the findings in the study. He informed 
 me that there were four major endpoints in the study:


<OL>
  <li>  cognitive impairment of men (number of men=3734)
  <li>  cognitive impairment of sample of wives (n=502)
  <li>  brain atrophy by weight of men who died (n=290)
  <li>  brain atrophy by volume measured via MRI (n=574)


</OL>
<p>
 The probability (p) value was less than .05 (significant) 
 for a correlation between each endpoint and tofu intake 
 (there was no significant correlation for other foods).
 In some cases the p value is less than .001 (if the p 
 value is more than .05, it's not significant, if it's 
 .05 or less, it's significant). Here's what this means:

<pre>
 IF  p = .05  there's 95% chance the correlation is true
 IF  p = .01  there's 99% chance the correlation is true
 IF  p = .001 there's 99.9% chance the correlation is true

</pre>
<p>
 So the correlation between the four endpoints listed above
 and tofu consumption had an over 95% probably of being true,
 with a probability of truth as high as 99.9%. Of course this
 cannot be read as proof that tofu causes those problems, but 
 at the least it signals the need for further investigation.
 What is perhaps most significant is that Dr White informed
 me that there is a dose-dependent relationship between 
 tofu consumption and the endpoints, ie, the more tofu was 
 eaten, the more impairment and/or atrophy is found. The 
 odds that such findings would be chance are extremely low!

 Here's a brief review of those two papers found in a letter 
 to the FDA from Daniel Sheehan, PhD, Director of the Estrogen 
 Base Program Division of Genetic and Reproductive Toxicology, 
 and Daniel Doerge, PhD, Division of Biochemical Toxicology:

Finally, initial data from a robust (7,000 men) long-term 
(30+ years) prospective epidemiological study in Hawaii showed 
that Alzheimer's disease prevalence in Hawaiian men was similar 
to European-ancestry Americans and to Japanese (White, et al, 
1996a).  In contrast, vascular dementia prevalence is similar 
in Hawaii and Japan and both are higher than in Europeanancestry
 Americans. This suggests that common ancestry or 
environmental factors in Japan and Hawaii are responsible for 
the higher prevalence of vascular dementia in these locations.  
Subsequently, this same group showed a significant dose-dependent 
risk (up to 2.4 fold) for development of vascular dementia and 
brain atrophy from consumption of tofu, a soy product rich in 
isoflavones (White, et al, 1996b).  This finding is consistent 
with the environmental causation suggested from the earlier 
analysis, and provides evidence that soy (tofu) phytoestrogens 
causes vascular dementia.    Given that estrogens are important 
for maintenance of brain function in women; that the male brain 
contains aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to 
estradiol; and that isoflavones inhibit this enzymatic activity 
(Irvine, 1998), there is a mechanistic basis for the human findings.

 The following is the abstract to the recent study, which 
 should be published by April. Below that is a memorandum 
 sent out by Doctor White after the newspaper publications:

ABSTRACT TO UPCOMING PUBLICATION OF TOFU STUDY

<br>
Association of high midlife tofu consumption with accelerated  
brain aging .   Lon White,  MD, MPH   (From the Pacific Health 
Research Institute, Honolulu, HI.)  

<p>
This investigation utilized the resources of the Honolulu 
Heart Program, a longitudinal study of Japanese-American men 
established in 1965 for research on heart disease and stroke.   
Questions regarding frequency of consumption of tofu and 26 
other foods were asked at interviews in 1965-67 and again 
in 1971-74.  Cognitive testing was done (n=3734) and cases 
of dementia identified (n=225) at the 1991-93 examination, 
when participants were aged 71-93 years.  Atrophy was assessed 
by neuroimaging (n=574) or autopsy (n=290).  Cognitive test 
data were also analyzed for wives of a sample of study 
participants (n=502) who had been living with the participants 
when their dietary interviews were done.  Poor cognitive test 
performance in late life was associated with higher midlife 
tofu consumption.  An independent association of similar 
magnitude and direction was apparent among wives of cohort 
members, using the husband's answers as proxy for the wife's 
consumption.  Midlife tofu consumption was independently 
associated with low brain weight and with ventricular 
enlargement.  Independent associations of more frequent 
midlife tofu consumption with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's 
disease and with poor cognitive functioning among non-demented 
subjects were demonstrated.  Associations generally followed 
a dose-response pattern, were statistically significant after 
controlling for all relevant and potentially confounding 
factors, and remained apparent after stratifying for age or 
obesity.  These data suggest that regular consumption of tofu 
over many years in middle life may have an adverse influence 
on brain aging manifest as accelerated atrophy, cognitive 
decline, and a lowering of the threshold for the clinical 
manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.  We speculate that 
these may reflect chronic sub-optimal neuronal plasticity 
caused by isoflavone inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity 
and/or by interference with estrogen-related mechanisms.

MEMORANDUM

RE: Responding to questions about tofu


<p>
The articles that recently appeared in the Star Bulletin 
and the Advertiser have caused a great deal of distress 
locally, and have elicited a number or requests for 
information.  While we cannot give advice and no definitive 
statements are possible at this time, the following can be said:  


<OL>
  <li>  We observed a consistent pattern of association between 
answers given by men interviewed in 1965 and in 1971 
regarding the number of servings of tofu consumed per week - 
and their scores on a test of cognitive function when examined 
1991-93.  Higher frequencies of tofu consumption were 
associated with poorer test scores.  This observation remained 
strong after controlling for all relevant factors (such as age, 
education, occupation, etc.) and no other foods or drink showed 
such an association.

  <li> 	Separately, we observed an association of high midlife 
tofu intake with low brain weight determined at autopsy, 
again after controlling for all other relevant factors.  

  <li> 	Separately, we observed an association of high midlife 
tofu intake with enlarged ventricles identified by MRI.

  <li> 	Although we did not find an association of high midlife 
tofu intake with the brain lesions that characterize Alzheimer's 
disease in our autopsy study, we did find high midlife tofu 
intake to be a risk factor for the clinical diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease.  


</OL>
<p>
Taken together, we interpret these as suggesting that consumption 
of tofu over many years during middle life is linked to a mild 
to moderate acceleration in brain aging, perhaps similar to 
that which might occur in a woman who did not receive hormone 
replacement therapy after menopause.  We cannot be sure that 
the causal factor was really the tofu, but no other alternative 
is apparent at this time.    

<p>
We believe that the most reasonable mechanism would be an 
interference with the normal mechanisms in the brain that 
maintain the connections between neurons during aging (i.e., 
brain plasticity mechanisms), caused by the isoflavone 
phytoestrogens that are known to be present in pharmacologically 
significant concentrations in most soy foods.  

<p>
Although the findings are very consistent, it is never proper 
to draw definitive conclusions from a single study.  It would 
be premature to advise anyone that they should change their 
diets based on a single research study.  In addition, there 
is evidence that consumption of soy foods may have beneficial 
effects related to improving blood lipid levels, and reducing 
risks for breast cancer.  

<p>
Unfortunately it is likely that independent confirmation or 
refutation of our findings will require 1-3 years.  In the 
meantime no definitive statements can be made.  Individuals 
will have to weigh the evidence and make their own decisions 
concerning their consumption of soy foods and their isoflavone 
derivatives.
