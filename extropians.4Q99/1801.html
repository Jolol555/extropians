I believe it.  Some yahoo at the rocket ranch put out a gag memo
saying that if anyone posted baby announcements with the traditional
weight and length, it was required to be in kg and cm.

<p>
If a "rocket scientist" loses a mission due to *units* screwup [fer
cryin out loud!] then he deserves to be the butt of cruel jokes until he
resigns in utter disgrace.  Unexcusable!  I cant think of a softer way to
state that opinion.  Had it been me, I would have been gone *that day*
begging for a job pumping gas, never again to attempt reviving
my ruined career.  spike
