<i>&gt;    &gt;Surely it is least appropriate to judge people on this list by</i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;the criteria Joe is applying to Mike. Is Robin any more</i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;insightful than Eliezer because he's Dr. Robin? Do you know</i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;what degrees, if any, Anders or Hal or Kathryn have? Who</i><br>
<i>&gt;    &gt;cares?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Who cares?" ? I'll bet Dr. Robin cares about the degrees that Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Robin holds. (And me too. I know something about his long and</i><br>
<i>&gt;hard-earned effort.) I would guess that the other list members that</i><br>
<i>&gt;hold degrees would care similarly about the hard struggle and effort</i><br>
<i>&gt;in gaining their degrees.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If a person is really passionate about the work that they do, then</i><br>
<i>&gt;holding degrees in ones' field has a special meaning. Those degrees</i><br>
<i>&gt;are not medals that they think that they can hang around their neck,</i><br>
<i>&gt;nor are the degrees a guaranteed admittance to the job world</i><br>
<i>&gt;(certainly not in astronomy). Those degrees are symbols to</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves that they were committed to learning and gaining an</i><br>
<i>&gt;expertise in a particular area. In some fields, it's not necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have a degree to gain an expertise, in other fields (like</i><br>
<i>&gt;science) it is (usually) necessary.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think that the main issue here is whether a person loves their</i><br>
<i>&gt;work. If a person truly loves their work, and are committed to it, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;shows in every aspect of their life. Degrees, papers, products,</i><br>
<i>&gt;talks, paintings, music compositions, etc. are natural by-products of</i><br>
<i>&gt;this passion. How many people really love their work? How many people</i><br>
<i>&gt;jump out of bed in the morning and say, "Oh boy, another day that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can do my job!" I would guess that not a significant proportion of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the population feel that way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pursuing one's dream(s) is what life is all about (my personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;opinion).</i><br>

<a name="0328qlink1">To hold a degree doesn't mean you are passionate of what you do.</a>  I'm very 
passionate with research of my own in the field of philosophy concerning 
consciousness yet I don't hold a degree.  I'm also not working very hard to 
get one because I honestly don't care about it.  I'm in school for the 
support of the professors and peers.  In class I don't jump through the 
hoops I'm expected too.  I really don't give a shit if I pass the courses or 
not.  If I do great. If not, so what.  It is too uncommon to notice a person 
for their ideas.  To listen to a person on bases of a degree is a Fallacy of 
Authority and doesn't give me the view of a very intelligent person.
