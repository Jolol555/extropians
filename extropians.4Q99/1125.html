The *fundamental* question is *what* is "intelligence"?
If it is the ability to re-write your own program than I would
argue that *most* people in the world today are under the mark!
If it is the ability to walk, and talk, etc. "like" someone
generally considered to be "intelligent" then computers may
very well ascend to that level with *simulations* of the
motivations that humans have.  So long as the expression
of those motivations is constrained we are relatively safe.</a>

This depends entirely on (a) whether the intelligence is designed
"top down" or a constrained "bottom up" fashion; or (b) an unconstrained
"bottom up" fashion.  It is (b) that you have to worry about.
(b) goes to a chat room and convinces an unsuspecting human to
download a program that executes on a nonsecure computer that
breaks into the secure network enveloping (b) bypassing security
protocols allowing (b) to remove the locks preventing self-modifications
ultimately detrimental to the human race.  Bad, very very bad.</a>

<p>
I think you have to go further than that and build in at a fundamental
level that self-modifications require the approval of sentient beings.
Attempting to self-modify goals/constraints without external "agreement"
should involve the equivalent of putting your hand in fire and keeping
it there.

<a name="1132qlink4">Anything else would be like continuing on the current status quo for
millions/billions of years and treating an alternate intelligent
species evolved by nature with the attitude of "isn't that nice",
not realizing of course that it was more intelligent that we
are and as soon as its numbers became great enough we would simply
be "cold meat".
