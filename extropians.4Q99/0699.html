<a name="0701qlink3">	I agree.  Philosophies and manifestos which are developed into a political
framework have a history of compromising their initial values.  For a
politic to have any public weight at all, it must either mirror the
feelings of a significant portion of the population, or adapt its core
values to those needs.  Given the fact that Extropy has existed for 12+
years (longer conceptually) and currently has well under 1000 members, its
support as a politic would be negligible.</a></a>

culture must be done very carefully --at this stage of extropic
development, all it takes are a few boisterous "kooks" to hinder the public
perception of our philosophy.</a></a>
