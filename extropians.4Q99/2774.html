<p>
&lt;&lt; My point, though, is that these desires/motivations were not created by <br>
the conscious entity with "free will" or something.&gt;&gt;

<p>
I agree that we did not consciously create our original base 
desires/motivations. 

<p>
&lt;&lt;There was no time in my life at which I DECIDED my sexuality, or DECIDED my 
food preferences, or my particular loves&amp;hates in any area. I discovered 
them.&gt;&gt;

<p>
Perhaps it was only discovery, or perhaps you did have a role in choosing all 
these things.  I suspect it is some of both (though with the examples you 
cite I would tend to agree that they are likely more programmed than chosen).

<p>
<a href="2739.html#2774qlink1">&lt;&lt; All base rules, and therefore motivations are out of our control. The only </a><br>
"freedom" our "intelligence"gets is to come up with the plans that fulfil 
this predetermined motivation set.&gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="2818qlink3">I don't think this is strictly true.</a>  Those predetermined motivations are a 
starting point.  With our conscious minds we can evaluate them, weigh them 
against one another, and recombine them into new desires.  It is like a 
sculptor with marble, who chips away what he determines to be excess to 
reveal the image desired.  Or maybe it is more like an engineer on the shore 
of a mighty river; she did not create the river, and it will take a lot of 
intelligence and effort to affect its currents, but she could still divert 
its course or damn its flow.  We may not have chosen the cards we were dealt, 
but we do have a say in which to keep and which to discard.

<p>
<a href="2739.html#2774qlink2">&lt;&lt; I could go further and mention that we don't control our intelligence</a><br>
either - in fact, that the consciousness is not a control device at all, but
that's another subject. &gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="2818qlink6">Please do continue; I would be interested to hear what you believe</a> is 
consciousness.
