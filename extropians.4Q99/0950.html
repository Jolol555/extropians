Drives generally run on different feedback loops so in most cases
I would say they are independent.  I would say that thirst is
distinct from hunger is distinct from sex.  That's because the
"detectors" for when you are in short supply of one should
involve different biochemical mechanisms.</a>

I doubt there could be a situation of a mature male "NEVER having
had" a sex drive.  Almost everything critical for survival and
reproduction Nature has built in with "multiple" redundant pathways.
You could get some diminishment of the drive (say mutations that
cause low testosterone levels), if the backup systems are
significantly weaker than the primary system.  It is clear that
with a fair amount of mental programming the sex drive can be
suppressed or sublimated into other areas (witness monks,
priests, etc.).  It is questionable whether this is mentally
healthy in the average individual.  In a "fully aware" individual
who realizes that this is occuring it could probably be "accomodated".

<p>
If someone feels they don't have a sex drive and wants to change that
then the first place to start is to determine if they have normal
levels of the motivator/effector hormones.  This should be done
by a qualified physician.
