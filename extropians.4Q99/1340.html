<p>
Actualy this can be tested, and I have tested it before.  And no the results 
do not have to be exactly 50% tails and 50% heads.  There is a distinct 
difference between statistics and probability.  Probability says what is 
more "likely" to happen.  Statistics is what happens in an a pure logic 
world.  Statistics is a tool in probability like a straight line is a tool 
in geometry.  If I flip a coin x number of times, x being equal to or less 
than 10 then I won't get fifty percent of each.  I may get something like 
70% 30%.  But If I increase x to less than or equal to 100 flips the 
percentage difference decreases.  I may get something like 75% 25% or 80% 
20%.  If I increase x to 1000 flips I get, yet a smaller difference in 
percentage, something like 90% 10%.  The larger x is, the smaller the 
difference.  The point when the number of x is important depends on how 
accurate you want your information.  Try It.
