<p>
I think you will run into the same problem with diagnostics in a uploaded
system.  The difference is, of course, that the uploaded brain can be more
easily manipulated.  Even so, right now, it would be easier to do as I said
previously then work through getting accurate uploads.

<p>
In this vein, uplifting can be pretty low tech, though it mgiht take so long
that uploading (and other) technology will surpass it in a few decades.
Remember how canola oil was made edible...

<p>
The problem is coming up with all those technologies.  I choose the octopus
because it already is fairly intelligent, breeds in large numbers (lots of
variation to notice and work with), is very different from humans (don't
want to reinvent us:), has a short life cycle (allowing one to see results
faster), and might be easier to hide from would be regulators/prohibitors.
(I bet once an uplifting gets under way, there will be people out to stop,
some of them using deadly force to destroy the uplifters and the uplifted.)

<p>
Though I'd love to see new technologies like that take hold and be used in
such a process, I think, for now, we should focus on what we have.  Pretend,
if you will, that this is a business and we have to deliver a product -- and
the product isn't a science fiction novel!:) -- in a certain time frame.  We
can take the approach of acting as if we will have all kinds of neat tech
and base our plans and forecasts on that.  Most likely, we'd be out of
business before we went public.  Or we can try to, as a certain person I
know says, "build a tugboat that floats not a battleship that sinks.":)

<p>
<a href="2993.html#3002qlink3">&gt; If you upload before uplifting the whole thing gets much easier.</a><br>

<p>
Again, I'm not debating the long run ease, just saying that if you want to
uplift something, we can start now.  We don't have to wait for nanobots and
other future tech.

<p>
Cheers!
