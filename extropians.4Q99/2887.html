<p>
Ok, I am appropriately "chastised".   I have no reason to "cure" anyone
of anything other than something that I might "catch".  (In contrast
to say a TB carrier, whom I would have an incentive to "cure".)

<p>
I agree that I may have done some inappropriate "grouping".  While
humans as a whole are "hypersexual" (quoting my professor on human
sexuality, based on the fact that humans will have sex when there
is no biological reason to do so), there may be no reason to assume
that gay people as a group are hypersexual.  In fact the logical
assumption would be that among gay individuals, there is a normal
distribution of hyper-, normo- and hypo- sexual individuals.
In a fundamentally scientific analysis, the question is whether
there is a difference in hyper/normo/hypo-sexuality ratios
in homosexual and heterosexual populations.

<p>
However, to be completely realistic about it, because homosexual
individuals cannot conceive, they have removed one of the disincentives
for sexual activity among those heterosexual individuals for whom
fear of conception/pregnancy, when unwilling to parent a child,
is a concern.  In that respect they are free to exercise the
general "human" hypersexuality in cases where heterosexuals may
choose to be less active.

<a name="2919qlink1">I would maintain, that engaging in sexual activities for non-</a>procreational
purposes is *unnatural* (i.e. it is not in the direct interest of your
genes), unless you are getting paid for it in some way (this may
include social contacts, indirect economic benefits, general well being
from the "rewards" of physical pleasure, etc.).  I.e., I believe that the
"natural" function of sex is to promote the reproduction of your genes.
I assume your genes are selfish.  If you are behaving in ways that do not
foster their reproduction, you are doing something which is "unnatural"
(because if continued to its natural conclusion would mean the elimination
of those genes).  What is "natural" is something that is going to
copy genes.  While I will allow that individuals can choose to
make a choice to fullfill the happiness directives they (and not
their genes) have, I cannot allow that non-procreative sex will make
your "genes" happy.

<p>
Because we become "gods", the whole "god" discussion is irrelevant.

<p>
All that said (perhaps getting myself into more hot water than I
started out in), let me state *clearly* that I have absolutely
nothing against individuals with a homosexual orientation.
Since I'm a diversity fan and because homosexuals increase diversity,
I'm a supporter of those orientations.

<p>
I put being homosexual in the same class as my going bald.
A consequence of genetic factors in potential combination
with environmental factors which we may or may not want to
change in ourselves when methods for doing so become available.
My going bald may have an impact on the potential for making
copies of my genes, just as being a homosexual may.  Neither
of those characteristics has *anything* to do with moral rights
or wrongs.

<p>
Fundamentally I was trying to provide an explanation for how
homosexual orientations might be maintained in a population
when they do not foster reproductive success.  Unless you
argue that all cases of homosexuality orientation are "random"
(environmental?), you have to make a case for (a) hypersexuality;
(b) misdirected attraction; or (c) something else that I
haven't thought or read about.

<p>
I'm willing to entertain other ideas.
