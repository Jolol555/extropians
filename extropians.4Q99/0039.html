I feel like I'm reading one of those clever AI programs that can put
words together well in sets of three or so, but make little sense
beyond that.  Ross's words are familiar, but he's not talking the
language of economics I know.

<p>
Intel and Microsoft a duopoly, even when their products aren't at
all substitutes?  Microsoft doesn't have price-setting power, but has
made strong barriers to entry?  Raising profits a lot wouldn't be
good for the companies "operationally"?  Companies once merged
can never be unmerged?

into thinking a mannequin was real.  I'll smile and acknowledge
the art of the construction, and be on my way to the next exhibit.
