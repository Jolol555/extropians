&lt;&lt; Dear Glen,
 
<p>
 You are very close to a major personal breakthrough.  Now push that line 
where
<br>
 you stop and everything else begins.  Be everything, cherish everything.  
Let the
<br>
 human/transhuman distinction become a difference that does not make a 
difference.

Thanks for your response.  Indeed I believe the differences between 
human/transhuman should blend together.  Life as continuum.  And believe me, 
I cherish it all.

<p>
Perhaps I'm closer than you know, I just come to it from a different 
perspective than most I've met.  Every so often I have felt my sense of 
identity expand both temporally and spacially, encompassing at first my 
family, my community, my past and future selves, my ancestors and 
descendants, stretching further yet to encompass the earth, the galaxy, even 
the universe.  Unlike, say for example buddhists, I never lose my sense of 
self, but it is grows to such a degree as to result in much the same thing.

<p>
Those are when I am feeling the connections in all things, but there are 
differences as well.  The whole has parts, and my consciousness is mostly 
confined to a small part.  One and many, I embrace both sides of the coin, 
for both views have their uses.  But before all else, I AM.

<p>
Glen Finney
