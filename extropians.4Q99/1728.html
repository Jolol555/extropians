Well, last time I checked L&amp;F were supposed to be "magical" creatures
and that would probably violate some basic perspectives I would like
to stick with.  Now if it turned out the were nanotechnology based
creatures, then your suggestion would certainly have some merit.  :-)

<p>

<a href="1710.html#1728qlink2">&gt; Or, even better, why not go straight to the top.  Set up a web page</a><br>

<p>
Oh, but there are fundamental problems with this.  If "God" tunneled
into this universe during the big bang, he may not have established
a coherent pattern capable of a reponse yet.  If "God" is running
us as an experiment, a response would presumably violate the protocols
and void the results.  If "God" is the supercomputer running our
reality, then he would simply be ROTFL.  If s/he has a really sadistic
side, then s/he will probably broadcast the man page documentation for our
reality "debugger" over the internet but add an addemdum that we *all*
have to *believe* before the terminal appears on which debugger commands
can be entered.

<p>
So, Hal you have to "believe", then I can do:

<p>
DBG&gt; Access Virtual Simulation Hal Finney
OK
<br>
Virtual Simulation Hal Finney Now Suspended
DBG&gt; Append &amp; Integrate Alien Abduction Experience #47
OK
<br>
DBG&gt; Append &amp; Integrate Headless St. John the Baptist Appearence &amp; Lecture #3
OK
<br>
DBG&gt; Resume Virtual Simulation Hal Finney
WARNING: He isn't going to be happy when resumed.
CONFIRM? *Confirm*

<p>
System reports Virtual Simulation Hal Finney to be experiencing
a greater than normal amount of cognitive dissonance.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1710.html#1728qlink3">&gt; Be sure to include helpful mailto: links and phone numbers as was done</a><br>
<i>&gt; for ET.  Wouldn't want the Lord to have to have to hunt through the phone</i><br>
<i>&gt; book.</i><br>

<p>
The God(s) appreciate your kindness, I am sure.
