And thank you! I think you are right, BIGV is very much a collective
work even if I did most of the writing and rendering. The trickiest
thing when being creative is to not only "jump out of the system" of
previous thimking, but to do it in a different fashion than the way
one usually does. Having a gang of creative people constantly coming
up with their own ideas, testing them against mine and each other,
makes it much easier to come up with things one would never have come
up with before. I don't think I would ever have thought about AI
currencies without you.

<p>
Just to get this a bit more on-topic, I think this also relates to why
scenario planning works so well. Having a number of people telling a
story about the future enables the creation of a complex and
believable future.

<p>
Gun Pride Day is the first day in week 39 every Atlantean year, so you
will have to wait 11 weeks and two days (if my calculations are right)
to show off your new replica AI Kalashnikov. As for the paradigm, it
will change when Henrik gets enough experience points to go up a level
:-)
