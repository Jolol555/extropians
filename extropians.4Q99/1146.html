<a name="1168qlink2">One of my criticisms aimed at this particular thread, is that atheistic 
bashing of religion, invariably,  is Christianity-for better or worse.</a> Why is 
<a name="1168qlink3">this? Basically because most if the posts to this thread have, at least,</a> been 
<a name="1168qlink4">brought up in a nominal Christian environment. I would include</a> the off-spring 
<a name="1168qlink5">of people whose parents utterly rejected religious faith three decades</a> ago as 
<a name="1168qlink6">"organized deceit".  Was there not a Christmas tree or Yule Log in your 
houses? Didn't Granny take you to Church in your sunday finest, maybe when 
you were four.

<a name="1295qlink1"><a name="1166qlink1">My critiques of atheistic criticisms is that its mono-cultural.<a name="1201qlink1"> How many of 
</a>
you have steeped yourselves in Hindu or Buddhism, before your reject it? I 
don't mean, merely read books about it, but spoken with people who</a> know their 
<a name="1168qlink7">faith?  How many know what the belief systems of one billion Muslims are, 
beyond media snippets?  Judeo-Christian is largely an academic word, since 
</a>
their are no Judeo's. The Jew's  belief differ markedly form what</a> is normally 
<a name="1168qlink8">taught. How about Confucianism or Taoism (hat-tip to Fritjof Capra). 
Zoroastrianism, New Age, and so much more.</a></a> 

<p>
<a name="1295qlink2">Maybe its all an adaptive, evolutionary neurosis, but at least</a> know what you 
are rejecting-not just vanilla.  And, the point of my dig, don't be so  
focused on "Euro-culture" (aha!) with its views on God and humanity, that you 
come to believe its everything, or everything significant-its not.  As to the 
morons in Kansas, thats Fundamentalist Protestant Christianity, and there are 
many Mainline Christians, Muslims, Deists, Jews, and Hindu's, and 
non-conformists who love the theory of evolution.  

<p>
Hapless, hypothesis: Even in the deep future, our happy ascendants 
(descendants) will have a 'belief system' that transcends the current 
cavalcade.
