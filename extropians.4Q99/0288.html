 (as a whole), only then can we be sure. We've only got 
 "circumstantial evidence" so far.&gt;&gt;

<p>
     Agreed.  It was just nice to have some practical experience thrown into 
the mix.
 
<p>
<a href="0184.html#0288qlink2">&lt;&lt; Actually, tasers and stun guns are quite effective against even</a><br>
 relatively heavily clothed targets (check out the Airtaser FAQ on 
 their web page, <a href="http://www.airtaser.com">http://www.airtaser.com</a>, for example), so this 
 shouldn't be a problem with UV tasers either.&gt;&gt;

<p>
     This may be a case where we need to do some testing to verify whether 
certain types of dress may be a problem or not. 
  
<p>
 &lt;&lt;Perhaps, but let's not write the idea&gt;&gt; of UV lasers &lt;&lt;off before some 
actual testing.&gt;&gt;

<p>
     Again agreed.  I really think I was off when I wrote this post, 
sheesh&lt;g&gt;.
 
<p>
<a href="0184.html#0288qlink3">&lt;&lt; Foams are basically just too slow, messy, wind-sensitive and </a><br>
 potentially dagerous (if you hit someone full in the face he could
 easily suffocate) to be of much use for nonlethal self-defense.
 Also the gun would probably be too big and heavy to carry 
 around (you need a lot of foam, and hence a heavy highpressure
  canister).&gt;&gt;

<p>
     Everyone pretty much in agreement that foam weapons aren't a good choice?
 
<p>
&lt;&lt;Sonic weapons on the other hand might have more potential:

 <a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/~freetht/us_news_070797_the_pentagon.htm">http://www.azstarnet.com/~freetht/us_news_070797_the_pentagon.htm</a>
 There's some info about other nonlethal (military) projects too, like
 the Pulse Wave Myotron, "flu guns" &amp; electromagnetic weapons]
 
<p>
 "So-called acoustic or sonic weapons, like the ones in the 
 aforementioned lab, can vibrate the insides of humans to 
 stun them, nauseate them, or even "liquefy their bowels 
 and reduce them to quivering diarrheic messes," according 
 to a Pentagon briefing. Prototypes of such weapons were 
 recently considered for tryout when U.S. troops intervened 
 in Somalia. [...] Scientists are also trying to make a sonic 
 cannon that throws a shock wave with enough force to 
 knock down a man".&gt;&gt;

<p>
    Sonic weapons might be a good way to go if they can get good 
directionality without having to have something huge as a weapon.  If the 
problem of fine-tuning the intensity to quickly get the desired result 
without going overboard and causing damage can be solved as well, this may be 
an interesting possibility.
