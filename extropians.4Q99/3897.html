I'm very curious on how would the opinion and outlook of a being heaps more
intelligent and capable than us would be affected by an altered consciousness
state, would it be a detrimental, positive or neutral experience? some people
alter their beliefs, and lifestyles radically after a psychedelic experience,
sometimes for the bad sometimes for the good, although most of the very smart
people that experiences with psychedelics, say that it was a very positive
change, specially because as we grow up and mature a lot of prejudices and
wrong concepts are implanted in our subconscious, some of these chemicals
might bring to our conscious mind memories that were kept in our subconscious
in order to protect us because they can be too traumatic or complex, that is
my theory on the bad trips, but I also think that if we manage to solve these
conflicts while on the altered consciousness state and bring these conclusions
to our normal consciousness it'll be a very useful experience indeed.

<p>
So I wonder what would be the conflicts of an AI if it has any, and also if an
AI would have a subconscious, I think that it could alter his code to store
some hidden information with restricted permits from his main modules, where
it could store all the information that it is still too complex or traumatic
for it for later research, It'll also be interesting to know if an AI can
evolve emotions, or how would it be affected by psychedelia being an
emotionless being.

<p>
I also wonder how would an AI would induce itself such an state? maybe by
altering it's patterns and modules so they behave in a different way, maybe by
lowering or raising the voltage of itself so it's circuits would behave in a
different way, those are my theories anybody would suggest a new one?
