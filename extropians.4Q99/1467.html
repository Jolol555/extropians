<a name="1469qlink1">Assuming that the probability is in fact uncertainty, do we not still
have a circularity in the definition?  Let's take coin flipping.
Let's pretend that we have good historical data showing close to 50%
heads / 50% tails, with no apparent correlation to any other factor.
So we hypothesize that the state sets that lead to heads or tails are
both about equal in size.  We've received the 50/50 results *up until
now* due to the flip occurring in a world state that leads to heads
half the time and tails half the time.</a>

<p>
<a name="1469qlink2">Now consider future flipping.  Just because the state sets are roughly
equal in size, why do we believe that future flips will be roughly
equally divided between those that produce heads and tails?  Because
the probability of the flipper being in any particular state from
among the state space that leads to a particular result is about 50%.
So we're back to appealing to probability.  We've moved the
probability, not explained</a> it.

<p>
Help me break this circle.
