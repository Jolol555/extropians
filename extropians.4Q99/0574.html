Good question.  I would argue that it is the separation of investment - 
which is very large in today's society - and financial reward, which is 
usually virtually non-existent, that has resulted in the virtual failure of 
any progress in the whole area of child rearing in our society.  The 
exchange of emotional rewards for financial investment, by the way, also 
goes under name of "prostitution."  Children and housewives have been pretty 
much turned into prostitutes by modern societies failure to economically 
rationalize the family.

<p>
One answer to the whole problem would be to reorganize the family along 
modern economic lines.  Families used to function as economic units, with 
the children expected to inherit the farm or business and take care of the 
aged parents, etc.  The Samoans have reportedly upgraded their family 
structure in modern times such that the children are now expected to pay a 
percentage of all earnings back to the family, for their entire lives.  This 
creates an incentive to have healthy, smart, productive children equivalent 
to that of pre-industrial times.

<p>
This in no way denies the importance of love and emotional exchange in 
child-rearing, either as motivation or reward.  But the idea that a mother, 
for example, MUST love every child, regardless of how evil and perverted 
that child has become, is absolutely insane.  Love is an emotional response 
to our highest values.  Emotional responses are automatic evaluations, not 
subject to conscious choice except through proceses such as suppression or 
repression, which involves sabotaging ones consciousness as such.  To sell 
that idea is to tell mothers that they must live a lie, destroy their own 
minds and happiness in order to meet some cultural dictate.

<p>
But if a mother loves on the basis of reality, then what does the modern 
child have to offer?  He or she is usually disconnected economically from 
the family.  Then the love becomes based on the child doing what the mother 
wants - a good slave, performer, or prostitute.  This is healthy?
