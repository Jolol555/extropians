Well, as home happens to be ten minutes' walk from the centre of
Edinburgh, well-known for going completely apeshit on Hogmanay at
the best of times, your guess is as good as mine! And luckily Scotland
is pretty short on millennialist loonies expecting the Rapture, so
the crowds should be pretty good-natured.

<p>
As my other half works in a microbrewery we'll be following the timehonoured
 Scottish tradition of getting insanely drunk -- although we'll
probably only have a couple of casks of real ale tapped.

<p>
Sort of makes the private/public dichotomy a bit blurry, doesn't it?

<p>
Of course, at five minutes past midnight my mobile will probably begin
ringing off the hook with annoyed sysadmins whose servers aren't Y2K
compliant trying to blame _my_ servers for falling over. But that's all
part of the job ... let's just say that the quality of sevice for out of
hours support calls won't be what t iusually is!
