When the assumed default position is to elevate all things biological to
'spiritual' status, showing a little contempt is the only (fast) way to show
that you have no emotional attachment to biology.  Perhaps we shouldn't use
the term 'meat' in our press releases but in the transhuman/extropian
community it serves the purpose of reinforcing our values by magnifying the
differences between (current) mainstream values and our own.

<p>
And when they discover that they were shit-containers all along...?

How about 'generic omnipotent being'?  Or perhaps the saying should be, "a
god knows what" (or more correctly, "a god would know what" but let's not
get carried away).

[I'm now splitting my posts into (a) the main argument/subject and (b) the
peripheral stuff that I for whatever reason feel the need to say.  Any posts
that are completely categorised as (b) will make their way into the trash.
In theory this should reduce the amount of crap I post.]
