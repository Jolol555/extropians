<a name="1190qlink1">After having viewed some of Natasha Vita-More's art</a> at
<a href="http://www.extropic-art.com/contents.htm">http://www.extropic-art.com/contents.htm</a>, I was reminded of something
Richard Feynman ("What do you care what other people think") said somewhat
sadly about the lack of attention paid by society to the wonders of science

<p>
<a name="1176qlink1">"Our poets do not write about it: our artists do not try to portray this<br>
remarkable thing.  I don't know why.  Is no one inspired by our present
picture of the Universe?  This value of science remains unsung by singers:
you are reduced to hearing not a song or poem, but an evening lecture about
it.  This is not yet a scientific age."
</a>

<p>
Through your art, Natasha, you are giving these wonders a vivid and
accessible interpretation.  I am sure, if he could see your work, Feynman
would be smiling now.
