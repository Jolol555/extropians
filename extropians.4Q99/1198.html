<a href="1192.html#1198qlink1">&gt;Lets look to Transhumanism 'faith' that the technology will come along and</a><br>
<i>&gt;successfully preserve their personalities through</i><br>
<i>&gt;technical augmentation and later 'mental uploading'. Really? What happens</i><br>
if
<br>
<a href="1192.html#1198qlink2">&gt;the breakthroughs come slower than expected, or that technological</a><br>

<br>
<a href="1192.html#1198qlink3">&gt;really have the answers to such eventualities? Maybe..maybe not.  And if</a><br>
not,
<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I can't speak for the Transhumanist movement. For myself, I absolutely do
not have faith that these things will happen. I hope that they will happen,
I will do what I can to contribute to their happening. I think it's fairly
likely to happen at *some point*, though I am not confident enough to give
any estimation of when. It depends on a mature nanotech, and on there even
being a mapping from frozen brain to active brain (to take cryonics as one
example).
<br>
<a name="1208qlink1">If I had "faith" that cryonics would work, I would have responded thus:
"Maybe there is no evidence that it will work, but I feel in my heart that
it will. If you would simply accept it without trying to explain it
scientifically, you would feel it too, and you would understand why I
believe this"</a>
