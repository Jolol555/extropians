<a name="3845qlink1">It is absorbed, just like the leaves absorbing the cold.  You see, the
winter is very cold, but in the spring, leaves start to come out on the
trees.  The leaves absorb cold.  Therefore, the weather begins to grow
warm.  The leaves continue to grow, and absorb more cold all throughout
the summer, but eventually they are full of cold, and then they begin to
turn colors as a result.  They eventually die and fall from the trees, so
full of cold are they.  At that time, they release into the environment all
the cold that they had soaked up all spring and summer, and this causes
the weather to turn cold again.  spike
