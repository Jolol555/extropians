&lt;&lt;  I see no reason why one should not choose
 one's own name to fit ones taste and personality traits.

people are ignoring a crucial problem here... The discussion is avoiding the 
central issue:  whether letting go of cultural heritage is based on one of 
the following.


<OL>
  <li>  "shame"  - a dislike of one's own heritage and the trappings thereof
  <li>  a desire to 'assimilate' into mainstream sulture ( in this case 
Christian/Caucasion hegemony) and remove the stigma and prjudice against 
one;s race ( in this case anti-semitism).
  <li>  An insistance on blatant individualism, shunning cultural ties for the 
simple reason that labels not define who we are, and should not.
  <li>  other factors


</OL>

I think Ayn rand was a blend of  2 and 3. The values she espoused were of 
upper middle class and rich peoplel, who - during the time period she existed 
- were 99% anti-semetic and would have shunned her. However, that in itself 
was not the total motivation, which we can deduce by her extremist views on 
indiviuality and egoist propaganda.
