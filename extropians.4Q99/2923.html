Hey Harvey, perhaps everyone has already told you this, but:

<p>
Wrong way around. Using yr key, GG is gay.

<p>
And as others have mentioned, yr bee analogy is wrong, since you neglect
the extreme consanguinity of those near-clones. But in general I agree with
yr argument, although the burden is on you (or yr case) to show that
inclusive fitness is better maximised in this way than by total obsession
with making babies.

<a name="3072qlink1">(I also think bisexuality doesn't really need an explanation, since rubbing
rude bits together is obviously fun and social and good for power trips,
etc, unless you've been socialised out of it [as I was and I gather you
weren't]. It's *dedicated* gayness that's the puzzle.)
