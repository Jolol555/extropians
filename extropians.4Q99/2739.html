<p>
<a href="2655.html#2739qlink1">&gt;I'll use the example of the celibate priest or monk.  Certainly the</a><br>
<i>&gt;"designer", put in the goal to procreate.  However with enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;training or desire, we can usurp that goal and replace it with</i><br>
<i>&gt;another, *perhaps* flying in the face of "rational" behavior</i><br>
<i>&gt;(i.e. substituting the pursuit of a belief system that has no</i><br>
<i>&gt;concrete visible results with one that has concrete visible results)</i><br>

<p>
We are not purely rational creatures, and concrete visible results are not
important - it is whether these concrete visible results kick off a
pleasurable reaction in our minds. Replacing a cushy sex, drugs and
rock&amp;roll lifestyle with one of constant self-flagellation is just an
example of one desire/motivation outweighing another. The monks will have a
sufficiently strong desire to prove their faith to their gods such that it
will outweigh the desire to have loads of sex etc. This faith proving desire
could be a fundamental motivation in itself<a name="2767qlink5"> - after all, cats leave
"offerings" to their human "gods" too, but I suspect that it has bases in
other things like fear of death, and self-glorification.</a> My point, though,
is that these desires/motivations were not created by the conscious entity
with "free will" or something. There was no time in my life at which I
DECIDED my sexuality, or DECIDED my food preferences, or my particular
<a name="2818qlink1"><a name="2774qlink1">loves&amp;hates in any area. I discovered them. All base rules, and therefore
</a>
</a>
motivations are out of our control. The only<a name="2818qlink2"> "freedom" our "intelligence"
gets is to come up with the plans that fulfil this predetermined motivation
</a>
set.<a name="2774qlink2"> I could go further and mention that we don't control our</a> intelligence
<a name="2818qlink4">either - in fact, that the consciousness is not a control device at all,</a> but
<a name="2818qlink5">that's another subject.
