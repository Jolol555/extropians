Hello Rob,

Please don't be feeling guilty.  I have felt very well treated by the 
members of this list.  You all have the right to say what you think.  I knew 
from the time I read the extropian principles that a rejection of the 
supernatural was a part of the intellectual infrastructure.

<p>
I have found some interesting views in this "religion bashing thread" when 
they have tried to see it from a more balanced sociological standpoint.  I 
took a class last year in the sociology of religion which was taught by a 
former Roman Catholic priest who still had a love for his church and yet 
could keep his perspective as he taught.

<p>
In my post I tried to share some of my own struggles with religion and life. 
  I do not feel it prudent to simply dismiss Christianity as many of you do. 
  I believe there are spiritual realities to be learned by prayer and living 
for God that seem foolish to those outside of it.  And yet I am a "doubting 
Thomas" in part too who questions.  I am drawn to cryonics because I want a 
chance at furthering my life and seeing what the future holds.  But at the 
same time I think one day we all may go through the tribulations described 
of in the Bible for the last days and be in a state of denial still until 
Christ returns in glory.


<p>
best wishes,

<p>
John Grigg
