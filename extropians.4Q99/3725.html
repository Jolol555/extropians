<p>
Given that most of you know that I am fond of Dan Dennett, and have read
my
<br>
comments about the 'q' word, you will be expecting me to declare
something
<br>
like, "a false premise implies any conclusion" or the short form I use
for my
<br>
kids, "if four were five, pigs could fly."  However, I am going to come
out,
<br>
right here on the extro list, and state that I believe in zombies, 100%.

<p>
Having made this declaration of faith, I am going to go on into new (I
think)
<br>
philosophical ground by stating that the 100% means everybody.  Yes, I
believe
<br>
that you, me, everyone else, and everything else are zombies.  The
sneaky
<br>
thing about this zombieism is that it is relative, such that, you do not
see
<br>
that you are a zombie, but you do see that creatures that are
sufficiently
<br>
simpler than you (to the point that you can simulate them) are zombies.
So it
<br>
is easy to see that a rock is a zombie, because you can simulate its
thought
<br>
process without much trouble, and see that it is not conscious.  A
bacterium
<br>
is a bit more difficult, and an ant is still quite a task, but you can
see
<br>
that they are zombies.  This goes for all the AI programs we have built
so
<br>
far.

<p>
Now when we get to people, it is just too difficult to run the
simulation at
<br>
this time to prove that they are zombies.  However, in a few years I
expect to
<br>
be able to go to my neighborhood SI and start to ask about this.  I
expect the
<br>
SI to stop me right there and tell me that it has run my life as a high
speed
<br>
simulation while I was approaching, and knows the question I am going to
ask,
<br>
and the answer is, "Yes, you are a zombie."  Of course, it will think
that it is not.

<p>
So, there it is.  I think you will find my theory of "Zombie Relativity"
to be
<br>
just as testable as any other zombie theory, and to have just as much
explanatory value.
