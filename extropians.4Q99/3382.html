<a href="3378.html#3382qlink1">&gt;As for putting men on Mars, there was a time when space advocates</a><br>
<i>&gt;fixed their hopes on a manned mission to the Moon.  They assumed</i><br>
<i>&gt;that once this goal was accomplished there would be a natural</i><br>
<i>&gt;follow-on in terms of exploration, experimental bases, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;eventual colonization.  As we know, none of this happened.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3378.html#3382qlink2">&gt;The same thing could happen with Mars, only increased to the nth</a><br>
<i>&gt;degree because of the tremendously greater expense.  Mars is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;any more interesting than the moon to the general public, not</i><br>
<i>&gt;after you've seen it for a few hours.  Dust, rocks, and sand,</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing more.  You can find the same thing in any desert, and we</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't spend trillions of dollars to send people out into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;desert.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3387qlink1">The moon program ended because of a lack of will, Nixon was gutting
it even as the final missions took place.</a>

<p>
<a name="3387qlink2">Mars is not particularly expensive, we're talking 30 billion over
10 years, the same amount we gave Mexico one afternoon a few years
back....</a>

<p>
<a name="3427qlink1"><a name="3387qlink3">There is alot more to Mars than dust, rocks, and sand!!!! Mars has
water!!! lots of water!!! Mars has a useable atmosphere etc,etc.</a> In
<a name="3387qlink4">other words we can live on Mars fairly reasonably, it is our next
home.... The moon is just a rock.....</a>

<a href="3375.html#3382qlink3">&gt;What's the point of sending canned monkeys to Mars?</a><br>

<p>
<a href="3375.html#3382qlink4">&gt;1) It prevents us from developing robust automation and in situ</a><br>
<p>
   material processing
<br>
<a href="3375.html#3382qlink5">&gt;2) It is orders of magnitude more expensive</a><br>
<i>&gt;3) It is damn dangerous for the monkeys in question</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3375.html#3382qlink6">&gt;I do not understand the whole business in question. If you</a><br>
<i>&gt;absolutely positively have to have manned missions (I don't), why</i><br>
<i>&gt;not the Moon? There is not much difference between 1/100 Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt;atmosphere pressure or hard vacuum. Hard vacuum is even better for</i><br>
<i>&gt;industrial processes. Insolation is much higher. And there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;almost certainly water up there. And in a pinch you can mount a</i><br>
<i>&gt;rescue mission. And and and...</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3453qlink6"><a name="3387qlink5">There is little if any water on the moon. Everything we need</a> for
</a>
<a name="3387qlink6">life support on the moon we will have to send there, Mars</a> can
<a name="3453qlink9"><a name="3387qlink7">sustain self developing colonies, we can make rocket propellant(
with a bit of initial help) from the atmosphere.</a></a> 

<p>
<a name="3453qlink11"><a name="3387qlink8">We need to become a space faring civilization.</a></a> 

<p>
<a name="3453qlink13"><a name="3387qlink9">I have nothing against the moon, it will make an interesting place
to have an observatory, but Mars is a place we can live.</a></a>
