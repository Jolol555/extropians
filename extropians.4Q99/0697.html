               Mars Polar Lander Mission Status
                       October 11, 1999

     Flight controllers for NASA's Mars Polar Lander mission have 
</pre>
set October 20 as the date of the next thruster firing that will 
fine-tune the spacecraft's path for its December 3 arrival.  The 
spacecraft is healthy and operating normally.

<p>
     On Saturday, October 9, the spacecraft's fault protection 
software placed the lander in a safe standby mode in response to 
an errant interaction between attitude control software and the 
commands under which the spacecraft was operating at the time.  
The flight team successfully returned the spacecraft back to 
normal operations within the day.

<p>
     Extensive analysis of spacecraft data by the flight teams at 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,  and 
Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, Colo., has confirmed that 
the lander does not have the same unit conversion error that 
contributed to the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter last month.

<p>
     The Mars Polar Lander team has spent the last several weeks 
planning the early lander mission that will use the spacecraft's 
radio transmitter to communicate directly with Earth.  The team 
is also working on a plan to use the currently orbiting Mars 
Global Surveyor spacecraft as a communications relay.  Project 
managers believe all of Polar Lander's science objectives will be 
met.

<p>
     This week, the team is in the process of testing and 
training for the early mission phase on the Martian surface.  
Engineers are also re-examining all of the simulations and tests 
used to validate the entry, descent and landing phase of the 
mission.

<p>
     Mars Polar Lander is currently 23.6 million kilometers (14.7 
million miles) from Mars, approaching the planet at a speed of 
4.6 kilometers per second (10,300 miles per hour) relative to the 
planet.
