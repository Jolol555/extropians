The closest example to a copy we have now are identical twins.  It has been
observed that these people generally get along very well with each other, and do
not tend to compete.  I once watched a televised triathlon in which two of the
women were identical twins.  One of them won the competition, while the other
finished several minutes later because she had had a flat on the bicycle part.  I
watched the look that was exchanged between the two as the second sister got to
the finish.  It was very brief, and I can only describe it as a moment of Zen.
Later, the second sister said that having her sister win, was the same as if she
had won.

I have no doubt that if I could run off several copies of myself, we would flip
coins to break the symmetry and each get going on one of the projects I currently
do not have the time to do.
