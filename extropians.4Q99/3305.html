Both solvable: increase the surface (unfoldable photosynthetic wings)
and reassign the reward system so that basking is at least as
fullfilling as an opulent meal. (If the sun doesn't shine, just plug
yourself in into the wall socket, and fix carbon dioxide from air. Or

Of course one should also get rid of the gastrointestinal system,
reengineering the tissue so that we don't need to rely on bacterial
symbiontes.

Yeah, it's silly, much better to immediately to go to dry (active
transport, no solvent) postbiological systems altogether. Something
relatively small, a swarm of redundant crab/spiderlike units, with
lots of sensors/limbs and really speedy locomotion. And/or large,
nuke-driven (a big carrier unit for the smaller systems, ranging from
mosquito to gorilla size).
