There's plenty of magic in the everyday world if you stop to think about 
the objects around you.  The ways technology has made you richer than any 
king that ever lived.  The marvels science has exposed.

<p>
As I write this, I have a magical device beside me.  With it, I can speak 
in a normal tone of voice, and talk with someone on the other side of the 
world.  In front of me, I see images of men who died before I was born.  
If I go outside, I have a carriage that can run faster than a cheetah.  
I also have another carriage, which can fly faster and higher than any bird 
ever flew.

<p>
It's even more basic and older than that.  I can go outside, and see light 
from stars that has been travelling to reach me for billions of years.
If I am cold, I can create a fire, and keep the night at bay.

<p>
Don't just marvel at nanotubules.  Think about how language and writing
enables us to build on the work of our ancestors.  How agriculture keeps our 
bellies full.  How fantastic everything you use and know truly is.
