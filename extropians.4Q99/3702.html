<i>&gt;&lt; regarding the media's use of the word "anarchist" in connection with</i><br>
<i>&gt;violence at the Seattle WTO protests &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is discouraging, though, to see such an utter disintegration of </i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  in social discourse, especially from the established media, who one </i><br>
<i>&gt;might</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  think would at least bother to check the readilly available references </i><br>
<i>&gt;on</i><br>
<i>&gt;a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  subject before launching into an extended description.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Discouraging it may be, but hardly surprising.  Reporters and editors tend </i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;use words in the way that they think the words will be understood.  Thus </i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;word "liberal" is invariably used to mean statist left-leaning politics and</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideology in the US with such universality that even scholarly writers </i><br>
<i>&gt;usually</i><br>
<i>&gt;feel they have to qualify their use of the word with the term "classical"</i><br>
<i>&gt;when they employ it in its original sense.  That term has become </i><br>
<i>&gt;effectively</i><br>
<i>&gt;lost to public discourse in its original meaning, such that many people </i><br>
<i>&gt;feel</i><br>
<i>&gt;they have to use the word "libertarian" now to express what "liberal" used </i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;mean.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With regard to the word "anarchist", for better or worse, the way it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;often</i><br>
<i>&gt;used here is very, very far outside the mainstream usage of the word.  Even</i><br>
<i>&gt;for fairly well educated people, the word connotes bomb-throwing crazies.</i><br>

<p>
What bothered me about this case was that the writer did spend quite a bit 
of column space trying to define "anarchist" - and not as synonymous with 
'bomb-throwing crazies - but ended up only giving a long series of vague 
references to the kind of political activities that anarchists engaged in or 
specific non-essential goals that anarchists advocated.  One could not 
possibly have gained the least idea what the term actually meant from that 
article, even though the writer spent quite a lot of effort trying to convey 
that information.

<a name="3709qlink1">I have occasionally - on many occasions over the decades, actually - been 
party to activities that got media coverage.  It is always an eye</a> opener to 
<a name="3709qlink2">read the coverage and see just how much stuff they typically get wrong,</a> even 
<a name="3709qlink3">when all the information is right there for the taking.</a>  Of course, one has 
to read H.L.Menken to see how bad it can get - as when Menken would make up 
stories out of whole cloth just to have something to report, in his early 
reporting days.  Or perhaps take a simple drowning of a drunk dock worker 
and turn it into a great tragedy, inventing sick mothers, kids, etc.
