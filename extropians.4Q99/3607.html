<i>&gt;and I keep stressing over the fact. This was not a hallucination, because</i><br>
if

<a href="3591.html#3607qlink3">&gt;I had been able to "take a picture" of what was in my mind's eye and look</a><br>
at

<a href="3591.html#3607qlink4">&gt;it later, I would see that this woman doesn't look a thing like my</a><br>
<i>&gt;grandmother. It was just that for some reason, my Grandmother Facial</i><br>
<i>&gt;Recognition Module was triggered.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would also have this effect with inanimate objects - that is, seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt;inanimate objects as faces. Like knots in a wood table, or a pattern in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;leaves on a tree. The most bizarre case was when I looked up at a building</i><br>
<i>&gt;and saw that one of the bricks was a different color from the rest of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bricks, and thought that the brick must be Bram Stoker (I don't even know</i><br>
<i>&gt;what Bram Stoker looks like - he's the guy who wrote Dracula).</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's well known that the neural pathways for recognizing objects are</i><br>
<i>&gt;different from those used in recognizing faces. This is illustrated by</i><br>
<i>&gt;various disorders in which a person can recognize common household objects,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but cannot recognize his father's face, or the opposite disorder where he</i><br>
<i>&gt;can recognize faces but not objects. I suggest a line of research to</i><br>
<i>&gt;discover if the receptor which THC binds to is responsible for mediation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;facial recognition, and possibly usage of THC for treatment of facial</i><br>
<i>&gt;aphasia (I don't know if that's the proper term for it). It's been</i><br>
<i>&gt;discovered recently that there are THC receptors in the eyes (which is why</i><br>
<i>&gt;marijuana helps glaucoma patients), I'd bet that the receptors go all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;way down the facial visual system.</i><br>
