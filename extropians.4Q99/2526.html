<a name="2620qlink1">Unfortunately, Bertie Russell subscribed as much to the musings of philosophy as
to the principles of science. --J. R.

<p>
"Science is nothing but developed perception, integrated intent, common sense<br>
rounded out and minutely articulated."
<br>
</a>--George Santayana

<p>
"Science is facts; just as houses are made of stones, so is science made of<br>
facts; but a pile of stones is not a house and a collection of facts is not
necessarily sicence."
<br>
--Henri Poincaré

<p>
"As long as men are free to ask what they must -- free to say what they think --<br>
free to think what they will -- freedom can never be lost and science can never
regress."
<br>
--J. Robert Oppenheimer

<p>
"If I have been able to see farther than others, it was because I stood on the<br>
shoulders of giants."
<br>
--Sir Isaac Newton (born on December 25, 1642)

<p>
"The age of innocent faith in sicence and technology may be over... every major<br>
advance in the technological competence of man has enforced revolutionary
changes in the economic and political structure of society."
--Barry Commoner

<p>
"We have to live today by what truth we can get today and be ready tomorrow to<br>
call it falsehood."
<br>
--William James

<p>
"In formal logic, a contradiction is the signal of defeat: but in the evolution<br>
of real knowledge it marks the first step in progress toward a victory."
--Alfred North Whitehead
