<a href="0617.html#0623qlink3">&gt;  What's honest about it? You either treat people as objects</a><br>

<i>&gt;  even sure choice comes into to a large degree.</i><br>

<p>
    and the debate sinks into the dank, dark, and necassary swamp of 
redefinition. whats an object, as opposed to a person, and what does it mean 
to treat people as objects as opposed to, well, people? is the difference in 
the attribution of significance; in the attribution of some kind of 
subjective/intrinsic value (im using that term way too much) to something 
outside oneself?
<p>
    if so, i would call it intellectually honest to deem such attribution 
irrational. if you disagree, im sure youll elaborate. ;)

<p>
    fascinating. what other methods are there to find out if theres anything 
truly different going on here, short of, say, an mri peek at the corpus 
callosum? i seem to remember something about mri peeks at corpus callosums 
being relevent to this discussion, but i dont remember how, exactly. im 
tired. but im not autistic...

<p>
<a href="0617.html#0623qlink5">&gt;  Its a logical falicy to believe that acting in one's own</a><br>
<i>&gt;  interests also implies that you must treat other's as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  objects to be manipulated.</i><br>

<p>
    interisting. i thought of them as equivalent... but i suppose we could 
mean different things by "treating people as objects". shit, im not getting 
this. since when are people not objects? i mean, perceptions are things, and 
things are objects, and people are perceptions... the resulting venn diagram 
would show that at least some people are objects... im rambling. goodnight.
