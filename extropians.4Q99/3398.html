&lt;&lt; That thought had actually occurred to me.  But if you forget the names -

<a href="3249.html#3398qlink1"> "capitalism" and "socialism" have changed in meaning between our time</a><br>
 and theirs - and look at the power groups favored, the contrast still
 holds.  Transhumanists may be "capitalists", but it's not the kind of
 capitalism that's comfortable for the captains of industry.  It's the
 modern, individualistic, Silicon Valley capitalism where old companies
 are always dying, and new ones taking over; where the "labor" not only
 isn't controlled, it gets stock options.  The Nazi industrialists would
 have hated it.

Too right about labor not being "controlled" and getting stock options.  The 
line between capital, management, and labor needs to break down, in my 
opinion.  We all need to be venture capitalist entrepenuers working together 
to our joint enrichment.  It's that "all" part that I think would have 
especially irked the nazis.
