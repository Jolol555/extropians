A cave man?<a name="1582qlink1">  Modern humans are brain boggled by the changes that
have come in our lifetimes.  In fact, I see this as a limiting factor to
technology.  People are unwilling to change faster than a certain pace.
Alex Bokov's concept of local maxima will become very important
soon, as we see evidence of just such things all around us.</a>  Talk to
<a name="1582qlink2">people, see how very many people reject the idea of extending life
out to just 500 years for instance.  You might be amazed at how many
will state that they *do not want* to live that long, even if they could
do so with good health!</a>

<p>
Your notion of having passed thru a singularity of sorts has occurred
to me as well.  Not in the Yudkowskian sense of singularity, but if
viewed from a distance we are in the midst of a sudden and violent
explosion. spike
