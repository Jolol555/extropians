Hello everyone,

It is?  I disagree heartily though I think terrain has alot to do with it.  
Like they say in the Pentagon, "we do deserts, not jungles!"  American 
mechanized might cannot be matched where we are allowed by terrain to deploy 
it.  The ancient Egyptian pharoahs might agree considering their 
charioteers.

<a name="1653qlink1">What I did like about the cold war and all the nuclear tipped ICBM's aimed 
at major cities was that the leaders of the nations involved knew they would 
be targets also!  Even if they escaped to a bunker their world would never

be the same and so they thought twice about things.  It is much easier to to 
send off hundreds of thousands of young men to die and be maimed when you 
yourself as a leader will never be in harms way.


<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
