Hello,

<p>
I apologize to Lee Daniel Crocker and Joe Dees for attributing the quote to 
the wrong person.  I will be more careful in the future.

Daniel Lee Crocker and not Joe Dees wrote:

In 50 years, we'll both probably be alive and old, but reasonably
healthy.  I have $100 in 1999 US currency that says on October 15,
2049, US currency will still be in common use, most humans will
be born the old fashioned way, live on Earth, and be speaking
English or Hindi with their neighbors, and going to work to earn
more of that US currency to spend on the wonderful high-tech gadgets
that 50 years of slow, steady progress has created.  (Fortunately,
I can't lose this bet because if I'm wrong, I won't be around topay off:).

<p>
My mistake.


<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
