<i>&gt; Well, Jeff, "artificial' or "simulated" intelligence as a program of computer</i><br>

<i>&gt; and in this manner, it is hoped, "bootstrap" themselves to produce novel,</i><br>
<i>&gt; emergent capabilities. This project is often confounded with cybernetics</i><br>
<i>&gt; and robotics research, where the objective is to develop control and</i><br>
<i>&gt; automotive manipulative systems capable of behaving "intelligently" when</i><br>
<i>&gt; confronted with external tasks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Much of what remains is fantasy, dreams that have existed for a long time</i><br>

<a name="3858qlink2">I wrote this response to your original inquiry on 12 Dec l999 knowing that a
long visionary thread was bound to follow.  Has it answered your question?</a>
Although the origin of this theme is found in the dark recesses of medieval
speculations on the homunculus, it was revived by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly,
1797-1851 whose father, William Godwin, more-or-less popularized the idea of
"The Perfectibility of Man" in his writings -- the phrase "Godwin Perfectibility
Man" was widely used satirically at the time.  All this may be studied at the
URL provided below; I'll just include a bit from Mary's work...

<p>
He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and he
concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall
never forget: The ancient teachers of this science, promised impossibilities and
performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that
metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these
philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to
pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They
penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hidingplaces.
 They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can
command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the
invisible world with its own shadows.

<p>
Such were the professor's words -- let me say such the words of the fate --
announced to destroy me. One by one the various keys were touched which
formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon
my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much
has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein -- more, far more, will I
achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way,
explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of
creation.

<p>
I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I saw how the
worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and
analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life
to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light
broke in upon me -- I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which
it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had
directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be
reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.

<p>
Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. Some miracle might
have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.
After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in
discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself
capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter."
