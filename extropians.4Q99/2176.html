Here's a bothersome point that I was reminded of on reading Greg Egan's
novel _Diaspora_ (though I'm sure it's been a nano-concern all along),
namely the danger of a deliberate, exponential, military buildup. In the
<a name="2178qlink1">_Diaspora_ novel, the transhuman societies somehow maintain what they
think of as a wisely nonexponential or nonexpansive security
arrangement, where they leave enormous tracts of natural resources
completely untouched.</a> This despite the fact that they could very readily
get<a name="2178qlink2"> into colonial competition for settling those resources</a> -- or for
<a name="2178qlink3">using them to build an overwhelming force of arms.</a> No fighting over the
resources of asteroid Ceres for them,<a name="2178qlink4"> their Coalition has voting Ceres a
mineral preserve, or something,</a> and that is that!

<p>
<a name="2185qlink1"><a name="2178qlink5">In reality, it isn't at all obvious how to nonviolently settle
sovereignty claims over newly accessed resources,</a> or what sort of
beaurocracy one should trust with administering any nature preserves, or
Neutral Zones.<a name="2178qlink6"> Also, if there are sovereign states that you don't trust,
how do you know what kind of offense they may be developing under cover,
on their own turf?</a> For instance, I don't know, myself, that recent
<a name="2178qlink7">bombings of Iraq have done anything effective to control hidden
bioweapons, so what if we were dealing with a nanofactory driven arms
<a name="2178qlink8">race instead?</a> Seemingly, if two sides get into an exponential arms race,
this is a recipe not only for fighting over space resources, but also
</a>
for converting the Earth's surface into a shell of nanoweapons. Or, have
<a name="2178qlink9">I missed something here, something about "exponential rate of capital
increase" that I don't understand?</a>
</a>

<p>
Seems like I'm having a logical pessimism attack, here, or something.
First, space settlements seem problematic, at least in the "pre-matter
compiler era".<a name="2178qlink10"> Now, it's far from apparent how to avoid getting swamped
in a fast buildup of weapons, even if you try to class some weapons as
"defensive" in character!</a> Basically, we need the Coalition of Polises to
come around and just<a name="2178qlink11"> bomb the heck out of anyone who violates the
Neutral Zone conventions -- say, maybe it's not that hard a problem, if
the Powers That Be are tough enough?</a>
