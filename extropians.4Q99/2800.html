<p>
<a href="2797.html#2800qlink1">&gt; You're starting to lead into the real issue. I can draw you a diagram of an</a><br>
<i>&gt; earth and a sun, with the earth revolving around the sun, explain how the</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth rotates, draw a little stick figure guy on the surface of the earth,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and explain, in a way which would be comprehensible given a little insight,</i><br>
<i>&gt; how although the earth revolves around the sun, it seems the other way</i><br>
<i>&gt; around since the earth is rotating. Nobody can currently give a similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; description of consciousness.</i><br>

<p>
Reductive:  Sure I can.  You're only saying that because you insist on
there being something spooky, something non-verifiable about
consciousness.  If I argue that none of the relevant spooky stuff exists,
and define my terms entirely materialistically, then I can give you a
verifiable physical description of the reasons you do the things you do; I
can even explain why you believe that there are qualia.

<p>
Eliminative:  The Reductivist could TRY to provide you with an explanation
like that, but really, there's no reason to use words like "qualia,"
"consciousness," "belief," etc.  [Well, MAYBE belief, but we should use a
different word anyway, since belief is so muddled.] Nobody can give you a
picture of consciousness because it doesn't exist; by that I mean there is
no referent to the word "consciousness."  Sure, the Reductivist could make
up a definition of consciousness, and show how THAT exists, but it's my
opinion that what you mean by "consciousness/qualia" doesn't exist, and
that the Reductivist is just confusing the issue by using your
terminology.

<p>
I would say qualia is "what it seems like", or, if qualia
<br>
<a href="2797.html#2800qlink2">&gt; only seem to exist and don't really exist, I refine my definition saying</a><br>
<i>&gt; qualia is ""what it seems like" seems like".</i><br>

<p>
I don't understand your redefinition.
