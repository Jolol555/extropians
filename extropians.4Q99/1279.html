<a name="1284qlink1"><a href="1249.html#1279qlink1">&gt;Anyway, in a recent edition of the local paper there was a report on a </a><br>
<i>&gt;particular syndrome that has been identified as genetically based.</a></i><br>

<p>
You will have to post the abstract of this research for me to believe it.  
Sounds like total bullshit to me.

<p>
<a href="1249.html#1279qlink2">&gt;Some researchers want to classify it as a form of autism, while others </a><br>
<i>&gt;object that since the sufferers do not have nearly the extreme version of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the symptoms that are typical of the autistic, it should not be lumped in.</i><br>

<p>
The problem with mental illness classifications in the psychiatric industry 
is they try to sum up a bunch of symptoms found commonly with people of 
certain personality characteristics and call it a disorder. These people 
don't have a f***ing  clue.  You can not diagnose a mental condition as if 
it were small pox.  Until people realize this, there will be very little 
advancement.

<p>
<a href="1249.html#1279qlink3">&gt;The typical behavioral symptoms are things like inability to respond</a><br>
<i>&gt;appropriately</i><br>

<p>
??!? inability ??!?  I think everyone already knows my view on this.

<p>
in social settings, misinterpreting social signals completely,

<p>
look into their childhood upbringing.  Meet their bizzare parents.

<p>
<a href="1249.html#1279qlink4">&gt;failure to abide by social norms of dress and grooming, often accompanied </a><br>
<i>&gt;by strange physical gait or tics.  They noted that many such people are </i><br>
<i>&gt;highly intelligent and productive and that a high percentage of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;afflicted are in fact considered top computer programmers - so-called </i><br>
<i>&gt;"super-programmers", who can work at blinding speed for long intense </i><br>
<i>&gt;stretches of total concentration, but are useless in social settings.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1284qlink2">Sounds like some reporter just made this up.  How many people are effected 
aparently?  And where are the records?</a>
