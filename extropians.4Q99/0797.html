<a name="0807qlink1"><a href="0788.html#0797qlink1">&gt; I also think it is a problem that child bearing, child rearing is</a><br>
<i>&gt; considered to be a low status occupation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Give a child to a mother of normal intelligence who swears up and down</i><br>
<i>&gt; that she does want a baby.  And 9 out of 10 of them will raise happy</i><br>
<i>&gt; healthy children.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But you give a child to a mother with an IQ of 80, who thinks that having</i><br>
<i>&gt; a kid is really cool.  And everyone who sees the situation will shake</i><br>
<i>&gt; their head and say 'that poor unwanted child'.</i><br>

<p>
There's a little too much intellectual snobbery there for my tastes.</a>
<a name="0807qlink2">Intelligence is a good thing, but there are personality traits I admire
more, like honesty and courage, and which are just as likely to result
in successful child rearing.</a>  As Judith Harris argues eloquently in
<a name="0807qlink3">"The Nurture Assumption", a mediocre parent is just as likely to be
successful as a talented one.  It really takes serious abuse to screw
up a kid for life.</a>  "Child care" is certainly important, but it really
<a name="0807qlink4">shouldn't be a high-status high-paid job because it doesn't need</a> to be.

<p>
<a name="0807qlink5">This suggests some different models of how to raise successful kids.</a>
<a name="0807qlink6">As much as our society might look down upon the practice of wealthy
parents dumping their kids on underpaid nannies, that model really
does make good economic sense: invest in good genes, then hire
adequate care for the kids while you're off doing something better
suited to your talents.</a>  Another model is for the IQ 80 mom: find a
<a name="0807qlink7">guy with good genes to fool around with, and invest your time (and
that of your husband if any) in caring for the child while the stud
with good genes goes on to spread them elsewhere.

<p>
I personally couldn't imagine not raising my own kids hands-on.
But maybe that's not such a waste of talent for an unambitious
philosopher who's not going to set the world on fire anyway.</a>  I
certainly can imagine having them with a less intelligent woman;
indeed there are many women I've known who weren't the sharpest
knives in the drawer but who were honest, dedicated, caring women
with whom I would have been proud to raise a child (alas, most
of them were involved with other men at the time).
