It was pointed out to me by someone else in private email that when a man
raises the issue of abortion, "it is an indication/invitation to also
openly discuss orchiectomy and vasectomy" -which I think is entirely fair
:)

<p>
In that spirit, I noticed when I had my vasectomy that they keep the
snippets of tubing, preserved in alcohol, to protect themselves against
malpractice claims in the event the patient "reconnects" and fathers a
child.  I told the staff that it reminded me of the movie "Last Emperor of
China", where the court eunuchs kept their balls in little boxes so that
they could be buried "complete".  I've noticed that women laugh harder at
this than men....
