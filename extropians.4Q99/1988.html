Glad someone brought this up, for I fear doctors are giving bad
advice under some circumstances.  When doctors see the youngest
fingers going numb, especially in office workers, especially in
the silly clone valley, the *immediately* say no keyboard for
a month.  How the hell is one to do one's job?

<a name="1997qlink1">I have had this problem over the years, and experimented with
it enough to report the following theory:

<p>
Whereas I agree this *may* be related to keyboard use in many
people, in my case, the phenomenon is much more dependent upon...</a>
motorcycles!

<p>
I was getting better, fewer instances of finger numbness, etc.  I
went on vacation in New England, drove 4 megameters in 11
days, no keyboards, suddenly, major dead fingers!  Both hands.
The weekend we had extro4, rode the bike up to Berzerkely, dead
fingers.

<p>
The first year I was doing extropians, no capital letters
to reduce keystrokes, no difference.  Wrote a 400 page fiction
work in about a month, no increase in dead fingers. Gave up
Jar Jar Binks, no difference.

<p>
<a name="1993qlink1">Conclusion:  in my case, the wrist problems are more related
to driving than keyboards.</a>  Now I will wait and see if the
medical community concludes similarly within a few years.
Its driving and motorcycles.
