 The only way to deal with this is to differentiate "Mind" from "body".
 In that area, the December Scientific American has an interesting
 discussion on scientists unraveling both the "Movie in the mind"
 and the "Observer of the Movie" that seem to make up the essence
 of the "spirit" argument.


<p>
Basically any time anyone asks me that, I say: "Well, if you belive the 
spirit is a supernatural thing, a magical thing, and not subject to the laws 
of science, than won't it be also not subject to time and space, and so it 
won't have to find a place to dwell, it'll just be there again when person is 
animated."

I figure if they believe in that stuff anyway that expanation should work. : )
