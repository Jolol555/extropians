<a name="3851qlink1"><a name="3837qlink1">well to change the topic I think that love pills already exists (MDMA and it's
analogues) unfortunately it has some side effects, and it's believed</a> that chronic
<a name="3837qlink2">use can lead to neuronal damage although no conclusive data has been show</a> of it's
<a name="3837qlink3">neurotoxicity on humans, unfortunately these kind of drugs are ilegal</a> and research
<a name="3837qlink4">is prohibited, but fortunately MDMA and analogues action is similar to some
serotonin affecting antidepressants, and I hope further research leaves</a> to safer and
<a name="3837qlink5">more effective drugs.</a>

<a name="3837qlink6">It is interesting to note that MDMA is not just the love drug it has many
interesting effects, like the reduction of agressiveness, improved outlook,</a> easiness
<a name="3837qlink7">to solve problems, improved self esteem, it's also very effective</a> for some people
<a name="3837qlink8">against addiction, if you've been paying attention these are the qualities</a> that many
<a name="3837qlink9">antidepressants have and my guess is that is because they have more</a> in common that
<a name="3837qlink10">what people thinks,</a> LSD also affects serotonin so this might explain why some users
<a name="3837qlink11">find some of these positive effects with that drug, hopefully further</a> research leads
<a name="3837qlink12">to the discovery of some really useful, powerful and safe mind</a> altering chemicals.
