*World's smallest tweezers in the BBC news. Scientists have made a pair of
tweezers capable of picking up objects just 500 nanometres (billionths of a
metre) across. The achievement is being hailed as another milestone in the
fast-developing field of nanotechnology in which researchers manipulate
matter at the scale of individual atoms and molecules. (includes 3 gifs)

Nanotube Nanotweezers is also the topic of an article in Science Dec 10,
1999 issue. (Vol. 268 No. 5447) Philip Kim and Charles M. Lieber (who also
carries another section in the issue about the topic)
Pre-article boldface: "Nanoscale electromechanical
systems--nanotweezers--based on carbon nanotubes have been developed for
manipulation and interrogation of nanostructures. Electronically conducting
and mechanically robust carbon nanotubes were attached to independent
electrodes fabricated on pulled glass micropipettes. Voltages applied to the
electrodes closed and opened the free ends of the nanotubes, and this
electromechanical response was simulated quantitatively using known
nanotweezer structure and nanotube properties. The mechanical capabilities
of the nanotweezers were demonstrated by grabbing and manipulating submicron
clusters and nanowires. The conducting nanotube arms of the tweezers were
also used for measuring the electrical properties of silicon carbide
nanoclusters and gallium arsenide nanowires."
