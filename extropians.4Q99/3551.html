Billy Brown apparently comments on <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html</a> :
<br>
<a href="3526.html#3551qlink1">&gt;I notice that your paper does not explicitly deal with the possibility of a</a><br>
<i>&gt;single entity doing more than one job at once.  This seems significant,</i><br>
<i>&gt;because I would expect that upload-level technology would make it possible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;create a wide spectrum of sentient and semi-sentient software entities.  An</i><br>
<i>&gt;upload (or an artificial AI, for that matter) might be able to handle one job</i><br>
<i>&gt;or thousands, depending on its internal architecture and hardware resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The very simplest jobs could be done entirely by non-sentient AI, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;boundary where sentience becomes necessary is likely to shift over time.</i><br>

<p>
I'm not sure capable people and uploads are of doing more than one job at once,
but even if they could I don't see how that would change the situation much.
I agree that as we get better at making AI, we will give more and more jobs
to them.  I even modeled this at <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/aigrow.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/aigrow.pdf</a> .

<p>
<i>&gt;My intuition says that an entity that upgrades its abilities agressively </i><br>
<a href="3526.html#3551qlink2">&gt;could</a><br>
<i>&gt;enjoy an increasing standard of living in such an environment, especially if</i><br>
<i>&gt;the amount of non-sentient AI is large and grows rapidly.  What do you think?</i><br>

<p>
I have no idea why your intuition is telling you this, but mine doesn't say 
that.
<br>
I'm assuming wages are given by intersecting supply and demand for labor, 
and am
<br>
postulating a very low and flat supply curve (i.e. it is fast and cheap to 
make
<br>
more computers, and the costs don't go up as you make more of them).  I think
you are focusing on the demand curve, which is irrelevant if the supply curve
is flat.

<p>
<a href="3526.html#3551qlink3">&gt;One other detail that I noticed:  Aren't you implicitly assuming that economic</a><br>
<i>&gt;growth remains constrained by our current physical limits?  If most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;economy consists of services and/or information, wouldn't it be capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt;growing on the same time scale as upload reproduction?</i><br>

<p>
However fast the economy grows, it would seem we could devote a large enough
fraction of the economy to building computer factories to keep up with the
demand for computers.  If so, then a more service oriented economy doesn't
change things.
