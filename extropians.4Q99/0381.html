&lt;blush&gt; In level of awareness, perhaps, but probably not in adeptness.  
It may depend which street on which you encounter an average representative
of humanity.  I suspect that urban dwellers have developed a strong sense
of their personal image being an artificial creation, to be altered to suit
the present
<br>
circumstance.  Surrounded by a variety of artificial environments that
they can enter and leave at will, they develop the ability to adopt the 
colorations of an environment for the time in which they would be within it.
