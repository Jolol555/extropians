I read that paper and liked it, but I think you misunderstand it.
It is not describing a sequence of species saturating one after another.

<p>
The paper was taking as a puzzle the fact that we tend to see a lot
more species than we see essential nutrients, even though a simple
model says that you shouldn't.  They note that a fluctuating
environment is enough to make room for lots more kinds of species,
each one tuned to a different frequency of fluctuation.  The
paper's contribution is to then note that if different species
approach equilibrium at different rates, that is enough to create
a fluctuating environment which can support many species.
You don't need outside fluctuations; inside ones are enough.
