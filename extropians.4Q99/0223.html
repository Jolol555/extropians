The upload world will be alien and weird in many ways.  An analogy
is how the poor went to the cities while the old-money stayed in the
country.  The city was alien, less comfortable, and less healthy,
and so the rich preferred to stay in the country.  But many poor went
where the jobs were, in the city.  So did the rich who understood that
the cities were where the future lie.

<p>
<a name="0295qlink1">I think the life of an upload will be far more alien that city life
was long ago for country bumpkins.  For perhaps a long time, there will
be no upload children, and the modeling of all the ways in which
our bodies influence our minds will be crude and wanting.  It will be
like living on the edge of insanity in many ways.</a>  But I think it is
where the future lies, nonetheless.

<p>
Another analogy is that of hunter-gathering vs. farming.  Farming
was arguably a harsher less comfortable life, but it was where the
future lie still.
