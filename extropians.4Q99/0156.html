 Yes, and it should be easier to engage multiple targets too. No
 more (single use) wires, just point and fire 'till your out of juice.
 Quick reloading shouldn't be a problem either; just slam in a fresh
 magazine-shaped battery and you're ready to go. Very neat.&gt;&gt;

<p>
Very good points, sounds almost like a weapon that could meet most of my 
criteria.  Of course, there is still the problem of whether the voltage you 
would need to guarantee imobilization would also lead to a fair number of 
fatalities.  We really need more info about this option.  Is this UV laser 
taser concept one that can actually work?
  
<p>
<a href="0142.html#0156qlink1"> &lt;&lt;That would be nasty indeed. Perhaps the good old single-heavy-</a><br>
 needle approach (used to sedate wild animals) is still the best. Or,
 as a compromize, you could fire 2-5 medium-sized projectiles
 at once.&gt;&gt;

<p>
Or maybe we just need a dart weapon that can fire three round bursts quickly. 
 We're still left with the problem of dosage.  Maybe a semiauto would do.  
Shoot the attacker, and keep shooting until down.  If the agent was fast 
enough, then you could modulate dosage by observing effect.  With good enough 
training you coud do a quick gage of how many rounds you might need to start 
with to take down the aggressor (hmm, over 200 lbs I'd say, better double tap 
him&lt;g&gt;).
