On a distantly related note, I heard several contestants at the last Van 
Cliburn competition perform a sonata, in serial style, by Carl Vine.  
Although he works hard to make it more palatable (e.g. putting the 
dissonances in such different registers you don't notice them), it's still 
pretty nasty.  Towards the end, I *distinctly* heard the tune for "na na Na 
na NAAA na" (the children's taunt).  Perhaps some of the participants in 
these modern sillinesses are in on the joke?
