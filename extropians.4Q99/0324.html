Philosophy, like mathematics, is a discription of the world as we see it.  
And like mathematics we can manipulate philosphy to look at the world in new 
ways and solve for unknowns.  A problem I've noticed among philosophers, 
professional or not, is many of them forget to keep their philosophy in 
check with reality.  A great example is a conversation a close friend of 
mine and I had about a week ago.  My friend, Shawn, argued that philosphy 
was not to be trusted because it gets trapped in its own world.  I 
disagreed, stating that it only happens to philosophers who don't keep their 
logic in check with reality.

<p>
Shawn argues, "To get to a door from where I was in the room I had to first 
get half way there.  To get half way there I had to get half that distance, 
and to get half that distance I had to travel again half that distance, and 
continue to travel half the distance to infinity.  Thus I couldn't get to 
the door because I had to travel the half distances to get there, which I 
would have to travel for ever since to get to the first half distance is 
infinity.  But because I do reach the door and the philosphy of half 
distance is logical, philosophy reaches a point of being illogical and can 
not be trusted."

<p>
I reply, "Because I do reach the door your logic is falliceous.  As you do 
travel a half distance to get to a destination, either distances cannot be 
divided to an infinate smallness (hence there is a point when a distance is 
as small as it can get) or I cannot move through an infinate space (hence a 
ruler measures 3 inches and I move 4 inches at a time).  Regardles on the 
position we continue to argue about movement or distance this logic explains 
how we can reach a door by traveling half distances without contradicting 
itself.  Because I kept my logic in check with reality I can explain 
reality."

Just about everything you read uses logic.  I recommend dissecting every 
piece of logic you recognize and test it for fallacies (errors in thinking). 
  Then you will develop a logical understanding of your own.  It will also 
bring out the critic in you.
