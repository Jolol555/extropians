 The limited instruction set they have has to be highly specific for

The good news is that if and when the machine is commercially available, it

The whole complex consists of 64 processor towers.  I wonder if a single

The good news is that if and when the machine is commercially available, it
will probably be an excellent platform for neural modeling.  The bad news is
that someone (or many someones) will still have to develop the software.  I
expect that much of IBM's $100 million will be devoted to software
