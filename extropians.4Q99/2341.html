<p>
<a name="2347qlink1">The worthiness of "playing nice" relates to how it effectively promotes any
population that practices it. From an evolutionary standpoint, populations that
play nice succeed (reproduce and thrive) more than populations that do not play
nice.</a>

<p>
Not quite, because to the degree people do eliminate biases by relying on a
scientific approach to making decisions, they succeed more than people who make
decisions based on personal biases.

<p>
Only if we allow our confidence to exceed our imagination.

<i>&gt;more in tune with reality are likely to lead to better results.</i><br>

<p>
Exactly. That explains the scientific link of moralism to biology (as per
Richard Dawkins' essays on the subject).

<p>
<a href="2326.html#2341qlink5">&gt;Those premises most useful for ethical reasoning are those about</a><br>
<i>&gt;human desires: not lofty, theoretical, ideological desires like</i><br>
<i>&gt;peace and progress, but simple ones like food and sex that we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;observe the reality of directly.  What other realistic base can</i><br>
<i>&gt;there be?</i><br>

<p>
Certainly not what we "ought" to do versus what we "can" do, because (obviously)
we don't _want_ to do everything that we _can_ do.

<p>
Science still provides the most complete answers to the questions humans pose
for themselves.

<p>
Cheers,
