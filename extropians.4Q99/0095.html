Eugene why not let this happen too quickly?  Our current system of
identifying perpetrators relies on face recognition, but done
by extremely fallible and often panicky carbon units.  I would
think we would be much better off with machines doing the
face recognition, voice recognition or perhaps body offgassing
recognition instruments.

<p>
There are undoubtedly many innocent black people who rot
away in prisons while the real perpetrators go free to victimize
others, simply because our face-recognition bioware is less
effective with those of African descent than with others.

<p>
Before you jump me or flame me, think this over.  Im proposing
a testable hypothesis.  We could surely invent software</a> that
could identify faces more accurately than can humans, which
would keep innocents out of prisons and get dangerous felons
off the streets.  That being the case, *why not* let this happen
too quickly?  Let it happen!  It cannot happen too quickly.

<a name="0101qlink1">Where Im going with this<a name="0114qlink1"> is: NO FEAR.  Popular catch phrase
<a name="0116qlink1">today.  If you are not committing crimes, then no fear.  You *want*
face rec instruments everywhere.</a>  If you *are* a violent criminal,
then yes, be afraid, be very afraid.  The future may not be your
kinda place, but for the rest of us, face rec software is your friend.
