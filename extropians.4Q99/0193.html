In Orange County, we will be soon experiencing - in Irvine, or course - what 
other areas in California have already been put through - the use of cameras 
to catch speeders or people running red lights.  On MacArthur Blvd. I 
counted seven camera locations already installed.  Of course, if political 
harrassment were the goal then the cameras could be used to track the 
victim.
<br>
<a name="0204qlink1">My chief concern, however, as a motorcycle rider is that very few</a> of the 
lights respond to my 630 pound bike.  Thus, I am forced to run red lights or 
turn signals every day, or spend excessive time waiting for a car to trigger 
the light.  A local bike shop owner was actually cited for this a few years 
ago and discovered that the law in CA actually takes this into account.  If 
the light doesn't respond, then you have the right to proceed with caution, 
under CA's "reasonable person" basic driving law.
However, she had to go to court, pay an attorney, etc. (the fine for running 
a red light is now over $250 here, not to mention insurance costs)  With the 
new automated system, I can easily imagine getting twenty or thirty 
citations in the mail suddenly, and having to spend a month off work - which 
would mean getting a new job - fighting each one.  Of course, the judge 
might rule against me, as you can't get a jury trial, and Orange County 
judges are notorious for arbitrary rulings, in which case I would probably 
have to leave the state, and become a fugitive...
