I've been meaning to send a 'hello' to Amara Graps, so 'hi'!

You bet.  The effort of doing so got the best of me two years ago. My own
advisor sat me down and asked a hard question--why are you here?  I made
<a name="0331qlink1">the decision not to reenter graduate school until I could prove to myself a
true commitment to one particular field.  At the same time, that will not
stop me from writing serious articles and books.  Those will lead in the
future to a more solid basis to acquire a graduate degree, if needed.</a>
Right now, I am lending my support to my sweetie as he goes through the
pain and sweat of acquiring a highly technical master's.

<a name="0236qlink1">Yes.  I see the concern, however, over the societal bias that individuals
who have a graduate degree are viewed as more capable, smarter, etc.  In
the upper classes of American society, an advanced degree is viewed as a
societal credential, and people do not ask 'did you get a graduate degree'
but 'what is your graduate degree</a> in'?

persons who already have the Dr.!</a>
