<i>&gt; Although written by someone with very extropian values in a magazine that </i><br>
<i>&gt; also has a very extropian editorial policy, the article portrays the </i><br>
<i>&gt; significant and GROWING opposition on both the "left" and the "right" to </i><br>
<i>&gt; almost all forms of advanced biotech in the U.S.  That opposition is already </i><br>
<i>&gt; well-rooted in Europe.  If the biotech companies don't get up off their asses </i><br>
<i>&gt; and start fighting back in the media BIG TIME, we're going to have real </i><br>
<i>&gt; trouble.</i><br>

<p>
It is an interesting article, but I felt that the author was arguing
against straw men to some extent, exaggerating the nature and scope of
the opposition.

<p>
<a name="2560qlink1"><a href="2533.html#2550qlink2">&gt; The most influential conservative bioethicist, Leon Kass of the University</a><br>
<i>&gt; of Chicago and the American Enterprise Institute, worries both that our</i><br>
<i>&gt; quest for ever-better mental and physical states is too open-ended and,</i><br>
<i>&gt; contradictorily, that it is utopian.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2555qlink1">An Altavista search for "Leon Kass" got only 327 hits.  For comparison,
"Max More" got 1229, "Robin Hanson" got 1017, "Hans Moravec" got over
1500.  Granted, the web is not the most fertile ground for a hidebound
reactionary like Kass, but still if he is the most influential person
with this view, we have little to worry about.</a></a>

The author also spent much time on the debate over using embryonic cells
for stem cell research, but it seems to me that he got it backwards.
There was a key phrase missing from the article, which is part and
parcel of the opposition to embryo research: "moment of conception".
This is the moment at which God imbues the fetus with a soul, in the mind
of many of the religious people opposed to abortion.  After this point,
abortion is murder.

<p>
There is no moment of conception in the construction of a mammallian stem
cell from an adult.  And there is no reason to expect (as the author seems
to assume) that anti-abortion politics will carry over into opposition
to the creation of human stem cells.

<p>
It is true that the opposition to abortion is a practical problem today,
by restricting research on embryonic human cells.  This is a valid point
and something to be concerned about.  But it is a great leap to conclude
that there is a significant movement that will oppose tissue engineering
for medical purposes.  In fact the author did not offer any quotes from
anyone opposing the creation of stem cells from adult human cells.
