This brings up the question of identity and consciousness.  Who am I?  Well, 
the way I currently see it is that my self is made up very roughly of two 
different but very important parts, the immediate me and my personality.  The 
immediate me is essentially the conscious me, the pattern that is held in 
short term memory and that is able to alter the self.  Then there is the 
personality which is the vast associational network that developed from the 
interaction of my genes and experiences, it holds my memories, memetic 
ecology, emotional settings, etc.  The personality is what gives me my 
identity, what primarily distinguishes me from others, but it is the 
immediate me, ephemeral and malleable, which makes me more than just 
information.  Constantly the immediate me draws on bits of the personality to 
create my self, over and over again.  Without the personality there is no 
identity, without the immediate me there is no spark.  The immediate me, 
through processing, can add to or alter the self image, which is fed back to 
the personality to be incorporated.  Much (though not all) of the personality 
may be made up of memes, but they're not in the driver's seat.  Memes in and 
of themselves are no more alive than viruses.  We are alive, we are aware, 
and what does it matter if much of who we are is constructed from memes?  
That does not change the fact that I am, and that I choose who I will be.

<p>
   So how does this ramble relate to the preceeding statement?  Well, I guess 
it does in this way; when you upload my personality into a construct capable 
of generating an immediate me based on my personality, then you have me.  
True, since much of my identity is based on memes, they will endure with me, 
but so will many other informational patterns.  The memes are building 
blocks, not the building.  Also, while I will likely be separated from my 
genotype, my mental phenotype will be translated as well, so I can't say 
we'll be leaving that genetic information completely behind (when you scan a 
photograph of a painting into a computer, you don't lose the painting, though 
you do lose the canvas and paint).

<p>
Just some thoughts this and other postings have inspired me to.
