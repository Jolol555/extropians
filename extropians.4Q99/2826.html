My apologies, I misunderstood your meaning.  I agree!  I get ruffled
<a name="2910qlink1">feathers at people who put so many qualifiers on their messages that when
you pin them down, they never expressed anything definite to even discuss!</a>

<a href="2813.html#2826qlink4">&gt; You've missed my point. I never said that the same and only the same unfit</a><br>

<p>
No problem.  I just have a hot-button when people mention homosexuality as
an evolutionary dead end.  In my mind it indicates the classic flaw in
believing that every single individual has to propagate or else it is not
furthering the evolution of the group.  This is clearly false to anyone who
has studied biology.<a name="2900qlink1">  Anything that helps the group survive improves the
breed.

<p>
<a name="2838qlink1">An example:  Drones help a beehive survive.  Just because they don't produce
does not mean that they are an evolutionary dead end.  Their evolution was
crucial in the survival of hive-based groups.  By having non-reproducing
workers do all the engineering and work, this frees up the breeders to do
nothing but breed.  Neither could survive without the other.  People who
think that the breeders are highly evolved while the drones are unevolved,
deviant evolutionary mistakes, is not recognizing the full range of
evolutionary processes.  Evolution developed the entire hive structure to
allow the propagation of each succeeding generation.</a></a>
