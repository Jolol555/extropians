Below

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  "The only sound is a choking in his throat as he continues to vomit while</i><br>

blood.

<a href="0202.html#0516qlink3">&gt;  The blood is mixed with his intestinal lining. He has sloughed off his gut.</a><br>

I don't normally have a very high opinion of Stephen King, but I think he's 
right on with his opinion of "The Hot Zone".  I snorted this book up in one 
long airplane flight and was throroughly terrified the whole time!
