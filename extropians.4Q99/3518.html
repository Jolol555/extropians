I will be hosting a party again this year, with a theme: Y2K Holdout! Since
none of my friends are foolish enough to buy into the psychosis of "the world
is going to end" that seems to be fairly popular right now we thought we could
have some fun.

<p>
My front door wiil look like the entrance to a bunker, i.e. sand bags, steel
plating, etc. The upstairs (my part of the house) will be stocked with cases
of Spam, MREs (military rations), bottled water, flashlights and of course 15
cases of toilet paper. What better to have on hand? It will be worth it's
weight in gold after the crash. All the boxes will be empty of course, I don't
need THAT much T.P.! = )

<p>
Everyone will be comming as thier favorite post-apocolyptic character from
film, television or books, or they can come prepared for the end. since I
belong to a group of prop makers and costumers we'll be wearing some very cool
costumes: Aliens 2, Star Wars, Star Trek, Mad Max, etc.

<p>
In short I plan on having one hell of a good time.... just in case. = )
Newark, CA may never be the same again.
