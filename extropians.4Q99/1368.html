Yes, but it gets cliched fast.  And these are just the posters.  I've had
the "good" fortune to see the Soviet exhibition at the Vorhees-Zimmerli Art
Museum last year (at Rutgers in NJ, USA; don't know if it's still there).
The official art was purely propaganda.  It gets old fast.

<p>
I can understand you seeing that in it, though.  And a lot of that came from
the Stalin era too -- not from the 1920s or early 1930s, which were more
socialist realist than
<br>
let's-make-Stalin-look-like-the-greatest-man-ever-and-the-people-under-him-l
ook-like-heroes-too.  The latter is more like Nazi art -- pushing the right
buttons to keep people from questioning authority.

<p>
I saw, e.g., a socialist realist film from before the war.  I don't recall
the name of it.  But it was basically the peasants overcoming the oppressors
together as a dirty, grimey mass.

<p>
And this sort of art does not really challenge people.  It just makes them
feel comfortable being what they are and following who is in charge.  On
this, see "Finding Good Art: A Challenge for Objectivists" at my web site.

That is funny!:)  Someone should put that up on the web.

Can't argue with that.
