Personally, I believe that, at least in twentieth-century American
culture, the male sex drive is more annoying and tends to get its
victims into more trouble.  But that's a side issue.

If you're proposing that male and female sex drives can be swapped, that
they're the same module programmed the same way, then you're simply
wrong.  Sociobiologists have found different reproductive strategies for
males and females in every species where the genders play different
reproductive roles, including humans.

<p>
Sounds to me like there should be three threads.
