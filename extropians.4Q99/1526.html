This is a SUPERB question, Aaron.  As you say, there are lots of reasons to 
rush to develop transhuman technologies now and folks like Robin Hanson and 
Robert Bradbury make compelling cases for being involved on the cutting edge 
(the "fuhstest with the mostest" strategy).  But I (for one) am with you in 
the desire to take the time to smell the roses along the way.  

<p>
I think there IS a way to have the best of both worlds: Friendship and trust. 
 Within a zone of personal trust, you should be able to take a break from the 
rush of advancing technologies to enjoy a few of their fruits without being 
left behind, secure in the knowledge that those who have taken their turn at 
work on developments while you were diving or flying or deep-space cruising 
will share the benefits of their work when you get back into the "trans-rat 
race".  I don't want to be a part of any world that excludes such a 
possibility.
