<p>
Is there a difference? Remember, I don't see any difference between
frontal lobe function and reasoning.

<p>

<a href="0989.html#1018qlink2">&gt; abuse, or lack of love would "damage" any part of their brain.  Instead it </a><br>

<p>
<a name="1033qlink1">"Damage" is a tricky word. Have feral children damaged brains? Certain
parts never developed well during the critical periods of development
(for example language in some cases), emotional neglect and abuse have
programmed very dysfunctional behavior programs and reactions into
their limbic systems and deprived environments have likely decreased
overall cell and synapse count. I would say they have damaged brains,
their brains are not just different, they work worse than "normal"
brains. The same goes for antisocial personality disorder, it is not
just an alternate normative system, it is a syndrome of personality
and behavior changes that usually leads to serious problems for the
person and impairs their decision making ability.</a>


<p>
<i>&gt; The fix for this </i><br>
<a href="0989.html#1018qlink3">&gt; should be simply to discuss reasons for doing or not doing anything.  Find </a><br>
<i>&gt; out where they're associating their reasoning and then feedback some </i><br>
<i>&gt; alternatives.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1021qlink1">Yes, this might help. Cognitive therapy is being tested to treat
antisocial personality disorder (usually in prisons; otherwise the
patients are rather uncooperative). I'm not sure how well it works,
the medline abstracts I looked at had rather mixed results.</a>
