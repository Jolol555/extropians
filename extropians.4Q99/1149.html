By "technical analysis" I mean foretelling the price of
stocks by means of curve fitting. At least astrology is
more colorful.

<p>
It's true that the PE ratio of stocks are quite high historically
and I can only think of two reasons to explain it.

<p>
1)The perception of risk in stocks as compared to bonds is
<p>
    less than it has been.

<p>
2)The perception of earnings growth in stocks is greater
<p>
    than it has been.

<p>
If you think these perceptions are correct then the high PE
won't bother you (much). If you think the perceptions are
not correct then despite its dismal performance over the
last 20 years you should put your money into gold not
DC area real estate. Real estate crashes usually
accompany stock market crashes. That was certainly
true in 1929, and after Japanese stocks tanked 10 years
ago the grounds of the Imperial palace in downtown Tokyo
were no longer worth more than the state of California.

PS: You could counter that it's equally absurd for amazon.com
to be worth more than the country of Norway, but I don't
have any stock in amazon.com.
