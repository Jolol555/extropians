Please excuse my butting in, Rob. The urge to cite Wilson overcame me. In
contrast to rulebook morality, other theories attempt to explain the moral
imperative with smoke and mirrors. For instance, situationist ethics derives
mostly from romanticism, I guess, and trusts in love. I find Wilson's theory
most compelling as it makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Anyway,
when people do what feels right and true, they usually succeed morally --
without even thinking about it.
