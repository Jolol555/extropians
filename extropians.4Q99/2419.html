<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Which brings up an interesting presentation/education question: when</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the newly reanimated suspendee asks "OK, what happened while I was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; away?", how do you answer it? To make a concrete example, if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; reanimate Bejamin Franklin after his successful experiment in early</i><br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cryonics, how do we explain the current situation and what led up to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it so he can understand it?<br>
</a>

<p>
<a name="2527qlink2">Ben Franklin was a very intelligent and inquisitive man who were he somehow 
brought to our present era would quickly adapt and do better then many 
people from this time do!  But remember, we are all cut from the same 
genetic cloth so to speak.  Now imagine a man raised in the 20th century who 
dies in the early 21st and is suspended.

<p>
He is then reanimated into the very late 21st century.  He may find himself 
economically competing against young people genetically engineered to have 
cognitive abilities that far outstrip him that augment that already 
impressive ability with machines designed for their minds and not his.  Even 
if he uses this cybernetic augmentation he will not be on their level when 
they use it.

<p>
Imagine how this man may feel?  Especially if he was in his previous life 
considered very bright as an educated and respected professional.
This whole situation may lower his self-esteem as he sees his prospects for 
work, leisure and mates diminished in this new world.</a>

<p>
So Ben Franklin in the 20th century being genetically "one of us" would 
adapt quickly and in time fully assimilate while a 20th/early 21st century 
person could find themselves woefully inferior in mental/physical powers as 
compared to the late 21st century person and experience culture shock that 
never wore off.

<p>
Of course, I realize some readers may say that he can be genetically 
engineered to be the equal of the societal mainstream.  But this may not be 
possible for an adult or may be too expensive.  Any thoughts?  Perhaps they 
would just have to wait until technology advanced and they could be 
"upgraded" but then they would probably always be several rungs behind on 
the ladder.
