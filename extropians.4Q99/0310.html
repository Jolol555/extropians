I suspect that a very very large majority of people are not up to this level
of awareness.  Many people are locked into the belief that they *are*
who the represent themselves to be or who they are perceived to be.
So if you insult or dislike that perception or representation, you
are insulting or disliking *them*.  It takes a significant insight
to view oneself as the canvas and not as the painting.  To view
oneself as a canvas with a painting that adapts (in a creative
fashion) to the individual(s) viewing the canvas, oh boy.  That
requires a *lot* of processing capacity and memory or experience
(from which to draw memes for themes).

<a name="0381qlink1"><a name="0373qlink1">Kathryn's comment about adapting appearance to match context pointed
out to me how aware some people are with regard to this.  My awareness
must be several levels below hers and I've been trained to be aware
of such things!  So when we talk about meta-styles with the average
person on the street we are just *light-years* apart.
