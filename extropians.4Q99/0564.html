One of the most certain signs of the impending death of a movement or 
organization or ideology is when the focus shifts from what is true and 
important re the goals and purposes of such to the need for warm bodies.  
I'm not really certain whether this is a cause or just a predictor, or 
probably some of both.  This is what really killed the libertarian movement 
- or pretty damn close.  It all became politicized and whether one got 1.3% 
of the vote in some district or a whopping 1.4% became the subject of 
endless meetings that could easilly stand in for some of the intermediate 
circles of hell.

<p>
When this happens, the better people either drop out or never drop in longer 
than to check it out and then do something less boring.

<p>
As I have not been shy to state in many different ways, percentagewise women 
are far, far, far more into every aspect of ENTROPY than men.  Most of them 
see their primary life's purpose in promoting the survival of their 
particular DNA.  Thus, the idea of reengineering DNA, uploading, etc., is 
morally abhorent in the extreme, and they are not shy to make this clear, 
either.

<p>
There are also some really dynamite EXTROPIANs out there who are female.  I 
would hope that those people would not be offended at my or any other male 
or female pointing out the blatently obvious truth about the realpolitic of 
gender in our society.  Only when we can look at the truth - or just the 
evidence - can we actually do anything about it.
