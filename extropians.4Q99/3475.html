<p>
An uploaded society might have laws that said you could never evict
a mind from a brain.  In such a society fewer loans would be made
and fewer uploads would be created.  This might hurt such a society's
economic growth relative to competitors, though perhaps not hurt it a lot.

<p>
You might ask yourself this ethical question though: is it better to
let a life be created and then have to end it, or is it better to never
have let that life exist at all?
