Hi!

<p>
I love it too (particullarly the first few series) but I don't think it's as
good as the ones I mentioned (and you could also mention "Smith &amp; Jones",
"You Called M'Lord?", and "Crazy Train" as possible options).

<p>
Are there any good US comedies nowadays? I used to watch "Seinfeld" and "The
Simpsons" but right now I don't think I watch a single US comedy. I believe
"Frasier" is the most popular comedy in the US but I think it sucks. Is
there some alternative?

That's weird. Have you ever watched "Not the 9 O'clock News" or the
third/fourth series of "The Black Adder"? They are superb.

<p>
Hasta.
