God is an issue of where we apply our faith.

<p>
A thousand years ago, and today, a mother with an ill child might pray, an
expression and practice of faith.  She would pray to God, if monotheist, or a
God, if pantheist, or perhaps to the spirits.

<p>
Today, besides that, she might make a call to 911 and the miracle of modern
medicine.  So, we see the imbuement of faith to non-spiritual means.  Maybe it
could be called Technos.

<p>
People have faith in their habits, normally regularity, and maybe their horse at
the track.  Many espouse spirituality as faith, and religion as a large, well
established part of community and avenue of spiritual expression and
commonality.

<p>
Many, probably most, still have some faith in a higher power.

<p>
It is impossible to disprove a higher power.  Strict monotheists can still
assign everything to an omniscient, omnipotent God.  It doesn't matter what ever
things are ever scientifically explained that were previously assigned to
miracle.

<p>
I don't know if he was particularly extropian, or if Westerns are particularly
extropian, but Louis L'Amour wrote a book _The Lonesome Gods_ which has some
themes of faith transitions, otherwise generally a decent story.

<p>
Infinity is a mathematical expression, as well as a slightly different
expression with spiritual aspects.  The limit of 1/d, as d goes to infinity, is
zero.

<p>
To each his or her own.
