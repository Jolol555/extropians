<p>
<a name="2517qlink1">Let me paraphrase to see if I understand you.  You seem to be saying
that creatures at one star care only about the energy and metals at
</a>that star.<a name="2517qlink2">  Thus the only interest they have in other stars is to
collect metal from those stars and bring it back home.  This interest
is temporary, because eventually they have more metal at home than you
can use, given their limited local energy.  Also, they have no interest
in the energy at other stars, because energy is too expensive to
immediately transport or to store awaiting a low cost opportunity.</a>

<p>
<a name="2517qlink3">Empirically, I think this predicts that we will not see metal planets
<a name="2415qlink1">around visible stars.  This is a prediction we should be able to
verify in the next twenty years or so.  I presume you use "metal"
in the usual astrophysical sense of everything but H and He?</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2517qlink4">It also predicts we will not find effective ways to transport or
store energy.  But how hard would it be to surround a star with a
parabolic mirror to direct starlight to a different system?  Or to
power a laser directed there?  Perhaps you want to argue that the
local demand for energy will also satiate, as well as the demand
for mass.</a>
