<a href="1151.html#1172qlink1">&gt;Real opposition to theocracy has to come from the tiny minority of truly </a><br>
<i>&gt;secular humanists.</i><br>

<p>
I would never make statements like this.  By saying only a certain group, or 
idea is the only answer, is incorrect.  There are other ideas other than 
secular humanism that would classify as "real" opposition to theocracy.

<p>
<i>&gt;Look what happened to George Bush, Sr. in 1992: He was bullied into </i><br>
<a href="1151.html#1172qlink2">&gt;expressing views with which he didn't personally agree because the </a><br>
<i>&gt;moderates were silenced by fear of their "holier" brethren.</i><br>

<p>
You will have to be more specific to what he supposedly expressed for which 
he didn't agree.  Here is a quote from George Bush 4 years prior to the date 
you're talking about.

<p>
Statement by George Bush, August 27, 1988:"...I don't know that atheists 
should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. 
This is one nation under God."

<p>
So what view was he bullied into expressing?
