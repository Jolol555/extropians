After searching the National Library of Medicine for a while
I believe I've come upon a possible physiological basis for 
the indicated tofu-induced brain atrophy cited in my first 
post (URL above). It may be related to the fact that the main 
soy phytochemical genistein reduces DNA synthesis in the brain, 
and reduced DNA synthesis is associated with apoptosis, which 
is also know as "programmed cell death." This effect might be 
why genistein appears to cause cancer-cell death. Problem is 
your brain's not a cancer, and neither are a guy's balls
(PubMed Search: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed</a>):

The effects of genistein (Gn), sodium azide (naz), and 
dexamethasone (dxm) on testicular cells TM3, TM4 and 
GC-1 spg were studied in vitro. First, a series of 
experiments were performed to assess the response of 
the cells to the exposure of Gn, naz, dxm, a combination 
of Gn with naz and Gn with dxm. Trypan blue exclusion 
assay was used to determine the percentage of viability, 
and LDH-cytotoxicity test was used to assess the degree 
of treatment-induced cytotoxicity on each cell type. A
second series of experiments were performed to study 
cytomorphology and determine the type and percentage of
treatment-induced cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) on 
each cell line, using fluorescent dye technique to detect 
apoptotic and necrotic cells, and tunnel assay to confirm 
apoptosis. The results from the data obtained demonstrated: 
i) that incubation of testis cells with each of the agents 
(Gn, dxm, naz) alone and in two combinations (Gn-dxm, and 
Gn-naz) induced significant testicular cell death; ii) that 
both genistein and dexamethasone mostly and significantly 
induced apoptotic cell death while sodium azide induced 
necrotic cell death; iii) that addition of dexamethasone 
to genistein demonstrated synergism in apoptosis on testis 
cells; and iv) that combination of naz with Gn demonstrated 
synergism in necrosis on testis cells even though Gn alone 
did not induce significant necrosis. It is concluded that 
the synergistic actions of genistein and dxm, and of genistein 
+ sodium azide in induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis may 
be of clinical and pathophysiological research interest 
considering the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential 
of genistein; and the clinico-pharmacological application of 
dexamethasone and sodium azide.

By using tissue miniunits, protein kinase modulators, and 
topoisomerase inhibitors in short-term incubation (0-90 min) 
we studied (1) the role of protein phosphorylation in the 
immediate control of DNA replication in the developing rat 
cerebral cortex and (2) the mechanism of action for genisteinmediated
 DNA synthesis inhibition. Genistein decreased the DNA
synthesis within less than 30 min. None of the other protein 
kinase inhibitors examined (herbimycin A, staurosporine, 
calphostin-C) or the protein phosphatase inhibitor sodium 
orthovanadate inhibited DNA synthesis and they did not affect 
the genistein-mediated inhibition. The selective topoisomerase 
inhibitors camptothecin and etoposide decreased the DNA synthesis 
to an extent similar to that of genistein and within less than 
30 min. In addition, the effects of these substances on 
topoisomerase I and II were studied. Etoposide and genistein 
but not herbimycin A, staurosporine, or calphostin-C strongly 
inhibited the activity of topoisomerase II. Our results (1) 
strongly suggest that the net rate of DNA replication during 
the S phase of the cell cycle is independent of protein 
phosphorylation and (2) indicate that the early inhibitory 
effect of genistein on DNA synthesis is mediated by 
topoisomerase II inhibition rather than protein tyrosine 
kinase inhibition.

Using quantitative autoradiography, both nuclear DNA 
repair - measured as nuclear unscheduled DNA synthesis 
(UDS) - and mitochondrial (mt) DNA synthesis were 
evaluated in situ for several types of cells in the 
brains of untreated mice of various age. It was found 
that distinct types of neuronal cells showed a decline 
of both UDS and mtDNA synthesis with age, whereas - 
except for glial cells of the cerebral cortex - no glial 
or endothelial cells showed age-related alterations of 
UDS. Together with various data reported in the literature, 
these patterns of a cell type-specific decrease of UDS and 
mtDNA synthesis with age in the mouse brain lead to an 
improved understanding of the complex interrelationships 
between the molecular events associated with the 
phenomenon of aging as well as to a new idea regarding 
the cause of the specific distribution pattern of those 
cells in the human brain that are affected by the formation 
of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease.

The effects of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors 
olomoucine and roscovitine on DNA synthesis were studied using 
short time incubation (30-90 minutes). Both purine analogues 
at concentrations from 1-100 microM decreased the DNA synthesis 
of rat brain cortex in a dose-dependent manner and the maximum 
effect occurred within 30 min of incubation. Staurosporine, 
another potent CDK inhibitor did not affect the DNA synthesis 
in the concentration range 1-250 nM. These results indicate 
that olomoucine and roscovitine block DNA synthesis by a 
mechanism independent of CDK inhibition. We propose that the 
cellular effects of olomuocine and roscovitine on the cell 
cycle are at least in part due to this early inhibitory 
effect on DNA synthesis.

We have previously shown (Mgbonyebi et al., Anticancer Res., 
18: 751-756, 1998) that roscovitine, an olomoucine-related
purine analogue and a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent 
kinases, inhibited the proliferative activity of human breast
epithelial cells in vitro. The purpose of the present study 
was to identify the cellular processes and targets affected 
by roscovitine treatment in the estrogen receptor-negative 
MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells. Treatment of the 
cells with 10 microg/ml roscovitine daily for a length of 
time ranging from 24 to 240 h revealed that the compound 
inhibited DNA synthesis, induced cell death, and irreversibly 
inhibited the proliferative activity of the cells. Morphological 
analysis of roscovitine-treated cells by light and fluorescence 
microscopy demonstrated that this cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitor induced cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, 
reorganization of actin microfilament architecture, and 
extensive detachment of cells from the cell culture substratum. 
These cellular events are all known to be associated with 
apoptosis. Collectively, the data generated from this study 
suggest that roscovitine induced apoptosis in the estrogen 
receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Because 
the efficacy of many anticancer drugs depends on their ability 
to induce apoptotic cell death, modulation of this parameter 
by roscovitine may provide a new chemopreventive and 
chemotherapeutic strategy for the clinical management of 
hormone-resistant breast cancers.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is required for
completion of the DNA synthesis step of DNA replication as 
well as nucleotide excision repair (NER) of damaged DNA. 
We investigated the expression of PCNA mRNA and the levels 
of PCNA protein in the adult rat hippocampus following normo- 
and hypothermic global forebrain ischemia. Hypothermia 
protected the CA1 neurons from ischemic damage. A constitutive 
expression of PCNA mRNA and protein was detected in all 
hippocampal subfields, as well as in other brain regions. 
During reperfusion, PCNA mRNA levels were up-regulated in 
the vulnerable CA1 subfield at 36 h following normothermic 
ischemia. In hypothermia, this induction appeared already 
after 18 h. Following normothermic ischemia, nuclear PCNA 
immunoreactivity was largely abolished during reperfusion 
in the vulnerable CA1 neurons, prior to cell death. In 
contrast, total PCNA protein content of this region, as 
measured by Western blotting, remained largely unchanged. 
In the CA3 region, a transient decrease in nuclear PCNA 
immunoreactivity was observed. In the dentate gyrus region, 
no down-regulation of nuclear or total PCNA protein was 
observed during reperfusion. Following hypothermic ischemia, 
the PCNA protein levels did not decrease in any of the 
hippocampal subregions. In contrast, no change in the levels 
of Ref-1, a protein involved in base excision DNA repair (BER), 
was observed following normo- or hypothermic ischemia. Our 
findings indicate an altered functional state of PCNA protein 
in the ischemia-sensitive CA1 neurons suggesting that DNA 
repair processes are affected in these post-mitotic cells 
following ischemia. Impaired DNA repair may play a role in 
the development of postischemic neuronal damage.

Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a mechanism for the 
elimination of cells that occurs not only in physiological
processes but also in drug-induced tumor cell death. Thus, 
because cisplatin, cis-diamminechloroplatinum (II), produces
important damages on the DNA inducing apoptosis in several 
cell lines it has become a widely used antitumor drug. 
However, cisplatin possesses some dose-limiting toxicities 
mainly nephrotoxicity. Pt(IV) complexes, such as iproplatin,
ormaplatin, and JM216 are a new class of platinum complexes 
that exhibits less toxicity than cisplatin. Some of these
complexes have shown significant antitumor activity and a 
low cross-resistance to cisplatin. In the present paper, we 
have analyzed the DNA binding mode and the cytotoxicity of 
a novel Pt(IV)-bis (monoglutarate) complex. The data show 
that this novel complex produces DNA interstrand cross-links 
to a higher extent and with a faster kinetics than cisplatin. 
Also the Pt(IV)-bis (monoglutarate) complex kills glioma 
cells at drug concentrations significantly lower than those 
of cisplatin. Interestingly, this Pt(IV) complex produces in 
the glioma cells characteristic features of apoptosis such 
as 'DNA laddering' and fragmented nuclei. Moreover, the p53 
protein accumulates early in glioma cells as a result of 
Pt(IV)-bis (monoglutarate) treatment. These data indicate 
that the Pt(IV)-bis (monoglutarate) complex induces apoptosis 
in glioma cells through a p53-dependent pathway.
