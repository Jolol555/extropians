<p>
Quite possibly you *are* more conscious than them.  If you accept that
consciousness is "self-awareness", then I think an argument can be made
that consciousness is just another way of describing intelligence in
action.  To me consciousness is the difference between observing a world,
and observing the world with the knowledge of the consequences of one's
interaction with the world.  Intelligence would then clearly be the
limiting factor on the amount of "consciousness" one could have.

<p>
"Awareness" describes the recognition of an information pattern of some
type.  "Self-aware" simply means that the body of information that is
"you" is part of the environment being observed.  We as humans have a very
limited awareness; it is very easy to create environments and situations
where the brain does not possess enough awareness to function adequately
(which is why we have reflexes).  A sufficiently intelligent system will
not only be able to find patterns in an environment, it will also be able
to find patterns in the way the environment interacts with its existence
and behaviors.  In the real world, it is difficult to observe an
environment without one's presence causing subtle changes to the
environment you are observing.  Of course, few AI systems actually have
the opportunity to observe the consequences of their existence.

<p>
Therefore, I would say that consciousness can be defined as the point
where a system has sufficient intelligence that it can analyze patterns in
the way it interacts with its environment.  Every AI system that I can
think of simply analyzes the environment.  I could be wrong, but I don't
know of any that are capable of analyzing the impact of their own
existence on the environment they are in.  This feedback loop seems to be
the only requirement for self-awareness that I can see.
