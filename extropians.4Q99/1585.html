  (a working analysis with what may be new angles of
  argumentation against the FDA posted for feedback)


<p>
  SHOULD WE ABOLISH THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION?

<p>
  Ideas like abolishing the FDA may sound absurd on 
  their face, but unless cases against a given system 
  are examined, supporting it is probably irrational.
  Many people accept the case for the FDA on its face,
  after all, who would want unsafe and/or bogus drugs? 
  But the claim that the FDA ensures safety and a system 
  of tort liability does not is not automatically true.

<p>
  The following are a few features of what may be valid 
  and unique points against the FDA, posted in order to 
  acquire critique and/or supplemental supporting points:

<p>
  FDA Approval provides promotion and legal protection for 
  the wealthiest members of the pharmaceutical-industrial 
  complex (PIC). The illusion is that the FDA is a watchdog 
  of PIC, and to some degree this is true, but the bottom 
  line is that (a) the FDA maximizes the profits of a few 
  manufacturers, (b) minimizes profits of or eliminates 
  smaller manufacturers and (c) steers consumers to drugs 
  that are marketed primarily because they are patentable 
  (which ensures maximum profits due to exclusive sales 
  rights) NOT primarily because they are safe and effective. 


<UL>
  <li>  The FDA causes patentable drugs to be favored over 
  non-patentable drugs, even if the non-patentables are 
  shown to be as-or-more effective and safer in any number 
  of studies conducted by research facilities not associated
  with the company that plans to sell the drug (FDA oversight
   is merely the review of testing funded by the same
  company seeking approval and the resultant profits). No
  company will fund research for FDA Approval of a nonpatentable
   drug if all other companies can also sell the
  drug without having paid for the Promotional approval.
  Patent rights and the surety of large profits derived
  therefrom, not safety and efficacy, define the structure 
  of contemporary medicine. The fact that FDA-Approval 
  protocols inherently favor patentable drugs is the 
  single largest feature promoting this harmful situation.


</UL>
<p>
  This situation causes safer and equally-or-more effective 
  non-patentable therapeutics like SAMe (which has been more 
  thoroughly tested in the sum of studies done by independent 
  research facilities than many FDA-Approved drugs) to be 
  valued and prescribed less than dangerous FDA-Approved 
  drugs like Prozac. The result is that consumers are steered 
  away from safer products that haven't been FDA Approved 
  toward far-more dangerous products that are being promoted 
  by their FDA-Approved status. This ensures that patent 
  holders make maximum profits while consumers are exposed 
  to maximum harm. The irony is that this is done in the 
  name of consumer safety and keeping businesses in line! 
  Notice that this perversity is not an attribute of FDA
  corruption, but of the FDA working according to plan.


<UL>
  <li>  FDA Approval acts as a legal shield in cases where FDA- 
  approved drugs are causing harm to some. The fact that 
  a drug is FDA Approved and has not been revoked is seen 
  by jurors in court cases against a drug manufacturer as 
  powerful evidence that the drug is not culpable in the 
  case at hand, regardless of the facts in that case. The 
  fact of this is verified when the FDA does revoke approval,
  as it did of the drug Fen-Phen, whereupon a flood of libel 
  suits followed, even though Fen-Phen was just as harmful the 
  day before and numerous studies showing its harmful nature 
  were published years before FDA revocation. The fact that 
  law suits start en mass after approval is revoked is the 
  very measure of the legal protection provided by FDA Approval.
  Lawyers know that juries will be swayed by FDA directives 
  more so than by any research or the facts in a given case.


</UL>
<p>
  There are many FDA-Approved drugs that are causing serious
  harm to individuals who should be compensated for such harm,
  but are not because judges throw out evidence and juries 
  are prejudiced simply because the drug is "FDA Approved."


<UL>
  <li>  FDA Approval and the "bullet proof" legal status it 
  provides approved drugs establish logical incentives for 
  fraud that would be expressed in the following thinking 
  on the part of a drug manufacturer: "Gee, in our studies 
  that we will submit to the FDA for approval it looks 
  like this drug may be harmful, but if we simply fudge 
  the numbers a little to get it past the FDA-review panel, 
  it will then be 'safe' and insulated from liability, and
  it will take years for the FDA to revoke it, if they
  ever do, and by then we'll have made millions anyway."
  However, in a free market they would think: "Gee, it 
  looks like this drug might not be safe, we'll probably 
  get sued if we sell it, better trash this one." In this 
  case "safe" is a matter decided by independent research 
  and in the courts per case, not by authoritarian decree. 
  This shows how FDA-Approval status provides an incentive 
  that could/should lead to unsafe and/or ineffective drugs.

  <li>  FDA Approval defines what 99% of medical practitioners 
  will prescribe  BECAUSE  FDA Approval is a legal shield.
  Doctors are more vulnerable to a lawsuit if they prescribe
  a non-FDA-Approved medicine than if they prescribe an FDA-
   medicine. If an FDA-Approved drug is prescribed 
  and it causes harm, the doctor can say "it was approved,"
  but if they prescribe a non-FDA-Approved drug that causes
  harm or fails to save the patient, they are more vulnerable
  to law suits. Doctors know this, and will therefore tend 
  to stick with the FDA program. The result once again is 
  that consumers are led towards therapeutic options that 
  EXIST PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY CAN BE PATENTED, NOT BECAUSE
  THEY ARE THE SAFEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS. The 
  result is that the function of the FDA is the promotion 
  and protection of the pharmaceutical-industrial complex
  at the expense of consumer safety and access to options. 


</UL>
<p>
  No wonder that safe and effective alternative therapeutics, 
  such as vitamins and herbs, that are not patentable have
  been under attack from the FDA, with looming threats of 
  their being banned and forced to go through the FDA-
   protocol and then placed into the hands of the 
  wealthiest members of the pharmaceutical-industrial 
  complex who will sell those products at fantastically 
  inflated prices, as has happened in nations that have 
  followed through with vitamin restrictions. The con, by 
  design or default, is that the FDA is the champion of 
  anti-capitalist idealism when in fact it is the vehicle
  of the most vicious and predatory capitalism imaginable,
  a form of capitalism is that anti-free-market and promercantilism,
   ie, a form of capitalism directed not by 
  consumer demand but by authoritarian decree and force
  where consumers, rather than being the directors of the
  economy, are ripped off and plundered via State power.


<UL>
  <li>  To prove that the FDA is working to benefit society,
  we must show that there has been a decrease in harmful
  drugs after the FDA's existence and a steady rate or 
  increase of new effective drugs coming to market. A problem
  here is that the standard by which most will measure the 
  FDA is the FDA itself, that is, to determine the number 
  of unsafe drugs approved by the FDA we have to count the
  number of drugs the FDA has revoked its approval of.
  Like any enterprise, the FDA would have a disincentive
  to admit that it is making things worse, and thus would
  have a disincentive to revoke too many approved drugs, 
  just as laws that prove to be more harmful are rarely 
  ever revoked. Of course, there can be other means of 
  measuring drug safety, such as adverse reaction reports.


</UL>
<p>
  IN SUM: People usually think of life without some large
  government institution as a return to the jungle. They 
  seem to forget that tort liability still exists in the 
  free market and it exerts a powerful effect on actors 
  in the market, such that the threat of law suits for bad
  drugs will cause manufacturers and sellers to be careful.
  We also tend to forget that it's EASIER to bribe or slip
  bad data past an inspector or a small review panel than
  to do the same to a myriad randomly-selected juries and 
  hundreds research facilities operated around the world.
  Knowing that, companies would have an incentive to be 
  more careful when it's more difficult to bribe or lie,
  which suggests that a free market would regulate better.

<p>
  The result of slipping bad drugs past an organization 
  that issues authoritarian decrees of safety is by far 
  the greatest threat to public safety for it then gives
  a bad drug bullet-proof status and the drug will have 
  free reign to harm the people while it makes the 
  manufacturer millions and millions. If you study the
  case of Prozac and other SSRI drugs, the idea that the
  FDA will revoke approval of drugs due to extraordinary 
  rates of reported adverse reactions is not indicated. A 
  drug may be revoked if a negative study appears in one 
  of biggest medical journals, and if you look at these
  journals you will find them filled with advertisements
  from the very companies the journal would harm if it
  were to publish a study showing that one of the drug
  manufactures it does business with is selling a bad 
  drug. In short, if a drug manufacturer like Eli Lilly
  sends a journal X thousands of dollars per year, this
  payment is, on its face, a de-facto form of bribery
  to one of the main entities we have to rely upon to 
  keep the pharmaceutical-industrial complex honest.

<p>
  There is quite a lot more to be said in terms of how 
  the FDA causes harm, which is perhaps most evident in
  the cases of the routine delay life-saving therapeutics,
  which potentially causes more harm than harm caused by
  bad drugs getting out in the free market. The argument
  is convincing that tens of thousands died of a heart 
  condition that could have been easily treated by the 
  drug propranolol when the FDA kept it off the U.S. 
  market while it was available in Europe; and that 
  up to 100,000 die each year due to the FDA's ban on
  truthful health information about food and supplements
  (See "Freedom of Informed Choice: FDA Versus Nutrient
  Supplements," by Durk Pearson &amp; Sandy Shaw, 1993).
