Your story reminds me of a young guy I knew in the late '60's.  His 
relatives had him institutionalized because he stood to inherit money that 
they wanted.  He spent several years under repeated drug shock treatment to 
cure his "paranoia" - that his relatives were out to get him.  Then, in a 
stroke of incredible luck, his entire family was killed in an auto accident. 
  When the money dried up, suddenly he was CURED!  And released.  He was a 
strange person, but very gentle.  He spent a lot of time on spending that 
inheritance on the very best music and music systems available.  I suspect 
that at that point he needed professional help, but I don't think he would 
ever ask for it...
