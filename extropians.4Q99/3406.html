Actually, one probably could estimate it fairly accurately and on
a day when I'm really ambitious, I'll probably attempt that
(since its such a JUICY idea).  { Aside to female readers --
I am in no way trying to diminish your past/potential future
losses associated with abortions; I am however willing to separate
the emotional loss from the physical loss, since the physical
loss (and corresponding gains in other parts of the global
ecosystem) may be quantified. }

<p>
The great thing about it is that it provides a quantiative
relationship between the value of "human" vs. "non-human"
meat (meat intended as such, bygones for those offended).

<p>
Spike, my hat is off to you for the interesting insight.
It provides fertile ground for demonstrating to those
mono-thinking sub-cultures we encounter where their thinking
may be incomplete.<a name="3415qlink1">  As it says in the Bible -- man
should be the caretaker of the Earth, and if by sacrificing
ourselves or our children so that the Earth may fluorish,
then that must be Gods will....</a>   { My interpretation,
may be highly inaccurate, but given the contradictions
in the Bible, I doubt it... }  Personally, to me, it
makes much more sense economically, to sacrifice those
children before they have had an investment made in
them, not after they have reached the age of military
service....

<p>
And of course it demonstrates where our group-mind
(borganization) uplifting (by sharing novel ideas)
is of benefit to us all (the presence of children
not withstanding...)
