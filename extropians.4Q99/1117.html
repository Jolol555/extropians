<a name="1143qlink1">I just happened to get another callback from U of P and got</a> more info.  I was 
<a name="1143qlink2">told they are doing a study with the TMS and have done 400 people so</a> far with 
<a name="1143qlink3">4 having seizures which is the only serious side effect so far.  Also I was 
told they will give me more info if I pass the initial screening for the 
study, which I gave today.  I will probably wait longer to try</a> it unless they 
<a name="1143qlink4">tell me the 4 who had seizures were especially prone for some reason</a> and that 
<a name="1143qlink5">I probably wouldn't have that problem.
