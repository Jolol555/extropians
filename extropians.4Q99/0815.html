requires expensive radioactive material handling to put together.
However, my comments are based on historical anaylsis of the
cold war MAD approaches and previous efforts to develop anti-ballistic
missle systems.  Perhaps the costs in the equation have shifted
enough to require a re-examination.</a>

<a name="0850qlink2">Well, I don't think in general promoting the selling of advanced

history to mitigate their aggressive tendencies is a good idea.</a>
In general it results in an increase in my tax bill when we have
to send in machines &amp; people to keep those "local" conflicts from
growing into larger scale situations that get really expensive.

<p>
But on the note of cheap defensive weapons and the requirements
for highly accurate positioning of said weapons, you might want
to suggest or consider whether these requirements could be
diminished through the use of a "smart dust" warhead.  I just
read through the article about the work on Smart Dust being
done by UCB.  I could envision a situation where an anti-missle
missle could release a bunch of smart dust directly in front
of an incoming missle.  Since it could "explode" the dust into
a large cloud its accuracy requirements would be diminished.
The smart dust could then adhere to the missle and provide
local micro-explosions, or balloon itself (creating friction)
or activate micro actuators on one side of the missle that
deflect it, etc.  If you can make the dust as cheap as
conventional explosives (which seems like it should eventually
be true), then it seems you might have a much more effective
shield.

<a name="0850qlink3">Regarding the use of the uranium/plutonium as a "clean" energy
source -- you should know better.  Fission will never be a
clean energy source until you have nanotech microscales to
isolate each atom of radioactive isotopes generated for
"safe" disposal.</a>  There is a use for the materials which is
<a name="0850qlink4">in breeder reactors for alpha-particle emitting Gandolinium
for use in our own personal (body) nuclear power sources.</a>
The only "clean" power source is solar (or perhaps hydrothermal)
since one could argue cooling the core of the earth would
eventually stop continental drift and eliminate earthquakes.

<p>
Interesting question for the tree huggers:
<pre>
RB "Do you favor stopping continental drift?"
TH "Why would we want to do that?"
RB "Because over geologic time scales, the continents will
</pre>
<p>
    probably be repositioned in places that wipe out millions
    of species."
<br>
TH "Ok, then yes, we should stop continental drift."
RB "Do you have any ideas on how to do that without using advanced
<p>
    technologies?"
<br>
TH "Not at this moment..."
<br>
RB "I thought so."
