I, of course, strongly approve of Warwick's high-tech playfulness; now
&lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is the spirit of &lt;i&gt;neurohacking,&lt;/i&gt; and it's exactly the
attitude we need to face the future without panicking.  If you're going
to take on the job of navigating humanity into a future full of
nanotechnological weapons and neurosilicate interfaces and enhancive
neurosurgery and artificial intelligence, then the real test of your
spirit is whether you can have fun doing it.  Stick an implant in your
arm, smoke-test the first direct interface... hack up an AI, wire up the
amygdala and half the limbic system like Christmas trees...

A great and transcendent birth is about to take place.  Maybe we don't
know who will be born - humanity, or something else - but something will
be born on this planet, and screaming and trying to swim back into the
womb isn't going to help.  Why be afraid?  Being afraid isn't going to
help.  If you're going to walk along the edge of the abyss, you may as
<a name="1116qlink1">well dance.<a name="1079qlink1">  If all of humanity could face the creation of transhuman
intelligence with Warwick's sense of enthusiasm, I would not fear the outcome.</a>
