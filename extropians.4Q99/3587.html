<p>
By not having backup systems, it motivates people to keep their
high techy newfangled systems up and running.  Sink those lifeboats,
mates!  During the New York blackout of 1970-something,
there was much debate about how dependent we have become
on electricity.  Now this is taken for granted, and furthermore,
if the computer network goes down, we might as well all go home
from work, for there is *nothing* to do without em.  Right?  How
about you?  Other than EvMick, who among us can do our jobs
effectively *without* their computer? spike
