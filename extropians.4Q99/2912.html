The Singularity Shop Sketch

<p>
(a customer walks in the door)<br>

<p>
Customer: Good Morning.
<br>
Owner: Good morning, Sir. Welcome to the Planetary Singularity Emporium!
Customer: Ah, thank you, my good man.
<br>
Owner: What can I do for you, Sir?

<p>
C: Well, I was, uh, sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just
now, skimming through "True Names" by Vernor Vinge, and I suddenly came
over all hakraish.
<pre>
O: Hakraish, sir?
C: Beyondable.
O: Eh?

C: 'Ee, Ah wor 'anscendent-loike!
</pre>
<br>
O: Ah, Transcendent!
<br>
C: In a nutshell. And I thought to myself, "a little intelligence
enhancement will do the trick," so, I diverted my economic resources,
sallied forth, and infiltrated your place of purveyance to negotiate the
vending of some advanced ultratechnologies!
O: Come again?
<br>
C: I want to buy some ultratech.

<p>
O: Oh, I thought you were complaining about the governmental system!
C: Oh, heaven forbid: I am one who strictly observes the ramifications
of Clemmenson's Law!
<br>
O: Sorry?
<br>
C: 'Ooo, Ah mihnd mah own busihness, 'yer forced too!

<pre>
O: So they can go on governing, can they?
C: Most certainly! Now then, some tech please, my good man.
O: (lustily) Certainly, sir. What would you like?

</pre>
<p>
C: Well, eh, how about a little Utility Fog.
O: I'm, a-fraid we're fresh out of Utility Fog, sir.

<p>
C: Oh, never mind, how are you on artificial immune systems?
O: I'm afraid we never have that at the end of the week, sir, we get it
fresh on Monday.

<p>
C: Tish tish. No matter. Well, stout yeoman, four ounces of neural
growth factor, if you please.
<br>
O: Ah! It's beeeen on order, sir, for two weeks. Was expecting it this morning.

<p>
C: 'T's Not my lucky day, is it? Aah, genetic engineering for augmented intelligence?
O: Sorry, sir.

<p>
C: Neurohormones?
<br>
O: Normally, sir, yes. Today the van broke down.

<p>
C: Ah. Uplifting?
<br>
O: Sorry.

<p>
C: Self-optimizing compilers? Continuously optimized products?

<pre>
C: Cyc, perhaps?
O: Ah! We have Cyc, yessir.
C: (surprised) You do! Excellent.
O: Yessir. It's..ah,.....it's a bit crystalline...
C: Oh, I like it crystalline.
O: Well,.. It's very crystalline, actually, sir.
C: No matter. Fetch hither the fromage de la Douglas Lenat! Mmmwah!
O: I...think it's a bit more crystalline than you'll like it, sir.
C: I don't care how bloody crystalline it is. Hand it over with all speed.
O: Oooooooooohhh........! &lt;pause&gt;
C: What now?
O: The otter's eaten it.
C: &lt;pause&gt; Has she.
O: He, sir.

</pre>
<p>
(pause)<br>

O: No, sir.

<pre>
C: You...do *have* some Singularities, don't you?
O: (brightly) Of course, sir. It's a Singularity shop, sir. We've got--
C: No no... don't tell me. I'm keen to guess.
O: Fair enough.

C: Uuuuuh, Fast Burn Transcendence.
O: Yes?
</pre>
<br>
C: Ah, well, I'll have some of that!
<br>
O: Oh! I thought you were talking to me, sir. Mister Festburnt
Rance-Evans, that's my name.

<p>
(pause)<br>

<p>
C: Wormhole computing?
<br>
O: Uh, not as such.

<p>
C: Uuh, accelerated neurons?
<br>
O: no

<p>

<p>
(pause)<br>

<pre>
C: Aah, how about seed AI?
O: Well, we don't get much call for it around here, sir.
C: Not much ca-- It's the single most popular Singularity in the Universe!
O: Not 'round here, sir.

C: &lt;slight pause&gt; and what IS the most popular Singularity 'round hyah?
O: Uploading, sir.
C: IS it.
O: Oh, yes, it's staggeringly popular in this area, squire.
</pre>
C: Is it.
<br>
O: It's our number one best seller, sir!

<pre>
C: I see. Uuh...uploading, eh?
O: Right, sir.
C: All right. Okay. 'Have you got any?' he asked, expecting the answer 'no'.
O: I'll have a look, sir... nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno.

C: It's not much of a Singularity shop, is it?
O: Finest in the galaxy!
C: (annoyed) Explain the logic underlying that conclusion, please.
</pre>
O: Well, it's so clean, sir!
<br>
C: It's certainly uncontaminated by Singularities....

<pre>
O: (brightly) You haven't asked me about neurohacking, sir.
C: Would it be worth it?
O: Could be....
C: Have you --SHUT THAT BLOODY GOVERNMENT DOWN!
O: Told you sir....

C: (slowly) Have you got any neurohacks?
</pre>
O: No.
<br>
C: Figures. Predictable, really I suppose. It was an act of purest
optimism to have posed the question in the first place. Tell me:
O: Yessir?

<p>
C: (deliberately) Have you in fact got any sharp discontinuities in
technological progress at all.
<br>
O: Yes,sir.
