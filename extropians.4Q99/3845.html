<i>&gt;winter is very cold, but in the spring, leaves start to come out on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;trees.  The leaves absorb cold.  Therefore, the weather begins to grow</i><br>
<i>&gt;warm.  The leaves continue to grow, and absorb more cold all throughout</i><br>
<i>&gt;the summer, but eventually they are full of cold, and then they begin to</i><br>
<i>&gt;turn colors as a result.  They eventually die and fall from the trees, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;full of cold are they.  At that time, they release into the environment all</i><br>
<i>&gt;the cold that they had soaked up all spring and summer, and this causes</i><br>
<i>&gt;the weather to turn cold again.  spike</i><br>

Thank you for clearing that up, spike.

The science of cryonics will no doubt benefit tremendously from your splendid
insights, as will all other branches of the tree of knowledge. Now, onward to
the next mystery!

Bill Gates III of Microsoft is not the Antichrist? = 666 Bill Gates  real name
is William Henry Gates III In the Media today it is just  Bill Gates III (III
means the 3rd.)   If we use computer language      ASC II - Values and add
III -3 to his name we read this:
<pre>
B=66
I=73
L=76
L=76
G=71
A=65
T=84
E=69
S=83
</pre>
<br>
III=3
<br>
So-o-o Bill Gates III = 666 My old computer that I started with years ago, I had
to learn MS- DOS to make it work. M S - D O S 6 2 1
77+83+45+68+79+83+32+54+46+50+49 = 666 and if you don't like that try this: W I
N D O W S 9 6 87+73+78+68+79+87+83+57+54 = 666
