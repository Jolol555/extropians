&gt; I don't think we can answer this question well until we better understand

to

<p>
I do not get this at all -- it seems that bonds of social trust would have 
been more valuable in times of scarcity.  I'd appreciate a brief explanation 
of this idea.</a>

<p>
<a name="1920qlink2"><a href="1763.html#1904qlink3">&gt;  So will the people who dominate the future be those who follow their</a><br>

<i>&gt;  on the actual value of social bonding today relative to what we evolved</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to expect it to be.  And damned if I know the answer to this.</i><br>

<p>
Hmm -- you know, I interpreted this question to be more about "fun" than 
"idleness".  Maybe we read "leisure" differently</a> . . .
