<p>
Extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence. So far this only 
looks like sloppy science at best, conspiracy theory at worst. I will
not waste my time by looking into this, unless the adherents can
produce dramatic evidence (where are all these working setups?).

<a href="3161.html#3270qlink1"> &gt; Among Gina's most recent offerings was this link to a Wired article about the </a><br>
<i> &gt; current state of cold fusion research:</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt;       <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.11/coldfusion.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.11/coldfusion.html</a></i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; I recommend it.  It's a very well written piece of "science anthropological </i><br>
<i> &gt; journalism" about the history and current state of the cold fusion research </i><br>
<i> &gt; community.  I'm not competent to judge the technical merits of anything </i><br>
<i> &gt; that's described in the article, but WOULD be curious to see the reactions of </i><br>
<i> &gt; folks better able to assess the current state of the art described there.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; One thing that was a little disturbing about the article was the account of </i><br>
<i> &gt; how the scientific and R&amp;D community seems set against even a moderately </i><br>
<i> &gt; funded investigation of what is an undeniably interesting and mysterious </i><br>
<i> &gt; physical phenomenon.  What's described in the Wired article seems well worth </i><br>
<i> &gt; looking into.</i><br>
