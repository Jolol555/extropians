<a href="3712.html#3715qlink1">&gt; Can someone please explain their motive for creating an AI in the first </a><br>
<i>&gt; place.  What would you use it for?</i><br>

<p>
Eliezer has a Very interesting reason for why we would want to build an AI
on his website:

<p>
<a href="http://singularity.posthuman.com/tmol-faq/meaningoflife.html">http://singularity.posthuman.com/tmol-faq/meaningoflife.html</a>

<p>
At the risk of oversimplifying his position, (which is actually quite
lengthy and worth the read, whether you agree with it or not,) the purpose
of building an AI is to build something smarter than us, so it can tell us
what the real meaning of life is.  Analogies to Douglas Adams' "Deep
Thought" machine in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are not far from the
mark; except that we DO know the question we have in mind.

<p>
It should also be noted that "uploading" is just a special kind of
artificial intelligence; many people see that to be the most likely way
they'll manage to live forever.

<p>
Drexler argued in his book, Engines of Creation, that we'll probably need
artificial intelligence to figure out how to program nano-assemblers to do
interesting things.

<p>
Alexander Chislenko has argued that with the coming of intelligent agents
and their infiltration into the economy, we'll move into what he calls a
"hyper-economy," bringing greater wealth/utility to all.
