<a href="3757.html#3796qlink1">&gt;&gt;How do you want to use (non-sentient, I assume) AI to become immortal, btw?&lt;&lt;</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3815qlink1">I have a hypothesis that consciousness is nothing more than memory exchanges in the brain along with a pattern matching and pattern searching (guessing what will come next) processes.</a>

<p>
My guess is when the brain stores information from sensory stimulation they are stored together by time with some parts of memory having a greater relevance to others, so one doesn't associate a hand movement with a sound as easily as they might with sound and sight.

<p>
The idea is by studying the interactions between these associations I can create a self-aware AI.  Once that is accomplished then I can begin work on sight, sound, etc. interfaces with my AI "brain".  Then I will create a robot that uses this brain and study its effects.  Because the robot uses a brain that relies on associations for reasoning just as we humans do it will learn language, be self-aware, and be able to communicate its thoughts with me.

<p>
<i>&gt;From there I can replace parts of my brain with robotics, or I can reroute signals from my brain into my AI brain interfaced with an avatar in a virtual world.</i><br>
