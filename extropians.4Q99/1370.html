<a name="1372qlink2">My last girlfriend was a driven, career-oriented woman, but she had little use for the present state of the feminist movement.  She appreciated the work that had been done that allowed her to enter the work-place, but she felt that the next step was up to her in actually living her life, not complaining for the sake of complaining.

I have often thought that some of the theories from evolutionary psychology of the last few years are an insightful (and perilous?) place for a man and a women to begin the sometimes arduous task of communicating with each other.  It is less a than flattering picture, for men more so than women, (in particular, I'm thinking of Steven Pinker's last book, I think its called HOW THE MIND WORKS)  but at least it is a framework.  Camile Pagila, and like minded feminists seem willing to confront these physiological differences and use them to learn about how to get along.
