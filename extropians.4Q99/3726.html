'What is your name?'  'Damien Broderick.'  'Well, in THAT case...':

<i>&gt; Under a certain pressure from empirical investigation, I think, `think' and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Think that this sort of distinction just folds up. </i><br>

<p>
Ah, the venerable "aw, come on!" response.  When the going gets tough, the
tough get satirical.  Dennett has a great line on this in Quining Qualia:

<p>
"Today, no biologist would dream of supposing that it was quite all right
to appeal to some innocent concept of elan vital. [...] What are qualia,
*exactly*? This obstreperous query is dismissed by one author ("only half
in jest") by invoking Louis Armstrong's legendary reply when asked what
jazz was: "If you got to ask, you ain't never gonna get to know." (Block,
1978, p.281) This amusing tactic perfectly illustrates the presumption
that is my target. If I succeed in my task [of showing that qualia do not
exist], this move, which passes muster in most circles today, will look as
quaint and insupportable as a jocular appeal to the ludicrousness of a
living thing--a living thing, mind you!--doubting the existence of elan
vital."

<p>
<a href="3720.html#3726qlink2">&gt; But I know that if stem cells were injected into my brain, and tweaked just</a><br>
<i>&gt; right to grow back some relevant cortex, and I was trained to use it, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible that depth would abruptly `pop out' for me. I'd have new qualia</i><br>
<i>&gt; that are inconceivable to me right now, strictly speaking. Does that make</i><br>
<i>&gt; me a partial zombie? Not. (But then I'd say that, wouldn't I? Throw stones</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the zombie, he can't duck!)</i><br>

<p>
And this shows you have qualia... how?  I'm saying we're ALL "zombies,"
that NONE of us have ANY qualia.  You're no half zombie, you're 100% FULL
zombie, just like me.
