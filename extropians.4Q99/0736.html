	This list has always been, and always should be about the rational
discussion of extropic topics...not discussions about friends and enemies.
Logically, every list member has slightly (and sometimes vastly) different
views on certain subjects, and should post accordingly.  However, the
catalysts are rationalism, respect and pertinency...not friendship and
niceties --I'm sure there are many other lists which place those values as
primarily important.

<p>
	Just for the record, I for one, have not seen anything recently which even
remotely resembles animosity...I just see differences in objectives.
