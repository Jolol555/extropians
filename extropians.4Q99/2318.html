<p>
Has anyone read the excellent sci-fi book entitled Einstein's Bridge by Prof. 
Cramer from UC Berkeley (I believe).   Written in the mid-90's, its ends up 
being another 'go back in time and change the outcome of the earth' (the 
protagonists had opened up a bridge, courtesy of the SSC (super collider) in 
the early years of the 21st century, and nightmarish nano-creatures from a 
hive-like intelligence quickly enter via the bridge and begin destroying the 
earth's inhabitants.) Cramer's premise was that by going back in time, say 15 
years, possibly in an alternate universe, the SSC project was stopped (as it 
was in our reality), and henceforth, humanity is saved.
The question Cramer puts forth is that, when the scientists went back in time 
15 years, to the good ol 90's, the original earth's reality (with the hive 
nano-creatures) therefore never happened.  If so, does that mean that the enti
re Universe in that initial<a name="2348qlink1"> reality also never happened?</a>  I always get bogged 
down with alternate reality stories<a name="2348qlink2"> in that Cramer, and others seem to me to 
imply that only the local reality (viz, the earth, perhaps the solar system) 
is forever changed.  Well, then, what happens to the rest of the universe???</a>
Thanks for any inquiries.
