<a href="1327.html#1336qlink1">&gt; The guy from the JPL who viewed my Bioastronomy paper said the requirement</a><br>
<i>&gt; for a CC was under question. </i><br>

<p>
This is good news. After all, it is to my knowledge the natural
constant with the smallest magnitude so far, so uncertainty about it
seems likely.

<p>
<a href="1327.html#1336qlink2">&gt; I believe the assumption is that</a><br>
<i>&gt; Supernovas have the same brightness at all ages and that is very</i><br>
<i>&gt; iffy IMO unless you can prove that the composition of the SNs is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same.  Distant/Old SNs occur in an "unintelligent"/"virginal" universe,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Recent/Near SNs occur (potentially) in an "intelligent"/"engineered"</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe.</i><br>

<p>
Besides, there is more heavy elements around these days, and they
might act as catalysts for various reactions.

<p>
<a href="1327.html#1336qlink3">&gt; So, what's the problem?  In 50 years we send out 200 billion AI</a><br>
<i>&gt; nanoships to each galaxy at .99c.  They reach all of the galaxies</i><br>
<i>&gt; (in something around 18-20 billion light years), astroengineer them into</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kardashev Type III galaxy-ships (take a billion years, we've got</i><br>
<i>&gt; plenty of time), compute how much energy &amp; matter must be expended</i><br>
<i>&gt; to turn the ships around and get them back to the origin by</i><br>
<i>&gt; CurrentEra+149 billion years.   The matter and energy expended</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the process is lost to the expanding universe (operating costs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; what can you do?), but most of the matter and energy of any use gets</i><br>
<i>&gt; returned to the starting point (presumably at sub-black-hole densities).</i><br>

<p>
Sounds reasonable. (And I mean it. The details are just engineering :-)

<p>
One problem might be avoiding collapse - it is possible to do if you
rotate or charge matter, but in this case it has to be done in-flight
and mistakes are going to be costly.

<p>
What if there are another group of postaliens out there, trying to
drag all their mass to *their* origo? Sounds like a transhumanist
space opera - "Galaxy Rangers" :-)
 
<p>
<a href="1327.html#1336qlink4">&gt; So now you have most of the M&amp;E in the universe in one place.</a><br>
<i>&gt; Construct a single-crystaline ultra-SI and spend the rest of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time (&gt; 10^89 years until all the matter evaporates) throwing</i><br>
<i>&gt; information bottles into subspace or building alternate universes</i><br>
<i>&gt; and tunnels into them.</i><br>

<p>
I wonder about the heat dissipation of the SCUSI; my biggest jupiter
brain in my paper was just a billion degree quark matter structure,
this may have some problems dissipating energy well. Sounds like a
follow up paper - "everyday life among the galaxy brains".
 
<p>
<a href="1327.html#1336qlink5">&gt; Whenever we read papers regarding current perspectives on physics</a><br>
<i>&gt; and astronomy, it is almost always done from the Occams Razor</i><br>
<i>&gt; bias that "intelligence" is hard and rare.  Flip the position!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; What if "intelligence" is easy and common?  What if the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; is populated/dominated by entitites at the end points of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution of an Extropian philosophy?  What if the **simplest**</i><br>
<i>&gt; explanation for what we observe *has* to incorporate the evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; of intelligence to the allowable limits?</i><br>

<p>
Why stars? :-)

<p>
<a href="1327.html#1336qlink6">&gt; We shouldn't be studying negative energy, we should be looking</a><br>
<i>&gt; for disappearing mass.   We should be trying to figure out ways</i><br>
<i>&gt; of standing on the shoulders of those who have had a lot more time</i><br>
<i>&gt; to think about these problems than we have had.</i><br>

<p>
What if all the missing mass really is missing, the gravitational
effects have just not become obvious?

<p>
<a href="1327.html#1336qlink7">&gt; &gt; Perhaps the most optimistic thing about these two papers is not their</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; conclusions, but the fact that physical eschatology and the effects</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; intelligent life can have on the universe are not being increasingly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; studied by physicists. It is hardly a mainstream topic, but it is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; longer utterly beyond the pale.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ... Until the sub-SI-Robert showed them how to do it...</i><br>

<p>
Do drop in when you are here in Stockholm to get your Nobel prizes :-)
