<i>&gt;      &gt;Qualia to me seems to be the experiencing of our own neuro-chemical</i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;reactions</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So chemical reactions are warm and fuzzy but electrical reactions are</i><br>
<i>&gt;cold and logical? It doesn't seem likely.</i><br>

<a name="3789qlink1">Our neuro-chemical (carried by electrical) reactions are capable</a> of the full 
spectrum of emotions, warm, cold, fuzzy, logical, etc.  The input 
(perception tools) are standard and uniform for us, but our interpretation 
of the input data is individual and related to our own associated memories 
and attitudes.  Our qualia is personal.

<i>&gt;A much better question is, what would AI's use us for anyway?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3789qlink2">Why create an AI that would use us?  The plantation owners didn't</a> bring 
slaves over to tell them how to run their cotton business.  They brought 
slaves so the owner could sit on his lazy duff and enjoy his free time and 
Victorian life-style while they did his work.  The problem, was that the 
slaves were human and had qualia, and didn't enjoy the abuse.  They 
understood it was a raw deal.  (I would have been an abolishonist in those 
days)  SO why put qualia in an AI who might rebel against what you ask it to 
do?  No feelings hurt if it doesn't have them.  Why give it the opportunity 
to be lazy, get frightened, or be dicontented?   Isn't the push for AI's 
rooted in creating a machine to do our work/thinking for us?  Correct me if 
I'm wrong.

<a href="3594.html#3688qlink3">&gt;     &gt;Qualia is a distraction to getting the job done!!!</a><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3618.html#3688qlink4">&gt;The job random mutation and natural selection wanted to get done is </a><br>
<i>&gt;survival,</i><br>
<i>&gt;if qualia is just a handicap to that then why did evolution give it to me </i><br>
<i>&gt;and</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps to you too?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3789qlink3">Maybe the job of the human species is not survival.  Perhaps our job</a> is 
rooted in curiosity and discovery.  Columbus didn't sail into the vast 
unknown for survival reasons, (odds were high that he would die on such a 
mission)he was driven by curiosity, quest, furthur!!!  Survival placed 
second to discovery.

<p>
<a name="3789qlink4">If we plan to go to Mars, a seemingly dangerous trip, should we send</a> a 
human, or an AI who is capable of collecting the same data?  I'd recommend 
an AI, but if you install qualia in this AI, it will be freaking out and 
most likely will not want to go due to the threat to its life.  It might 
also get lonely.  These emotions and qualia would then get in the way of 
getting the data collecting job done!!!
