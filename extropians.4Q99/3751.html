<p>
Thank you! Hearing this from a highly creative person like you, who
definitely stretch our imagination with your work, is double praise! I
hope to set up a little gallery with the (best) pictures from the
site, perhaps giving another angle on the world.

<p>
As for your morning, it seems like you have become a victim of the
"curse of Big Ideas" - I have found myself several times sitting in
the late night hours happily working on some part of the setting,
running a continous internal debate about the relative merits of going
to bed and getting up in a reasonable time to do some work, and the
merits of really describing the evolutionary history of the Trahans in
depth and how that is reflected in their art. You can guess which
voice usually wins... 

<p>
So you have the problem with cats waking you up too? My cat has finaly
given up on trying to wake me, I'm far too sleepy due to my long
nights :-)

<p>
<a href="3665.html#3751qlink2">&gt; If I had one wish this morning, it would be to slip inside your</a><br>
<i>&gt; mind, even for a moment to enjoy your imagination fully.</i><br>

<p>
Given the timestamp on your post, you would have found me in the
middle of baking cookies for christmas - perhaps less imagination than
hedonic anticipation :-)

<p>
<a href="3665.html#3751qlink3">&gt; (Psst ... now get on with your "more serious pursuits" with equal energy)</a><br>

<p>
You mean eating the cookies?
