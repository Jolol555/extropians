Actually it varies totally from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  There are 
virtually no state requirements in California for elementary or high 
schools, but local and zoning laws can kill you.  Also, the insurance has 
been really bad ever since the McMartin Preschool case and the following 
years of witch hunts, which cost millions of dollars, made the reps for the 
idiot prosecutors and the psychotherapists who convinced the kids of 
complete fantasies (therapist - the rapist) - which netted virtually no 
actual molestors.  We're still paying bigtime for that nonsense.
That's if you're talking above 6 years old.  In most states, Californiz 
being one of the worst, below six means unbelievably stupid, expensive 
regulations put there by social services at the advice of experts from 
academia financed by the teachers union, which wants to force day care to 
become public, by pricing it out of the market for most parents, so that 
they can add 15% to their union roll.
