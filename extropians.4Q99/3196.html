I once watched our pet poodle (male) attempt my mothers leg, needless
to say she was not pleased.  What was interesting was that if you
left the poodle alone for an extended period he got very excited
when you returned and that excitement often translated into sexual
arousal.  And of course you have various sites scattered around the
internet dedicated to what people on farms with only a couple of
TV channels to watch will do for entertainment.

It was interesting passing through Amarillo, TX last year (on one
of my cross country jaunts).  One of the bartenders in a local
country &amp; western dance club told my brother that there were
only two things to do in the town -- dance [presumably as a prelude
to doing the horizontal mambo] and get drunk.  Of course Amarillo
makes for an interesting case study as on the very same trip I
happened to be reading "The Secret Mesa: Inside Los Alamos National
Laboratory", and there is a paragraph in the book about the
<a name="3214qlink1">factory in Amarillo that dis[assembles] our WOMD.  Connecting
the dots it became obvious that that was what the huge assembly
of buildings and lights just NE of Amarillo was that wasn't on
any of the maps.</a>  It is also the shadow that the town lived under
which was enlightening in reflecting on the bartenders comments.
<a name="3440qlink1">{ Wishing to elevate myself to the level of the more erudite members
of the list, it seems like this may be an interesting example
of "Carp Diem"</a> (sieze the day). }

Getting back to sex (which is why those of you reading this
message are reading it, oui?), it seems that Gina's comments
regarding an increase in homosexuality in high density populations
(e.g. cities) deserves some exploration.  Presumably in any
"social society" (human, primate, canine) there are behaviors
that are "acceptable" and those that are "unacceptable".
In a normal population there will be individuals at the
extreme ends of the spectrum (e.g. nymphomaniacs &amp; celibates).
In a small community the peer pressure will tend to push
these outliers towards the center.  However in a large
population congregation, such as a city, you have an opportunity
for the outliers to create a large enough "society" that it is capable
of resisting pressure from those of a different perspective.

<p>
So the development/acceptance of alternate sexual behavior patterns
that occurs in cities may be nothing more than a social phenomena
that occurs as a result of sufficient numbers of similar individuals
that one can effectively resist peer pressure to be "normal".
