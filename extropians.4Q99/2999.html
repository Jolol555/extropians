&lt;&lt; And why should the rational course necessarily be determined the simple
 summation of all future pleasurable experiences? It seems to me
 there's a factor in the sequence which decays over time - I wouldn't
 submit to a million years of agony, starting now, even if the
 following million were quite nice.

 Pleasure is a good way to pass the time, but being dead doesn't mean
 you've lost, it means you've stopped playing the game. Honestly, I
 can't imagine anything more horrible than the prospect of living
 literally forever.

If a million years is what it takes (and believe me I will look for other 
ways) then that is what I'll do.  Personally, I can only think of a few 
things more horrible than not living literally forever (perhaps nobody living 
literally forever might be worse).
