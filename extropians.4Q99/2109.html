I have noticed that often, when people are talking about transhumanism and 
posthumanity, there is an undercurrent or sometimes outright statement that 
being "human" is bad and that progressing from humanity through transhumanity 
to posthumanity will purge all that  "human" stuff. 

<p>
Well, "human" and "humanity" are terms with many layers of possible meaning 
(it's almost as bad as "God").  However, to most people that I know, it has 
generally good conotations and often represents what they cherish most in 
themselves, others, and their cultures.  So to suggest that we need to 
somehow abandon our humanity often leads to a nature defensive reaction.  
They think you're talking about eliminating most of what they value in life.  

<p>
When I talk about the desire to be transhuman or even posthuman, I try to 
keep an emphasis on the "human".  I want to take what is best about being 
human, and expand upon it.  Perhaps I am conservative in this regard.  I want 
to preserve indefinitely the joys I currently have in life, and expand to 
encompass new ones.  I believe the being I seek to become will have as much 
emphasis on the human as the trans or post.

<a name="2127qlink1">I keep coming back to the idea of childhood.  I have always been an odd 
combination of young and old.  When I was a child, I often took part in the 
adult conversations, and was interested in adult things, but I also liked to 
climb trees and ride my bike.  And even at an early age, I said that I wanted 
to enjoy the age I was when I was that age, for it would come only once.  
Back then I was fresh and excited to discover the wide world, yet it was like 
there was a wise old voice in the back of my mind guiding me.  As I grew 
older, I have worked hard to keep my childlike wonder and joy in life, so now 
there is a youthful voice in the back of my head laughing and urging me</a> to 
play.

<p>
I see transhumanism in much the same light.  In my humanhood, I have the 
voice of the posthuman I will become guiding me forward, but I like being 
human.  And when I pass through the singularity, I fully expect to enjoy my 
posthumanity, and to have a human voice in my mind reminding of what wonder 
there is in being a young sentient.<a name="2129qlink1">  I will no more discard the human I am 
now than I would the child I once was.  They are all me, and I cherish every 
facet even as I seek to grow more.</a>

<p>
This is my vision of transhumanism.  I believe it is also one that is less 
threatening to the general population.  If any of you believe we should 
abandon all of our humanity, even what is good, then I must disagree.  I tend 
to think, however, that this is not the goal of most transhumans.  If that is 
so, then please, be thoughtful about how you use the term "human".  It means 
more than meat and irrationality, and I think we might be alienating people 
from transhumanity who might truly benefit from it.
