What about the possibility that Microsoft and/or Intel do currently face
significant competition or could face significant competition in the
future if they don't merge?</a>

<a name="0225qlink2">The advantage of these agreements compared to cartels is that they would
be legally enforceable. I don't see why they would be harder to enforce
than any other legal contract where monitoring would be required. Patent
licenses for example. If Intel and Microsoft don't currently have these
kinds of agreements in place, I think we should encourage them to make
these agreements rather than to merge.</a>

<p>
Perhaps Microsoft should issue stock options to Intel employees (at least
to the ones who have authority to set prices) and vice versa?
