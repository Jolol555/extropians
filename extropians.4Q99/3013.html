<p>
I'm not really sure what Borganism</a> is.  I think it has something to do with  
a StarTrek movie or one of it's clones.  I'm not allowed to watch SF movies 
(mostly)....because it criticize perceived inaccuracies too much and ruin it 
for those I watch it with......usually.....sometimes..

<p>
That aside....if "borganism" has something to do with "cyborg"....then count 
me in.

<p>
Even though  I was VERY critical of Steve Austin  ( .........Really!...just 
because you have a bionic arm of great strength...if you use it to overload  
your spine by lifting an automobile...youre spine is still going to 
snap...only his never did).....I really really did like the concept...and 
still do.

<p>
Like Daniel Keys Moran's cyborgs...or "mannie" (Moon is a harsh Mistress) and 
others...
