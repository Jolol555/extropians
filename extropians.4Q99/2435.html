<p>
I'm sorry I don't know who I am responding to here, but at any rate it
seems just as illogical to refer to "self" as a "quality" as it would be to
regard it as a "quantity".  A quality is a predicate; so what subject or
substance exists such that we can attribute "self-ness" to it?  Note
that whatever it is, it cannot BE a self, but must have the property or
attribute of "self" -- "The grass is green" does not mean that grass IS
"green-ness".

<p>
<a href="2410.html#2435qlink2">&gt; I like what you say here.  But I think you're glossing over how intertwined,</a><br>
<i>&gt; your well being is with the well being of others.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, Cynthia, it seems to me that "self" is a relation but not a relatum; I
mean that "interpersonal" is redundant.  Subjects of sensory deprivation
experiments report, not an exacerbation of "self-consciousness" but
rather a dissociative state in which eidetic imagery constitutes their
universe devoid of any subject-object dichotomy.  "Self-consciousness"
seems to me precisely that condition induced by a perception of some
<a name="2442qlink1">"object" interpreted as an  "other" (that is, a mirror phenomenon,</a> the
object being "another self"). In my opinion, what is usually regarded as
<a name="2442qlink2">"self-awareness" is either a subvocal monologue misconstrued as a dialog,</a>
or a unity attributed to a set of serial memories.

<p>
I realize this is very general, but a concrete illustration would be a person
total isolated from others, with no immediate expectation of rejoining a
community, who quickly creates the relationship called "self" by means
of a constructed duality. There cannot be an "I" without a "Me".

<p>
Finally, I am not denying the reality of individuation; I only mean to assert
that what is meant generally by "self" is a social construct and if reified or
hypostatized as a "substance" the result is an illusion.

<p>
Thank you for your post,

<p>
Bob
