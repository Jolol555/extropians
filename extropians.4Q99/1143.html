<a name="1170qlink1">I consulted, Sherry, with several psychiatrist friends of mine who
told me to assure you that the transcranial magnetic medium is
indicated for SOME clinical groups and is being used to produce
frequently significant symptomatic reduction without excessive
reliance on psychotropic agents.</a>

<p>
The only group they mentioned for which this treatment is contraindicated
 is the geriatric population with OBS or other neurological
disorders. They considered you qualified for this procedure, which
is much safer than ECT because [1] no anesthesia is required, and
[2] no paralytic agent such as curare or the reduced effectiveness
of unilateral application to prevent convulsions need be used since
no epileptiform incidents have been reported.  The treatment is quite
benign, the trade-off being that it is, other things being equal, less
effective statistically for the fairly rapid symtomatic reduction
associated with ECT.

<p>
They STRESSED that, at the present time, most insurance carriers
do NOT cover this treatment, and urged you to make complete
inquiries, unless this is not an issue for you.

<p>
Best wishes,
