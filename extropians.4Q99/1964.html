Sorry Starman; I personally hold that Mormons are Christian, but the Joseph 
Smith's revelation puts it in a grey area(for some).  Lets call it 
"Christ-Centered" and be done with it. Both the Mormons and Southern Baptists 
love to missionize and it is gernerally why there is antagonism between them, 
asside from the doctrines of Joseph Smith.

For many on this list, they seem to have been scalded by their encounters 
with Fundamentalism and abdure (5.00 word) anything remotely religious, as a 
result.
