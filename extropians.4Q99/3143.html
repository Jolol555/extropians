Octopodes!  The word comes from Greek not Latin roots.:):):)

<p>
That is interesting.  I imagine this is because of the flexibility.

Weird only to those used to other norms.

<a href="3112.html#3143qlink3">&gt; Build your own scenario.</a><br>

<p>
As for scenarios, a few years back, I added my admittedly amateur fiction
works to the list of those on uplifting (a list which includes writers like
Olaf Stapeldon and David Brin).  I wrote two science fiction stories, "Other
Minds" and "Splitting Hares" that dealt with uplifting animals.  I hope to
have the former up on web site in a few weeks.  (I have to type it in from
hardcopies! :@  Not that it's all that good.  Remember I did say and mean
"amateur.":)

<p>
In this vein, it might be good to develop a list of all the works,
nonfiction and fiction, on this topic as an quick way to get an "education"
for those interested.

<p>
I will start here.


<OL>
  <li>  _Sirius_ by Olaf Stapeldon (novel)
  <li>  "Run, Bookworm, run!" by Vernor Vinge (short story)
  <li>  The _Sundiver_ series by David Brin (novels)


</OL>
<p>
By no means is this comprehensive.  I hope it will prove a seed for others
to add to.

<p>
<i>&gt; I don't eat octopus any more.</i><br>

<p>
Nor do I.:)

Cheers!
