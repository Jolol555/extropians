<a name="3751qlink1">I couldn't sleep this morning (the cats work me up), so I thought I'll do a
little work before the world wakes up and the phone starts ringing.  Little
did I realize that by checking my email that my plans for a fastidious and
productive morning would be SHATTERED!   Once checking out your newly
launched Web site, I can no longer stretch my own imagination this morning
-- you have done that for me.  You, dear Anders, are amazing.</a>

<p>
This site is so rich and full of ideas and simply beautiful to look at.
While reading parts of the story, I glanced into the living room to catch a
glimpse of the glass blown artifact you gave to us on you last stay here.
The quality of art in this glass piece reflects the quality of creative
mind you share in your story ideas.

<p>
<a name="3751qlink2">If I had one wish this morning, it would be to slip inside your mind, even
for a moment to enjoy your imagination fully.</a>  Some day we will be able to
share mental and sensorial experiences, but until then, thank you for the
written exploration.

<p>
With admiration -
<br>
Cheers!
