 The subjectivity is not the problem. The unworkable, over complicated
 rulebook where one central guideline will do is the problem.

<a name="1499qlink2">I am not quite sure who's rulebook you are talking about.. I don;t remember 
there being mention of one in this thread.</a> 

<p>
&gt;Also, I don't
<br>
 care if my thoughts are considered condescending or seen as heresy or
 whatever, this isn't relevant to whether or not the idea is workable.&gt;&gt;

<a name="1499qlink4">Condescension and heresy aren't the same thing at all, why would you group 
them as one?</a>

<p>
 The one solution? Your words, not mine.....and it's not that brilliant
 either. It's blatantly obvious.

<p>
<a name="1499qlink6">You said something once which started this whole thing... what was it, all 
the morals we need to know are not to harm anyone? Something along those 
</a>lines. 

<p>
&gt;&gt; But people never bother to think (except
 people such as those on this list).... &gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="1499qlink8">Again, which people are you talking about?  What I mean by condescending is 
exemplified above. It isn't heretical, just disrespectful.
