<a name="0227qlink1">Well, I do.  First of all, Robin is far more insightful that Eliezer in the
field of economics and since my knowledge of economics is weak I'd take
Robin's word over Eliezer's.  I'd do this even if Eliezer told me that he
has read hundreds of economics books.  Why?  Because I'd rather take the
word of someone who has been forced to do general studies of the subject
than someone who has selected books to read on that subject.

<a name="0097qlink1">This doesn't mean I take everything a PhD says as law.  As a general rule I
never pay any attention to psychologists, people with 'evolutionary' in
their title, artificial intelligence researchers, geneticists, or anyone
who's spent time at the Santa Fe Institute.
