To John and Joe,

<p>
I believe "omnipotence" essentially implies "unlimited or infinite power"
Your question reminds me one one of Kant's "Antinomies of Pure Reason"
which was a precursor of Russell's Paradox and Goedel's conclusion that
self-referentiality must end in paradox and infinite recursion.  You know,
if the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into.  You need a whole
new non-Euclidean geometry for that one. So, I think the question "can
a limitless being create a limitless object leads to a Truth Table that will
rapidly self-destruct.  By the way, Cantor eventually went mad, as you
will recall, from trying to specify "a limit of limits".

<p>
Now, Joe, Spinoza and others have struggled with the problem of the
determinacy of the future; maybe that's why the Deists, along with
Newton, just left it at "he made the clock, wound it up, and went away".
Its a kind of quasi-indeterminacy issue; "if you knew what was going
to happen, could you change it?", and  "if you could observe the future
would your act of observation change it?". I must admit that our
remarkable ability to predict the past and to make nothing but true
statements about it depends precisely on its immutability.

<p>
Conclusion, both of you are involved in the problem of paradoxicality,
double jeopardy and "Catch 22".  Evidently the only way to resolve such
issues is to construct a meta-system which places them in a soluble context.


<p>
Would this exercise be worthwhile?  I doubt it -- we simply have no idea
what we're talking about when we use these "omni-" terms. I used them
as theological concepts to respond to a theological statement, not
because I thought they were non-vacuous.

<p>
Bob
