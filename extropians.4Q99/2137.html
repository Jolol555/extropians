Of what use is your belief in your current temporal life; how do you
know, as opposed to imagine, that there exists a distinct substance
having the attributes denoted by "Replicant"? Introspect: don't you
find that every referent of the pronoun "I" is a memory, and that you
cannot perceive any object called "Replicant" except a complex of
images and associations referred to the past of this non-existent
object by means of recollection?

<p>
There is no difference whatever psychodynamically between recalling
the past of your postulated current existence and recalling a postulated
personal existence that existed in the past.  Who you once were, now
are, and will be may all be involuntary fantasies which do not exist in
"your" consciousness but simply in the stream of "a" consciousness.
