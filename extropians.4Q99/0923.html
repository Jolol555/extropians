<i>&gt;This is the cutting edge of state censorship, the wedge to insinuate total </i><br>

<i>&gt;politically or economically unpopular away for life just by planting a gram </i><br>
<i>&gt;or two of controlled substance during a bust.  The War on Drugs is clearly </i><br>
<i>&gt;a failure</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the standpoint of controlling drug use, but it is an outstanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;success from the standpoint of putting undesireable people - from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;standpoint of the powers that be - away, and setting an example for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;next fool who might stick his head up. Am I being paranoid.  Perhaps not </i><br>
<i>&gt;enuf.  Consider that the anti-kiddie-port sections of the CDA specifically, </i><br>
<i>&gt;as I recall, include ANY depiction of child sexuality.  This includes - and </i><br>
<i>&gt;there have been prosecutions on this basis - comic art, furry art, etc., in </i><br>
<i>&gt;which children obviously were not employed.  For that matter, the same kind </i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;of software that can age or un-age a person's face could just as easilly do </i><br>
<i>&gt;the same for the entire body.  You could digitize Deep Throat and run it </i><br>
<i>&gt;through frame by frame and end up with 90 year olds having sex - or 9 year </i><br>
<i>&gt;olds. The alleged purpose of the law was to keep children from being </i><br>
<i>&gt;exploited, yet the language of the law is something else entirely, and, as </i><br>
<i>&gt;I noted, there have been prosecutions for such things as comic art </i><br>
<i>&gt;depicting minors having sex. So, the standard has been set. If we are </i><br>
<i>&gt;enough offended, then to hell with the 1st Amendment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bottom line: if exropians, of all people, can seriously discuss whether or </i><br>
<i>&gt;not someone should be allowed to discuss certain topics, then perhaps the </i><br>
<i>&gt;future is already lost.  Certainly anyone can filter out anyone else, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;certainly the extropian newsgroup can exclude anyone they choose from </i><br>
<i>&gt;access to their private area for stating unpopular opinions.  Doing so, </i><br>
<i>&gt;however, would be the end of extropianism.</i><br>

<p>
It's amazing how we think along the same lines here.  But give me your 
opinion on this.  How about, as soon as it's possible a planetary government 
with open citizenship but as soon as you attempt to sensor somebody your ass 
is deported.
