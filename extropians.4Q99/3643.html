<a href="3631.html#3643qlink1">&gt;One of the great failures of reasoning to which people are generally</a><br>

essential to

<a href="3631.html#3643qlink5">&gt;rubbish.  Vitalism went this way, together with mountains of mumbo jumbo</a><br>

Great, so tell us how.
<br>
Until then, I favor Chalmers over Dennett. There is a quote I like which
really sums up the situation on consciousness:

<p>
"At the present time the status of physicalism [your view] is similar to
that which the
<p>
     hypothesis that matter is energy would have had if uttered by a
pre-Socratic
<p>
     philosopher. We do not have the beginnings of a conception of how it
might be
<p>
     true. In order to understand the hypothesis that a mental event is a
physical
<p>
     event, we require more than an understanding of the word 'is'." -
Thomas Nagel

<p>
Qualia are REAL. This is undeniable. They are not a hypothesis used to
explain a phenomena - they are a phenomena which make themselves immediately
accessible to whoever experiences them. They are the fact which other
hypothesi must explain. I suspect (strongly) that they are intimately tied
to, or are caused by, or perhaps just "are" physical phenomena, in the sense
that holograms are light.<a name="3669qlink1"> People who deny their existence remind me of the
Mr. Spock stereotyped scientist portrayed on tv who will put forth some
argument like "love doesn't really exist, it's simply a series of
biochemical reactions",</a> I wonder at what kind of weird motivation he has in
denying the plainly obvious, or trying to language around a clearly evident
fact.
