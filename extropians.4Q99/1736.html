'What is your name?'  'Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.'  'IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR...'

<p>
<a href="1726.html#1736qlink1">&gt; The problem with Putnam's theory is that you can't get humans, capable</a><br>
<i>&gt; of *forming* models, without a pre-existing reality to create them.</i><br>

<p>
And?  Putnam would agree with that, he'd simply point out that we have
POSITED the existence of a real world with real people in it in order to
explain/predict our experiences.

<p>
With that having been said, I (as well as Putnam) believe that it is the
case that we have posited correctly, that is, there certainly IS a real
world, with real people in it, etc.  By that I mean that the above claims
are certainly all rationally acceptable under ideal epistemic conditions.

<p>
Putnam is NOT saying that there is no real world; that would be rationally
unacceptable, after all!  He is, however, saying that truth does not
consist in corresponding to the "real world," but in idealized rational
acceptability.

<p>
<a href="1726.html#1736qlink2">&gt; So internalism doesn't strike me as being very self-consistent.  In my</a><br>
<i>&gt; philosophy, which is called "Externalism" for a very good reason,</i><br>
<i>&gt; external reality predated humans, who evolved to model that reality.  </i><br>

<p>
Speaking as a self-affirmed internalist, your "externalism" seems like an
extremely reasonable model of the world; so reasonable, in fact, that I
ALSO believe that it is the case!

<p>
Your position in no way disagrees with Putnam's internalism.  Internalism
simply specifies the conditions under which externalism would turn out to
be true.

<p>
<a href="1726.html#1736qlink3">&gt; You can't "prove" reference, of course, because if that were true our</a><br>
<i>&gt; thoughts would define reality.  (And of course, I don't believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt; instantiation, especially of Turing-computable behaviors, but that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the point.)</i><br>

<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by this...  I don't recall any mention of this
particular snippet online.  What DO you mean by it?

<p>
<a href="1726.html#1736qlink4">&gt; To me, this sounds like another version of that old dilemna of "How do</a><br>
<i>&gt; you prove that rational thought works without assuming the rational</i><br>
<i>&gt; processes you use for the proof?"</i><br>

<p>
Not really, though that's certainly an interesting question.  I'll
probably go take a look at your TMOL page in a few minutes.
