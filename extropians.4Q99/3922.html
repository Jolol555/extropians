Thank you, Dan, for demonstrating that us zombies experience frustration
even though we cannot Experience it.  I have often suspected that one of
the goals of Zen is to breakthrough this internal shadow theater of
Experience so that one can experience the world more directly.  I want
to thank all who have joined in this discussion, which although it could
never have resolved anything (being about the q word, and all), has made
me realize that I am not conscious, and have never been, although I
thought I was.  This has freed me up from lots of useless (to a zombie)
conceptual baggage, and let me get on with trying to understand how
information processing systems (and other zombies) self organize,
represent external events and relationships, do problem solving, and get
out of bed in the morning.
