Good post about surveillance and tyranny, Charlie.  You may well have already 
encountered it before, but David Brin's book "The Transparent Society" does a 
good job of looking at the various issues raised by ubiquitous surveillance.  
Brin concludes that the technology will make a high degree of surveillance 
practically inevitable and that the only solution is to ensure as broad an 
access to the product of that surveillance as possible (thus the title of his 
book).  I think how different societies react to this challenge will be one 
of the prime determinants of liberty over the next 25 years.
