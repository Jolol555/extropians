Julian,

<p>
   Sorry, little confused about your post.  Although this subject developed 
from one which was about the gun issue, I would say that we are currently 
focused on the feasability of providing a nonlethal means of protection from 
violence.  Granted, this is related to the gun issue as a nonlethal weapon 
may prove a good alternative to firearms or have to be able to subdue an 
aggressor armed with guns, I would say it is applicable to all forms of 
threatened violence.  While I appreciate that many people are tired of the 
gun debate, the idea of providing nonlethal weapons for personal protection 
is one that I find important, and I have gotten a lot of good feedback from 
people here on the list, which I'm not sure I would have received elsewhere.  
If after further consideration, you still are unhappy with this subject, I 
would hope you could simply choose not to read those messages posted under 
this subject heading (though of course it would sadden me to lose your 
possible future participation should a point come up you might want to 
contribute to).

<p>
Thanks for your time,

<p>
Glen Finney
