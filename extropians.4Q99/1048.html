Abstract
<br>
  Flavonoids, a group of phenolic compounds found in fruits
  and vegetables, are known to have antioxidant properties. They prevent low
  density lipoprotein oxidation in vitro and thus may play a role in the
  prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). In 1986, in a prospective study
  of 34,492 postmenopausal women in Iowa, the authors examined the association
  of flavonoid intake with CHD and stroke
  mortality. Over 10 years of follow-up, 438 deaths from CHD and 131 deaths
  from stroke were documented. Total flavonoid
  intake was associated with a decreased risk of CHD death
  after adjusting for age and energy intake (p for trend =
  0.04). This association was attenuated after multivariate adjustment.
  However, decreased risk was seen in each category of intake
  compared with the lowest. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of CHD
  death from lowest to highest intake category were 1.0, 0.67
<br>
  (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.92), 0.56 (95% CI 0.39-0.79), 0.86 (95%<br>
  CI 0.63-1.18), and 0.62 (95% CI 0.44-0.87).There was no association between
  total flavonoid intake and stroke mortality
<br>
  (p for trend = 0.83). Of the foods that contributed the most to<br>
  flavonoid intake in this cohort, only
<br>
  broccoli was strongly associated with reduced risk of CHD death. The data of
  this study suggest that flavonoid intake
  may reduce risk of death from CHD in postmenopausal women.
