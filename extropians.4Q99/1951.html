Hello John,

<p>
I only included one quotation from my collection; here are the others
which exemplify your comments on "The Fall":

<p>
Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have
joy (11 Nephi 2:25).

<p>
Adam deliberately and wisely chose (to touch the forbidden
tree) and partook of the fruit (Talmage, DC, p. 65).

<p>
We ought to consider the fall of our first parents as one of the
great steps to external exaltation and happiness (Mormon
Catechism).

<p>
We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not
for Adam's transgression (AF, 2).

<p>
This is all summed-up in the expression of Bishop Tertullian:

<pre>
                            "Oh felix culpa!"

</pre>
