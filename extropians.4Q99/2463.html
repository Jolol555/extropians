<a name="2472qlink1">Sorry, I didn't phrase that right.  If selection is weaker due to complicated 
genetics,
<br>
the lifespan increase selection will be able to establish is shorter.  If you 
introduced
<br>
hypothetical improvements with simple genetics and no disadvantages, maybe
mice in the wild would end up with a lifespan of four years (I'm making up 
the numbers)
<br>
If the mutations had complicated genetics, maybe the best selection would be 
able
<br>
to do is 3 years.</a>

<p>
<a name="2472qlink2"><a href="2430.html#2463qlink3">&gt;&gt;Of course longer lifespan may have costs.  In the Rose lab, the long-lived</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;strains take longer to develop and lay fewer eggs in the first part of life.</i><br>
  
<p>
<a href="2430.html#2463qlink4">&gt;  So, shorter life cycle strains would outperform long-lived strains?</a><br>

<p>
With these particular strains.  Research has shown that some "short-lifespan" 
alleles
<br>
carry compensating advantages (for the genes, not necessarily the organism) 
while
<br>
others serve no purpose and have eluded selection.  Theory suggests (although 
I'm not
<br>
aware of any experimental tests) that genes with important and straightfoward 
"short-lifespan" effects essentially only come attached</a> to compensating 
benefits.

<p>
<a name="2472qlink3">The best area of "natural" effects to look at, by this theory, are 
short-lifespan alleles
<br>
which help the interests of the gene rather than the organism - mostly 
fertility 
<br>
and sexual selection genes.  It may well be possible to find genes that, say, 
increase
<br>
the growth of secretory breast or prostate cells.  Conking those genes will 
reduce
<br>
fertility (but we don't care much; we can deal with such problems) but 
they'll cut
<br>
your chance of breast or prostate cancer.  Since the genes are evolutionarily 
advantageous, they will exist even if easy to knock out and so be good targets
for medicine.</a>  

<p>
<a name="2472qlink4">We can also look at adaptations for our ancestral environement that are no 
longer
<br>
appropriate.  Genes for high LDL cholesterol and adult-onset diabetes seem to 
be
<br>
starvation defenses.  Those should also be amenable to intervention, with no 
cost
<br>
as long as we keep the supermarkets stocked.</a>

<p>
<a name="2472qlink5">Our best bet for the costless problems (whatever they are) is to look at 
things that
<br>
would be hard for evolution to do, so gene knockouts, drug alterations and 
simple
<br>
mutations are poor choices.  We would want to bring in novel systems, from 
design
<br>
or from other organisms.  An example (from Caleb Finch) would be whale 
anti-cancer
<br>
mechanisms.  Whales have a per-cell cancer chance that is orders of magnitude 
less
<br>
than yours.  Presumably they have at least one additional layer of defense.  
If we
<br>
could figure out what it was, we could take out a stem cell type, splice in 
the cancer
<br>
defense, wipe out the cells in the body, and then insert the "improved" 
cells.  Voila,
<br>
90% reduction in leukemia.  If we're really lucky, we might be able to 
improve cell
<br>
senescence at the same time.
