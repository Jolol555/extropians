Perhaps so. Can you relate a few of the traditional questions addressed by the
humanities which science does not (or can not) also address (besides the
singular issue of moralism, which I think avoids the hard questions)?</a>

ought to do." We just disagree (sometimes) about how to do</a> it.

As I see it, science can achieve success in social policy</a> making ("political
<a name="2151qlink5">science"? Not!) equivalent to what it has achieved in chemistry</a> or astronomy. As
<a name="2151qlink6">neuroscience reveals more about how human brains function, we can</a> learn more
<a name="2151qlink7">about what we ought to do to extend and amplify our sentience. One thing I
advocate that we do involves further debunking of "Cultural Studies" and other
pseudo-science nonsense.</a>
