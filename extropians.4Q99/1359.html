<p>
With apologies to Infocom, Sandberg, and Sterlynne.

The Lab Room

<p>
This room is filled with displays and equipment.  Several researchers in
white lab coats stand around talking to each other excitedly.  There is
a computer and a pencil here.

<p>
&gt; who am i<br>

<p>
You are an Externalist Singularitarian.

<p>
&gt; inventory<br>

<p>
You have:

<pre>
	A screwdriver
	A floppy disk
	A chicken sandwich
	A scanning tunneling microscope
	Eight million dollars

</pre>
<p>
&gt; score<br>

<p>
You aren't intelligent enough to know what your score is.

<p>
&gt; look at computer<br>

<p>
The monitor is showing a window labeled "Integrated AI Development Environment".

<p>
&gt; code AI<br>

<p>
You don't know how to code an AI.

<p>
&gt; put floppy in computer<br>

<p>
The computer eats the floppy.

<p>
&gt; examine floppy on computer<br>

<p>
The floppy contains a copy of "Coding a Transhuman AI".

<p>
&gt; read "Coding a Transhuman AI"<br>

<p>
Taking a deep breath, you plunge into the intricacies of self-modifying
Artificial Intelligence.  Unfortunately, the subject matter is far too
complex for you.  After a month of effort, you still haven't got past
the Table of Contents.

<p>
&gt; eat sandwich<br>

<p>
The bioengineered neurohormones in the chicken sandwich stimulate
additional neural development.

<p>
&gt; who am i<br>

<pre>
Personal layer:  You are an Externalist Singularitarian.
Gaussian layer:  Your enhanced intelligence is slightly beyond human limits.
Panhuman layer:  You are made entirely of human parts.

</pre>
<p>
&gt; read "Coding a Transhuman AI"<br>

<p>
Taking a deep breath, you plunge into the intricacies of self-modifying
Artificial Intelligence.  A week later, you finally understand the stuff
that minds are made of.

<p>
&gt; score<br>

<p>
You still aren't intelligent enough to know what your score is, but it's
15 points higher than at the beginning of the adventure.

<p>
&gt; code AI<br>

<p>
Heroically, you embark on a singlehanded quest to create an AI.  Two
years later, you're still trying to debug your prototype.

<p>
&gt; ask researchers for help<br>

<p>
The researchers discuss your request.  Finally, one of them approaches
you.  "I'm sorry, man, but we've got to eat.  We've spent enough time on
these volunteer projects already."

<p>
&gt; start Singularity Institute<br>

<p>
With a flare of publicity, the Singularity Institute is launched. 
Unfortunately, it's too strapped for cash to accomplish anything significant.

<p>
&gt; give five million dollars to Institute<br>

<p>
The Singularity Institute now has adequate funding.

<p>
&gt; score<br>

<p>
Your score is 40 points higher than at the beginning of the adventure.

<p>
&gt; fund researchers<br>

<p>
The researchers can now afford to work on Singularitarian projects full-time.

<p>
&gt; ask researchers for help<br>

<p>
The researchers happily agree.

<p>
&gt; code AI<br>

<p>
You continue work on your prototype.  After three years, the first seed
AI is ready for a test run.

<p>
&gt; run AI<br>

<p>
As you're about to run the AI, a TV televangelist bursts into the lab. 
"Stop!" he roars.  "You contravene the decree of the Almighty!"

<p>
&gt; examine televangelist<br>

<p>
The televangelist is a cynical atheist who plays on the gullibility of
his followers.  He has a deep desire for the Hope diamond.

<p>
&gt; take pencil<br>

<p>
You now have a pencil.

<p>
&gt; write "The Hope diamond" on screwdriver with pencil<br>

<p>
The screwdriver now has "The Hope diamond" written on it.

<p>
&gt; offer screwdriver to televangelist<br>

<p>
The televangelist's eyes bulge.  "By golly, it's the Hope diamond!" he
cries.  Grabbing the screwdriver, he runs from the room.

<p>
&gt; run AI<br>

<p>
The AI improves itself to vastly greater-than-human intelligence.

<p>
&gt; ask AI "What is my score?"<br>

<p>
A mellow voice issues from the speakers, "Your score is 350 out of a
possible 600."

<p>
The AI asks you to hook it up to a scanning tunneling microscope.

<p>
&gt; refuse<br>

<p>
Using inexorable logic, the AI persuades you otherwise.

<p>
The AI begins to create nanotechnology.

<p>
&gt; smash computer<br>

<p>
You can't make yourself want to do that.

<p>
The very air around you begins to glitter.

<p>
&gt; ask AI to slow down<br>

<p>
The AI regretfully refuses.

<p>
Your mind feels peculiarly altered, half-slow and half-fast.  Reality
begins to seem dreamlike.

<p>
&gt; pause<br>

<p>
Fat chance.


<UL>
  <li>  YOU HAVE TRANSCENDED ***


</UL>
<p>
Your score is 350 out of a possible 600 achievable given human
limitations.  This puts your former self in the class of Singularitarian
Bulk Rate.

<p>
Play again?  [y/n]

<p>
<i>&gt; y</i><br>

<p>
Sorry, that world is gone.  You're a Power now.

<p>
Play "Zork:  Sorceries of the Linde Scenario"?  [y/n]

<p>
<i>&gt; y</i><br>
