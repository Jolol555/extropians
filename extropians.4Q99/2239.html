This is only true in the opening phase of the arms race, when human
civilization looks is spread across the surface of the planet and you your
ability to replace people with hardware is severely limited.  Things get a
lot worse after that point.

<p>
As nanotech and AI become more advanced the military forces of a nation
become more and more resistant to both nuclear attacks and indiscriminate
green goo.  They can build deeply buried manufacturing facilities, build
combat robots with heavy radiation shielding and robust nanotech immune
systems, and move all military personnel into armored bunkers.  As the
bunkers get deeper and the robots get tougher most world powers will respond
by building bigger nukes, more virulent goo, and more and more sophisticated
robotic armies.

<p>
<a name="2249qlink1">There are several unfortunate trends here.  The first is that the
survivability of military forces tends to increase over time, because
burying yourself under a mountain is easier than moving one.  As a result
the chance of nuclear weapons being used actually increases, which is a
shame because the environment and civilian population on the surface are
still very fragile targets.</a>  There is also a strong incentive to build very
large robotic armies, because a) you can't destroy one with cheap weapons of
mass destruction, and b) other things being equal, big armies tend to beat
smaller ones.  I don't see the incentives changing until someone invents a
new super weapon capable of physically disrupting the entire volume of a
planet, or until all of the Earth's mass has been converted into an optimal
mix of shielding, weapons and industry.

<p>
Now, I would hope that we'll see a significant migration into space long
before then.  Spreading across the solar system would help because it would
make it much easier to defend a civilian population, since any attacking
force must cross a large amount of open space where it can be detected with
relative ease.  Interstellar colonization would be even better, because it
would make the time required to launch an attack comparable to the time
required to build a navy capable of stopping it.

<p>
Mind you, all of this only applies to civilizations that are not yet doing
mega-scale engineering.  Once you start remodeling entire solar systems the
whole dynamic would change yet again, and I'm not sure what the result would
be.
