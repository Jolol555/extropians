(Note #1: The exceptionally high arginine content of coconut protein
<p>
          may partly explain the absence of heart disease.
Note #2: The exceptionally high satiating effect of tubers may
<p>
         help account for the absence of obesity.)

  Age relations of cardiovascular risk factors in a traditional Melanesian

Abstract
<br>
  This study examined cross-sectional age relations of blood pressure,
  anthropometric indexes, serum lipids, and hemostatic variables in 203
  subsistence horticulturists aged 20-86 y in Kitava,
  Trobriand Islands, Papua New Guinea. The population is characterized by
<a name="3366qlink1">  extreme leanness (despite food abundance), low blood pressure, low plasma
  plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity, and rarity of cardiovascular
  disease. Tubers, fruit, fish, and coconut are dietary staples whereas dairy
  products, refined fat and sugar, cereals, and alcohol are absent and salt
  intake is low. Although diastolic blood pressure was not associated with age
  in Kitavans, systolic blood pressure increased linearly
  after 50 y of age in both sexes. Body mass index decreased with age in both
  sexes. Serum total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, low-density-lipoprotein
  cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B increased in males between 20 and 50 y of
  age, whereas high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I
  decreased. There were no significant differences in these indexes with age in
  the few females studied. A slight linear age-related increase of
  lipoprotein(a) was present in males. Plasma fibrinogen, factor VII clotting
  activity, factor VIII clotting activity, and von Willebrand factor antigen
  increased with age in both sexes but plasminogen activator inhibitor 1
  activity did not. The modest or absent relations between the indexes measured
  and age are apparently important explanations of the virtual nonexistence of
  stroke and ischemic heart disease in Kitava.

Abstract
<br>
  We cross-sectionally measured plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
  activity, fibrinogen, factor VII (FVII:C) and VIII (FVIII:C) coagulant
  activity, and von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) in 162 traditional
  horticulturalists older than 40 years from the tropical island of
  Kitava, Papua New Guinea, where the intake of western food
  is negligible and where stroke and ischaemic heart disease appear to be
  absent. Identical analyses were made in Swedish subjects of comparable ages.
  Kitavams had markedly lower PAI-1 activity, with 85% of
  males and 100% of females having PAI-1 activity &lt; or = 5 U/ml, as compared
  with 22 and 14% in Swedish males and females (p &lt; 0.0001). Surprisingly,
  Kitavans also had higher FVII:C. FVIII:C and VWF:Ag.
  Fibrinogen was 10% lower in Kitavan males while 25% higher
  in Kitavan females. The very low PAI-1 activity in
  Kitavans may explain some of their apparent freedom from
  cardiovascular disease and probably relates to their extreme leanness.

  Lipoprotein composition and serum cholesterol ester fatty acids in
  nonwesternized Melanesians.

Abstract
<br>
  In this study, the relationships between dietary fat [as measured by serum
  cholesterol ester fatty acids (CE-FA)], age, smoking, body mass index, and
  serum lipids were analyzed in 151 subsistence horticulturalists, aged 20-86
  yr, from Kitava, Trobriand Islands, Papua New Guinea. Their
  diet consists of tubers, fruit, coconut, fish, and vegetables with a
  negligible influence of western food and alcohol. Total fat intake is low
  [21% of energy (en%)], while saturated fat intake from coconuts is high (17
  en%, mainly lauric and myristic acid). In multivariate analysis, 11-43% of
  the variation of the serum lipoprotein composition was explained by CE-FA,
  age, and smoking habits. The proportion of CE20:5n-3 explained much of the
  variation of triglycerides (TG, negative relation) and high density
  lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C, positive) in both sexes and serum
  apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1, positive) in the males. CE16:0 was positively
  related to TG and negatively related to HDL-C and ApoA1 in both sexes, and in
  males it related negatively to total cholesterol (TC) and low density
  lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). In males, negative relationships were
  present between CE18:2n-6 and TC and between CE14:0 and serum lipoprotein(a).
  Smoking was independently associated with lower ApoA1 in both sexes and with
</a>  lower HDL-C and higher TG, TC, LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B in males. In
  conclusion, marine n-3 fatty acids and linoleic acid showed the same
  potentially beneficial relationships with lipoproteins and apolipoproteins as
  in western populations. The relations of palmitic acid to serum lipids may be
  explained in terms of endogenous fat synthesis at a low-fat intake, rather
  than reflecting its relative intake.

  Apparent absence of stroke and ischaemic heart disease in a traditional

Abstract
<br>
  On the island of Kitava, Trobriand Islands, Papua New
  Guinea, a subsistence lifestyle, uninfluenced by western dietary habits, is
  still maintained. Tubers, fruit, fish and coconut are dietary staples. Of the
  total population, 1816 subjects were estimated to be older than 3 years and
  125 to be 60-96 years old. The frequencies of spontaneous sudden death,
  exertion-related chest pain, hemiparesis, aphasia and sudden imbalance were
  assessed by semi-structured interviews in 213 adults aged 20-96. Resting
  electrocardiograms (ECG's) were recorded in 119 males and 52 females. No case
  corresponding to stroke, sudden death or angina pectoris was described by the
  interviewed subjects. Minnesota Code (MC) items 1-5 occurred in 14 ECG's with
  no significant relation to age, gender or smoking. ST items (MC 4.2 and 4.3)
  were found in two females and Q items (MC 1.1.2, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3) in three
  males. Stroke and ischaemic heart disease appear to be absent in this
  population.
