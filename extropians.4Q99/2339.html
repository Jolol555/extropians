Actually, you don't even need atomicity.</a>  I would divide things as follows:


<OL>
  <li>  The way things are (objective reality);
  <li>  The way things should be (objective morality);
  <li>  The way we currently want things to be (objective reality, part of 1);
  <li>  The way we should want things to be (objective morality, converges
to wanting 2)
  <li>  Our current model of the way we should want things to be (model,
converges to 4)


</OL>
<p>
If 5 (your model of 4) conflicts with your model of 3, then you don't
want to want what you want.

<p>
<a name="2359qlink1">Or in much simpler terms, and leaving out the objective morality:  If
you *want* something, then you want a part of the Universe to change. 
Well, what you want is also a part of the Universe, and you can want to
change what you want.
