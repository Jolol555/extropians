<p>
Having now been subscribed the Mars Society's "Law and Governance" mail list 
for a few months, I can predict a couple of things about the reception of 
your talk.<a name="3160qlink1">  First, most of the folks in the audience will be astonishingly 
ignorant of nanotech, so you'll be doing good work in introducing the basic 
concept.  However, you should assume that you are starting from "square one" 
and that most of your audience will still be digesting the basic concept of 
an assembler when you're off and running about nanomedicine.</a>

<a name="3389qlink1"><a name="3160qlink2">Second, talk of dismantling Mars will turn that group against</a> you: Expect the 
<a name="3160qlink3">"peasants storming Frankenstein's castle" reaction.</a>  The Mars Society is 
HEAVILY influenced by Kim Stanley Robinson's books (they are considered as a 
kind of scripture among the group's founders and activists) and there is a 
lot of "Martian Spirituality" talk amongst this crowd.<a name="3158qlink1">  I know it's hard for 
you, Robert :-), but PLEASE go easy with those folks</a>â€¦
