<a href="0687.html#0716qlink1">&gt;We try to get the government out of the funding business as much as </a><br>
<i>&gt;possible and instead promote special interest organizations that we can </i><br>
<i>&gt;freely choose to donate our money to.</i><br>

<p>
I'm all for you here.  That was the point I was trying to make a few days 
ago.  No taxes, except maybe for a military.  You can donate money to 
whatever cause you believe in.  The money you ask, "where does it come 
from?", will come from those interest organizations you speak of.

<p>
As for eye for and eye, I disagree with this as well.  I missed it the first 
time I read the post.  But everything else he said is right on.
I don't have time to commit fully on those but I'll do my best to later.
