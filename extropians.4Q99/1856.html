<i>&gt;  the quemes are correlations/consistencies in the world around us? They</i><br>

<p>
    quemes = emes? not long after i read _the selfish gene_, i starting 
thinking that memes and genes were subsets of 'emes' in general, where an eme 
was any pattern of cause and effect that spread across and ran on multiple 
substrates. so, pool balls being hit could be viewed as emetic substrates of 
a sort, with momentum being the eme... i guess my beef with this viewpoint is 
that its waaaaay to general, so it probably doesnt help much if your</a> looking 
for explanative/predictive functionality. however, with refinement it might 
become something useful...
