  That's a very big issue and I subscribe to the Randian/Objectivist view --
  viz., coercion is basically violation of an individual's rights.  Inside
  that view, the only organisms which possess rights are those with a rational
  (volitional) mind.  (See Rand and Branden's _The Virtue of Selfishness_,
  which is a very brief book -- about 150 pages -- for more on this.)  If you
<a name="3291qlink4"><a name="3195qlink4"><a name="3194qlink4">  agree with this, then it would appear octopodes have no rights.&gt;&gt;

they understand about what they are doing, and how different is their

judgement.

<p>
  &lt;&lt;In this context, does this mean that we can do as we wish with them?  (I'm
  qualifying with "in this context" because there might be a better view on
  this issue.  I'm just trying to stick in this one since it seems to be the
  best I know of.)  That's another matter all together.  Just because
  something doesn't have rights does not, to me, seem to justify any action to
  it.  E.g., though I don't think cats have rights, I do not think it is right
<a name="3291qlink11"><a name="3195qlink11"><a name="3194qlink11">  to go around torturing them.&gt;&gt;

<p>
I think that things begin to accrue moral rights when they begin to care
about things.  I am still trying to work out where to draw the line</a> on that.

<a name="3291qlink12"><a name="3195qlink12"><a name="3194qlink12">For example, does a trophism count as "caring"; how about a withdrawal
reflex?  I think that the ability to care about what you care about is the
highest form of life.  This ability to engage in reflective caring is
probably the most important type of caring.</a></a></a>

<a href="3054.html#3078qlink2">&lt;&lt; That said, uplifting does not seem to be a form of torture.  The goal is</a><br>
not
<br>
  pain or sadistic pleasure.  It's not even exploitation -- unless one
  considers having another intelligent species around a form of exploitation.&gt;&gt;

<a name="3291qlink14"><a name="3195qlink14"><a name="3194qlink14">This is true.  It would seem to us that uplifting would be an absolute
benefit to the species in question.  But would that species think so?</a></a></a>
