<p>
Yes, it stands to reason that the group would tend to dilute any mutation
occurring as a result of individual selection. Groups tend to assimilate and
disperse any freak genetically induced traits (at least those which don't result
in infertility).<a name="2475qlink7"> Could shorter life spans, which would increase the frequency of
such occurrences, accelerate the Evolution of the entire group? --J. R.
