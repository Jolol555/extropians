<i> &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; I assert that it is completely impossible for you to flip a coin 1 million</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; times and have it turn up heads every time.  When I say completely</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; impossible, I mean that it will never EVER happen, no matter how many</i><br>

<i> &gt; You're being very sloppy with your language and your thinking here.</i><br>

Well, which is it?  You seem confused.  First you shout out that I
CAN PROVE IT.  (Pretty sure of yourself.)  Then you say, a little
quieter, "I can't PROVE the laws of probability..."  I think that
hissing sound is your argument deflating.  You say you've mastered the
laws of probability.  That's nice.  How do we know they're real laws,
not just some idea which has worked out for you?

<p>
<a href="1358.html#1413qlink2"> &gt; opportunity I will do so again, _until something better comes along_.</a><br>
<i> &gt; Your million-coin-flip bet is a cop out; you know it isn't physically</i><br>
<i> &gt; possible to test your theory within your lifetime, so you're safe.  If</i><br>
<i> &gt; you had any balls, you'd offer a bet that's feasible.  I offer this</i><br>
<i> &gt; one to any takers: flip an unmodified US dime 10 times.  If it lands</i><br>
<i> &gt; head-up all 10 times, I'll give you $100, otherwise I'll keep the dime.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; This in no way means I have unlimited unshakable faith in the laws</i><br>
<i> &gt; of probability.  It just means I'm willing to bet $100 on them</i><br>
<i> &gt; (because I know that on average, I make 0.24 cents every time I take</i><br>
<i> &gt; this bet).</i><br>

<p>
Actually, this is not how most professional gamblers appraise a
positive expected value (e.v.) situation.  You're supposed to measure
your risk aversion (you should have some if you have finite money,
since you don't want to be wiped out) and use it to discount the value
of a particular e.v. further, to get a certainty equivalent (c.e.) in
dollars of the e.v. in dollars.  A standard technique is to compute
your "kelly" factor, which may be correlated to how much more likely
you want to make it that you double your stake before you would ever
see it drop by 50%.
