After Gina's reply to my request, I certainly intend to read this
publication henceforth.

<p>
My comment about "Borg Barbie..." was meant as self-criticism,
i.e. to point to a mindless avoidance on my part.  Larry Klaes
forwards "Nanogirl News" to many of my lists, and my motivation
for writing was the growing realization, emphasized by the very
complimentary remarks I read about Gina, that I needed to
master my prejudice and include this publication in my regular
study.

<p>
Thank you for your admonition; it was appropriate,

<p>
Bob
