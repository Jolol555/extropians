This holiday season, if you've done well this year with your salary, stock 
options, or portfolio appreciation, you might be in a mood to give to help 
others. This is not giving out of guilt or pity but, to put it in 
Nietzchean terms, an overflowing of power. I'd call this generosity and 
benevolence rather than charity.

<p>
<a name="3615qlink1">But how to give without encouraging depending and rewarding slothfulness? 
As a frequent visitor to the Motley Fool web site, I checked out their 
group charity drive and liked the look of the Grameen Foundation. Their 
method is to make microloans to assist poor people in starting businesses 
that will support them indefinitely. They claim a 97% payback rate (partly 
achieved through group pressure--all recipients in a group must pull 
through for any to continue receiving microloans).</a>

<p>
As Extropians, I think most of us recognize that, while pursuing our own 
interests is laudable, *effectively* helping others not only expresses 
benevolence, but also helps people to pull themselves out of poverty and 
contribute to the economy--which ends up being to our benefit too.

<p>
If you are a registered Motley Fool, you might given through their group

Onward!
