<a name="2071qlink1"><a name="2062qlink1">Well, I got a response from one of the authors of the
"Evil Transhumanism" page...</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2083qlink1"><i>&gt; I was under the impression that this web page would not be found on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; huge world wide</a> web.  Well, I guess you would like to know how</i><br>
<i>&gt; this page came about and where in the world we came up with our</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas. I joined a group of people in an English class my freshman year in</i><br>
<i>&gt; college to build a web page as a final project. We could not decide what to</i><br>
<i>&gt; build a web page about for a while, but we decided to do one about cryonics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our teacher had us broaden the topic to transhumanism and in about two weeks</i><br>
<i>&gt; we created this page. For the most part, none of us really know anything</i><br>
<a name="2062qlink2">&gt; about transhumanism, cryonics, etc., and the only reason that we argued<br>
&gt; against it is because we thought that that would be easier.</a><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; ... the only reason that it is still up is because I honestly don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; how to remove it. I truly hope that the things expressed in the page did</i><br>
<i>&gt; not offend you because it's just a lot of BS and it doesn't even reflect</i><br>
&gt; my or the other group members feelings towards the subject. ...<br>
&gt; I will work on taking it down.<br>

<p>
<a name="2132qlink1"><a name="2077qlink1">So, a lynch mob by the textropians (they still do those types of things
down there I guess, don't they...)</a> is probably not in order.  I even
invited the responsible party to make it to the next Extro conference.
