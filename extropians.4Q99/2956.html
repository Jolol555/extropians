I doubt it.

<p>
It may be hormone trigger based.  You don't need to distinguish
males from females until you can reproduce.  On the other hand you
need to be able to detect bad foods your entire life.

Evidence for homone-based trigger mechanisms perhaps.

<p>
No, the studies are fairly clear about this, men are "programmed" to
be (visually) attracted to high (bust-or-hip / waist) ratios, presumably
because easier births and/or greater milk capacity are markers for
reproductive success.  We probably aren't attracted to the inverse
bacause these women would be "pregnant" and would therefore be
poor choices for attempting reproduction.  I expect there will
be some variation in the strength of these attractions and/or
some "spin" put on them by cultural influences.

<a href="2894.html#2956qlink5">&gt; Memes like 'men shall not lie with men' have historically made sense</a><br>
<i>&gt; from a public health point of view - in just the same way memes for</i><br>
<i>&gt; monogamy did.</i><br>

<p>
Huh?  Actually men lying with men has a fairly long historical tradition
(the Greek armies come to mind).  Public health really took a hit
when large numbers of women followed the armies around and promoted
the spread of STDs.  This is because it is generally easier for men
to tell they are infected with something than women, so women
can function as hidden carriers.  This probably was at its worst
during the middle ages up to Napoleon's time when large numbers of 
recruits &amp; camp followers were infected with syphillus.

<p>
Actually, the mouth is a much greater carrier of bacteria than
other body areas.  By this argument we would have social or
genetic selection against kissing.  I suspect the social benefits
of kissing weigh heavily against this.

<p>
<a href="2894.html#2956qlink7">&gt; I see an analogy to injunctions against pork. I'm certain the</a><br>
<i>&gt; incidence of homosexuality would be dramatically higher than ~10% in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; society where there wasn't such a stigma attached, Ancient Greece</i><br>
<i>&gt; being the canonical example.</i><br>

<p>
I could see interesting anti-pork injunctions developing because
swine are a carrier of influenza viruses and intermixing of
swine/avian/human influenza viruses is what makes the really
nasty strains (influenza is one of the few viruses that can
be viewed as having multiple "chromosomes", so strain intermixing
in animals/humans infected with multiple types can produce some
really nasty variants).

<p>
The reason for higher levels of sexual activity (when social reasons
against it are lessened) is because of the genetic "hypersexuality"
program.  Humans are programmed to have sex for pleasure, not to have
sex for reproduction.  It is interesting to think that much of
the anti-homosexual bias seems to go hand-in-hand with Christianity.
Perhaps a clever ploy on the part of the church to outlaw "outlets"
for sexual drives, increasing their control over the accepted "outlets"
(e.g. marriages) and strengthening their birth-to-death management
of private lives.
