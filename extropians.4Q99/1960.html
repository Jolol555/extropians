Well stated. Your point regarding about (I'm paraphrasing) rekigious/social 
leaders using religion as a means of societal control are historically 
accurate. My contention is that not every inter-action between religion and 
science is not a re-do of the Scopes trial or even poor Galileo.  At every 
AAAS conference there is a lecture given to science and religion, focusing on 
dialogue.  Although religion (Christianity) of the 19th and the 
Fundamentalists of the 20th century have played the zero-sum game; there's no 
causal reason why this must ever be so.  

<p>
<a name="1984qlink1">Don't be surprised with every scientific discovery achieved, that it gets 
utilized by the religious, I mean, why not?  Religion as practiced by the 
non-fundamentalist is a form of social inter-action, and also an "opiate" to 
quote Marx.</a>  When life is painful, painkillers are frequently the treatment 
of choice, while the underlying cause of the pain is tackled.

Interestingly enough, if one reads magazines such as Skeptic and Skeptical 
Inquirer; they only thing the readers of that magazine have in common with 
most of this list's members is Atheism or Agnosticism. They generally have 
dumped on such demonstrated concepts as nanotechnology; join Scientific 
American (1997) magazine in terming it a "Cargo Cult" up there with cold 
fusion and zero point energy devices.  

<p>
Not everyone who dares to hope, even for a God, is a book-burner; a disuader 
of searching for answers, or a hypocrite.  Such people may be mis-guided in 
that hope, but its their right. Just as it is your right to say 'its all 
bullshit,  &lt;God&gt; gets in my way, I don't wanna hear any lies'.  Fair enough.
