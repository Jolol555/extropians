<p>
The question has been asked--what made me think that neoluddites were involved
in the WTO protests in Seattle?  

<p>
It is true that many different protests converged in one place, and that
gets confusing.  A review of the recent coverage reveals that many of the
organizers involved are connected to groups who organized the protests
against genetically-altered foodstuffs in Europe.  In particular Jose
Beauvei (sorry, dont' know the spelling), who led a group that demolished a
McDonalds in protest of hormonally enhanced beef imported from America.  

<p>
<a name="2865qlink1">Social justice, free trade and labor concerns form the basis of many
objections to emergent technologies, and coalitions are being formed</a> on
that basis.

<p>
Take care,
<br>
