<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>

<p>
To Which I replied...
<br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<a href="3179.html#3182qlink2">&gt;  &gt; It's kinda hard to tell if it will work or not....I know of no example </a><br>
<i>&gt; where</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; it's been tried.  What has been called free was in reality just less</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; regulated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>

<p>
To which rowen@technologist  replied...

<p>
<a href="3179.html#3182qlink3">&gt;  There is an interesting paper on this, CAPITALISM: A TREATISE ON</a><br>
<i>&gt;  ECONOMICS by George Reisman.  Permit me to quote a bit from it:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
&lt;snip large portion of quote with which i mostly agree&gt;

<p>
<a href="3179.html#3182qlink4">&gt;  The freedom of production in the United States led to an unprecedented</a><br>
<i>&gt;  outpouring of innovationsâ€”to the steady introduction of new and pre-</i><br>
<i>&gt;  viously unheard of products and to the constant improvement of methods</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of production. This, along with the constant availability of an adequate</i><br>
<i>&gt;  supply of savings to implement the advances, produced the most</a> rapid</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and sustained rate of economic progress in the history of the world. [39]"</i><br>

<p>
Now isn't this a contradiction?  It seems that a free market DOES produce 
innovations. 

<p>
I contend that it does.  I also contend that the degree of freedom of the 
market and the quantity of 
<br>
Innovations are directly proportional.  Agreed that the eara (pre income tax) 
that you
<br>
reference is less restrictive than now...but it was not a true 'free 
market'.....there were 
<br>
still taxes and regulations....(the whiskey rebellion comes to mind).....just 
not as stifleing 
<br>
as currently exist..

<p>
Furthermore it is quoted.
<br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<br>
the failure rate of small businesses due to the
<br>
<a href="3179.html#3182qlink5">&gt;  devastating purchasing power of corporations is a grievous limitation of</a><br>
<i>&gt;  "free enterprise".</i><br>


<p>
This could be....but corporations are a creature of the government's tax 
policy. ( Just as the Mafia is a 
<br>
creature of the government's implementation of Prohibition...and Drug Cartels 
are a creature of
<br>
the "war on drugs"  )  In my opinion it follows that in a free market 
corporations would have less of an 
<br>
advantage than they currently do and small business would be in a more 
competitive position.


<p>
You further state.

<p>
<a href="3179.html#3182qlink6">&gt;  Please understand that I am a critic of Capitalism because of its inherent</a><br>
<i>&gt;  contradictions and its distributive tendencies with respect to wealth.</i><br>

<p>
The contradictions are not evident to me.  As I illustrated...these supposed 
contradictions are the 
<br>
result of non free market forces...that is...created by the government..
