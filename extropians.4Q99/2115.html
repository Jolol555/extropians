Ja, I was thinking the same thing.  Even running far far away probably
wont help much because nanobots travel much better than we do.  If the
earth gets grey gooed, its only a matter of time before all the rocky
planets catch it too, from meteors striking the earth and kicking up
a tiny amount of goo into interstellar orbit.

<p>
And of course, if nanotech capable humans start using nanotech to
carry colonies, the infection spreads even more rapidly.  And even
if some humans manage to escape earth ahead of nanotech, the
knowledge in their collective minds that nanotech is possible means
it is only a matter of time before they invent it on board and suffer
the same fate as earth.

<p>
Let us work like hell to make nanotech our friend and keep it
under control somehow.

<p>
Antisingularitarianistically speaking, the same problem applies to
that technology too, eh Eliezer?  It *will* be able to find us.  spike
