<p>
This is simply a brief statement to say that I have personally no feelings
against Natasha, and that any comments I have made have stemmed from a sense
that the level of respect I feel towards her has not been returned in kind.
Whether that emotional response is correct or not, I do not yet know, but
I hope that it was wrong.  If it was wrong, I am prepared to make an
apology for it.

<p>
Persons who have written to me in private email--please consider this my
response to your messages.
