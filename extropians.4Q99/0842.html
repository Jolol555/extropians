<a href="0806.html#0842qlink1">&gt;&gt;Much or all of what we perceive as transhumanism has in a way</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;simply been a part of the history of science and technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Could be, but I'm not so sure. What we perceive as transhumanists is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding and knowledge of science and technology.  Our psychological</i><br>
<i>&gt;makeup plays a primary part in our desire to learn and our ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt;accept changes which affects our transhumanism.  where science and</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology play a principal part is in the evolution of transhumans.</i><br>

<p>
People certainly can hold different attitudes and interests with regard to
science and technology and their development.  I was just trying to get at
the notion that we have seen constant progress in science and technology
and that the transhumanist interests are something of a logical extension
of what has come before.

<a href="0806.html#0842qlink2">&gt;Robert's response was on target to us both, but I can't find it because</a><br>
<i>&gt;you changed the Subject line.</i><br>

<p>
The subject line of your post was "Re: Extropianism certainly does have a
history already!" (sent 09 October).
