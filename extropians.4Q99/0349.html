No need to be formal, Bryan, we're all pals here. But if the impulse to
formality overwhelms you, that's Dr Broderick.</a>

I'd rather leave `God' out of it, as well as `meat'.</a>

<p>
More to the point: I believe you've missed the force of my objection to
this usage. I'm not calling for *euphemism*, as in some mealy-mouthed
demand that the limbless be called `differently athletic'. Referring to
living human persons as `meat' is not an obvious, neutral lexical default
choice - it's a deliberately affrontive declaration, conveying an attitude
well captured in Machine's rather Manichean avowal (on the &gt;H list) that he
or she (it?) uses `the term "meat" all the time particularly because it is
derisive.  i do hold<a name="0358qlink1"> flesh in contempt.'

<p>
I don't. Most people don't. It's pissing in the wind to convey this
impression inadvertently (unless of course you agree with Machine and
actually do `hold the flesh in contempt', a position I regard as either
</a>
adolescent angst/posturing or, ahem, close to psychotic). You might as well
routinely refer to our bodies as `shit-containers',<a name="0358qlink2"> which is also true in a
limited degree. Avoiding such narrow and arguably deformed
characteristations isn't `euphemism', it's being adult, as well as showing
sensitivity to the opinions of those we wish to persuade of an enhanced,
not constricted, view of personhood as science starts to rewrite humanity
</a>
into transhumanity and then posthumanity. IMO.
