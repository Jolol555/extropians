<p>
 I'm fairly confident that an independant Intel would be beaten if it
priced chips as if it had a full monopoly, and I suspect this competitive
pressure has an effect on prices that is comparable to the benefits of a
merger.

<br>
 With Microsoft, I'm not convinced a model that looks only at prices captures
the biggest efficiency differences. The amount of competition probably
has a significant effect on OS quality by altering the behavior of Microsoft
employees in ways that accountants can't measure. The quality differences
between OSs are more important to me than the price differences.

<p>
 Ok. If I thought they were acting as if there was negligible competition,
I would agree with your conclusions.
