<i>&gt; Very refreshing, if I am interpreting it right.  The moral is that we should</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; with regard to predicted human vs machine wars, we automatically side</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the humans, without asking which group is more deserving morally.</i><br>
<i>&gt; We need to start thinking in broader terms and not identifying so closely</i><br>
<i>&gt; with our genetics and metabolism.</i><br>

They would not be our species, but predominately mechanized humans might be homo
mecha.  What are the next post-sapiens, and how are they described?

<p>
An artifical intelligence, with the capacity to be called life, would be a new
species, I guess its own phylum or whatnot.  I search to see Kingdom, Phylum, Class,
Order, Family, Genus, Species.

<p>
Philogeny or phylogeny is an interesting subject of which I know not so much.  Where
taxonomy is classification, philogeny is the study of evolution.

<p>
In those kinds of terms, the comparative advantages of a synthetic basis are
several, as well, of course, comparative disadvantages.  The first advantage that
comes to mind is computational speed, but that is certainly tempered by the utter
inadequacy of a conventional computer to emulate a brain.

<p>
It would not be surprising that some of the most advanced mecha would be organic.

<p>
You mention human chauvinism, in the very long term I think such attitudes are
beneficial for the species.  Our most ancient rituals are of birth, love, and death,
these are the seeds of art.  Xenophobia is not necessarily good, but it is not
necessarily bad, in some sense it is a preservatory imperative.  Xena is good.

<p>
I have not read the article, and find its premise amusing.

<p>
Even if/when people are technologically and spiritually capable to fully transcend
the flesh, I'm sure many would still choose to journey within it.  There would be a
large amount of time to do so.
