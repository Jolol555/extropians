obtaining the most successful decisions. Cutting politics ("A strife of

for private advantage." --Bierce) out of the loop, would meet with the strongest
resistance from powerful politicians (whom the scientific method would also
prune from the decision making system).

In this scenario, neither you nor I would decide which color to paint the
building. We'd both agree to let the expert system decide.
Eventually, we'd let the SI make all these kinds of decisions. (Didn't we have
this conversation once before?)</a>
