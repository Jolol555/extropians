I've always thought reincarnation was an incoherent idea. Even if it were
true that when Napolean died, something in him drifted around for a few
hundred years until finding its way into my body, that thing is surely not
<br>
"me", nor is it Napolean, and it would make little sense to say "I was<br>
Napolean in a past life", seeing as this mysterious thing that passed fro
him to me (our "soul"?) has no effect on my personality or memory. Perhaps,
by amazing coincidence, a good percentage of the atoms in my brain also
resided in the brain of George Washington at some point in his life. If this
were true, I think it would be on the same level of significance as
reincarnation claims.
