<p>
The latest set of messages seem to present a very mixed bag.

<p>
As Greg setup the initial scenario as, *having* a "classic" Drexlerian
assembler, I'm going to have to side with Doug and Billy on the
probability that we can get up there fast and produce livable
environments.  The only thing that would prevent that is a lack
of preparation on our part (i.e. not producing the tools we expect
will be required in a timely manner) or a very well organized
police-'world' environment arrayed against the colonizers.

<p>
Some of the discussion seems to have run off into the realm of
can we get off the planet *to* develop biotech/nanotech to
<a name="2196qlink1">its full capabilities (i.e. how do we avoid the police-state working
against us).  I think the answer here is that you don't.  Since nanotech

<p>
is basically "small" technology, I think you can work on it away from
the 'light of day' and be successful.  When you need big stuff you
can assemble it from little stuff.  Big brother is going to have a hard
time doing global tracking of nanotech mass-drivers that launch
self-assembling nanobots into orbit at supersonic speeds from random
</a>
points around the world.

<p>
<a name="2196qlink2">One thread seems to focus on the problem of getting off the planet fast
because we must to survive (presumably due to creeping grey goo).
I want to go on record that I think Grey Goo is an irrational fear
given the logical development trends.  Grey Goo does have mass
<br>
(element abundance), energy and disassembly design constraints.<br>
I do *not* believe that those will be easy problems to work around
and they do suggest possible avenues for defense.  The only scenario
I can imagine in which Grey Goo becomes a serious threat is if a
significantly enhanced amoral intelligence develops and designs it *or*
self-evolution is allowed on a much faster than real-time, real-world
simulation.  Without one of those two situations, I believe that
defenses
<br>
would keep pace with or even ahead of any offenses.</a>

<p>
<a name="2196qlink3">With regard to the stale atmosphere issues, these are taken care of by
molecular sorting.  With regard to food production, people seem to be
still thinking ancient-tech.  A full complement of nutritious &amp; tasty
gruels with all the necessary vitamins, proteins, fats &amp; carbohydates
will be able to be produced in bacteria/yeast, directly from sunlight
or electricity, using biotech, long before we have hard nanotech
available.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2196qlink4">With regard to the patchwork code of the human genome and our ability
to augment it, we will have to see how things turn out.  I would offer
a couple of comments -- studies show that mutations in a majority of
genes do not result in fatal defects and transgenic animal studies have
shown that we often have backup systems for any single function
<br>
(this makes sense given that the prototype mammalian genome has been<br>
duplicated at least twice).  So I think there is going to be a lot of
junk
<br>
and a lot of extra stuff we don't need.  The question will become --
do you simply bite the bullet and generate as many new "improved"
genomes as fast as you possibly can, recycling the failures (as nature
does) or do you wait a little, expand your computational capacity and
do all the genome experimentation in silico where you don't have to
worry as much about whether people see you feeding the dead babies
to the hydroponic yeast blob?
