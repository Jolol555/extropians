	Really?  I'm not so sure about that.  It all depends upon the level of
each person's respective objectivity.  Since religions fundamentally have a
core of irrationality, it would take more than one "rational thinking
human" to compromise his/her views to create a religion.  This begs the
question of whether rationalism is a learned trait (i.e.: can be taught) or
a developed trait.  Could each generation feasibly teach their children the
importance of rational thinking, or would the children still have the
ability to jettison that rationalism for the sake of blind faith?  I guess
we'll have to wait to find out...
