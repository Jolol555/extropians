Hello everyone,

<p>
I don't have my plans set in concrete yet but it looks like I will be going 
to a party put on by the little eatery where my brother's girlfriend works.  
This is a relatively intimate affair with only fifty tickets available but I 
have through him "connections."

<p>
He said this year they are going all out and at major expense the place will 
be decorated to look like the inside of a spacecraft with the employees 
wearing uniforms and spacesuits to go along with the motif!  The owners 
really want to make an impression and alot of people who have heard about it 
and want tickets won't be able to get them.

<p>
I might also attend a local church party to see old friends.  In past years 
here in Anchorage things could be better when it came to celebrating New 
Year's Eve but this year should be different.

<p>
The best party here is the "Zombiefest" that celebrates Halloween.  People 
go all out with their costumes and the live bands are great.  Last year 
there were alot of Xena's!  I dressed up as a devil complete with big horns 
to only wind up in the cab of an evangelical!! lol

<p>
Several years ago I went to a party at the Hilton here.  I had bought my 
ticket in advance only to find out when I got to the door that the 
celebration was sponsored by an all black college fraternity alumni 
organization.  I was the only white male there in a sea of black faces! lol

<p>
Actually, I was treated very courteously and enjoyed myself.  The spread was 
great and I made some new friends.  But when I walked out to the music I 
knew I was totally outclassed.  My dancing skills were not up to what was 
going on at the dance floor!  Several hundred people were actually dancing 
in near perfect syncronization!  I had never seen anything like it before.  
I was afraid that if I started dancing everyone would turn around and have a 
good laugh. lol

<p>
The next day at work I told a black friend about my experiences.  He smiled 
and said that now I knew just a little how he felt at times in appearing 
different to others.

<p>
Anyway, I hope to have a memorable New Year's Eve this year.  Even if the 
actual calendar system is flawed, still on a human level this will mean so 
much to most of us.  And Samael, get involved in the shindig going on under 
you window! :)


<p>
best wishes for all,

<p>
John Grigg
