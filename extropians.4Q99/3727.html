How would you know whether a given AI is a Power?  Maybe it is bluffing
you.  Maybe it got up to IQ 1200 and hit a bottleneck, and it decided,
what the hell, might as well enjoy itself among all these stupid humans.

So if some marvelous AI (or god, for that matter), says, "Behold, Elizer,
for I am the one true AI, who sees all and knows all, and it is my will
that you lay down your life for the Absolute Good of the universe,"
won't you have a teeny bit of skepticism?  How could you know whether
it is really as smart as it claims?
