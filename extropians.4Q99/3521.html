<p>
Entirely true, especially since *peak* power can be sold to the utilities
at higher prices- simple earthbased photovoltaic without storage is very
closee to being profitable even now, while O'Neill-type space systems would
require huge risky investments with poor ROI.

<i>&gt; or ship something.  Give me exclusivity on the Mars to Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; FedEx route and I'll show you a rich man.</i><br>

<p>
Actually, with direct entry into the Mars atmosphere, Mars is easier to get
to than the moon, in terms of delta-V.  Granted, you need a larger crew
vehicle for the longer mission duration, but if it's a colonization
mission, you need the living quarters anyway.  It has advantages for
near-term colonization in that volatiles can certainly be extracted from
the atmosphere.  As for Mars to Earth transportation, the propulsion can be
supplied by a single stage *pressure fed* LOX-methane rocket, about the
dumbest of dumb boosters.

<p>
<a href="3464.html#3521qlink3">&gt; The idea of "colonizing" a planet has been discredited since</a><br>
<i>&gt; O'Neill showed it was entirely unnecessary.  I think Greg</i><br>
<i>&gt; is right, that the Mars folks are a bunch of romantic</i><br>
<i>&gt; idealists in love with their pipe dreams.</i><br>

<p>
A dispassionate examination of the detailed trades seems not to favor
either approach.  I've been a senior assoiciate of SSI *and* a Mars
Undergrounder, so I've looked at both pretty closely, and it seems a wash.
 
<p>
<a href="3464.html#3521qlink4">&gt; Since you have to have a completely sealed environment anyway</a><br>
<i>&gt; (otherwise your atmosphere leaks out) you are never going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; lose any H2O.  So you can get buy with a lot less than you</i><br>
<i>&gt; need in an Earth based environment.  With colonization you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are going to need power, lots of it, and for that the moon</i><br>
<i>&gt; is better.</i><br>

<p>
Habitats leak, and badly.  Current state of the art, given the trades
between fabrication costs, mass per unit volume, etc, yield habitats with
nearly 1%/day overboard leakage.  Every joint, hatch, power feedthrough,
and window mount _leaks_, and substantial amounts of makeup gases and water
will be needed.

<p>
Power is the weakness of Mars bases, volatiles *and* power (2 week nights)
are both a problem for lunar bases.  An appropriate asteroid may allow good
access to sunlight for power as well as containing adequate volatiles, but
if the delta-V requiremenat are low, the launch windows are rare, a
catch-22 of the synodic period.

<p>
Thus:

<pre>
Attribute         Moon               Mars                NEO
Launch window     Daily              22 months           2+ years
Flight time       3 days             9 months            3-6 months
Stay time         indefinite         16 months           years at minimum
Volatiles         Polar ice/concrete Atmosphere          Chondrites?
Delta-V from LEO  6 km/s             3.5 km/s            3.5 to 6 km/s
Delta-V return    2.5 km/s           6 km/s              0.5 to 2 km/s
Sunlight          1350 W/m2          470-690 W/m2        &lt;1350 W/m2
Nights            350 hr             12 hr               avoidable

</pre>
<p>
<a name="3627qlink1">The tradeoffs are not immediately obvious.  I think the moon's south pole
might be best *if* volatiles can be extracted, since it would have frequent
launch windows, short travel times, and reliable power (if only in limited
geographical locations). While the delta-V for landing is high, the short
trip time allows use of high performance cryo stages.</a>

<p>
Without lunar volatiles, I feel Mars would be a better choice, and random
NEOs might have advantages at particular times, but at the cost of very
long manned missions.

<p>
<a href="3464.html#3521qlink5">&gt; &gt; &gt;You're still dead if there's a decompression. You still leak stuff</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;outside and have to continuously replace it. But you cannot launch</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;anything with a mass driver from the surface, with the possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;exception of the top of Olympus Mons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Eugene, I don't think thats accurate.  If you've got calculations</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd like to see them.  NASA is studying mass drivers to assist</i><br>
<i>&gt; launching on Earth, so I would think they have to work on Mars.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The question comes down to whether the friction limits launch</i><br>
<i>&gt; speed to sub-orbital rates, in which case you need rocket assists.</i><br>

<p>
You don't need mass drivers on Mars- a skyhook lowered from Phobos can
troll through the upper atmosphere at about mach 1 (250 m/s in cold CO2),
with a good taper ratio.  Indeed, Phobos &amp; Deimos are wonderful resources
for O'Neill development in the Mars system, far better than our own moon.

<p>
<a href="3464.html#3521qlink6">&gt; &gt; &gt;Mars should be a second</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;step. If you have the Moon, Mars is easy. Not vice versa. And you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;can't do both, it's too expensive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you did self-replication here on Earth first, you could do them</i><br>
<i>&gt; both very quickly and very cheaply...</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, if we had some ham, we could have ham &amp; eggs, if we had some eggs...
