I think you are imagining a more sudden transition than I find plausible.
But if you had more CPU than you want to use running a single copy of
yourself very fast, because interactions with humans is too slow, you
could just create copies of yourself to interact with.  And if that wasn't
satisfying enough, you could upload ten people and makes lots of copies of
each of them.  I seriously doubt that after a thousand people had been
uploaded you'd be pining for more, rather than enjoying interacting with
perhaps billions of copies each of the thousand humans uploaded.
