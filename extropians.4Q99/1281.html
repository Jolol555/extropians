OK.  I now see how people can have an inability to learn or act from social 
programming, thus developing into a sociopath. But, that doesn't explain

Such a classification would definately indicate brain damage (putting aside 
it may be the philosophy of a normal brain) and I would look toward 
medication and/or surgery along with cognitive therapy.</a>  Before doing so
