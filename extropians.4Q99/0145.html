<a href="0107.html#0145qlink1">&lt;&lt;  No (though those do in fact exist), it's a taser that uses two </a><br>
 UV laser beams instead of metal wires to guide the current 
 to and from the target. I don't think there's a working prototype
 yet, mainly due to a lack of funding ( wouldn't this be something 
 for something like "idea futures", btw? -- I mean, this thing has 
 *huge* market potential) The device has been mentioned at least 
 twice before on this list, but I can't find the posts in the archives 
 and I didn't have much luck with the web search either so far.
 Here's the "regular" taser's home page, btw. Has lots of info.

 &lt;&lt;[dart guns]
<br>
  Yes, good idea. That should increase the chances of a successful
 toxin delivery quite a bit (assuming that every dart can knock out
 the attacker by itself, of course).&gt;&gt;

<p>
Or even if only, say, 25% to 50% hit.  Still need something potent.  
 
<p>
<a href="0107.html#0145qlink2">&lt;&lt; I'm pretty sure there's something useful out there. Perhaps </a><br>
 some animal toxin (<a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/~ddbfry/menu.html">http://www.uq.edu.au/~ddbfry/menu.html</a>
 has quite a list). "Zombie powder" is made from some kind
 of fish poison, afaik. It would certainly take someone out,
 but perhaps there would be some, uh, brain damage (though
 it is also suggested that the brain damage is a result of
 oxigen deprivation in the coffin, and not the toxin itself).&gt;&gt;

<p>
I keep thinking of curare and its derivatives, or perhaps a powerful 
benzodiazapine mix (something fast but short acting to put em under and 
something long acting to keep them there).  A benzodiazapine would be less 
likely to induce respiratory failure than a barbituate (but give me enough of 
a barbituate, and I Guarantee I'll put you to sleep--ever hear of a 
phenobarbotal coma&lt;g&gt;?).

<p>
<a href="0107.html#0145qlink3">&lt;&lt; I think that Mike meant actual attacks by grandmothers etc., but</a><br>
 anyway...Accidents will always happen, I guess, but I'd rather be 
 "accidentally"zapped or shot with some nonlethal than a regular 
 gun.&gt;&gt;
 
<p>
Same here. 
 
<p>
<a href="0107.html#0145qlink4">&lt;&lt;  I think the above applies to the weaker models; a 500,000 v</a><br>
 stun gun should do the job a lot faster (and I suppose you 
 could go even higher, maybe even to 1000,000 v).&gt;&gt;

<p>
True, but the tradeoff is increased chance of lethality.

<p>
Thanks for the input.
