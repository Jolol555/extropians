 &gt; That was the Siljan Gas Project, where they drilled in the region
 &gt; around lake Siljan in Sweden. The place is rather interesting, an old
 &gt; impact crater (a few tens of kilometers across) where Gold's theories
 &gt; said methane would have been trapped beneath the rock. There was quite
 &gt; a bit of interest in the drilling, not unlike participating in a
 &gt; lottery (OK, the likeliehood of winning is slight... but IF you
 &gt; win!). As you said, the project failed to find any oil or gas.

<p>
Gold, in <a href="http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/usgs.html">http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/tg21/usgs.html</a> claims otherwise:

<p>
"It was quickly ascertained that just the area of the Siljan structure was
quite anomalously rich in soil
<br>
methane and other light hydrocarbons, that many ordinary water wells produced
copious amounts of
<br>
gas and that a number of stone quarries in the area had oil seeping out of the
rocks and making oil
<br>
pools in the ground. It is true that the stone quarries were in the
sedimentary rock which fills a ring
<br>
shaped depression, but those sediments are nowhere deeper than 300 meters. Oil
seepage generated
<br>
after 360 million years from such a small quantity of sediments seemed
improbable. Aside from the
<br>
ring shaped depression, the basement rock is very close to the surface in the
whole area; there is
<br>
barely enough soil for the trees to grow both inside and outside the Siljan
Ring feature.

<p>
As a result of the clear demonstration that the area was quite anomalous for
its hydrocarbon content,
<br>
it was decided to engage in a major drilling operation. Since 1986 two wells
have been drilled: one to
<br>
a depth of 6.7 kilometers, the other to a depth of 6.5 kilometers. Both holes
showed the presence of
<br>
methane and of other hydrocarbon gases, as well as of crude oil. While in the
first hole (Gravberg I)
<br>
diesel oil was used for a time as a component of the drilling mud, only
water-based mud was used in
<br>
the second hole (Stenberg 1), which is situated in the center of the ring, and
is 12 km distant from the
<br>
ring sediments, and also from Gravberg 1. Although the detailed chemical
makeup of the oil found at
<br>
deep levels in Gravberg was not the same as diesel oil, many considered
nevertheless that the diesel
<br>
drilling oil could be held responsible. Some 15 tons of oil were pumped up,
oil that had hydrocarbon
<br>
components and organo-metallic compounds that are frequently in natural crude
oils, but were absent
<br>
or present only in very much lower abundance in any of the drilling fluids...

<p>
The scientific investigations carried out on products of the two holes have
thus demonstrated that
<br>
hydrocarbons are present deep in granitic rock in the complete absence or
proximity of any
<br>
sedimentary materials and in a distribution that leaves no reasonable doubt
that they have come from
<br>
deeper levels. The mix of the different hydrocarbon molecules, both of the
gases and the oils, is quite
<br>
a typical mix, as it is found in other oil and gas producing regions. The
quantities of oil and gas that
<br>
appear to be present in this 44 km diameter formation, tested in two distant
locations, appear to be
<br>
very large, as judged by the porosity measurements and the vertical intervals
showing high
<br>
concentrations."

<p>
He also mentions the sludge you cite, for example:

<p>
" Production flow rates could not be achieved in either hole, apparently
because in a
<br>
confluent flow towards the wellbore, the sludge quickly concentrates and
blocks the pores."

<p>
Perhaps for that reason the project was deemed a failure.
