<p>
Fellow Extropians,

<p>
	We've been working on building a new infrastructure for the
extropy web sight.  We're in the process of moving to a new server
<br>
(Provided graciously by David McFadzean) and have installed a bunch of<br>
tools like jrun, java server pages, a MySQL database and so on.  We
now have our own machine dedicated to www.extropy.com.

<p>
	The first addition using this infrastructure is the new Extropy
Bookstore.  You can see a mostly working prototype here &lt;URL:
<a href="http://www.extropy.com/bookstore/agent.jsp">http://www.extropy.com/bookstore/agent.jsp</a>&gt;. You can type in a title
and it will go off and search all affiliates for the best price.  And
if you make a purchase from the resulting pages, the Extropy Institute
will receive the amount indicated.  Feel free to use this extropy
agent to help you find the best price for all your shopping during the
upcoming holiday seasons.

<p>
	But of course, there is lots more we'd like to do with all
this.  We'd like to make the agent more reliable, add more book stores
to search, make the results page have a more useful format, create a
database of extropian ranked and recommended books which can be
purchased through this agent...

<p>
	So, if anyone wants to help out with some java programming,
MySQL, Java Server Pages, dynamic html graphic layout...  or has any
other ideas of how we can make things better, Please give us a call!
We can use any and all help!

<p>
	As it says on the book store page: Help us create the heaven
some others only pray and die for.

<p>
	Onward!
