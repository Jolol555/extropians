<a name="0911qlink1">This would address the problem of people not being willing to pay enough for our
children's education.  But that is not a real problem.  As it is, it is a really
bad investment to educate our children.  Our children would be financially</a> better
off if we stuck the money into a trust account for them, instead of spending it
on education.

<a name="0667qlink2">Our current system of education is too expensive, it encourages crime and other
social pathologies, and it is a total failure at making children smarter. As it
stands the best thing people can do for their children is to make sure they start
life with a good set of genes.
