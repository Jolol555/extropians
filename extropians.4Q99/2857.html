"Look here -- they're burning books in Edinburgh and trashing genetically
modified crops in Mexico. The New World Order, which is run by retread
sixties flower children, is being attacked by cybernetic hippies in
Seattle; meanwhile  they're uploading lobsters in San Diego. What sort
of sense does that make?! I tell you, this time-line is silly!"

"It's not silly, I tell you! It's a very good time-line. Singularity
guaranteed by 2030, or your money back."

"Listen, this time line has 'satire' written all over it. The Russians
are threatening to vote communist! They've managed to make nematode worms
immortal but they couldn't put an astronaut on the Moon in the next
decade! Tofu turns out to have hidden health hazards! The nations of
Europe have finally unified without a dictator somewhere in the frame,
and the first thing they do is turn their attention to harmonizing the
curvature of bananas! And in Alaska they've just made it illegal to
look at a moose out of a moving aeroplane. I tell you, this time line
is SILLY. It has stopped being serious. It doesn't make sense. If this
time line was a TV show it would be 'Monty Python'. Funny, surreal,
satirical, it is NOT SERIOUS! I am telling you that this time line what
you told me would deliver a singularity on schedule IS SILLY!"

<p>
Disagree; it's _amazing_ how much TV most people watch in a week. Can
you imagine how much more they'll lap up given the availability of
cheap, powerful AI-generated brain candy?

<p>
Never underestimate the utility of bread and circuses. Our society
can already provide the bread; now it's time for cheap personalized
circuses.

<p>
(Although the whole nanotech/AI thing leaves me in mind of the joke
about the chicken and the egg. See, there's this chicken relaxing in
bed next to an egg. They're both exhausted, maybe smoking a cigarette.
The egg turns to the chicken and says, "well, now we know.")
