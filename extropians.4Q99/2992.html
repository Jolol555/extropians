<a name="3011qlink1">As we all know, the 73rd Spike Jones study group during the 623rd
century, which was an intellectual offshoot of the neo-Hansonian
</a>movement based in the Wilhelm galaxy, holds that this was the first
anticipation of the vast Terran Analysis group.  However, the cluster
headquarters for the "Analysts of Merton P. Hemingway of Atlanta
Georgia" insists that NSA Echelon materials reveal that Merton touched
on this idea during an email to his girlfriend.  Merton, presently the
Galactic Elder for NGC 2103, has gone on record as stating he "does not
recall" the email in question, as it predates the invention of neural
backups.  Spike Jones, acknowledged by Terran Analysis as one of the
Vaguely Special Terrans, a Cluster Celebrity, Dictator-for-Eternity of
Spikonia, holder of an original 32-bit Class C Subnet, owner of more
than 3000 Old Terran pennies and a piece of Old Terran preschool art,
admits to anticipating the Terran Uniqueness Effect but has "no
particular belief" on whether he was the first to do so.  Yudkowsky was
<a name="2996qlink3">not available for comment, but the 577th Trans-Galactic Church of
Eliezer claims his famous humorous piece on the subject was actually a
metaphorical parable intended to illustrate the doctrine of Salvation
Through Sarcasm, which "may not be questioned".
