I agree that if you look at enough variable pairs you can find spurious
correlations.  But I don't understand how you can be so confident that
Shiller looked at that many variable pairs.  Do you know something about
him personally?  Or do you just dismiss all data tests because someone
*might* have looked at tons of pairs?

<p>

<p>
Along with Hal, I don't find the variables Shiller looked odd or
strange; they seem to me very straightforward variables to test the
idea that post high P/E periods perform less well than low P/E
periods.  And I find the idea that "buy low, sell high" might work

<p>
<a name="1324qlink2">If you were right about Shiller being very selective, then it would
be easy for you and others to publish your own study showing that
your favorite measure of P/E does not predict your favorite measure
of long-term returns.  Know of such a study?</a>
