A better way to do it, as Crocker and I keep saying, would be to break
up the system into modular components that could be more highly
specialized and could integrate new methods in particular areas.  Once
the credentials are given by specialized credentialing organizations
that compete for credibility with employers, then the teachers and
schools can be credentialed by their own independent systems which would
compete for credibility with parents.
