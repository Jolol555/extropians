Chuck,

<p>
There is some justifiable doubt about what Hobbes actually meant
to say in Latin. This is the standard Latin and English expressions, but
they are inconsistent. I suppose I should have used another statement
 he made in English: "Human life in a state of nature ["apart
from or before the institution of the civil state" (my insertion-RMO)]
is a war of all against all."

<p>
It was in this same discussion of the "Social Contract" that he gave
the famous description of human life apart from civilization as "nasty,
brutish and short".  This expresses the point I wanted to emphasize,
but without ambiguity.

<p>
Thank you for your reply,

<p>
Bob
