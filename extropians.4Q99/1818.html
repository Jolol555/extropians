That religion is Christianity that best describes that, not the one I was 
raised in.

<p>
<a href="1804.html#1818qlink2">&gt;For example, last week you insinuated that extropians are anti-religious </a><br>
because &gt;they are ignorant of other traditions and belief systems.  A few 
posts, including &gt;mine, demonstrated that this is incorrect.

<p>
I beg to differ on this claimmed achievement, since I have seen in many 
posting here a generalized conception that Christianity is and has been the 
only path. For evidence of that please see my first quote of yours:

<p>
"Apparently you are oblivious to what religion has been telling people for 
millenia: you are a sinner," --that has been a central principle of 
Christianity, and is the sole inventor of 'original sin;-which is what you 
are refering to, whether you realize it or not.

<p>
Give me an example of a spiritual problem.  I am thinking that "spirtual 
problems" are at their root material problems.  (Often involving common 
things such as deficts or excesses of neurotransmitters or a dearth of zeros 
in one's bank accounts.)  

<p>
<a name="1851qlink1">Fair enough, since you've opened up the barn door on this one, let me release 
the livestock.  Sprititual problem: I miss  Dear Grandpa Waldo; he passed 
away many years ago. Unfortunately, Alcor wasn't in business at the time to 
preseve his biology. So Uncle Waldo is dead and gone-forever.  Now if you 
have a solution for death(a physiological &amp; spiritual problem); you may now 
present your answer.

<p>
If you disagree with my premise, that there is a 'problem' i.e. Uncle Waldo 
being gone from my life; that may be logical, but it certainly doesn't 
address the issue-for me and for many people who have loved ones perish. 
Perhaps a virtual Uncle Waldo may suffice, but then more questions are raised.
