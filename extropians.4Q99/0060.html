<p>
The above just isn't true.  Mike does good work and good science but he and
the truth regularly get carried away by his emotionalism.  (I spent some
extra time to make sure that I said this politely.)  

<p>
Then Lee Daniel adds

<p>
The only reasonable terms are none: public domain. So long as researchers
hold on to the
<br>
mistaken belief that patents protect investment in research instead of
strangling the life out of it,
<br>
progress will continue to be at the present snail's pace. Only complete
freedom of
<br>
information--including complete freedom to do derivative research and
develop competing
<br>
commercial applications--will enable the technology to flourish and grow.

<a name="0071qlink1">Which lead to my question.  

<p>
Does a patent prohibit all unlicensed use of the patented thingie, or just
the unlicensed *commercial* use?</a>  Or, to use a pointed example, if I start
a cryonics cooperative,<a name="0071qlink2"> which is a non-commercial organization whose
members perform their own suspensions on one another, and don't sell
anything to anyone, can I, without paying the patent holders, and without
legal vulnerability, use patented equipment, materials, or procedures?</a>
