<i>&gt; From: Joseph 1 &lt;joseph1@neosapiens.org&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0826.html#0883qlink1">&gt; &gt; "Breed like rabbits"?! "You and me baby are nothing but mammals,</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel"...Really, there's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; no need for such a sacrifice because a) the Singularity, and/or total</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; destruction, will be upon us well before any breeding programs would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; start to have a noticeable effect...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0884qlink1"><i>&gt; I've never been a fan of such reasoning. It's kind of like saying "We don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to worry about running out of natural resources, because Jesus will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; returning in our lifetimes," </i><br>

<p>
Come on, are you really comparing religious myths to logical
consequences of ever accelerating technological progress? If you 
think that the idea of a [relatively near] Singularity/Doomsday 
is "silly", then look at the alternatives: perpetual technological
stagnation due to "social" factors or because suddenly ("magically"), 
against all odds, human knowledge hits a permanent, fundamental 
ceiling which prevents us from developing "strong" AI *and* 
nanotech *and* intelligence augmentation by means of genetic 
engineering. Profoundly illogical, and almost as silly as waiting 
for Jesus IMHO.
</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; or the Golden Bullet of nanotech which will</i><br>
<a href="0826.html#0883qlink2">&gt; magically make all our technological, social, and economic problems</a><br>
<i>&gt; disappear.</i><br>

<p>
No, but it will solve *most* contemporary problems, and of course 
create some new ones that we currently can't even imagine. Planning 
<a name="0884qlink2">ahead for more than, say, 50 years is probably a waste of time. 
Planning ahead for more than a century is utterly absurd. By that
time we'll all be dead or ascended.</a> 
 
<p>
<a href="0826.html#0883qlink3">&gt; History has proven that humanity's predictive powers are often quite</a><br>
<i>&gt; lacking, and certainly no reason not to reasonably plan for the future.</i><br>

<p>
History won't be of much use in the future. Unlike our ancestors,
we're about to change some *very* fundamental things; the fabric
of life itself, one might say. Instead of simply making more and
better monkey-tools, we'll cease to be monkeys altogether. Now
*that's* what I call a revolution.

<p>
<a href="0826.html#0883qlink4">&gt; Raising the average human IQ through a program of Conscious Evolution </a><br>
What do you exactly mean by "Conscious Evolution"? 

<p>
<i>&gt; is a</i><br>
<a href="0826.html#0883qlink5">&gt; worthwhile goal, and one that shouldn't be quashed merely because one model</a><br>
<i>&gt; predicts doom for humanity's future...</i><br>

<p>
That one model (which is in fact two models in one; the roads
to extinction and ascension are paved with the same technologies) 
isn't just any model, but the most likely extrapolation of current
trends. If you have a better model, I'd love to see it.
