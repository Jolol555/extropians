It is probably a recurring theme.  One of the first times I
heard of it when Keith Henson explained his "Far Side Party"
idea to me at Extro3.<a name="1445qlink1">  I would simply refer you to the archives
but feel a need to give you a little more for the question after
viewing what IMO was a less than wonderful response from another
list member.</a>  Perhaps we should divide the list into extropian-newbies
and extropians-OldNJaded.  Or maybe I'm just misinterpreting things.

<p>
At any rate...

The problem is how do you gurantee that "you" will follow "your"
</a>instructions?<a name="1459qlink2">  The only way I can see you getting a favorable
return rate is to have the instruction *hardwired* at the level
of drives like "eating" or "breathing" and having a lot of
error-correction code to prevent any mutations in the "directive".

<p>
If you do manage to do this you are crossing over the line of
enslaving conscious entities (even if they are yourself).  While
I'm of the opinion that this is reasonable if you are doing it with
your property, I know there are others, (Greg Burch for example),
who feel quite the opposite.</a>  You can check the archives for our
discussions on these topics.  I think one of the subjects was
"Mind abuse".

<a name="1459qlink3"><a href="1428.html#1436qlink3">&gt; when they did return, I could form a direct mind connection with each of </a><br>

<i>&gt; linearly.</i><br>

<p>
You have to assume that none of the entities have evolved to the
degree that "merging" memories is infeasible.  I could imagine
scenarios when they would be so different that the "mix" could
short-circuit the individuals involved.</a>

<p>
<a href="1428.html#1436qlink4">&gt; it seems to me that this would be a goal fitting of an extropian,</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1459qlink4">I think it might make more sense to send the individuals off,
maintaining communications with them letting them ship you
idea &amp; experience "objects" (IEOs) from their lives that you can
try on from time to time.  If you have a standard protocol for
idea &amp; experience exchange then you don't have the short-circuit
problems.  You also don't have to wait until the rendezvous time.

<p>
Since there is some cost for sending the IEOs around through space
there is probably some incentive &amp; competiation to give as good as
you get.  Otherwise you get a situation like -- "Spike3472 hasn't sent
me anything good in 20,000 years!  Thats it, he gets nothing from
me for the next centamillenia, we will see if he gets the message".
