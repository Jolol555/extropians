Well, first of all Rob, I guess I was playing devil's advocate; simply 
because I like when I see arguments open to opposition, sometimes I am just 
dumb enough to walk right in.  My main point in responding to this religious 
thread is the most Atheists, I have encountered, seem to be in opposition to 
the ideas and the selling of Christianity, that the "Evangelists" are so in 
love with.  

<p>
Religions seem to have the main character flaw (strength?) that they are 
self-validating. But the 95% of the Atheists appear to have been shaken lose 
from  what I term "nominal Christian culture". The definition of this is that 
they are 'usually' of white, European genetic and cultural heritage; and are 
so ensconced in this "meta-culture" that they are oblivious to all other 
religions/cultures save what is presented on TV (that is before they flip the 
channel or drop the link).  America is definitely this way and so is the UK. 
Or as the racist, bigot, industrialist, Henry Ford used to say;
"You can have any color ya want, as long as its black."

<p>
This is, I attribute, an accident of being raised in a mono-culture. As far 
as God goes, tragedy and sorrow seems to be a faith breaker. But this applies 
to Atheists as well. The curious thing is that most Atheists (outside of a 
B.F Skinner or so)
<br>
seem to remain, pissed off at the human condition.  The gerneralized "faith" 
that existence may continue, despite one's own mortality, seems to be an 
aspect  of the religious; therefore is of some psycho-social, benefit-in a 
purely, paliative way.

<p>
I mean as Chucky Marx said, "religion is the opiate of the people."  Which is 
to say that sometimes people need pain-relief. Einstein's famous letter of 
consolation to Wigner (was it Wigner?) over the passing of their mutual 
friend Michelle Besso wemt something like this:

<p>
"We must not more too much over the passing of Michelle; for as we know from 
the perspective of electrons, Michelle isn't really dead because electrons 
know neither present nor past."  Now I dunno maybe Einstein was freakin 
whankers?  Maybe, maybe not?

<p>
Heck, I also belong to a Many Worlds mailing list, and one of the Templeton 
Foundations Meta lists-so go figure.  One of the things I shan't do is peddle 
"toast City" to ya if ya don't agree, cause ya don't!  Thats an attribute of 
the Churchies, not me. Believe in me or its eternal suffering...Boo!
