Clint,

At work, Monday, meetings....but I want to make a pre-reply to tell you
that your remarks here have evoked, to my delight, an hypothesis that
is based on an old idea but might have a new application.  I'm calling it
the "If You Take Time to Think Theory" or "The Hypertrophied Reason
Hypothesis" to account for the type of ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST
axiom in the "Free Enterprise" Doctrine of  laissez faire Capitalism that
you suggest.  The kind of thing discussed by Adam Smith.  More later.
