Another issue which complicated the problem of consciousness, and makes it
difficult to broach scientifically, is this:
Science is a social phenomena. Someone comes up with a theory and presents
the evidence and proof to the world, and it is science.
But qualia are personal. They are evidence - of their own existence - they
are the strongest evidence ever presented or possible to present - direct,
absolute presentation of themselves - but this evidence is evident only to
the experiencer. Presumably everyone has them and can look at their own..
and I wonder if people who ask for evidence are just trying to be
frustrating.
