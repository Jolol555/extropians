Yes, strictly speaking you are correct, if a bit pedantic. The rate of change
caused by Nanotechnology will  be very fast but not infinitely fast and it will not
happen at one exact instant in time. A mathematical singularity can never happen
in the real world but we can come close, the closest to one happened 65 million
years ago in Mexico. That momentous event's only cause was a few billion tons of
dumb rock and ice, I have no doubt that a few billion tons of smart nano machines
would cause even greater disturbances.

<p>
Please note, when I use  a mathematical term in discussing human beings it
should not always be taken literally. For example, when I say that somebody's
post is going off on a tangent,  I do NOT mean that it is moving on a line that
touches the curve of the  previous argument at only one point.

<a href="2335.html#2403qlink2">    &gt;the arms  race between humans and microbes will continue.  Maybe we can</a><br>
<i>    &gt;evolve  faster than they do, maybe not.</i><br>

<p>
In a thousand years microbes will probably not exist, humans certainly won't, however
I agree that the problem of computer viruses may not ever be entirely solved.

<a href="2335.html#2403qlink3">    &gt;it will no longer be necessary  for some people to die at all, at any age. This too may</a><br>
<i>    &gt;have  dramatic effects on society, or it may not,</i><br>

<p>
I don't use the word "impossible" often but I will use it today, it is impossible for the
elimination of death not to have a dramatic effect on society.

<p>
<a href="2335.html#2403qlink4">    &gt;but in any case this  too will take place within an unchanging framework.</a><br>

<p>
For that to be true the word "framework" would have to encompass everything
conceivable and everything inconceivable, in other words, the word "Framework"
would have to be meaningless or at least useless.
