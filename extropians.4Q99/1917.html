<i>&gt; alternate</i><br>
<i>&gt;  universe" -- c.f. lucid dreaming?</i><br>

<p>
These are all good questions.  In fact, they probably presage the outlines of 
21st century art criticism well.  Just as there have been spectra of quality 
in the creation and appreciation of traditional media - what may come to be 
called the "separate arts" (as a reference to the medium-imposed bright lines 
between "painting" and "music" and "drama" we recognize now), so there will 
be in the new art form(s) I envision.

<p>
You identify one of these spectra in your first question, with its reference 
to "onanism".  Just as the media of literature, painting, photography and 
movies/video have given rise to a spectrum spanning pure pornography on the 
one side, through "erotic art" to works with little or no sexual content, so 
immersive, interactive computer-mediated art will likewise span a similar 
spectrum.  Similarly, the "separate arts" have given rise to a spectrum 
spanning purely subjective works (with abstract expressionism perhaps the 
purest example) on the one end, to "objective" works such as, for instance, 
the overtly didactic painting of Enlightenment painters like David or the 
modern "flat" journalistic style of photography and painting.  One can see 
another spectrum in the "publicness" or "privateness" of art in the 
traditional "separate arts".  On the one hand, one had the great "public" 
works of grand symphonic music, civic architecture, traditional works of 
drama, and painting on the heroic scale of, again for instance, the great 
works of the Enlightenment painters.  On the other, one can see much more 
"private" art in the form of small-scale painting and print-making, 
craft-oriented forms such as "art pottery", traditional chamber music, and 
the like.

<p>
Immersive virtual interactive art will span the same spectra, I imagine (and 
will almost surely give rise to new ones we can't yet envision).  These 
spectra define a multi-dimensional "critical space" into which one can fit 
the potentialities of interactive, immersive multi-media art.  Thus one might 
have purely subjective, totally onanistic and private works or experiences at 
one "corner" of this space, and non-sexual, objective, public works at 
another "corner" of this "critical space".  

<p>
Another dimension in this critical space, "interactivity" is barely presaged 
in some current media and art forms - I'm thinking of kinetic sculpture, 
simulation games and, in the example you cite, perhaps the most fruitful 
progenitor, improvisational music such as modern jazz and traditional Indian 
music.  Thus, I foresee at one end of the spectrum, purely "pre-programmed" 
immersive works in which there is a clear-cut  distinction between audience 
and "creator" (whether the latter is purely human or not, and whether the 
"creator" is a lone individual or a collaborative enterprise between multiple 
people and/or machines) and, at the other end of the spectrum, more 
interactive "works", where there is no clear-cut separation between the 
pre-determined art "object" and the resulting experience of the 
participants/artists/audience.  In this artistic world, our current 
vocabulary distinguishing between creator and audience, instrument and 
product, object and context will all be construed very differently.

<p>
[snip a nice description of the improvisational experience in jazz]

<i>&gt; challenged</i><br>
<i>&gt;  or a nucleus for a qualitatively new form of aesthetic ___________?</i><br>

<p>
Again, I think we are limited by our current vocabulary.  I think "it" is 
both of the things you suggest, and more.  Just as our current distinction 
between "computer" and "peripheral" is increasingly coming into question, 
likewise, I think the distinctions between "medium", "instrument" and 
"object" will be transcended and we will have to develop a wholly new 
critical vocabulary.  Notions such as "theme", "motif" and "dynamics" will 
become paramount and, perhaps, critical concerns with media and 
instrumentalities may come to be seen as quaint or very historically bound, 
such as the conventions of mediaeval iconography now seem to us.
