Somehow I don't think most of them appreciate it as much as I do. This
semester, since The Life of Brian wasn't available, I showed them The Name

strands in Christianity.

P.P.S.: Brian: "Don't let me tell you what to believe; don't let *anyone*
tell you what to believe. You are all different."

Crowd intones: "We are all different."
