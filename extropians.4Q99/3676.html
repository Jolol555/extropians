*nods* yeah, I'd heard about the whole hologram
degradation thing... it would be interesting if the
system were holographic on some levels, backed up on
others.... the MOST important information existing
everywhere independantly... the semi important stuff
on holographic systems... things that are finer in
working and can't work around noise- programs or
applications of some kinds, possibly, might exist in a
few places, with just extra backups...
<br>
Questions:
<br>
What sort of warnings might an intelligent being have
that it's server was about to crash?
<br>
Would escape be allowed? Would their attempts at
escape be hampered by anti-viral mechanisms and
security?
<br>
Would some of these in turn lead to specialised,
government supported, internet data storage "safe
houses" or something of the equivalent that sentiences
could flee to?
<br>
How much would emergency self-storage cost and would
the people in the net be expected to foot the bill, or
people outside- loved ones, family members, etc.,...
or would the government do it?  
<br>
How might this effect taxes?
<br>
How many layers to such a system would you need? How
independant of the physical structure could data
become?
<br>
What kind of interaction would the intelligent being
have with it's server? Could it control it's own
escape? Could it warn people outside if this were not
so?
<br>
Anything in that general field of questions...

<i>&gt; &gt; Subject: Holography</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;       I've been playing around with an idea for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; little bit, though I haven't had the time to put</i><br>
<i>&gt; any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; real look into the feasibility...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;       It goes something like this:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;       If you had a really good holographic data</i><br>
<i>&gt; storage</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; system (one functionally as good or better in</i><br>
<i>&gt; every</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; respect as any modern memory storage) would it be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possible to network the holographic matrix?  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thoughts being something like, "since when you</i><br>
<i>&gt; split a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hologram in two, you get two holograms, what if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; had a bunch of networked computers forming a</i><br>
<i>&gt; single</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; holographic memory between them... so that when</i><br>
<i>&gt; one</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; computer crashed, the network as a whole retains</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; data... so none of the data is lost, only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hardware."</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     However, upon considering the subject I</i><br>
<i>&gt; realised I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; didn't have the slightest idea where to begin...</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; started reading about holography and computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; networks, but I was hoping that by putting this</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; out here I'd encourage some sort of interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; feedback- or at least information as to why it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wouldn't be feasible, were this the case...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     Anyways, it has a lot of applications- for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; we talk about uploading on the list a lot. If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; computer that contains an uploaded personality</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; crashes... what then?  Well, with some sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; holographic system, a stabler form of uploading</i><br>
<i>&gt; could</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exist- one with less risk of destruction in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; case</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of some disaster.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;      Any thoughts on how this might slow down</i><br>
<i>&gt; existing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; networks, how modifications to programs might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; made</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in a holographic system... actually, just about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anything at all relating to this might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting.</i><br>
