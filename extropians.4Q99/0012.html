<i>&gt; &gt; little to me, as I am quite satisfied with my penis size and do not have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; need to impress women by any other means. I take courses that interest</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thought so.  No math credits and no degrees, ay?</i><br>

<p>
On the contrary, I studied mechanical engineering at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute, which is up there with MIT, Stanford, RPI, and
RIT, albiet smaller, but I left due to money problems and a back injury,
joined the Air Force and continued to study engineering, economics,
math, political science, law, oceanography, sociology, as well as
practical things like machining, electrical and electronic systems
design, troubleshooting, and maintenance. I was miserable in a formal
degree program, and have been much happier just taking courses that I
was interested and could use.... I don't care if your particular piece
of lambskin makes you think your other head is bigger than it actually
is. I don't need augmentation to make me happy with my own.
