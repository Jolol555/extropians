I've been thinking about this method of supporting living tissue against
<a name="3650qlink1">the deforming and eventually injurious forces of high g loads--basically
the idea of firing a person out of a cannon without killing them--but I've
never run across a rigorous analysis or even a serious qualitative
treatment of the subject.</a>

<p>
The first edition of Bennett and Eliot's, The Physiology and Medicine of
Diving and Compressed Air Work, presents the results of experiments
conducted to determine the effects on various organisms ( goats and
tadpoles among others) of exposure to elevated hydrostatic pressure.  It's
been a while since I read that stuff, but I seem to recall that
irreversible damage results at pressures between 150 and 300 atmospheres.
Launched in a supine position, immersed in say 9 inches deep (3/4 foot) of
saline, the hydrostatic pressure would vary linearly from zero at the
surface to a maximum at your back, where it would range from 150 to 300
atmospheres at accelerations ranging between 6,670 to 13,300 g's
respectively.  Because the duration of these g forces is likely to be very
brief, I doubt that there would be much of a problem with injury due to
elevated hydrostatic pressure.  (Though I'd certainly want to confirm that
with some experiments on hamsters, before trying it out personally!  ;-)  ).

<p>
Structural stresses is where the problem would seem to lie, and they arise
from the differential between tissue density and the density of the
supporting medium--saline in gene's post.  Bone is, I believe, the most
dense tissue, it should be the least buoyant, the least supported by the
medium, but, of course, it is also quite strong structurally.  Muscle would
be the most dense after that, then watery non-muscle tissues, then fatty
tissues.  The differences between these tissues don't seem like they would
be large enough, however, (ie, I'm guessing here) to make tearing due to
differential buoyancy likely.  That leaves the unsupported weight of bone
bearing down on itself as the likely site of failure.  (This might be
reduced somewhat by making the supporting medium denser still, thus
transferring a little of the stress to the bone-to-flesh attachment.  In
this situation the flesh tends to be buoyed up, lifting up on the bone and
thereby relieving a certain amount of the stress.)

<p>
This is the best I can do on short notice.  If you gene, or anyone knows
"the facts" or has heard of a rigorous treatment of this issue, I'd love to
hear about it.  (I just know the military has worked on this--those
psychos.  Shortly after the successful immersion of mice in fluorocarbon,
some demented darpa animal-torment specialist was no doubt popping them
into 105mm artillery rounds, and yelling, "Fly Mickey, fly!" as he pulled
the lanyard.  The m112 stroke 4 mk I rodent round.  Lovely.)
