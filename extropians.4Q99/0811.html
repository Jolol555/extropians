I agree with the drive to learn and create part.  

<p>
I'm not sure economic competeition will be as much of a drive for
everyone in the future as it is today.  Richard Stallman could have made
a mint on the programming innovations he created, but instead he put
them in the public domain and started the free software movement.  There
are other ways to acheive status aside from economic advantage, and my
guess is that the future will see more people who work primarily for
distinction and recognition.

<p>
Well, someone who is rich today can retire and live off of investments
forever, continuing to grow their wealth and "keep up" financially with
most people who work (Bill Gates can invest in real estate on Titan and
Io, etc). I guess investing is still a kind of work, but not a kind I'd
mind having to do.
