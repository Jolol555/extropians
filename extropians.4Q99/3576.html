<a name="3592qlink1">&gt; The poker analogy [to day trading] is not an accurate<br>
<a href="3571.html#3576qlink1">&gt; one for several reasons.</a><br>

<p>
Name them.  I don't have anything against gambling in either
form, but let's call a spade a spade: it's still gambling, and
the same mathematics apply.  If you can calculate an expectation
and a variance, you can calculate a risk of ruin.  I suspect
yours is higher than you think, but's that's only an impression.
I play a very high variance game so my instincts are developed
for that.  One thing that you do have going for you: you can
decrease your bets when you lose, lowering both absolute EV and
absolute ROR.

<p>
<a href="3571.html#3576qlink2">&gt; I would like to apply some analysis to my trade history in the near</a><br>
<i>&gt; future to find out if the most profitable trades have anything in </i><br>
<i>&gt; common and likewise for the losers.  </i><br>

<p>
Don't be silly.  If that were possible, everyone would have done it
years ago, and nobody would have any losers anymore.  I'm not
disparaging your analysis; I'm sure your evaluations are</a> as good as
anyone's, but they'll never be 100% accurate or even close.  Over time,
you'll make bucketloads of money--but the short term can be a killer.
