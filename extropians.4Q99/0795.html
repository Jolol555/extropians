I thought of that, but unfortunately I'm not an ideal candidate.
To a sperm bank and their consumers, IQ isn't everything.</a>  I do
have that going for me, and I'm tall, generally fit, and don't
have any genetic diseases that I know about (there is some
evidence that Meniere's disease is heritable but it is weak).
But the bank wants someone with a very high sperm count so
inseminations are more successful, and the consumers want donors
with a wide variety of desirable traits and absence of bad ones.
For instance, they like athletic ability and some evidence</a> of
industry and ambition (such as business or academic achievement).
I score low on both those scales.  I can also nearly guarantee a
son that will be bald when he's 30, and with a strong likelihood
of heart problems (I somehow managed to avoid the family heart
problems so far--no such luck with the hairline).  And of course
with artifical insemination, I can't take advantage of my
abundant sexual talents. :)

<p>
My best chances for procreation are going to be doing it the
old fashioned way: charming the pants off a woman who likes
computer nerds.
