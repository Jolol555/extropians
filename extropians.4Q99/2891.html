I live here in Seattle, this is what's going on, the protestors who we all
knew were intent on protesting before this occurrence to the so precieved
greed monopoly WTO. In most parts of down town the protestors remained
</a>
peaceful but from this widespread group evolved an unruly 30 or so people
who began busting out McDonalds, Starbucks (which was promptly looted) and
even the US bank windows. (AAAH, that's my bank!) It was these actions that
inspired the tear gas, apparently there is question as to if there was a
warning for the morning fumes, however I watched live last night, that they
did give warning. Last nite a curfew was imposed, and only a few dotting of
people remained, after curfew in the street and were fumed. Of course Im not
into this tear gas resolve, but it really defeats the purpose of one
wrongdoer to be confronted by a group who makes their statement by
committing another wrong. Martin Luther King had the right idea, peaceful
march, it demonstrates the most genuine class, and can be deemed as
respectable,<a name="2950qlink1"> if you tear up the city, you tend to tear up your credibility.</a>

<a href="2865.html#2891qlink1">&gt;In no small part because small organisations of protestors get</a><br>
