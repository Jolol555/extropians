Aahh -- well... no,  please forgive me, that was not what I meant by the 
term. 

<p>
In fact, some of the most simplistic people I know are highly intelligent, 
educated thinking people. Still I consider simplistic thinking a mistake 
<br>
(Stupidity &amp;  ignorance are not behavioral mistakes, but a state of being). I <br>
make no assertaions about your educucation or status in the world. Only in 
your behavior this moment. If I thought you were stupid, I would have not 
responded to your thoughts.

<p>
Morals, being a human condition are frought with uncertainties and 
complexities.<a name="1462qlink1"> it is glib and condescening *behavior* to pooh-pooh things 
"subjective" and dismiss them. Morals deal primarily with human behavior.
Humans deal in both realms, ob and sub  -  and human behavior</a> is indeed 
complex.
