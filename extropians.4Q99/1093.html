<p>
I wasn't disputing that planning works somewhat differently from
seeing, but that social behavior and personality were not just as
biological and easily affected by damage as the perceptual
systems.

<a name="1281qlink1">Actually, the basic cortical circuit is the same with minor variations
across the entire cortex, including in the prefrontal lobes and the
occipital lobes. The inputs and outputs are usually mainly the
thalamus and other cortical areas, which ones depending on
location. The difference is mainly which inputs each patch of cortex
get. Even in the "highest" parts of the frontal lobes there</a> are cells
that receive inputs from the visual or taste cortex.
