I don't think it's vague so much as nonsense.:)

<br>
I concur.  If that would give a machine understanding,
then how come
<br>
computer programs with bugs in them don't start having
conversations with us?
<br>
I think understanding is going to be a lot harder and
a lot easier than
<br>
that.  Harder because it will not involve some
sophomoric zen-likeformulae.
<br>
Easier because if we just look at how we apprehend the
world we mightbe
<br>
able to just develop machines that understand by
mimicking us, then removing the inessential.

<p>
The problem with radio shack is that it dissapates
with each circuit, if the noise was perpetually
amplified, then the foundations for "understanding"
would exsist.

<p>
How long would it take the people in your world
surrounded by "bare essential &lt;mimick-understanding&gt;"
AIs to start to mimick the AIs.
<br>
A which came first sinario developes equating to
another zen-like paradox, you cannot escape that
easily.
<br>
(If the bugs are atall conserned with us they talk
about us, not to us.)

<a href="2746.html#2782qlink5">&gt;An absolute morality is a pipe dream born out of</a><br>
our desire for cosmic "importance". 

<p>
As absolute morality is based on understanding I
suggest we stick this overinflated consept down the
same pipe. My personal feelings on this are that we do
have great cosmic importance but so equally does every
other peice of matter and (antimatter) in the
universe. Interestingly if you put morality into this
equation our "morals" are of equal importance to those
of interstella dust clouds.

brains to bounce my ideas off, and if people don't get

negatively evaluate the idea and post a response.

<p>
This list is the perfect court for bounceing around
ideas, but ruffleing feathers in order to get a
responce will be uneffective in reaching the more
finely tuned of minds, it will also be unproductive as
people spend more time in defence mode than playing
ball...let the game continue.....
