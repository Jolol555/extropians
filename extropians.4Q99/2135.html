I cannot possibly do a thorough job of placing your remarks within the
scope of a much larger context where [A] they become more generally
meaningful, and [B] they may be subject to proper analysis and criticism.
You have made some sweeping generalizations and described some
parochial views that, in my opinion, are sometimes merely simplistic and
that sometimes are, because of a bias to which you are entitled, of limited
explanatory value.  I wish to emphasize, however, that I am replying to
your post because it expresses, in a very lucid and intelligent way, one
perspective on matters worthy of respectful examination.

<p>
At this time, I will limit myself to responding to your introductory quotation
with some contrasting ones. I do not consider this response argumentative
at all -- it is meant to complement in a preliminary constructive way your
essay, which I consider one dimensional rather than incorrect as such.

'In the 1970s, when quantum theory began employing such terms as "beauty,"
"charm," and "strangeness" to signify the various properties of quarks, a friend
turned to me [as a poet] and said: "You know, they're waiting for you to give
them the words." I saw what he meant, but he was not quite right: Science
does not need art to supply its metaphors. Art and science are alike in their
quest to reveal the world."

It's an experience like no other experience I can describe, the best thing that
can happen to a scientist, realizing that something that's happened in his or
her mind exactly corresponds to something that happens in nature. It's startling
 every time it occurs. One is surprised that a construct of one's own mind
can actually be realized in the honest-to-goodness world out there. A great
shock, and a great, great joy.

Finally, like it or not, Science can no longer isolate itself from the Humanities,
including especially their influence on public opinion and politics.

<p>
"In short, while scientists have generally considered themselves to be the
intellectual descendants of the "Benjamin Franklin" model of the benevolent
scientist, bringing enlightenment to humankind, too often scientists are
actually perceived by the public to be more in the "Dr. Frankenstein" mold,
unleashing scientific havoc on an unsuspecting world.

<p>
"The lesson we need to draw from this phenomenon is increasingly evident:
<a name="2358qlink1">Modern scientists (and their first cousins, engineers) must become as adept
in dealing with societal and political forces as they are with gravitational
and electromagnetic forces--and, candidly, up to this point I would not
give us a passing grade. Today's scientists are no longer constrained
simply by the laws of nature, as was generally the case in the past, but
also by the laws (and attitudes) of the land."

GREAT GOLD MEDAL OF THE ACADEMY- In 1998, it was awarded to Professor
Leo Kadanoff (James Franck Institute, Chicago). Kadanoff is one of the major
pioneers of theoretical physics in our times. He has had a profound influence
on a number of fields: applied mathematics, physics, mechanics, cosmology,
chemistry, and polymer science. The Great Medal is given in recognition of
this exceptional achievement.
