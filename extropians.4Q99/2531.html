<p>
Law seems to have highly specific historical, cultural, technological
(e.g. evidence) and scientific (e.g. "expert" witnesses) aspects.
The variety of chaotic variables may put it beyond "rigorous science"
(though it may be entirely rational) and perhaps force it into the realm
of limited simulations.</a>

<p>
<a name="2535qlink4">Art, seems to have passed through the phase of "rigorous science",
where the artist was simply learning and expressing the reality
of perception (e.g. the "physics" of art)).  Art seems to have
gone through some interesting "observer" stages (realism, e.g.
Thoreau or William Dean Howells in literature, or impressionist
artists in painting).

<p>
<a name="2625qlink6">Greg/Natasha, if you read this -- have/should Law &amp; Art be subject to
some absolutes (akin say to the Hippocratic Oath in medicine) or have
they become (and/or will they continue to be) subject to the
whims or desires of the client/purchaser?  (i.e. a system in
which the value is market driven rather than "rationale acceptance"
driven?)
