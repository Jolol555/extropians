<p>
Actually, sense of humour aside, the important thing to note about
the transportation of convicts to Australia is that it _definitively_
disproved the hypothesis -- prevalent among the English upper class
at the time -- that there existed a "criminal class" whose criminal
nature was hereditary and irreformable.

<p>
As this hypothesis seems to be rather common among the American middle
classes today, and there's a long-running trend toward brutalization
and punishment of criminals rather than behavioural reform and 
social rehabilitation, this is somewhat germane ...

For fun reading, I recommend "The Fatal Shore" by Robert Hughes.
(Transportation wasn't exactly a picnic; arguably the conditions 
the transportees lived under were worse than those in Stalin's
GULAG.)
