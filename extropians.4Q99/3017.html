<a href="2995.html#3017qlink1">&gt;  I propose the thing that must give is our comically inefficient way</a><br>
<i>&gt;  we use land.  I flew over the US today, New York to Dallas to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  San Jose.  It was clear and I spent most of my trip looking at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ground and marvelling, as I often do when I make that ride, at</i><br>
<i>&gt;  how *empty* is most of this country.  The population is highly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  concentrated along rivers.  Look at it next time you fly over.  There</i><br>
<i>&gt;  are huuuuge expanses of open land, with plenty of water, growing things</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that are of no direct benefit to humans, such as scrubby non-lumber</i><br>
<i>&gt;  trees.  The riverbank land is subject to flooding, whereas all that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  good sloping land is nearly untouched.</i><br>


<p>
I'm in total agreement.

<p>
<a name="3024qlink1">As I've mentioned...I travel on the order of a hundred thousand miles a year 
via the highway.  There is unbeleivable emptiness....hiway 50 across Nevada 
and Utah for example....or Texas between San Antonio and El Paso........</a>

<p>
<a name="3024qlink2">Or Canada....Canada is larger than the contiguous 48 yet has only approx one 
tenth the population (as I recall...i may be in error)....of which  the 
greater percentage live within 200 miles of the US border...</a>

<p>
My God is Canada ever EMPTY......and Siberia.......(Dreams of a sub-bering 
straite tunnel......for the London to Terra de Fuego "Interstate"...now THATS 
 LONG HAUL!!!!!)

<p>
<a name="3042qlink1"><a name="3026qlink1">Speaking of Texas......I've heard it said that the entire population</a> of the 
<a name="3026qlink2">earth could be put in Texas with no greater population density than</a> is found 
</a>
<a name="3042qlink2"><a name="3026qlink3">in some European countries.</a>  
</a>

<p>
<a name="3024qlink3">I think that "over population" is another successful meme which has little 
relation to reality....
