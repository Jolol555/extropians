At 12:37 AM 3/11/99 -0500, Dan wrote a nice summary, adding:

<p>
<a href="1748.html#1749qlink1">&gt;I presented an example similar to this when I said that the character 7</a><br>
<i>&gt;simply referred to that theoretical invention of ours, the number seven.</i><br>
<i>&gt;So with the real world, balls, horses, etc.  Each of these words refers to</i><br>
<i>&gt;internal theoretical constructs; we judge the theories based on their</i><br>
<i>&gt;explanatory/predictive value.</i><br>

<p>
Standard apres-Sausurre poststructural (Derridean/Lacanian) analysis might
cast this in terms of signifiers, signifieds and (inaccessible) referents,
with many signifieds being, in turn, signifiers pointed to by other
signifiers.  Rudely: signifier = word, signified = concept, referent =
thing in the word that the concept stands in for, to some degree of
adequacy. A symbol is a seamless blend of signifier and signified.

<p>
In practice, referents often seem to drop out of this account. Putnam's
version, as Dan describes it, seems to work the same way.

<p>
I assume a cog sci/neurosci account would want some more hidden layers. Dan
says:

<p>
<a href="1748.html#1749qlink2">&gt;Under anti-realism, the internal symbol "ball" simply refers to the</a><br>
<i>&gt;internal theoretical construct of a ball.  </i><br>

<p>
Here, a poststruck account would presumably say that the signifier `ball'
(whether inwardly thought or uttered aloud/written) stands in for the
signified &lt;ramified concept of a ball&gt;. The cog sci equivalent, I assume,
would be the neural attractor or web synaptically activated by most
situations that involve either the idea of a ball or the perception of an
actual or represented ball in the outside world.

<p>
I conclude that Putnam and poststructuralism offer a story that's not as
ridiculous as it first sounds (and is similar to Humberto Maturana's,
perhaps), 

<p>
[ e.g., <a href="http://www.oikos.org/maten.htm">http://www.oikos.org/maten.htm</a>   ]

<p>
<a name="1758qlink1">but both risk losing their grip on/need for access to a genuine referent
out there (whatever that means in a QT/relativistic universe).
