I don't have much more.  We do know that in situations</a> of extreme poverty,such as
<a name="1992qlink4">during famine, people show the *least* social bonding.  And as we have
gotten richer, we have spent more time on activities whose primary purpose
I think is social bonding: leisure, education, and health care.  So</a> I hypothesize

<p>
that social bonding is more important as you get richer.

<a href="1904.html#1920qlink2">&gt; &gt;  So will the people who dominate the future be those who follow their</a><br>

<i>&gt; Hmm -- you know, I interpreted this question to be more about "fun" than</i><br>

<p>
I meant "fun" as well.
