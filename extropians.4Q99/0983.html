 Of course, the Kansas Board of Creationist

Children are helpless in their earliest years, which are their most intense
learning years, wherein they are not only at their most impressionable, but
most helplessly and uncritically so.  Various groups take an active
interest in them at this time: family, local community(local political
forces), and nation(larger political forces).  Each of these is
politicized, each has their own self-interest at heart, so the training
program for young 'uns is subject to distortions according to the bias of
each group.

<p>
<a name="1017qlink1"><a name="1015qlink1">Ander's suggestion seems an excellent approach to creating educational
resources that are *graded* for either a minimum bias or a most broadly
approved bias.

<p>
The tough part for me is that children are in the captivity of their
parents, and their intellectual development subject, virtually without
oversight, to whatever flakiness the parents think of as proper</a> upbringing
</a>
and proper belief, particularly in the earliest, most intense learning
years when the schools aren't even in the picture yet.  (Not to make this
seem worse than it is, most parents are just fine, with broad, largely
benign, and somewhat malleable cultural biases.  Only a few fundamentalist
and other wackos do serious damage. IMNSHO.)  Also, what with the view of
"parental rights", and the intangible nature of intellectual development,
*damage* in that area is not easily seen, or seen as such.  What ends up
happening is that a certain group becomes identified as being *that way*,
as if it were an inherent part of their nature. The *lower* classes.
