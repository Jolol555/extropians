<i>&gt;  Adkins thinks you cannot be healthly unless in</i><br>
<a href="2657.html#2706qlink1">&gt;  ketosis at least part of the time.   Only in ketosis can body clean-out</a><br>
<i>&gt;  excess cholesterol, etc. from arteries!  If you have all the energy you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  need from a carbs all the time, the body cannot deal with whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fat is left in the diet to deposit God Knows Where!??</i><br>

<p>
+Atkins can't possibly be that ignorant.  The liver can process fat to other
+things and fat cells take it up avidly.

<p>
James Admits:  Maybe that isn't what he said...my memory isn't perfect.
However, "fat cells take it up avidly" is exactly what we don't want to
happen
<br>
and what I meant when I said depositing fat "God Knows Where!".
<a name="2712qlink1">What are these other things fat is processed to in the liver</a> without
ketosis?

<p>
+Plaque regression happens just fine
<br>
+w/o ketosis (c.f. work on Pritikin and Ornish diets)

<p>
<a name="2712qlink2">James Wonders:  Is there never any ketosis on the Priikin and Ornish diets?</a>
<a name="2712qlink3">How is fat used-up or lost when "glucosis" is never interupted?  Serious
question as I am no expert on this by any means...just trying to explore
the issues without dilligent study of the field.
