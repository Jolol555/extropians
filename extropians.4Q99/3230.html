It is rumored that I at one time said.
<br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<a href="3210.html#3230qlink1">&gt;  &gt; Do what I do.  'Surf' the interest.  That is take of advantage of the </a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; 'teasers' then when it goes up...pay it off and get a new 'teaser'.</i><br>

<p>
To which Robert J. Bradbury replied.

<p>
<a href="3210.html#3230qlink2">&gt;  Yes but its a pain-in-the-papoochka strategy.  It ought to be easier</a><br>
<i>&gt;  for the cardholders to act collectively and send letters to the bank</i><br>
<i>&gt;  telling them if they raise the rates above X% they will lose their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  business.  Logically, with reliable cardholders, the banks should</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be able to make money at something like 2-3% above mortgage rates</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (since these are "unsecured" loans).   So that means a rate of 9-10%</i><br>
<i>&gt;  should be about right for both parties.</i><br>

<p>
Yup...nothing comes easy.

<p>
How ever...since you mentioned it I do use a credit card that has an interest 
rate of approx 12% for my primary business usage.  Theyre out there you just 
have to look for them.  The best strategy is to let them find you.  I get 
five or ten offers for credit cards a month.

<p>
It's an embarassment of "riches" and can easily lead to disastorous mistakes. 
 You must disipline youself or you risk ruin.  That is....never have a 
balance (pay off the entireity each month).

<p>
In some cases that is inconvient which is why 'surfing the interest" comes in.
