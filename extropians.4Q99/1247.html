<a name="1308qlink2">Religion pre-dates science by tens of thousand of years. A limited number of 
scientists were involved in the torture-murders at the Nazi camps, There were

thousands have worked, over the decades,  in the biowarfare and nuclear 
weaponry, which is currently aimed at civilians.</a>

scientists to being such great moral authorities is as crazy as holding 
religious leaders to such great esteem.
