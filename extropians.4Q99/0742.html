Not necessarily. The Libertarian Party got its first two million votes
in an election with less than 1000 paying members of the national
organization.

<a name="0747qlink1">Moreover, Fred's statement is just as applicable to Libertarianism, as
one party delegate said once when someone complained the party needed to
get more organised:"If we were more organized we'd have to disband."
 Yet there is such a party, and the pary's main goal is to change
government to such a point where a Libertarian Party is not necessary.
An Extropian Party should have a similar goal.</a>

<p>
I don't think Ron Paul is a 'kook', despite the LP's pro-pot stance, nor
do a large percentage of the general population. Ventura is more of a
kook than Paul, and look at him. Maybe its the sort of time that a few
kooks could make it into office....
