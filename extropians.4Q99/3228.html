Interesting.

I grew up not far south of there.  I had an uncle who was a guard at pantex.  
He had some (very generic) stories for us kids.

 "heads were in the clouds" and they would regularly forget where they</a> parked 
their cars.....or worse.....get an IDEA while standing in the parking lot and 
.............just stand there........thinking......and risk illness by 
exposure (Amarillo has severe weather extremes...it gets very chilly or very 
hot...depending upon the time of year...and it's always very windy).

<p>
I never considered the "turd in the punch bowl" aspect....but it makes sense. 
 You can imagine my cultural shock when I entered the AF in 1970.
