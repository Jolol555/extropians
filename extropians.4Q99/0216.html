The test results returned stated that KPJ belongs to the ``AN'' cathegory
&lt;URL:<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~womens_voices/BF100/TYPEAN.html">http://members.tripod.com/~womens_voices/BF100/TYPEAN.html</a>&gt;:

Your score placed you in the category of Androgyne. This is the true middle of
the road, neither butch nor femme. You may also wish to review Soft Androgyne
and Hard Androgyne, the two categories surrounding you. In a ranking across the
femme/butch gamut, if 1 is femme and 100 is butch, you fall between 48 and 52
on the scale. For a review of where you fall in the overall population in
numbers, refer to this chart. Your group encompasses folks of all types,
genders, and orientations, though is not as large a part of the population as
the hard and soft androgynes surrounding you.

Hm. Interesting.

<a name="0219qlink1">How do the test makers know this:

\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
Odds are good astrologically that you are a Libra, Pisces, Gemini, or Aquarius.

? It happened to be correct in this case, BTW.
