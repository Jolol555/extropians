Since Microsoft doesn't make computers, I assume you meant 'Intel machines'.

<p>
Ever hear of the DEC Alpha?  Early versions tended to be 2-3 times faster
than the best Intel chips around, and Microsoft got rather exited over the
potential to invade the workstation software market.  So, they ported
Windows NT, all of their server software, and some of their desktop programs
to work on the new chip.  Unfortunately, Alpha machines ended up being</a> much
more expensive than their slower Intel-based cousins, and very few people
wanted to pay that much extra.  As a result the Alpha never really caught
on, and it is probably doomed to remain a niche market.

<p>
Moral: Microsoft is perfectly willing to write software for any hardware
platform that has a reasonable chance of achieving mass-mnarket success.
Intel is successful because of its own competitive ability, not because
Microsoft freezes out potential competitors.
