<a name="0830qlink1"><a href="0813.html#0824qlink1">&gt;&gt; So....what was Dr. George asking when he said "Are you being forced to</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; laugh..."?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0813.html#0824qlink2">&gt;He was likely trying to see if the laughter was just due to the</a><br>
<i>&gt;laughter reflex or due to positive stimulation of the limbic</i><br>
<i>&gt;system. A big deal of difference.</i><br>

<p>
I see what you're saying, but if this is so, then which answer would point
to which conclusion, and why? What is or is not being FORCED to laugh?
</a>
<a name="0830qlink2">Choosing to laugh? You mention either a reflex or positive stimulation of
the (entire?) limbic area.....so which one would produce a conscious choice
to laugh or not in the subject? Neither, that's which.....and this is the
source of the suspicion I give below.</a>


<p>
<a name="0830qlink3"><a href="0813.html#0824qlink3">&gt;&gt; There is no "force", this</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is the way the mind works. I think the problem may rest with the common</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; misconception of "free will" meaning that a human spirit (or whatever) is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; completely responsible for the self-definition of it's motivations,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; impulses, or "will".</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0813.html#0824qlink4">&gt;Sure. But I think you make a mistake by attributing this view to</a><br>
<i>&gt;Dr. Mark George, of whose views we actually know nothing.</i><br>

<p>
Of course, my speculation was just that - a speculation..."I think the
problem MAY rest...."
<br>
You've got to admit, the view I described is very, very common, even in
scientists whose field of specialism comes very close to the critical points
mentioned....
