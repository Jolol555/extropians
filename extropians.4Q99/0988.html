There is no way I can summarize my view by email because I find it necessary 
to show applications as well.  Just explaining one-on-one takes hours.

<p>
But basicly it all comes down to, Every animal strives for pleasure and to 
avoid pain.  I see this in every type of animal behavior I observe.  I take 
this furthure and say it is because they are selfish. Every animal community 
works together for the benefit of everyones selfish desire, more or less.  
Those who are better at controlling the group sometimes persecute those that 
threaten (in their mind) that individual's pleasure feeling.  My philosophy 
is to not allow that to happen because what if some else became stronger 
than me, and thus persecuted me?  My hope is, by showing others that if 
noone persecuted anyone then we could all acheive are pleasure.  And if we 
work together for each others safety we can each have the most pleasure with 
the least amount of pain.  This is were I usualy bring up why we should have 
city state governments, some governments for whos ideals are different.  
Overall no government should control people but people should control the 
government.

<p>
I hope that answers your question.
