I have to agree with John (and I continue to be 100% invested in stocks). I
also see most technical analysis as little better than astrology. While I
do not go along with the authors of "Dow 36,000", who argue that the Dow
deserves to be at that level *now*, I do expect a continuing rise in stock
prices over the next decade, barring bad policy errors (such as a big rise
in protectionism, rising tax rates, etc.).

<p>
A much better book, IMO, is "Dow 100,000" by Charles W. Kadlec. He uses
economic analysis rather than technical analysis to make a case for Dow
100,000 over the next 20 years --- a quite historically average gain of
11.1% per year. Kadlec gives an excellent review of the economic,
demographic, and policy factors likely to keep the stock market rising,
despite short term set-backs. I find his case well argued and plausible. I
also feel confident that I can do better than 11.1% per year by carefully
picking well-managed companies in rapidly growing areas of technologies
that have a special edge, and by using back-tested stock-picking screens
(mechanical investing strategies). So far, my confidence is being backed by
performance (I'm up over 42% so far this year).

stock prices ten years from now? (The difficulty will be in agreeing on an
index to use.)
