<p>
Ritalin is not amphetamine, and I don't think anyone was asking if it was.</a>
However, Ritalin *is* an amphetamine-like drug and is in the same small
class of drugs as amphetamines.  It shares all the effects and
side-effects of amphetamines, which incidentally were also used to treat
ADD-like symptoms several years back.  Problems with amphetamines, such as
addiction, weight-loss, psychotic episodes, etc. are also known
side-effects of Ritalin and are fully documented by the manufacturer and
FDA.  

<p>
While some of the more severe side-effects (such as psychotic
episodes and violent behavior) only affect a small percentage of people on
the drug, the shear number of boys on it these days is going to create a
large pool of boys in absolute numbers who will experience these
side-effects.
