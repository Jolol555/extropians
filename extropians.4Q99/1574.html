There was a little tongue-in-cheek in my post this morning, but also a kernel 
of strongly-felt value. Exchanging the mainstream superstition of traditional 
christianity for some new, more fashionable brand of ju-ju is not a step 
forward.  The point of my post was that the New Age "believe-in-everything" 
mentality is just as bad, if not worse in its own way, than the rigid 
orthodoxy of traditional christianity. 

<p>
I wonder if you find that I am being "intolerant" in my condemnation of New 
Age mumbo jumbo? I am intolerant of mushy thinking.  And I'm especially 
intolerant of the postmodern notions that any firm foundation for knowledge 
isn't possible, that "it's all relative" and that non-Western ideas somehow 
have a special place in some sort of exoneration of imperialist guilt (or 
something - it's usually very hard to determine WHAT such people are really 
saying).

<p>
At any rate, I see nothing wrong with christians attempting to convert Hindus 
and Jews.  As long as they don't use my tax dollars to do it, why shouldn't 
they be free to say whatever they want to whomever they want?  To me it seems 
very much like an advertising campaign designed to woo viewers from one 
situation comedy to another.  That they may spend a lot of money doing this 
sort of thing seems like a terrible waste, but, hey - it's their money; and 
since they are targeting people who are already religious, at least they're 
not increasing the net irrationality in the world.

<p>
(BTW, I haven't read Cornwell's book, but it looks very interesting.)

Cold comfort - but if this is the best one can hope for, let us rejoice in 
the airiness of the New Agers' heads!

I beg to differ with you in the strongest terms.  Cast (pun intended) your 
eyes upon a map of the subcontinent.  Notice the two counties to the 
northwest and northeast of India.  That will be Pakistan and Bangladesh.  Now 
turn your chronometer back 50 years.  You will see a bloody religious war 
between Hindus and Moslems.  Legions died.  It was a religious war, 
necessitating the formation of Pakistan and (eventually) Bangladesh.

<p>
Now look at last year's Indian newspapers.  You will see organized murder and 
pillage between Moslems and Hindus on both sides of the border.  Now turn 
your chronometer back 2500 to 3500 years ago.  You will see the Aryan 
invasion of the subcontinent and the religious and racial war against the 
indigenous Dravidian population.  This is chronicled in the Vedas - the 
"Hindu Old Testament".  The caste system - as bad as any social practice ever 
devised in the West - was the result of the religious and ethnic war between 
the Aryans and Dravidians.

<p>
As for China, look back 150 years to the Tai Ping rebellion, arguably the 
bloodiest war in human history.  Western histories of the Tai Pings 
concentrate on the political aspect of their threat to the Manchu throne, but 
the Tai Pings were first and foremost a religious sect.  Before that there 
were repeated waves of suppression of Buddhism after the Tang renaissance, 
and periodic nastiness against Taoists who had the impertinence to challenge 
the Confucian orthodoxy in any meaningful way.

<p>
The supposedly tolerant East is full of such examples.  The fiercest combat 
in mediaeval Japan was between warring sects of Buddhist monks.  Last month's 
bloody violence in East Timor was as much a religious war as anything else.
