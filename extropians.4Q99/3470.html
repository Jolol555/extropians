I have to agree with Robert regarding Geron as an investment:

<p>
Note that, despite an intraday surge, Geron closed below 14, and as I write 
this is at 13 1/16. As Robert noted, Geron has a history of this kind of 
price movement -- sudden big jumps on research news, followed by fast or 
gradual drops back to $10-11. I would love to own some Geron stock almost 
on principle, but haven't been able to bring myself to do it because I 
haven't seen any sign of products yet.

<p>

<p>
Geron has actually been a good shorting candidate. I feel embarrassed to 
admit that while I have made money on Geron, it was by shorting it right 
after one of these kinds of announcements. Sure enough, after a couple of 
months I had made something like 25% profit by buying back at a lower price.

<p>
<a href="3436.html#3470qlink3">&gt;If you have an IRA, Geron is probably a good bet to buy on market</a><br>

<p>
Again I agree with Robert.<a name="3513qlink1"> For goodness sake, don't try to buy it when it's 
just leapt up (unless it's on news of a genuine and promising *product*).</a> 
It *may* turn out to be a fabulous long-term investment, but high risk.

<p>
<a href="3436.html#3470qlink4">&gt;want to play it, you want to be very careful about their cash</a><br>
<i>&gt;reserves and their ability to raise additional capital.  Geron</i><br>
<i>&gt;has done much better than I would have expected (given the rest</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the biotech industry) in this regard.  You also have to watch</i><br>
<i>&gt;their drug development timeline.  They may be years away from</i><br>
<i>&gt;products and this is a prescription for bored investors.  Finally</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is always the potential that if they get really close to</i><br>
<i>&gt;something big pharma might snap them up.</i><br>

<p>
I'm quoting all of Robert's comments above since I think he is right on the 
mark and this bears paying attention to for those who would buy Geron just 
because they are doing wonderful research. Geron *has" recently raised 
enough cash ($15 million if I remember correctly) that will let them 
continue to operate at a loss for longer, but they are showing no sign of 
becoming profitable. I think there is a significant chance that a big 
pharma will snap them up (not necessarily bad for investors), especially 
now that Geron have their fingers in nuclear transfer, telomerase, and stem 
cells.

<p>
Sorry to join Robert in pouring some cold water on enthusiasm for investing 
in Geron, but these are important considerations. Believe me, I'll jump to 
buy Geron as soon as I am convinced of a reasonable probability of products.

<p>
In the meantime, I'm not complaining about my portfolio's 106% return so 
far this year. (Excuse the bragging, I just can't help myself!)

<p>
The InvestingNode list has been quiet for a long time. We could take this 
discussion there, and investigate other biotechs for potential, especially 
genomics companies that have run up lately or which may have bright futures 
-- Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Celera, etc. It's curious that on this list, 
amidst the discussion of advanced tech, we have very little discussion of 
profiting from our technological understanding...

<p>
Onward!
