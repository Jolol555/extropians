Consider, however, the price of pork.

<p>
Or the price of wheat.  According to farmers I talk to weekly (when I deliver 
their new tractors)...it's at a (perhaps?) record low.  

<p>
Now if the economic "law' of supply and demand holds that means there is 
insufficient demand.  And truly....the plains states (not to mention 
california) can grow a LOT of food.

<p>
This does not address the problem of  low per capita income in underdeveloped 
countries.  A big percentage of the global population does not have the money 
to buy the (available...at a low price..but too high for them) food.

<p>
Technologically it is and has been possible to support a larger population 
than now exists ...politicaly there's a problem..
