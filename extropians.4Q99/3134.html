  A second article in another Hawaiian paper on the tofu 
  study has been located. The papers published follow-ups 
  that sought to allay concerns about tofu, raising points 
  from the need for more research before coming to definitive 
  conclusions (obviously) to harming local tofu businesses.
  Here are the articles I've found on the tofu study:

  I contacted a researcher in a study I quoted showing that 
  the soy phytochemical genistein killed testicular cells. 
  I asked if those cells were normal or cancerous. He said 
  they were altered, but in other studies he has and/or is 
  working on, genistein is found to kill normal testicular 
  cells, yet increase their proliferation at lower doses.

<p>
  While healthy folks may not need chemicals increasing 
  or decreasing the number of their cells, that evidence 
  suggests that if there's a toxic level, there may also 
  be a safe and possibly beneficial level of soy. With 
  respect to reducing rates of cancer and other major 
  illness, research suggests that soy works. The FDA 
  recently approved the use of health claims on soy 
  products.[*] PubMed searches find numerous studies 
  (see: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed</a>) over the 
  years that demonstrate an anti-cancer effect of soy 
  phytochemicals, and their cytotoxic effect appears 
  generally to be highly specific to cancer cells.

<p>
  Of course, the possibility of a risk of brain atrophy 
  is not to be taken lightly. Of all organs, the brain 
  is arguably the most valuable and important to preserve.
