	When I first heard about the Prometheus Project a few years ago, I thought
it was a great concept with a lot of potential.  However, I seem to
remember reading on this list that it was defunct.  Regardless, given the
fact that there have been virtually no progress reports made available
(other than in a few specific areas), it is difficult to imagine Paul as
being able to attract investors.  For the project to be successful at this
stage of development, Paul needs to market its potential to an audience
which may have the means and desire to bring such an endeavour to fruition.
 I wish the Prometheus Project the best of fortunes.
