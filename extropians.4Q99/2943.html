<a name="2971qlink1">	Here's a random thought: when genetic engineering becomes relatively
common and parents can select most of the genetic makeup of their
soon-to-be progeny, how many parents --gay or straight-- would</a> choose their
<a name="2971qlink2">offspring's sexual orientation as being</a> homosexual?  I can imagine that
very few heterosexual parents would choose the opposite orientation for
their children, but I also wonder how many homosexual parents would choose
their children's sexual orientation to be the same.  In the case of the
latter, would homosexual parents choose heterosexuality for their children
to prevent social nihilism and possible cultural unacceptance?
