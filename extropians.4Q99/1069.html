<p>
A very good point.  The decay of a carbon atom *in* the DNA
could have a much greater effect than a K40 atom nearby releasing
a large amount of ionizing radiation (since most of the ionization
effect is absorbed by the water molecules).  However if the K40
abundance or "ionizing potential" can can produce more mutations
than the average C14 abundance, then it is the more dangerous element.

<i>&gt; </i><br>
It depends entirely on the abundance of C14 in the DNA vs. the
abundance of ionization effects from solvated K40 (or other
radioactive isotopes) compared with their half lives and
ionizing potentials (and distances from "critical" targets).
This isn't a simple equation.

<p>
However, my general impression is that in the "real world"
the carcinogenesis effects are something like:
<p>
   plutonium &gt;&gt; radium &gt;&gt; radon &gt; K40 &gt; C14

<p>
So I suspect this balances out in terms of the doses and
"radioactive efficacy" of the atoms one is typically exposed to.
But to really discuss it we need hard numbers.
