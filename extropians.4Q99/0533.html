<i>&gt;care of themselves.</i><br>

<p>
Of course not.  I said they are there by choice.

<p>
<a href="0515.html#0533qlink2">&gt;They are there because the have social problems.  They</a><br>
<i>&gt;either don't want help or they drive away people who could help them.</i><br>

<p>
And so why help them?  If they don't want help then don't help them.  If 
they drive people away, then don't help them.  Now, if they drive people a 
way because they stink and they ask you to help rid them of this problem 
then you can help them.

I doubt it.  Having lived with hundreds of suicidal people and can say that 
is not true.  Most people play the game.  I've talked with so many suicidal 
people who say "I'm glad to have been saved from myself" because that is 
what is expected of them.  They are looking for a 'norm', to belong, and by 
saying those things they don't realy mean they try to fit in.  It gets them 
out of the hospital faster.  Of course, at least 75% of these people try to 
commit suicide again.  You can say it's a clinical depression and in there 
genes so they realy don't mean it.  Well, you can say all our thoughts are 
clinical and its in our genes.  That's all the better reason to let them 
kill themselves if they wish.  I have seen a dramatic increase of retarded 
adults and children in just the last few years.  Are we going to breed 
humanity into a retarded species?  People who try to commit suicide and fail 
and later say they are glad they didn't, well the ment it at the time and 
had they succeeded they wouldn't be alive to think other wise.  They are 
dead, there life to them having never meant anything because they aren't 
alive to preceive it.  They don't exist, they don't matter.

<p>
I'm not saying you can't help people.  It wouldn't be a very fun society if 
nobody did.  I'm saying don't force your help onto people who don't want it.

<p>
As for your hungry dog scenario.  The dog is hungry but will bite you if you 
feed it, so you drop a steak around the corner and the dog happily gobbles 
it up not knowing it was you who gave it to him.  That's fine.  You didn't 
make the dog do anything he didn't want to do.  You didn't kidnap him and 
take him home so you could care for him for his own good.
