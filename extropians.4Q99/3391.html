<i>&gt;  fiction.  There's no commerce of any kind in the book.  And it's not just </i><br>

it", 
<br>
<a href="3389.html#3391qlink3">&gt;  it's actively denied as part of the story.  (Communal living, communal </a><br>
<i>&gt;  values, you know.)  No buying and selling, but everyone always has plenty </i><br>
<i>&gt;  of water, food, air, and shelter, except when a crisis is happening.</i><br>

<a name="3399qlink1">I share your opinion of that element of the books -- in fact, it was such an 
appalling aspect of the material I couldn't finish them.</a>

<a href="3389.html#3391qlink4">&gt;  There's no way a society could exist under those conditions, let alone </a><br>
<i>&gt;  grow, and evolve.  Does the "law and governance" crowd expect supplies to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  arrive everywhere by magic, or are they confronting these problems?</i><br>

<p>
There are a couple of posters that have a clue about such matters, sort ot.  
But there's also such a lot of incredible naivete that I've given up 
contributing, for the most part.  It's sad, really.
