<a href="0122.html#0125qlink1">&gt; &gt; I for one think its not an extropic way. It is a transhumanist way. The</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; difference being that this is more of a borganistic idea than an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; extropian one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hmm, even if it [the surveillance] is private and distributed? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Surely that could count as an expression of spontaneous</i><br>
<i>&gt; order?</i><br>

"Privacy" is one of those tough questions of libertarian thought.
Some claim it as a right, but purists would disagree.  Recording
someone's actions in public or on private land other than eirs is
/not/ a trespass.  Even if there is some "right" to privacy, there
is certainly no entitlement to it: no one should be coerced not
to videotape and record anything ey pleases, record phone calls
ey is a participant in, use personal information given to em for
any purpose, ask any question on a job application, etc.

<a name="0140qlink1">The only reason most libertarians think privacy is a good thing
is that the major snoop is government, and we want them to have
less power.  I have to agree with Brin, though, that the way to
fight back is to point the cameras back at them, not turn them off.</a>
