<p>
But they could be, and there is no good reason not to, other than
believing that robots now don't actually care whether they work or not,
so there is no real labor/leisure tradeoff for them.

<p>
You could sensibly talk about a labor/leisure tradeoff for animals,
who do care how much they work, so a beast of burden like an ox does
"labor".

<p>
There are actually few issues in robot/human relations that don't
come up in animal/human relations.  If you're clear-headed in dealing
with animals, you're probably mostly ready for robots.
