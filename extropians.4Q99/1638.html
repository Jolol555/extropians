<i>&gt; &gt;scientists!</i><br>

<p>
Actually New Agers can come in so many forms and I see many individuals and 
groups being thrown in with them arbitrarily.  I could see some people 
saying the Extropian Institute is a "new age" group! lol

<p>
I would like to know what the problem is about social scientists??  What is 
wrong with psychologists and sociologists?  I have a sociology professor who 
went off on me when I called sociology a "soft" science!

<p>
I read with interest Greg Burch's post about coming across a new age 
newsletter packed with advertising.  We have a popular one up here in 
Alaska.  I do not know how much the two relate but ours does some some 
redeeming value with usually one or two articles at least about human 
relationships or nutrition that are beneficial.  A person must be careful 
because there is plenty of snake oil being advertised also.

<p>
Another good example is the "Tools for Exploration" catalog which is full of 
"peak performance" products such as brain machines, biofeedback devices, 
nutritional supplements and anything else you could imagine.  Some of it is 
classic snake oil but there is much there in my view that could be good and 
in fact is the sort of thing Anders might recommend in his vast Transhuman 
site.

<p>
As for physicists and evangelicals uniting it just might happen for perhaps 
brief periods.  I don't see evangelicals and extropians uniting on anything 
soon.  In fact I expect Hal Lindsey or Bob Larson to be writing a book 
denouncing transhumanism anytime!!  You will know you have arrived when that 
happens.  Moody press would lose half their revenue if they stopped 
publishing books against Mormons.
<br>
Extropianism could be their next cash cow.  Max More and the rest of you 
will make for great antagonists in their story.  I see Bob Larson 
interviewing Max and Natasha and acting horrified each time they make a 
statement.  Then he will sell it to his listeners for hundred dollar 
donations.  I will say to the man's credit he does help out alot of really 
messed up teens who have nowhere else to turn.


<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
