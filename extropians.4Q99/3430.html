  LOOKING FOR "EARLY SCHIZOPHRENIA" IN CHILDREN

<p>
  MAY INCREASE RISK OF IATROGENIC POLYPHARMACY 

<p>
  (c) 12/8/99 Ian Williams Goddard<br>

<p>
  The New York Times (12/7/99) [1] reports that a possible
  new psychiatric diagnostic agenda for children may be to
  identify "early warning signs" of schizophrenia that are 
  to be treated with antipsychotic drugs. Research funded 
  in part by the drug company Eli Lilly is attempting to 
  see if antipsychotic drugs can reduce the incidence of 
  full-blown schizophrenia if given to "high-risk" subjects 
  while they are still children. With the ability to cause 
  permanent brain damage and disfiguring conditions such as 
  tardive dyskinesia, antipsychotic drugs, also known as
  neuroleptics, are the most harmful psychiatric drugs. [2]

<p>
  Also of concern regarding an "early schizophrenic" focus 
  in childhood diagnosis is that the drug Ritalin, which 
  is being prescribed to millions of children, is known to 
  produce symptoms that mimic schizophrenia. [3] One drug 
  study even found that Ritalin "induces a psychopathology 
  that seems to mimic schizophrenic psychosis more closely 
  than that induced by amphetamines and cocaine." [4] About 
  the ability of psychostimulants such as Ritalin to mimic 
  symptoms of schizophrenia, Peter Breggin, M.D., states:

<p>
    "All of the stimulants, including Cylert, can cause 
    psychoses that mimic schizophrenia... These druginduced
     psychoses look so much like schizophrenia 
    that a strong argument has been made that stimulant 
    abuse sometimes causes 'chronic schizophrenia.'(43)" [5] 

<p>
  Since doctors often prescribe multiple drugs (polypharmacy), 
  and since an illness treated by one drug may be caused by 
  another (iatrogenic polypharmacy), the potential exists that 
  Ritalin-induced schizophrenia might be treated with even more
  dangerous mind-altering drugs. As Breggin observes: "Because 
  Ritalin is promoted as relatively free of adverse effects, 
  the development of a severe mental disturbance can be 
  mistaken for the surfacing of further 'mental illness.'" [6] 

<p>
  The potential for iatrogenic polypharmacy could arise as a 
  result of any "early schizophrenia treatment" agenda unless 
  all doctors are aware of all adverse effects of stimulants 
  and are willing to take a child off them to see if symptoms 
  subside before they risk prescribing potentially braindamaging
   neuroleptics, and yet psychosis has been reported 
  during withdrawal from long-term Ritalin use. [7] Chances 
  are some doctors will drug first and ask questions later.

<p>
  Quoted below are excerpts from a study that found Ritalin 
  produced a dose-dependent dysfunction in nonschizophrenics 
  that "'mimics' schizophrenic psychopathology." The range of 
  doses in the study intersects Ritalin's therapeutic range. 
  The study used Ritalin to test a hypothesis about the nature 
  of an on-set schizophrenic dysfunction. The fact that Ritalin 
<br>
  (methylphenidate) was chosen reflects the fact that it is a <br>
  drug of choice for modeling schizophrenic psychopathology.

<p>
   Here then are important excerpts from that study:

     Methylphenidate-Induced Information Processing
     Dysfunction in Nonschizophrenic Patients

     David L. Braff, MD, Leighton Huey, MD 

     Department of Psychiatry, University 
     of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093. 

     "Schizophrenic patients have significant deficits 
     in a wide range of attentional and information 
     processing tasks. It is hypothesized that
     catecholamine (eg, dopamine) overactivity may 
     induce and that antipsychotic medications may 
     reverse these attentional deficits." ...

     "This experiment was designed to test whether 
     systemic administration of the dopamine agonist 
     methylphenidate hydrochloride [Ritalin], in 
     nonschizophrenic patients, would induce an 
     information processing dysfunction similar to 
     the dysfunction typically seen in schizophrenic 
     patients in the visual backward masking task."[8]

     "These results show that methylphenidate, which 
     increases central catecholaminergic activity, 
     induces dose-dependent deficits in information 
     processing similar to those seen in schizophrenic 
     patients. ...this experiment used a combination 
     of psychophysical tasks and pharmacological 
     probes and is a novel illustration of how 
     stimulant challenges can induce the type of 
     information processing dysfunction seen in 
     schizophrenic spectrum patients." ...

     "...the higher dose of methylphenidate induced
     significantly more information processing 
     disruption, indicating a dose-dependant effect 
     that needs further investigation." [IAN: The 
     low dose in this study was 0.5 mg/kg, the high 
     dose was 1 mg/kg, oral. Typical therapeutic 
     doses of Ritalin range from .3 to .7 mg/kg [9]]

     "...we assume that normal humans operate at 
     a highly efficient threshold level for many 
     attentional operations, so that even modest 
     impairments of these critical functions can 
     result in cognitive or symptomatic impairment. 
     ... In this context, our drug treatment effect 
     represents a striking, methylphenidate-induced 
     impairment of the normal mechanisms by which 
     information is processed in humans." ...

     "[M]ethylphenidate, possibly through its aminergic-
     enhancing properties, 'mimics' schizophrenic 
     psychopathology by inducing specific, time-
     linked backward visual masking abnormalities."
