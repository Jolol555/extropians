<a name="3429qlink1">Well, I'm not so sure.  Every time I think about the book it
brings up those images of Vlad the Impaler and his poor victims
back during the dark ages.  Then that leads to the recognition
that D.B. is from Australia where they sent "criminals".  Now,
<a name="3409qlink1">seriously, I've been to Australia, and while it isn't "</a>Paradise"
it is quite a long way from "Hell on Earth".  Come on... You have
to belive the English justice system was going a bit soft...

Kind of like being "uploaded" as a sub-sub-SI where you have
3 minutes of work to do each millennia and the rest of your
time off you have the run of the holo-VR.

<p>
Now in contrast, Vlad was a *serious* fellow, no vacation
punishments for his victims.

<p>
If the SPIKE is describing the "criminals" sent to Australia
path of reality, then I'll be glad to sign up.  If the SPIKE
is describing the VtI path of reality then I may take a
spectator position.

<p>
Disclaimers: I haven't read the SPIKE, though I will someday, and
<a name="3409qlink2">I'll lay open claim to having a bit of fun at Damien's</a> expense
with no harm intended.
