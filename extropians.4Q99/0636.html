The question is how much this threat would be reduced by a merger.  Merged
threats, such as Apple offered bundling its OS with Motorola chips,
would still be feasible.</a>

<a name="0840qlink2">Actually, the same analysis applies if there is *any* market power.
In this case, D(P) represents the effective demand each firm faces
taking the other firms into account.  Unless there is an exact price
threshold, such that sales are zero above that threshold and 100%
of the market below that threshold, a firm has some market power.</a>

<p>
I have a paper in front of me arguing that we should encourage/allow
movie producers to merge with theatre firms.  Firms in these industries
have enough market power that merging could lower prices by up to 30%
and therefore increase sales by a factor of two, or so this paper says.
