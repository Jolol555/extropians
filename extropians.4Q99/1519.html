Coincidentally, germane to the recent thread, this sleep loss link to 
inhibition of Life Extension.

I am very guilty...

My candle it burns at both ends
<br>
It will not last the night
<br>
But ah my foes
<br>
and ah my friends
<br>
It gives a lovely light

"Too Little Sleep May Accelerate Aging
<br>
Regularly catching only a few hours of sleep can hinder metabolism and 
hormone production in a way that is similar to the effects of aging and 
the early stages of diabetes.

<p>
Chronic sleep loss may speed the onset or increase the severity of 
age-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, 
obesity, and memory loss. The researchers showed that just one week of 
sleep deprivation altered subject's hormone levels and their capacity to 
metabolize carbohydrates. People who trade sleep for work or play may 
get used to it and feel less fatigued.

<p>
During sleep-deprivation, the researchers found, the men's blood sugar 
levels took 40% longer to drop following a high-carbohydrate meal, 
compared with the sleep-recovery period. Their ability to secrete and 
respond to the hormone insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar, 
dropped by 30%. These changes echo the effects of insulin resistance, a 
precursor to type 2 diabetes. In addition, the sleep-deprived men had 
higher nighttime concentrations of the hormone cortisol, which also 
helps regulate blood sugar, and lower levels of thyroid-stimulating 
hormone. These raised cortisol levels mimic levels that are often seen 
in older people, and may be involved in age-related insulin resistance 
and memory loss.

<p>
Sleep debts are sort of like stress. Most sleep-deprivation research has 
focused on what it does to the brain, but it is likely that sleep has 
many functions.  In the study, subjects' blood sugar and hormone 
concentrations were restored after the sleep-recovery period.

<p>
Earlier research has shown that in developed countries, the average 
night's sleep has grown shorter since the beginning of the century, from 
9 hours to 7.5 hours. Many people give up sleep to make room for work 
and leisure. An adequate amount of sleep is as important as an adequate
amount of exercise. Sleeping is not a sin.

<p>
COMMENT: This topic is particularly important as we prepare for the 
clock shift next weekend. This is a very important study published out 
of my hometown at the University of Chicago right down the block from 
where I went to medical school. I think most of us do not fully 
appreciate the value of a full night's sleep. This article nicely 
demonstrates the incredible disruption of our finely balanced hormones 
that results when we get less sleep than we were designed to. I believe 
that seven hours is an absolute minimum for most all of us, and most of 
us would benefit from closer to 9 hours.  The researchers did find that 
sleep debt could be made up by spending longer than the normal eight 
hours in bed, which seemed to return the body's chemical balance to 
normal. Another sleep hygiene principle is that you should be in bed by 
10PM. I think in the winter months 9 PM is more likely to be a better 
time if you have to wake up early to go to work. I have been 
experimenting with 9 PM as a bedtime and find it to provide a great deal 
of rest and I wake up feeling far more refreshed. I will attempt to keep 
this pattern as I usually get up at 4:30 and I believe 7 1/2 is the bare 
minimum amount of sleep one should get.
