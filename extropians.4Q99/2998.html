&lt;&lt; My point is that 
<br>
 killing yourself (permanently) is stupid because it robs 
 you of a potentially infinite amount of "pleasure points" 
<br>
<a href="2906.html#2998qlink1"> (pleasure being the interim meaning of life because all </a><br>
 our goals are based on the pleasure-discomfort principle, 
 the carrot and the stick). Why do we think that a certain
 action or goal is good? Because it makes us *feel good*. 
 Therefore, the logical thing to do is to stay alive and 
 be pleasured whenever possible until you find something 
 more meaningful, if there is such a thing at all. &gt;&gt;

<p>
It is illogical to kill oneself if you accept the following two premises:

<p>
1.) Pleasure is a sufficient reason for remaining alive.

<p>
2.) The future will not be filled only with suffering.

<p>
I think many would accept the first, but there are many pessimists or people 
depressed or in despair who would not accept the second premise.  Personally, 
I accept both (with my own caveats and variations).
