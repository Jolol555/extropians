<a href="0163.html#0168qlink1">&gt;And here's the summary from the patent for his UV laser taser:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt;SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The principal object of the instant invention is to provide a non-lethal </i><br>
<i>&gt;immobilizing weapon for use by military or law enforcement personnel. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A second object of this invention is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing </i><br>
<i>&gt;weapon which is inherently safe in its operation. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
So far, so good...

<p>
<i>&gt;A third object of this invention is to provide a non-lethal weapon which is </i><br>
<i>&gt;capable of temporarily immobilizing a target subject without causing pain, </i><br>
<a name="0183qlink2"><a href="0163.html#0168qlink2">&gt;shock, disorientation, or loss of consciousness. </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
This one seems an impossibility. I have never encountered any electrical
stimulation of the human body that did not entail at least one of these
effects. The whole idea of a stunner is to STUN...or cause loss of
</a>
orientation and control.

<p>
<i>&gt;A fourth object of this invention is to provide a non-lethal weapon which is </i><br>
<i>&gt;capable of temporarily immobilizing a target subject without his being aware </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the cause. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0291qlink1"><a name="0183qlink3">Stealthy stun? Why would this be a good thing? Once a person is stunned,</a>
who cares if they know what hit them? They are out of the fight.</a>

<p>
Unless, there are darker motivations than stopping a suspect - something
like knocking someone out and then subjecting them to procedures they would
later have no memory of?

<p>
Maybe this is how the saucer people are getting their victims :)

<p>
<a name="0183qlink4"><a href="0163.html#0168qlink3">&gt;A fifth object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon whose range</a><br>
is 
<br>
<a href="0163.html#0168qlink4">&gt;substantially greater than prior related weapons that use wires or</a><br>
conductive 
<br>
<i>&gt;liquid streams. </i><br>

<p>
This is the big problem, as I pointed out in my earlier post. Any stun
technology that cannot work over more than a few meters is going to be of
very limited use.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A sixth object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon which can be </i><br>
<a href="0163.html#0168qlink5">&gt;fired from a remote location without requiring the physical impact of solid </a><br>
<i>&gt;or liquid matter upon the target. </i><br>

<p>
No projectiles - no reloading, no mess to clean up. Good goal.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A seventh object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon which can</i><br>
be 
<br>
<a href="0163.html#0168qlink6">&gt;directed continuously and swept across an indefinitely large number of</a><br>
target 
<br>
<i>&gt;subjects. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0291qlink2"><a name="0183qlink5">I have doubts about how much dwell time is needed to successfully</a> put
someone out of commission. A slight shock might take the fight out of
rioters, however - but it might also just make them angrier..</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;An eighth object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon which can </i><br>
<a href="0163.html#0168qlink7">&gt;rapidly be fired toward a specific location on a single target subject, or</a><br>
to 
<br>
<a href="0163.html#0168qlink8">&gt;a specific target subject among many because of the highly directional</a><br>
nature 
<br>
<a href="0163.html#0168qlink9">&gt;of its current-conducting means. </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0291qlink3">I still have doubts about how much voltage would be required. Even</a> in low
pressure gases, it takes kilovolts to light (glow discharge) a tube a meter
or two long. 100 meters in air at STP still needs megavolts, not the 600
volts mentioned later in the patent.

<p>
<a href="0163.html#0168qlink10">&gt;A ninth object is to provide a non-lethal, immobilizing weapon which has a </a><br>
<i>&gt;significantly longer service life than prior related weapons. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I was not aware that the Taser has a limited life. UV lasers can be
expected to cost much more and require periodic replacement, although in
this kind of service they might last the lifetime of the stunner.

<p>
The citations about ionization and electron density may be true, but do not
really give a good feel for how much electrical power would be needed to
strike the arc and maintain it.

<p>
<a name="0183qlink6">A glow discharge in air at STP requires an enormous electric field, on the
order of megavolts per meter. The laser provides the initial ionization,
but unless it is a CW laser, the conducted charge must maintain the path.
Hence my earlier comments about lightning.</a>

<p>
An aside: Directed lightning strikes have been produced using lasers to
create an ionized channel. Experiments in Japan have shown that lightning
can be drawn to a selected collection point, thereby protecting antenna
towers and electrical distribution equipment nearby. So the idea of a
UV-produced conduction channel is workable.

<p>
<a name="0183qlink7">I have a feeling that this is one of those 'ivory tower' ideas that are
proposed, get a lot of press, and then fade away without producing a
workable device.</a>
