 &gt; Surely it is least appropriate to judge people on this list by the

<a href="0070.html#0227qlink1">&gt;Well, I do.  First of all, Robin is far more insightful that Eliezer in the</a><br>

<p>
Hmm... were you aware I was once an artificial intelligence researcher? :-)

<p>
I'm actually not that big a fan of the Ph.D.  I think a much better
fast indication of someone's expertize is their publication record.
I don't know about Kathryn, but Anders and Hal have both written high
quality articles.  And I think Amara has as well.

<p>
Of course if one spends a lot of time reading the email posts of people
one might conclude they are sharp even if they have never published anything.
But that's an expensive process, and people reasonably want to have faster
ways to evaluate people.  Checking for a Ph.D. is indeed fast, but one
can reasonably complain it is unreasonable to ask people to get one just
to make it easier for you to judge them.  Publication records seem a
reasonable intermediate choice, requiring much less effort to get and
still giving a good signal about expertize.  Yes of course there are biases
regarding who gets published where, but I don't see a better option.

<p>
So if you are chaffing at being ignored when you think yourself
sufficiently expert, consider just publishing a few things.
(And consider publishing them in the Journal of Transhumanism. :-)
And, honestly, you may find that the process of trying to publish
reveals that you are not as expert as you thought.
