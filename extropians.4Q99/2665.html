<p>
  IAN: I'm also a tofu-eating vegetarian and 
  very concerned by that study!! However, I'm 
  inclined to believe it's accurate BECAUSE the 
  soy-phytochemical genistein has been shown to 
  fight cancer, and it has a property that many
  anti-cancer drugs have, which is reducing the 
  rate of DNA synthesis. That property is great 
  for reducing the proliferation of cells and 
  promoting their death; unfortunately the 
  evidence cited suggests the cytotoxic 
  properties of genistein are nonspecific.

<p>
  DNA synthesis is a critical attribute of the
<pre>
  life cycle of a cell. Here's some data on that:
  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Lab/1580/cycle2.gif">http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Lab/1580/cycle2.gif</a> 
  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Lab/1580/cycle.html">http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Lab/1580/cycle.html</a> 
</pre>
  Again, research shows genistein reduces DNA synthesis. 
  There appear to be many health benefits of soybean
  products, however, I believe that brain atrophy 
  is not an acceptable trade off unless genistein 
  treats an otherwise untreatable fatal illness.

<p>
  Evidence also suggests that curcumin may kill
  cancer cells. If true, I wonder how? It is
  possible that our explorations into health 
  foods could run into unforeseen disasters.
  A good strategy is probably to eat a wide
  variety of foods, then if one should prove
  harmful, you haven't been overexposed to it.
