STEVIE WONDER WANTS TO SEE!: Superstar musician Stevie Wonder has announced
that he will undergo an operation that could restore his sight. The BBC
reports that Wonder told fellow worshippers in a Detroit church that the
operation  "helps the blind to become
<br>
sighted with the help of some sort of chip." Wonder, 49, lost his sight
within hours of birth, and hopes to have the operation at the Wilmer Eye
Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
