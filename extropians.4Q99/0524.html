<p>
That is my point.  It may not be logical for parents to love their
children, but it is human nature.  And you can't change human nature.  And
saying that people shouldn't care about whether young people in their
community are being properly educated, may be logical, but that goes
against human nature also.

<p>
Don't argue against natural human impulses.  Instead point out the harm
that forcing 'education' on young people does.

<p>
Yes it is.  But most people like that get off the street rather quickly.

<p>
It may not be a conscious decision.  You may want to feed a hungry dog, but
if that dog looks like he might bite you, you probably will give the food
to another creature instead.  And nobody would accuse you of being
indifferent to the dogs needs.

<p>
<a href="0519.html#0524qlink4">&gt; &gt; That is true. The idea that everybody can be helped is a fantasy.</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But it is a fantasy that many people believe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It isn't a fantasy.  The problem is with the belief that "help"</i><br>
<i>&gt; has a universal form.  In one situation "helping" a person may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be to assist in the termination of their life, in another situation</i><br>
<i>&gt; "helping" may be to fight tooth and claw to prevent them from doing so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The fantasy is that there are "universal" answers.</i><br>

<p>
People tend to underestimate how easy it is to solve problems.  Certainly,
very few problem can be solved by turning over vast sums of money to social
workers with below average IQ's.  Or allowing lawyers to make all the
decisions.
