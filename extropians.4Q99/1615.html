According to today's New York Times several important advances will be announced
in the scientific journals in the next few weeks. A long time ago, way back in July,
a molecular switch was made for the first time, however it had limited usefulness
because it could only switch once. In about 2 weeks a Yale chemist, Mark Reed,
will publish an article in Science describing a molecular switch that can be turned on
and off indefinitely . Of course you'd still have to wire all those switches together
to make a computer, but in a separate development Hewlett Packard found a
easy way to make a grid of conductive lines 10 atoms wide and 50 atoms apart.
Reed must be a busy man, he also said he will make an announcement on
December 6 at the International Electron Device conference in Washington about
using his molecular switches for RAM memory, he won't release details about
his memory device until then.

<p>
The NYT quotes a bunch of experts about the very recent developments,
they said some interesting stuff:

<p>
"We're on the scent, and we know the fox is out there."<br>

<p>
"It feels like we're a year before the invention of the transistor."<br>

<p>
"In two to five years you will begin to see functioning circuits which<br>
 are of recognizable utility."

<p>
"If you can make computers as easily as photographic film a<br>
 lot of companies are going to be wondering what they're doing
 with their 15 billion dollar fabrication plants".

<p>
One remark would certainly catch Eliezer's eye, Reed said:

<p>
"This should scare the pants off anyone working in silicon.<br>
 It will be dirt cheap and it will create a discontinuity."
