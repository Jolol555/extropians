<a href="2249.html#2263qlink1">&gt; I thought it was generally agreed that survivability was a stabilizing</a><br>
<i>&gt; trait, not a destabilizing one.</i><br>

<p>
Survivability is different from opportunity to retaliate, which is what
you're describing.

<p>
Low survivability:  When opportunity to retaliate is high, and
survivability is low, you get mutually assured destruction.  When
opportunity to retaliate is low and survivability is low, first strike
becomes effective.

<p>
High survivability:  However, if opportunity to retaliate is high and
survivability is high, war may erupt, rather than mutually assured
destruction.  High survivability with low opportunity to retaliate doesn't
make any sense.

<p>
<a name="2266qlink1">Thus, (surprise!) having a low survivability is a necessary but not a
sufficient condition for nuclear stability in a MAD world.  To get MAD
stability you need low survivability AND ample opportunity to retaliate.</a>
