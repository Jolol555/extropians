<a name="1040qlink1"><a href="1018.html#1033qlink1">&gt;"Damage" is a tricky word. Have feral children damaged brains? Certain </a><br>
<i>&gt;parts never developed well during the critical periods of development (for </i><br>
<i>&gt;example language in some cases), emotional neglect and abuse have </i><br>
<i>&gt;programmed very dysfunctional behavior programs and reactions into their </i><br>
<i>&gt;limbic systems and deprived environments have likely decreased overall cell </i><br>
<i>&gt;and synapse count. I would say they have damaged brains, their brains are </i><br>
<i>&gt;not just different, they work worse than "normal" brains. The same goes for </i><br>
<i>&gt;antisocial personality disorder, it is not just an alternate normative </i><br>
<i>&gt;system, it is a syndrome of personality and behavior changes that usually </i><br>
<i>&gt;leads to serious problems for the person and impairs their decision making </i><br>
<i>&gt;ability.</i><br>

<p>
I think I'll just have to meet a few of these people suffering from 
antisocial personality disorder and find out for myself.</a>  I've been reading 
<a name="1040qlink2">a lot about this ever since this thread started and none of my reading has 
me convinced it's a disorder.</a>  Perhaps there are some documentation on the 
<a name="1040qlink3">web covering brain development differences?  I find it very hard to swallow 
that the frontal lobe is not developed fully or damaged in some way to cause 
</a>this.<a name="1040qlink4">  Have there been any cases of a person developing antisocial 
personality disorder as an adult after a head injury?  As extreme</a> as 
sociopathy?
