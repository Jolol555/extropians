The December issue of Business 2.0 has a cover feature regarding the next 
1000 years. Of course they haven't a clue what things will be like in 1000 
years, and I don't especially recommend buying the issue; just have a quick 
browse and note Ray Kurzweil's extropic contribution.

<a name="3519qlink1">The best part (and this might only be subscribers--I haven't checked the 
newsstands) is an accompanying booklet called "Brainticklers II: Beyond 
Y2K--Questions for New Millennium and the Year 3000."</a> The year 3000 seems 
ridiculously distant for the ideas involved but there are plenty of 
questions that stir up transhumanist reflections in the reader. This 
booklet looks like it was inspired (to put it in charitable terms) but 
Gregory Stock's Book of Questions.
