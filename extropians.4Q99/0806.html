<a href="0745.html#0806qlink1">&gt;&gt;&gt;All history we know of to date will pale in comparison to what happens</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;when the singularity hits because the rate of change will be so much</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;more rapid. [. . .]</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Why only refer to our history from the perspective of the Singularitiy are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Internet Time. I think Vernor would be surprised by this -:)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is true that we cannot ignore previous developments because we foresee</i><br>
<i>&gt;(or have experienced) a comparatively significantly more dramatic</i><br>
<i>&gt;development.<a name="0842qlink1">  Much or all of what we perceive as transhumanism has in a way</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply been a part of the history of science and technology.</i><br>

<p>
Could be, but I'm not so sure. What we perceive as transhumanists is an
understanding and knowledge of science and technology.  Our psychological
makeup plays a primary part in our desire to learn and our ability to
accept changes which affects our transhumanism.  where science and
technology play a principal part is in the evolution of transhumans.</a>

<p>
On this subject of Robert's post, "waiting for the future to happen" is a
"play" on the play Waiting for Godot and, as such, metaphoric.  As
cryonicists, it could be a long wait for Robert, Robin and me (although
it's a toss-up whether coming out ahead of the pack is better than waiting
for massive Enlightenment.)<a name="0842qlink2">   Robert's response was on target to us both,
but I can't find it because you changed the Subject line.</a> 

<p>
As I recall, Eliezer probably correctly interpreted Robert's point best,
while I was thinking of historical events. Greg Burch's comment was a nice
symbiosis in his phrase "A  breeding ground for ideas and a network of
innovators."
