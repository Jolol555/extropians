Maybe the answer to this is in how we chose to restructure ourselves in
the future.

<p>
Right now we tend to be a bunch of lazy biological animals.  A billion
years of evolution has ingrained in us a predilection for conserving
energy between meals and enjoying relaxation.  Modern cultural
programming is mostly in favor of the opposite - work like hell and get
ahead.  Hence civilization's discontent. 

<p>
When it is possible for me to thoroughly re-enigneer my wants and
desires, I might choose to do away with the "rest and relaxation =
pleasure" response altogether and replace it with an unchecked
preference for growth and extension of myself.   Then I could have the
best of both worlds - continuous advancement and constant pleasure.
