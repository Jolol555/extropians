Not Hannibal Lecter.

Just kidding. Years ago I was rather attracted to Hans Eysenck's notion
that much bad behaviour was a side consequence of some people having
unusually high limbic thresholds, so they needed to SCREAM AND SHOUT AND
SMASH to get the same neurochemical hit that sensitive nellies like me
derive from bathing in asses' milk and reading Proust. Presumably a
generation of Ritalin prescriptions for ADD and other naughty kids was the
practical outcome of such theories. Not all that successful, I gather, but
maybe that's because the instrument was too blunt to test/implement the
theory. I guess Tim or Anders could say something salient here.
