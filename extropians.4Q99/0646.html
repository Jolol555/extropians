<a href="0630.html#0646qlink1">&gt;In most schools the pay a teacher receives is not based on how well he</a><br>
<i>&gt;teaches but on how many degrees he has, and not just any degree,</i><br>
<i>&gt;only particularly silly ones in something caused "education" count.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This leads to absurdities such as a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry not </i><br>
<i>&gt;being</i><br>
<i>&gt;allowed to teach high school chemistry. The policy also maximizes the wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;thing, not smart kids but just the amount of parchment a teacher possesses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm almost embarrassed to point out the obvious but the only way to tell a </i><br>
<i>&gt;good</i><br>
<i>&gt;teacher from a bad one is to see how well they teach. Have all students in</i><br>
<i>&gt;a given grade take a standardized test, this would really be a test of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the teachers not the students. Teachers with students in the top 20%</i><br>
<i>&gt;would get a raise, those in the top 5% would get a big raise, those in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;top 1% would get rich, those in the bottom 20% would get a pay cut ,</i><br>
<i>&gt;those in the bottom 5% would get a big pay cut  and those in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bottom 1% would get fired.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sure the National Education Association would really hate this</i><br>
<i>&gt;policy and that's pretty good evidence it's a good idea</i><br>

<p>
Excellent idea for a way schools can stay competitive.
