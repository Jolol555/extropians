Also, it is to remember that however large Microsoft, spawn of IBM, and Intel,
might collectively be, which is large, there are a wide variety of
competitors.  In the context of a war, Microsoft is well entrenched and it's
supply (distribution) network is large and powerful.  Linux's supporters tend
to have more heart behind their cause.

<p>
For any of their failings, Microsoft makes some good software.  Ten years ago,
they made Word and Excel that worked on Windows and Macintosh, then and now the
prevalent personal computer operating systems.  The personal computer, besides
techy hobbyist and professional use, was and is in many ways a replacement and
extension of the typewriter, the officeplace icon until the advent (bad word)
of PCs.  Obviously a huge non-niche market is software that replicates that
functionality.  On that note, note that neither of the behemoths in question
manufactures printers.

<p>
I use Windows software and prefer it to Macintosh and UNIX software.  Largely
that is due to familiarity.  When I started using PCs, besides game-oriented
Commodore dabbling as a teen, it was  Macintosh environment, with good things.
About ten years ago, there was AppleTalk, PostScript printers, QuarkXPress,
Excel and Word, each of which exist today, although I hear its called
OpenTransport.  The thing about that is that these kinds of software have been
around and been solidified for these ten years, only making bigger.  Some might
argue that competitors have risen and fallen, and even that it would be
difficult for any replacement set to gain adequate market share for
survivability, viz. Sun StarOffice acquisition in light of Corel or Lotus.  At
any rate, most types of software for personal use are available without porting
on the Windows OS.  It is certainly true that UNIX software is better in ways
for server as opposed to workstation use, and overall better for this purpose.
My Linux machine sits and runs for weeks with a full complement of server
software and a kernel I compiled myself.

<p>
Alexander Bell developed the telephone.  In the fast and loose freewheeling
days of early telephone deployment, over ten or twenty years the infrastructure
was made for thousands of people to talk on the phone.  In the last five years,
millions have turned on to the Internet.

<p>
Microsoft has paved itself a way into large scale use, and economically and
obviously they would to preserve and expand that venue, and it is a lucrative
one, and as it is software, reproducible at near-zero margin, one that invites
the most high economy of scale, like any other form of redistributable media.

<p>
Well, whatever.
