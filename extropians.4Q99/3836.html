Max suggested that Extropians consider helping one of many deserving 
institutions--the Grameen Foundation.  Allow me to add a few worthy donees to 
the list:


<OL>
  <li>  Extropy Institute, of course.  You know what it does and how much it needs 
your support.  'Nuff said.

  <li>  HALT (Help Abolish Legal Tyranny) offers salve for the conscience of 
anyone who has profitted from restrictive licensing of legal professionals.  
It fights to give consumers better access to legal advice--and to give 
lawyers less access to monopoly privileges.

  <li>  Educational institutions that you have known and loved, regardless of 
whether or not they already have huge endowments, will at least probably not 
do great harm.  And here, as opposed to so many other potential recipients of 
your largess, you can have a fair amount of confidence about what your money 
will do.


</OL>
<p>
I mention these three donees in the same spirit that others of you have 
mentioned your favorite investments.  Your charitable portfolio should, of 
course, fit your own particular goals.

<p>
December offers a great time to contribute to the tax-deductible cause of 
your choosing.  You probably know something about your year's finances and 
upcoming tax bill, and you can win all the benefits of deductibility despite 
having enjoyed the use of your money for the eleven prior months.
