<a href="1027.html#1035qlink1">&gt; I missed the SciAm article, but in looking at their preprint it is curious</a><br>
<i>&gt; that they don't mention Frank Tipler.  Much of their effort seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be in contradicting Dyson's claim that life could expand forever in</i><br>
<i>&gt; an expanding universe, but Tipler already did that in his Physics of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Immortality.  I can't really judge the merits of the two works, though,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the physics is mostly over my head.</i><br>

<p>
Here's a web address for another concept to mix in with, and compare with the 
SciAm article. Larry Krauss is an entertaining guy with a headfull of clever 
ideas and a terrific teacher. He does, however, fit the SciAM mould, with an 
eye to hide-bound conformity; something which Tipler or Julian Barbour 
(below) definitely do not!

I think to get new notions on the cosmos, you either have to make new 
discoveries with new instruments (upgraded); or to come up with new ideas in 
the theory department. For example, in 1997 SciAm ran a lengthy article; on 
how they were sure nanotechnology was a "cargo-cult science".   To which I 
say Sig Transit Scientific American; Viva! New Scientist.  Shit-disturbers of 
the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your old paradigms.

<br>
<i>&gt;But I think that time is an illusion. Physicists struggling to unify quantum </i><br>
<i>&gt;mechanics and Einstein's general theory of relativity have found hints that </i><br>
the &gt;Universe is timeless. I believe that this idea should be taken 
seriously. &gt;Paradoxically, we might be able to explain the mysterious "arrow 
of time"--the &gt;difference between past and future--by abandoning time. But to 
understand how, we &gt;need to change radically our ideas of how the Universe 
works.
