That's true, though that ability is not so important to the way they think,
I think. (No pun intended.)  I think the overall topology -- their many
nodes versus the vertebrate centralized or, at best, binodal structure --
might make them "mentally" different.  Of course, this is all speculation.
An ethernet is a different network topology than a token ring, yet aside
from some differences in efficiencies and handling nodes and cables going
down, the same sort of communications still go on.  Probably not the best
analogy.

<a name="2964qlink1">I'm not sure how to rate them.  I'm not sure if there is an interspecies IQ
test.  Even so, from the stuff I've read and video I've seen, they appear to
be very intelligent.  They are good at learning from each other, which seems
to be a trait only found in mammals and birds.  (Am I wrong?  Please tell
me!)</a>
