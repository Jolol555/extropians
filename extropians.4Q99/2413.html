I suspect when this person mean't clonning, she mean't it in a "Dolly" sense 
of the word. This would mean a real live-breathing host -mother of course.  
What is more meaningful to us as a species, is the 'clonning' of organs 
in-vitro; so thay can be trans-planted into people. 

<p>
I once heard a British bio-ethicist and scientist say that as long as organs

<a name="2414qlink2">Most people would find this acceptable. How far away is this technology? I 
will err on the side of caution, and say its more likely</a> to be a successful 
<a name="2414qlink3">technology of the 22nd century; rather then the 21st.
