<p>
We had a thread on this once before but cannot recall how it
turned out:  in the old days, when one vowed till death do us
part, that only meant 15-25 years average, because of the shorter
lifespans, all too common tragic death of the mother during
childbirth, etc.

<p>
We hear that this is the age of divorce, but has anyone
corrected for the longer lifespans of moderns?  Is the halflife
of the average marriage actually increasing with time?  Are
there studies on this, anyone?  spike
