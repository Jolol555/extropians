Dan-  I really hate to throw in the towel on a potentially productive 
dialectic, but there seems to be a frustrating pattern of circular 
regression going on here.  Perhaps the argumentation would be more 
interesting and beneficial if you could supply your explanation of qualia, 
instead of just adamantly claiming that they don't exist, explain why every 
single one of us including the rest of the world seems to agree that they 
experience some form of qualia.  Even if we are fooling ourselves and 
experiencing an illusion, there has to be an explanation for why we all seem 
to experience qualia.  If we all share in this illusion, then qualia (or the 
false perception of qualia) seems to be essential the human consciousness, 
if not all current consciousness.  It may even be the essential element that 
sets us apart from AI or is the missing link for strong AI??

<p>
This is all very relevent I would believe to understanding behavior and 
motivation with reward/punish qualitative states.  We don't have to just 
ponder what it is like to feel hungry.  To get more specific and 
microscopic, we can question the purpose of the sensation of an opiate, 
endorphine, or adrenalin and other neural chemistry as motivators. (pardon 
my lack of psycho-chemical terminology)  I'm experiencing the qualia of my 
neuro-chemistry right now (I'm engaged and prioritizing writing this message 
over my qualia of fatigue due to sleep deprivation), and perhaps that is 
what is driving me to write this, and driving me to try to reach some truth. 
  Wouldn't that motivation be nice to harness and impliment in an AI?    We 
all seem to have qualia, so sorry they don't fit into your little box of 
logic.  Just cause they're not convenient to your theory doesn't justify 
erasing them.

<p>
Now from your current perspective, I am trying to understand the benefit of 
denying qualia.  What is gained?  Please tell us your explanation for what 
is going on when you see something that is red.  Or explain what is going on 
when you smash your hand with a hammer.  Feel free to look at something red 
while smashing your hand if it will enhance the non-existence of your 
qualia.  You should limit yourself to three bashes with the hammer so as not 
to obliterate your hand just in case you experience no painful (educational) 
qualia.   Please refrain from your UPPER CASE and lower case definitions 
when reporting your results.

<p>
There was an earlier inquiry as to what qualia is:  qualia is a rather 
slippery term that can easily ooze into conceptual words like sensation, 
"feels like", perceive as, interpret, (the experience of feeling and 
perceiving sensory data) but the simple definition is the qualitative mental 
states like pains, itches, and sensations of red.
True, my red may be your green, but we both seem to be experiencing  a 
sensation (interpretation) of color.
