Maybe I'm wrong but I was under the impression that men were visually
oriented or aroused, while women were tactilly or verbally aroused, and that
the difference does not indicate that men have greater sexual drive than
women. Also, what I've seen of evolutionary behaviorism is that men are
oriented toward polygamy as a more optimum reproductive strategy while women
found monogamy to be more optimum. Just because a man has sex with several
partners while a woman has the same amount of sex but with one partner does
not mean the man is more driven.
