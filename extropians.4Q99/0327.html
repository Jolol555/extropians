 If you want to wait in the country until they make cities as comfortable
 and green as the country, that's your choice, but don't be surprised if
 it is others who have become rich creating those cities.  Making an
 android body as good as protein bodies is *quite* a challenge.

    True, it will be a challenge to make an android body as good as protein 
bodies in all ways, but I don't necessarily need it to be as good in all ways 
since I could always get a new one.  No, what I think we will need is to 
provide uploaded human personalities with sensory input that they are 
familiar with, and allow them to carry on relationships in as close a 
semblance of normalcy as possible.  Remember, while they may be running on a 
new substrate, we are still talking about minds which grew in a certain 
environment, which require certain sensory imagery and relationships for 
their continued mental health.  True, you might be able to redesign the 
uploaded mind so it is preadapted to the new reality (but I would not like 
that as any changes to my personality I want to preapprove if at all 
possible), and there will be some who can make the transition regardless of 
how different from their previous existence, but do you really want to 
survive biological death to to chance psychological damage and suffering when 
simply waiting a fraction of time longer may provide a smoother ride?  You 
may do better waiting until the process has had the bugs worked out before 
being uploaded, as you may actually lose more time having your psyche pieced 
back together from a bad upload.  Of course, if you have a copy of the 
original upload, just not running, you could always keep restarting it in 
different ways until one copy of you makes the transition, but think of the 
carnage to all those other incarnations!  Obviously some of us will opt to be 
adventurous, and I would not want to preclude that option, but for the 
majority of humanity, I think that the gradual approach would be a good one.
