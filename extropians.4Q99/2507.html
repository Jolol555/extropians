Hey, now I realize that "Star Trek" has been accused of growing stale</a> but it 
<a name="3252qlink2">has alot going for it!  "Star Trek" has shown not just this nation but the 
globe a vision of the world where humanity lives in harmony</a> with itself and 
<a name="3252qlink3">many other species with the goal of peaceful exploration.  This show has 
broken racial stereotypes in terms of tv and inspired many young people to 
pursue careers in science.</a>

<p>
<a name="3252qlink4">And frankly while I am not the biggest fan of "Voyager" I did love "Deep 
Space Nine" and really enjoyed the final season even if some called</a> it world 
<a name="3252qlink5">war two in space.  I got to really care about the characters and did not 
find them to be cardboard like with some science-fiction programs.</a>

<p>
<a name="3252qlink6">I do love "Babylon Five" and in some ways found it superior.  The aliens 
were certainly generally more alien!  Though the Narn</a> and the Centauri were 
<a name="3252qlink7">as "human" as Klingons and Romulans.  Also, sadly it is possible</a> that B5 is 
<a name="3252qlink8">a more realistic take on what the future may be life for humanity.  We may 
not have a benevolent "Federation" to govern and protect us.  Humans may 
very well not be dominant "big shot" race as as they appear to be in "Star 
</a>Trek."

<p>
I think I experienced at times more of a sense of wonder from B5 in the ways 
I have also felt it when reading science-fiction.  But I love both series 
and ST certainly has had some great episodes too.

<p>
<a name="3252qlink9">To end my post I will make this statement...
"One thing in favor of "Star Trek, at least it wasn't "Battlestar 
Galactica!" :)
</a>


<p>
sincerely,

<p>
