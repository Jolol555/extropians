Does it make sense to differentiate what we "want to want" (W2) from
what we "want to want to want" (W3)?</a>

<p>
I can see differentiating simple wants (W1) from W2s.  I W1 to overeat,
to lie around and read, to indulge various other bad habits.  At the
same time I W2 to avoid these things and spend my time on things that
will be more rewarding in the long term.  But the role of "W3" is unclear.</a>

<p>
If we think of ourselves as made of parts, like a Minsky Society of Mind,
then some parts W1 long-term things, and other parts W1 short-term things.
The long-term parts W1 the short-term parts not to W1 what they do,
hence they W2 long-term things as well as W1 them.

<p>
However I can't see, in this model, where W3 would come into play.
Those parts which I identify with when I say that I W2 long-term things
seemingly would be happy once this is achieved.  If we got rid of (or
changed) the parts of me that W1 short-term things, I would no longer
W1 those things and hence I would W2 long-term things.  That's as far
as I go.  I can't see how parts of me could W3 something.

<p>
<a name="2877qlink2">In fact I'm not sure this distinction between "W2" and "W1" really works.
Those parts of me with which I identify when I say I W2 long-term things
are the same ones which W1 those things.  Saying they W2 them is just
a matter of saying that they W1 them but don't always get what they W1
because other parts of me get in the way.  So really the "W2" is just
a matter of a strong "W1" which is being thwarted.</a>

<p>
I could just as easily identify with the short-term parts of me and say
that I W2 short-term things.  Sometimes people express this by saying
that they want to learn how to stop worrying and just enjoy the moment.

<p>
Ultimately choosing what to W2 is a matter of selecting specific W1s to
emphasize.  The winning W1s get elevated to W2s.  I can't see how to
carry this process on to produce W3s.
