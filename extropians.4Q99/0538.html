A smaller version of "Nanogirl news" mainly to feature this first topic that
appears in Fox News.

*Immortality on Ice. Cryonics May Offer Life After Death for Those Willing<br>
to Wait. (Ralph Merkle, Alcor, Marvin Minsky, Robert Ettinger, Leary,
nanotechnology mentions)
<br>
(animation and pictures included) "Death sucks."

*Artificial and real nerve cells linked. Using $7.50 worth of electrical<br>
parts, scientists hooked up an artificial neuron with biological nerve cells
extracted from a lobster. The resulting neuron network transmitted signals
back and forth just like the real thing — one small step toward a bionic
future.

*The Ultimate Fine Print. A new technique to print using an ink jet may one<br>
day make it possible to "type" letters that are too small for the naked eye
to read. Physicists have formulated a way, in theory, to make nanodrops of
ink that are 100 times smaller than those produced by the best ink-jet
printers on the market. If it works in practice, the method could be used to
print invisible serial numbers on computer chips or on currency.

Examiner &amp; Chronicle)

$10 million school grant to collaborate with UC-Berkeley, Intel, Genentech.
Armed with a $10 million grant, San Francisco schools will train hundreds of
teachers, allow students to collaborate with scientists at UC-Berkeley and
intern with engineers at Intel or Genentech.

*White House to Host Eighth Millennium Evening Oct. 12 in Live Cybercast.<br>
President and First Lady will host the eighth Millennium Evening at the
White House. The program,  titled, "Informatics Meets Genomics," will
feature Dr. Vinton Cerf, Senior Vice President of Internet Architecture and
Technology at MCI  WorldCom, and Dr. Eric Lander, Director of the Whitehead
Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research.

*Going Mad with Smads. In the past year, several studies of mice with<br>
genetically manipulated Smad genes have caught the attention of cancer
researchers. Smad is a family of at least nine genes, each bearing an
identifying number (e.g., Smad1, Smad2, and Smad9), and each encoding a
protein involved in mediating cellular responses to transforming growth
factor (beta) (TGF-(beta)) and related polypeptides.

*High-tech rodent goes everywhere.IntelliMouse Explorer uses tiny digital<br>
camera and a light to point, click. It has no moving parts. Instead of the
traditional rubber ball and rollers, the IntelliMouse Explorer uses patented
IntelliEye technology, a red light and a miniature digital camera. The
camera takes 1,500 snapshots per second, of the surface beneath the moving
mouse. A built-in digital signal processor (DSP) translates these movements
on your computer screen. This "image correlation processing" is 12 times
faster than an ordinary mouse and is running at 18 million instructions per
second (MIPS).

*Here comes the sun battery. A discovery by Japanese chemists might help to<br>
turn sunlight and water into fuel for transportation and power generation --
with the added bonus that the fuel is non-polluting when burned, producing
nothing but pure water.

*A Super-Sensitive Detector. To follow the trail of a terrorist,<br>
investigators need to identify extremely small residues of explosives or
biological warfare agents. The 11 October PRL describes a new method for
detecting molecules in tiny concentrations that is 100 times more sensitive
than current methods and could help those investigators.

*World: Americas Russian hackers attacked Pentagon. Hackers apparently<br>
working from Russia have broken into US Government computer systems for over
a year, an FBI official has said.
