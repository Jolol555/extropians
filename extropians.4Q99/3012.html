<a name="3111qlink1">For extropes hoping to avoid the hangover of the (not)millennium parties,
New Scientist recommends:

<p>
So, onto N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC),</a> an
<pre>
            amino acid supplement sold in health
            food stores. This proved to be a winner.
<br>
            "Fantastic," said one volunteer. "My head<br>
            didn't feel fuzzy at all," said another. 

            NAC is thought to work by boosting the
            body's ability to mop up destructive
            chemicals called free radicals which build
            up in the liver as enzymes break down
            ethanol. Free radicals are usually seen off
            by glutathione, but after heavy drinking
            reserves of this enzyme can run low. NAC
            helps because it is rich in cysteine, a
            sulphur-rich amino acid that forms the
            core of glutathione. Fuelled by supplies of
            cysteine, glutathione remains plentiful
            and detoxification goes on for longer.
<br>
            "NAC is like a 'pro-drug' that's converted<br>
            into glutathione," says Carl Waltenbaugh,
            an alcohol researcher from Northwestern
            University Medical School in Chicago. 

            NAC also gives a clue to the success of
            some age-old hangover cures, such as
            prairie oysters, omelettes and the English
            fried breakfast. They all contain
            eggs-which are also rich in cysteine.

BTW, they reckon drinking lots of water before snoozing doesn't work.
