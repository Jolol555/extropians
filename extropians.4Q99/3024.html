I second this.  I own several large tracts of "worthless" land, including
some off of the above mentioned Highway 50 in Nevada.  There are marked
state highways (albeit single lane dirt road "highways") in Nevada
whereyou can drive 50-100 miles without seeing a single building.

<p>
And much of the "worthless" land is extraordinarily well endowed with
natural resources.  For example, I own one large (640 acre) tract of
partially forested, rich volcanic land in Nevada that contains springs
producing around 100 acre-ft of water a year (1 acre-ft = ~8 person-yrs of
water in a modern society).  Farms in the area produce high quality
potatos, beef, and other agricultural products in large quantities.  This
land is neither unique nor expensive.  And to top it off, the nearest
piece of civilization is a ranch 15 miles away; the nearest town
<a name="3028qlink1">(population 50) is 25 miles away.  Talk about under-utilization...

<p>
I have been to many, many other places in North America that fit this
description.<a name="3032qlink1">  I always grouped the "over-population" crowd with the
"endangered species" crowd; they erroneously extrapolate a local
phenomenon to cover the entire planet.  (For those unfamiliar with the
topic, there are many "endangered species" that were listed as endangered
because they no longer lived in an environmentalist's backyard. 
Nonetheless, many of those "endangered species"</a> are fluorishing by the
millions in other, less visited, regions of the planet.  See Alaska or
Canada for several examples of over-populated "endangered species" in North
America.)

<p>
Canada has roughly half the population of the U.S.  Somewhere in the range

of 125-135 million.

 
<p>
<a href="3017.html#3024qlink3">&gt; I think that "over population" is another successful meme which has little </a><br>

<p>
Agreed.  Over-population is largely a local phenomenon.
