In reponse to the post below. Huh? The name "Nanogirl"= nano+girl, =
nanotechnology, and, I am female, it's a my nickname. If you don't know
nanotechnology, is technology based on the manipulation of individual atoms
and molecules to build structures to complex, atomic specifications. (See
Engines of Creation or Nanosystems by K. Eric Drexler)
The Nanogirl news is a collection of high technology news items culled from
numerous on and off line news sources, that I post for peoples information
via email. (to extropians as well as other email threads, including my own
at nanotech@onelist.com
<br>
To start with your question about Nanotechnology Industries. Nanotechnology
Industries is a non-profit scientific organization that is still in the
organizational stage. Our mission is to develop an awareness of
nanotechnology among technical and business people, to build a network of
technical and business people interested in nanotechnology, to explore
possible development pathways, and to identify the major problems and find
ways to solve them. We anticipate that as potential solutions to the
problems of developing first molecular machine systems, and then, advanced
molecular manufacturing systems are
<br>
found, we will form partnerships with those with the necessary laboratory
skills and financial resources. It is hoped that one or more for-profit
entities will then be set up to pursue those goals.
For the moment, our major activities include our web site, email nanogirl
news, our newsletter, getting legally organized, building a community of
researchers and business people interested in nanotechnology, and finding
sponsors to fund a major study of progress, problems, and opportunities in
nanotechnology. There is a strong interest in
eventual investor programs and lab collaboration, or on the flip side may
even consider working with others and submitting paper proposal to insite a
grant
<br>
and continue as non-profit. Both of these would need people of hands on/in
the lab research to give attributes that would qualify for either.
I'm not sure how to take your "Borg Barbie or a pseudonym for someone
stranger
<br>
than strange." comment. But I will give you the benefit of the doubt.
I hope that this has saved you the incredible exertion of click on my "hot
link" or actually reading the nanogirl news.  Gina "NANOGIRL" Miller
