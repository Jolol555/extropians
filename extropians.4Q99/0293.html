<a href="0283.html#0293qlink1">&gt;    Meta-style....yeah, I like that, I like that a lot.  You might use your </a><br>

<i>&gt;styles in the social situation. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0417qlink1">This may be a reflection of a variant personal perspective here, but</a> aren't
we doing this already?  Think about an average week in your own life.  Do
you place yourself into a variety of social and professional situations, in
each of which you display a particular style variant of your core self?

<p>
As I write this, I prepare to go to the office.  For that, casual
professional wear, a cool and calm demeanor--the savvy, capable careerist.
Then, I'll slip out for martinis with friends later.  For that, jeans and a
black shirt, a relaxed demeanor--we will exchange witty stories and laugh
often, maybe flirt with someone cute.  Then, another night, off to a
philosophical salon, at which I want to wear something neutral and
nondistracting.  I listen carefully and speak only after formulating a
rational and incisive reply to the discussion.  Then--the weekend and Urban
Explorer Mode for wandering the streets or maybe Weekend Outdoorsman for a
quick hike through the Shanendoah.  And, of course, the internet, where
words and only words form the aesthetic through which someone would access
my personality.

<p>
If a given person only saw me in one of those situations, they might form
an opinion as to my personality or temperament.  And, in times past, that
might be a valid assessment, but human social interactions have developed
into a complex maze of sucessive encounters based on a particular style
interface.<a name="0316qlink1">  All of that combines into what Anders calls 'meta-style'.</a>

<p>
What is your meta-style?
