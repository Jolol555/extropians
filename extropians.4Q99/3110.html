<a name="3147qlink2">The problem is, if we think "national" morality is a scandal, this is nothing
compared to "international" morality.  It is curious how a species as
apparently intelligent as ourselves has been so impotent in translating
ordinary village civility into intercivility with respect to the relations of
putatively civilized political entities.</a>

"gratuitous homicide", based entirely on indulgence in sadomasochistic
anal wishes, is permitted with discretion by military officers because
of its power to intimidate (or "terrorize").</a>

Unfortunately, a medical, like a German, joke is no laughing matter.
So what is a Saturnian to do?
