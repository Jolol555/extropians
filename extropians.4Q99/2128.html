<i>&gt; to do anything of the sort for life support.  Providing air, water</i><br>
<i>&gt; and climate control requires only mechanical systems and a decent</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy source.  Providing food is simply a matter of growing crops,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is something we do know a lot about.</i><br>

<a name="2133qlink1">Ask the cosmonauts how they and everything they were living among
smelled after the end of a long stay in Mir. (If you can't find a
cosmonaut, ask a sailor who has done a long tour of duty on a
nuclear submarine.)  Foul air is an unsolved problem for long-term
<a name="2201qlink1">missions.  Biosphere 2 experienced no foul air problems (although
there was that bit about uncured concrete stealing the oxygen)
</a>
although earlier biosphere closures had, because they pumped their
air through a soil bed with a variety of carefully chosen bacterial
cultures growing in it.

<p>
<a name="2133qlink2">As we extend human presence in space to larger populations and
longer stays, more problems of this kind are going to come up.
Your assertion about "mechanical systems and a decent energy source"
has *never* been tested in a closed biosphere with a large human
population over a long period of time, and I see no reason to accept
it in advance of such testing.  Don't confuse wishful thinking
with practical optimism.

<a href="2122.html#2128qlink2">&gt; Mind you, I do think we would be wise to do everything we can to</a><br>
<i>&gt; maximize the colony's resources in this regard.  We should take</i><br>
<i>&gt; along a good assortment of experts in related fields, as well as</i><br>
<i>&gt; a good variety of plant and insect species (no 'one person growing</i><br>
<i>&gt; one crop' scenarios, please - we don't want the colony to fail</i><br>
<i>&gt; because we happened to pick the one plant that doesn't adapt well</i><br>
<i>&gt; to low gravity).  However, I see no reason to think that moving</i><br>
<i>&gt; food production into space will be anywhere near as difficult as</i><br>
<i>&gt; creating an entire biosphere.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2133qlink3">The setup you propose with its "mechanical systems" *is* a biosphere
which will have to be created, so of course moving self-sustaining
food production into space will be exactly as difficult as creating
an entire biosphere. The question is, will the biosphere you create
</a>
succeed or fail, over the long term, in supporting the lives of a
human society or not.
