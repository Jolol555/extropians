    ~ Beauty, Charm, and Strangeness: Science as Metaphor ~

<pre>
                                by John Banville

<p>
I wish to advance a thesis which, were they to take note of it, the
academies would decry as scandalous. My thesis is that modern
science, particularly physics, is being forced, under pressure of its
own advances, to acknowledge that the truths it offers are true not
in an absolute but in a poetic sense, that its laws are contingent,
that its facts are a kind of metaphor. Of course, art and science
are fundamentally different in their methods, and in their ends.
The doing of science involves a level of rigor unattainable to art.
A scientific hypothesis can be proven--or, perhaps more importantly,
disproven--but a poem, a picture, or a piece of music, cannot. Yet
in their origins art and science are remarkably similar. It was a scientist,
<a name="2590qlink1">Niels Bohr, who declared that a great truth is a statement whose
opposite is also a great truth.</a> Oscar Wilde would have agreed.
