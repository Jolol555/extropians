<a href="2044.html#2059qlink1">&gt; We've had astronauts in orbit</a><br>
<i>&gt; for a few months with minimal resupply, and they have few health</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems other than some musculo-skeletal degeneration,</i><br>

<p>
NASA is beginning to work on gene expression studies.  I'm fairly
confident that within a few years we will be able to pick out the
"gravity activated" regulatory factors and be working on ways to
manipulate them via drugs or GenEng.

<a name="2060qlink1"><a href="2044.html#2059qlink2">&gt; Rebuilding a viable population wouldn't take more than a few tons</a><br>
<i>&gt; of humans--a dozen young, healthy, diverse fertile women and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; dewar full of sperm--but any small lack of foresight or setback</i><br>
<i>&gt; that prevented them from bearing healthy fertile children would</i><br>
<i>&gt; doom the colony, and we'd need about 16 years before we'd know.</i><br>

<p>
Lee my good fellow, why on Earth would you want to continue
propagating the alphabet soup that constitutes our genome?
Are you a closet luddite sent to spy on us?

<p>
Seriously, if we can take the human genome apart in less than
a generation, I don't see why we can't engineer a better one
in the same time (given the march of the underlying technologies).
[The point to this is highly questionable however, given the possibility
of nanotech and uploads, but we'll assume we want some fallback
position in case a luddite virus wipes out the uploads.]
