<a name="1058qlink2">I believe you're approach would work.  However I think that most

Perhaps a little radioactive iodine</a> (presumably courtesy of
our nuclear testing over they years).  By far and away the
largest dose a subset of the population receives is from
Radon being slowly leaked into their homes in areas where
the rocks (presumably igneous) that have a high content
of radioactive elements from the Earth's core.

<p>
So while it is an interesting idea, I think we would have to sit down
with our caculators and figure out how much this really buys us.

I'll see if I can nudge Robert F. into putting some of this material
into Chapter 13 of NM.
