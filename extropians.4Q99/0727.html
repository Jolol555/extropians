<p>
As I have repeatedly stated by private email, I don't view
Max and Natasha as enemies.  I don't view ExI in a negative
light.  In fact, I don't even know where some of the more personal comments came from, and would appreciate it, again, if Natasha would take me up on my offer to discuss it apart from email. 

<p>
I am disturbed that such personal information would become part
of an e-list discussion--I have certainly never taken anything
that private into the public realm and would never do so.  I have
spent my entire morning trying to get one of them to talk to me, and
I find it sad that once again we have splits based on personal
animosity.  

<p>
<a name="0736qlink1">I suppose I will have to think about my future participation on
this list.  I have made many new friends over the past month or
so, and many of you have subscribed to THE TRANSHUMANIST and have
discussed various topics with me.  Please write to me by private
email and render your opinion on this, because I'm at a complete
loss here.</a>
