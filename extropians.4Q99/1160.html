	The reason that religion often gets "bashed" on this list is because most
list members have high regard for reason, rationality and absolute values.
It is rare for a religion to possess any of these facets at the core of its
value system.  Beliefs in gods and unprovable acts and histories seems as
absurd when there is a plethora of evidence to prove otherwise.  As to the
idea of learning all about a particular religion before condemning it, I
will say that *all* religions (to my knowledge) have the lowest common
denominator of belief in the unprovable...there are far more tangible
things to spend time learning about.

<p>
	By the way, I would not say that no-one has been completely extropic: it
took someone whose existance is provable to formalize the philosophy, and
many others to agree with it.
