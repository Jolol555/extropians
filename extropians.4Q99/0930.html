<a name="0938qlink3"><i>&gt;There is a big deal of difference between respect and</i><br>

<a name="0938qlink4">The last thing I particularly recall about these jerks</a> was when Thomas Ssazz 
<a name="0974qlink1"><a name="0941qlink1">(sp?) ("The Manufacture of Madness," various other works) did his famous 
study in which he sent grad student volunteers in to pose as patients in 
various psychiatric hospitals.</a>  They were not to pretend to any symptoms, 
just act normal, etc.  The "doctors" never caught on - but the real patients 
recognized that they didn't belong immediately.  The "doctors" would 
interview one of the grad students, who would talk perfectly normally to the 
"doctor," while the "doctor" is taking notes and saying, "uh huh, that's 
very interesting.  Please tell me more.  How does that make you feel , etc." 
- out-Eliza-ing Eliza!  When the grad students would try to ask the "doctor" 
a question, however, they could never get a reply, just more of the same, 
"why do you ask that?"  Who was crazy here?
I used to see this lady in Long Beach, who hung out on the street and lived 
in some cheap one room flophouse, after CA released a horde of mental 
patients back into the community in the '70's.  She was obviously out of it, 
talking to people who weren't there - at least I didn't see them, reacting 
totally inappropriately to any contact from real humans, etc.  So one day, 
</a>
after a year or two of seeing here every time I went to the post office, 
having a big bottle of 1000mg Nicotinic Acid with me from my job at the 
health food warehouse, I offered her a handful of the caplets, warning her 
of the flushing, etc.  The next time I saw her, she was positively beaming, 
and we had a perfectly normal conversation for the first time, and I 
couldn't detect any sign of a problem.
<br>
A few days later, I saw her again.  She was totally gone, but I managed to 
find out that one of the bums who shared the flophouse had stolen her 
niacin, assuming it was drugs, no doubt.  Then the state psychiatrist who 
handled her case warned never again to use any unauthorized medicine, so I 
could never convince her to try again.
