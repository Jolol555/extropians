<i>&gt;"Lee Daniel Crocker" says:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt;&gt; I know the laws of probability are real not because I BELIEVE</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt;&gt; in it but because I CAN PROVE IT.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; &lt;devil's advocacy&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Ahem.  I assert that you cannot prove it.  Robert attacked </i><br>
<i>&gt;probability on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; its strongest side...  What would you say to this experiment?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; I assert that it is completely impossible for you to flip a coin 1 </i><br>
<i>&gt;million</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; times and have it turn up heads every time.  When I say completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; impossible, I mean that it will never EVER happen, no matter how many</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; times you try.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; &gt; &lt;/devil's advocacy&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; You're being very sloppy with your language and your thinking here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; PROOF, as in absolute inviolable certainty, is irrelevant to reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I can't PROVE the laws of probability, but that doesn't mean I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; to have faith in them to make use of them.  There _is_ a useful middle</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; ground--committment.  I have committed thousands of dollars over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; years to my mastery of the laws of probability, and given the</i><br>
<i>&gt;...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, which is it?  You seem confused.  First you shout out that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;CAN PROVE IT.  (Pretty sure of yourself.)  Then you say, a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;quieter, "I can't PROVE the laws of probability..."  I think that</i><br>
<i>&gt;hissing sound is your argument deflating.  You say you've mastered the</i><br>
<i>&gt;laws of probability.  That's nice.  How do we know they're real laws,</i><br>
<i>&gt;not just some idea which has worked out for you?</i><br>
</a>

<p>
I said "I CAN PROVE IT"
<br>
Someone else, I think Phil, wrote the weak worded reply
Lee Daniel Crocker, replied telling Phil? his mistake.

<p>
I did make a reply to Phil, but in another message.  I don't back out on 
what I said.  Someone pointed out to me in this other message that I may 
have just found some probability model that works for me.

<p>
Are we straight on this?  Check the archives.
