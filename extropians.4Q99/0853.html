Im betting on the kill vehicles.</a>  As time goes on, they actually get smaller
and cheaper to build, because you get the economies of scale.  Consider
the THAAD missile: It isnt very big, 340 mm diameter, length on the order
of 4 meters.  Top speed 7000 horseturds per fortnight.  Altho they must
be manufactured with excruciating care and quality control [as my muchchastised
 employer found out] they arent *that* difficult to make.  It has
a manufactured sapphire targeting window, which is said to cost $60K, but the
*real* hi tech part of THAAD is in... the software!  And one that is
written, its free to replicate.

Hope so.  I think you are a few years younger than me, so you may
not know what Im talking about when I mention duck-and-cover drills.
But be sure it did untold psychological damage to our young people.

I like to think that the technologically advanced nations can help developing
nations by providing leap-frog technologies.  For instance, poor nations
need not pay for all the expensive infrastucture of telephone lines everywhere
since they can leap directly to cell phones.

<p>
In like manner, the US can spare developing nations the crushing expense
of each dictator needing her own nuclear subs, bombers, missiles, etc.
She can leap-frog to THAAD missiles and save billions of defense dollars,
then use her nation's resources to actually build something useful, like
we have here in the sillyclone valley: vast sprawling neighborhoods of
half million dollar tract shacks.

<p>
Oh by the way, LMCo the maker of the successful THAAD missile
is having a half price sale on its stock.  Today the stock price was half
what it was a year ago...  {8-[
