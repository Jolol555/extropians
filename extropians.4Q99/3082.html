<a name="3103qlink1">I don't want to try to tell you how to tell on a case by case basis</a> who
is fooling themselves about what.  I just claimed that on average people
in love do systematically fool themselves about several things.  Surely you
are familiar with the standard literary scenarios of the foolishness of
those in love, and those who were fooled by others who acted like they were
more in love than their later actions suggest.

<p>
I don't really care about you in particular.  But there is a vast literature
saying that lots more than half the population think they are better drivers,
lovers, stock traders, etc. than average.  Men tend to do this more than women.
