Koestler's argument is quite detailed and is part of a larger picture of an 
analysis of humor, creativity and - oops forgotten the third one momentarily 
(it's been about 30 years since I read the book).  I recall that I disagreed 
or was not convinced about some of his other arguments, but most of the 
humor analysis made perfect sense.  Here is a small portion of his argument 
and position as I recall it:

<p>
All humor can be shown to resolve to perceiving or grasping something in two 
contradictory lights simultaneously, the pun being the simplest example.  
The brain, simplifying greatly, involves not just the "digital" kind of 
behavior involving discrete signals and switching  by neurons, axon, 
dendrites, etc., but also the hormonal/emotional system that sets up both 
brain and body for particular value orientations - good/bad, fight/flight, 
etc.
<br>
The reason humor works is that the two systems function at very different 
speeds and via very different mechanisms.  The "digital" processing can 
switch between the two mutually exclusive contexts of a humorous situatiion 
very rapidly, giving the impression subjectively of holding them both 
simultaneously.  The hormonal/emotional charge associated with each 
position, however, cannot switch nearly as rapidly.  In fact, even though 
the value charge associate with each perspective may be only slightly 
different, and very slight to begin with, each digital switch forces the 
emotional system to try to follow.  But there isn't time enough to reabsorb 
the hormones, so the emotional system has to override them instead, with a 
higher concentration with each cycle.
<br>
Thus, even though the pun or joke may have little intrinsic charge 
associated with either position, the natural following function of the 
emotional system escalates the concentrations of hormones rapidly in 
successive overrides, building to a critical threshhold similar to an 
orgasm, in which any other data is being lost, at which point we laugh, as a 
physical response designed to relieve that pent-up charge.

<p>
As an aside, I saw a marvelous little outtake in the recent 9/6/99 Time in 
their article on animal intelligence.  Seems that this researcher had at 
least two parrots, one of whose name was Paco.  The other parrot was 
observing her prepare dinner, and, at the point she brought out a cornish 
game hen, announced loudly, "Oh no, Paco!"
So she went and got Paco, just to reassure the bird that he was alive, at 
which point the parrot said, "Oh no!" and then burst into peals of laughter. 
  I find nothing unbelievable about the idea that a parrot can have a finely 
tuned sense of humor.  I've seen coyotes in captivity react in ways that 
appeared to be deliberately ironic or sarcastic.  On the other hand, it is 
harder to seen how an upload that was not modeled after real consciousness 
in some way in its actual circuitry would be able to experience or enjoy 
humor.
