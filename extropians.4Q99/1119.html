An interesting story about Waco and the question of whether gunfire
was directed at the compound is available from the Dallas Morning News
web site:

   A lawyer for the Branch Davidians challenged the federal government
   Wednesday to join in scientific infrared field tests that he says
   will prove his experts' contention that agents fired guns at the
   group's compound on the last day of a 1993 standoff near Waco.

<p>
   "The results of this demonstration will prove conclusively that the only
   possible explanation for the flashes seen on FBI FLIR [infrared video]
   tapes from April 19, 1993, is gunfire," Michael Caddell of Houston
   wrote in a four-page letter to the Department of Justice. "The refusal
   of the FBI to participate will certainly be interpreted as an admission
   of liability."

   A Maryland scientist retained by the Justice Department to help defend
   the government in the pending Branch Davidian case said his company
   has found no recorded evidence of gunfire.

<p>
   "According to our analysis, it isn't gunfire," said Norris Krone, an
   aeronautical engineer whose Maryland Advanced Development Laboratory
   has used computer programs developed for a sniper-detection project
   to study the FBI infrared tapes. "It doesn't have a signature that
   resembles gunfire"

<p>
   He declined to detail his lab's analysis, noting only that it
   determined that the FBI camera was too far away to record muzzle
   flashes from weapons on the ground and that white blips on the infrared
   videotape last too long to be from gunfire. He declined to say what
   might have caused the flashes.
<br>
<i>[...]</i><br>
<p>
   Mr. Caddell has said that he believes that government agents involved
   in the April 19 assault began firing guns at the Davidians to defend
   the government's tanks.

<p>
   He noted in his Wednesday letter that his assessment has been supported
   by scientific experts hired by outside media and the House Government
   Reform Committee, which recently began a new investigation of the
   Davidian incident.

<p>
   An expert for the House committee said last month that his preliminary
   evaluation of the infrared tape indicated that it did capture the
   thermal images of government gunfire. He was allowed on Friday to study
   the FBI's original copy of the tape for the first time and is still
   working on his final analysis, said committee spokesman Mark Carollo.
<br>
<i>[...]</i><br>
<p>
   The test would be staged at a Dallas-area gun club using an airborne
   camera similar to the one used by the FBI in Waco. It would record
   gunshots on the ground from firearms similar to those deployed by
   both government agents and the Davidians.

<p>
   Mr. Carollo said the committee "would welcome" such a test, adding
   that a "side-by-side analysis," of the FBI's recording and a test
   recording might help resolve the gunfire issue.


<p>
See <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/specials/waco/">http://www.dallasnews.com/specials/waco/</a> for more articles on Waco,
including a claim that the FBI had the site ringed with video cameras and
has a lot of footage of the final assault which it has never released,
claiming national security (apparently they used secret military robot
technology to place some of the video cameras).
