<a href="1697.html#1703qlink1">&gt; Boyle's  Laws and like that.  When gas is heated in a closed container </a><br>
<i>&gt; the pressure increases.  Now why....fundamentally.....at the molecular </i><br>
<i>&gt; level....is that?  Well the way I understand it is that the velocity of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the individual gas molecules increases....which thru a chain of events</i><br>
<i>&gt; exerts more pressure on the containment walls.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I may be missing something here....but where is the "for every action</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is an equal and opposite reaction".   </i><br>

<p>
Don't forget that velocity, and therefore momentum, is a vector.  As
the heat input is converted to kinetic energy of the gas molecules, the
overall effect looks like "pressure" because the vectors all point in
random directions, so the overall velocity (and momentum) of the
container as a whole is still zero.  Momentum is preserved.

<p>
<a href="1697.html#1703qlink2">&gt; Even if i'm not missing something......&lt;great leap&gt;....suppose that</a><br>
<i>&gt; all of the gas molecules could be coaxed to go in the same direction?</i><br>
<i>&gt; So if a gadget (with all kinds of neat magnetic fields and primary and </i><br>
<i>&gt; seconday windings and multicolored flashing lights) could be developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; that would convince all the gas in a container that they should go in</i><br>
<i>&gt; ONE direction when heated......wouldn't that be a reactionless drive?</i><br>

<p>
The only way to "convince" an atom to move in a certain direction is
by giving it momentum stolen from something else.  Magnetic fields
aren't enough: a magnet might attract an ion, causing it to move toward
the magnet, but it also move the magnet a tiny bit toward the ion in
proportion to its relative mass.  For one ion, you won't notice this,
but if you try to move a significant mass, you're trying to pull a
car with a magnet mounted on the car.

<p>
You can't get away from needing reaction mass if you really want to
go from point A to point B.  Something like Lorrey Drive will let you
wiggle around point A for a while, but that's of limited use.

<p>
<a href="1697.html#1703qlink3">&gt; So the point I'm speculating about....perhaps there will be some other </a><br>
<i>&gt; effects of drextech ......really soon now.</i><br>

<p>
I don't think tunneling violates conservation of momentum, but I may
be mistaken about that.  If it does, that very well might be used to
get around some of the reaction mass problem--but a more likely way it
will be done is with the big scoop to suck up stray hydrogen atoms
along the way to push out the tailpipe.
