<i>&gt; teachers will have some students at both ends of the spectrum, with</i><br>

<i>&gt; bad idea. White upper class suburban schools will do better on</i><br>
<i>&gt; average (as they do now) and teachers will refuse to work in</i><br>
<i>&gt; schools they know to be bad....</i><br>

<p>
If you limit the bell curve on which the teachers are evaluated to
within the same school district, then I think you can eliminate
socioeconomic bias. Of course it could be argued that the poor school
districts already get the worst teachers, I mean, why would you teach in
the inner cities unless you couldn't get a job anywhere safe in the
suburbs or in the country?

<p>
I think it can be argued that this is already a contributor to poor
performance of poor school districts. Did you know that of all
professions requiring a four year bachelors degree, teachers had the
lowest average SAT scores coming out of high school?
