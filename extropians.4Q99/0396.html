The fact that the government has been paying for education, has stopped the free
enterprise systems from finding cheaper and better way of educating people.
People are educated basically the same way they were a 100 years ago.  I.E. the
teacher imparts most of the information to the students verbally.

<p>
But the world has changed.  Books used to be more expensive, and buildings and
teacher time where much less valuable.  Now books and computers are cheap, and
buildings and teacher time are very expensive.

<p>
It is time for radical changes in education, and many of those changes will make
education cheaper.
