Someone comes to me and tells me a story of a woman floating in the air,
brilliant lights shining all around her.  I am very skeptical about this
and tend to believe it is not a true story.  Then I learn that the woman
was on a stage, and standing beside her was a magician waving his wand.
Now the story becomes much more plausible, because now I can see that
there are technological means which would accomplish what earlier sounded
like something which would defy the laws of physics.

<p>
In the Matrix, if someone tells me that they say a person leap 50 feet
through the air, I would be inclined not to believe him, if I thought
the world was "real".  But if the Matrix Hypothesis were proven, I would
change my view and I would say that this is a very real possibility.
Such things are possible in the Matrix, but not in the real world.

<p>
In each case, I gain knowledge which turns the event from an effective
impossibility into something which is technologically possible.  This
forces me to re-evaluate the probability of whether it occured.

<p>
A priori, if I hear that Jesus healed cripples with a touch or walked
on water, I find this to be virtually impossible to believe.  However,
if I come to believe that aliens were present on the earth at the time
who had the technology to accomplish this, it forces me to give a much
higher degree of credibility to the story.  It is no longer impossible,
it no longer defies the laws of nature.

<p>
I don't understand this notion of "ideal epistemic conditions", but it
seems to me that accepting the presence of super-advanced technology
forces us to give credibility to otherwise impossible tales.
