     Extropianism will probably be seen as one of the major influences in 
shaping transhumanity, but it is much more questionable whether it will 
retain its current form.  The present extropian movement embraces a set of 
principles very different from those of the mainstream.  Our principles 
encompass a view of the future(s) that most people are not geared to 
understanding.  If we are successful, this will gradually change(it may 
already be happening in a small way).  But, in becoming more widely 
accepted, it is likely to lose much of its "differentness".  Of course, in 
large part this will occur because extropian ideas will become more 
accepted.  But the more controversial ideas of some extropians (human 
obsolescence, hard-line anarcho-capitalism, positive atheism, etc.) will 
become less important to the movement as a whole.  They will not disappear 
entirely- there are, after all, still Stalinist/Maoist groups even after 
Russia &amp; China have pretty much given up on communism- but as larger numbers 
of people embrace core extropian ideas, they will bring their own views to 
bear, and Extropian evolution, for better or worse will reflect this.  And 
so we will have leftist-extros, populist-extros, survivalist-extros(no doubt 
promoting the value of survival retreats on the Moon as protection against 
nanowar...), Christian-extros, Muslim-extros(offering their women chadors 
that double as wearables?)
<br>
and, eventually, maybe even neo-neo Luddite extros(who want to focus on 
optimizing &amp; upgrading bio-bodies, and rail against the "alienation from 
nature &amp; our primal selves" that uploading entails....
<p>
     And, in the elections of 2048 we'll find a big-eared agitator decrying 
the "giant sucking sound" of all our investment capital taking off for the 
asteroid belt.  He'll contend in a primary against  an opponent who will 
threaten to marshall an army of "programmers with pitchforks"(!) to combat 
the "soulless menace" of self-programming AIs.  We will also be treated to 
<br>
"mainstream" demagogues who will promise immortality subsidies, two <br>
nanofactories in every home and a starship in every garage.  And, when all 
is said and done, we'll  be treated to the spectacle of "World President 
Elect" Hillary Rodham, Jr.'s inagural address, in which she will begin her 
lifetime tenure as an overblown welfare client by heaping praise on "all the 
great extropian thinkers who made me what I am today" and note verbosely 
that "Now, more than ever, it takes a village to construct a child"...
