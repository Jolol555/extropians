I did not expect the heart to keep beating.  It is the restart that
is the trick, and worth studying if not for hibernation, then just
to extend the rescue time for drowning victims.

<p>
Yes, I expect it would be at first.  However, when relatively automated it
would not take much to support large groups.

<p>
I envisioned people floating in chambers wearing something that
looks like a wet suit, but works like a cross between a G-suit
and a portable iron lung.  Rhythmic pressure around the legs and
arms alternates with pressure around the chest to circulate the
blood (this presumes the individual still has operational heart
valves), with periodic lung inflation.  At very low metabolism,
the need for blood flow is greatly reduced, and flotation
makes the job much easier.

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
That is certainly worth looking into.  You would have to check to see
that the kinds of things you are trying to avoid are all metabolism
effects and not just temperature effects, or there would be no
point.


<p>

<a href="0314.html#0343qlink4">&gt; The decrease in metabolic activities cited above should retard</a><br>

<i>&gt; your body could be breakfast, lunch and dinner for the "parasites".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Yes, I thought about this as well.  Some protozoa do quite well at low
temperatures and if not prevented, you would be duck soup to them.

<p>
Once there is MNT, there is no need for this or cryonics or just about
anything I would design in the mean time.

<p>
Thank you for your comments.
