This is a highly informative piece, attempting to explain a variety
of theories.  *Well* worth the read.

<p>
I would have to fall into the camp that savants are able to access
underlying data representations.  My *eye* can perceive
detail and my ear can probably hear "perfect" pitch (assuming
I'm not defective genetically).  So the "condensing" of
information for higher level consideration may involve some
information loss.

<p>
Now the math ability is interesting, since there is no evolutionary
argument that complex mathematics is selected for in any way.
(Simple counting maybe, square roots or complex divisions very doubtful.)
So *either* the brain is so general that it can absorb and overlay
math on other sub-processes *or* the argument is correct that the
math savants are recruiting larger brain regions for the job.

<p>
So perhaps, depending on the skill, there are different factors
at work.

<p>
But *highly* fascinating given the possibility that devices,
drugs or nanobots could turn these processing skills on or
off on demand!
