FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         October 11, 1999

GALILEO SUCCEEDS IN HISTORIC FLYBY OF JUPITER'S VOLCANIC MOON      

     NASA's Galileo spacecraft has successfully zipped past 
</pre>
Jupiter's moon Io, the most volcanic body in our solar system. 

<p>
     Instruments onboard the spacecraft peered down at Io from an 
altitude of only 611 kilometers (380 miles) at 10:06 p.m. Pacific 
Daylight Time on Sunday.  This was the closest look at Io by any 
spacecraft, and Galileo's cameras were poised to capture the 
brief encounter.  

<p>
     If all goes as planned, the data will be transmitted to 
Earth over the next several weeks and then will undergo 
processing by mission scientists.  New pictures would then be 
released at a press briefing tentatively scheduled next month.

<p>
     "We're thrilled that the spacecraft handled this flyby so <br>
well, particularly because it had to endure a strong dose of 
radiation from Jupiter," said Jim Erickson, Galileo project 
manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA.  "It 
appears at this point that everything went well."

<p>
     Because Io is the innermost of Jupiter's moons, it lies in a 
region with the highest levels of radiation from Jupiter, which 
can wreak havoc with spacecraft instruments.

<p>
     During this Io flyby, it appears the radiation did trigger 
an error of the onboard computer's memory, which put the 
spacecraft in a "safe mode," halting all non-essential activities 
while awaiting further commands from the ground.  That occurred 
Sunday morning at 3:09 a.m Pacific time.  Galileo engineers 
scrambled to prepare new commands to help the spacecraft work 
around the problem.  The commands were transmitted to the 
spacecraft late Sunday afternoon, they worked as hoped, and 
Galileo resumed full operations at 8 p.m. Pacific time, just two 
hours before the Io flyby.

<p>
     "It was a heroic effort to pull this off, "Erickson said.  <br>
"The team diagnosed and corrected a problem we'd never come 
across before, and they put things back on track."

<p>
     "We look forward to seeing the closest-ever pictures of Io," <br>
said Dr. Duane Bindschadler, Galileo manager of science 
operations and planning.  "We want to learn more about the 
differences and similarities between volcanoes on Io and 
volcanoes on Earth."  During the flyby, Galileo's science 
instruments studied the surface chemistry, heat, gravity and 
magnetic properties of Io.  

<p>
     The flyby took place while Galileo was 598 million 
kilometers (372 million miles) from Earth.  A second, closer 
flyby of Io by Galileo is planned for the evening of November 25 
Pacific time (November 26 Eastern time) at an altitude of 300 
kilometers (186 miles).

<p>
     Additional information about the Galileo mission is 
available on the Galileo home page at a new web address of 
<a href="http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov">http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov</a> .

<p>
     JPL manages the Galileo mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C.  JPL is operated for NASA by the 
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.
