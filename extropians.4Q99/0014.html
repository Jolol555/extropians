<p>
Assuming you refer to "technophilia", my neologism implied a pathological
attraction to, or obsession with, an object (c.f. necrophilia) -- in this
case a neurotic absorption in technology or the artifacts of sensation
(with apologies to the American Psychiatric Association).

<p>
Being quite new to the Transhumanist Ideology and Ethos, I can only
recall that the term "meme" was introduced by the Oxford zoologist
Richard Dawkins to denote the cultural equivalent of genes; ideas and
collective phenomena took on a life of their own within society and,
along with genes, affected the progress of human evolution. I'm sure
this is a very inadequate or erroneous rendering, but I suppose "memes",
like genes, are subject to the vagaries of mutation and could become
grotesque psychological equivalents of defective genetic material.

<a name="0035qlink1">I am not a biologist, so I am not aware of anything that could "infect" 
a meme, although for all I know they could be vulnerable to a virtual 
neurological virus and become neuropathic, or, for that matter, exhibit
unseemly virtual warts or other unwanted excrescences.</a>
