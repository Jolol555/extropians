Representative Bob Barr Demands a Report on "Project Echelon"
The following is a release from Rep. Barr's office:

<p>
BARR MOVES TO EXPOSE "PROJECT ECHELON"
<br>
HOUSE ACTS TO REQUIRE SURVEILLANCE REPORT

<p>
<a name="2194qlink1">        WASHINGTON, DC -- According to reports to the European
Parliament and others, a multi-national system known as Project Echelon
intercepts phone calls, faxes, e-mails, and radio transmissions from
around the world.  Some two million such communications per hour are
reportedly intercepted.  This information is then reportedly routed to
intelligence agencies, which search it for particular information</a> of
interest.

<p>
        Under language Barr added to the Foreign Intelligence
Authorization Act for FY 2000, adopted today by the full House, the
National Security Agency (NSA) which manages Project Echelon, the CIA
and the Department of Justice, will have 60 days to report to Congress
on the legal standards they use on communications intercepts involving
American citizens.

<p>
        "If American intelligence agencies are intercepting, receiving<br>
or distributing communications involving our citizens without court
orders, or legal authority, they are doing so outside the bounds of the
Constitution.  If Project Echelon exists as reported, all Americans who
care about the integrity of our Constitution should be concerned,"
declared Barr.

<p>
        "Everyone who places a high value on our right to privacy should<br>
be encouraged the House of Representatives has today taken the first
step toward requiring the Intelligence Community to prove adequate
procedures are in place to protect that right," said Barr.

<p>
        "I strongly encourage the Intelligence Community to prepare this<br>
report using unclassified material whenever possible.  As more and more
Americans become concerned about threats to their privacy, the
reassurances only a public report can provide are essential.  Our
intelligence agencies need public support to do their jobs effectively,
and this amendment provides an important opportunity for them to boost
that support by answering our questions honestly," Barr concluded.

<p>
        Barr, a former CIA official and United States Attorney, serves
on the House Judiciary and Government Reform Committees.  Government
Reform Chairman Dan Burton has also committed to hold hearings on this
matter.
