Excellent point to open with.  Someone could use a short version of this in
a panel debate with a neoludd proponent.

<a href="0304.html#0330qlink2">&gt;This rhetorical technique is valuable when proposing a variety of</a><br>

It's taught as basic media advocacy strategy, part of the general set of
techniques referred to as 'staying on message no matter what'.  When this
kind of attack is mounted, one of the goals of it is to get you to waste
your precious thirty seconds of camera time in defensive posturing.  Then,
the opponent's message is the one the audience tends to remember.  The text
above provides a guide to inserting a positive message from the second you
start to speak (or write, if it's a chat line interview).

Thank you, Hal and Robert, for taking the time to address this.

<p>
And, yes, 'meat' probably works best in personal conversations only,
despite its wonderfully vivid conveyance of a central idea.
