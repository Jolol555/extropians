<i>&gt;are you saying we atheists "occasionally" doubt "all the time"?</i><br>

<p>
ok, forgive me for my accidental contradiction. let's back up.
if i have "faith" in someone, it is not because i just "wanted" to 
believe in them, it's because experience has given me reasonable 
confidence that they are trustworthy. this is faith.
if religions adhere to a belief system which is totally irrational, it's 
not because they have "faith", it's because they're ignorant, or just 
haven't taken the trouble to think logically. this is not faith by any 
conventional definition.
