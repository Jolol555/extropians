"Well, we have all heard of Arthur C. Clarke. Only a monolith that may have 
been left abandoned by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization on the moon 
for the past four million years awaiting the first physical contact with a 
human astronaut to send away a beacon announcing to its creators that the 
species on that nearby beautiful blue planet has at last become a 
space-faring one.. ..; could possibly be oblivious to the Deep Impact caused 
on our space-age civilization by the man who invented (sic) the geo- 
synchronous satellite, foresaw the internet, commented live on TV during the 
first (official) human landing on the moon, and, of course, wrote a little 
script for a weird psychedelic film based on one of his most obscure short 
stories that would soon become the best science-fiction film of all time: 
2001: A Space Odyssey."

What does this blubbering swill mean, anyway?

<p>
Break out the rotgut.

<p>
Unbridled enthusiasm, unshared, has lain waste to your technique, child.  
Stream of consciousness is the beginning of writing, not the end.  

<p>
My advice:


<OL>
  <li>  Take a class.  Or,

  <li>  Take what you've got and rewrite it, half as long.  Then write it again, 
half as long, again.  Then throw it away.


</OL>
<p>
And god, stop wasting our time.
