<a name="2430qlink1">Longer lifespan with no disadvantages would be selected for, roughly to the 
point where only a negligeable number of mice would survive that long due to 
other causes (a lot less than 200 years, I'd think).  If the effects of the 
gene are more complex (only works if a particular set is in the organism, 
useless or harmful otherwise) then selection is less reliable, hence weaker 
and the effect "gives out" earlier.</a>  

<p>
<a name="2430qlink2">Of course longer lifespan may have costs.  In the Rose lab, the long-lived 
strains take longer to develop and lay fewer eggs in the first part of life.</a>

Big size can be either good or bad, so it's hard to say in general.  Big as 
an elephant would, I think, be very bad. Little mice are doing very well 
while the only land animal as big as an elephant (the elephant :-) will be 
extinct in the wild in a few decades if humans don't save the ranges.
