<p>
<a name="0773qlink1">I'm joining into the choir of "Why a party?!". It doesn't really make
sense to make a transhumanist or extropian party, because our views
are not all-encompassing: what is transhumanist labour policy? How
would an extropian foreign policy look like?</a>

<p>
What we can (and should) think of is what issues and ideas that are
relevant to us we would like to see in the party programs around the
world. That is a good start; in the long run the current politicial
systems are going to go away, but at that point the future forms of
transhumanism will hopefully be around, influencing whatever polities
exist then.

<p>
My guess is that the issues of high interest for transhumanists in
politics are mainly education (making it better, more widespread and
more usable) and freedom (especially morphological and economic
freedom).  Technology and environmental issues may come up too, of
course, but they are not as central and in many cases sub-issues fall
under the freedom part.
