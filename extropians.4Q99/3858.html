<p>
There have been many answers.  All of the intelligent and imaginative 
<a name="3902qlink1">response has been educational and enlightening.  I'm still pondering, 
however, whether AI's could actually be more intelligent than us,</a> maybe 
<a name="3902qlink2">faster (billions of times faster) thus calculating and processing data that 
would currently take us life times, but intelligence seems to be determined 
by our own human belief systems.  We would still pose the questions</a> for the 
AI to solve and interpret it's findings.  I hold quality of life and maximum 
longevity (as long as it remains quality) as my highest priorities.  If an 
AI could serve these better, I say 'Hell yeah!,' but if AIs encroach upon 
the quality of my life (by stating that the most inelligent action is to 
kill myself, or enslaving me, or even making me feel like an inferior being) 
  What's the point?  If Frankenstein curiosity is the motive for creating 
AI's, then the analogy of the racoon who who can't let go of the object of 
curiosity comes to mind.  He won't let go and pull his paw from the jar of 
nails even when the hunter approaches with a loaded gun.
