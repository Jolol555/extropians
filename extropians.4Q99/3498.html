I will be enjoying dinner with a large group of friends at a fine Basque
restaurant located in a small town in Nevada.  Followed, of course, by
moderate amounts of drinking at the local casinos.  If I wasn't there, I'd
probably be at home with the same friends.

<p>
A primary goal in my plans is to generally avoid the areas that are likely
to be Schelling points for idiots looking to create mayhem.  I don't
expect too many problems in my neck of the woods, but don't want to
become a victim of statistics either.  &lt;shrug&gt;.  There are definitely a
few places that I certainly would not want to be e.g. Los Angeles or New
York.  

<p>
In any case I am expecting the government to over-react to whatever
problems may occur; I expect there will be a some computer problems and
lots of people problems, but who knows.  I think caution is prudent.
