The medical opinion I solicited considers the risk vanishingly small.  The slightly
controversial aspect concerns the BENEFITS.  If insurable, it would certainly
be reasonable to obtain this treatment on merely heuristic grounds; but as
this is not the case, in my opinion your options are: [1] talk therapy; [2] a
new pharmacological regimen, perhaps combined with [1]; [3] transcranial
magnetic therapy; [4] ECT, perhaps limited to a unilateral application which
causes virtually no transient disorientation and which now is associated with
NO seizure activity; [5] a meditational approach, e.g. joining a local ZEN
community.  Some extropian List members may have additional suggestions
and as extropians reject [5] as a desirable option.

<p>
Please know that the worst case scenario for unilateral ECT is being convinced
 that the recovery room is full of onions (the smell of onions is a
universal response), feeling sleepy, and perhaps crying for a little while.
Except for somnolence, the mechanisms for these reactions is, as they
euphemistically say, "poorly understood", i.e. they haven't the foggiest
idea.

<p>
Good luck,

<p>
Bob
