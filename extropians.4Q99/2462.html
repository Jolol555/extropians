Not anytime soon.  "Make faster computers" is more like "make more efficient
factories" than "make faster airplanes", in that it allows a great deal of
latitude in taking different approaches to get around physical constraints.
Currently we don't see any hard limits on what is possible until you reach
the realm of large-scale nanocomputer networks, and minds with that kind of
hardware to work with would be so far ahead of us that it seems unlikely
that we could accurately predict their limitations.

The current trend is in the opposite direction.  Increasing automation
allows you to replace inefficient human interaction with ever more efficient
types of software interaction, which give huge increases overall efficiency.
Again, I don't see a hard limit until the system becomes so fast that light
speed delays are the limiting factor, and that doesn't happen until you've
gone well beyond most people's concept of a post-singularity world.
