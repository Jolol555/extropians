Hi!

<a name="3821qlink1">I didn't know you were such a big fan of the telomerase theory!</a> However,
<a name="3821qlink2">the truth is that, unlike the free radical theory, the telomerase theory is
a cellular, in vitro, theory, not an organismic one.</a>  Also, don't you think
<a name="3821qlink3">research based on Hayflick's limit (as most telomerase research is) can be
biased? How do you explain that cells taken from species that appear not to
age also follow Hayflick's limit and also have a latent period in
accordance with donor age.</a> In addition, there is  evidence indicating that
<a name="3821qlink4">telomerase is not the only enzyme controlling telomere lenght.</a>

<p>
Anyway, I'm just curious and decided to post my once-every-six-months e-mail.

<p>
Hasta.
