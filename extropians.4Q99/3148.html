As soon as this gets passed, I'll be the first person to help extend
the HTTP/FTP/TELNET protocols so you can send encrypted email via
alternate methods.  If you send it in an encrypted format there is
absolutely no way anyone can tell whether it is email, a file,
some text I am typing or a page of hypertext.  You cannot tax
content, bits are bits, you can only tax the connection by
the number you have, the time you are connected or the volume
of data sent.</a>

<p>
If they pass this law, then people work around it, then they pass
another law saying you have to send email in an "open", "taxable"
format the people will be demonstrating in the streets.

<p>
The genie is out of the bottle and you can't put it back...
