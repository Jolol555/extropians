Aspiring nanotechers and nanotechesses may want to look at the current
Scientific American Amateur Scientist column, available online at
<a href="http://www.sciam.com/1999/1099issue/1099amsci.html">http://www.sciam.com/1999/1099issue/1099amsci.html</a>.  If you follow the
links at the bottom you can download a special demo version of a pretty
nifty-sounding molecular modelling program from Stark Designs.  Here is
an excerpt from the article:

<p>
   But Molecular Dynamics takes this all to a new level. It allows you to
   conduct an impressive array of virtual experiments to see how different
   atoms interact under all kinds of conditions. The program consists
   of numerous modules that demonstrate diffusion, osmotic pressure, the
   relation between temperature and pressure, the distribution of molecular
   speeds in a gas and many other topics. And you can use the software to
   discover things that even the most mathematically gifted physicist would
   be hard-pressed to wrestle from the basic theory.

<p>
   The simulation runs so fast that when I first saw it at a conference
   I was certain it was a trick. The presenter put about 50 each of four
   different kinds of electrically neutral atoms inside a three-dimensional
   volume. The particle positions updated so quickly that I thought it
   had to be a computer movie, not a real-time simulation. So I decided to
   challenge the fellow.

<p>
   In nature even neutral atoms can bond together. The mutual repulsion of
   the orbital electrons polarizes the atoms, and it turns out there is a
   range of distances over which these polarized atoms are attracted. So
   I asked the presenter to add these electrostatic interactions and
   then slowly decrease the temperature. He did. The heavier atoms began
   clumping together while the lighter ones kept speeding about, just as
   they should. He then rapidly brought the temperature to zero. The free
   atoms settled into small isolated clumps, again just as they should. That
   made me a believer.

<p>
I just downloaded the software but haven't tried it yet.  It apparently
has a number of "modules" that run specific simulations.  I don't think
you can create arbitrary scenarios with the demo software (no Drexlerian
nanosynthesis modules yet probably).  But it sounds like it might be fun.
