<a name="2230qlink1">	Having spent six years in the US Navy's surface fleet I can and do
assure you the US Navy considers air conditioning _very_ important. Its
first value is cooling high-powered electronics. Compartments containing
radar sets and communications equipment are generally colder than any
other place aboard except refrigerators. Air conditioning's second value
is crew comfort. If you lived with fifty other people in a space little
larger than a two bedroom apartment, the only way to combat odor is air
conditioning. Finally, an all-metal ship absorbs a good deal of heat.
Without air conditioning, the structure becomes dangerously warm and
people inside it for extended periods risk heat exhuastion.</a>
