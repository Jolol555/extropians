:-) Yes, I think your reasoning is right.<a name="1105qlink1"> My parents gave me a very
free upbringing, without influencing my values deliberately. While
they were not fundamentalists, they were rather politically left at
the start. The only exception to not influencing me was when they gave
me the Quotations of Chairman Mao (maybe as an experiment). I didn't
find it interesting. On the other hand, they also tried to give me
some economics textbooks, which I didn't get either. I was far too
happy reading encyclopedias.</a>
