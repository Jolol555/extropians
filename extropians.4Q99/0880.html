With currently existing weapons this is not true at all.  The actual kill
zone for a nuclear device of normal size (i.e. 50KT - 1 MT) is actually
fairly small, compared to the scale of a continent.  Fallout will certainly
kill a lot of people, but the worst effects are still relatively localized.
If America set off its entire existing arsanel right where it now sits</a> the
net result would be a few million dead Americans, greatly elevated cancer
rates in North America for several decades, and modestly elevated cancer
rates over large portions of the northern hemisphere for a few years.

<p>
Of course, we could build much bigger (and dirtier) bombs if we wanted to,
but it doesn't really make sense to do so.  An arsanel capable of wiping us
out would be pretty much useless for anything else, and it would be
expensive enough to be beyond the reach of a lone madman (even if he happens
to be a Third-World dictator).

<p>
Mind you, this is just the situation today.  A single planet doesn't give
you much breathing space when you start looking at the kinds of weapons that
will be feasible in the early nanotech age (or even just before then).  If
Eli's AI scheme doesn't work out, it is going to be a real race to get
ourselves off this rock before it becomes impossible for two hostile
factions to survive on it.  But that's a different (and rather long)
topic...
