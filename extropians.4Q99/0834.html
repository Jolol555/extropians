The essay as a whole contains no real misrepresentation of facts,
because it isn't about facts--it's just an ethical credo expressed
by the device of speculating on the outcome of its opposite.  But
his speculations are no more believable than anyone else's, so it
is likely that he is just preaching to the choir of those already
disposed to share his values.  The most telling line is this:

<p>
<a href="0831.html#0834qlink1">&gt; No objective standard of value is possible unless it is</a><br>
<i>&gt; grounded in nature, i.e. in objective reality.</i><br>

<p>
Now this is something with which I wholeheartedly agree.  His
problem is that he then paints "nature" as if it is a static
description of how things are--how we are.  This completely
ignores, even villifies, the simple objective fact that nature
/is/ change.  Nature /is/ progress and evolution.  Standards
of value must grow and evolve as we do, or else we will be
stuck with the same "humanity" that caused wars and genocides
and ignorance and poverty.

<p>
He is distressed that we don't respect "humanity", and he is
right: much of human nature doesn't deserve respect, and we are
not afraid to say so.  But it is also human nature to improve,
to grow, to learn from the mistakes of history.  He recoils
at the unpredictable future if technology is allowed to change
human nature without limits, and again he is right: none of us
knows what such a future will hold.  But failing to use these
technologies intelligently is just as scary and unpredictable.
The technologies will be discovered either way; if humanity is
not prepared for them, and still retains its evolution-hardened
violent nature, it is the overcautious humans who will destroy
themselves, not us.
