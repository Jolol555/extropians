<i>&gt; &gt; Personally I think a world without work would be pretty boring, I seem</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; deal of work needs some type of consciousness.  Something that can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; create, explore possible solutions, and employ creativity to solving</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; paid you got a race of slaves.  Abolishment of work is just a warm fuzzy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; utopian idea that will never probably work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We don't have to abolish work, but in a very wealthy society we should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be able to remove most of the penalties associated with not working.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; People who enjoy work would always have stimulating projects to devote</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves to, and those of us who feel like partying for a few hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousand years should be able to do that at a reasonable standard of</i><br>
<i>&gt; living.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And if all that endless leisure gets boring, we can always get some</i><br>
<i>&gt; training and go back to work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
If you are talking about a society in which 9/10ths of the work in
society is done by automation/nanotech, etc..., then I'm all for it.
However such a society should also be able to afford not to have to tax
those who do the remaining 1/10th of the work....
