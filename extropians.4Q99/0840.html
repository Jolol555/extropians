 I doubt that anything has a chance if it avoids Intel compatability and
Microsoft compatability at the same time.
 I'd guess that there's currently a 40% chance that Linux or something
similar will beat Microsoft. My estimate would drop below 10% if Intel
and Microsoft merged with no regulatory strings attached.

 Ok, you've convinced me that they should set prices as if they were
a single firm. My objections are to letting them develop standards as
a single firm. It looks like we would probably both be satisfied if
they were encouraged to collude on pricing, but not allowed to merge.
