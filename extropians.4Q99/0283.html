 Maybe the next logical step would be not how stylish you are -
 everybody is stylish thanks to downloadable skills and appearance -
 but which style you have, how well it interacts with the other styles
 around you and your circumstances. In short, meta-style. &gt;&gt;

<a name="0310qlink1"><a name="0293qlink1">    Meta-style....yeah, I like that, I like that a lot.  You might use your 
personal style as your base, and then adapt from there to integrate with the 
styles in the social situation.  It would be a merging of styles, creating

something new, yet organic.  That might indeed be fun.  I would still want to 
on occasion try complete immersion in the style of others, and probably would 
often touch base with my own concept of style, immersing myself in the 
environment I consider most me (or most in keeping with my mood).  But 
meta-style would be where we all meet and learn from one another.
