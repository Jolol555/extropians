<a href="0193.html#0204qlink1">&lt;&lt; My chief concern, however, as a motorcycle rider is that very few of the </a><br>
 lights respond to my 630 pound bike.  Thus, I am forced to run red lights or 
 turn signals every day, or spend excessive time waiting for a car to trigger 
 the light.  A local bike shop owner was actually cited for this a few years 
 ago and discovered that the law in CA actually takes this into account.  If 
 the light doesn't respond, then you have the right to proceed with caution, 
 under CA's "reasonable person" basic driving law. &gt;&gt;

<a name="0217qlink1">Hmmm, maybe if we could add a basic pattern recognition program to the video 
cameras at the stop signals that could recognize a motorcycle and hook it to 
the light so it would trigger a change of the signal light, then we might 
change what is currently an adverse technology for motorcyclists into an 
asset for them.  Of course, they could instead try and adjust the detectors 
for lighter loads, but it might be cheaper and easier to use the video 
instead of tearing up the intersections.</a>
