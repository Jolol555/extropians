&lt;&lt; Strictly speaking, that would not be uplifting, though it might be an
 interesting project in itself.
 
<p>
 However, I think this would be much harder than just uplifiting octopodes
 and it's fraught with moral issues, since we already know (or believe:)
 humans are sentient.  The jury is still out on octopodes.:)

Wouldn't it be uplifting?<a name="3090qlink2">  For example, let's say I want to develop some form 
of language faculty in Octopodes.  I think I would be likely</a> to pattern their 
<a name="3090qlink3">linguistic ability on our own language abilities, rather than develop one 
from scratch based solely on current octopod communication.  I would</a> say this 
<a name="3090qlink4">still falls within uplifting, though it does also make the octopod more 
<br>
</a>"human-like".<br>
