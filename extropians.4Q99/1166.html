<a href="1146.html#1166qlink1">&gt;My critiques of atheistic criticisms is that its mono-cultural. How many of</a><br>
<i>&gt;you have steeped yourselves in Hindu or Buddhism, before your reject it? I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't mean, merely read books about it, but spoken with people who know </i><br>
<i>&gt;their</i><br>
<i>&gt;faith?  How many know what the belief systems of one billion Muslims are,</i><br>
<i>&gt;beyond media snippets?  Judeo-Christian is largely an academic word, since</i><br>
<i>&gt;their are no Judeo's. The Jew's  belief differ markedly form what is </i><br>
<i>&gt;normally</i><br>
<i>&gt;taught. How about Confucianism or Taoism (hat-tip to Fritjof Capra).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Zoroastrianism, New Age, and so much more.</i><br>

<a name="1175qlink2">Sorry for being so blunt, but what you ask is absolutely absurd.  "Just try 
<a name="1193qlink1">it" bull shit stupid Christians try to pull all the time.  Look at it this 
</a>way.  Say I have a drug that will completely take away your ability and 
desire to have sex.  So just try it, it doesn't matter if you desire sex now 
because you won't desire it after you take this pill.  Why would I trick 
myself into believing complete non-since?  That would be the most stupid 
thing a person could do.</a>
