<a name="0405qlink1">Actually, no you cannot always purchase or make your own silencers.
While the ATF does not regard airguns as firearms, so the National
Firearms Act does not apply to silencers that are only useful with
airguns (I don't know how you could make them only useful for airguns
and not useful for firearms using the same caliber), but several States
DO regard airguns as firearms. Massachusetts is one, and silencers are
quite illegal (despite the overbearing presence of noise ordinances)
there, actually they might be more difficult to get, since theoretically
you can get a real silencer by going through the Class III Restricted
Weapons Tax Form 4 process with the ATF, but since the ATF doesn't
recognise airguns as firearms, they would not accept a Form 4 on a
silencer for an airgun as a device that requires such a transfer process
and fee (The transfer tax is $200.00). Funny how government</a> is.
