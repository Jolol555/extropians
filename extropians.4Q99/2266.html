Which is why the US and the USSR agreed somewhere in the
1960's ('70s?) that they would not build defensive weapons
to shoot down each others missiles.

Enemies or not, your own political and economical survival 
is always more important than the demise of the enemy.
Especially when multiple parties are involved.

It's not about it being peaceful. The point is that the wars
in Renaissance Italy were:
<br>
- nondestructive
<br>
- about economics, with hardly any fighting going
  on if there wasn't something to be gained
- not threatening to the 'stability' of Italy as
  a whole
<br>
- a pretty good incentive to encourage new inventions,
  economical advances, science and art

<p>
While the time may not have been a peaceful one for the
citizens of that time, it has been a very good time for
the development of the country as a whole (and for the
culture we still have today!).
