You might be interested, Phil, in "The Neurobiology of Morals" by Charles
Jennings to provide a test case for the application of your judgments and
assess whether you still conclude that Robert's (i.e. Moravec's) proposal
is conceptually inadequate.  The online paper features the research of
Anderson, S.W., Bechara, A., Damasio, H., Tranel, D. &amp; Damasio, A.R.
"Impairment of social and moral behavior related to early damage in
human prefrontal cortex", Nature Neuroscience 2, 1032-1037 (1999).

<p>
I agree that neuron replacement as an exclusive strategy for the construction
 of synthetic intelligence ("human mentality" including both
cognition and conation) is probably insufficient.<a name="1562qlink2"> But Robert's claim that
</a>
neuron replacement is feasible I find reasonable.<a name="1562qlink3"> So do you regard the 
</a>
synthesis of neurotransmitter chemistry impossible?  The cybernetic
<a name="1562qlink4">aspect of e.g. signal control requires the operation of antagonistic
agents -- is it possible to simulate the control mechanisms which 
regulate the release and re-uptake of, say, serotonin by monoamine 
oxidase chemistry? Or do you think these feedback processes are so
complex that we simply cannot artificially replicate them?</a>

<p>
There is also in this paper a brief discussion of the relationship
of prefrontal cortical damage to the etiology of sociopathy.
