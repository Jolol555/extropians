<a href="0737.html#0756qlink2">&gt;&gt;Lee Daniel Crocker made sense to me:</a><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;I suppose if you really stretched the limits of the language you might</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;be able to interpret that as an accusation that you've ignored earlier</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;efforts for some unspecified reason, but I certainly don't read it that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;way.  It reads to me like just idle chest-pounding:  Hey!  Look at me!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;I've done that too! </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I think Natasha was pointing out what had already been done and was being</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;done. Probably a good idea since Kathryn seems to see us as enemies</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(something entirely of her creation) and so we can't expect to receive any</i><br>
<a name="0758qlink2"><i>&gt;&gt;credit from her.</i><br>
