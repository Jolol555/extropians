("political

more

<p>
I agree with you that much that has formerly been seen as fundamental will 
become instrumental - i.e. we will be able to DO the things we choose to do 
better and with fewer compromises.  But the insight upon which the basic 
concepts of transhumanism are based ultimately makes appeals to "how human 
brains function" a challenging basis for a value system.  Satisfying the 
<a name="2162qlink3">needs of "human nature" becomes a shaky foundation when that nature becomes 
</a>mutable.<a name="2162qlink4">  Your formulation above reveals that you seem to value "extending 
and amplifying our sentience" as a fundamental value.  I do, too.  But 
explicating WHY that is a fundamental value is important and may well not be 
within the realm addressable by the scientific method.</a>
