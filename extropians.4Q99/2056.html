I'm pretty sure this page is a joke.  Check out this brilliant economic
observation from the "Socioeconomic Impact of Transhumanism":

<p>
          "Some might say that as these technologies are explored more
fully, the cost would decrease.  While economics typically supports
this, the fact that transhumanism relies on theoretical technologies and
their continuing refinement makes this untrue.  Continual refinement
costs a great deal of money, and the fact that the technology does not
yet exist doesn't lower the cost."

<p>
Wow, that's a doozy.

<p>
...although now I've I just read a post by Bryan Moss pointing to the <br>
university class this assignment was created for -- a 300-level course,
no less.  On the bright side, it sounds like a fun course!  I wish we
had courses like that.

<p>
Geoff.
