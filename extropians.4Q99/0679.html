I actually hold a similar opinion with respect to pornography in general.
I am not into spectator sports as I consider them to be such a pale shade
of participation that it is usually not worth the time spent.  In a more
<a name="0717qlink1">general sense, I've never been interested in living any part of my life in
a third person role.</a>  Considering the fact that one could experience the
much, much richer first person experience with roughly the same investment
in time, I personally do not understand the fascination with nude
photographs either.
