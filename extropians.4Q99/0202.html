If they had about 10 pounds of Plutonium any physics graduate student

A bomb, and over a thousand tons of the element  has been made and, like
it or not, more is being manufactured every day in every nuclear power plant
on earth. An H bomb would be more difficult but not impossible for a dedicated
sub national group, but why bother building your own bomb? The former USSR
made over 50,000 H bombs, I'd like to think that every single one is guarded
by somebody who is not drunk and can't be bribed, but Russia is a madhouse and...

Rockets would be a foolish way to deploy a biological weapon,  they're
very expensive and germs are a poor mans weapon, more important,
everybody would know who sent it. Better to have a suicidal agent open
a small box in the middle of Manhattan. Anthrax is a little old fashioned too.

<a name="0210qlink3">Ebola Zaire kills (quite horribly) 90% of those infected, there is
no treatment and none is likely anytime soon.</a> If you're in contact
with the blood of somebody infected you'll probably get it but otherwise
you're safe, and because it kills so quickly epidemics don't spread far
from their point of origin. There is a slightly different strain called
Ebola Reston that's deadly to chimps but harmless to people, it
does have an interesting property however, it's airborn and as contagious
as the common cold.<a name="0210qlink4"> I'll bet it would be easy for genetic engineers to
combine the best properties of both strains, easier than making a smarter
mouse anyway. To quote Doctor Strangelove, "all it takes for realization
is the will to do so".</a>

<p>
<a name="0516qlink1">Incidentally, the horror novelist Stephan King said that the nonfiction book
"The Hot Zone" by Richard Preston about a Ebola epidemic in Africa was
the most horrifying and gruesome book he ever read. I agree, It seems like
it took me forever to finish it, I could only take a little at a time.</a> Below is a
<a name="0516qlink2">brief quotation, the damn thing goes on like this for page after page:

<p>
"The only sound is a choking in his throat as he continues to vomit while
 unconscious. Then comes a sound like a bedsheet being torn in half,
 which is the sound of his bowels opening at the sphincter</a> and venting blood.
<a name="0516qlink3">The blood is mixed with his intestinal lining. He has sloughed off his gut.
The lining of his intestines have come off and are being expelled along
 with huge amounts of blood."</a>
