We're almost certainly not talking about MD-scale simulation here
(through the high watermark of a billion-atom simulation of Cu
crystals have been achieved, and I'm pretty confident that we can put
a cubic micron of a biological system into the machine, and look at 1
ns dynamics of it brute force (and much longer time spans with
tricks)) within the next decade.

<p>
In principle, if you could integrate these two current complementary
packages

it would be probably up to the challenge of making a pretty good model 
of a minimal organism.
