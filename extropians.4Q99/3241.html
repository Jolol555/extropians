Cynthia,

<p>
A good point, a steady job history is the single biggest factor for most
applications for credit.  Only a net worth far above average will get
you new credit if you have no job history.

<p>
My post was more to do with interest rates that are charged once you
have credit. Also 20K in the bank does not in itself mean someone has a
positive net worth or is credit worthy.  Not refering to you, but people
applying for credit in general.
