Discouraging it may be, but hardly surprising.  Reporters and editors tend to 
use words in the way that they think the words will be understood.  Thus the 
word "liberal" is invariably used to mean statist left-leaning politics and 
ideology in the US with such universality that even scholarly writers usually 
feel they have to qualify their use of the word with the term "classical" 
when they employ it in its original sense.  That term has become</a> effectively 
lost to public discourse in its original meaning, such that many people feel 
they have to use the word "libertarian" now to express what "liberal" used to 
mean.

<p>
With regard to the word "anarchist", for better or worse, the way it is often 
used here is very, very far outside the mainstream usage of the word.  Even 
for fairly well educated people, the word connotes bomb-throwing crazies.
