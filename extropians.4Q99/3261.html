haaaa ha ha haaaa EvMick I got a huuuuge laugh outta that comment.  Its
so true.  The thing that sticks most in my mind is the safety courses they
made us take.  They had regular radiation alarm drills.  They made us
sign about 50 different forms saying that we understood: if the radiation
alarm went off, we *would not panic*, we would stay put, not run
screaming, Homer Simpson-esque, for if one did so, the teenagers with
<a name="3263qlink1">machine guns would be forced to assume the running screamer was
attempting to abscond with some plutonium, and would be forced to
take appropriate action to prevent this.  They didnt wish to explain
any bullet riddled rocket scientists.</a>  {8^D  spike
