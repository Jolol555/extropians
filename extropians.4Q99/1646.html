<p>
The keyword is IF.....the millions of dollars spent on asbestos abatement 
caused more danger than if the whole "problem" had been ignored.

<p>
<a href="1637.html#1646qlink2">&gt;    Ozone: Direct effects observed in animals and perhaps humans</a><br>

<p>
I disagree.  I contend that the so called effects are the result of something 
else....like pinkeye causing the sheep to go blind which was eroneously 
attributed to UV in AlGore's Comic Opera "Earth in the Balance"....in point 
of fact the UV level at ground level has NOT been observed as being any 
higher than ever before...lower if anything.

<p>
Actually I kinda like the idea of global warming.  (ask someone</a> in the Point 
<a name="1663qlink2">Barrow Alaska).  Look at a map....notice how MUCH land there</a> is that is not 
<a name="1663qlink3">available due to weather extremes.  Have you ever been to northern</a> montana in 
<a name="1663qlink4">the winter?  And I was in North Carolina....shortly after Hurricane Mitch.  
What they had was a hurricane...it is only conjecture that it was</a> caused by 
<a name="1663qlink5">global warming......which is also a conjecture since hard data does not 
indicate it's presence....</a>

<p>
And another thing....IF (and i say if) there is global warming.....is it 
perhaps finally returning to the temps that are actually normal....prior to 
the Alvarez dino-killer (tounge firmly in cheek).....

<a href="1637.html#1646qlink4">&gt;    Nuclear Winter: There are still lots of weapons out there.</a><br>

<p>
The scientists who first concocted this idea have recanted.  The confessed 
that it was all a ruse to cut back on nukes.  Of course their cause was 
JUST.....so the prostitution of their chosen profession was ok.  (hallelujah)
