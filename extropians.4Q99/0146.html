<i>&gt; &gt; to entry to or exit from Microsoft programming.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since Microsoft doesn't make computers, I assume you meant 'Intel machines'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ever hear of the DEC Alpha?  Early versions tended to be 2-3 times faster</i><br>

<i>&gt; potential to invade the workstation software market.  So, they ported</i><br>
<i>&gt; Windows NT, all of their server software, and some of their desktop programs</i><br>
<i>&gt; to work on the new chip.  Unfortunately, Alpha machines ended up being much</i><br>

<i>&gt; wanted to pay that much extra.  As a result the Alpha never really caught</i><br>
<i>&gt; on, and it is probably doomed to remain a niche market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Moral: Microsoft is perfectly willing to write software for any hardware</i><br>

You're correct, except more or less when I wrote Windows machines I meant Intel
architecture (Intel, Cyrix, AMD) running Windows.  They significiantly outnumber
Alpha machines.  I read recently in the NT Insider that Alpha support is being
dropped, then it will truly only be Windows on 8086 architecture machines.  It
was noted in the source about that that dropping Alpha was unconfirmed.  Alpha
users will have to use Digital UNIX.

<p>
Then again, there is planned support for the Merced chip.  Linux is already
running on Merced or a Merced simulator.

<p>
Microsoft does have a successful suite of software running on Macintosh
machines.
