Why would we want to transcend them?  Any more than "transcending" pain?  
These are valuable signals that give us a wealth of information about how 
our actions and their outcomes reflect our values and our capabilities in 
the real world - or the real virtual world.

<p>
I personally LIKE giving offense - to the right people.  People who want to 
live lies and force me to cowtow to their fantasies by censoring my own 
views so as to be PC, for example.  If those people get offended enough to 
leave or filter out my input, then I have accomplished something positive.  
As one of my heros - a woman, by the way - Maria Montessori, put it, "It is 
just as important and valuable to destroy a great evil as to create a great 
good."

<p>
In the libertarian movement of the mid-70's, when the major players were 
still young and active and things were still hopeful for an early 
revolution, the Association of Libertarian Feminists was formed.  One of the 
first things they did was have a big debate - and a vote! - on whether 
libertarianism was in fact compatible with feminism, on the premise that if 
it wasn't, too bad for libertarianism...  The embarrassing thing is that we 
didn't kick those sexist idiots out right at the start, but young guys are 
so horny that they will put up with almost anything.

<p>
Soon thereafter, these same women started volunteering to run everything and 
bringing in their friends, which meant the death of several once very 
stimulating and innovative libertarian supper clubs as real hard debate over 
issues got lost in the social noise level.  Perhaps we should create dummy 
organizations just to attract such people and convince them what a wonderful 
job they are doing and generally keep them too busy to do real harm.  Then 
we could have like an extropic Masons, the in-crowd, the real conspiracy to 
get things done.  Or have I given away too much...
