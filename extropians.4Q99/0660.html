<a name="0669qlink1">Eliezer, with all due respect, this isn't the first time that Natasha
has thrown around these kinds of accusation,</a> as was pointed out by Joe Dees.

<p>
I have always tried to treat her with respect, but respect is a two-way
street.  If she plans to persist in this kind of thing, I plan to stand
up to it.

<p>
And I am sorry that everyone on this list had to see that, but I've just
reached my limit on this.  I'm not in competition with anyone, and I don't
appreciate being treated this way.  If Eliezer wants to belittle that, go
ahead, but I did nothing to deserve this.

<p>
