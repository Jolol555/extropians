In the care of LNUX, it opened up about 1000%. I believe this is a record.

I agree completely. The only way to make money on the first day of an IPO 
like this is to wait for a (possible) fall from the early peak. I'm not 
sure this one will fall much, and it's so highly priced already that I 
doubt it's a good longer term investment. It's already higher than RHAT 
(which has been public for over three months).

Okay, Lee, give! How did you do this? And what about YTD return? Did you do 
this with options? Or do you have just one or two superperformers in your 
portfolio. The reason I'm very please with my 103% YTD gain is that I have 
not used options, and there are 20 stocks in the port, so it wasn't a 
matter of getting lucky on one stock.

<p>
Onward to transhuman wealth!
