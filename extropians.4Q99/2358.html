<a name="2386qlink1"><a name="2374qlink1">I suspect I would very much like to comment on the developed thread, but
first I ought to ask what it is about in the opinion</a> of the various contributors.
As I recall, it began this way:
</a>

<p>
"For some years I've been troubled by an apparent decline in the standards of
intellectual rigor in certain precincts of the American academic humanities."

<p>
"The displacement of the idea that facts and evidence matter by the idea that
 everything boils down to subjective interests and perspectives is -- second only
 to American political campaigns -- the most prominent and pernicious
 manifestation of anti-intellectualism in our time."

Ultimately, the questions I'm talking about are value questions: As the
Greeks formulated the ultimate question, "What is the good?"  I don't know
what you mean when you say that "the singular issue of moralism . . . avoids
the hard questions".  What we judge to be good and bad IS the question.

<p>
Ultimately, science and technology will provide us with a complete list of what
we CAN do, but we'll still have to face the question of what we OUGHT to do.

What makes you think there's a difference between these two things?

Can we question that what we DO want is what we SHOULD want?

Of course I have of necessity omitted a great deal of commentary.
But, once again, what are you all talking about?
