to have gone off the deep end to the point where it sits right next
to quartz crystals concentrating "good" cosmic energy.</a>

<a name="1272qlink3">However, it seems there "might" be a possible route through
which high energy magnetic fields could moderate neural
electrical flows.  However this has to be a very "gross"
effect on the brain.</a>  It seems that what you really want
is highly focused neural flow moderators, but I'm pretty
sure Nanomedicine comes out generally on the negative side of
nanobots being able to generate significant magnetic
or electrical fields, so they would have to use another
method to effect local moderating effects.
