<a href="3830.html#3849qlink1">&gt;&gt;A zombie can't Experience anything, though he could refer to "now" just</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by saying it or 'thinking' it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since you have said that we are all zombies, Mr. Fabulich, this would mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you also believe that we do not Experience anything.</i><br>

<a href="3830.html#3849qlink2">&gt;Philosopher A is going on at length about how nothing actually exists.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Philosopher B throws a rock at his head.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Apocryphal, sure.  The point is that ultimately there comes a point where </i><br>
<i>&gt;it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is silly (read: renders no or negative utility) to doubt certain things.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Or</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather, to allow such doubt to hinder either one's decision-making process</i><br>
<i>&gt;or one's logical argumentation.  Do you doubt that the car that is speeding</i><br>
<i>&gt;towards you is actually there?  That's fine,  as long as you step out of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;way of that oncoming "non-existent" car. In the same token, there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;inevitable base assumptions which must be made before any philosophy </i><br>
<i>&gt;becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaningful: first principles, immediate knowledge, etc..  These things </i><br>
<i>&gt;arise</i><br>
<i>&gt;from experience.  Without the experience, there /is/ no basis upon which</i><br>
<i>&gt;other arguments may be built.  It is possible that there is no experience,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as it is possible that nothing exists.  However, in a forum for</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-existential philosophy, either these doubts must be rendered</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaningless, or eveything else.  I chose the doubts, so that I may use my</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences as valid philosophical tools.</i><br>

Here, Hear!  Induction over deduction.  Let's remember that philosophy is 
the queen (bee) of the sciences, thus laying the framework and giving birth 
to the goals of empirical science.<a name="3856qlink1"> Doubting that anything exists creates a 
stasis through paralysis of analysis.</a>  Even if our existence and sensations 
of qualia are an illusion, let's ride the illusion, understand the illusion, 
and socio-scientifically advance the illusion.  The illusion of existence is 
all we have, and it's a damn good one.<a name="3856qlink2">  The skeptic serves his/her purpose 
well if their doubts fertilize a new branch of thought for science to 
pursue, but if the only intention of the skeptic is to just be a pain in the 
ass, then I suggest slitting your jugular vain and smile in your sweet 
victory over the illusion of existence and qualia.</a>

<p>
<a name="3856qlink3">pragmatic theory of truth- a statement or belief is true if and only if "it 
works," if it allows us to predict certain results, if it allows us to 
function effectively in everyday life, and if it encourages further inquiry 
or helps us lead better lives.</a>
