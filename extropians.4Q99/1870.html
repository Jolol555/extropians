Well, I wouldn't call myself a fan, but since I often work at my
computer with the television on during the late night hours, I have
assimilated maybe too many reruns of the series. While I found the
basic story weak and often corny, it raised interesting issues about
personal value systems, codes of honor and ways of acting. As a
television series, it was unusually aware of some real eastern
thinking, even if it often took the easy way out anyway.

<p>
I think we can learn useful stuff even from late night re-runs. Just
modelling some of the characters can be an useful exercise or tool.
