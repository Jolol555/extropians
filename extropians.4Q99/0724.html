Read this as - without treatment it is likely the patient would have
died.  Certainly their quality of life would have been very poor.

Read this as - "accidents happen".

Read this as - we are going to delay this and see if we have a situation
like we had a few years ago with the protein supplements (where the
manufacturing process got contaminated and poisoned a few people).

<p>
Manufacturing gene therapy vectors is not an easy process due to the
fact that you are dealing with highly complex structures and many
steps in the process.  There are things that can go wrong and
ways contaminants can creep into the process (which is not to say
this is what happened with the person cited).

<p>
However, you have a "damned if you do and damned if you don't"
situation.  If you don't use these technologies the patients
*will* end up *dead* (though you could freeze them).  If you
do use the technologies the *might* end up dead sooner or
they just might get better.

<p>
So press forward we must.
