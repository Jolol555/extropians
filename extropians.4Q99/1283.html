Yeah, in a way that means like the building I live in is defying gravity.
It's not.  It's just built for a certain purpose and stands upright.  In the
same way, physical law will not change when computation becomes ubiquitous.
It's just that old notions of limits will no longer apply.

<p>
For example, the laws do not dictate that artificial satellites can't be
made, but in Newton's time such things were [nearly?] impossible.  Thus,
your changing the moon into cheese -- ah, behold the power of cheese!:) --
is not a violation of physical law.  Nanotech or whatever will have to do
certain specific things to bring about such a change, if it is to occur.
(Where to get the wine and crackers from!?!:)
