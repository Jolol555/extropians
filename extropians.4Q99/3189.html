Its still a scramble for funding and maintaining one's career, I bet. So the 
bench scientist stays with what he or she knows and goes for the more likely 
research area to have a payoff; rather then the long-shot.  They might get 
more funding in the area of 'muon-catalyzed fusion' which does have a solid 
model in nature. However, far be it for me to whizz on an new area of 
'over-unity' phenomena. Yet, the funding issue again...eh!
