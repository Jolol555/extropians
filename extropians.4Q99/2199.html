<a name="2220qlink1">Thank you, Geoff, for bringing this to fascinating
site to my attention. Before now, I've never seen a
*good* critique of "Engines of Creation". Now I have.</a> 

<p>
<a name="2220qlink2">Like you, I have reservations about a sentence here
and there, but overall Lyle Burkhead's article
<br>
"Nanotechnology without Genies" is well-reasoned.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2220qlink3">His overall point reminds me of what has happened so
far with nuclear energy and it's original promise of
<br>
"energy too cheap to meter". The promise was based on<br>
the simple physical fact that the energy levels
producable with nuclear reactions are orders of
magnitude greater than with chemical reactions.</a>
<a name="2220qlink4">However, when we actually went about constructing
nuclear energy plants, we found we needed to staff
them with so many well-trained people and include
layer-upon-layer of safeguards (not to mention the
costs of continually assuring the public that it was
safe) that, ultimately, the energy produced costed
more than that produced by coal-burning plants (which
is a shame, since burning coal is so much more dirty,
provided the nuclear plant is a good one that is run
</a>
right.)

<p>
His overall point ALSO reminds me of the so-called
<br>
"productivity paradox" associated with<br>
<br>
computerization, and certain total-cost-of-ownership
arguments about PCs.
