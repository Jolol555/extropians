But the general public considers anybody who knows a few buzzwords, to
be a highly intelligent computer genius.   The new media managed to
label the people with the purple sheets who killed themselves in San
Diego as computer geeks because they had a website!!!

Let's face it, a lot of so called computer geeks aren't good at
anything.  And there are a lot of talented people, who are good at lots
of things (including love making).  But as far as the general public is
concerned we are all computer geeks.
