protein folding problem is to nanomachine design, and how quickly STM
technology is developing, those of us hoping for a seed SI before nanotech
seem to be in a bit of a bind.

<a name="3309qlink1">The chances of developing a seed AI before military nanotech seem
increasingly dismal.  The best hope now would appear to be completion of a
nanotech design for a terrestrial evacuation system before we have actual
assemblers.  This is still an enormously complex project, but it appears
to be simpler than creating a mind.  The problem is that it requires
skills less prevalent than computer programming, requires more expensive
equipment, and is not likely to produce profitable spinoffs in the mean
time.  Perhaps I just don't have enough imagination for the last one.
Ideas would be helpful.</a>
