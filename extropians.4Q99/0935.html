They don't have mine either.  I've heard a few times that until 1980, 
psychiatry didn't acknowledge that children could be clinically depressed.  
<br>
:/  I'm under treatment for depression, obsession, and adjustment disorder, <br>
and on two psychiatric medications currently.  None have been of much help so 
far.  My psychiatrist told me that electroshock is still being done.  I'm 
<a name="0945qlink1"><a name="0940qlink1">interested in an experimental treatment that's "between" drug therapy and 
electroshock.  It's called transcranial magnetic therapy and so far claims to 
be low risk.  Anyone here know about it?
