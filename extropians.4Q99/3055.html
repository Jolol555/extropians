I think that trying to avoid it is taking it seriously.:)  I reflect on how
many people there are I work with, who are very smart when it comes to
planning their finances, dealing with relationships and doing the jobs, but
do nothing to plan to live a lot longer -- other than just paying lip
service to whatever health trend in now in vogue.

<p>
I also would note that Greg Johnson is not considering life extension in his
talk about death.

<p>
I don't think this a "straightforward application of Occam's Razor" so much
as a misapplication of it.  Occam's Razor is meant to apply to human
understanding of reality.  Ergo, the implied question in the phrase
"absolutely necessary" -- "Whom is it is 'absolutely necessary' for?" -- in
the preceding sentence.  That is, it is necessary for human understanding to
function.  However, there is no "straigtforward" answer to whom is it
"absolutely necessary" only to have so many humans and no more or less.

<p>
Also, the assumption above is that being potentially immortal -- note:
potentially; I think actual immortality is unlikley if not impossible; a
long lived being can still be killed somehow, I'm sure -- implies we all
will decide to reproduce and that we will be unable to handle that.
(Uploads, e.g., will be able to repoduce with abandon, given that virtual
beings require so much less resources.  Or so I speculate.)
