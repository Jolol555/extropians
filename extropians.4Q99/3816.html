Perhaps the decision to destroy humanity might be a good judgement call from 
the A.I. perspective!  From the human perspective it would be seen as bad 
judgement!  The A.I. may feel extermination is the best course of action so 
that with humanity out of the way it can develop it's potential without any 
restraining.

<p>
Whether it has been given access or hacked acess to weapons systems such as 
nukes and especially nanotech will determine whether it has a good chance of 
taking humanity out.

<p>
I'm not giving up in a fight like this!  My friends and I will load up our 
hunting rifles and do battle.  I fully expect to get off at least one shot 
before the killer goo shreds me or the nuke goes off overhead!  It's the 
thought that counts. :)

<p>
Imagine a scenario where humanity dukes it out with a reneagade A.I. that 
has gained access to some weapons of mass destruction and does a failed 
"Pearl Harbor" on us only to be destroyed by the retaliation.
Imagine the setback for civilization technologically and culturally if this 
happened.  Social prejudice could make A.I. r&amp;d nearly impossible after that 
which would set back technological progress.  The cybernetic equivalent of 
Dune's "mentat" might be developed to replace the need for A.I. in our 
society.  People on the list have already discussed how uploading could be a 
means of offsetting the power of A.I. among us.
