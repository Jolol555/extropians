Hello,

<p>
I was not sure what to make of David Bowman's websites.  I think he is 
serious but sometimes thought it was a joke of some sort.  I liked some of 
the ideas about academic feudal systems and how scientific establishments 
don't always like new trains of thought.  I found his views on life after 
death interesting.  But when he went on about intelligent reptiles among us 
using mind control tech to pass for human in the British royal family he 
lost me.<a name="2139qlink1">  And what is the deal with the Luciferian Deception, the black sun 
and the year 2012?<a name="2126qlink1">  It looks like a trend may be developing to create odd 
</a>
websites about transhumanism.  What do the rest of you think?</a>


<p>
best regards,

<p>
John Grigg
