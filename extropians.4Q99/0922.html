I can't believe it.  For the past few years since I came up with my 
philosophy of selfism it seems to be I'm not the only one.  How could it

happen that I never noticed the names of Ayn Rand, Stirner, Adams, Anton 
Levay until recently?  Completely uninfluenced by these people I wonder how 
closely I've come to their philosophies. Except for levay, I know his 
philosophies inside and out because the Satanic Bible was the first thing I 
ever read on selfism, who would you recomend for a summory of most of the 
different philosophies and applications of selfism?
