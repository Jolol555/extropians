I'm not entirely sure we should be talking about this, but we have to, don't
we?  My family is German, and they are no more inhuman or less civilized
than any other nationality.  How did such a Bosch nightmare with anal
trumpets, demonic toads, and anatomical grotesques ever happen?

<p>
I know a Latvian woman whose father was killed and she and her mother
abducted as Nazi armored troop carriers blitzed across her front yard,
killing chickens, cattle and demolishing buildings.  Of course she was a
small child, and they were shipped, as you noted, to a munitions factory
in Munich. After some time, her mother began to express an admiration for
Hitler as did many other deportees.  Dagnija couldn't understand this then
or now.  But Hitler in fact was implementing a form of Welfare State at
this time, including something like our W.P.A. during the "Great American
Depression" (which was, of course, worldwide).  Unemployed men became
wage-earners as public projects workers -- everybody, Dagnija tells me,
thought the Autobahn was a sort of engineering miracle.

<p>
At the same time, Hitler's "Corporate State" was busy negotiating with
Volkswagen to provide equipment for the original execution chambers --
shower-stalls with, you guessed it, carbon monoxide from hundreds of
VW exhaust pipes forced through the shower-heads, such a slow way
to die that the condemned rioted frantically in the shower chambers,
screaming and suffocating as they died.  The VW's used are exactly
the "Beetle" that became so popular in this country. Of course, this
procedure attracted unwanted attention, so at Auschwitz and Auschwitz-
 Hitler's chemists experimented with more efficient agents,
eventually formulating Zyklon-B.

<p>
I do not wish to offend anyone, but I haven't the slightest difficulty
imagining Jay Gould, Cornelius Vanderbilt (who used impressed Chinese
labor to build his railways and paid them with liquor), J.P. Morgan,
Charles Schwab, and Andrew Carnegie (who tried to assuage his putative
<a name="3251qlink1">guilt by building public libraries) playing a similar role in the
United States, given the opportunity.</a>

<p>
<a name="3255qlink1">I don't want to believe there are two kinds of people, but then neither
do I wish to regard myself as a psychopathic predator who has learned
to impersonate a civilized being, deceiving myself and others</a> in the
process.
