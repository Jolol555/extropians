<a name="0268qlink1">Last year there was a petty, immature battle going on -- about a topic: 
boring to some, if not all. Today it is called "violence" last year it was 
called "gun control." It is not a new topic on this forum.. It revolves 
around. um ... how can I put this delicately? ... Eh ... some guy with a low 
impulse control ... and ... um... a rampant member of the NRA ... on whether 
or not gun control is a constitutional violation.</a> 

<p>
<a name="0268qlink2">An emotional topic on many different levels. Both of them raised good points. 
However, it got ugly. And the two posters posted *way* too many times a day, 
usually short, profane insults ping-ponged by ego-bashing 'egging ons'. Back 
and Forth it slung...</a>

<p>
<a name="0268qlink3">Instead of the list arbitrator brandishing warnings (that I know about) or 
filtering (by banning) the individuals who perpetuated this emotionally odd 
behavior, or allowing the list members to come down hard on those two 
individuals themselves, Greg Burch and/or Eugene Leitel were called  upon to 
stop it (by banning) -- the topic of guns.

<p>
I left the list, saying I would not be a part of any list that censored. I 
received a post from one key person who seemed concerned about this 
accusation, implying that I was accusing the list of illegal censorship, and 
asking me if I was going to call the police, but that wasn't my point  .. 
nothing wrong with list policies.. free to do what you will with your own 
list... just see ya later alligater...</a>


<p>
<a name="0268qlink4">What I *do* believe is that reasonable discourse about any topic is 
appropriate among people who carry a "limitless" philosophy, for one cannot 
know *where* inspiration comes from and must allow one's self to see all 
things -- &amp;  -- it is behavior (not topics) -- that must be censored. 


<p>
It's stylistic. 

<p>
Dealing with it otherwise is sideways, not to the point, and ineffective. A 
cop out.


<p>
upon my return, i see, that not only was my choice correct, still is, but 
also that it was *indeed* highly ineffective to ban by topic.... The subject 
</a>
line 'guns' has now been changed to 'violence,' but the list behavior 
continues.... sigh... 

<p>
Anyone here ever watch "Get a Life'? ; )
