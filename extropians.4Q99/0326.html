<a name="0332qlink1">How about an agency that creates tests covering all materials and difficulty 
to test students understanding of several areas.  Each school submits all 
subjects being taught (not material) and then the students will be tested on 
those subjects ranging all difficulties of the subjects.  The results would 
then be compiled and compared with other schools.  The schools would credit 
the student (thus verifying the students abilities to employers and the rest 
of society) and the agency would rate the schools.</a>
