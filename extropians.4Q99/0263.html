Check out "Sophie's World", by Jostein Gardner.  'Seductive' accurately
describes this novel.  It almost makes you forget that you're getting an
introduction to the history of western philosophy while you follow the
plot.

I read and discuss philosopy out of a complusion that began at age six,
when it first occured to me that I had no way of really knowing what
happens to the world when I close my eyes.  Does it all just disappear
when I'm not looking?  Is everyone around me and all the scenery just an
elaborate show put on for my benefit? and *How do I know?*  

<p>
I got older and broadened my focus to include other questions, but I
think it starts out that way for a lot of people.
