<a href="0649.html#0686qlink1">    &gt;The way to keep schools competitive is just to let them</a><br>
<i>    &gt;compete; nothing more, nothing less.  Just piling more and</i><br>
<i>    &gt; more tests and mandates and controls and other top-down</i><br>
<i>    &gt; imposed-order crap will just compound the bureaucracy.</i><br>

<p>
You seem to think I disagree with this, I don't.  I was saying
how I'd run a school if I was in charge, run your school
anyway you like. I think my school would do better than yours
but we'd soon know if I'm wrong and if so I'll try things your way.
I have no ideology in this I just want what works. The key is to
let the schools be part of the free market, then maybe even a
slum would have as many good schools as good cars.

<p>
<a href="0649.html#0686qlink2">    &gt;If  you give bureaucrats power to make the sstate-imposed system</a><br>
<i>    &gt; better, they'll use that power for their own purposes, not</i><br>
<i>    &gt; those intended.</i><br>

<p>
Obviously the first step in reforming education would be to dump
all state schools and go private.
