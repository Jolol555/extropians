By the time this planet has a population of 50 billion well cared-for people 
the average intelligence and educational level through technological 
intervention will be such that for every one extraordinary person you know 
now...  there will be thousands then!!  The very specialness of the very 
intelligent and curious individuals might on this list could be lost in a 
future world where so many have the same traits.  I think we live in a 
special period of time where we can truly appreciate people like them.

<p>
I understand your point of the exciting nature of a world filled with people 
you only can meet in large numbers at an Extro!<a name="3201qlink1">  This future world will be a

great place to live but it will mean even more to us having lived through 
these times.  We will be in a position like no others to appreciate the 
wonders of the future.


<p>
sincerely,
