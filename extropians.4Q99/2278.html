<a name="2438qlink1">I thought this essay by Greg Johnson might be helpful in this thread.</a>  At
least, it might clear up some issues before ditching the self concept.

<p>
For the record, I think the self concept works well and is based on reality.
The human mind acts as a unity -- in as much as anything that we normally
think of as a unity acts thus.  I think improvements on it probably will
too, but that remains to be seen.

Cheers!

Subject: OWL: Beyond Altruism and Egoism


<p>
<i>&gt; I wrote this little essay about 7 years ago to clarify my thinking. I</i><br>
offer
<br>
<i>&gt; it here because I think it is apropos of current discussions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The Priority of the Good: Beyond Altruism and Egoism"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One of Ayn Rand's genuine achievements as a moral philosopher</i><br>
<i>&gt; --and one of the chief sources of her fame and notoriety--is her critique</i><br>
<i>&gt; of altruism. But many Objectivists do not clearly understand her argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; and its implications. I shall, therefore, restate Rand's critique of</i><br>
<i>&gt; altruism.  Furthermore, I shall draw out a surprising implication: that</i><br>
her
<br>
<i>&gt; critique applies as much to egoism as it does to altruism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rand's most concise argument against altruism is in the Introduction to</i><br>
<i>&gt; THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS. Rand assumes, uncontroversially, that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose of an ethical theory is to answer the question, "What is the</i><br>
Good?"
<br>
<i>&gt; She also assumes a very specific conception of altruism. For Rand, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; altruist answer to the question of the Good is: "The Good is what is good</i><br>
<i>&gt; for others, and the bad is what is good for oneself." Service to others is</i><br>
<i>&gt; good; service to the self is bad. The best way, then, to do good and avoid</i><br>
<i>&gt; evil is to serve others in a way that does not serve oneself, i.e., to</i><br>
<i>&gt; practice self-sacrifice. Rand's argument does not, therefore, apply to</i><br>
such
<br>
<i>&gt; ordinary senses of "altruism" as kindness, benevolence, and respect for</i><br>
<i>&gt; others.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rand argues that altruism is not a viable theory of the Good, because to</i><br>
<i>&gt; identify the Good with what is good for others does not tell us what the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Good is. It simply tells us who should benefit from the Good. We are,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, still left wondering, "Yes, but what is the Good for others?"</i><br>
And:
<br>
<i>&gt; "What is the Good for oneself?" By defining the Good as the good for</i><br>
<i>&gt; others, altruism amounts to an empty, circular definition of the Good.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rand's diagnosis of the source of this circularity is quite insightful:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are two moral questions which altruism lumps together . . . : (1)</i><br>
<i>&gt; What are values? (2) Who should be the beneficiary of values?  Altruism</i><br>
<i>&gt; substitutes the second for the first; it evades the task of defining a</i><br>
code
<br>
<i>&gt; of moral values, thus leaving man . . . without moral guidance." (VOS,</i><br>
<i>&gt; paperback ed., p. viii.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rand points out that the altruists have simply confused the question "What</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the Good?" with the question "Who should benefit from the Good?" The</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions, however, are distinct. Furthermore, the first question must be</i><br>
<i>&gt; answered before the second one. One must know what the Good is before one</i><br>
<i>&gt; can say who should benefit from it. The question of the Good has priority.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Altruism is a circular account of the Good because it answers the second</i><br>
<i>&gt; question, but ignores the first. Altruism thus defaults on the primary</i><br>
<i>&gt; question of ethics. Furthermore, because altruism is not a definition of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Good, the altruist must, by default, simply accept uncritically</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever people think is good at any given time. Altruism then tells us:</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfy the desires of others; deny your own. It cannot tell us which</i><br>
<i>&gt; desires are good or bad, noble or ignoble.  Altruism, then, is not a moral</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory so much as a failure to have a moral theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; At this point, a common error of Rand's readers is to conclude that, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; altruism fails as an account of the Good, then egoism must be the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; account. After all, Rand entitles her book THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS: A</i><br>
NEW
<br>
<i>&gt; CONCEPT OF EGOISM and is an advocate of self-interest and laissez-faire</i><br>
<i>&gt; capitalism, isn't she? Egoism, these readers think, means making all moral</i><br>
<i>&gt; decisions by calculating which options best serve one's interests. One</i><br>
<i>&gt; chooses friends, lovers, careers, lifestyles, hobbies, entertainment, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; habits by the standard of self-interest. When faced with any option, one</i><br>
<i>&gt; asks, "What's in it for me?"  The Good is what is good for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This, however, is a mistake. To make all moral decisions by the standard</i><br>
<i>&gt; of self-interest is, implicitly, to define the Good as what is good for</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's self. But this account of the Good suffers from the same problems as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the altruist account. Therefore, it is just as much subject to Rand's</i><br>
<i>&gt; critique as altruism. Egoism does not really answer the question, "What is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Good?" It simply pushes it back. Now we have to ask, "Yes, but what is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Good for me?"  Egoism, just as much as altruism, denies the priority</i><br>
of
<br>
<i>&gt; the question "What is the Good?" and substitutes the question "Who should</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit from the [undefined] Good?" Because it does not define the Good,</i><br>
<i>&gt; conventional egoism, like altruism, leads us to accept uncritically</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever preferences people happen to have at a given time. It then tells</i><br>
<i>&gt; us to satisfy our own preferences first. Because it fails to define the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Good, it cannot, however, tell us which desires are good and which are</i><br>
bad.
<br>
<i>&gt; Egoism too, then, is not so much a moral theory as a default on moral</i><br>
theory.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Although Rand is widely known as an egoist, her actual position lies</i><br>
<i>&gt; beyond altruism and egoism. Rand uncovers the common root of both altruism</i><br>
<i>&gt; and egoism: the replacement of the question of the Good with the question</i><br>
<i>&gt; of beneficiaries. By affirming the priority of the Good over</i><br>
beneficiaries,
<br>
<i>&gt; Rand rejects both altruism and egoism at the root. Rand is just as little</i><br>
<i>&gt; an egoist as she is an altruist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now, I do not wish to deny that Rand is an egoist in some sense.  Clearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; she is. After having answered the question of the Good--the Good for man</i><br>
is
<br>
<i>&gt; man's life qua man, i.e., human flourishing--Rand turns to the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt; beneficiaries and argues that the individual should be the chief</i><br>
<i>&gt; beneficiary of his own actions. But there is a reason that she subtitles</i><br>
<i>&gt; VOS "A New Concept of Egoism." Rand's egoism is new and different because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it affirms the priority of the question of the Good over the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt; beneficiaries. Rand's egoism is a derivative principle, not a primary.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This means that, although the individual should be the chief beneficiary</i><br>
<i>&gt; of his own actions, the standard by which he determines which actions are</i><br>
<i>&gt; good or bad cannot be self-interest. Rather, the standard must be the</i><br>
Good.
<br>
<i>&gt; The standard cannot be self-interest, because the self and its interests</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot be treated as moral primaries which must be accepted uncritically</i><br>
<i>&gt; and treated as the standard of what is good. This would default on the</i><br>
more
<br>
<i>&gt; fundamental moral question: "Which desires and preferences are good?"</i><br>
This
<br>
<i>&gt; question cannot be reduced to the question of self-interest, for it raises</i><br>
<i>&gt; the question of whether one's self and one's interests are worthy of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfied in the first place. Some selves and some interests are simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; corrupt and should not be served.  They cannot, however, be judged corrupt</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the standard of self-interest. They can be judged corrupt only by</i><br>
<i>&gt; another, higher standard: the Good.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ethics, for Rand, is not a set of rules for pursuing self-interest</i><br>
<i>&gt; regardless of the self or the interests involved. Rather, ethics for Rand</i><br>
<i>&gt; is about what kind of selves and what kinds of interests are good.</i><br>
Although
<br>
<i>&gt; Rand seldom used the word and never discussed the concept, the central</i><br>
<i>&gt; concern of the Objectivist ethics is character.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is important to appreciate the priority of the Good in Rand's thought,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for many Objectivists--including Rand herself--are prone to adopting</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-interest as the standard of what is good, especially when applying</i><br>
<i>&gt; moral principles to particular situations. David Kelley, for instance, has</i><br>
<i>&gt; recently claimed that the fact that respecting individual rights is good</i><br>
<i>&gt; for man qua man is not sufficient reason to respect people's rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kelley writes that:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even if I understand that your freedom is good for you . . . I don't yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a reason for regarding your freedom as a good for me.  But this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; precisely the point that must be established if we are going to validate</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights on the basis of ethical egoism. ("Post-Randian Aristotelianism,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; LIBERTY)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      The root of Kelley's error is the claim that Objectivism validates</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights "on the basis of ethical egoism." This, I have proven, is false.</i><br>
For
<br>
<i>&gt; Rand, nothing is validated by the standard of self-interest. Rather, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; self and its interests are validated by the standard of the Good.</i><br>
Violating
<br>
<i>&gt; people's rights has been in the interests of many selves throughout</i><br>
<i>&gt; mankind's long, bloody history. But, by the standard of the Good, these</i><br>
<i>&gt; selves are corrupt and their interests should not be satisfied. It is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore, completely unecessary to demand a reason to respect the rights</i><br>
<i>&gt; of others over and above the fact that it is good, i.e., that it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; requirement of man's life qua man.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What is the source of the tendency for Objectivists to substitute</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-interest for the Good as the standard of value?  Here is one</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypothesis.  Although Rand rejects conventional egoism, she still employs</i><br>
<i>&gt; its rhetoric.  The clearest example of this is the title "The Virtue of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Selfishness."  If, however, one checks Rand's list of the virtues in "The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Objectivist Ethics" selfishness does not actually appear there!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But there is a danger to this rhetoric. Although language could not exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; without human beings, it is not simply a human invention or tool; rather,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is an evolved, objective social phenomenon. The meanings of words were</i><br>
<i>&gt; not, therefore, simply invented by fiat. Nor can they be redefined by</i><br>
fiat.
<br>
<i>&gt;   Words come with ingrained connotations which are objective facts. And,</i><br>
<i>&gt; just as it is difficult to work wood against the grain, it is difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use words in ways that contradict their settled connotations. Words, to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; commanded, must be obeyed. Thus, although Rand is careful to speak of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "new" egoism, the inbuilt connotations of the word "egoism" pull thought</i><br>
in
<br>
<i>&gt; a different direction, toward conventional egoism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; How can one avoid this tendency? The first step is simply to become aware</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the problem. Monitor oneself. Whenever one finds oneself asking,</i><br>
"What's
<br>
<i>&gt; in it for me?" immediately counter by asking, "What's so good about me?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not a counsel of humility, but of pride, i.e., moral ambition. We</i><br>
<i>&gt; can only improve ourselves morally by judging ourselves morally. And the</i><br>
<i>&gt; greatest obstacle to self-improvement is that all too common Objectivist</i><br>
<i>&gt; vice: smug and excessive self-esteem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Self-monitoring is important. But the only guaranteed way of avoiding</i><br>
<i>&gt; conventional egoism is to drop the rhetoric of egoism altogether. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; essence and standard of the Objectivist ethics is human flourishing, man's</i><br>
<i>&gt; life qua man, the Good. Self-interest is neither the essence nor the</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard of the Objectivist ethics. It follows, therefore, that one can</i><br>
<i>&gt; communicate the essence of the Objectivist ethics without ever using the</i><br>
<i>&gt; word "egoism."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So why not do it?  Leonard Peikoff has given one plausible objection.  He</i><br>
<i>&gt; claims that if one were to set out Objectivism without mentioning</i><br>
<i>&gt; selfishness, the first objection would be, "But you're just advocating</i><br>
<i>&gt; selfishness!"  Since it is inevitable that selfishness will come up,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Peikoff argues that we might as well be open about it from the beginning.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree. The rhetoric of egoism just muddies the waters. If one's</i><br>
<i>&gt; interlocutor muddies the waters by bringing up the issue, then the proper</i><br>
<i>&gt; response is not to pre-emptively muddy the waters, but to clear them up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; One clears them up by offering the very arguments that I have offered</i><br>
<i>&gt; above. One must show that identifying the Good with what is good for self</i><br>
<i>&gt; or others simply defaults on the question of ethics. One must argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the issue of beneficiaries is a secondary issue that is logically</i><br>
dependent
<br>
<i>&gt; upon a prior answer to the question of the Good. One must then challenge</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's interlocutor to turn from the shadowy but seductive pseudo-ethics of</i><br>
<i>&gt; altruism and egoism toward the shining sovereignty of the Good.</i><br>
