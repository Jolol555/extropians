<p>
hello.

<p>
	the following are some of my interpretations of the _technological
singularity_. please forgive my many necessarily vague dictions.

<p>
<a name="1573qlink1">	first of all, some seem to believe that current technological
growth trends fit a hyperbolic curve and will therefore reach a true
mathematical singularity some time in the near future. however, my
calculus reference calls the hyperbolic functions "a class of exponential
functions," and a cursory examination seems to indicate that hyperbolic
functions do not grow to infinity in finite time. what gives?</a>

<p>
<a name="1573qlink2">	in fact, a very brief review of the most elementary functions
gives one the impression that almost all functions that reach a
singularity involve division of two distinct forces or what is essentially
the same, a logarithm. examples include rational funtions 
(f(x) = -1 / (x - 5)), logarithmic functions (f(x) = -ln(5-x)), and
trignometric functions (f(x) = tan(x)). 

<p>
	thus a speculative leap: at least two interacting forces are
necessary to reach a true mathematical singularity, and no single force
can "grow" to infinity in finite time. that is, faster-than-exponential
growth (x!, e^(x^x), etc.) does not imply singularity per se.</a>

<p>
<a name="1573qlink3">	the above leads me back to vinge's interpretation of the
_technological singularity_: that the singularity is a dialectic between
accelerating growth of technology on the one hand and static human nature
on the other. what the singularity delineates is the ever-shrinking gap
between the rate of change that a human being can accomodate and the
amount of change that transpires in unit time. it decribes a progression
of rapidly shrinking "prediction horizons" at the end of which is a
darkness in which the human being is essentially blind -- unable to guess
what is to come in the very next moment.</a>

<p>
<a name="1573qlink4">	however, in order for the preceding to be true, the force behind
technological growth must be independent of the human being (or else it
will most likely level off as a bacterial population exhausting its
nutrient supply). that is, to obtain two truly interacting forces, the
human being must create her nemesis, the self-modifying intelligence.</a>

<p>
<a name="1573qlink5">	all of the above suggests that the _technological singularity_ is
in some sense a trick of perpective -- technology never really grows
infinitely fast, but we won't be able to tell the difference if we grow
too slowly or not at all.</a>

<p>
<a name="1573qlink6">	ergo, the implications can be summarized as follows: with AI, the
singularity is possible; with IA, the singularity is avoidable; and with
both, the singularity is uncertain. if this is true, then the race between
AI and IA may be the driving conflict on the road to the singularity.
