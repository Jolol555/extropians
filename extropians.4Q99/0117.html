<a href="0059.html#0117qlink1">&gt; I think we need a quick seminar from Anders on the possible differences</a><br>

<p>
Glad to be of help :-) 

<p>
LTP = Long Term Potentiation occurs when two connected neurons (call
them A and B) are active together, especially if the presynaptic
neuron A is activated at a high frequency for a while. The signals
caused on the B side of the synapse by neuron A will become stronger
after this treatment, it has been "potentiated". LTD = Long Term
Depression occurs when the presynaptic neuron is activated at a low
frequency; this weakens the signal, and we say the synapse has been
depressed.

<p>
Neuroscientists love the LTP/LTD pair, since they seems to be a
reasonable basis for memory implementing Hebb's rule ("neurons that
fire together wire together"). LTP makes correlated neurons connect
together, while LTD makes anti-correlated neurons decrease their
connections. With just LTP, the network would likely work less well
because synapses would be "filled up" and cannot easily be re-used,
while LTD enables erasure as things change. In fact, some studies
suggest that LTD is more important than LTP for certain tasks; I'm not
sure about that one yet.
