Dear Transhumanists:

<hr>
<br>
I herewith take the liberty to announce the recent start of a new mailing 
list called

<pre>
                ``The Artificial Intelligence Research Club''

</pre>
<p>
This mailing list will discuss how to practically construct an AI that should 
become self-aware.  

<hr>
<br>
The purpose of the mailing list is to serve as a sounding board, and as a 
medium to exchange technical information and through which possibly to 
construct individual cooperations, to people who are themselves engaged in     
constructing (parts of) a self-aware AI. 

<p>
Anyone already working on constructing (parts of) a self-aware AI is hereby 
*warmly* invited to join the mailing list. 

<p>
The mailing list will, it is hoped, contribute to each subscriber's own, 
individual, activities in the field of AI.  It is intended as the 
information-exchange portion of a kind of ''research group'', but there is no 
formal ''research institution'' behind it claiming ownership of any idea 
posted on the mailing list. 

<hr>
<br>
The mailing list is not intended to discuss the morality or any political 
issues related to a possible self-aware AI.  People who think that it is 
morally 'bad' that people should think about constructing a self-aware AI, are 
urged *not* to subscribe to the mailing list. 

<hr>
<br>
To subscribe to the mailing list, 


<UL>
  <li>  Send a blank email to intelligence-subscribe@topica.com;
   -or-  Visit <a href="http://www.topica.com">http://www.topica.com</a> and look up the ''Artificial Intelligence 
         Research Club'' mailing list there;
   -or-  Contact any of the people already on the list or any of the list 
         owners, 
              Clint O'Dell (clintodell@visto.com) or 
              Menno Rubingh (rubingh@delftnet.nl), 
         personally via email.

<hr>

</UL>
<br>
For more information on the ``The AI Research Club'', or on where to find 
information about it on the Web, contact Clint or me by email.  Please feel 
free to inform anyone who might be interested in cooperating in the ``The AI 
Research Club'' discussion group of the existence of the mailing list. 

<hr>
