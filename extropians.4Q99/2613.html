A most excellent compromise; and the substitution of "puzzle" for "a truth"
is consistent with my own quirky and largely unintelligible epistemology. I
think your use of an integer is treading on thin ice, however.

Why is it, after all this time, Occidentals are still Admiral George Dewey
steaming into Manilla Bay flying an enormous, tasteless flag announcing
"The Doctrine of Manifest Destiny"?  The Oriental notion of "T'ai-chi" is
a metaphor -- rather like the String or Quantum microcosm:

<pre>
                            The Way itself is like some thing
                            Seen in a dream, elusive, evading one.
                            In it are images, elusive, evading one.
                            In it are things like shadows in twilight.
                            In it are essences, subtle but real,
                            Embedded in truth.

</pre>

Metaphors, like analogies in general, perform communications functions
of which literal descriptive prose or abstract symbolic notation are
incapable.  Orientals are masters at the use of ambiguities to evoke
complex meanings (c.f. Haiku).  This I think, Damien, is the right word--
"ambiguous", not "wishy-washy", in the same sense that "turbulence"
is ambiguous with respect to predictability, but not wishy-washy, or
the specification of the location of an electron if we measure its
momentum is not "wishy-washy", simply ambiguous.
