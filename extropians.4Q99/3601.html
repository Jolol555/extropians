A joke, yeah?

<p>
There's an essay on this 
<br>
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jul/zero.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jul/zero.htm</a>

<p>
<a name="3644qlink1"><a name="3603qlink1">AFAIK (and according to specialists) the first century
DID have 100 years, from 1 A.D. to 100 A.D.. The 2nd
century went from 201 to 300, etc.</a></a>

<p>
 Denis Exiguus (St Denis) , who invented the Julian
Calendar, was working before the introduction of the
digit "0" (from Arabic mathematics). He would be using
Roman numerals, "I" to "C", etc. He simply jumped from
1 BC to 1 AD. Jesus was born in 1 AD according to this
setup. 

<p>
 So the the 3rd millenium begins at 1 + 2000, ie 2001
AD.

<p>
 To get around this, you have to define "millenium"
purely on the actual number (not years since Jesus' 
(conventionally dated) birth).

<p>
  This is inconsistent with the way millennia</a> and
centuries have been counted. It's winning in
popularity, however.

<p>
So maybe It's not the Millenium, it's just a very
"noughty" year :). (Apologies to Python fans).
But anyway, it'll be 2000, yippee!

<p>
On madness,

<p>
 It seems that many people are choosing to avoid the
crowds. In Sydney the railways are having a 2 hr
hiatus cnetred on midnight to check for Y2K
difficulties; this seems to have persuaded many to
stay at home. Apparently they cannot simulate NYE on
their systems ahead of time.


<p>
Have a great NYE 2000!!. Avoid crazies. Check the
computer.

<p>
