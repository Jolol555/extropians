Dear Patrick Wilken, &amp; other Extropians,

<p>
<a href="1979.html#2091qlink1">&gt; I like Dennett too, but I am not sure I am sold on the ideas of memes.</a><br>

<i>&gt; would resolve any of the binding problems?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1979.html#2091qlink2">&gt; I am sort of curious: people talk about memes as this really groovy</a><br>

<i>&gt; understanding thoughts, emotions, or consciousness, than those developed in</i><br>
<i>&gt; cognitive neuroscience (which lack any mention of memes).</i><br>

<p>
Okay, that's an excellent critical reply.  I feel I should be able to explain
what these memetics people are so 'groovy' about.

<p>
(Sorry if the reply below is too long, too much brainstormed, and contains
some redundant repetitions.)

Conceding immediately that I am not a specialist in psychology or in any of 
the psychological cognitive sciences (I'm just a programmer with an interest 
in machine learning), I do think that memetics gives a clearer, that is, more 
objective/materialistic/reductionistic, view on many issues studied in 
psychology and the cognitive sciences, relying less on hard-to-define concepts 
like 'consciousness', 'feeling', 'emotions' etc. 

Memetics just observes that humans copy around among themselves, and sometimes 
mutate, bits of information (fashions, behaviour patterns, theories, etc.); 
arbitrarily calls a 'unit' of such copied-around information a 'meme'; and 
then observes that this copying-around and mutating process which memes are 
undergoing is just exactly the process of EVOLUTION.   That's all that's 
needed as basics in memetics.  I think these basics are very observable and 
hard to dispute. 


<br>
<a href="1979.html#2091qlink3">&gt; How is 'memetics' a more powerful tool for</a><br>
<i>&gt; understanding thoughts, ...</i><br>

I think that thoughts *are* memes.  The set of things qualifying as 'thoughts' 
comprise e.g.: theories about how the world functions, moral ideas and beliefs 
about how a person should behave in certain circumstances, etc.  Anything 
capable of being expressed (verbally) as a 'thought' is capable of being 
copied around between humans as a 'meme'; therefore, thoughts equal memes.  
A human is a thought-processor, i.e., a meme-processor.  

The process by which the brain processes memes does not have to be 'conscious' 
at the bottom level; it can (probably is) hard-wired in at that level.  

Built on top of that level you can have 'conscious' thoughts, i.e. you can 
consciously process and reflect on memes.  I think that the kind of conscious 
meme-processing (reasoning) we rationalists do really is the execution of 
'semi-unconscious' reasoning hehaviour which we rationalists have 
(semi-unconsciosly) absorbed and copied from sources in our surroundings.  
(The meme for cold rational reasoning, the meme for suppressing base emotions, 
the meme for disrespect of sloppy emotionality, the meme for loving 
self-control and being in charge of yourself, the meme for believing in 
individuality and personal freedom, ...) 

How 'thinking' can 'feel' conscious can be explained, I think, by the 
observation that associations between 'feelings/emotions' and memes is 
probably also *learned*.  That is, when picking up a meme (say, the meme for 
honesty) you also pick up the things that associate the recipe for honesty 
that can be expressed in words ('you should be honest') with all kinds of 
emotions: e.g. associating being yourself not honest with the feeling of fear 
(of becoming punished or unmasked by others), of pride (of persisting in your 
honesty despite difficulties), or hope (of future rewards for your honesty), 
etc.  Maybe this is an aspect of what the brain does when processing memes: 
managing and storing these connections between memes expressed through 
language and the 'feelings' which are also 'used' instinctively.  Thus 
explaining how 'memes' could have a (learned) emotional aspect and how 
'thoughts' and the process of 'thinking' can feel conscous to the person who 
does the thinking. 

<br>
&gt; ... emotions, ...<br>

Emotions are, by definition, instinctive things which are genetically 
hard-wired into a human.  There is nothing emotional per se about memes; 
however, I think that memes are definitely associated by any human individual 
with a *lot* of emotions (see above).  So that's where in my opinion memetics 
does fit into the picture in the 'integration' of consciousness. 

<br>
&gt; ... or consciousness,<br>

'Consciousness' is a *very* hard-to-define concept.  What *is* 
'consciousness' ?  I think that maybe there are a lot of different concepts 
which have become sloppily aggregated under the common name of consciousness, 
and that the term 'consciousness' is rather unwieldy entanglement of concepts. 
Everyone seems to have his own definition of consciousness.  

Cognitive psychologists seem to view consciousness basically as a 'feeling' 
thing.  If you can feel a thing (like pain), then you are conscious of it, 
they say.  But that leaves open the question: what *is* ''feeling'' really ?  
Why does feeling gives a persion the idea that he is ''consciously'' feeling a 
thing ?  Memetics per se has little to do with this view of consciousness. 

If you see consciousness as a person's outook on life, as his world-view, then 
that means you say that consciousness equals the culture of a group of people. 
But culture equals the memes stored in that group of people.  

I think that there are many different kinds, ''tastes'', of consciousness.  A 
child of 3 years old, a rationalist of 40, a deeply religious orthodox 
believing in heaven and hell, all have (I think) a diffent 'consciousness': 
they not only 'think' differently, but they also have different emotions 
associated with the events occuring around them to which they respond -- that 
is, they also 'feel' differently. 

I have this suspicion that when you make a thing (machine) that exhibits
behaviour that is in any way 'intelligent', i.e. behaviour that seems to be 
aimed at actively enhancing the thing's survival, then that thing will 
automatically be 'conscious'.  Is a bacterium conscious when it has this 
behaviour of actively grabbing food particles it bumps into ?  Does the 
bacterium have any 'feelings' when it grabs the food particle ?  If you define 
'feeling' as "an instinctive and automatic bodily reaction, working probably 
chemically, triggered by events in its environment, inducing the organism to 
be disposed more to certain kinds of action and less to other kinds of 
action", then I think the only honest conclusion is that the bacterium DOES 
feel; and also, therefore, that it does have (a kind of) consciousness.  

I think consciousness comes automatically, inevitably, in any organism or 
machine that exhibits behaviour aimed at its own proliferation.  In a 'higher' 
organism (like humans), this automatically gets you the kind of complex 
'consciousness' that we humans 'feel' in ourselves.  I think any organism is 
automatically 'conscious' about anything in its environment that is of 
importance to its survival/proliferation and to which it is capable of 
reacting (either by hard-wiring and/or by programmed/learned behaviour). 

In a species that does many things with memes, like us humans, memes are a 
part of that individual's environment with which he interacts; therefore, how 
he interacts with memes determines a large part of his consciousness.  Note 
that behaviour patterns that are never or seldom expressed verbally (e.g. 
clothes fashions, the behaviour pattern of answering when someone asks you a 
question) are also copied around between humans, and therefore are also memes. 

I think the main way memetics can help in understanding 'thinking', 
'consciousness', etc. is to brush off a lot of traditional, emotional, 
irrational stuff in our thinking about these things.  Lower animals are just 
dumb machines reacting entirely intuitively to their environment; humans are 
the same machines, but equipped with an organ (the brain) which executes a 
dumb machine-like process which copies, stories, and sometimes (randomly) 
mutates memes and connects memes with lower machine-states (the intuitive 
'feelings').  Thinking and the generation of new ideas is just the 
evolutionary process with memes as replicators.  Evolutionary means 
mechanical, without inherent intelligence, and 'driven' by dumb 'random'.  
That's all.  Everything mechanical, and and the basic operation of it does not 
need the concepts of 'emotion' or 'consciousness'.  Instead, I think that 
exacly *because* it does not rely on the concepts of 'feeling', 
'consciousness' etc., this mechanical explanation of things can help *explain* 
what 'feeling' and 'consciousness' really are.  With this mechanical point of 
view, you kind of look at these things from the other side, from the outside 
(as any scientist should try to do), instead of from the inside as an organism 
that is itself trapped in its own 'feeling' and its own experience of its 
consciousness and using its own feelings of consciousness as basis of its 
reasoning.  

It is, I think, precisely this 'looking-from-the-outside' viewpoint that
makes these memeticists so 'groovy' about memetics.
