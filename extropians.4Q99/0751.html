Gish is pretty much a kook. However, he's a very popular kook. He talks in
snappy little sound bites, and is a past master at manipulating
creationist media. If a listener has no knowledge of science or formal
logic (sadly, the normal condition in North America), it is very easy to
be taken in by him.

<p>
Especially if his half-arguments and snappy little sound bites re-confirm
"truths" you've known your whole life.

<p>
See www.infidels.org for a vast library of information, including several
debates involving Gish, and an extensive, point by point rebuttal to
Gish's seminal work "Evidence that Demands a Verdict", titled "The Jury is
In". Well worth reading.
