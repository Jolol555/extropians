Of course, our entire universe might (as Hans Moravec demonstrates)
be a bloody huge simulation running inside a "resurrection machine"
designed to resurrect all _possible_ pre-singularity sapient organisms by
emulating them. (This assumes that his idea of replicating nanomachines
effectively causing a "phase change" in the nature of the universe,
expanding outwards at close to lightspeed and converting dead, dumb
matter into organised processing power is valid.)

<p>
How could we test it? Simple: build a galactic supercluster full
of Matrioshka brains and try to run a buffer-overflow attack on the
computational ultrasctructure of spacetime. I mean, assuming whatever's
down below the Planck length is computational in nature, and assuming
it's designed to save state information (that is, it's a resurrection
machine), about 10^18 MB's thinking hard at the same time might _just_ be
able to drain a large proportion of the entire universe's computational
bandwidth.<a name="3359qlink1">  Overload it enough and some interesting transient glitches
(local variations in the speed of light, curvature of spacetime, or
ratio of some fundamental forces?) might show up.

<p>
Of course, running a denial-of-service attack on the universe
might not be such a good idea ..
