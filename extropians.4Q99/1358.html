<p>
You're being very sloppy with your language and your thinking here.
PROOF, as in absolute inviolable certainty, is irrelevant to reality.
I can't PROVE the laws of probability, but that doesn't mean I have
to have faith in them to make use of them.  There _is_ a useful middle
ground--committment.  I have committed thousands of dollars over the
years to my mastery of the laws of probability, and given</a> the

Your million-coin-flip bet is a cop out; you know it isn't physically
possible to test your theory within your lifetime, so you're safe.  If
you had any balls, you'd offer a bet that's feasible.  I offer this
one to any takers: flip an unmodified US dime 10 times.  If it lands
head-up all 10 times, I'll give you $100, otherwise I'll keep the dime.

<p>
This in no way means I have unlimited unshakable faith in the laws
of probability.  It just means I'm willing to bet $100 on them
(because I know that on average, I make 0.24 cents every time I take
this bet).</a></a>
