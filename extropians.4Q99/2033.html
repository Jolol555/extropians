<a name="2046qlink1"><a href="2031.html#2033qlink2">&gt; I've been thinking about this question off and on for years, and the</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2035qlink4">How clever does the software have to be?  I mean, what exactly are you
envisioning it doing?  (I'm assuming that we're using design-ahead to
build nanocomputers that run Linux so that the software can be tested,
in miniature, on existing computers.)</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2046qlink2"><a name="2035qlink5">What kind of "design-ahead"?  And how much do you need to know about the
exact nature of the assembler breakthrough beforehand?</a>  Suppose the
<a name="2035qlink6">drextech is soft instead of hard?</a>  How does the complexity required to
build a hard-nano spaceship<a name="2035qlink7"> in a vat compare to building soft-nano grey
</a>
goo that reproduces in the wild?

<p>
<a name="2046qlink3"><a name="2035qlink8">How much power do you need for making fuel?  Can the fuel be
manufactured in advance?  If not, is there some way you can use
nanotechnology to get around the problem by concentrating existing
resources, at least on a once-off basis?  How about fusion drives?</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2046qlink4"><a href="2031.html#2033qlink3">&gt; Bottom line:  Give me the right tools and I could be out of here tomorrow.</a><br>
