Thanks for the plug Hal.  My only disagreement is that I find such
curve fitting much more informative that speculations about nanotech
and AI, and least for the near term.  If we have seen roughly four
exponential growth modes so far, it is presumptuous to project
dozens of more modes going faster and faster.  But it is probably safe
to project one or maybe two such modes.  This prediction has plenty
dramatic enough consequences if only the world would take it seriously.
