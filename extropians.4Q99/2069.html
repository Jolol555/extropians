ArtSci99 is being SPONSORED BY 12 Point Rule, Ltd., LEONARDO JOURNAL (MIT),
ARTBYTE Magazine, and PROXIMA /Theatrical Supplies &amp; Services, and is a
co-production of Art &amp; Science Collaborations, Inc.(ASCI) 718 816-9796 and
the Extended Studies Program of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of
Science and Art. 212 353-4195 

<p>
(If anyone would like to meet me in Manhattan for this Conference, I will
be facilitating the Breakout Session #2 after Panel #2:  "Techno-artists,
humanistic scientists, and artists-engineers abound. Pre-millennial
bandwagon or true Renaissance? This panel will seek to examine what is
different about today from any other period (e.g. 1960s) of strong,
art-science relationships and define some of the factors behind this most
recent convergence.")

<p>
For Information on the Conference:

<p>
ArtSci99 is a two-day symposium devoted to examining the history and nature
of exemplary art &amp; industry programs, "Modern-Day Leonardos," and the new
artist-scientist teams that presage the future of art-sci collaborations.
The biggest challenge lies in reaching-out to the various scientific
communities and gaining their support and involvement. But what type of
scientist or artist wants to collaborate? And why? 

<p>
Scientists at the top of their fields have achieved success by
understanding creativity as central to problem-solving. This means engaging
in a process that is fluid and flexible. These scientists are most likely
to be the ones who value collaborating with artists on projects that
require both of their unique and various perspectives. Today, we find more
and more artists inspired by and interpreting the impact of developments in
the wide and quite diverse fields of applied and theoretical science,
medicine, psychology, mechanics and technology. As well, many scientists
are looking for ways to interpret their work visually and aurally and to
provide a more humanistic rendering of discoveries in their field. 
The event format for ArtSci99 will include: keynotes, presentations by
artist-scientist teams, panel discussions on topics dear to the heart and
work of both artists and scientists, topical break-out sessions for more
personal interaction, social activities, and pre-event online discussions.
This program has been devised to achieve specific objectives: *dispel
misconceptions, *move beyond polar stereotypes, *inform and inspire re:
historical and current collaborations, *illuminate the strong commonalties
between art and science, *increase mutual understanding and respect through
communication, and *perpetuate a nurturing environment for collaborations. 

<p>
Our artist and scientist panelists will tackle a variety of questions in
relation to the nature of collaboration on the following topics: Reports
from the Front: What was the nature of past art-sci collaborations?;
Art-Sci at the Millennium: Why Now?; Scientific Theories Defining
Creativity and its Effect on Collaboration; and Bio-Ethics: The Response by
Art and Science. 
<br>
ArtSci99 will be important not only to artists and scientists but to
educators, researchers, writers, representatives from the technology
industry and city/government agencies, funding sources, and anyone who is
captivated by the intersection of art and science and interested in the
implications of its future direction. 

<p>
For 11 years, ASCI (Art &amp; Science Collaborations, Inc.), a NYC-based
non-profit organization, has produced member services and public events
that highlight and nurture the intersection of art and science. Visit
<a href="http://www.asci.org">http://www.asci.org</a> for history &amp; projects. ArtSci98 -- brought together
top research scientists, artists, writers, and theorists from fields as
varied as astronomy, chemistry, marine biology, computer animation,
invention, science fiction, mathematics, digital special effects, visual
art and music. This distinguished group presented the concepts of their
most current work in relation to the nature of creativity. (Archived program)
