FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         November 15, 1999 
 
<a name="2202qlink1">WATCH RARE PASSAGE OF MERCURY BEFORE THE SUN ON WEB</a> TODAY
      
     Today, a rare astronomical phenomenon occurs when Mercury 
</pre>
passes directly between the Earth and the Sun for the final time 
this century. This particular Mercury transit will be of a 
particular type that has not occurred since the invention of the 
telescope, and is not expected again at least through the 23rd 
century. 

<p>
     An important reminder -- do not attempt to view the Mercury 
transit with the naked eye or with a telescope or binoculars. The 
Sun can cause severe eye damage and even blindness. Telescope 
images of the event from JPL will be fed live on the Internet at 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mercurytransit">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mercurytransit</a> today between about 1 to 
2:15 p.m. Pacific time (4 to 5:15 Eastern). 

<p>
     Mercury will graze just inside the Sun's disk for less than 
an hour between 1:11 p.m. and 2:10 p.m. as seen from Los Angeles. 

<p>
     Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, passes Earth every 
116 days. But because Mercury's orbit is tilted seven degrees 
relative to Earth's orbit, only about one in 23 of Mercury's 
passages between the Sun and Earth results in a transit.  The 
most recent Mercury transits occurred in 1970, 1973, 1986 and 
1993, but they were not visible in Los Angeles.  After the 
November 15 transit, the next one visible from Los Angeles will 
take place on November 8, 2006.
 
<p>
     NASA's Telescopes in Education project, managed by JPL, is 
sponsoring telescope coverage of the event. JPL is managed for 
NASA by the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.
