<a name="0579qlink1">Or, what about the fact that there are today MORE rapes of men by men 
committed inside prisons than all the rapes throughout society of women?  
The victims are usually young first offenders, mariuana users, etc.  And the 
consequences are likely to be much worse, including often a death sentence 
due to AIDS.  Yet I would bet that less than $1 is spent dealing with this 
attrocity for every $10,000 spent dealing with the rape of women.  It only 
adds irony to injustice to note that a large number of the rapes of women is 
actually committed by the very former inmates who were themselves raped</a> in 
prison.
