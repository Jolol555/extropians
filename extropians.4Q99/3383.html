Probably you would have to ask this question to the person described
in the original post.  My comments were based on observation of how people respond to certain topics, and possible reasons for that.

<a name="3388qlink1">I agree that making some topics taboo does not promote understanding between humans.  On the other hand, not every human will want to talk about every topic, there is a set of preferences involved.  It would be nice to know someone's preferences ahead of time, most of the time one has to make an educated guess.  Sometimes, one is pleasantly surprised at the range of topics available, such as among the persons on this list.</a>

Take care,
