Hello everyone,

<p>
I didn't realize until reading an essay I found on the web that I had fallen 
in with a group of...MUTATIONISTS!  People without a shred of morality who 
will lead us into a global civil war of battling super-mutants!  We are so 
consumed with lust for technology, novelty and power we are blinded as to 
what makes human life worth living!
<br>
This essay I feel makes some very interesting but also at times highly 
short-sighted criticisms of transhumanism.  I thought some of you would find 
reviewing and rebutting it an appealling task.  The author does give us 
credit for at least the present not planning to create slave races!

<p>
This essay may have already come to the attention of the list members and if 
so I apologize but I thought if it had not it would be worth posting.

<p>
Karl Jahn wrote this and I found it with just a general search engine 
search.  So if I can many more will over time.  The url is 
<a href="http://members.tripod.com/karljahn/trans.html">http://members.tripod.com/karljahn/trans.html</a> for this fellow's homepage 
where he shares alot of other views with visitors.

<p>
I look forward to how this would be picked apart by list members.  If some 
extropians reached out to him he would perhaps in some way concede that he 
did not give us a chance.  Damien Broderick comes to mind when I think of 
someone to contact him.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg

defense of Humanity:  Against Transhumanism

<p>
In the course of my exploration of cyberspace, I discovered an ideology 
called "transhumanism," a term redolent of (seemingly harmless) 
crankishness. Some of it
<br>
was interesting and appealing: its emphasis on the power of science to 
improve the human condition. Some of it was disturbing and repulsive: the 
notion of moving
<br>
beyond humanity. Suddenly I realized: "Ye gods -- they're Mutationists!"

<p>
Mutationism, you see, was something I had invented, as part of a 
science-fiction scenario, on which I have fitfully tried to base a series of 
stories. I felt nothing but
<br>
shock and horror when I realized that my prophecy was starting to come true, 
decades before the time it was set in. You will understand my horror when 
you read
<br>
the scenario:

<p>
     The early Space Age was a period of rapid scientific and technical 
progress in every field. In most areas, this progress was but a continuation 
of earlier
<p>
     developments: but biological technology, or biotech, was a radically 
new departure. It was even more fraught with peril than atomic energy, since 
it
<p>
     could be, and inevitably was, applied to man himself. The unleashing of 
these strange and terrible new powers interrupted the conquest of space with 
a
<p>
     fourth and final World War.

<p>
     The advance of biotech revived, in a new form, many old, half-forgotten 
ideas about the social implications of biology. These had traditionally been
<p>
     associated with the political Right (first with aristocracy, and later 
with racism), and as such, they had been banished from intellectual 
discourse for
<p>
     political reasons after the defeat of National Socialism. Along with it 
had gone eugenics, although it was ambiguous in Left/Right terms: a 
progressive,
<p>
     rationalist plan for the secular salvation of humanity through 
selective breeding.

<p>
     Now applied biology could take shortcuts, and avoid the invidious 
implications of eugenics; for even the defectives, through genetic surgery, 
could have
<p>
     healthy and superior offspring. The new powers and opportunities 
inspired a large, multifarious ideological movement, generally called 
Mutationism. The
<p>
     Mutationists embraced the new technologies of biological engineering to 
reshape the human race. Different Mutationists naturally proposed different
<p>
     mutations, dividing the movement into quarrelling factions, each 
spawning a new race in the image of its particular ideal. ...

<p>
     The full development of Mutationism ... was [very] diverse, but its 
overall tendency was to divide the human race into two (or more) species: a
<p>
     master-race of supermen, and a slave-race (or races) of submen. To make 
matters worse, of course, there were dozens of rival master-races, each
<p>
     seeking to reproduce itself faster, to grow stronger, than its rivals.

<p>
     Mutationism in turn aroused a contrary movement, Humanism, comprised of 
all those concerned about the perils of applying these techniques to man
<p>
     himself. They warned that this threatened to abolish man's very nature, 
and feared the chaos and void this would leave. Could man, once unmade, be
<p>
     remade? they asked. What standard of value could be used to judge 
biological "improvements" in the absence of a fixed human nature? ...

<p>
     At first it seemed possible to find a middle ground between the two 
sides. Haphazard attempts were made to limit or control the new techniques, 
while
<p>
     numerous piecemeal changes, each small enough in itself, proved so 
desirable as to be objects of nearly universal consensus, accepted even by 
the
<p>
     doubters. Hereditary diseases such as hemophilia were rooted out, and 
<a name="0838qlink1">tendencies towards longevity were reinforced. The human body was improved
<p>
     by eliminating such vestigial, useless, and sometimes harmful items as 
</a>
the appendix, tonsils, [and] wisdom teeth....

<p>
     Finally, however, the conflict escalated beyond all reason and 
compromise. The peril was obvious: normal humanity would be supplanted; and 
then the
<p>
     various master-races would be unwilling to share the honors with each 
other, and would covet each other's lands and slave-races. Race-war followed
<p>
     inevitably: a war to the death. Any sense of common humanity with or 
between these bioengineered races was long since lost.

<p>
     The Humanists grew stronger with the general reaction against such 
excesses, and more militant in campaigning for the control of biotech. 
States were
<p>
     torn apart, or one party or the other came to power. Once again, nearly 
a century of peace was broken by a series of immense and unprecedented
<p>
     wars. The Mutant and Clone Wars were the most ruthless of all wars, for 
the stakes were the very existence of humanity.

<p>
     Fortunately for the cause of natural man, the Mutationists worked 
against each other as often as together; their internal disunity, again and 
again,
<p>
     thwarted them on the verge of victory, and at last brought them down in 
defeat. The losers in the race-wars were exterminated, unless they were
<p>
     resourceful or lucky enough to go into hiding, and ultimately escape to 
other planets. ...

<p>
     The Mutant and Clone Wars were truly a global civil war, for both 
parties were international, and every advanced nation was divided within 
itself.
<p>
     Therefore, the victorious Humanist governments promulgated the uniform 
Genetic Laws, codifying the new and more literal "crimes against humanity,"
<p>
     and established a single global state, the World Federation, to enforce 
these laws stringently and uniformly.

<p>
(Perhaps I should mention that I regard the very idea of world government <br>
with intense suspicion and distaste; but it would be an infinitely lesser 
evil than the
<br>
abolition of man.)

<p>
Transhumanism today is only the embryo of the Mutationism I envisioned. So 
far, the transhumanists seem to have no interest in creating slave-races, 
and none of
<br>
them have any clear idea of what sort of "posthuman" race(s) they want. 
Indeed, they put much stress on the fact that "posthumans" will be so far 
superior to us that
<br>
they will be incomprehensible. Presumably this will change as technology 
advances and concrete options become available; but we should pause and 
wonder at the
<br>
state of mind of people so eager to transform themselves into who-knows-what 
kind of utterly alien being.

<p>
Most of them (at the moment) seem to belong politically to the 
libertarian/individualist Left, so it is likely that each of them, given the 
power, would mutate himself in
<br>
some unique way, and be solely concerned with his own egotistical and 
Narcissistic gratification: certainly no great loss, and maybe no great 
danger, to the human
<br>
race. But egalitarian/collectivist ideas appear frequently enough to raise 
the specter of an attempt to transform humanity into a single gigantic 
hive-mind, like Star
<br>
Trek's Borg. Already, then, one can see the potential for the clash of at 
least two über-Nazi super-races.

<p>
In any event, if the transhumanists have their way (and I doubt that there 
is any scientific reason why they couldn't, though I get some comfort from 
the probability
<br>
that the technology is still decades away), we will still face the problem 
of a world divided between mankind and one or more "posthuman" super-races. 
I shudder to
<br>
think of the fate of those not ready, willing or able to join their 
glittery, sinister utopia. If the "posthumans" are so powerful and so alien, 
they would have no more
<br>
compunction about exterminating us than invading Martians would.

<p>
The transhumanists might or might not be psychologically pathological, but 
they are undoubtedly afflicted with a spiritual pathology. They are in fact 
the most extreme
<br>
example and synthesis of a complex of spiritual pathologies: the worship of 
wealth, power, novelty, machinery. In short, they idolize means at the 
expense of ends.
<br>
Such idolaters habitually conflate "can" and "should": to them it seems 
self-evident that if we can do something, we should do it -- regardless of 
the consequences.
<br>
They want to leap into the dark -- into a darkness all too likely to be a 
bottomless abyss.

<p>
Nothing could be more dangerous than technology without morality, unlimited 
means ungoverned by ethical ends. Every advance of technology should be 
challenged
<br>
with the simple question: "Why?" Transhumanists, and less extreme idolaters, 
ask only "Why not?" The answer to their question is that means should serve 
ends, and
<br>
not become ends in themselves. Nothing can be good unless it serves a truly 
good end.

<p>
<a name="0834qlink1">No objective standard of value is possible unless it is grounded in nature, 
i.e. in objective reality. Other than nature, there are only two alternative 
</a>
standards:
<br>
whatever we happen to want, or whatever God wants (which means, in practice, 
whatever those who pretend to speak for God happen to want). If the standard 
of
<br>
nature is rejected, desire is liberated from morality: no desire is either 
good or evil.

<p>
Transhumanists explicitly celebrate the "liberation" from nature, and at 
least tacitly celebrate the liberation from morality. At the same time they 
celebrate the potential
<br>
of mind-altering drugs of the kind Aldous Huxley foresaw and called "soma," 
now exemplified by Prozac. Desire itself, the only standard of value that 
transhumanists
<br>
can conceive of, will be infinitely malleable in the Brave New World they 
envision. This begs the question that they cannot answer: What should we 
desire?

<p>
Here is my own answer: We should desire to make ourselves better human 
beings, not "posthuman" beings. Man, at his best, is quite good enough. The 
problem is
<br>
to enable the whole human race to live up to the potential inherent in human 
nature. This is the goal set by nature. (For more details, see my 
"Foundation of Ethics").

<p>
Eugenics, despite all its excesses and abuses under the Nazi regime, was 
benign compared to transhumanism. The eugenicists' ambition was to make the 
human race
<br>
more fully human: stronger, healthier, more beautiful, more intelligent. 
Their standard was set by human nature, which was taken as given; they only 
wanted to enable
<br>
the whole of mankind (or in the Nazis' case, only one part of mankind) to 
flourish according to that standard.

<p>
Properly guided, genetic engineering could achieve the same goal by less 
problematic means. But such is the intellectual confusion, moral imbecility, 
and willful
<br>
ugliness of our age that the goal itself has become problematic. 
Transhumanism is nothing more than intellectual confusion, moral imbecility, 
and willful ugliness
<br>
elaborated into a self-conscious ideology and deliberately applied to the 
whole range of potential 21st century technologies, but particularly to 
genetic engineering.

<p>
The ultimate irony is that in their ambition to be more than human, 
transhumanists can only succeed in being less than human. Their lust for 
wealth, power, novelty and
<br>
machinery blinds them to everything that makes a human life worth living; 
which is, I suppose, precisely why they are so eager to become "posthumans."
