&gt; A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies<br>

<p>
<a name="2125qlink1">We have to go beyond this moral idea that it is not 'right' that these things 
can happen or that the 'standards' are not OK in some parts of the academic 
</a>world.  People who know some bits of good technology and some good scientific 
tricks should USE them, directly, to gain benefits for themselves; thereby 
demonstrating directly that these tricks and technologies work.  And thereby 
*bypassing* entirely those stuffy, bureaucratic, self-important and brain-dead 
people being 'exposed' in this story about the article in 'Social Text'. 

<p>
Technology and science is a living and utilitarian thing, which must always 
demonstrate its usefulness directly and materialistically; it is not a thing 
like ''art'' or ''politics'', in which people's arbitrary opinions count more 
than the real, objective, self-demonstrating usefulness of a thing.  The 
basics of science and technology is the simple common sense that says that a 
theory or a bit of technology must be *useful* (else why bother with it).  I 
have some confidence that this will more or less automatically keep groups 
engaged in science and technology rid of the kind of thing described for the 
Social Text article.
