Or you think you do.  You could be "experiencing" the illusion of belief in 
what you're saying here.

I'm going to call your bluff.  You claim to believe that there are such 
things as first principles from which everything else may be derived, but 
you have yet to divulge any other than A=A, which is, while indeed a valid 
first principle, a less than interesting one which will yield you very 
little in the way of derivation.  And you have conspicuously failed to 
answer my request to provide others, which should not be a tremendous chore, 
considering that you seem to believe that there are very few.  Therefore, I 
am unconvinced that you /are/ in fact following logic rather than your own 
kind of dogma.  If I am wrong, then prove it; don't expect me to believe you 
on say-so.
