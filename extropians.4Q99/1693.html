<p>
No, Hal didn't say that.  Hal said that *admitting the possibility* was
a horrible thing because then he couldn't go around saying that miracles
were *absolutely impossible*.  I'm the one advocating the view that you
use Occam's Razor and probabilities.

<p>
<a href="1675.html#1693qlink2">&gt; What Hal is saying (IMHO) is that accepting the premise of</a><br>
<i>&gt; interventionist Powers leads on to a strong possibility that these</i><br>
<i>&gt; same (or other) Powers have intervened in the past in ways just like</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been 'reported' in the Bible and elsewhere.</i><br>

<p>
If he's saying that, then he's wrong.  Unless you can come up with a
coherent (informationally compact) set of motives that would lead to a
given set of interventions and non-interventions, then the fact that
interventionist Powers exist certainly does not imply the possible
existence of a particular kind of (humanly visible) intervention, much
less the truth of any given set of accounts.

<p>
<a href="1675.html#1693qlink3">&gt; He is, therefore pointing out the contradiction in people who strongly</a><br>
<i>&gt; support one and strongly disagree with the other.</i><br>

<p>
Once again:  This is entirely possible; all it takes is Occam's Razor.
