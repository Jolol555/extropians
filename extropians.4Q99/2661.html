<OL>
<a name="2666qlink1">  <li>  ketosis is what actually kills diabetics, most of the time
  <li>  no organism uses ketosis as its normal state if it doesn't have to; all 
*could*, but none do.
</a>
  <li>  The body manifestly lacks the regulation of ketones it displays for glucose
Glucose is kept within narrow limits and conserved in the body; but ketones
are neither properly regulated nor conserved.
  <li>  A prior version of Atkins, called the "meat diet" was canned in the 30's 
due
to a high rate of heart disease.
  <li>  Byproduct of the ketotic cycles, including acetone, are directly toxic


</OL>
<p>
Now none of this proves that ketosis, in toto, is detrimental to modern 
humans.
<br>
Weight loss and lowered glucose are good things.  A good scientist who 
respected the health of his followers would accordingly perform animal tests
to determine the long-term effects of ketosis.  Atkins doesn't.
  
<p>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink3">&gt;  James Sez:  I have been in ketosis for over a month now.  Never nauseous.</a><br>
<i>&gt;  I do smell different in both mouth and sweat....mate thinks it is </i><br>
different,  but
<br>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink4">&gt;  not worse.  I lift weights for exercise and note that the number of reps I </a><br>
can
<br>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink5">&gt;  do at various weight levels has declined a little.  I would think this i  </a><br>
because
<br>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink6">&gt;  I have less reserve energy stored in the muscles eventhough I take </a><br>
creatine.
<br>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink7">&gt;  The max weight I can lift has not declined.  </a><br>

<p>
That's better than usual; certainly far better than some of my parent's 
friends
<br>
who were afraid to drive.  These things do vary.

<p>
<i>&gt;  However, I feel much more</i><br>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink8">&gt;  energetic now that the hi-sugar /  low sugar cycle is eliminated-Adkins</a><br>
<i>&gt;  quotes studies that show all the body's tissues including the brain and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  major organs like the heart can utilize ketones as easily as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  glucose for energy, contrary to knee jerk opinion in the Establishment.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fact, some studies showed that some tissues prefer ketones!</i><br>

<p>
That's in the textbooks, actually.  So Atkins is still posing as "persecuted" 
when
<br>
his ideas get wide acceptance *provided there is data*. Interesting.  Sounds 
like
<br>
he's trying to sucker in conspiracy theorists.

<p>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink9">&gt;  James Sez:  Dr. Adkins recommends a moderate low carbohydrate diet</a><br>
<i>&gt;  after your target weight is obtained.  One would be in ketosis only part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the time on the long term diet.   </i><br>

<p>
Researchers have tried this technique in hospitals fat loss clinics.  People
coming off the diet typically experience extreme carbohydrate cravings.

<p>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink10">&gt;  Adkins thinks you cannot be healthly unless in</a><br>
<i>&gt;  ketosis at least part of the time.   Only in ketosis can body clean-out</i><br>
<i>&gt;  excess cholesterol, etc. from arteries!  If you have all the energy you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  need from a carbs all the time, the body cannot deal with whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fat is left in the diet to deposit God Knows Where!??  </i><br>

<p>
Atkins can't possibly be that ignorant.  The liver can process fat to other
things and fat cells take it up avidly.  Plaque regression happens just fine 
w/o
<br>
ketosis (c.f. work on Pritikin and Ornish diets)

<p>
<i>&gt;No fat mobilization in "GLUCOSIS" according to Adkins...a dangerous </i><br>
situation???

<p>
So dangerous every metazoan species on earth that can use it uses it ...
 
<p>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink11">&gt;  James Sez Further:  Where is the data proving the body is not adapted</a><br>
<i>&gt;  for ketosis?  Didn't humans probably evolve with the ability to store</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and then use fat?  I would think that in many climates, folks would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  eat lots of carbs during the summer, get fat, and then live partially</i><br>
<i>&gt;  off stored fat during the "hard winter" months.  I would suspect that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  primitives living in a "hard climate" purposely got fat whenever possible.</i><br>

<p>
And, interestingly, Eskimos, who eat a ketosis-inducing diet, are more
resistant to ketosis!  Apparently the body dodges ketosis when it can.

<p>
You are correct that occaisional ketosis is normal for people and we must
be able to tolerate short periods of it fairly well.  They might still be bad 
for
<br>
us.  Or good.  Dr. Atkins apparently doesn't want us to know.

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Research on the long-term</i><br>
<a href="2600.html#2661qlink12">&gt;&gt; safety of ketotic diets is zilch, which I consider inexcusable given</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; than Dr. Atkins has been pushing this diet for 25 years.  Not even a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; rodent study!  Dr. Atkins' diet may be a good thing, but he is a quack.</i><br>
  
<p>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink13">&gt;  James Sez:  Is this Dr. Adkin's fault or the fault of Establishment science</a><br>
<i>&gt;  that rejects the diet without any evidence?  </i><br>

<p>
His fault.  Nobody stopped him from doing the experiments.

<p>
<i>&gt;  Quack?  That is a pretty</i><br>
<a href="2657.html#2661qlink14">&gt;  extreme statement.  Are rodents evolved to eat meat?  Studies are</a><br>
<i>&gt;  expensive.</i><br>

<p>
Humans are valuable.  Is the health of millions of people worth less than
$50,000 for a rodent study?  An omnivore like a pig would indeed be a better
model, although rodents will eat meat.
