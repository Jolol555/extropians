Yes, I understand that. I think that the world would probably contain less
violence if matrons would refrain from telling their sons that they are good for
nothing other than dying for something. Of course violence has its advocates,
but I find it disingenuous to blame men for the violence in the world when
mothers encourage their sons to engage in violence. I think men who choose not
to do violent things deserve as much respect as womyn who choose not to do
violence.
