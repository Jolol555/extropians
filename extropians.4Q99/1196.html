Robin--to clarify my comments, let me know that I have not (yet) read
Shiller's paper, and it was not me who introduced the term "technical
analysis" to the discussion. I stand by my comments on technical analysis,
but I am not saying they apply to Shiller since I haven't read his paper.
According to what I just read by Hal, what Shiller is doing is more like
fundamental analysis, not technical analysis, so perhaps his procedure is
perfectly reasonable. So, I was not dismissing Shiller's work by throwing
that label at it. I was merely responding to someone else's use of the
term. If Shiller does not depend on technical analysis then I would have no
objection to his approach (though I might still think his conclusion
mistaken).

<p>
This can often be true, but there is also enormous evidence that it is
possible to follow rules that let you "buy high, sell higher". I am
thinking of momentum investing with high quality companies (not simple
momentum strategies that ignore important factors).

  Shiller then *tests* this expectation

<p>
Robin, I am certainly not dismissing his analysis because it refers to real
data. I don't see how you could make that interpretation from what I said!
I was criticizing technical analysis, and someone else said or implied that
Shiller was using technical analysis. Since I haven't read Shiller's paper,
I did not make any judgment about his work. My whole point was that
technical analysis ignores much "real data", so how could I be faulting him
for using real data?
