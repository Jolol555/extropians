<i>&gt;  suggestion we could come up with was to try to emulate the process that </i><br>
<i>&gt;  occurred with genetic technology in the 1970s, where a regime of </i><br>
<i>&gt;  self-regulation developed and was slowly adopted into regulatory law.  In </i><br>
<i>&gt;  short, the group suggested prescriptions of release of freely autonomous </i><br>
<i>&gt;  replicators into the environment and some technical safeguards against </i><br>
<i>&gt;  mutation.</i><br>

<p>
Unfortunately, the regime has never been tested as it has since turned out 
that our engineered organisms do poorly in the wild. We probably *could* 
design invaders if we wanted to but the traits we want actually seem to harm 
the organisms in the wild.  Added to the fact that most successful invaders 
don't cause serious problems for humans anyway, the chance of a catastrophe 
was always small, so we don't know how much good the safeguards did us.

<p>
Deliberate bio- or nanowarfare might be a different story, but that's not 
under discussion here.

<a href="2146.html#2148qlink2">&gt;The group was not optimistic that these measures could completely and </a><br>

<p>
As I pointed out, we have little info on whether such measures can even 
forestall a nanotech disaster.
