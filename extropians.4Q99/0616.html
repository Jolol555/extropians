The Standard Diagnostic Nomenclature of the American Psychiatric
Association includes in its description of "sociopathy" "the inability
to experience shame or guilt" and "the absence of internalized
ethical or moral standards of conduct", i.e. conscience, and in
general "displays an amorphous hostile disregard of society".

<p>
Are you really that uncomfortable with the idea devoting your life,
even sacrificing it if necessary, to an Ideal or Purpose whose value
and importance vastly exceed your own?

<p>
The issue I would like to focus on is why many of us believe that
life, human or otherwise, is valuable and how it came to pass that
someone can be a member of a group and regard all other members
("human lives") as devoid of the value you attribute to yourself?</a>

<p>
<a name="0624qlink2">Do you really believe a life as a "transhistorical, augmented and
superior being" lived in "splendid isolation" would be worth the

for its own sake, that your relationship with others is entirely
manipulative and exploitative in order to meet you uniquely
</a>
valuable needs?

<p>
<a name="0624qlink4">If you, Sayke, have no "intrinsic value" this does not prevent you
considering your goals, hopes and intentions as having some sort
of unique extrinsic value.</a> You were born with the conviction that
<a name="0624qlink5">only what you wanted was worth attention, and utterly shocked
to find that your parents had needs too and and could not reliably
provide immediate gratification.  In fact, they even expected you
to tolerate unpleasant bladder pressure so you would not urinate
on the living room rug?</a>

<p>
<a name="0624qlink6">I've never understood the moral philsophy of "Solipsism", so your
motivation and attitude remain a mystery to me.  This post is
in no way critical -- it is driven by an intense curiosity about
the issues you raise in relation to Extropianism.</a>  Is it really true
<a name="0624qlink7">that all of us, despite our denials and rationalizations, are
egoists engaged in an EXCLUSIVE and ruthless search for
self-aggrandizement?</a>
