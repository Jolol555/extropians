<p>
What's beating?  After years of being an Intel imitator, this summer AMD
released the K-7, which articles I read called a year ahead of Intel's release
schedule.  Intel probably has a bigger share of the market, but AMD is gaining
ground and pulling ahead in products.  So, (a) it'd be a shame if AMD had
gotten squished in the past, and (b) Intel probably can't be called a
monopoly.  I'm not sure if it ever was.  Cyrix was an imitator as well, and
even if AMD and Cyrix had never grown in market share, just their thread
should keep Intel's prices down.

<p>
And Linux is obviously growing, although not an obvious direct competitor with
MS products.

I know what you did, but not what you called.  FOC expands</a> to?
