<a name="0515qlink1"><a href="0494.html#0500qlink1">&gt;It is not that simple.  If you can't take care of yourself, society </a><br>
<i>&gt;(government, private organizations, your family) will take care of you.</i><br>

<p>
And they shouldn't is my point.  A society that chooses to burden themselves 
is a stupid society.  A society of ignorant, stupid citizens</a> or 
representatives.

<p>
<a name="0515qlink2"><a href="0494.html#0500qlink2">&gt;It simply is not in the nature of most of us, to enjoy luxuries while </a><br>
<i>&gt;people around us are starving.</i><br>

<p>
Obviously you have never lived on the streets.  I had lived on the streets 
for 2 years and I had also held well paid positions in large companies.  I 
speak from experience when I say most people do enjoy luxuries while people 
around them are starving.  People starve if they choose to, why should you 
care what life they choose for themselves?</a>

<p>
<a name="0515qlink3"><a href="0494.html#0500qlink3">&gt;Hence, society will try to pressure you into getting educated no matter </a><br>
<i>&gt;what.</i><br>

<p>
Most people who are homeless are there due to mental illness.  It doesn't 
matter how much education you give them they will never get any better, and 
who's to say they want</a> to.  Give them the choice of augmenting their mind 
<a name="0515qlink4">but don't force them.  If they choose to stay the way they are then so be 
it.  It's not my problem and I won't allow it to be either.  Why will I 
burden myself over someone who doesn't want to be helped?  I'm not.  A 
burdened society brings it upon themselves.</a>

<p>
<a name="0515qlink5"><a href="0494.html#0500qlink4">&gt;It may well be your education is nobody else's business, but society does </a><br>
<i>&gt;have a vested interest in making sure that you are capable of taking care </i><br>
<i>&gt;of yourself and making a positive contribution to society.</i><br>

<p>
Again, don't.  Society burdens themselves when they force people to do 
things they don't want to do.  If someone wants to kill themselves whether 
they are mental or not, so what.  It's a choice they make and not for me to 
tell them otherwise.</a>

<p>
<a name="0515qlink6"><a href="0494.html#0500qlink5">&gt;I think it is 'wrong headed' the way society tries to pressure people into </a><br>
<i>&gt;getting more years of 'education', instead of encouraging learning of all </i><br>
<i>&gt;types.  But society looks after its own self interest, and attempting to </i><br>
<i>&gt;make society not do that because of 'principals' is like arguing with a </i><br>
<i>&gt;hungry lion. You can't win.</i><br>

<p>
Winning is just a matter of showing people their ignorance.  Start by 
tearing apart their stupid religious and moral faith.<a name="0505qlink1">  Then give them a new 
</a>
logical moral.  The new moral code is based of the self.<a name="0505qlink2">  What it takes for 
the individual to survive and live any way it pleases.</a>
