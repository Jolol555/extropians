<a href="3151.html#3389qlink1">&gt; Second, talk of dismantling Mars will turn that group against you:</a><br>
<i>&gt; Expect the  "peasants storming Frankenstein's castle" reaction.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mars Society is  HEAVILY influenced by Kim Stanley Robinson's books</i><br>
<i>&gt; (they are considered as a  kind of scripture among the group's</i><br>

Has anyone pointed out to them how astonishingly ignorant of economics 
<a name="3391qlink1"><a name="3390qlink1">those books are?  I've read them, and mostly enjoyed them as good adventure 
</a>
<a name="3391qlink2">store, but I had to treat them less as science fiction than as economic 
</a>
fiction.  There's no commerce of any kind in the book.  And it's not just 
the usual "it's not part of the story line, so I don't have to include it", 
</a>
<a name="3391qlink3">it's actively denied as part of the story.  (Communal living, communal 
values, you know.)  No buying and selling, but everyone always has plenty 
of water, food, air, and shelter, except when a crisis is happening.

<a name="3391qlink4">There's no way a society could exist under those conditions, let alone 
grow, and evolve.  Does the "law and governance" crowd expect supplies to 
arrive everywhere by magic, or are they confronting these problems?
