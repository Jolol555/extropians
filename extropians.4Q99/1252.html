<i>&gt;differentiating offenses on the basis of intent or premeditation.  If I </i><br>
<i>&gt;murder</i><br>
<i>&gt;you, why does it matter whether I planned it ahead of time?  Are you any </i><br>
<i>&gt;more</i><br>
<i>&gt;or less dead?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Similarly, I object to laws against drunk driving.  The offense should be</i><br>
<i>&gt;"impaired driving" or "reckless endangerment".  If I hit you with my car, </i><br>
<i>&gt;you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are just as injured whether I am impaired because I was drinking, I'm </i><br>
<i>&gt;stoned,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have a bad cold, or I just broke up with my girlfriend.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And why is conspiracy a crime?  Why is "conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor"</i><br>
<i>&gt;a felony?</i><br>
Because the whole idea is to morally reform the miscreant.  After all, the 
<a name="1274qlink1">Bible equates lusting in ones heart to actual</a> adultary.  So our legal system 
follows from the religious morality - God KNOWS what is in your mind and 
heart, and so can the D.A.
<br>
It is true that the sort of person who kills random strangers for a thrill 
is much more a danger and less desireable to keep around in normal society 
than the person who made a tragic mistake in driving and killed someone "by 
accident."  So, when we do manage to identify someone as a psychopath, or 
with severe moral impairment that puts everyone around them at general risk, 
then we should act accordingly in our own interest, personally and 
collectively.  Punishment, however, had not been shown to have the slightest 
impact on changing someone's morals or in making them less accident prone.
So, we punish people in order to get revenge and to make the psychopath 
think twice - as a deterent.  And, of course, incarcertation as punishment 
also offers the advantage of putting them where they can't harm us.
The real answer, however, is an explicit social contract that would simply 
restrict dangerous people to areas where they are not a threat (while they 
are paying restitution to any victims).  As they demonstrate better 
appreciation for the consequences of their actions, their social credit 
rating would corresponding improve as the rates to get bonded, insurance, 
etc., would fall, improving their access to society, shopping malls, roads, 
etc.
