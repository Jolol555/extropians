structure sentences "This IS the way it is..." rather than "perhaps it is

You cannot say whether or not those that claiming this as fact are "reading
too much in" though, as you have no data. I see it as a distinct possibility
that this "common knowledge" has a basis in scientific research, but I
wouldn't bet my life on it.
