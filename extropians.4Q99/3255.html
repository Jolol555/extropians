the whole country.  There hasn't been any point in reading _Rise and
Fall_ where I said:  "But how could people do that?"  It isn't a very
pleasant experience, but it does reaffirm one's faith in transhumanism.</a>

<a name="3267qlink1">"Hitler was inhuman", you say.  Why?  Because you think of yourself as
being "human", and everyone in your group must be good guys, and all the
bad guys must be in another group.<a name="3400qlink3">  This group polarization reflex is,
</a>
of course, one of the same pieces of mindware underlying the success of
the Nazi racial-superiority meme.  By calling Hitler inhuman, one is
demonstrating (1) that one shares the same basic mindware with Hitler
and all other human beings, thus demonstrating (2) the falsity of (a)
one's own statement, (b) the Nazi philosophy, and (c) the mindware itself.</a>

<p>
A cosmic, cruel, and Hofstadterian joke.
