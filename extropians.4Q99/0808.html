I hope you aren't referring to me by this.  I am not in the business of PR.
 That's what we play publicists money for.

<p>
Not a good analogy, although I realize you are using an extreme. (At least
I hope</a> you are -:)

<p>
If two people I respect have a disagreement, I'd wade it and pay close
attention to the overtures.  Fighting is tricky.  Just because someone
wants to "fight" doesn't mean that it is consensual.  What may look like a
fight may be no more than a bit of wind in the other person's hair -- or
even a bluster.  Whereas a disagreement, however strong, can be beneficial
in revealing character without all the gust.
