*Electrochemical intercalation of lithium into multiwall carbon nanotubes.<br>
Chemical Physics Letters. Here's the abstract:
 Electrochemical intercalation of lithium into carbon electrodes containing
multiwall nanotubes produced by the arc-electric technique has been carried
out in button cells. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 7Li NMR spectroscopy
coupled with electrochemical characterisation allow us to study the
structural modifications induced by the intercalation of the alkali metal
between the graphene shells and the nature of interactions between lithium
species and the host material. Furthermore, direct observation of individual
nanotubes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that while the
lithiated nanotubes are intercalated very inhomogeneously, the
electrochemical intercalation process seems to be reversible and to proceed
through the graphene walls via structural defects.
Here's the full paper (PDF-acrobat reader) I'm unsure if you can view the

*Peering at a machine that pries DNA apart. Harvard researchers have created<br>
the first atomic-resolution image of a donut-shaped enzyme, or helicase,
that unwinds the DNA double helix to expose its genetic letters for DNA
replication. Michael Sawaya, postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Tom
Ellenberger, associate professor of biological chemistry and molecular
pharmacology (BCMP), worked out the X-ray crystallographic structure
reported in the October 15 Cell.

*Errant nerve cells risk a clockwork death. HHMI researchers have discovered<br>
a new fail-safe mechanism that ensures proper wiring of the nervous system.
This checkpoint allows the burgeoning nervous system to winnow wayward
neurons whose meanderings could cause dangerous miswiring of neural
circuitry.

*Tularik expresses Genentech genes with IPO plans. "Snip" Back in the early<br>
1990s, before the dawn of dot-com companies, biotechnology was the fodder of
get-rich-quick stock market fantasies. Of course, not all were successful.
For every Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) or Genentech (NYSE: DNA), there were scores
of little outfits that never made a dime. As the S&amp;P 500 surged over the
past few years, many of these biotech firms had a tough time staying afloat.

*Outbursts Result in Controversy - Scientists have different ideas to<br>
explain the behavior of Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs). SGRs irregularly give
off short blasts of radiation in the gamma ray frequencies. Magnetar theory
gives an explanation, but other theories depend on the surrounding stellar
environment as well as a central neutron star.

*Cellular Tensegrity. An astoundingly wide variety of natural systems,<br>
including carbon atoms, water molecules, proteins, viruses, cells, tissues
and even humans and other living creatures, are constructed using a common
form of architecture known as tensegrity. The term refers to a system that
stabilizes itself mechanically because of the way in which tensional and
compressive forces are distributed and balanced within the structure.
