<a name="0179qlink1">This is another message that I sent to Chris, that may possibly of
general interest to the group.</a>  Chris's response indicated that he
was generally aware of my points and thought the idea was of some interest.

<a name="0179qlink2">Chris, you need to rethink this unless we get progress on the legal
front.  I was contacted by a person from Oregon a few days ago
about my perspective on aging research.   During the discussion
I pointed out the problems that the illegality of pre-death
cryonic suspensions drives up both our health care costs *and*
effectively *kills* people.</a>   If people who are undergoing frequent
strokes or who have degenerative brain diseases are kept alive, there
may be nothing left to "reanimate" if you freeze them after they die.

<p>
The basic evolutionary biology of aging says that even when we lick
one problem there will be another problem waiting behind that.  There
is a very good chance we will solve the organ transplant shortage
problem in the next 10 years.  If so, we may end up with old bodies
but increasingly frail brains.  I believe that natural neuronal
cell death (which is real, though not as severe as was thought
in the '50's &amp; '60's), *will* catch up with you past 150 years.
If we do not develop ways of stopping Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
neuronal cell death, etc. you will end up dead.  Adding replacement
cells and/or stimulating neuronal stem cell division may be
stop-gap measures.  The replacement cells will not help you
recover your former memories, education, etc. if the cells
that were holding that information died.

<p>
<a name="0181qlink1">Now, the obvious solution to this is to suspend yourself around
age 70-100 (before you have lost a lot of function) and wait for
the technology to get much better.

<p>
<a name="0179qlink3">Doing that requires a *significant* change in the legal environment.
I suggested to the person I spoke with, that after she investigated it
further, that Oregon might be an interesting place to put such
an innovative idea on the ballot.  They have a history of being
very innovative in health care funding as well as things like
"the right to die" [or suspend].  You probably want to do it
after "The First Immortal" comes out as a movie.
