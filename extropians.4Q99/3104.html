<a href="3094.html#3104qlink1">&lt;&lt; I don't think one should uplift based on affection.  I suggest again</a><br>
 octopodes for the reasons I gave earlier.  Dogs would be nice to do, though
 I think they would be harder in some ways.  Plus more people might see
 uplifting them as animal cruelty.&gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="3114qlink1">Actually, I think that affection might be one of the best reasons</a> I can think 
<a name="3114qlink2">of to uplift.  And while some people might call it animal cruelty,</a> I do not, 
<a name="3137qlink2"><a name="3114qlink3">and hey, some people probably think breeding dogs is also</a> animal cruelty.</a>
 
<p>
<a href="3094.html#3104qlink2">&lt;&lt; The case is not so clear as Glen would think.  I recommend he and others</a><br>
 read Darcy F. Morey's "The Early Evolution of the Domestic Dog" (in
 _American Scientist_ 82(4) July-August 1994) and Lyudmila N. Trut's "Early
 Canid Domestication: The Farm-Fox Experiment" (in _American Scientist_ 87(2)
 March-April 1999).  While I don't think humans have had no input into
 domestication, domestication (for dogs and other domesticated organisms) is
<a name="3114qlink7"> a type of niche exploitation.&gt;&gt;

<p>
I agree that in the case of dogs, we might have a situation where</a> the species 
<a name="3114qlink8">actually "chose" to be "domesticated".  I actually think that makes</a> it even 
<a name="3114qlink9">better to uplift dogs; we're not uplifting an enslaved species but our 
willing partners.    However, we certaily have been in the driver's</a> seat as 
<a name="3114qlink10">far as developing different breeds.  Do you think those early proto dogs 
really had in mind becoming toy poodles when they joined our hunting 
parties?&lt;G&gt;

<p>
<a href="3094.html#3104qlink3">&lt;&lt; Dogs used humans!  The furry bastards!:)  This whole uplifting thread might</a><br>
 merely be their attempt to change who sits at whose feet.:)&gt;&gt;

<p>
<a name="3114qlink11">It's all the insidious plan of Professor Peabody!  Soon humans shall be 
reduced to a mass of Shermans!&lt;rbsg&gt;

<p>
<a href="3094.html#3104qlink4">&lt;&lt; I'm with you there.  Though one would hope the SI brings with it rewards</a><br>
 such that an SI would not carry over any malevolence from its former state.
 Hard to say though, since this is highly speculative.
 
<p>
 Cheers!

Yes, one would hope.  Sometimes though, you've just got to do your best and 
let the chips fall where they may....though a juicy steak may help ease the 
transition.
