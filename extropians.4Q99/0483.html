(Being gently libertarian:)  I see no contradiction between these two "rights".
I can be ignorant and unproductive if I want to, and you don't have to support
me.  And vice versa.  Can you give me examples of situations where you believe
these conflict?

<p>
(Ditto:)  If a thing is not right for me to do or to prevent, it does not 
become right because a group of my friends want to do it, whether I have one 
friend or 100,000,000.  I do not concede the existence of collective rights 
distinct from the exact sum of the rights of the individuals.  Do you?  If so, 
why?
