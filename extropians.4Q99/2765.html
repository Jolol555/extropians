<a href="2749.html#2765qlink1">&lt;&lt; &gt;NOTHING IN THE UNIVERSE IS WORTH DYING FOR!&gt;&gt;</a><br>

<p>
Depends on what you value.
<br>
Also, there are more ways than one to die.

<p>
What do you do when your choices are do something antithetical to your whole 
being or die?  There is a certain way I want to live, or die trying to live.  
I want my life to extend into eternity, but I won't harm an innocent person 
to do it, because if I did, then it would not be me who lived, but an 
ego-dystonic version of me.  There are certain parameters to who I wish to 
be, and when up against those boundaries, it would be more valuable to live a 
few more seconds within them than centuries outside of them.  Now, having 
said that, I work very hard to keep myself out of those conditions, because I 
really want both.  I know this was just a jumping off point in the post, but 
it seemed like a good place to make the point.  Note, for me the main point 
is not quantity nor quality of life (though both are nice), but quality of 
character.
