Actually, that was me.  I generally don't care about attributions
much, but when a thread might generate replies referring specifically
to "Joe's point" or "Lee's idea" or "Eli's prediction", one should
make some effort to ensure that they are identified correctly.  You
might also refer to the idea as "gradualist" or "anti-singularity"
to be more generic.
