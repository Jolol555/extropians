&lt;nit&gt; Amphetamines is plural for the various amphetamine-based chemicals.
Stimulants, depressants, etc. are classes not chemicals.  Ritalin is a
member of the class stimulant, but is not a member of the chemical group
amphetamines.  Calling it a member of the amphetamines because it has
similar effects, side effects etc. is like calling meprobamate a member of
the benzodiazapines because it has similar effects, side effects, etc. to
those of valium.  &lt;/nit&gt;

<p>
I did.  Here it is:
<hr>
<br>
&lt;quote&gt;In the olden days a drug called "Ritalina" existed which contained
amphetamines.  Would the "Ritalin" be identical to "Ritalina"?&lt;/quote&gt;
<hr>

<p>
Amphetamines (with an "s") commonly refers to the entire class of
amphetamine-like drugs, of which "Ritalin" is one.  The quote did not say
that "Ritalina" contained amphetamine (the chemical).  Therefore, it is
plausible that "Ritalin" and "Ritalina" are in fact identical as both
appear to contain amphetamines (the class).

<p>
This mostly a confusion resulting from a class and an instance having the
same name.  A reference to amphetamine, as opposed to an amphetamine
(member of the set), would presumably have been written without the "s".

<p>
In any case, I don't see what the fuss is over.
