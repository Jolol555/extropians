JOIN THINK MARS ----- <a href="http://thinkmars.net/join.html">http://thinkmars.net/join.html</a>

<p>
We're gearing up for another round of research into the "business of
Mars and space."  Join the team now to work on issues like:


<UL>
  <li>  Can/should NASA be profit-making?
  <li>  How profitable is the space industry, today and
	throughout its history?
  <li>  From here to Mars: what are the critical technologies?
  <li>  Space and the Media:  Free Entertainment for the World
	at what cost to America?
  <li>  The struggle to start up: Space ventures vs. the Internet
  <li>  Plus a lot more


</UL>
<p>
Even if you're not located in Boston, you can participate virtually
through the Internet.  And perhaps a team of business school students
and engineers at your university/company can do a whole topic!
