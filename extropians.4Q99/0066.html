Apparently Robin Hanson writes:

The problem with such a merger in the current intellectual-property
environment is the problem of "proprietary standards", which should
be more widely recognized as the contradictio in adjectio it is.
Technological interoperability standards have become vastly more
important with the proliferation of electronic communications,
and the economic function they need to serve is at direct odds
with the economic function intended for intellectual property.

<p>
Until our social institutions for sorting out interoperability
standards from intellectual property (some of us would like to
see them firewalled from one another) have been somewhat
reformed, I could not in good conscience support such a merger.
