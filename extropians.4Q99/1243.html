Hello everyone,

<p>
I have been very interested in the religion bashing thread.  I was born 
Catholic and raised Mormon starting at age nine.  I even served a two year 
mission for my church in the late eighties.  That was one of the best and 
worst experiences of my life.

<p>
To help those of you who want more understanding on the religious/human 
experience I include these thoughts.  Some of what I include is from a past 
post where Greg Burch commented on his memories of growing up Catholic.  I 
think considering the present discussion it would be good to have it here 
again.

<a name="1303qlink1">"Religion" is a package of many things, most of them good.  It
is good to have organizations that promote moral values, community,
tradition; offer personal and family conseling; educate children;
promote voluntray charity; and do the other things religions do.
It is unfortunate that such organizations as are now popular in the
West also promote irrational faith.  But that's just part of the
package: let us villify that as it deserves, and strive to excise
that sickness from the otherwise valuable whole that is religion.</a>
Even "faith" itself is a package deal: it combines things that
we might call belief and commitment and trust.  Some of those things
are valuable as well in the right context and applied rationally.

<p>
I totally agree that religion is a "package" of many things which are very 
attractive to people looking for good and loyal friends, acceptance, a mate, 
wholesome recreation, family bonding activities and the things that Lee 
mentioned.

<p>
And I agree that his take on "faith" it very insightful in that faith 
includes belief, commitment and trust.  Sometimes religious belief can give 
a person the confidence to move forward and achieve goals in their life that 
ordinarily they would not have done.

<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker continues:
<br>
I personally think it is quite rational and productive to make
commitments to beliefs or courses of action without complete
evidence--otherwise nothing would ever get done.  Of course when new
evidence arrives, a rational person embraces it and discards old
misconceptions that he might previously have relied upon, but that
doesn't mean it was necessarily irrational to have relied upon them
earlier.  Let us be sure that when we bash religion, we are in fact
bashing specifically the irrational stubbornness to accept evidence
contrary to dogma and not other associated things that may or may
not be valuable.- --

I have seen on this list much bald-faced prejudice against religion and 
faith in all forms.  I realize many of you are venting being that you are 
frustrated by the views of others.  I see the possibility of either side 
being right in this debate and so I keep my eyes open.  And I enjoy the 
fellowship of my church.

By contrast I think faith is a grave character flaw.
The only apostle I like was Thomas because he doubted.

<p>
I have had similar thoughts!  Even though if Christ really did the miracles 
desccribed in the New Testament I could see how Thomas doubting would be 
seen as weakness.  I felt a bond with Thomas also because of his display of 
humanity.

I've had a close friend who was Muslim, many friends who were Wiccan, and a 
few friends who were Mormon. I'd say Islam is much, much worse then 
Christianity, primarily because most of its adherents actually believe it 
and apply it to their lives and their society. Of Mormons, there seems to be 
two types: those who have left the church and are broken by guilt for 
wanting to enjoy life, and those broken by the church who no longer want to 
enjoy life.

I have to say I think an active Mormon can still be in the church and enjoy 
life! :)  There are those who have experience doubt despite having at least 
some faith and having a desire to take part in the church.  I would be one 
of these people.  I love the church and find joy in it and yet have 
questions as I think many actually do.  I believe in God and divinely 
influenced scripture but do not have a perfect knowledge to be sure.  I am 
drawn to cryonics I suppose because I do not have perfect faith or 
knowledge.

<p>
I find myself attracted to extropianism due to the positive views regarding 
technology and the future.  I was raised on "Star Trek", science-fiction 
novels and "Cosmos" which laid a foundation I suppose to be drawn to this 
movement.  I disagree with the rejection of the supernatural but I have at 
least come to better understand another view of existance.

<p>
In terms of wanting to enjoy life, people run into problems when they desire 
sexual "freedom" meaning premarital sex or sex outside of marriage.  A 
number of youth leave over this.  And also doctrinal and historical 
controversy causes some to leave.  So there are certainly people who fit 
into those two categories you list for a variety of reasons.

<p>
I realize there are many nonbelievers on this list but I am just sharing my 
beliefs with you.  Do I know without any doubt that this is true; no I do 
not.  Mormons believe that the spirit of God lets people know the truth of 
these things for themselves through the mind and the heart but this takes 
someone being willing to do their own experiment by faith, study and 
application.  By this I have gained what I consider my belief in God and the 
afterlife.

<p>
And yet because I do not have a perfect knowledge of God I cling to this 
life that I know.  I am angry at the unfairness of mortality in terms of the 
inequality regarding intelligence, beauty, health and wealth among the 
population.  I want to see things straightened out here in this life and not 
just wait for the next.  I feel the human lifespan is just too short and 
that cryonics may give me the extra time I want.  Even as a nanobot filled 
immortal I will not go on forever; death will eventually claim me and 
uploaded copies of me as replacements holds no appeal to me.

<p>
So perhaps I hedge my bets.  It makes me feel guilty to do so but I want my 
chance in life!  I suffer from clinical depression (I take meds but no 
breakthrough yet), a.d.d. and worst of all learning disabilities that have 
stopped me so far from doing well in math and worst of all driving a car 
which is a huge frustration for me and  cost me dearly professionally and 
with women.  My father left my mother and I when I was a baby and I grew up 
without him.  I still bear emotional scars from that despite being reunited 
over the phone with him.  The damage is done and no apology has come.  He 
was extremely handsome but I did not inherit that key trait that can make 
life so much more pleasant.

<p>
I attend a local LDS singles adult ward and find it interesting that despite 
all the talk of living by Christ-like principles of love and kindness the 
same ruthless mating game rituals goes on there as anywhere else. Good-looks 
and money count just as much though being a faithful mormon guy is part of 
the bargain too.  I find the women friendlier in clubs and school dances 
then I do at the church dances.

<p>
A bishop(pastor) once explained it to me that the women are looking for 
mates so they are extremely particular.  I recently went through an online 
lds personals site and was surprised by all the women who were very 
attractive, in their thirties and never married even though certainly 
society is changing in that people wait longer to marry which is generally 
good.  I just wondered how many of these women were 'untouched' sexually 
since chastity is so emphasized in my church  (my male sexual strategies are 
showing themselves!).

<p>
It saddens me somewhat to think alot of people abstain from sex in their 
prime years(I am one who did) when they could have enjoyed their bodies and 
a partner so many times by making love over those years.  But they do this 
to live with their conscience and belief system.  I am not recommending 
promiscuity though since that can have it's own problems and heartaches.  I 
suppose the answer for me would have been marrying in my mid-twenties to 
have a partner had I been ready for one at that stage.

<p>
So many more have had it worse then me I realize but then so many more have 
had it much better.  I find myself sometimes criticized by people who are so 
blessed in comparison to me and have no right to talk.  I want a brain free 
of the flaws mine has and a handsome body on par with my fathers.  I want to 
be able to without agony learn math and to especially be able to drive a 
car.  I realize I must simply do the best with the hand of cards life dealt 
me but I tend to dwell on the negative and give up in frustration and 
embarrassment.

This post by Greg Burch commenting on what Robert Bradbury wrote really hit 
me hard as I explain below in detail.

&gt;Its fascinating to me to observe what happens in my mind when
&gt;  I enter a church.  All kinds of old feelings, beliefs, memories
&gt;  come bubbling up from the basement of my mind.  I normally
&gt;  rarely think about these things, but I have no doubt that
&gt;  many of my early beliefs (Catholic) are still part of my
&gt;  programming.  As the years go by, probably because I don't
&gt;  think about them much, the memories do seem to fade.

</pre>
<p>
The same sort of thing will happen to me from my own Catholic upbringing,
especially if I encounter the full blown "Magic Show" (as I used to call the
Mass when I was an altar boy); it's almost like some kind of weird drug 
rush.

<p>
(I attend the mormon church and though despite some doubt I do believe.  I <br>
found myself hit with a wave of powerful emotions as a young and attractive 
woman teaching a lesson on the eternal nature of the family gave her 
personal testimony that those things were true and very important to her.  I 
actually thought to myself how she was the woman I should go after and marry 
despite the fact she is only nineteen.  Later I thought how despite my 
feelings and possible courtship she would probably wind up not with me even 
after much gentle effort.  But stirring courtships are the stuff of legend 
and I have been told these by various places affecting my life.  I rushed 
out afterwards telling her how touched I was by her remarks.  Partly to 
impress her yes but also because I was.)

<p>
Interestingly, the memories don't fade for many people, but just go into a
dormant state.  I think a big part of the resurgence in religious fervor in
America now can be attributed to the reactivation of religious memes
implanted in childhood among the Boomers by life situations they're just now
encountering: Parenting and middle age career and physiological stress.  A
whole panoply of programming was implanted in them, just waiting to be
activated by these predictable events in the stages of a typical human life

<p>
(As I get older I feel a stronger and stronger tug to fully go back to my <br>
mormon roots.  I have some problems with various matters of history and 
doctrine and yet overall I love the people(my tribe) and the binding social 
concept of eternal families.  I can understand about the reactivation of 
religious memes!  We had a lesson in one class on to be honest not just 
living a balanced life but "not shaking the boat" and the indirect message 
bothered me.  I looked around wondering how many others felt the same way.  
And yet as the speaker had tears in his eyes expressing his love for us all 
and God which was throughout his lesson I felt choked up and very affected.  
And yet a part of me was detached and wondered how much of what I felt was 
truly the spirit of God and how much was simply human emotion.  I know the 
speaker was sincere in his motives at least.)

<p>
(I need so badly the love and support of my group and yet I want to still <br>
think critically.  I feel torn inside sometimes so badly you could not 
imagine.  Being around extropian memes have affected me somewhat but these 
thoughts arose before I even knew of this movement.  I have few doubts about 
the existance of God or an afterlife but human institutions can be 
troublesome even when I believe they are inspired of God.  I have heard some 
of my top church leaders; especially some of the younger ones try to address 
this issue and in some ways have done well in my view.  My church in the 
sociological perspective has evolved over the years in adapting to the 
society around it.)

<p>
(I have studied in college the sociology of religion and can see things in <br>
that context.  And even then I see how at least for some like myself 
belonging to their religious group is so important.  It is an extended 
family that can nurture and provide in so many ways.  I do not feel a 
hypocrite for wanting to stay in my church for I do believe in it overall 
despite some misgivings.)

<p>
(I have not yet signed for cryonic suspension but probably will down the <br>
road.  Even with belief in an afterlife this is what I know right here and I 
did not get the life I wanted though many people could say the same.  
Clinical depression, a.d.d., and learning disabilities along with poverty 
and an absent father did not make for the life I wanted.  My learning 
disabilities have so far even stopped me from getting a driver's license to 
my great shame.  My local voc rehab is not even willing to help me to the 
extent I need to get a license.)

<p>
(I know there is much here and now I can do to improve things and yet I want <br>
to see "over the horizon" and partake of the wonderful future we may have.  
But the human lifespan is just too short so cryonics will get me where I 
want to go.  Some have said I am hedging my bets and I suppose I am.  If the 
fundamentalist view of Bibical prophecy is correct though we are all in for 
it!!  My suspended body would not last through all of that!  The singularity 
will come in the form of an armageddon with the very technologies we 
discuss; but time will tell.)

<p>
(I suppose if I felt my "needs were met" I would not post here.  I feel <br>
somewhat ashamed admitting my doubt and torment.  Much of it stems from not 
having a mate and so not being "happily locked into" my faith.  Perhaps I 
should not have posted this but I felt the need.  I want to look back a 
hundred years from now and have a feeling of contentment that I made it 
through my youthful trials in one form or another.  I thank you all for 
bearing with me.)

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
