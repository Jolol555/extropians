<a name="1969qlink1">There are two highly visible centers of significant activity relating to 
nanotech in Texas so far - at least based on my research and communication 
I've had with folks here and at Foresight on the Left Coast.  The first I 
would list is, of course, Zyvex, in Richardson, Texas (just northeast of 
Dallas):

<p>
  <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/">http://www.zyvex.com/</a>

<p>
The big news at Zyvex is Ralph Merkle's new association with the company.  
I'll be seeing Ralph up at Zyvex next weekend.

<p>
The other visibly active center is at Rice University's Center</a> for Nanoscale 
<a name="1969qlink2">Science and Technology in Houston, where Nobel laureate Richard</a> Smalley works:

<p>
<a name="1969qlink3">   <a href="http://cnst.rice.edu/">http://cnst.rice.edu/</a>

<p>
(Isn't there always some basic rivalry between Dallas and Houston?)

<p>
Finally, there seems to be SOME kind of activity down at JSC (just south of 
Houston).  There's a company that's hung out a cyber-shingle there called 
"Nanotechnology Development Company":

<p>
   <a href="http://nanozine.com/Invest-NanoTech.htm">http://nanozine.com/Invest-NanoTech.htm</a>

<p>
and a discussion group in the Clear Lake area (whose web site I can't</a> seem to 
<a name="1969qlink4">find this morning).  However, after some publicity about "NDC" last year, 
I've seen no activity out of them and didn't get a response to an e-mail I 
sent to the Clear Lake group in the Spring.  It seems the real center of 
NASA's interest and activity in nanotech is at Ames in Palo Alto.

<p>
Hope this helps.
