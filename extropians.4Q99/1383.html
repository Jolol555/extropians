<p>
It is a speculative possibility, based on the ideas of false vacua. In
the older models of inflation the universe got stuck in a "metastable
false vacuum state", an unstable phase of the vacuum with nonzero
energy density. During this period inflation occured and the universe
expanded tremendously, but eventually the false vacuum decayed into a
real vacuum, slowing the expansion and releasing a lot of energy. More
modern models do not have a metastable false vacuum but rather a flat
potential for the vacuum state (like x^4-x^2 near zero), but the
principle is similar ( see <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hawking/open.html">http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hawking/open.html</a> 
for a talk by Hawking on inflation).

<a name="1392qlink2">But what if the universe is not in a true vacuum state but a false
vacuum? Then the vacuum could randomly decay one day, releasing its
</a>
energy and likely making the fields defining particle masses and
properties change. The decay would spread with the speed of light, and
our world would be utterly wrecked. A bit like when you change the
rules of a Cellular Automaton when a simulation is running. 

<p>
<a name="1392qlink3">It is not a very likely danger (if it could happen with a high
probability it would have happened by now), but it is one of those
</a>
boojums in cosmology to keep one awake in the middle of the night.
