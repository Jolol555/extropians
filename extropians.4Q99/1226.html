oops I posted my nanoslinky notion before I read this.  Disregard
previous!  As for Nanomedicine, I preordered a copy from Amazon
the very first time you suggested it, before the better sites were
proposed, last July I think, and they promised it in October.  Well
October is almost over, and Ive been salivating for it ever since,
and no Nanomedicine.  I met Dr. Frietas at the Nanotech conference
in Santa Clara, and even managed to say something other than:
hammina hammina hammina Im unwoooooorthy!  I suuuck!

<p>
Niced guy you ever saw!  Humble, just as plain as tap water.
(What is it about these nanotech gods?  K. Eric is like that too.
They go around acting like normal people!  {8^D )  He even
let me look at a copy of his book, but the local Borders has
none in stock.  I was thinking of running over to Stanford this
morning but I doubt they have any copies left.
