Now I think we need to quibble over what is science and what is technology, I 
believe the two are closely related buy not identical.  Technology is 
essentially the making of new things, Science might be the discovery and 
measurement of things old and new. Fire-making, therefore, would be the 
domain of the "tech" and yes maybe even one of your  "priests/priestesses".  

<p>
However, taking your interpretation to it logical conclusion, then the 
"scientists" who developed the torture/murder implements of the  Inquisition 
or the Witch Hunts would then be condemned by both of us for their enabling 
of "evil".  I mean the Pear took some handi-work to create, as did the Rack 
and Iron Maiden. Lets look to Haber's development of chlorene and phosgene 
gases during WW1 for the Kaiser's army. Haber was a Nobel prize winner also.

<p>
What we really come to is not a separation of people into God and Atheist 
camps; but a more natural division of those religious and science-minded 
people who are 
<br>
Ethical--and those who believe that all ends justify all means.
