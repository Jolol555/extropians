&lt;&lt; 2 points:<br>
 
<p>
  1.) Having certain restrictions might be a spur to
 the AI to find alternative harmelss solutions to a
 problem;&gt;&gt;

<p>
I would say that restrictions might prevent an AI from implementing obvious 
harmful solutions to a problem, though as well as channelling them to 
harmless solutions it may also send them toward less obvious harmful ones.  
Nothing is perfect (yet).
 
<p>
 &lt;&lt; 2.) The freedom of the AI to develop must be balanced
 with the possible effects on humans. Speaking
 selfishly, I'd plump for the latter party.

<p>
I'd say that the freedom of any AI must be balanced against the possible 
effects on any sentient, human or AI, just as a human's freedom must be 
balanced against the same possibility of causing harm.  I just hope that with 
designed intelligences we can do a better job of instilling a respect for 
others than we tend to do now.
