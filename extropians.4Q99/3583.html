Oops.  It would appear that I've also got "The Nature of Heuristics II",
<br>
"The Nature of Heuristics III", and "Why AM and Eurisko appear to work"<br>
in the same package.

<p>
Which goes back to another point I was planning to make.  I'm very
grateful for the flood of suggestions and offers, but first I have to
finish reading the articles I have now.  It could be that they'll tell
me everything I need to know about EURISKO, in which case, I might not
even need the source code.

<p>
Anyway, thanks for all the offers, public and private.  It looks like I
should definitely be able to get ahold of at least a paper copy of the
source code, if that's still necessary when I'm finished reading. 
Thanks also for all the suggestions.  Once again, I am reminded that the
heuristic "Stay on the Extropians list" has high utility over a wide domain.

<p>
Yours in Singularity,
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky.
