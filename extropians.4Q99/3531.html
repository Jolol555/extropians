<a href="3406.html#3531qlink1">&gt; &gt; By aborting one single human, the number of innocent animals that</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would go undevoured as a direct result would be difficult to even</i><br>
<i>&gt; estimate...spike</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Robert J. Bradbury] probably could estimate it fairly accurately and on</i><br>
<i>&gt; a day when I'm really ambitious, I'll probably attempt that</i><br>
<i>&gt; (since its such a JUICY idea)...</i><br>

<p>
Ok, I was suffering from an attack of laziness.  If one figures in
the number of vegetarians, the number of Hindus (who eat no
beef), Jews (who eat no pork) etc, I estimate the average human
in his or her lifetime will devour the following numbers of animals:

<p>
40 steers
<br>
50 swine
<br>
100 turkeys
<br>
1000 chickens
<br>
2000 fish
<br>
1E4 shrimp
<br>
2E4 insects (bugs in the wheatfields are ground into the flour, etc)
1E18 bacteria and other single celled fauna

<p>
All these would go undevoured, should a single human go unborn.
The number of wild animals who are without a habitat, owing to
the agricultural land needed to produce all these cattle, hoggage,
etc, would perhaps double the number of animals which must
perish for one of us great apes.

<p>
On the other hand, the excrement of a single human provides
nutrients for countless microorganisms at the waste treatment
plant, so perhaps we are not such a bad deal after all.  spike
