WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Friends of the Earth (FoE), 
the Organic Consumers Association, and concerned farmers and citizens 
rallied today outside a Safeway store in the nation's capital calling 
for the supermarket chain to go "genetically engineered (GE) free" in 
its store brand of products. 

<p>
FoE noted that genetically engineered ingredients are present in 
approximately 60 percent to 70 percent of all processed foods lining 
our supermarket shelves, including baby formula, corn chips, veggie 
burgers, frozen meals and ice cream. They also called attention to 
the numerous health risks associated with GE foods: the threat that 
new allergens and toxins could be introduced into our food supply; 
and the possibility that GE foods could cause increased resistance to 
antibiotics. Environmental threats like the toxic effects on Monarch 
butterflies are also a concern. 

<p>
"These foods are not safety tested by the FDA before they go onto 
the market, and they are not labeled, " said Friends of the Earth 
President Dr. Brent Blackwelder. "Consumers are being used as guinea 
pigs and are being denied the right to make informed choices about 
the food they eat and feed their families." 

<p>
The group will hold its next rally in Seattle during the WTO 
meetings on Thursday, Dec. 2. For more information, contact FoE in 
Seattle at 206-448-9444 or 206-953-0347 (cell).
