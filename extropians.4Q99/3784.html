<a name="3811qlink1">This question came up when Ralph Merkle discussed Cryonics at the A4M.
Someone asked the thorny question of what happens to the spirit of the
individual when s/he is frozen &amp; reanimated.  Ralph pointed out with
his usual skill that as a scientist he couldn't answer this question
but it was clear that the people who as embryos were frozen, thawed
and then implanted, that their spirit was doing just fine.

The only way to deal with this is to differentiate "Mind" from "body".
In that area, the December Scientific American has an interesting
discussion on scientists unraveling both the "Movie in the mind"
and the "Observer of the Movie" that seem to make up the essence
of the "spirit" argument.
