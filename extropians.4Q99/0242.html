<a name="0245qlink1">I believe that Elizabeth has hit the nail on the head.

<p>
Academics are trained to survive and prosper in one environment,
corporate types in another.  The corporate types are always
questioning whether that information has value while the academic
types are questioning whether the information has relevance.
[maybe, I could easily see this statement reversed...]</a>

<p>
One of my former managers had a PhD, IMO he was a turkey.
After about 10 years elapsed, Fortune said essentially the
same thing.  In business it comes down to whether or not
you can spend the investment and produce the desired result.
If you can and you don't manage to do it you are crop dust.
If you can't and accept a position claiming you can you
get a similar fate.  There is only one way out -- to see
what is really possible and do it.

<p>
In a corporate environment a PhD does little or nothing in
determining whether or not you can recruit &amp; manage people
so as to produce a bug-free and market successful product.

<p>
Much more important in any field is whether you can command
the respect of your peers.  In academics, this tends to be
determined by papers that have passed through peer review.
In programming this tends to be determined by lines of code
that are bug free (or perhaps efficient or clever in some way).

<p>
With regard to judging capabilities, I always look at
experience and examples.  Robin's papers are well reasoned and
never shortcut the math so I am always going to respect them.
If I find fault it is going to be in the underlying assumptions
and not the reasoning based on those assumptions.

<p>
Similarly for the future Drs. Sandberg, Graps and McKendrick
I will have a high respect for the work that they have gone
through to reach their perspective or conclusions.  [Though
<a name="0300qlink1">IMO the time involved in Amara's efforts may have been
excessive.  I'm unsure whether this is by her choice or
the system she is enmeshed</a> in.]

<p>
Generally, I would fall into the camp Robin supports of
peer review and publication record.  But there are clearly
environments where those values are irrelevant, such as
business success or efficiency in programs.  I don't
believe at this time we have adequate means of translating
success or knowledge in one "world" (academics, business,
programming, art) into one of the other realms.

<p>
I think most of us value those areas where we can accurately
assess the degree of difficulty.  I know to a much greater
extent the difficulty in writing a very efficient computer
program than I do writing a successful academic paper.
However, for me to propose that writing a successful computer
program is harder than writing a successful research paper
does seem naive.
