[I've appended an edited list of topic headings from their search 
page, for your immediate amusement... and I wasn't able to find any 
hits under nuclear rocketry or nuclear weapons... odd :-)... what an 
amazing country we live in! -- Rohit]

DoD offers some 100,000 of its military docs at:

<p>
   <a href="http://assist.daps.mil">http://assist.daps.mil</a>

<p>
Go to Quick Search and drop down the FSC/Area menu
for dozens of categories from nukes to explosives
to communications security to whatever death-tech
pork allures.

<p>
Docs there we've been looking for a couple of
years, though in huge multi-MB PDF files. We were
pleased to find much TEMPEST info in docs there,
some NSA refused to release under FOIA. None of
the docs are classified.

<p>
There is buried in several of the docs a specification
from NSA 65-6 on TEMPEST protection levels, charts,
details on exactly how to do it, or do it back when the
docs were prepared*.

<p>
Having spent many hours downloading, we might,
only might, put together a CD on mil-grade TEMPEST
protection. Now that there is far better ways to get
around EMSEC through human persuasion.

<p>
Maybe the site will become restricted at some point
(only a few of the docs require a pwd). For now it's a
good source to build your digital library.
