<p>
Most humans filter their sense data through several layers of brain circuits
into brain data, using both verbalization and emotionalization of the data
as equivalent to the original sense data.

<p>
Your term ``qualia'' appears to point at the original sense data, as opposed
to the manipulated brain data derived from such sense data.

<p>
E.g. the sense data from the eye units which, among other data, contain data
on the wave length of the photons detected, would be converted into instances
of the concept ``red'' when the received data correspond to certain wave
lengths, as defined by previously stored memory information on eye sense data
transformation learned by the human at an early age.

<p>
I have encountered states without verbalization and concepts like ``red''
disappeared in a puff of logic.  I did not see ``red'' but zillions of
colours, all different. The sense data from the eye units did not change,
however; only the interpretation of the sense data.

<p>
I would argue that if one accepts that the sense data actually comes from
a world outside one's own mind, then one would become compelled to accept
the sense data as real.

<p>
So the question ``boils down'' to what you mean when you use the words
"subjective experience of red".

<p>
Do you mean

<pre>
   (a)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms
	define the wave length part of the data as instances of a concept
	which I call "red", being a subconcept of the concept "colour".
	I identify the resulting verbal brain data as my "subjective
	experience of red".'', 

   (b)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms
	define the wave length part of the data as instances of a concept
	which I call "red", being a subconcept of the concept "colour".
	I identify the corresponding emotional brain data as my "subjective
	experience of red".'', 

   (c)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms
	define the wave length part of the data as instances of a concept
	which I call "red", being a subconcept of the concept "colour".
	My associate memory units access the resulting verbal brain data
	and I identify the resulting verbal brain data as my "subjective
	experience of red".'', 

   (d)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms
	define the wave length part of the data as instances of a concept
	which I call "red", being a subconcept of the concept "colour".
	My associate memory units access the resulting emotional brain data
	and I identify the resulting emotional brain data as my "subjective
	experience of red".'', 

   (e)	``I experience these eye sense data, and my decision algorithms
	define the wave length part of the data as instances of a concept
	which I call "red", being a subconcept of the concept "colour".
	I identify these sense data as my "subjective experience of red".'', 
</pre>
   or

<p>
   (f)	something else?


<p>
Personally, I use the (a) definition in my communication protocols.
