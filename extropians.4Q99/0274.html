<a name="0280qlink1"><a name="0278qlink1"><a name="0277qlink1">The most astounding fact I picked up in my conversations with Dr Jack Cohen
(and then half lost, having no search facilities with me and not even a
notebook, so what follows is garbled and unreliable) is that Dolly came
from a batch of attempts in which Dr Wilmut tried to insert the telomerase
gene into the clones. Amazingly, all those embryos which incorporated
telomerase failed; Dolly's genome, however, proved *not* to have taken up
the gene.</a></a> 

<p>
I was agog at this. Cohen had got it from conversation with Wilmut, I
believe, although he said it had been published a few months ago in some
relatively obscure place. (I must be making that bit up - how could
anything Wilmut has to say about Dolly end up somewhere obscure?)

<p>
<a name="0280qlink2"><a name="0278qlink2">Anyway, this is all rather startling if correct. Might put a crimp in our
plans for Immortality Next Week.</a></a>

<p>
Anyone with better net searching abilities than me should feel encouraged
to post more details.
