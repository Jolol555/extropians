Well Hal, the problem is that you have people in the loop rather than
just machines.  I can't offer you pictures of the weather on Mars
but I can offer you pictures of another very interesting spot.  Try:
  <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">http://www.washington.edu/</a>

<p>
The image is rarely more than a few minutes out of date and on those
very rare clear days you can see a very large volcano.  I realize that it
isn't quite as big as Olympus Mons, but what can I do on a planet
that has water erosion to contend with.

<p>
Sorry I can offer you more, but I don't do miracles until someone forks
over the nanoassembler controls.

<p>
R.
