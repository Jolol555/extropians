I'd strongly question this.<a name="3347qlink1">  If they are taking an example out of the
GRAPE book, they are designing the instructions for molecular modeling.</a>
As Eugene points out, when you get down to the quantum level there may
still be problems with our shortcuts on the math or the granularity of
current simulations.  Molecular modeling (like galactic gravity calculations)
aren't tremendously complicated, but the propagation of the effects
through all of the data elements requires a very good architecture.

<p>
If you're an atom and I'm an atom, then I can push you, pull you or
side-step you.  Its a little more complicated due to the multiple
types of pull (ionic, covalent, etc.) I can exert on you but it
doesn't require a lot of instructions.  It just requires that
those instructions be very efficient and very accurate.  From
the sounds of it the additional instructions are going to get
used for stuff like really high levels of multi-threading (they
seem to be taking a page out of Tera's book here, since Tera
is the first architecture I know of thats designed to thread
switch in every instruction), and perhaps dealing with some
of the fault tolerance stuff.  You probably need the thread
switching to allow you to keep doing something while waiting
for information from off-chip CPUs.<a name="3347qlink2">  They may have sat back after
doing the molecular modeling stuff and said, ok, now how can
we turn the machine into a good data-mining computer, or a
good speech recognition processor, or a good image processor
and added some more instructions to round things out.</a>

<p>
I don't think they took a R-RISC approach at all, but time will tell.
I'd agree that there isn't any microcode in this, all the instructions
should be done in hardware.
