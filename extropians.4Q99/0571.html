I find it interesting that no one seems to have focused - except for M. 
Yudowsky, as I now recall - on the need for accurate information.  If you 
are interested in the truth, you don't censor.  Do you WANT people - humans 
or uploads - to conceal who they are?  Is hypocrisy to be a virtue - as it 
is in most Eastern cultures, where treachery is an art form?
What about emotional interaction?  We perceive ourselves, in the most 
fundamental sense (see N. Branden's work on this) through the uncensored 
reactions of other people.  Are we so weak and have such a minus level 
self-esteem that we have to force other people to react the way that we 
want?
<br>
I had an experience with some dogs once.  These dogs roamed the neighborhood 
at night and I frequently saw them, but they never approached.  On night I 
was sitting on the doorstep and thinking that I would like to interact with 
one of the dogs physically.  So, how could I get them to come to me?  
Calling them or whistling was either ignored or caused them to move away.
So, suddenly I remembered Branden's experience with his dog that led him to 
his breakthrough in the need and nature of emotional interaction.  I 
thought, the dogs want the same thing I do, but they are much more on the 
perceptual level.  So what is it that they are seeing or not seeing in me 
that they don't like?
<br>
Then I realized that I was suppressing my fear of dogs in trying to entice 
them - not that I'm terrified of dogs, by any means, but there is a fear 
component which is quite rational.  My voice, smell, whatever, was telling 
them that I was trying to put something over on them.  So I consciously told 
myself, focus on the fear.  Feel the fear.  Don't try to pretend anything.  
Now call them.
<br>
They came right up to me and were all over me in a matter of seconds. I 
later tested this on several occasions and, invariably, if I tried to put on 
some emotional pretence, the dogs would back off.
On the other hand, I had a series of correspondences with Rosalie Nichols, 
briefly famous for her "open letter to Ayn Rand" in which she attacked 
Rand's positions on gays and anarchists.  Rosalie later published and edited 
"Lesbian Voices."  One issue featured her discussion of all the virtues of 
women.  She listed this long string of standard Randian/Aristotelian virtues 
- productivity, rationality, etc.  However, there were several major ones 
not on the list.  All the ones not on her list were those having to do with 
honesty, integrity, ect.  ...
<br>
Most women are taught by the media if not their mothers very early on that 
the way to succeed is by manipulating people, especially men re sex and 
marriage, but also in general.  This has become a virtually insurmountable 
barrier to having good relationships - intellectual or emotional and often 
economic - with a high percentage of them, more so perhaps in the U.S. than 
anywhere else.

<a name="0575qlink1">I would certainly fear to be part of an upload culture in which people had 
the power to cut me off just because I spoke unpopular truthes as I saw 
</a>them.  I see THAT and how to prevent it as a far more appropriate focus than 
trying to teach people to be PC so that they won't someday be erased by 
other irate uploads.
