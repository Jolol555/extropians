Just as I twisted the thread, James Rogers gave it another twist and wrote:

<p>
Interesting.  I have an opposite viewpoint.

<p>
One of my reasons for seeking a vastly increased lifespan is to try all the
things I'm currently interested in, that are currently available activities,
that I couldn't do without a few more centuries.  Like travelling to every
country, learning to pick locks, becoming a doctor, or piloting a hot air
balloon.

<p>
There are other current activities that are not options for me -- going 
through pregnancy, growing up in Nepal, being a dolphin, becoming Pope.

<p>
There are current activities that are possible, but that I'd prefer not to
try -- being an inmate on death row, working on a bomb-disposal unit, running 
for Congress.

<p>
There are past activities that are no longer possible -- being a foot soldier 
in WW I, seeing the court of Henry VIII, or discovering the structure of DNA.

<p>
There are countless future activities that are not yet possible.

<p>
My life is focussed on those activities that are currently possible and are
of highest value to me.  But I retain an interest in all those other things,
choose to devote some fraction of my time to experiencing them vicariously -- 
through reading, watching, and listening -- and consider the time well-spent.
