<a href="0661.html#1701qlink1">&gt; From: M. E. Smith &lt;mesmith@rocketmail.com&gt;</a><br>

<p>
<a href="1686.html#1701qlink2">&gt; Obviously, I am not the only one who is</a><br>
<i>&gt; frusted by those who seem to equate all</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious thought with fundamental</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christianity. Aarrgh! What century do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you think this is?</i><br>

<p>
Almost the 21st, and religious fundamentalism is still
quite common in many parts of the world. Aarrgh! indeed.
 
<p>
<a href="1686.html#1701qlink3">&gt; We all know that there is no "God" in the</a><br>
<i>&gt; sense of some huge all-powerful man with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; beard who created us and gets upset when</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have sex for any other reason than</i><br>
<i>&gt; procreation. Among intelligent people, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably includes anyone on this list, these</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments have been won a long time ago. As</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nietzche said; that God is dead.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1705qlink1">He may be dead to us, but to many others he's alive and kickin'.</a>
 
<p>
<a href="1686.html#1701qlink4">&gt; The "God" that is harder to vanquish is the</a><br>
<i>&gt; ineffable one that the mystics talk about, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; one that is defined as undefinable. This "God"</i><br>
<i>&gt; will never be disproven, for the same reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a child can always say "Why?" to</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever explanation you give him. Like</i><br>
<i>&gt; "infinity", this "God" is a symbol and a useful</i><br>
<i>&gt; meme. To get upset when this symbol is used</i><br>
<i>&gt; is like getting upset when someone says</i><br>
<i>&gt; "infinity". </i><br>

<p>
<a name="1738qlink1"><a name="1705qlink2">No, "god" can't be compared to a relatively neutral
meme like "infinity"; it is firmly (and IMHO duly) 
linked to things like ignorance, irrationality and 
oppression. It's a meme that carries a lot of (often 
unpleasant) historical baggage. That's why atheists 
get upset when you use</a> it.
</a>

<p>
<a href="1686.html#1701qlink5">&gt; If you're so lacking in a poetic sense</a><br>
<i>&gt; that you cannot appreciate this "God", that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; no reason to verbally abuse those that do.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1705qlink3">The undefinable is the undefinable, the universe is 
the universe, infinity is infinity. Using the term 
"God" to describe any or all of these things is 
simply not very practical.</a> 

<p>
<a href="1686.html#1701qlink6">&gt; Would you insult Douglas Hofstadter when</a><br>
<i>&gt; he uses the word "God" in this sense?</i><br>

<p>
Not openly, but I'd certainly respect him less for
it. 
 
<p>
<a href="1686.html#1701qlink7">&gt; I don't find it hard to imagine an advanced SI</a><br>
<i>&gt; with a brain the size of a planet thinking,</i><br>
<i>&gt; analyzing, constructing and testing mental</i><br>
<i>&gt; models, expending the energies of whole stars,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for countless terateraflops, trying to understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; the universe, why it's here, and ultimately giving</i><br>
<i>&gt; up, realizing it'll never know, and at that moment</i><br>
<i>&gt; feeling a great awe.</i><br>

<p>
....or frustration. Personally, I don't think a SI would
*ever* give up completely, though it may give the search 
for absolute understanding of everything an increasingly 
lower priority.
