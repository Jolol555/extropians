<a name="3419qlink1"><a href="3299.html#3411qlink1">&gt;I don't understand why this list is full of "hypotheses" that are propagated</a><br>
<i>&gt;without the most basic fact checking.  Why not just look up the composition</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Ritalin to see if its identity is identical to amphetamine?</i><br>

<p>
You want unexamined hypotheses.  Once, long ago, on alt.tv.twin-peaks
someone relayed a speculation that certain procedural tricks were played
with the name<a name="3428qlink1"> of the character known as "Windom Earle".</a>  The poster said
that he had heard that some string of letters (which he quoted) was an
anagram of this name.  The question he so desperately asked: could someone
please tell him whether or not the anagram rumor is true?</a>

<p>
Needless to say this was more than boggling.
