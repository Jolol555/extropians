*FEED magazine has an article on nanotechnology. "Thinking Small." Mark<br>
Pesce (co-inventor of VRML) on molecular-scale manufacturing, the gray goo
problem, and how nanotechnology will change the world as we know it.

*Ultra-tiny machines are becoming big hope for scientists. After years of<br>
preliminary research, hope and hype, business and industry are starting to
enter the strange, invisible world of the very ... Very ... VERY
small.Government agencies, leading universities and major corporations are
rapidly expanding their efforts to design and build machines and structures
on the scale of atoms and molecules. This exploding new discipline -- known
as ``nanotechnology'' -- has become a top scientific priority in Congress
and at the White House.

*Plastic Pillars of the Microworld. Rome wasn't built in a day, but a<br>
nanosized version of it may be thrown up that quickly in the near future. At
the International Symposium on Cluster and Nanostructure Interfaces here
last week, researchers described a new technique capable of creating arrays
of plastic pillars, each less than a micrometer across, that resemble
nothing so much as tiny versions of the great columns of Rome's coliseum.

*It's a small, kinky world. Tiny, bent tubes of carbon might be used both to<br>
wire up and to construct DNA-scale electrical devices.

*Yale Research Team First to Describe Molecular-Sized Memory -- Discovery<br>
has Implications for Drastically Reducing Cost of Computer Memory. omputer
storage capacity can be vastly increased using a molecular memory based on a
single molecule, a research team from Yale and Rice Universities has
discovered.

*A miniaturized triode could instead replace the transistor as the switch of<br>
information technologies. Driskill-Smith and colleagues have now fabricated
a ‘nanotriode’ tube measuring less than 100 nanometres (millionths of a
millimetre) in any direction.

*Making Robots Microscopic but Mighty. Michael J. Marsella is dreaming small<br>
these days. The assistant professor of chemistry at UC Riverside is trying
to create artificial "muscles" no bigger than a single molecule.

<p>
*Chemical researchers build molecular computer. A molecular electronics<br>
research project at Mitre Corp. has achieved a milestone in the effort to
build self-assembled molecular computers. Researchers James Ellenbogen and
Christopher Love have invented chemical building blocks that support the
operation of a digital half adder, which represents a new level of circuit
complexity for the field.

*How Biological Molecules Move Electrons: Simplicity Trumps Complexity. In a<br>
sweeping new study, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Medical
Center have shown that the natural engineering principles governing electron
transfer within proteins are significantly less complex than has been the
prevailing view.

*Crack open an egg and cure a disease. Two American companies are planning a<br>
pilot test of drugs in eggs laid by genetically engineered chickens. The
birds carry genes that make their eggs contain proteins that can treat
disease. These proteins are then passed on to future generations of chickens
without the need to repeat the injection.

*Improved biodegradable hydrogels. Two novel biodegradable hydrogels<br>
developed by a Cornell University fiber scientists have potential
applications for controlling and delivering many kinds of medications inside
and outside the body, for anchoring biological substances such as skin and
vascular tissues and may even be used to introduce viruses to the body for
gene therapy.

*UNC-CH Physicists Find Atoms Of Chilled Metallic Liquids Chiefly Move In<br>
Lockstep
<br>
CHAPEL HILL - For the first time, atomic-scale measurements have revealed
that atoms in a metallic liquid cooled significantly below the melting
point - also known as a super-cooled liquid -- chiefly move together in
clustered lockstep.

*Novel neurotransmitter overturns laws of biology, offers potential for<br>
stroke treatment. Johns Hopkins scientists have identified a new and unusual
nerve transmitter in the brain, one that overturns certain long-cherished
laws about how nerve cells behave.

*Memory uses separate information pathways. The memory has separate pathways<br>
for different types of information. This has been demonstrated by means of
anatomical and electrical measurements of the hippocampus and the adjacent
cerebral cortex of laboratory rats. The signal pathways ultimately meet in
the so-called subiculum of the brain, from which information from the
hippocampus is passed on to other areas of the brain.

perfected a new-age combustion technology, which is poised to clean up
greenhouse gas emissions, slash energy costs and significantly boost

practical option for everyday use,"

*Gene Skews Inheritance Patterns. Mouse geneticists have known for decades<br>
that, contrary to the laws of Mendelian genetics, one member of certain
chromosome pairs may be passed to the next generation more often than the
other member. Now scientists have fingered the gene responsible for giving
some mouse chromosomes their advantage.

*Irish Times Opinion. "Unseen power of simple microbe." The most common<br>
image evoked by the term micro-organism(microbe) is likely to be that of
"germs", i.e. disease-causing microbes. Some micro-organisms do cause human
disease but to think of this entire class of biological organisms in this
manner is to grossly underestimate its importance and role.
