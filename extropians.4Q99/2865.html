(Example: here in the UK, this sort of protest group would have been
represented within the fringe groupings of the Labour Party until about
a decade ago. But now the Labour Party is firmly in power, in step with
the other dominant political party -- and it's mutated into just another 
bunch of middle-aged yuppie-lawyer types in suits who have to consult
a PR factory before they can fart in public.)

<p>
The wheel of reincarnation turns and we're seeing mew types of coalition
forming to represent their members' aspirations for publicity or protest.

<p>
The danger here is that because these interests are largely excluded
from the usual political discourse, they will increasingly turn towards
violent protest as a way of getting the system to respond -- however
inappropriately -- to their concerns. While we don't agree with technoluddism,
 I think it'd be better for everyone if we could exchange
verbal opinions rather than letter bombs and tear gas grenades.
