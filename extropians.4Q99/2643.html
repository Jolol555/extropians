<a name="2649qlink1">Ok, I give up.  I've seen the term "qualia" off and on over a few months
but only manage to get a vague impression of its meaning from context.
I'm not entirely "illiterate" in this area.  I've read Calvin and
</a>
Crick and Minsky and some early Churchland and I've never seen it defined.
The term isn't on Anders' 'Q' page and Amazon turns up only one title on
Consciousness and Qualia, which I've added to my Book order list
but given the backlog, I expect it will get to the top of the pile
around 2007.  It isn't in Webster's Dictionary of the English Language
or two dictionaries I have on mathematical terms or a dictionary on
molecular biology (which does however define quadrupole mass spectrometer,
Quaking mutation, quantasome, quantiles and lots of other words
that one clearly needs for Scrabble) or even "The Dictionary of
Cultural Literacy"!

<p>
Altavista lists 4600+ references, including "Qualia Computing" which
supplies "powerful computer-aided detection system designed to assist the
radiologist in the screening of breast cancer", which I suspect isn't
what is being discussed.

<p>
So, I've got two questions.

<p>
<a name="2647qlink1"><a name="2645qlink1">What in the blazes is a "qualia"?
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="2647qlink2">And, how can we lower the barriers to entry for people coming into
this list if we do not have a dictionary of terms for the newbies
(or even the middle-aged-bies)?
</a>

<p>
While Anders list is wonderful, many people probably do not know
about it and there isn't a systematic approach to expanding it
or linking our conversations to it.

<p>
Suggestion:
<br>
  We take N months of EI/transhumanist list archives, throw out
  all of the common (dictionary?) terms, reduce the list to
  an extropian/transhumanist "specific" subset, then partition
  those out to people by area of expertise.

<p>
If we get 100 people who agree to do 5-10 terms each, then we
have the basis for a background vocabulary that we can automatically
link to from the archives.

<p>
<a name="2804qlink1">Now the interesting thing about this is that, if one has been
following the discussions about types of nodes on the net
there are "destination" (termination) pages and central
"expert" pages (the terms typically used vary), but if we
presume that there will be a high targeting rate for the
"expert" pages as search engines learn to discriminate
these, then it makes sense for us to define
  <a href="http://www.extropy.org/Dictionary/term.html">http://www.extropy.org/Dictionary/term.html</a>
with definitions and lots of outgoing links to related
pages that support our perspective.
</a>

<p>
Any takers?
