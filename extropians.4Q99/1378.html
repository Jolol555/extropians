<a name="1409qlink1"><i>&gt; [Micah Redding noted] that the apostle Paul had a quite</i><br>
<a href="1349.html#1378qlink1">&gt; different attitude than what is called "faith" on this list. he</a><br>
<i>&gt; encouraged people to "test all things..."</i><br>

<p>
Which to me, is evidence that Paul did not write Hebrews,
which in chapter 11 verse 1 says "Faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."

<p>
Religion and science can play together if they follow these rules:

<p>
Religion is to speculate *only* on that which in principal
*cannot* be tested directly or indirectly.

<p>
Science is to speculate *only* on those things which
*can* be tested experimentally, even theoretically.

wrote a good book about this, called Rocks of Ages.  spike
