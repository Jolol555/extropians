<a name="3810qlink1">It would seem that we have a ways to go before attempting this.  We not
only need the 3D shapes, we need to know the chemical affinities of
each portion, and the mechanical properties.  As a trivial first step,
we'd need to know exactly how ribosomes perform protein synthesis.
Very little is known about this at the mechanochemical level.  They only
obtained a detailed 3D map of the ribosome within the past few months.
It appears that it may be something of a clockwork mechanism, with
internal moving parts.  I can't wait until we can really understand this
molecular machine in detail.</a>

<p>
One of Gina's forwarded articles described similar progress in the DNA
transcription complex, which forms messenger RNA from DNA.  They have
a pretty detailed 3D shape now, not quite at the atomic level yet.
It also offers tantalizing hints of machine-like structure.

<p>
Then there is the whole process of construction of these devices, via
self-assembly or perhaps by simpler specialized structures.  Simulating
the self-assembly of 40-odd proteins and RNA particles into a working
ribosome will be a real breakthrough.

<p>
<a name="3810qlink2">As we learn more about these protein machines I think this will add
further interest in the prospects for nanotech.  If proteins are just
enzymes, with specially-shaped active sites, that is old-fashioned
chemistry.  But if they are mechanical devices, Drexler's gears and
cables don't look so outlandish.
