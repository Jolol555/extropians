Ok, the point is raised, you don't want to call your "local"
computer/operator just after midnight.  However that says nothing
about initiating a call 10 minutes before "local" midnight and
hanging onto it for 20 minutes.  What is needed is a hub
to manage the traffic.

<p>
Dial-tone is your local carrier problem.  It says nothing about
the world-net capacity.  I have seen nothing that makes me believe
that at midnight or shortly thereafter, calls will be terminated.
Phone companies don't terminate calls -- they are making money
off of them.

<p>
<a name="3598qlink1">Natasha is right, we need a schedule -- who will call whom
who is willing to talk to the collective "whoms" at specific
timepoints (if you don't have a cell-phone, get one, I can't
think of anything other than a life threatening emergency that
would justify it more).</a>  You want to be in it for the whole
cycle.  I'll admit 24 calls in 24 hours might get tedious, but
every four hours or so and it could be a blast.  That being the case,
I think we have to lean on Damien (or another gregarious Aussie
[do they even come in non gregarious forms?] to start it off...

<p>
<a name="3598qlink2">(Of course we also want a failsafe or two to deal with the
problem that people get lost due to circmstances beyond
their control and we start clammoring that the world is ending....)


<p>
Damien.... Damien, can you hear me?... DAMIEN ARE YOU THERE?...

<p>
Oh, Eb tvoyu mat', hello, can anyone hear me...

<p>
Robert, this is John, we still hear you fine here, but we
seem to have lost LA.

<p>
Anders here, *REALLY*, you mean to say that we might have
really *lost* LA!?! ... "ODIN", oh god of gods, let me never
doubt you again for granting my wishes that that Luddite
Creation Zone be sucked up into the tar pits.  Natasha
and Max, if you can still hear me..., Bygones.  It may
be cloudy and dreary here, but I *did* send you an
invitation to the party.</a>

<p>
A rhowdy chorus in the background (with strange kind of
Texan accents breaks into song):

<p>
    Ding dong, LA is dead
<br>
    LA, *fahnallllly* is dead

<p>
<a name="3600qlink1">A small voice in the background pipes up -- "If LA
took Arizona and New Mexico with it, does this mean
we now have more waterfront property?</a>
