<p>
How about a part C wants part A to win battles between part A &amp; B?
As in my "I'm a long-term person" module wants my "tenure would be
cool" module to win over my "gosh a nap would be nice" module.

<p>
I agree that it might be cleaner to always talk about W1 and the parts
involved.  I was proposing how we can make sense of W2, etc. statements.
But just because we can make sense of them doesn't mean there aren't
cleaner ways to say the same thing.
