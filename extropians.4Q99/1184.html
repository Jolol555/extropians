<p>
NEW YORK — It was one of thousands of letters bearing the president's
signature and only contained three paragraphs of type on that classic,
understated White House stationery.

<p>
Yet, unlike the countless messages of thanks and congratulations that make
up much of the president's correspondence, this was one of those rare
letters that could affect history.

<p>
"Dear Dr. [Harold] Shapiro," Clinton greeted the chairman of the National<br>
Bioethics Advisory Commission, "This week's report [November 1998] of the
creation of an embryonic stem cell that is part human and part cow raises
the most serious of ethical, medical and legal concerns. I am deeply
troubled by this news of experiments involving the mingling of human and
non-human species."

<p>
Clinton is not alone. Lawmakers in the Capitol and state houses across the
U.S. are struggling to get a handle on the complex scientific advances that
have occurred in recent years. Some sound like life-saving miracles, while
others raise fears of mad scientists on the loose.

<p>
Many of these advancements, from cloning to stem-cell research, in-vitro
fertilization, and bacteriology, often find their proponents accused of
<br>
"playing God." And practitioners of a growing field of philosophical science<br>
known as bioethics are the ones called upon to act as referees in the bouts
between religion and science.
