A gentleman I know who was an intelligence officer in the US Army in the
50's in West Berlin and elsewhere. It might have been longer to veggie
status, as I was a while ago that he told me about when he was given the
breifing on it, which he said was simply titled "Removal of Sensation".
He never practiced that himself, he says. They apparently had plenty of
former Gestapo troops around who were quite adept and experienced from
the war to help get the info they needed...
