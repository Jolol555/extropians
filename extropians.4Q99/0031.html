 Strangely enough, I'd go retro.  I'd like something that had sort of a noir 
 feel to it, cool and deadly, but that could break out into a driving beat at 
 any minute.  I like the idea of dressing to the nines, tuxes and dinner 
 jackets, flowing dresses daringly cut.  &gt;&gt;


<p>
Actually this brings up a good point! 

<p>
The reason why lounge culture didn't REALLy catch on? it takes too much 
fr*ggn work! First of all, Jazz music and swing, as opposed to grunge or 
puck, requires extensive practice - and big bands take teamwork and a lot of 
money to tour.

<p>
 Second, all that grooming and dressing takes an effort way beyond the 
genXers who promoted swing.

with nodes we can plug in a play sax overnight and retro will become a
