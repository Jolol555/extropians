<a href="0390.html#0393qlink1">&gt; If that's the case, then Institutes of Verification that require</a><br>
<i>&gt; re-passing a written exam or one-day hands-on demonstration once a year</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be more in demand by employers.  And again, how do you "cram" for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hands-on test?</i><br>

<p>
What do you mean by "hands-on?"  The most obvious example *I* can think
of, hands-on anatomy in med school, is often crammed in anticipation for
an examination.  I can't think of a MORE hands on examination than that,
and students still cram for it, and still forget the material a month
later.  Or did you have something else in mind?

<p>
A yearly exam might do, but, as I'd argued, the more often the testing,
the better the incentives to learn long term, and the more accurate the
test becomes.

<i>&gt; admitted to Harvard? </i><br>

<p>
Is this a reductio attempt on MY argument???  I argued that standardized
testing AND teacher's evaluations were necessary.  (And Harvard wisely
looks at both.)  If anyone's argument is susceptible to this kind of
criticism, it's Lee's argument, which depends on standardized exams ALONE
for the allocation of credentials.</a>
