<a name="2947qlink1">That wasn't put by Eliezer, but by me. My point is that 
killing yourself (permanently) is stupid because it robs 
you of a potentially infinite amount of "pleasure points" 
<a name="2998qlink1">(pleasure being the interim meaning of life because</a> all 
our goals are based on the pleasure-discomfort principle, 
the carrot and the stick). Why do we think that a certain
action or goal is good? Because it makes us *feel good*. 
Therefore, the logical thing to do is to stay alive and 
be pleasured whenever possible until you find something 
more meaningful, if there is such a thing at all.</a>

<p>
<a name="2947qlink2"><a name="2913qlink1">Sure, people will kill themselves in difficult situations 
(and/or because their brains are out of balance), but strictly 
speaking this isn't rational, certainly not in this day and age 
with its prospect of immortality and sustainable mood enhancement 
(among other things).</a></a>
