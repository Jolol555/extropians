<p>
"Who cares?" ? I'll bet Dr. Robin cares about the degrees that Dr.
Robin holds. (And me too. I know something about his long and
hard-earned effort.)<a name="0221qlink1"> I would guess that the other list members that
hold degrees would care similarly about the hard struggle and effort
in gaining their degrees.</a>

<p>
If a person is really passionate about the work that they do, then
holding degrees in ones' field has a special meaning. Those degrees
are not medals that they think that they can hang around their neck,
nor are the degrees a guaranteed admittance to the job world
(certainly not in astronomy). Those degrees are symbols to
themselves that they were committed to learning and gaining an
expertise in a particular area. In some fields, it's not necessary
to have a degree to gain an expertise, in other fields (like
science) it is (usually) necessary.

<p>
I think that the main issue here is whether a person loves their
work.<a name="0221qlink2"> If a person truly loves their work, and are committed to it, it
shows in every aspect of their life. Degrees, papers, products,
talks, paintings, music compositions, etc. are natural by-products of
<a name="0221qlink3">this passion.</a> How many people really love their work? How many people
jump out of bed in the morning and say, "Oh boy, another day that I
can do my job!" I would guess that not a significant proportion of
the population feel that way.

Pursuing one's dream(s) is what life is all about (my personal
opinion).
