In my mid-twenties, I'm happy to say I still have dreams of flying on a
semi-regular basis.  These usually involve flying far above a city; well,
let's say anywhere from 30 feet to cloud level.  Generally I'm kind of
bobbing up and down, and it requires a sort of concentration to stay aloft,
or perhaps just making super-leaps from the ground.  However once in a while
I really seem to get the hang of it and just soar...  I love those parts,
and I love these dreams in general.
