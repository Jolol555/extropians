Hi Amara -- I looked up while doing my nightly walk to the beach.  It
wasn't snowing here in LA, but the overcast was pretty dense. Sorry the
weather was bad for you.

<p>
I heard some local friends were heading toward the high desert and while
driving looked up a bit too much and got pulled over by the police, and
then an escort for a number of miles.  The only stars they saw was on
police jackets and fortunately not shooting.
