Yes. You're right, in the technical context, regarding the temperature of 
space as a medium that exchanges heat via conduction/convection (and yes, 
there's not much convection absent a strong gravity gradient, but work with 
me for a minute and grant that, e.g., the 50-ton total mass of  Luna's 
atmosphere probably could be said to convect and could also be regarded as 
a pretty creditable "spacelike" medium... but I digress).

<p>
And so, I take the question "what is the temperature of space?" in two ways.

<p>
The first is, as you say, whatever temperature _space_ is doesn't much 
matter, whatever the average speed of a particle, there are so few that the 
actual temperature of the medium as such doesn't matter because the _rate_ 
at at which any (quasi) convective transfer could occur is so low.

<p>
The second is to do exactly what I've done (as have others): take the 
question to mean (or rather, take the questioner to want to know) "What 
will _my_ (skin? boundary layer? something like that) equilibrium 
temperature be, from a practical, embodied perspective, and please be 
polite about it, won't you--will I be far from comfortable?"

<p>
In that nontechnical, folk sense:
<br>
First:  the Spockian reply--"It doesn't matter"--causes some friction or 
torsion in the questioner, who still wants to know "would I die or what?" 
So that's not a satisfying answer in the folk context.

<p>
Second: "The impolite answer is "oh, it cycles around the freezing point of 
water at 1 AU." or somesuch.

<p>
Third: The polite answer is "Well, your shadow side freezes, and your sun 
side bakes, but at well below the temperature of molten lead (ca. 200 
C).--in a can with some air conditioning, you could probably stay 
comfortable. At least, in this neighborhood."

<p>
Note that I did say "What is Your Temperature?" earlier in the DUMB JOKE 
thread. So I'd already made this sloppy rfolk meaning assignment.

<p>
I support what you've said, just wanted to share my sloppy terminology 
exegesis...
