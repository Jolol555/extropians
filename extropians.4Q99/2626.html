I was thrilled when I heard that Judge Posner was to be the Microsoft 
mediator.  My torts professor stuck his neck out a billion years ago when he 
used Posner's then-new case book as our basic text in my first-year torts 
class.  This experience went a long way to preparing me to understand and 
accept David Friedman's work . . .
