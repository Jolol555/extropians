In a message dated 12/2/99 12:09:15 PM Central Standard Time, 
lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net(none) is rumored to have written regarding the 
following quote;

<p>
<a href="2955.html#3008qlink1">&gt; &gt; Then could you kindly provide the reference to the paper</a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; that shows the scanning electron micrographs of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; the banded viral isolate.  "Show me the money".</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Such mote-in-your-brother's-eye arguments are a common tactic of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  creationists and other crackpots, including the "HIV is not AIDS"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  crowd. </i><br>

<p>
and furthermore he says...

<p>
<a href="2955.html#3008qlink2">&gt;that the HIV family of viruses, spread by exchange of bodily fluids,</a><br>
<i>&gt;cause AIDS.  If you're not infected, you won't get the disease.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Millions of confirmations of this should not be upset by a few unusual</i><br>
<i>&gt;cases that will be expected in any investigation.  Anyone who claims</i><br>
<i>&gt;otherwise has an agenda that they value more than the truth.</i><br>


<p>
I've been following this thread with great interest.  Sadly I have no 
particular credentials to back up anything that I can say regarding 
it....other than what I've read and what I've seen.

<p>
Howsomeever...as one gentle man once said .."Methinks he protests too much".

<p>
<a name="3075qlink1">It's been my experience that when the personal integrity of the opponent  is 
questioned then it's a bad sign for the side doing the questioning.  It makes 
me wonder how strong their case</a> is.

<p>
I've read the book by Micheal Fumonto &lt;sp?&gt; years ago...."The myth of 
Heterosexual Aides"....and I've followed some of the reasoning put forth by 
James P. Hogan (yes...he DOES write SF....I happen to like SF)....with great 
interest.  So far as I've seen noone has refuted their arguments.  

<p>
They HAVE however resorted to namecalling and mudslinging..
