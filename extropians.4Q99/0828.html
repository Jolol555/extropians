There are two elements of this problem that are relatively fixed in
difficulty: detecting and tracking an incoming missile, and guiding your
anti-missile to a successful intercept.  Both of these problems were
daunting in the sixties, which is why early ABM systems were not cost
<a name="0853qlink1">effective.<a name="0835qlink3">  These days they are much easier, so ABM systems are becoming
feasible.  In another decade they will be fairly insignificant problems,
thanks to continuing improvements in computers, sensors</a> and
telecomminications.

<p>
<a name="0853qlink2">At that point the problem collapses to a contest of agility between reentry
vehicles and missile-killing devices.</a>  Since a pound of ABM is much cheaper
than a pound of reentry vehicle (because you don't have to pay for a bigger
ICBM to deliver it), this situation will tend to favor the defense.  When
you factor in the near-term prospects for directed energy weapons, the
<a name="0835qlink4">future looks pretty dim for the ICBM.

<p>
Of course, there are lots of ther ways to deliver a bomb.  However, most of
the militarily usefull methods (cruise missiles, stealth bombers, etc)
require considerably more advanced technology than ICBMs, and they are all
vulnerable to interception by various other defenses.
