Mormons Quasi-Christian!?  I spent two years in the Bible belt being called 
<a name="1964qlink1">things like that.  And now on the extropian list!  I guess where there are 
two religious believers and the beliefs are somewhat different there is 
bound to be trouble. :)  And it is the the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints or the Mormons, not the "Church of Mormons."</a> lol

One thing I appreciate about the Mormon view on the fall of Adam is that the 
fall was a good thing that was planned to be to make Adam and Eve mortal and 
able to reproduce.  Mainstream Christianity states that the fall was a 
tragic mistake and without it Adam and Eve would have brought forth a 
perfected race of humanity without sin.

<p>
I appreciate belonging to a church that teaches about the premortal 
existance of humanity, an apostasy and restoration and the doctrine of 
eternal marriage and family life.

<p>
I have already posted on my experiences and thoughts on religion and my 
faith in great detail.  I believe and yet I do have my doubts at times.  I 
have learned another view of things from this list and have found myself 
treated well here.  May we all in the end learn the ultimate truths and find 
peace and joy in our lives as the decades and centuries pass by.  This is my 
most sincere hope.


<p>
best regards,

<p>
John Grigg
