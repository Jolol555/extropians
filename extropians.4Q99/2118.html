You bet.  A large fraction of the project (maybe 75% of the lead time and
10% of the money) could be done before the assembler breakthrough.  If we
had a firm date for the invention of the necessary nanotech we could
schedule the whole project around that to optimize our chance of success.
Since we don't have such a date we should a) start work early and b) make an
effort to develop better nanotech projections.

I think that preliminary work like locating a viable launch site, dealing
with the local government and working out preliminary hardware</a> designs
should all begin a good 5-8 years before anyone expects to see a
general-purpose assembler.  Working out a good colonization plan is
something we could start doing now - it doesn't take any much money at all
and it will be critical to a successful project.
