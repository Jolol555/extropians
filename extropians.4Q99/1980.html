<a href="1979.html#1980qlink1">&gt; &gt; I like Dennett too, but I am not sure I am sold on the ideas of memes.</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Certainly from the perspective of the conference. How do you think memes</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would resolve any of the binding problems?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I am sort of curious: people talk about memes as this really groovy</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; explanation, but I can't see them as being an improvement over the ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; associated with cognition. How is 'memetics' a more powerful tool for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; understanding thoughts, emotions, or consciousness, than those developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in cognitive neuroscience (which lack any mention of memes).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You're right of course: memetics doesn't tell you anything about how</i><br>
<i>&gt; the brain works, any more than genetics tells you how DNA works.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; quite the opposite perspective.  Evolution of DNA explains many of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical traits we see in various animal species; similarly, memetics</i><br>
<i>&gt; can explain some of the aspects of human culture that the human mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; has produced, but it has nothing at all to say about how the mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself works--that's still being shaped by good old DNA.  Once a kid</i><br>
<i>&gt; starts learning, his actions may be shaped by memetic inheritance,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the brain itself and how it processes thoughts and emotions are</i><br>
<i>&gt; already formed at birth.  If it weren't, there wouldn't be any medium</i><br>
<i>&gt; for memes to replicate in.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The only slight influence memetic evolution might have on the working</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the brain itself is through pseudo-Lamarckian Baldwin effects (i.e.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; cultural choices as an environmental factor selecting for genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; traits).</i><br>

<a name="1981qlink1">So should we bring out calipers and reinstate phrenology?  Likely not.  The
nature vis-a-vis nurture debate is a longstanding one.

<p>
Good DNA is doubtless a beneficial factor when it comes to the ability to
learn, but at the same time, problem solving skills are a largely learned
</a>
skill.

<p>
Brain chemistry is a vast field, and one best left to brain chemists.  By the
same token, the large-scale (over)prescription of mood-altering drugs can be a
bad thing.

<p>
Memetics, if being the study and analysis of memes and memetic transition, is
tightly bound with sociology and psychology.
