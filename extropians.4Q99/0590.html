<i>&gt;moral choices by a conscience that says:  "Well done, good and faithful </i><br>
<i>&gt;servant" should suffice.</i><br>

<p>
I fail to see the logic behind threatening to lable people as sociopaths for 
having a differen't oppinion as you do.</a>

<p>
<a name="0597qlink2">Also, I would hope noone would degrade themselves to say they are servants.</a>

<p>
<a name="0597qlink3"><i>&gt;And one very good way to receive this enhancement of self-esteem is, when </i><br>
<a href="0562.html#0590qlink2">&gt;appropriate, to subordinate your own needs to the welfare of others whose </a><br>
<i>&gt;lives might contain less "quiet despair", and more faith in themselves, </i><br>
<i>&gt;more hope for a better future, as a result of your effort</i><br>

<p>
</a>If that works for you.

<a href="0562.html#0590qlink3">&gt;Isn't this the mission of Extropians? Surely you don't believe that "when </a><br>
<i>&gt;the ship is sinking, it's every man for himself".</i><br>

<p>
My mission is to live forever and hopefully influence the world to allow us 
all to live in the most free way so noone has to fight off riducles ideas 
forced upon them.

<p>
<a href="0562.html#0590qlink4">&gt;Some members may ask: "Owen, what do your remarks have to do with</a><br>
<i>&gt;extropianism?"  Well, does it matter, until you deal with the would-be </i><br>
<a name="0597qlink4"><i>&gt;extropians in your membership who have not emotionally matured beyond the </i><br>
<i>&gt;primary narcissism of a three year old?</i><br>

<p>
Robert, I would appreciate it if you didn't resort to name calling when 
dealing with such important disscussions.  They don't contribute.</a>
