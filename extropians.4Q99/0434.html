<a name="0449qlink1">I didn't contend that.  Our socialization leads us to express the
sex drive in different fashion.  Women are taught to disguise
their advances, to pretend that they aren't pursuing someone, to
use passive-aggression.  Signs are that more women are throwing
off that conditioning.</a>

<p>
I'm not going to get you to read basic sociological, medial and psychological research either, but that's another matter.
