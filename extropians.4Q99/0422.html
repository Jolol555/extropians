                              The Nano-promise?



</pre>
<p>
   "Wish, And It WILL BE So!"  That could conceivably be an end-game of<br>
   today's nascent nanotechnology research, if Mitre's James
   Ellenbogen's vision comes to pass.  Working on Mitre's
   nanotechnology program, Ellenbogen believes that within 20 years we
   may have "desktop manufacturing" devices that will let us download
   descriptions and instructions for physical devices -- and the
<br>
   "nanobox" will then "make it so."<br>

<p>
   According to Ellenbogen in the Aug. 30 BusinessWeek
   (<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_35/b3644001.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_35/b3644001.htm</a>  - choose Item
   #4, "Nanotech," on the left-hand menu), brought to our attention by
   RCFoC reader Ken Berntsen,

<pre>
       "...the grand slam in the matter-is-software ballpark will be
       the nanobox. This is a sort of futuristic copy machine that
       combines nanotech fabrication with today's so-called
       desktop-manufacturing methods, used mainly to knock out quick
       prototypes of new products. If you want a new cell phone, you'll
       purchase a recipe on the Net. It will tell you to insert a sheet
       of plastic and squirt electrically conductive molecules into the
       ''toner'' cartridge. The nanobox will pass the plastic back and
       forth, laying down patterns of molecules, then electrically
       direct them to assemble themselves into circuits and an antenna.
       Next, using different ''toners,'' the nanobox will add a keypad,
       speaker, and microphone and finally build up a housing."

<p>
   OK, I know this sounds like the best of science fiction, but
   Congress thinks enough of the concept to want to double the current
   $232 million appropriation for nanotech research.  And the White
   House considers nanotechnology research to be in its top 11 critical
   research areas.

<p>
   Now just imagine -- IF -- this were to come to pass, what it would
   do to our traditional physical goods economy.  And while I'm not
   saying, at this point, that each of us will soon be able to print
   our own cell phones and other goodies, remember how "impossible" 650
   MHz PCs, and $250 photo-realistic inkjet printers, and the expensive
   stereolithography devices which DO create prototype physical parts
   out of "nothing" today, seemed twenty years ago.

<p>
   It's seems that it's only "the impossible," that's impossible...
