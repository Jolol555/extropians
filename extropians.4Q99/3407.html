<br>
An Investment Opinion

Replicating Higher 

<p>
Geron Corp. (Nasdaq: GERN), a developer of therapeutic and diagnostic
products based on the biological mechanisms underlying cancer and other
age-related diseases, replicated $2 9/16 higher to $12 5/16 this morning.
After the bell yesterday, the firm announced the upcoming publication of
two papers -- for the January 1, 1999 issue of Nature Genetics --
displaying evidence that "telomerase expression in normal cells confers an
infinite replicative capacity, but does not result in cellular changes
associated with cancer."

<p>
Under normal circumstances, human cells divide roughly 75 times over a
lifetime (depending on the type of cell). However, each time a cell
divides, the "telomere" -- or the protective end of a chromosome -- erodes
a little bit. In conjunction with old age and eventual death, the telomere
becomes too short to protect the chromosome and the cell can no longer
divide. By adulthood, most healthy cells no longer contain any telomerase.
It has also been found that 90% of cancer cells have telomerase, raising
suspicions that telomerase is somehow linked to cancer as well. 

<p>
Back in January, Geron's biologists announced a ground-breaking finding.
While all cells possess the telomerase gene, which can restore the
telomeres to their youthful length, in most cells the gene is inactive.
Geron's discovery was that by inserting a copy of the telomerase gene in
active form into cells, it could make them grow and divide indefinitely.
The problem posed by the discovery was the possibility that the enzyme
could cause cancer by allowing cell division to go crazy.

<p>
Yesterday's announcement by Geron will undoubtedly lead to closer scrutiny
of the findings, but it has given Geron a proverbial shot in the arm. Yes,
Geron lost $5.7 million in cash from operations over the first nine months
of the year. No, the discussion to date has yet to veer into the realm of
applications for "immortalizing" cells. However, this finding and the
recent cash infusion from the sale of $15 million in convertible zero
debentures to investment funds should help meet Geron's working capital
needs. The visibility of the announcement will also help Geron shift the
discussion toward finding solutions for the more immediate problem of the
two dozen degenerative diseases that currently have no treatment."
