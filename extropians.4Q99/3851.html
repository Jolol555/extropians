<a name="3865qlink1">I am not a doctor, nor an expert on the subject, but I do have a couple
friends that have used MDMA extensively.  There is one apparent
side-effect that is common to them that may or may not be from heavy MDMA
usage, although it is not readily obvious unless you interact with them
regularly.

They have extremely poor short-term memory, much worse than I have</a> ever

seen in a normal person.  We have speculated in the past that it was
from heavy usage of MDMA and its analogs.  They did not always have this
problem, which is why we attributed it to drug use (MDMA specifically
because we had heard that it could cause these types of problems).

<p>
<a name="3873qlink2">But as I said, I am no expert on the subject; I am just reporting what
I and others have noticed.  By "poor" short-term memory, I mean that I
could spend an hour helping them go over some subject matter, and the next
day they would not remember that they had even talked to me about it. 
Long-term memory seems fine, though.</a></a>
