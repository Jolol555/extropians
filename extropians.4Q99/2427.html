<i>&gt; clusters (derived from galactic velocities) than in the galaxies</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves (including the galactic dark matter).  There is some</i><br>

<p>
On reading the paper in more detail, it is necessary for them to assume
that conditions in the adjacent "brane(s)" are very different from here.
Specifically the matter density must be lower, so that galaxies and
clusters have not yet formed.  If they did, we would expect to see see
missing mass within globular clusters, and it is not present there.

<p>
On the other hand the density can't be too low or there wouldn't be enough
to explain the missing mass.

<p>
There is a magic value of about 1/4 the local density that looks like it
would work, but it is pretty ad hoc to start juggling parameters like
that.  It's much simpler to assume that the universe is much the same
everywhere.
