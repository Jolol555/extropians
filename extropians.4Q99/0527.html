<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;So, how do we reform education?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; How about having all private schools?  That would create great </i><br>
<i>&gt;competition</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for the best education.  Or how about allowing parents to choose where </i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; send their children instead of dividing them up into districts?  I like </i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; private school idea better.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;...And after the separation of school and state, the privatized education</i><br>
<i>&gt;system then needs to separate instruction from credentialing.  It is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;clear conflict of interest that the same institution that teaches you</i><br>
<i>&gt;things at great expense is also the one that verifies that you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;learned them and issues you a valuable credential.  If the credentialing</i><br>
<i>&gt;authority were independent, it would be capable of judging the school as</i><br>
<i>&gt;well as the student, and the credential would be more meaningful.</i><br>

Actually, having spent quite a bit of time working with various private 
schools in Orange County in the '80's, trying to bring them up to speed on 
computers, I can assure you that the private schools for the most part offer 
pretty much the same mindless idiocy as the public ones - just higher 
quality.  Most of the parents are themselves products of public education 
and have no real basis to choose anything else.  Good idea regarding 
credentialing, though.
