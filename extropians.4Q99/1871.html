I think you have a point with 'emes'. (however, the term emetic is not
very good - it is medicalese for a drug that produces vomiting :-) It
reminds me a bit of soliton waves, where a soliton wave doesn't
disperse and generally behaves as a kind of particle. Maybe an
interesting class of emes would be the discrete emes that don't
disperse quickly (like an electromagnetic wave would, when it reflects
from the environment). The momentum of the pool ball might or might
not belong to this class depending on the timescale you use (in the
long run the momentum has dispersed into heat). Such emes may interact
with each other and the environment, replicate and sometimes die
out. Their discreteness makes them easier to handle than just general
effects that spread over multiple substrates. I'm still not sure what
explanative/predictive functionality they might have, but it seems to
me that we need a vocabulary to speak about substrate independent (or
weakly substrate coupled) phenomena.
