I disagree with Greg here (and appear to agree with Curt Adams).  I think that
"ought" questions are a subset of "is" questions. There is some matter of
fact regarding what it is that I want, and what it is that I would want</a> if I

and the world I live in, you could figure out what I want.  And as far as I

questions about what various creatures want.</a></a>

<p>
"Science" and "humanities" are both approaches that are in principle capable
of helping us find out what we want.  The post-modern is one particular
style within the humanities, and some post-modern approaches are likely more
effective than others.  Most likely there are also several approaches which
are best described as neither science nor humanities.  The question is
which, if any, approach is more effective in helping us find out what we
want.  And we should keep in mind that people tend to exaggerate the
differences between approaches.
