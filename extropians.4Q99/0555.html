<a href="0531.html#0555qlink1">&lt;&lt; This ignores my question - if I pay money to give my child an education</a><br>
 what financial reward do I get in return?  The question isn't about the
 parents love for the child or their social responsibility to the child, it
 is often the case that parents cannot afford what they think is best.
 However, perhaps it is possible to make education an investment that has a
 financial reward rather than one of love and/or prestige.

 Yes, and the problem is that most people can only accept a financial benefit
 for their investment, they cannot afford to give their children everything
 they would want to give them.  But if it is true that better education would
 mean a more successful and wealthy child then there is a financial benefit
 to be had from the child, and the parent (or sponsor) should expect a return
 on their investment.  This would also mean that those people who do not feel
 the natural urge to care for their children have a financial incentive to
 offer them the best education and welfare possible.

As to the question of investment in children and repayment, this is the way 
it is viewed in my family:  What a parent does for their child, it is 
expected to be repaid by that child doing for their own children.  The debt 
is eternal; each generation repaying the love, time, effort and resources 
invested in them by doing the same for the next generation.  I find it an 
elegant system, and plan to continue it.  You could consider it a very long 
term investment in the family.
