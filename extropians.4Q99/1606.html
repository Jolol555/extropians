<a name="1613qlink1">I have had plenty of dreams where I was not myself. I have been
everything from disembodied observers over interstellar economies to a
Axiomatically Invincible Hero to the god Odin.</a>

<p>
(The Axiomatically Invincible Hero might need an explanation. In one
dream I encountered a box containing something awful breaking out,
just like the start of Jurassic Park. But this beast was an Axiomatic
Beast, which meant that it would - by definition - devour any victim
it pursued. I only had moments to prepare - so I redefined myself as
axiomatically impossible to defeat. Since the Beast couldn't eat me
without causing a paradox, it escaped into other parts of my dream...)

<i>&gt; Makes me think of pseudo-science.  Dream interpretation and all that.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1613qlink2">While a lot of dream interpretation is junk, dreams are after all
information about our minds. I would say that our dream "landscapes"
say a bit about what kind of people we are, what is going on and what
worldviews we inhabit.</a>

<p>
Yes... my internal world seems to be quite unusual :-)
