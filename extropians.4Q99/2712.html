<p>
Primarily it goes into energy, which gets used to convert pyruvate back into
glucose, so the brain and muscle can leave aerobic metabolism on low.  It
can also make or interconvert most amino acids.  The glycerol moiety can
be made into glucose, but not the rest.

There's always a little bit of ketones about but Pritikin and Ornish should 
not
<br>
increase it over the basal level: no starvation and plenty of glucose.

<p>
Stryer's says the adipocytes just dump fatty acids into the blood, where they
complex with blood proteins.  Other cells can take up the fatty acids 
directly.
<br>
Normally, ketone bodies are just another way to ship fat energy around 
(I'm not sure why - they are more soluble).  In Atkins-style ketosis, however,
the body cannot use as much of the ketone bodies as it makes, so they
pile up in the blood and eventually get lost through the kidneys.
