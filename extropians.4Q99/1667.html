<p>
That was the Siljan Gas Project, where they drilled in the region
around lake Siljan in Sweden. The place is rather interesting, an old
impact crater (a few tens of kilometers across) where Gold's theories
said methane would have been trapped beneath the rock. There was quite
a bit of interest in the drilling, not unlike participating in a
lottery (OK, the likeliehood of winning is slight... but IF you
win!). As you said, the project failed to find any oil or gas.</a>

<p>
What they did find, and didn't realize the importance of, was strange
organic gunk from deep in the ground. I remember seeing it on
television and thinking "Hmm, could that be bacterial films from deep
in the rock?" - they might have discovered the subterranean ecosystem
several years ahead if they had not been too hungry for oil.
