It was pretty cool, several times that I remember, in a localized time period
over a couple weeks.  That is, flight dreams.  It was themed with skiing.  The
context was above the tree line.  A friend's presence was near, we didn't
communicate.  It wasn't anywhere I had been physically.  So the dream context
started with flight, it was a neat sensation.  I flew past a couple skiers.
Anyways, the series of flight dreams were initalized by sliding, slippery slope
type phenomenon, then initial flight.  When first starting, there are some
other presences, they are there to reassure you to some extent, if only by
their presence, they are presences in the same context that you are, in a
way.   There is a sense of freedom which is very itself.  After some initial
confusion, it's pretty cool.  So that is my story about some dreams.

<p>
Some people keep dream journals, I think that's a pleasant idea, although do
not or ever.

<p>
I often have dreams with a sexual context, mostly about women I have been with,
one or two or three unknowns, mostly separately.  Almost all dreams with these
women have sexual content.

<p>
I find dreaming very pleasant.  I am trying to recall unpleasant or unsettling
dreams, the only ones that come to mind are danger to family.

<p>
Back to pseudo-science, dreams would be interrelated with any other companion
of man, like astrology, psychology.  Some might assign extra-sensory attributes
in this category.

<p>
In terms of hard science and dreams, I guess there is REM sleep described by
physical eye motor decalibration and brain wave cycles.  I read somewhere that
sleep is best partaken in 4 hour intervals, although to each his own.

<p>
Have a nice day,
