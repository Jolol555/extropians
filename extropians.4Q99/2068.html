**LA CryoFeast '99:	Saturday, December 18, 1999**<br>

<p>
6:00 - until Party!  Eat, drink and be merry Pot Luck dinner.  Bring your
favorite delicious dishes. And, for those of you who would rather expand
your brain than your belly, we have books from some of our favorite authors.

<p>
While others may be a little behind the times in giving thanks for the
harvest; we cryonicsts are giving thanks for the technologies that may help
us to live healthfully and indefinitely.  

<p>
The annual CryoFeast is an Alcor Foundation tradition bringing together
Alcor members and other life extension enthusiasts to celebrate our
continued efforts and accomplishments in cryonics and life extension.  As a
CryoFeast, guests are asked to contribute to the Pot Luck dinner as well as
any talents for making the party a fun-loving event.  

<p>
For many years the CryoFeast was held at Dr. Timothy Leary's home in
Beverly Hills.  The past two years, we gave the theme a spin and decided
that having co-hosted CryoFeasts in varied locations would enable people to
get together all over the World.  There have been a number of artistic
events occuring in and around the CryoFeasats.  The Boston location
co-hosted by Tony Reno and Roderick Carder-Russell has been creative in
designing their own style of party, and Silicon Valley's parties at Niki
Freeman's home and also co-hosts Dave Krieger and Geoff Dale, among others.
In 1997, we had six different CryoFeast locations around the World. 

<p>
This year, as tradition, I will present an Internet.art Virtual Operning
Reception: "The Aesthetics of Memetic Evolution 3"  Internet.art which will
be up at www.extropic-art.com/aesthetics3.htm on **Friday, December 17,
1999.**
