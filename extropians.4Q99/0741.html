preacher freind of mine today on scientific dating methods, logical
inference, etc., as he is a big creationist, and does a program on the
local public access channel. He was talking about some creationist
'scientist' named Gish that he purports is rather good at arguing the
creationist case. Anyone heard of him?</a>
