The Mars Petition
<hr>

<p>
The time has come for humanity to journey to Mars. 

<p>
Humanity yearns for a challenge, one that will let us exercise the
limitless potential, now dormant, that lies waiting within ourselves. The
prospects facing our generation have never been greater; with world peace,
unprecedented economic growth, and extraordinary technological innovation,
we find ourselves at the threshold of a new millennium of opportunity. The
human exploration of Mars will be our generation's crowning achievement.

<p>
We must go for the knowledge of Mars. Finding evidence of life on Mars
would demonstrate that the origin of life is not unique to the Earth, and,
by implication, reveal a universe that is filled with life and most likely
intelligence as well. This would be the most important scientific
enlightenment since Copernicus' discoveries.  

<p>
We must also go for the knowledge of Earth. Mars, the planet most like
Earth, is believed to have had a wet climate and can help us understand the
impact of climactic change on our home world. The knowledge we gain could
be key to our survival. 

<p>
We call upon the leaders of the world to commit to the immediate human
exploration of Mars. It is our wish that, in the spirit of history's
greatest explorers, the first humans will set foot on Mars by 2015, with
the ultimate goal of developing a sustained presence. We urge our leaders
to have the vision to provide for the citizens they represent a future
without limits, one that matches our potential and our country's greatness,
and is worthy of the dreams of our children.

<p>
Believing therefore that the exploration and settlement of Mars represent
the greatest human endeavor of our time, I add my signature to the Mars
Petition.
