I'll extend this a little bit.  You have 3 ways to cool something --
conduction, convection and radiation.  In a vacumn, as in the case
of a man in space, you have conduction through the suit leading to
radiation into space.  You have to balance this with the radiation
he is receiving from space that may be absorbed by the suit.  As
Doug points out, white suits significantly reduce the radiation that
gets absorbed.

of the dark side of the moon or Mercury.  If Amara reads this
she might be able to tell us the effective temperature when
you are facing the planetary plane (say on most planets equators)
vs. facing away from from the plane (say on the poles of most
planets).</a>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A thermos has low thermal emissivity walls, so the radiative heat transfer</i><br>

<p>
Its a little more complex.  The inside of a thermos is reflective (that's
why they look like a mirror on the inside), so radiation from the liquid
gets reflected back into the interior.  Then there is a vacuum between
the internal and external thermos walls so that there is no heat
conduction.  The two ways you lose heat from a thermos is some radiation
through the vacuum from the heated inner wall (from the energy that
doesn't get reflected back inside) and a small amount of conduction
through the those portions of the thermos where the inner and outer
walls are joined together.

<i>&gt; Yes, this is a strength of the skinsuit concept, particularly for Mars. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3155qlink1">True, but its questionable whether you can consider the Mars atmosphere
a vacuum.   Scientists talk about the "atmosphere" of Mercury and its
pressure is much lower than Mars.</a>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Yep, spacecraft designers, and especially telescope designers have to
put much more attention on keeping things cool than keeping them warm.
For infrared telescopes they are doing designs that place a large
separation between the telescope optics and the computers and communications
because of all the heat they generate.
