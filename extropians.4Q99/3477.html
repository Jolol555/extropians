I think reasoning clauses and hand-code a true AI is now fairly firmly
disproved. I like LISP as much as the next person, and personally
think some of the biggest and most robust systems even have been
written in it. Heck, I use XEmacs, and I love it despite all its
failings. God knows, I was even a firm believer in AI in mid-80s
myself. I simply didn't knew better back then.

<p>
However, I now do not see any alternative in stealing from the design
of life, either by blind copying the blueprints, or (better)
harnessing the metamethod (evolution) itself.

<p>
Nonbrittleness, massive finest-grain parallelism and an astonishing
economy of resource utilization are not possible to achieve
otherwise. This comes at a price, of course: the evolved designs are
not understandable by a human. A nightmare of coupled autofeedback
loops do not appeal to the orderly engineer's mind. However, as long
as it outperforms anything the engineer can produce, I do not really
care.

<p>
If it thinks, do we really have to know in detail how and why it
thinks? And if we _really_ have to, we can really find out later.

<p>
Weird? Sounds like a badge of honour to me.
