If there was ever an irony in using state power to try to control 
competition, we may be seeing it now in the failed strategy described in this 
piece I dug up from last December:

1998--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</pre>
<p>
Environmental Jeremiahs have long predicted that the biotechnology industry 
would create something it couldn't control. Now it seems they were right. Was 
it the tomato that trampled Topeka? No, something worse: negative public 
opinion.

<p>
In the early 1980s, a few major agrochemical-biotechnology companies, led by 
Monsanto, approached senior policy makers in the Reagan administration and 
requested more-restrictive regulation, primarily from the Environmental 
Protection Agency. They argued that there is something fundamentally 
different and worrisome about genetically engineered crops, and disputed the 
consensus among the international scientific community that the new 
biotechnology is no more than an extension of earlier techniques, posing 
little risk and much promise.

<p>
That consensus is simple common sense. After all, dozens of new plant 
varieties modified with less precise, traditional genetic-engineering methods 
such as hybridization safely enter the marketplace every year without 
government involvement. Indeed, genetically altered varieties of wheat, corn, 
rice, oats and other common crops have been an integral part of Western diets 
for decades.

<p>
Monsanto and its allies had an important motive for this counterintuitive 
strategy. Their aim was to use regulation as a market-entry barrier to 
competitors--in particular, seed companies and biotech startups--that were 
less able to bear the high costs of unnecessary regulation.

<p>
They achieved their goal. The Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug 
Administration and especially the EPA introduced policies that discriminated 
against crop and garden plants and micro-organisms crafted with gene-splicing 
techniques. These regulatory policies have put federal bureaucrats in the 
middle of virtually all field trials of gene-spliced plants, spelling 
disaster for both small businesses and academic institutions, whose 
scientists lack the resources to comply with the burdensome regulations. 
Added production costs were a particular disadvantage to products in this 
competitive, low-profit-margin market.

<p>
Few of the agbiotech companies launched in the 1980s exist today, many of 
them having been bought out at a fraction of their true value by Monsanto, 
Novartis, Dupont and other giants. But these companies are now paying the 
price for their success: Overregulation has fed antibiotechnology myths, 
playing into activists' scare scenarios and frightening consumers, 
particularly in Japan and Europe. Already, Britain has announced a moratorium 
on commercial field introductions of gene-spliced plants, and the European 
Union and Japan have likewise promulgated regressive policies.

<p>
Strangely, however, the industry, led by its lobbying arm, the Biotechnology 
Industry Organization, continues to advocate strict regulation without 
scientific foundation. Most recently, it has lobbied for United Nations-based 
biosafety regulations under the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, 
which are expected to be finalized early next year. Under this Draconian 
regime, no biologist, plant breeder or farmer will be allowed to grow and 
test a gene-spliced crop or garden plant--no matter how small the test 
plot--without prior, case-by-case approval from the U.N. Paperwork, red tape 
and corruption will dog the process from beginning to end, from the first 
seed to store shelves around the world.

<p>
Closer to home, BIO has lent its support to an EPA policy to begin regulating 
garden and crop plants as pesticides. Under this policy, case-by-case 
regulatory review will be required for even small-scale field trials of 
familiar, innocuous, commercially important gene-spliced plants genetically 
improved to enhance their resistance to pests or diseases. Imagine the shelf 
appeal to consumers of a box of strawberries or can of fruit cocktail bearing 
the label PESTICIDE.

<p>
The scientific community has repeatedly excoriated this policy. In 1996, 11 
major scientific societies, representing more than 80,000 biologists and food 
professionals, published a report warning that if the EPA policy were 
implemented, it would discourage the development of new pest-resistant crops 
(thereby prolonging and increasing the use of synthetic chemical pesticides), 
expand federal and state bureaucracies, limit the use of biotechnology to 
those few larger developers who can pay the inflated regulatory costs, and 
handicap the U.S. in competition for international markets.

<p>
Agricultural biotechnology holds tremendous potential benefits for the 
world's consumers and farmers. Under current circumstances, however, products 
will enter the marketplace at a disturbingly low rate because of gratuitous 
regulatory barriers. Research and development will focus primarily on 
commodity crops grown at huge scale, at the expense of important 
small-acreage crops. Innovation will seldom target improvement of the 
genetics of environmentally threatened but low-value species such as trees, 
or of subsistence crops such as millet, cassava and yams.

<p>
The market for agbiotech products is being undermined and distorted by 
overregulation and the public misapprehensions that it engenders. Ironically, 
both are the industry's own Frankensteinian creation.
