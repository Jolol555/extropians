You raise some interesting questions Spud, ones with which I have been
rassling for years.  For many of us who grew up in CFC-dominated (christian
<a name="1940qlink1">fundamentalist churches) society, or WASP culture, our core system
of ethics and morals are based directly on those teachings.  After years
of being atheist, I am still unable to give a simple, crisp bumper sticker
answer to those who claim that CFCs provide a solid framework upon
which to base ones morals and teach ones children ethical behavior.</a>

<p>
Of course, atheists are moral and ethical people too, but the reasons why
we are tend to be more complicated and subjective than the CFC version,
which is: god says do this, so I do.  Humanism contains all the same
core values of honesty, forthrightness, etc, but it requires *brains* instead
of blind obedience.

<p>
And to be honest, I am not sure myself that had I been an atheist from
the start, would I still have the same moral and ethical values.  I am
an extremely introspective person.  I am deeply entangled in the values
memes with which I was infected as a child.  I cannot turn them off,
even tho my mind has overpowered the &lt;god&gt;.

<p>
<a name="1976qlink1"><a name="1934qlink1"><a name="1926qlink1">Consider for instance the &lt;faithfulness in marriage&gt;.  Most would
recognize that this meme is solidly CFC based, and yet I cannot shake
</a>
this one off even if I tried,<a name="1976qlink2"> and it is unclear to me that I should try.</a>  Yet
</a>
</a>
from an atheist's point of view, it is difficult to explain to others why
the meme holds under atheism.  All I can say is:  I do not believe in
god, but I do beleive in the ethical and moral system which the &lt;god&gt;
people espouse.

<p>
As you can see, I am groping here, so anyone can jump in and help
at any time.
