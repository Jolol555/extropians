In a conversation with friends the other night I was blowing hurricane-force 
hot air to the effect (i.e. putting forward the proposition) that the 
military doctrine of the 20th century can be aptly contained between the two 
polar ideal types of the "surgical air war" and the guerrilla "people's war" 
(with the added proviso that the Wehrmacht's blitzkrieg in WWII was actually 
the embodiment of an ideal of 19th century military doctrine).  The former, 
which I called "Billy Mitchell's Dream", was finally achieved - sort of - in 
the Gulf War.  The goal of Billy Mitchell's Dream was to use air power to 
break an enemy's will to fight, first with carpet bombing of civilian targets 
and then, as technology developed, with precision guided munitions aimed at 
key elements of an opponent's C3I and other warfighting capacity itself.  
Inherent in this doctrine was the notion that the actor wielding such air 
power would not have to actually control territory, so much as deter 
international aggression by projecting force beyond its own "home turf."  The 
application of the purest form of this doctrine has actually turned out to be 
rather limited in military and political terms: The Gulf War was about as 
close to the scenario originally envisioned by the early proponents of air 
power as one can get.

<p>
The doctrine of "people's war" - Mao's type of war -- was premised on the 
notion of an ideologically motivated people waging a "war of resistance" 
against an occupying force.  The steady draining of blood throughout the 
century in the Third World has been due to a large extent to some form or 
other of "people's war" - although traditional Western political theory would 
characterize most of these conflicts as civil war.  

<p>
To a great extent these two paradigms of warfare are skew to each other.  
Nowhere was this more apparent than in the US involvement in Vietnam, where 
each side was pursuing a different ideal type of warfare, and at the same 
time each was being forced into a third, older type of warfare (positional 
warfare of maneuver) from time to time.

<p>
If technology develops to the point where reliable, effective robotic 
ground-based units are possible (before such things are made irrelevant by 
even more advanced forms of weaponry and warfare), one can see a projection 
of Billy Mitchell's Dream backward in time in a sense, into the doctrine of 
positional warfare of maneuver.  In such a situation, the kinds of political 
and military goals achievable by overwhelming technological superiority might 
well cause a real shift in the global balance of power - and possibly not a 
good one.  As it has turned out, the old paradigm of air power is primarily a 
defensive and reactive one.  "Robot armies" would be a much more effective 
tool of aggression... not a pleasant thought.
