Dear ___________,

<p>
I wish I knew your name -- your alias just doesn't fit a person of
your high intelligence, although it it consistent with your spelling.

<p>
Clarification: I was neither [1] promoting the conceptual content
of Nietzsche, nor [2] disparaging any spiritual practice.

<p>
Actually, however, I view Nietzsche's writings as "cultural criticism",
not as "metaphysics", and as such possessing considerable merit.
Further, I myself practice a non-ideological "spiritual" discipline.

<p>
My problem with the quotations is their vocabulary, and the metaphorical
 expression was meant to describe this vocabulary as
decadent if not altogether moribund.  Greg Burch and I were just
discussing the need for a new semantics of artistic creativity and
criticism for the coming Millennium.

<p>
For example, I could regard the term "sin" as "quaint" were it not
for the repulsive connotations it has acquired over the years.  The
association of "sin" with "Sheol" (which today would refer to a
sanitary landfill or a settling tank for human excrement), the intrinsic
sadomasochism of the evolved usage of the concept of "hell" (c.f.
"celare", "kalyptein") -- such terms are, in my view, anachronistic to
say the least. I put the word "spiritual" within quotation marks
because I also find its acquired burden of connotations distasteful.
I'm sure I would be misunderstood if I used "pneumatic" instead.

<p>
I certainly apologize if you experienced my post as a demeaning and
<a name="1943qlink1">disrespectful reference to your belief-system,</a>

<p>
Bob
