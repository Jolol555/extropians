But John, he *did* show that it did, whereas you are just asking us to take 
your word</a> for
<br>
<a name="3818qlink3">it.  I am willing to believe that you are honest about your internal 
impressions, but I can
<br>
show you a common optical chart on which you will see dots that do not 
exist.  Your internal
<br>
impressions of the dots will be there, but the dots will not.  A great deal 
of what we</a> all

<a name="3818qlink4">experience internally is constructed by lower layers to seem real, but is 
just a fill-in

shortcut.

Sometimes, like when that car is about to run you over, the filters will 
drop out and you can
<br>
get the full bandwidth.  It makes time seem to move very slowly, and you do 
not feel that you
<br>
are thinking, just watching.  You can't think in this mode because too much 
data is flowing
<br>
through, so we have filters to chunk and simplify the input.  With 
meditation it is possible
<br>
to turn these off at will, but usually for only a short time, and it is an 
effort.  If you
<br>
take some LSD the world will change around you; direct electrical 
stimulation of the brain
<br>
will do the same.  The point is, your internal observations are one of your 
least trustworthy
<br>
sources of information.</a>
