<p>
Visions of the future from some of the world's greatest thinkers paint a 
dismal picture for the inhabitants of Earth in the next millennium, with 
humans vying for supremacy with a new species of intelligent being. 
Predictions, a new book including contributions from such esteemed 
visionaries as sci-fi writer Arthur C Clarke and economist JK Galbraith, 
suggests that within two decades a new life form will have evolved from 
artificially intelligent machines. 


 
<p>
Telepathy promises to replace phones and faxes 
This development will occur "far more rapidly than biology will ever permit," 
reckons Clarke, author of 2001. 

<p>
With independent-minded machines threatening to leave us behind, the book 
predicts that humans will turn to genetics and computer implants in a bid to 
compete. 

<p>
Geneticist Dr French Anderson fears that, not content with curing all disease 
using gene-based treatments, people in the next millennium will attempt to 
<br>
<a href="0271.html#1912qlink1">"improve" themselves and their children. </a><br>

<p>
"Eugenics [might] be practised on a scale far larger than any 'selective <br>
breeding' policy could accomplish." 

<p>
The end of sex

<p>
Couples will no longer have sex to reproduce, with individuals relying on 
sperm and egg banks instead. 

<p>
Cybernetics expert Kevin Warwick, who already has a chip in his arm to 
remotely operate doors and switch on his computer, predicts that similar 
implants will become commonplace. 


 
 
<p>
The time may come when such devices will make speech obsolete, with humans 
communicating to each other telepathically. 

<p>
Such developments could pose a real threat to our established notions of who 
we are. 

<p>
"A human brain is a stand-alone entity, guaranteeing a unique human <br>
identity," Warwick said. "But link a human brain via the internet to other 
brains, both human and machine, and what of the individual then?" 

<p>
The anthology of forecasts by 30 noted thinkers - including Umberto Eco and 
Richard Dawkins - does envisage exciting leaps forward in space travel. 

<p>
Prince in space

<p>
Arthur C Clarke even predicts that Prince Harry, youngest son of the Prince 
of Wales, will be the first royal to holiday among the stars. 

<p>
He also says that by 2057, a century after Sputnik was launched, man will 
stand on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. 

<p>
However, many of the great minds quizzed were less than positive about the 
prospects for the future. 


 
<p>
Space travel: taking chaos to the stars 
British scientist Susan Greenfield thinks the attention span of humans will 
be eroded to the point where we will become a "society of restless, 
unimaginative individuals". 

<p>
American feminist and historian Elaine Showalter suggests that future 
generations will be dogged by "new paranoias, new hysterias, new conspiracy 
theories and new imaginary diseases". 

<p>
Sian Griffith, the Times Higher Education Supplement journalist who edited 
Predictions, said lessons should be learned from the prophesies. 

<p>
"I get the sense from these predictions that there is a limited time span for <br>
human beings unless we change." 

<p>
"There's a sense that we'll be struggling all the time, trying to do new <br>
things, but with a sense of disaster looming." 

<p>
Humans: A lethal mutation

<p>
Linguist Noam Chomsky describes the human race as a "lethal mutation", 
acquiring in an evolutionary heartbeat the capacity to destroy ourselves and 
the other life forms which share our planet. 

<p>
"Perhaps it will find ways to contain its destructive impulses. A rational <br>
Martian spectator might not be sanguine about the prospects." 

<p>
Writing in the journal Nature, Arthur C Clarke says that alien civilisations 
should welcome the "annihilation" of the human race. 

<p>
He thinks that extra-terrestrial onlookers will be glad that our mishandling 
of technology may destroy us before we can cause havoc on a galactic scale.
