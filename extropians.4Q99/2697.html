I've thought about this a fair amount, especially given some of
Robin's comments on the importance of being first.

<p>
<a name="2709qlink2">Ok, lets assume that one of us is *first*.  So what?

<p>
I have had the opportunity over the last 12+ years, particularly the
last 2 years, to spend much of my time by myself.  I suspect this
would contrast significantly to most list members unless they are
living out in the woods someplace.  Many years ago, I also spent
some time in an isolation tank.  These types of experiences are
revealing (and almost required) for a proper discussion regarding
the situation of "being the first".  As a general comment on my
experiences, I would say that I suspect humans have relatively strong
drives for not being alone.</a>

<p>
<a name="2710qlink1">So, say the first person willing to risk it all, uploads, then monopolizes
all the computronium.  They are probably years away from striking up a
productive conversation with any other SIs (if they even exist)</a>
[with the caveat of course, that they aren't already "here"].

<p>
<a name="2752qlink1">So you are sitting there with 10^50+ Instructions Per Year doing *what*?</a>  

<p>
People such as Anders &amp; Robin have commented on all of the interesting
unsolved problems that you could devote your attention to, but what
is the point if you don't get to show the solutions to anybody?  Can pure
intellectual exercises keep you sane and interested enough to solve them?

<p>
My feeling is that being a "sole-occupant" SI is going to get very boring
very fast.  Either you tip over the edge into insanity, or you rip out
all the emotional drives and preprogrammed goals and become nothing but
an automaton (about as interesting as a washing machine with a lot more
capacity).

<p>
<a name="2752qlink2">The only thing that seems to make sense (since you have the capacity)
is to upload everyone (who wants to be uploaded).  Then it least things
are really interesting while everyone expands their capacity and the
politics of SI management come into existence and sort themselves out.

<p>
<a name="2709qlink3">I agree that this has the odor of being an altruistic "nice" idea.</a>
<a name="2709qlink4"><a name="2698qlink1">But, can anyone paint me a picture of themselves post-uploading with
clear descriptions of what they intend to do (potentially by themselves)
for the next trillion years?
