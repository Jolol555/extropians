Spike, with a giggle still pending in my gut, I tell you that the NSG email
addy is:
<br>
nsg-d@europe.std.com
<br>
nsg-d@world.std.com
<br>
And then there is my nano list at:

You may want to visit the Nanotechnology Timeline site by Sean Morgan.

You may also want to mention the most recent advances or news on the
nanoscale. For example:
<br>
*Nadrian Seemans nanorobitic arm built from synthetic dna:<br>

<br>
*On July 7, 1999, the American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science<br>
Policy News reported that "one area of research that is beginning to come in
for special interest from the White House and Congress is nanotechnology.

<br>
*Hewlett Packard presents their nanolab and with UCLA collaboration the<br>
self-assembled molecular logic gate (Teramac computer) that has been hailed
on the Web as a major advance in nanotechnology.

<br>
*Viola Vogel, associate professor of bioengineering at the University of<br>
Washington, uncovered the molecular switch operation while investigating
fibronectin, a molecule that plays a role in the cell binding functions of
living proteins.

Or to mine of course:

You may want to look at some of  these and summerize them into your timeline
for your group. I suggest you give them a little of your personal
evaluations as well.

Extropians!  Please help:  Ive been asked to give a talk on short notice,
(as in tomorrow evening) to an engineering society to which
I belong.
<br>
I decided to talk on nanotechnology.  The pitch is ready
except for a nanotech timeline.
<br>
What should I put in there?
<pre>
1959:   Feynmans talk Plenty of Room at the Bottom
1969:  Gina Miller is born
1986:  Engines of Creation by Drexler
1992:  Nanotechnology by Drexler
</pre>
<br>
<a name="2009qlink1">Nov 1999: Nanomedicine</a> by Freitas
<br>
etc.  What are the most important milestones?
Thanks!  I do appreciate the help.  I have a copies of
Nanotech, Engines and Nanomedicine at home.  Perhaps they
have timelines in there.  I would forward this on to the nanotech
group but dont know the address, and im at work..   spike
