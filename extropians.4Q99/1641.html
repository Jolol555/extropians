Its been years since I've been on the receiving end of a Usenet
News feed but this sounds interesting.  I've looked briefly at
Deja.com and it looks like the discussion may have some content
though it is now dominated by complaints &amp; questions regarding
SETI@home (IMO a pretty useless activity).

<p>
<a name="1642qlink2">The problem is that Deja is slow (and who wants the ads).
I'd prefer a standard news feed but my ISP (being a big
bureacratic telcom company) doesn't seem to have the newsgroup,
might not grant me access to their news server and will be
wonderfully slow (and probably ill-informed) in responding
to my queries on this topic.</a>

<p>
<a name="1642qlink3">The question is what to do?

<p>
Does anyone know of public/free NNTP servers that are relatively fast?</a>
Is there a "source" NNTP server for the SETI newsgroup(s)?

<p>
I've got rn, bnews &amp; cnews &amp; nntp but they are 5+ years old.
I can use got Netscape Messenger as a client anything better?
What is "state-of-the-art" now-a-days?

<p>
Also, if it is of use to people, I could arrange to setup
a free relay news server on "extropian" topics.  It would
be nice to accumulate a list of Usenet topics of interest
to extropians &amp; transhumanists and archive them in a single
place.  My ISP for example carried sci.nanotech but didn't
seem to have sci.longevity and had no messages in
bionet.molbio.ageing, so we may have to hunt around
for places that will serve up the various topics and
concentrate them in a single location.

<p>
Please copy either extropians@extropy.com or me directly with
any response.
