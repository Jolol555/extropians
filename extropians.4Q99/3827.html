<p>
In a nutshell, all heat is energy, but not all energy is heat.  Heat is
an abstract form of energy, rather arbitrarily defined.  Energy comes in
many different forms or manifestations, but on a fundamental level there
are only a very few basic forms of energy, as there are only a few
fundamental forces or fields.  Heat per se is not considered a
fundamental form of energy, as heat is defined in terms of kinetic energy
and electromagnetic energy.  Heat is the energy ascribed to a set of
material particles within a compact space due to the random motion of
those particles within the limited space, along with the kinetic energy
of the internal mechanical vibration within the structure of each of the
particles, along with the electromagnetic energy within the space and
material, some of which is the instant potential electromagnetic energy
of the excitation of the atoms, and some of which is the instant energy
of the electromagnetic flux within the space.  The heat energy of a block
of matter within a space is the sum of the kinetic energies of each of
its constituent particles, relative to the reference frame of the block
as a whole, plus the electromagnetic energy within the material and the
space.  Heat is diffused kinetic and electromagnetic energy within a
body, as opposed to the gross kinetic energy of the body in gross motion.
 Sometimes, though, a single particle in motion, such as an electron in a
CRT, is assigned a temperature based on its motion relative to a
reference frame external to the particle, though clearly, the electron
has no kinetic energy in its own reference frame.
