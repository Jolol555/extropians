<i>&gt; &gt; I for one think its not an extropic way. It is a transhumanist way. The</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; extropian one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<a name="0141qlink2">I don't care if half of the population is made up of busybody
tattletales who think this is a good thing. Tell me, how many of you
people actually care for the busybody tattltales you've met in your
life? None? Well, what you are talking about is making everybody hate
everybody, everybody afraid of everybody. Contrary to earlier comments
from Spike and den, it won't only be criminals who will be afraid of
observation, it will also be people trying to get out of bad
relationships being observed on by their tormentors, adding fuel to the
fire, and will likely increase domestic violence. It will also be
employees trying to go to interviews at potential new jobs, and having
their current employer observe this, which will obviously make the
situation difficult for those with abusive or overbearing 'empire
builder' type bosses.

<p>
Also, there will also be the current pariah of the moment, you know,
those people that the public opinion and media hysteria</a> sensationalizes
a fury of public hate for. If you think the system will not be abused by
people seeking to spy on and persecute the public pariah of the moment,
you are kidding yourself.
