Many (most?) philosophers act as though we've discovered nothing
about physics, biology,  logic, or computer science in the last 100 years,
perhaps 200, in fact some think nothing important has happened since

<a name="3768qlink3">Well yes but there is nothing unique in that, it need not have anything to do with
consciousness. I don't care what it is if you keep asking "why" after the statement
"X happened because of Z" you will after about 6 or 7 questions be talking about
quarks and the geometry of space- time, and after that all you can say is I don't know.</a>
