Had I but known.... When I worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
we scrapped a CDC 7600 supercomputer to make room on the floor for a Cray-YMP.
No one wanted it; the cost for electricity and maintenance was too high.
I have a souvenir memory board on my mantle.  It was large enough you could
have turned it into a small bedroom.

I want an Elecom 100.  It was the first minicomputer, selling for $100,000,
when the only alternative was in the millions.  One of my grandfather's 
inventions.  His company was undercapitalized, failed, and was bought by
Univac.

On a humorous note, some years ago a PC company offered to accept any 
computer as a trade-in towards one of their computers.  They received all
sorts of things, but lots of the small, wedge-shaped Timex-Sinclairs.  Someone
(John Dvorak?) was curious as to what the company did with these puny machines
they had received in trade.  So he asked.  Answer:  Doorstops.
