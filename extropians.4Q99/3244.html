<a name="3286qlink1">I've consistently sneered at cold fusion.  The thing that caught and kept my 
attention about this article was how the author showed that there is a 
community of people with relatively good credentials who continue to nag at 
the problem and who seem ready to admit that they can't seem to explain the 
phenomena they observe on an intermittent basis.</a>  I'd be ready to completely 
dismiss the whole phenomenon if there WAS some glib theory being offered to 
explain both why it works and why it doesn't.  Of course, I also wouldn't buy 
into any sort of "conspiracy" explanation for why the matter hasn't been 
pursued more vigorously.  In fact, I was impressed by how much money has been 
put into the research by reputable institutions over the last decade.  It 
just seems damned odd to me that the whole matter hasn't been completely put 
to rest one way or the other by now.
