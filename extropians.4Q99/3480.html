No, I'm always number-dropping on the list...

<a name="3557qlink1">If we assume 10^26 "operating" minds / 10^</a>10 people (allowing for some
growth in human population before we have uploads), that gives you
10^16 "running" copies.  Since memory capacity (particularly on
the really long photon loops) seems greater than "operating"
capacity (limited by the energy output of the sun unless star-lifting
is employed), I suspect you have some even greater number of backup
copies that are inactive.  That allows you to easily tolerate those
bad-hair days when an unobserved nanoprobe comes screaming through your
MBrain cluster depositing a significant fraction of its kinetic energy
(at even low speeds like 0.1 c thats a lot of kinetic energy) in the
midst of your computronium.

<p>
<a name="3557qlink2">Hmmmm... Perhaps thats yet another reason interstellar nanoprobe
colonization doesn't occur -- a shotgun blast of high velocity
nanoprobes through an MBrain makes quite a mess.  It doesn't
really damage them, but when they have to restore 10^12 "running"
copies from the backup storage, it gets them *really* pissed.</a>

<p>
They are going to want to know who sent out those nanoprobes without
looking where they were shooting.

<p>
Yep. Gets dicey though in determining who gets to decide what
is a "mistake" that you should erase...

<p>
<a href="3461.html#3480qlink3">&gt; Even so, 10^16 seems a tad excessive.  Would these copies be </a><br>
<i>&gt; dormant caches of data, or co-operating identities?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Could be "individuals" as we know them or a hive/borg-mind.
I suspect there are nested heirarchies of mind-units that have
different thought hold times (concentration times?) or 
perhaps as Ander's suggests, different memory accuracies and
retention strengths.
