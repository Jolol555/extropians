I take several nootropics regularly, and I really don't feel much smarter
because of them, but some of the things I use and do have been beneficial.

<p>
Piracetam seems to make me happier on the days I take it than I am on the
days I don't, but more subtly than st. john's wort.

<p>
By damping my physical fear response, propranolol helps me try scary things
without freaking myself out. I was more shy than you would probably believe
before I started using it.

<p>
I do several things to improve my memory. I want to have a good memory
because it is hard for me to believe I have a good life when I can't
remember the great experiences I have had, and that has been my condition
for a long while, I am afraid. Now I am starting to achieve my goal of
remembering my good experiences.

<p>
I take hydergine.

<p>
I keep an 11-year journal. It takes four lines a day, and at the end of
each month there is a place to write a two-word reminder of each day. Every
month I have been amazed at all the good stuff that has happened.

<p>
Now, I have never heard anyone else say this so maybe it is just me, but I
have a favorite recreational drug, and feeling happy from that drug reminds
me of other times I was happy so I remember some things that way. This is a
new idea from this month so I still intend to find a way to use this
systematically. That drug is GHB.

<p>
I like my life.
