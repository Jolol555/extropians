Eugene,

Yes, but... In case you did not receive my reply to Chuck
"To: Chuck Re: Making people passive NOT!" I will repeat it
here:

Chuck,

<p>
There is some justifiable doubt about what Hobbes actually meant
to say in Latin, but surely not "Man is a wolf to wolves." These are
the standard Latin and English expressions, but the Latin has evidently
 been corrupted.  I suppose I should have used the following
English statement to illustrate my point:

<pre>
                   "Human life in a state of nature (apart
                   from or before the institution of the
                   civil state) is a war of all against all."

</pre>
<p>
It was in this same discussion of the "Social Contract" that he gave
the famous description of human life apart from civilization as "nasty,
brutish and short".  These two statements are unequivocal.

<p>
Thank you for your reply,

<p>
Bob
