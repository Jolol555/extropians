Einstein's E=mc^2 'was Italian's idea' 

<p>
Rory Carroll in Rome 
<br>
Thursday November 11, 1999 

<p>
The mathematical equation that
<br>
ushered in the atomic age was
<br>
discovered by an unknown Italian
<br>
dilettante two years before Albert
<br>
Einstein used it in developing the
<br>
theory of relativity, it was claimed
<br>
yesterday. 

<p>
Olinto De Pretto, an industrialist
<br>
from Vicenza, published the
<br>
equation E=mc^2 in a scientific
<br>
magazine, Atte, in 1903, said
<br>
Umberto Bartocci, a mathematical
<br>
historian. 

<p>
Einstein allegedly used De Pretto's
<br>
insight in a major paper published
<br>
in 1905, but De Pretto was never
<br>
acclaimed, said Professor Bartocci
<br>
of the University of Perugia. 

<p>
De Pretto had stumbled on the
<br>
equation, but not the theory of
<br>
relativity, while speculating about
<br>
ether in the life of the universe, said
<br>
Prof Bartocci. It was republished in
<br>
1904 by Veneto's Royal Science
<br>
Institute, but the equation's
<br>
significance was not understood. 

<p>
A Swiss Italian named Michele
<br>
Besso alerted Einstein to the
<br>
research and in 1905 Einstein
<br>
published his own work, said Prof
<br>
Bartocci. It took years for his
<br>
breakthrough to be grasped. When
<br>
the penny finally dropped, De
<br>
Pretto's contribution was
<br>
overlooked while Einstein went on
<br>
to become the century's most
<br>
famous scientist. De Pretto died in
<br>
1921. 

<p>
"De Pretto did not discover<br>
<br>
relativity but there is no doubt that
<br>
he was the first to use the equation.
<br>
That is hugely significant. I also
<br>
believe, though it's impossible to
<br>
prove, that Einstein used De
<br>
Pretto's research," said Prof
<br>
Bartocci, who has written a book
<br>
on the subject. 

<p>
Einstein's theory held that time and
<br>
motion are relative to the observer
<br>
if the speed of light is constant and
<br>
if all natural laws are the same. A
<br>
footnote established the
<br>
equivalence of mass and energy,
<br>
according to which the energy (E)
<br>
of a quantity of matter (m) is equal
<br>
to the product of the mass and the
<br>
square of the velocity of light (c).
<br>
Now known as: E=mc^2 . 

<p>
The influence of work by other
<br>
physicists on Einstein's theory is
<br>
also controversial. A German,
<br>
David Hilbert, is thought by some to
<br>
have been decisive. 

<p>
Edmund Robertson, professor of
<br>
mathematics at St Andrew's
<br>
University, said: "An awful lot of
<br>
mathematics was done by people
<br>
who have never been credited -
<br>
Arabs in the middle ages, for
<br>
example. Einstein may have got the
<br>
idea from someone else, but ideas
<br>
come from all sorts of places. 

<p>
"De Pretto deserves credit if his<br>
<br>
contribution can be proven. Even
<br>
so, it should not detract from
<br>
Einstein."
