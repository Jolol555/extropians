New `smart sneaker' chip measures up kids

<p>
The latest sneaker technology from [Reebok International Ltd.] may not make
kids run faster, or jump higher.
<br>
But it will let them measure their performance.

<p>
Reebok's new Traxtar "smart shoes" for kids hit the shelves this Saturday.
The $55 and $65 sneakers use a computer chip and a motion sensor - along
with electronic beeps and flashing lights - to measure a child's sprinting
and jumping ability.

<p>
While video game designers use light and sound displays to keep kids on the
couch as long as possible, Traxtar is designed to inspire kids to get off
the couch, said Matt Feiner, a product director for the Stoughton shoe
maker. The company says it will ship between 25,000 and 50,000 pairs during
the holiday season, with more next year.

<p>
A motion sensor - the same kind of accelerometer used in airbags - along
with a microprocessor unit are enclosed in an oval module and attached to
the left tongue of the Traxtar shoe.

<p>
A youngster can test sprinting, long jumping or high jumping ability, with
accelerometer results given in scores that can be translated to standard
measurements using cards that come with the shoes.

<p>
Reebok developed the shoes with FitSense Technology of Wellesley, which has
supplied motion and temperature sensors used by Boston Marathoners.

<p>
FitSense also developed a sensor which was swallowed by John Glenn to
monitor his body temperature as he orbited earth during his Space Shuttle
mission.

<p>
John Horan with industry newsletter Sporting Goods Intelligence says it's
the first so-called smart technology to be incorporated into shoes, although
it may not be the last.

<p>
If Traxtar is a hit with kids, other sneaker makers are sure to offer their
own versions, he said. Feiner said there are "tremendous future
applications" for Reebok's adult shoes.

<p>
Reebok isn't the only shoemaker trying to create excitement in an industry
that has been flat.

<p>
[Converse Inc.] of North Reading recently launched shoes with helium
cushioning. [Nike Inc.]'s Web site allows customers to personalize shoes,
even by having their name stiched on them.

<p>
Last month Reebok launched a Traxtar.com web site, with space-age graphics,
games and information aimed at promoting the shoes and attracting kids.
