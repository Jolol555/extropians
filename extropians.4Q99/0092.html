Well said Jeff.  Me too.  {8^D  While discussing nanomachines with
<a name="0173qlink1">a group of coworkers today, I noticed they didnt seem to understand
my comment that we already *have* nanomachines running around in
our bodies, repairing damage, taking out harmful...foreign nanomachines.</a>

be made of silicon, like 7 of 9's.</a>  They thought there is something
different about carbon based microrganisms and a replicating
assembler.  Am I missing something,<a name="0173qlink3"> or is there some fundamental
