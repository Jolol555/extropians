<a href="1287.html#1554qlink2">&gt;I think incrementally ala the Moravec suggestion of neuron by neuron</a><br>
<i>&gt;functional replacement [inside-out replacement].  I do not see how this</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot work (given advanced technology) unless there is something very</i><br>
<i>&gt;unusual (magical) about neurons we currently don't understand.</i><br>

<p>
What noone here seems to understand is that the "mind" is much more than the 
wiring.  I'm not being mystical in the least.  There are entirely other 
processes at work in mental functioning besides neuron signal processing.  
The "meaning" of the signals itself is fed back into the net in a way 
</a>
virtually impossible to duplicate via any current computer technology.  I'm 
talking about hormones, thousands of different neurotransmitter and modifier 
substances, all of which are released both generally and in specific areas 
of the brain and are essential to mental focus, motivation and action.  The 
mind is not a logic engine; it is part of a living system.  Life has 
particular characteristics which are carried over into the structure and 
function of the mind.
<br>
Here is a kind of nightmare scenario that could - at least physically - 
happen:  The boomers keep replacing parts of the nervous system 
incrementally - optic processors with all sorts of neat new features like 
digital record/replay/edit/link - memory chips that can record synatic 
patterns in general and reinvoke or amplify weak ones via the neural 
interfaces like UCI is working on, etc.  Eventually, the logic and action 
are being carried out with expert system assists - why spend years learning 
Kung Fu when for a few digicredits you can download it?  As the wetware gets 
more and more decrepit and more and more functions are taken over by faster, 
smarter hardware, nobody notices that the PEOPLE are disappearing and what 
we're ending up with is more than perfect emulation Stepford Boomers.  But 
these new "people" aren't people at all.  They have no actual consciousness, 
just fast software Elizas all analyzing each other - i.e., Super-Yuppies 
(had to throw that in).
