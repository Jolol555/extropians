<p>
Consider gas.

<p>
<a name="1703qlink1">Boyle's  Laws and like that.  When gas is heated in a closed container the 
pressure increases.  Now why....fundamentally.....at the molecular 
level....is that?  Well the way I understand it is that the velocity of the 
individual gas molecules increases....which thru a chain of events exerts  
more pressure on the containment walls.</a>

<p>
<a name="1702qlink1">To cut to the chase....somehow by applying heat to gas... velocity is 
imparted to individual molecules.</a> 

<p>
<a name="1702qlink2">I may be missing something here....but where is the "for every action there 
is an equal and opposite reaction".</a>   

<p>
<a name="1703qlink2"><a name="1702qlink3">Even if i'm not missing something......&lt;great leap&gt;....suppose that all of 
the gas molecules could be coaxed to go in the same direction? (Campbell's 
"Mightiest machine(?)" &lt;early sixties?&gt;)
</a>

<p>
So if a gadget (with all kinds of neat magnetic fields and primary and 
seconday windings and multicolored flashing lights) could be developed that 
</a>
would convince all the gas in a container that they should go in ONE 
direction when heated......wouldn't that be a reactionless drive?

<p>
So what has that to do with the real world?

<p>
Methinks that as the purity of materials increases (via drextech) that 
certain insignificant physical effects might become more significant.  Silly 
things like......quantum tunneling, direct conversion of stress (piezo) heat 
or light to electricty...and others....

<p>
Isn't this fundamental to transistors?  The migration of a "hole" ....and 
thence IC's?

<p>
<a name="1703qlink3">So the point I'm speculating about....perhaps there will be some other 
effects of drextech ......really soon now.</a>
