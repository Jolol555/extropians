<p>
I think Eliezer (in this post and the previous[?] one) has correctly
interpreted the point I was trying to make.

<p>
However Natasha's point is valid as well.

<p>
On a good day, when I learn about protein inteins &amp; exteins (protein
splicing along the lines of RNA splicing ["Making the Cut", Science
News Oct. 2, 1999, pgs 222-223] and an organism like Synechocystis 
that has to do protein splicing of two different "half"-genes to
get a functional DNA Polymerase (necessary for replication), I think
***wow*** this is really cool, I don't want to miss any of this.

<p>
On a bad day, when I Obi Wan Burch tries to beat into my head
how formidable the Genetic Luddites are and I spend most of the
day wrestling with Perl regular expression parsing and backtracking
trying to understand how it really works (in contrast to the
impressions that the documentation or manuals would lead you
to believe); I wonder whether it is really worth all the trouble.

<p>
As Natasha points out (indirectly), it would be so much easier to simply
freeze myself and wait until it all turns out.   If Robin is right,
and I put myself on the short list for reanimation I might come out
at the head of the pack.  If I don't then presumably there will be
someone more prudent behind me.  In either case this strategy
has the advantage of avoiding the luddite wars and endless amounts
of frustration associated with learning new command &amp; control
languages.

<p>
The problem is that I really don't know what to do when the 
"good" days and the "bad" days *are* the *same* day.

<p>
As you can probably tell, its been a long day.
Robert
