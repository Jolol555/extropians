Billy Brown made a number of good points in rebuttal:

<p>
<a name="1778qlink1">Good deal!  If they are ready in 10-20, that fits my definition of
"threshold of a dream."  We will never see anything like the horrifying
first world war again.   Huge armies are more of a liability than an asset.
Infantry would be a special team of highly trained</a> people with lotsa
<a name="1778qlink2">high tech gear and an intense focus.</a>

<p>
<a href="1685.html#1752qlink3">&gt; The ability to bomb enemy leaders is not the same as the ability to kill</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1778qlink3">Ja.  What I have in mind is surgical damage to the enemy infrastructure,
that disables communication, command and control, in such a way that
repair is easy after the short war is over.</a>  When all is said and done, a
war could conceivably be fought with few or perhaps no casualties.

<p>
Consider the threads that were going around here six months ago
regarding planes dropping a webby substance, and some were
arguing about what it could be.  Turns out it was carbon filaments,
dropped in exploding cannisters that would drift down and short
out power lines.  Now *thats* my kinda war!

<p>
<a name="1903qlink1"><a href="1685.html#1752qlink4">&gt; Planes cannot capture terrain, they can</a><br>
<i>&gt; only weaken an enemies ability to resist.  Open terrain can be taken by</i><br>
<i>&gt; armored forces...that means infantry remain essential even in a modern army.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1778qlink4">This *assumes* terrain must be taken and held.  Of course this is the
way it has *always* been done, but I urge you to ask yourself why
exactly this is necessary.</a>  I can imagine many scenarios in which a
technologically advanced society<a name="1778qlink5"> could get its way, while allowing
the adversary to keep all their terrain, even allow it to imagine itself as
having won the war, yet stop whatever behaviour that we found
</a>
objectionable to start with.

</a>
<p>
Since the *real* currency of our times is information, the whole notion
of capturing dirt seems absurd.<a name="1778qlink6">  Please someone more advanced
</a>
than me, chip in here and extrapolate forward.  spike
