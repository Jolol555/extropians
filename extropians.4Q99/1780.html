(concerned about health risks with sucrose?

<UL>
  <li>  try inositol as a sweetener instead.)

Abstract
<br>
  The potential activities of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), myo-inositol,
  curcumin, esculetin, resveratrol and lycopene-enriched
  tomato oleoresin (LTO) as chemopreventive agents against lung tumor induction
  in A/J mice by the tobacco smoke carcinogens benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and
  4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) were evaluated. Groups
  of 20 A/J mice were treated weekly by gavage with a mixture of BaP and NNK (3
  micromol each) for 8 weeks, then sacrificed 26 weeks after the first
  carcinogen treatment. Mice treated with BHA (20 or 40 micromol) by gavage 2 h
  before each dose of BaP and NNK had significantly reduced lung tumor
  multiplicity. Treatment with BHA (20 or 40 micromol) by gavage weekly or with
  dietary BHA (2000 ppm), curcumin (2000 ppm) or resveratrol
<br>
  (500 ppm) from 1 week after carcinogen treatment until termination had no<br>
  effect on lung tumor multiplicity. Treatment with dietary myo-inositol
<br>
  (30,000 ppm) or esculetin (2000 ppm) from 1 week after carcinogen treatment<br>
  until termination significantly reduced lung tumor multiplicity, with the
  effect of myo-inositol being significantly greater than that of esculetin.
  Treatment with dietary LTO (167, 1667 or 8333 ppm) from 1 week before
  carcinogen treatment until termination had no effect on lung tumor
  multiplicity. The results of this study demonstrate that BHA is an effective
  inhibitor of BaP plus NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice when
  administered during the period of carcinogen treatment and that, among the
  compounds tested, myo-inositol is most effective after carcinogen treatment.
