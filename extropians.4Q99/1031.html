<a href="1021.html#1031qlink1">&gt;A happily married man, for example, might take up with prostitutes &gt;and </a><br>
<i>&gt;start bouncing checks.</i><br>

<p>
I'm starting to hate playing Devil's Advocate but I think it's necessary.

<p>
Are you certain this person was, in fact, happily married?  Did the accident 
change him emotionally?  That would account for the prostitutes and the 
bounced checks.  Not cairing to balance the check book (or remembering to), 
he decides prostitutes are more fun that his wife, etc.

<p>
Here's what I think.  Since the frontal lobe is responsible for reasoning, 
and my hypothesis is it does this through association of connected memories, 
then when this part of the brain is damaged new associations are made by 
crossing wires so to speak.  This part of the brain still works the same 
way, but a new philosophy has been programmed in his mind.  This could 
effect him emotionally (by associating emotional memories with other random 
memories) and cause him to act irrationally (his "social norm" programming 
has been rewritten by crossed wires).  Cognitive therapy would be the easy 
fix for this.  It's long and tedious but all you need to do is create new 
associations to override the new programming.  I think I wrote about this 
ineptly a few weeks back.

<p>
Any way, that's what I'm writing about in my book "Consciousness as a Widely 
Distributed 'I'".  Of course I don't hold any degrees so probably noone will 
take me seriously but I'm writing it anyway.
