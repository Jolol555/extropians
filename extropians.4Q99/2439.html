<a href="2436.html#2439qlink1">&gt; A certain man asked the famous Mulla Nasrudin, "What is the</a><br>
<i>&gt; meaning of fate, Mulla?" Mulla replied, "Assumptions." "In what</i><br>
<i>&gt; way?" the man asked again.</i><br>

<p>
A priest asked: What is Fate, Master? 

<p>
And he answered: 
<br>
It is that which gives a beast of burden its reason for existence. It
is that which men in former times had to bear upon their backs.  It is
that which has caused nations to build byways from City to City upon
which carts and coaches pass, and alongside which inns have come to be
built to stave off Hunger, Thirst and Weariness.

<p>
And that is Fate? said the priest. 

<p>
<a name="2450qlink1">Fate ... I thought you said Freight, responded the Master.</a> 

<p>
That's all right, said the priest. 
<br>
I wanted to know what Freight was too.
