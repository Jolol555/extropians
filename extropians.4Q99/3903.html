<a name="3908qlink1">Hello, I am new to the list and have been following the discussion on "qualia" or is that Qualia?</a>  I am a little confused in regards to what exactly a "qualia" is, and was wondering if anyone would be able to recommend any reading material to further illuminate the term.

<p>
Also, Dan, I was wondering if you could enlighten me as to the functional differences between Emotion and "emotion" or Experience and "experience" etc.  As well, you mentioned in one of your earlier posts that you had a complete philisophical system that had us all as zombies and remained internally consisten, is this something you have down in writing, something that you could e-mail to me.  I would be very interested in reading it.

<p>
Thank you
