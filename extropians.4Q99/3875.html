<p>
Robert Bradbury probably made that panel "sweat" because Robert is broadly
intelligent and informed about an array of technologies/sciences pertaining
to superlongevity.  I think this is why the author of the article mentioned
extropians in this light.  At first blush one might one fully comprehend
what is being said, but I believe it is complimentary of Robert.  Did you
know that Susan Sontag (famed critic of the 1960s and about to make headway
again in a book by Annie Lebowitz) was once said to "make coffee nervous"?
:)

Flynts! 

<p>
Here again, another inside "Wired" comment.  At Extro3, the editor of one
of Larry Flynt's publication was in the audience.  I've been to Hugh
Hefner's mansion (the zoo was really spectacular.  The women were beautiful
and the men gorgeous but conversation was lacking) and to Larry Flynt's
offices (excessively ornamented with carpets, gigantic vases, and huge
paintings with elaborate gold frames).

<p>
<a href="3824.html#3875qlink3">&gt;  I'd rather be a Hugh Hefner.</a><br>

<p>
I'll take the animals, a Persian carpet, but I'd still rather be an
Extropian! 

<p>
Cheers!
