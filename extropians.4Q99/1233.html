Here is one translation of Chapter 1 of the "Tao Te Ching":

<p>
Tao means how: how things happen, how things work.
Tao is the single principle underlying all creation.
Tao cannot be defined, because it applies to everything.
You cannot define something in terms of itself.
If you can define a principle, it is not Tao.

<p>
Tao is a principle. Creation, on the other hand, is a process.
That is all there is: principle and process, how and what.
All creation unfolds according to Tao. There is no other way.

<p>
Tao cannot be defined, but Tao can be known. The method
is meditation, or being aware of what is happening. By being
aware of what is happening, I begin to sense how it is happening.
 I begin to sense Tao. To become aware of what is
happening, I must pay attention with an open mind. I must
set aside my personal prejudices or bias. Prejudiced people
see only what fits those prejudices.

<p>
The method of meditation works; principle and process are
inseparable. All process reveals the underlying principle. This
means that I can know Tao.
