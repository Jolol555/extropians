No profound, eppiphanies for me, Hal. Although in my twenties I became aware 
of how much time passed and how weird it seeemed, and how it would be 
'someday'  when my parents would be 'gone'.  I wonder what brain function 
best explain's your childhood experiences?  
As I lurk on the MWI list, I occasionally watch for comments regarding 
post-mortem survival-so far nothing beyond Tegmark's conjecture.  I am 
interested in the re-caluclation of the human states of being by a vast 
super-computing intelligence; in the deep future. Even more compelling (for 
me), is reading some of Clifford Pickover's researchers, in his fantasy 
+science book, called "Time."
