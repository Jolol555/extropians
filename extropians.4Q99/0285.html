<p>
    I agree with Muse's point that it is behavior that needs moderation and 
not topics.  I believe that there should be some standards for civil 
discourse.  There is a difference between saying things to make a point and 
saying things to intentional harm or denigrate another person.  Granted, 
there is sometimes a fine dividing line between the two, but the line, in my 
opinion, is there none the less.  Without going into names, I will say that I 
have had pretty reasonable and fruitful discussions with a couple of the 
people whose names have been brought up as particular examples of poor 
behavior, so I know that they are capable of logical discourse.  I would ask 
that any of you who have been accused of causing problems take a moment, step 
back from the fray, and look at what you've been doing and saying.  While I 
respect your right to your opinions, and your right to defend yourselves, 
have you really been doing it in the most productive of ways?  A good debate 
should pull people into the topic, not drive them away.  Again I emphasize, I 
have no personal charges to make, as I have felt that I have been reasonably 
dealt with by-and-large personally, but I can't help but notice that there 
have been inappropriate postings to others (though have not followed this 
closely enough to assign particular blame, nor do I feel it would be 
productive to do so at this time).  

<p>
    As for those who have been offended, or have been part of discussions 
where offensive discussions have occurred, do not let it go by unchallenged, 
but also do not fan the flames.  I would suggest that when someone posts 
something you believe inappropriate, it should be politely brought to that 
person's attention (don't activate any memetic defenses by accident).  If the 
<a name="0321qlink1">person doesn't recognize the problem and it persists, then we need to take 
action as a community to deal with it.  Do not answer inappropriate posts, 
ask for the person's offending posts to be removed from the list.</a>  

<p>
    One of the things I value most about these lists is the chance to have 
free wheeling conversations which are critically evaluated in an intelligent 
manner.  Let's grow that, not stunt it.
