It hasn't begun yet.

<a name="0534qlink1">I was very surprised to see Eliezer say "what history?"  And then Anders 
reply "it hasn't begun yet".  While certainly extropianism has not yet found 
its place in the annals of history and still has much to do there can be no 
doubt that it does have a history.</a>

<p>
<a name="0534qlink2">Natasha-Vita More's book "Create/Uncreate" discusses the history of 
transhumanism and extropianism</a> and she is the first great historian of the 
movement in my view.  Just because books on the  history of extropianism are 
not on bestseller lists or because it is not in the textbooks of school kids 
does not mean extropianism does not have a history.

<p>
It will be interesting to see in the next four decades or so of my life how 
this movement grows and develops.  Should I be successfully reanimated from 
cryonic suspension I will be very interested to know how the Cryonics 
Institute of the late 21st century is doing.

<p>
And should I be reanimated before Max and Natasha I would expect to see 
quite a media event when they are brought back should the EI become 
prominant as I expect it to be.  I can imagine quite a welcome back party 
for them.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
