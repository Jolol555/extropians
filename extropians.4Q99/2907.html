Good point!  These are some of things we discussed in the last spat of
posting on this topic.  I would imagine some of the previous structure would
be maintained.  It would kind of be pointless to just create humans, since
there's an easier way to do that.:)

<p>
One of the concerns voiced previously.  If a species which is carnivorous is
uplifted, it might see humans as competition.  Of course, this might be more
of a nuisance than a bona fide threat.

<p>
<a name="2957qlink1">The lifespan issue is very important too.  It might be considered cruel to
uplift a creature that can only live such a brief life.  (This might be
subjective, but I think a life span of three years is too short.  Heck, I'm
interested in immortality just like most</a> of you.:)

Cheers!
