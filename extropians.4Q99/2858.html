Octopodes is the plural of octopus.  It is a Greek plural -- not Latin.

<p>
I suggest it for several reasons which I outlined about two years ago in the
previous uplifting discussion.  I would also mention, since there is no sure
fire way right now to tell how long it will take to get serious IA, AI, or
(M)NT from speculation to production that this kind of bioengineering
project, with much more clearly defined starting and endpoints, might result
in the kind of thing Vernor Vinge proposed in his _A Fire Upon the Deep_.
This is that the canine-like race of collective minds would benifit from
exposure to two alien races -- humans and scroders -- as opposed to one.

<p>
An uplifted octopus mind would probably be very different from a human one -
provided the project didn't just mean putting human brains in octopodes
bodies.:)

<p>
One other point, I don't think these things necessarily compete with each
other.  Uplifting, IA, AI, MNT are not in a race to see which gets to the
finish line first and takes all the prizes.:)  (Surely, in some way, there
is competition.  Time spent studying prosody -- I'm currently reading _Meter
in English: A Critical Engagement_:) -- is time not spent studying MNT, AI,
IA, uplifting, etc.  But in the wider scheme of things, I don't think if
someone decides to uplift some other species this is going to monopolize all
the resources (minds, money, etc.) so that nothing else gets done.

<p>
And,  in some way, uplifting and IA go together.  Uplifting is, after all, a
kind of IA, though for nonhumans.

<p>
Cheers!
