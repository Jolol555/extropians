I've never read about this study but can verify the acuracy of the 
information.  I was institutionalized for 3 years, because MY MOTHER had 
mental problems.  Here is a list of some of the medications I had been 
prescribed and forced to take (please disregard my spelling mistakes) 
ridilan, thorzine, tegretal, lythium (caused an outbreak of psoriasis), 
clonodine, cogentine, haldol, and several others I can't remember at the 
moment.  My diagnoses were always changing, here are a few.  Multiple 
Personality Disorder (ruled out within a few weeks though), Associative 
Disorder, Identity Disorder, Attention Deficet Hyperactivity Disorder, 
hallucinates (Total bullshit), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Anxiety 
Disorder, brain seizers, and other diagnosis.  At the end of 3 years my 
insurance ran out and I was finaly released.  I was completly normal up 
until they wanted to give me drugs, which of course I refused, then when 
they brought out the needle I broke one nurses rib, and gave another a 
concussion (I was 12).  Afterwards I continued to refuse medication and they 
continued to attempt to restrain me and inject me with medication and I 
continued to severly hurt them.  Consequently I was moved to more and more 
secure facilities (uncontrollable environments causing high stress) and I 
continued to act out more as a result.  At this time (15 years old) I've 
learned to change the appearance of my personality on command and judge 
other peoples personality with great accuracy.  I underwent several CAT 
Scans, MRIs, EKGs, and other tests.  My IQ and other cognitive abilities 
were also constantly tested.  Funny, the day I was released I became 
completely normal again.  I continued to refuse medication (haven't taken a 
single pill, not even tylenal since) and have been just fine.  No voices, no 
explosive outbursts, no personality changes (except by experiment which I 
still continue to perform), and attention problems, completely normal.  My 
reason for bringing this up.  These doctors need to get their shit straight! 
  I never wanted their help, never asked for it, they shouldn't have tried.  
Who are they to think they're better than me?  To think they know better 
than I do?  To say my philosophy is wrong?

<p>
That's where my philosophy comes from.  Don't help anyone unless they ask 
for it because your subjective philosophy is no better than any other 
subjective philosophy.  All moral philosophy is subjective even if based 
from evolution, socialogy, or whatever, for morals are "what should bes" and 
not "what is".
