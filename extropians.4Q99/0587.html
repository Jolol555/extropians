More specifically we were talking about educating children.  Most people do
not send their children to school, most children are sent to school by the
government.  Whether this makes a parent happy or not I do not know.  The
idea that the average person can afford to send their child to school to
simply make themselves feel happy is false.

<a name="0621qlink1">Maybe I wasn't quite clear on this point, I'm talking about private
education in the absense of any sort of state funding.  The money paid for
the childs education would be an investment and the return on that
investment would be based on the childs future earnings.
