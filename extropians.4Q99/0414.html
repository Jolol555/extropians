<p>
(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS -- As University of Minnesota President Mark Yudof
highlighted a year of progress in his State of the University address last
Thursday, an outspoken student took a view contrary to the president's and
publicly voiced his discontent.

<p>
During the question and answer portion of the address, graduate student Drew
Hempel questioned Yudof directly about the University's involvement in
genetic engineering.

<p>
Hempel said the University is out of line in continuing research into
genetic engineering of crops without full knowledge of the problems and
benefits it might bring. Hempel also distributed about 40 copies of the
<br>
"Dis-orientation Report," a self-published paper alleging University abuse<br>
of power and funding.

<p>
"I disagree with your premise, and I disagree with your conclusion," Yudof<br>
said then. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

<p>
Gary Muehlbauer, a wheat and barley molecular biologist who works as a
genetic engineer for the University, said the University is an acknowledged
leader in the field.

<p>
While he thinks care must be exercised in the area of genetic engineering,
he does not support postponing research in the field.

<p>
"I think in certain cases genetic engineering can be very useful. We do have<br>
to take some time and decide where it will help and where it will hurt,"
Muehlbauer said.

<p>
The British Medical Association recently called for a moratorium on
genetically engineered crops, which Hempel highlighted by carrying a sign
advertising the decision.

<p>
"Over 237 countries have called for a ban on genetic engineering, but, for<br>
some reason, the University has taken it upon itself to be a leader in the
field," Hempel said.

<p>
Research persists at the University -- as opposed to most European
countries, where the practice has been halted -- because of large private
donations by corporations, Hempel said.

<p>
In September, the University received a $10 million gift from Cargill for a
microbial and plant genomics facility.

<p>
"Basically, public universities have become extensions of large<br>
corporations. They donate $50 million biotech centers so they can get free
research and then wait for the patents. They can't stop without giving the
money back," Hempel said. "The University is a public, nonprofit
organization. It should be democratic and operate toward the public good.
This hasn't happened in this case."

<p>
Harvey Sarles, a professor in cultural studies and comparative literature
who attended the address, said that while he disagreed with Hempel's methods
to attract attention, he did agree with some of his message.

<p>
"There is room for criticism of genetically engineered foods. Europeans, in<br>
particular, are rejecting the idea and refusing to buy our genetically
engineered crops," Sarles said.

<p>
Sarles agreed that the University should slow down its research until the
positives and negatives of the process and its product can be sorted out.

<p>
"It involves quite a lot of money," Sarles said. "I'm not sure we shouldn't<br>
go ahead, but there needs to be more discussion on the subject. If
protesting the address leads to that, then I guess a goal was accomplished."
