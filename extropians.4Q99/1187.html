Tao ofPhysics, has very little to do with Taoism *or* Physics. I read part of 
it and had the same reaction. It was fun, but not very plausable.

<p>
<a name="1221qlink1">Here;s waht I know about the subject ( which ain't much)
Taoists are not under any sort of direction from "god", for one thing, do not 
have a concept of "god" the word Tao means the  "way"  - which to my 
understanding is the "integrated" path, or a totality of being. The 
<br>
"universe", if you like. It cares little for humankind, unlike dieties who <br>
are  known to be meddling, punishing, or loving... the 'way' is aloof from 
us, yet we find more harmony when try to act in accordance with it... like 
not fighting reality -- not going upstream, or  something like that. It is 
not a very familiar thing to my Western mind. But it is from Taoism that we 
get the meme "go with the flow" and " follow the path of least resistance".</a>

<p>
On another note. I heard a good phrase at the secular humanists meeting once. 
They spoke of openly protecting Atheist beliefs (it was in regards to 
education) also --- "uncertain diests"  ; - )  -- meaning the large segment 
of the population who 'feel' that there *could* be some sort of creator, but 
have no idea what it might be, and are not intersted in classifying it.
