 animals, and they must be shown that *you* are the alpha, and that
 if you want his bone, then too bad for him.  I had dobermans [dobermen?]
 and they had to be beta-ized occasionally.  This is done most
 effectively by growling and baring teeth at them.  They *will* back
 down.  Really.

Okay, I did also stare him down a few times&lt;sg&gt;.  I don't think the growling 
and baring of teeth is all that necessary, just the ability to show that you 
will not be cowed without making the animal feel it has to attack.
