<a name="0609qlink1"><a name="0601qlink1">The Standard Diagnostic Nomenclature of the American Psychiatric
Association includes in its description of "sociopathy" "the inability
to experience shame or guilt" and "the absence of internalized
ethical or moral standards of conduct", i.e. conscience, and in
general "displays an amorphous hostile disregard of society".</a></a>

<p>
<a name="0601qlink2">So I use the term WITH reference to its MEANING; my opinions
have nothing at all to do with.  This is not to assert that
"sociopaths" are "bad"; it is to say they have a personality
disorder.</a>

<p>

<p>
Do it all the time -- my Board of Directors considers me their "servant";
anyone who serves anything -- a cause, the welfare of a child or spouse,
an organization etc. is a "servant".  The pejorative connotation you
attribute to this term represents your interpretation, not mine.

<p>
<a name="0601qlink3">Are you really that uncomfortable with the idea devoting your life,
even sacrificing it if necessary, to an Ideal or Purpose whose value
and importance vastly exceed your own?</a>

<p>
<a href="0590.html#0597qlink3">&gt; &gt;And one very good way to receive this enhancement of self-esteem is, when</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;appropriate, to subordinate your own needs to the welfare of others whose</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;lives might contain less "quiet despair", and more faith in themselves,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more hope for a better future, as a result of your effort</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If that works for you.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0601qlink4">I'm suggesting it works for everybody.  For example, devoted
Extropians are working hard not just for themselves but for
all "incarnations" of Reason (c.f. the Greek "logos" which was
interpreted by John and to some extent Plotinus as denoting
"The Word" but in fact means "pattern", "order" and "Reason"
or "ratio" in Latin).  As a future-oriented group of people, they
know that the possibility of incompletion of the program within
their own lifetimes is very real--but that does not deter them
from "serving the cause".  Perhaps I ought to say that I assume
so, because I cannot speak for anyone but myself.</a>

<p>
<a href="0590.html#0597qlink4">&gt; &gt;extropians in your membership who have not emotionally matured beyond the</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;primary narcissism of a three year old?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Robert, I would appreciate it if you didn't resort to name calling when</i><br>
<i>&gt; dealing with such important disscussions.  They don't contribute.</i><br>

<p>
I agree with you in this case; NOT WHAT I said, but the WAY I said it
was spoken in anger, for which I certainly apologize. What I ought to
have said was something like:

<pre>
<a name="0601qlink5">             "...who have not emotionally developed beyond that
             phase which Sigmund Freud called "Primary Narcissm",
             the earliest state except for "Oceanic Feelings of
             Omnipotence" which precedes</a> it."

Thanks for your reply,
