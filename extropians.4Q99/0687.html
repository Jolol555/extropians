<p>
  This is a great idea, up until the arguments against religion.  First
of all, parents have every right to have a say in their child's
education even if you think it's the wrong ideas.</a>  Although I'm just as
<a name="0793qlink2">against religion as most people on the list I don't think even
rationally bashing religion is called for.  We have a separation of
church and state, and teaching or bashing religion has no place in a
publicly funded school.</a>

  Who's funding this money?  I certainly hope it's not the government.</a>

<p>
  Again, who's funding the money?  I'd love to see the cryonics field
get the billions of dollars it so deserves, but I'd rather do it without
a huge tax increase.</a>  And I'd rather do it without stealing the money

  Where's the money gonna come from to fix or upgrade the automations

<p>
  This idea is just plain crazy. What happens to the great tiered voting
system when there aren't any more taxes like you said above?</a>  Who gets
<a name="0793qlink10">to decide who's ideas or whatnot "contributes" the most to society, how
to do you in tier when the tier's haven't been defined yet.</a>

<p>
  Your whole plan is absurd.  Money comes out of no where, people's
freedoms are destroyed just so you can get your "right" ideas to be in
the mainstream, and millions of hard working people get on the dole
provided by the few addicted and exploited.

<a name="0793qlink11">  <li>  How about instead we teach children critical rationalism, self
worth, and rewarding them for their hard work.</a>

possible and instead promote special interest organizations that we can
freely choose to donate our money</a> to.

<a name="0793qlink13">  <li>  I'm sure a lot of other Extropian's will disagree with me here but I
don't agree with an eye for an eye punishment.  I whole heartily agree
with self-defense.  If a person is met with force and if they choose
they have every right to respond by force.  Don't Extropian's champion
self transformation?  Wouldn't it be denying that person's right to
change by killing them after the crime?</a>  Sure the money has to be
<a name="0793qlink14">accounted for to pay for all this, but I'd rather be a cheap person
financially than a cheap and hypocritical person ethically by condoning
death sentencing.</a>  Of course this has and will continue to be a constant
debate.

<a name="0793qlink15"><a name="0688qlink1">  <li>  I'm quite skeptical about the whole "abolishment of work". 
Personally I think a world without work would be pretty boring,</a> I seem

deal of work needs some type of consciousness.  Something that can
create, explore possible solutions, and employ creativity to solving
