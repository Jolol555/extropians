<a name="1944qlink1">Yeah, this is like the research done by such Smolin, Linde, and Witten, also 
Max Tegmark. Now as far as such atoms forming a future plasma eventuating in 
a Uber Mind; that would be Tipler and Dave Deutsch's specialty. None of these 
scientists I have mentioned have suggested the eternal return.</a>  So Herr 
Neitzsch's eternal return doesn't cut it for me.  Or to quote Andrew 
Kurzweil, "whatever the physical law happens to be, it crumbles in the face 
of intelligence".  However, the realm of philosophy is like a smorgasboard; 
take your pick.
