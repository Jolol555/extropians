I suspect that Heinlein and Smith are high on the list of most list
subscribers. I have the good fortune to have an aunt who was a neighbor
of Heinlein as a child. When I was reading my first Heinlein book, (Star
Beast) in junior high she caught me at it, told me about her
relationship to him, and proceeded to describe what a sexist he was (my
aunt was a bit of a beatnik/flower child type, and is a teacher and NEA
member, of all things...;) ) as a result I was discouraged from reading
Heinlein for about 15 minutes.... ;)    At that age, I really enjoyed
the idea of divorcing one's parents, as one of the main characters in
the book did.

<p>
Personally, I think that L. Neil Smith's novel _Pallas_ is the modern
day _Atlas Shrugged_, only with a few less 20 page soliloquiys....
