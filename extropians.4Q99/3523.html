<a name="3698qlink1">Hmmm, Glen, Im glad your technique worked, but dogs</a> are pack
animals, and they must be shown that *you* are the alpha, and that
if you want his bone, then too bad for him.  I had dobermans [dobermen?]
and they had to be beta-ized occasionally.  This is done most
effectively by growling and baring teeth at them.  They *will* back
down.  Really.

<p>
Especially if you have big male dogs, you cant allow them to get
too high an opinion of themselves.  spike
