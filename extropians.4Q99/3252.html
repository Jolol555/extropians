it
<br>
<a href="2507.html#3252qlink2">&gt; has alot going for it!  "Star Trek" has shown not just this nation but the</a><br>

<p>
So.  I nowhere deny its influence, but this does not mean it's a great show
or that I have to like it.

<p>
<a href="2507.html#3252qlink4">&gt; And frankly while I am not the biggest fan of "Voyager" I did love "Deep</a><br>
<i>&gt; Space Nine" and really enjoyed the final season even if some called it</i><br>
world
<br>
<a href="2507.html#3252qlink5">&gt; war two in space.  I got to really care about the characters and did not</a><br>
<i>&gt; find them to be cardboard like with some science-fiction programs.</i><br>

<p>
Maybe so, though a lot of the stuff was only just above cardboard.

<p>
<a href="2507.html#3252qlink6">&gt; I do love "Babylon Five" and in some ways found it superior.  The aliens</a><br>
<i>&gt; were certainly generally more alien!  Though the Narn and the Centauri</i><br>
were
<br>
<a href="2507.html#3252qlink7">&gt; as "human" as Klingons and Romulans.  Also, sadly it is possible that B5</a><br>
is
<br>
<a href="2507.html#3252qlink8">&gt; a more realistic take on what the future may be life for humanity.  We may</a><br>
<i>&gt; not have a benevolent "Federation" to govern and protect us.  Humans may</i><br>
<i>&gt; very well not be dominant "big shot" race as as they appear to be in "Star</i><br>
<i>&gt; Trek."</i><br>

<p>
I agree.  I didn't like, however, that humans appeared for the most part to
be the peacemakers of the galaxy.  My bet would be if anything close to the
B5 universe existed -- and I highly doubt this; I like Sagan think any
contact between different sentient beings will not be between anything close
to the equality of B5, ST, Battlestar Galaxative -- I think humans would be
just another species.  Nothing special.  Unique in some respects, but not a
big deal to galactic culture and politics.

<p>
<a name="3284qlink1">We might perhaps start a thread on best portrayals of aliens in science
fiction.  My vote would probably go to some of Stanislaw Lem's novels.  Any
other Lem fans here?  (See my site for more on Lem.)</a>

<p>
<a href="2507.html#3252qlink9">&gt; To end my post I will make this statement...</a><br>
<i>&gt; "One thing in favor of "Star Trek, at least it wasn't "Battlestar</i><br>
<i>&gt; Galactica!" :)</i><br>

<p>
Good comments, but none of this makes me like "Star Trek.":)  Frankly, TV
science fiction as a whole is pretty lame.  I guess I shouldn't expect much,
as I have my tastes and chances are others who have similar tastes are just
not a big enough block for producers to take notice.

<p>
(We should also be careful here.  A lot of science fiction in print -- aside
from TV and film -- is garbage.  This should not be surprising.  This is so
with most things, I believe.  The good old 80/20 rule, I reckon.:/)

<p>
Cheers!
