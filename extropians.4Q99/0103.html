Machine demonstrates superhuman speech recognition abilities. University of
Southern California biomedical engineers have created the world's first
machine system that can recognize spoken words better than humans can. A
fundamental rethinking of a long-underperforming computer architecture led
to their achievement.

*3D circuits -- changing the shape of things to come. A new technology that<br>
allows 3-D electronic circuits to be moulded into plastic objects is set to
change the shape of tomorrow’s technology by allowing designers much greater
freedom and providing excellent weight and space savings. The technology,
being developed by Interconnection and Electronics Chemicals in the UK, can
be used to produce products that can be assembled with lower production
costs than using traditional technologies and are 100 per cent recyclable.

*Photons on Demand. 1 October 1999. Laser physicists are good at producing<br>
and manipulating single photons, but as with good comedy, the timing is
important. Even the best experiments in quantum cryptography and
computing--applications that make use of single photon properties--use
sources that emit photons at random times. In the 4 October PRL a French
team demonstrates a system that emits single photons on a dependable
schedule at a frequency of 3 MHz. One other "triggered" photon source which
operates on completely different principles was reported earlier this year.

If experiments at the University of California, Berkeley, are any

*Sniffing DNA may relieve asthma<br>
<br>
The Independent - LondonMILLIONS OF asthma sufferers could soon be using
inhalers filled with DNA from bacteria to relieve their symptoms, according
to a team of American scientists who have tested the system on mice. Such
inhalers could be ready within five years if the research proves effective
in humans. Mice that had been treated to give them asthma-like attacks
developed far less severe symptoms after inhaling DNA from bacteria. Most
present treatments for asthma focus on reducing the inflammation of the
bronchial tubes, which become affected in an immune response whose cause is
still unclear. A potential vaccine is undergoing trials at a London
hospital. Now, a new treatment for sufferers is proposed by a team at the
University of Iowa. Dr Joel Kline, a lung expert at the university, told New
Scientist magazine that the body was programmed from birth to recognise the
DNA of invasive bacteria and some viruses. He explained: "Your body can't
wait weeks for a specific antibody to be produced to begin attacking." Early
exposure to bacteria, and stimulation of an antibody response is thought to
stop people developing asthma later in life. Dr Kline's work aims to prompt
the response by using bacterial DNA. An experiment with mice, sensitised to
develop asthmatic symptoms when they encountered a protein from eggs, showed
that sniffing short sections of DNA from bacteria, mixed with the protein,
did not lead to symptoms. Dr Kline also found that the number of white blood
cells entering the lungs and causing inflammation fell to 10 per cent of
previous levels.

*Police have opened China's first DNA data bank in Shanghai, storing blood<br>

The Justice Ministry plans a nationwide network of such centers meant to

of the ministry's Judicial Authentication Research Institute, was quoted as
saying. Similar centers already exist in the United States and Britain.
