White Mars is, as its title implies, Brian Aldiss's considered reply to the 
novels--Red Mars, Green Mars and Blue Mars--in which Kim Stanley Robinson 
portrayed the terraforming of our neighbour planet and the creation of a 
utopian society there. Aldiss disapproves of the whole idea of meddling with 
another world in the first place, and also, more genially, of the melodrama 
surrounding the creation of Robinson's utopia. Where Robinson's Martians get 
their chance after near-genocidal warfare on Mars, and environmental 
disaster on Earth, Aldiss's get theirs as the result of a corruption and 
scandal-fuelled recession in which supplies for the Martian colony are a 
victim of cuts. This is, unusually for the shrewd and sometimes cynical 
Aldiss, a novel with a hero--Tom Jeffreys, the Thomas Jefferson of this 
Martian revolution:

<p>
"His manner was less severe than well controlled. He showed great 
determination for the cause in which he believed, yet softened it with 
humour, which sprang from an innate modesty. He was not above self-mockery. 
In his speech he adopted the manner of a plain man, yet what he said was 
often unexpected."

<p>
This is a very English, and a very urbane book, in which there is an awful 
lot of talk--about utopia, about consciousness, about sub-atomic particles; 
Aldiss collaborated on parts of the book with mathematician and physicist 
Roger Penrose--this is a wise book and also a knowledgeable one. --Roz 
Kaveney
