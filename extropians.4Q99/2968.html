I think Robert Freitas has taken a first step in this direction.
Chapter 14 (Extraterrestrial Intelligence) of his Xenology (unpublished
book) has a discussion about a "Sentience Quotient" based on Bremermann's
information density limits.

<p>
  "...Sentience Quotient... [is] The maximum bit rate a sentient
   creature can process per unit time interval (in bits/second),</a>
   divided by the quantity of mass-energy the entity needs to do it
   (in kilograms). 

<p>
Given Bremermann's limits, the maximum sentience quotient is
(log_10(1.4 x 10^50) or 50.  He estimates that humans have a
sentience quotient of around 10 (10^10 bits/sec-kg).  Since
a rock has a very low bit processing rate (probably directly
related to temperature gradients in it), it probably has a 
very low SQ.  A plant on the other hand since it is moving fluids
around and turning genes on and off might get a SQ of 4-6.
(You might expect a higher number given the number of cells
but you have to adjust for the redundancy where there is no
"extra" information being processed.)   A Matrioshka Brain gets
a SQ someplace in the range of 15-20.

<p>
To get a SQ higher than 20, I think you have to do away with
much of the matter and compute using quantum interactions with
things like free neutrons, single electrons, neutrinos or
free photons.  Within our foreseeable future it looks like only
single electrons or photons are very likely.  Even then things
look pretty difficult because most current approaches require
a large amount of external matter to manipulate these "objects".
You might be able to get a high SQ in a photon "gas", but you
are cheating if you neglect the mass of material required to
produce that state.

<p>
So to the degree that "qualia" == "feelings" == "SQ" we do
have a way of quantifying it.
