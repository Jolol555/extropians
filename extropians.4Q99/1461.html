It might go a little something like this,

<p>
    Tom Jeffreys surveyed the sight of the accident.
    Metallic debris lay strewn across the library floor
    like so many failed analogies.

<p>
    "The book, where is it?"

<p>
    The librarian lead Tom to Ground Zero, lying in a crater
    a single robot, it's head exploded, clutching a copy of
    the Complete Works of Kurt Godel.

<p>
    "Hadn't you been told not to let the robots in here?"

<p>
    The young librarian did not reply.

<p>
    "The Emperors New Mind is required reading in school,
    how could you have possibly not known?"

<p>
    "I'm sorry mister," the librarian replied, "I ain't
    never been to school".

<p>
    Quite how this ignorant fool became a librarian was
    beyond Tom Jeffreys.  Despite his initial urge to beat
    the boy within an inch of his life, he resisted, but
    that was Tom's way, his manner was less severe than well
    controlled, whatever that meant.

<p>
    "Let me tell you a story young librarian," Tom pulled up
    a chair, "Over the past few decades, electronic computer
    technology has made enormous strides.  Moreover, there
    can be little doubt that in the decades to follow, there
    will be further great advances in speed, capacity and
    logical design.  The computers of today may be made to
    seem as sluggish and primitive as the mechanical
    calculators of yesteryear now appear to us. There is
    something almost frightening about the pace of
    development.  Already computers are able to perform
    numerous tasks that had previously been the exclusive
    province of human thinking, with a speed and accuracy
    which far outstrip anything that a human being can
    achieve [and so on for 600 pages]"

<p>
Or perhaps not...
