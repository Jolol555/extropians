<p>
<a href="0699.html#0701qlink4">&gt;As I have said for years, the immersion of extropian values into</a><br>

<p>
Nobody panic, if you had read the instructions carefully ;) you
would realize this is a conceptual exercise. (think tank)

<p>
But there is a point. Are any of the cast of characters currently
running for the top slot in the corporation even remotely
interesting to you?

<p>
Didn't think so.... 


<p>
Thanks for the input....

Current Reading: Lipstick Traces by Greil Marcus

<p>
"At First the book seemed entirely a conceit-precious. In fact it
told a very specific story, and carried an affirmation that it was
the only story worth telling: the book was bound in heavy
sandpaper, so that when placed on a shelf it would destroy other
books."  (page 163)
