 just removed 'evolution' from mandatory topics in their
 educational system.  Their reason:  the topic of evolution creates
 too much controversy and detracts from the purpose of the 
 educational system.

    It's always interesting to see how two sides see the same event.  I 
caught a 700 Club broadcast yesterday on the Kentucky State Board of 
Education's actions.  According to them, the only thing was changed was the 
term "Evolution" to "Change over Time", and they reported this as an attempt 
by Kentucky to hide their evolutionary teachings through a name change.  So, 
both sides see this as an action against their position.  Interesting.
