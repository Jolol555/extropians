<a name="3280qlink1">It's amazing to think that as of 1996, 10 to 12 percent 
of schoolboys in the U.S were on an addictive drug, Ritalin, 
about which the manufacture states: "Sufficient data on safety 
and efficacy of long-term use of Ritalin in children are not yet 
available. ... Long-term effects of Ritalin in children have not 
been well established." (1998) While the statements are an effort 
to avoid liability for any harm caused by their product, they're 
also largely true: after being on the market for decades, there 
are few if any long-term studies on Ritalin use. But there are
some clues. The manufacture's insert also notes that growth 
suppression has been reported.  Some research suggests 
the possibility of brain atrophy after chronic use.</a>

<p>
Those concerns may prove unfounded, but what if they prove
true and millions of lives are forever diminished during a 
reckless diagnostic fad that redefines normal young-male 
behavior as a psychiatric disorder requiring drug addiction?

<p>
It's good to see a popular columnist like George Will take on 
this reckless and even totalitarian venture into mass drugging:

Here's a select excerpt:

<p>
Boys Will Be Boys, or you can just drug them. 

<p>
By George F. Will (12/02/99)

<p>
One theory holds that ADHD is epidemic because of the modern
acceleration of life--the environmental blitzkrieg of MTV, 
video games, e-mail, cell phones, etc. But the magazine Lingua 
Franca reports that Ken Jacobson, a doctoral candidate in 
anthropology at the University of Massachusetts, conducted a 
cross-cultural study of ADHD that included observation of two 
groups of English school children, one diagnosed with ADHD, 
the other not. He observed them with reference to 35 behaviors 
(e.g., "giggling," "squirming," "blurting out") and found no
significant differences between the groups.  

<p>
Children, he says, tend to talk, fidget and fool around--
"all the classical ADHD-type behaviors. If you're predisposed 
to label any child as ADHD, the distracted troublemaker or the 
model student, you'll find a way to observe these behaviors." 
So what might explain such a predisposition? Paul R. McHugh, 
professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, writing in Commentary, 
argues that ADHD, "social phobia" (usual symptom: fear of 
public speaking) and other disorders certified by the American 
Psychiatric Association's "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders" are proliferating rapidly. This is 
because of a growing tendency to regard as mental problems 
many characteristics that are really aspects of individuality. 

<p>
So pharmacology is employed to relieve burdensome aspects of
temperament. "Psychiatric conditions," says McHugh, "are 
routinely differentiated by appearances alone," even when it 
is "difficult to distinguish symptoms of illness from normal 
variations in human life," or from the normal responses of 
sensitive people to life's challenges. But if a condition 
can be described, it can be named; once named, a distinct 
disorder can be linked to a particular treatment. McHugh 
says some experts who certify new disorders "receive 
extravagant annual retainers from pharmaceutical companies 
that profit from the promotion of disorders treatable by 
the companies' medications." 

<p>
The idea that most individuals deficient inattentiveness 
or confidence are sick encourages what McHugh calls 
pharmacological "mental cosmetics." This "should be 
offensive to anyone who values the richness of human 
psychological diversity. Both medically and morally,
encumbering this naturally occurring diversity with the 
terminology of disease is a first step toward efforts, 
however camouflaged, to control it."
