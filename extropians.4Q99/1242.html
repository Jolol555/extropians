Good comeback.:)  You can do better than that.:)  Silly human.

And if not, then you argument falls apart.:)  Surely, if you stack the deck,</a>
you'll win at every turn.  Is that what you want?  To win or to learn?

<p>
But seriously, I do see what you mean, but an important point here is much
wider.  Doctrinaire art of all sorts is stiff, mechanical, formulaic.  I
gave other instances of this.  Those who adhered to Amy Lowell's Imagist
rantings wound up making such and they were hardly Nazis or Objectivists.  I
think this slavishness is bad for art, though sometimes something like this
can inspire someone.  Certainly, H.D. was able to take Imagism and make it
her own -- rather than just becoming a Imagist-poem-machine.

Cheers!
