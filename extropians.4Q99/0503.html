I think that the producers would want to start with a balance of genders, 
otherwise it could turn violent very quickly.  Franz de Waal has written
accounts of escalating violence that took place within chimpanzee 
populations in which the number of females got reduced for some reason.  The
remaining females faced rape and many died from exhaustion.  Many of the
males died in the fighting.  Now, I'm not saying that humans can't act
better than that, and maybe the presence of cameras would act as a
dampening mechanism.  But the
<br>
tensions would be there, nonetheless. 

<p>
And, please, don't bring up Lord of the Flies!  That novel was written as a
specific scenario, deliberately constructed so as to remove every civilizing
influence--maturity, parental figures, another gender, a system of rules,
etc.
