Jeff, I did an experiment about 12 years ago at China Lake.  We had
<a name="3660qlink1">a centrifuge, 2 meter radius.  I and some guys were arguing about
what would happen if you put an egg in a bucket of water in the
centrifuge, would it sling to the bottom or continue to float?  I argued
that if the eggs were floating in 1 G, they would float in 100 G.

<p>
<a name="3739qlink1">I bought a dozen guppies, put em in a plastic thermos bottle,
put the bottle in the centrifuge and spun em up to 100 g for 10
minutes.</a>  When I stopped, all the fish were still alive, but were
swimming in a spiral pattern, like a well-thrown football. {8-]
Please dont turn me in to the animal rights people.  {8^D  spike
