<p>
"God" who is eternally complete, who directs the stars, who is
the master of fates, who elevates man from his lowliness to
himself, who speaks from the cosmos to every single human soul,
is the most brilliant manifestation of the goal of perfection to date.*
In "God's nature", religious mankind perceives the way to height.
In his call it hears again the innate voice of life which must have
its direction towards the goal of perfection, towards overcoming
the feeling of lowliness and transitoriness of the existence here
below. The "human soul", as a part of the movement of life, is
endowed with the ability to participate in the uplift, elevation,
perfection, and completion.

*But of course Adler could not have known about "Transhumanism"
or "Extropianism".
