No problem.  I just have a hot-button when people mention homosexuality as 
an evolutionary dead end.  In my mind it indicates the classic flaw in 
believing that every single individual has to propagate or else it is not 
furthering the evolution of the group.  This is clearly false to anyone who 
has studied biology.  Anything that helps the group survive improves the 
breed.

<p>
An example:  Drones help a beehive survive.  Just because they don't produce 
does not mean that they are an evolutionary dead end.  Their evolution was 
crucial in the survival of hive-based groups.  By having non-reproducing 
workers do all the engineering and work, this frees up the breeders to do 
nothing but breed.  Neither could survive without the other.  People who 
think that the breeders are highly evolved while the drones are unevolved, 
deviant evolutionary mistakes, is not recognizing the full range of 
evolutionary processes.  Evolution developed the entire hive structure to 
allow the propagation of each succeeding generation.
(end of reproduction)

<p>
Even though homosexual individuals over the course of history have 
contributed a great deal I cannot see this as an evolutionary adaptation.  
When it comes to supporting the "breeders" of society with their young 
offspring I think of a teenage girl coming over to babysit and not the 
friendly gay neighbor! lol  And we do not have heterosexual couples doing 
nothing but breeding while they are provided for by hordes of gay human 
"drones!"  Of course we don't have insect-like reproductive rates either!

<a name="2934qlink1">Perhaps this is stereotyping but gays are often seen as very organized, 
creative and artistic.  A high proportion of gays tend to be in theater, 
film, acting, clothes design and the arts in general.  Perhaps the "side 
effect" of this condition is a propensity for talent in these areas and by 
that society benefits.  And yet there are hererosexuals who are also very 
gifted in these areas.</a>

<p>
It would be interesting to know just how accurate the "ten per cent of the 
population is homosexual" rule is true.  In a class discussion I had some 
felt it could be as low as two per cent for males and as high as one-third 
for females but this was just conjecture.

<p>
I tend to think homosexuality is rooted in the genes but environment could 
play a major factor also.  Imagine a world where parents can have the DNA of 
their unborn baby scanned and if "gay genes" are detected they can be 
replaced.  It would be fascinating to see sociologically whether homosexual 
numbers would shrink or remain stable.  Would government try to stop this 
from happening?  I don't think so in the United States.


<p>
sincerely,

John Grigg
