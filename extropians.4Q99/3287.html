According to Moore's LAW it should take 15 years to get a computer 500 times
faster than the two fastest supercomputers in the world, an IBM machine at
Lawrence Livermore and a INTEL one at Los Alamos;<a name="3298qlink1"> however today IBM
announced they will spend $100,000,000 make a machine of that power in
just 5 years. This will be called "Blue Gene" and will<a name="3341qlink1"> be specially designed to
do one thing, not play chess but solve the awesomely complex protein folding
</a>
</a>
problem.<a name="3298qlink2"> IBM thinks there is lots of money to be made in analyzing the huge
amount of data that will come from  the Human Genome Project,</a> I think it
<a name="3298qlink3">could also be used to design nano machines.</a>

<p>
<a name="3298qlink4"><a name="3290qlink1">To achieve these blistering speeds a radically new computer architecture
must be used that has 1,048,576 processors. IBM will develop a new chip
that contains 32 processors as well as lots of on chip memory but has
only 57 machine level instructions compared with about 200 for most RISC
<a name="3298qlink5">machines.</a> A great deal of effort will also go into making an operating
</a>
system that is more fault tolerant than anything now in existence, if one of the
processors or even an entire chip malfunctions the supercomputer will not die,
it will just slow down very slightly.</a> They also intend to improve algorithms so
that even a machine this fast doesn't take an unreasonable amount of time
to provide a 3D image of a protein from an amino acid sequence.
