I liked the article as well.  The odds of success seem high enough that some
people should be working on it.  But the lack of theoretical guidance and the
difficulty of any one firm being able to appropriate the value of their
contribution to the whole research line mean any one company should be shy
about getting too involved.  So maybe the market is doing exactly the right
thing, putting a few dozen but not more researchers on the topic.

<p>
It is the vast government funding of traditional fusion approaches that seems
misguided.
