&gt; Great, so tell us how.
&gt; Until then, I favor Chalmers over Dennett. There is a quote I like which
&gt; really sums up the situation on consciousness:
&gt;
&gt; "At the present time the status of physicalism [your view] is similar to
&gt; that which the
&gt;      hypothesis that matter is energy would have had if uttered by a
&gt; pre-Socratic
&gt;      philosopher. We do not have the beginnings of a conception of how it
&gt; might be
&gt;      true. In order to understand the hypothesis that a mental event is a
&gt; physical
&gt;      event, we require more than an understanding of the word 'is'." -
&gt; Thomas Nagel
&gt;

</pre>
<p>
I take it that the quote above is from Nagel's famous piece "What is it like to
be a bat?"

<p>
I like the response to Nagel by Douglas Hofstader in "What is it like to bat a
bee?" in _The Mind's I_ (p. 406):


<UL>
  <li>  The image conjured up by the phrase "What is it like to be X"? is
  <li>  so seductive and tempting ... Our minds are so flexible, so willing to
  <li>  accept this notion, this idea that there is "something it is line to be a
bat."
  <li>  Furthermore, we also willingly buy the idea that there are certain things
  <li>  that it is "like something to be" -- "be-able things," or "BATs" for short
  <li>  -- such as bats, cows, people; and other things for which this doesn't hold
  <li>  -- such as balls, steaks, galaxies (even though a galaxy may contain innu-
  <li>  merable be-able things).  What is the criterion for "BAT-itude"?
<br>
<i>--</i><br>
  <li>  In philosophical literature, many phrases have been used to try to
  <li>  evoke the right flavors for what being sentient really is ("being sentient"
  <li>  is one of them).  Two old terms are "soul" and  "amima."  These days, an
  <li>  "in" word is "intentionality."  There is the old standby, "consciousness."
  <li>  Then there is "being a subject," "having an inner life," "having exprei-
  <li>  ence," "having point of view," having "perceptual aboutness" or " "per-
  <li>  sonhood" or a "self" or "free will."  In some people's eyes, "having a
  <li>  mind," "being intelligent," and just plain old "thinking" have the right
  <li>  flavors.  In Searle's article ("Minds, Brains, and Programs"), the contrast
was
  <li>  drawn between "form" (hollow and mechanical) and "content" (alive and
  <li>  intentional); the words "syntactic" and "semantic" (or "meaningless" and
  <li>  "meaningful") were also used to characterize this distinction.  All of the
terms in
  <li>  this huge showcase are nearly synonymous.  They all have to do with the
  <li>  object in question: "Is this object a BAT, or not?"  But is there really some

&gt;
&gt; Qualia are REAL. This is undeniable. They are not a hypothesis used to
&gt; explain a phenomena - they are a phenomena which make themselves immediately
&gt; accessible to whoever experiences them. They are the fact which other
&gt; hypothesi must explain. I suspect (strongly) that they are intimately tied
&gt; to, or are caused by, or perhaps just "are" physical phenomena, in the sense
&gt; that holograms are light. People who deny their existence remind me of the
&gt; Mr. Spock stereotyped scientist portrayed on tv who will put forth some
&gt; argument like "love doesn't really exist, it's simply a series of
&gt; biochemical reactions", I wonder at what kind of weird motivation he has in
&gt; denying the plainly obvious, or trying to language around a clearly evident
&gt; fact.

<p>
My turn to quote from Chalmers on page 215 of _The Conscious Mind_:


<UL>
  <li>  All this metaphysical grandeur is well and good, one might reply, but how
<a name="3672qlink1">  <li>  does it cash out in practice?  In particular, how can we discover</a> the psycho-

  <li>  physical laws that will constitute a theory of consciousness?  After all,
there
  <li>  is an enormous problem for a theory of consciousness that does not confront
<a name="3672qlink2">  <li>  a theory of physics: the lack of data.  Because consciousness</a> is not directly

  <li>  observable in experimental contexts, we cannot simply run experiments mea-
  <li>  suring the experiences that are associated with various physical processes,
  <li>  thereby confirming and disconfirming various psychophysical hypotheses.
<a name="3672qlink3">  <li>  Indeed, it might seem that the untestability of any theory</a> of consciousness
  <li>  that we might put forward would relegate such theories to the status of
  <li>  pseudoscience.


</UL>
<p>
I did not argue *for* physicalism (another failure of reason is that an argument
against something must, necessarily be an argument for something else), I am
pointing out that any theory that has no data, and is untestable, shares the
same status as superstition.  Some superstitions turn out<a name="3672qlink4"> to be true.  However,
</a>
given all the non-testable things out there to believe in, and that I cannot
find a way<a name="3672qlink5"> to break the symmetry, I choose to wait for data to believe in any.</a>
