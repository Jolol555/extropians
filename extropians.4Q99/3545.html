<a href="3509.html#3545qlink1">&gt; That's another thing I like about the SF Bay Area.  Stanford has a good</a><br>

It's heartwarming to know there are still such places.  The University
of
<br>
Delaware was like that 25-30 years ago -- I could use the Morris Library
for research even while I was in high school, and later, whether or not
I happened to be a current student, I could go and hang out in the
current
<br>
periodical room, or browse the stacks, and read to my heart's content.

<p>
Later, after moving to New York and enrolling at New York University,
I found out that you can only get into Bobst Library (through a
turnstile,
<br>
past a uniformed guard) if your student ID has a **current semester's**
validation sticker on it.  That means, if you're a full-time student,
but
<br>
don't happen to be taking summer classes (let's say), you can't use
the library during the summer.  I was appalled at the bloody-mindedness
of it (but later came to accept it as the very spirit of NYU).

<p>
I would have thought that by now, many more institutions would have
become more like NYU and less like the U of D, but I'm glad to see
that it hasn't happened everywhere!

P.S. -- I found ways around some of NYU's library restrictions
(involving
<br>
the use of a color photocopier), but I won't go into that in detail.
