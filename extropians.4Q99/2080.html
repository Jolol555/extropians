Hi, extropians!

<p>
I just thought that you as educators and scientists of the 21st century 
could be interested in my recently-opened and long-awaited 
explosively-controversial website:

<p>
<a href="http://www.conrado.net/free_science.html">http://www.conrado.net/free_science.html</a>

<p>
into which I have put so much love, and so much effort to insure the 
accuracy of the facts. Also,

<p>
<a href="http://www.conrado.net/arthur_c_clarke.html">http://www.conrado.net/arthur_c_clarke.html</a>

<p>
.. ..deals extensively with the very promising new energy technologies which <br>
are at last emerging in fuel cells and other electrochemical techniques, and 
which could indeed instantly regenerate our choked dying biosphere and put 
an end to the fossil fuel age.

<p>
<i>.. ..</i><br>

<p>
However, I think.. .. that.. .. . I think that it is about time we stopped 
being mesmerized by the robotic and hedonistic messages from ``The Matrix``, 
woke up, and realized that this is just NOT the technologically-enhanced but 
humanly-directed world that, for example, Clarke and Kubrick envisioned for 
2001. I think that we still have time, however, to make it by 2010 to where 
the film ``2010: Odyssey Two`` brightly and upliftingly assured us we could 
be; but for this to happen, we need to, in my view, stop looking at the 
beatifically-promised, lulling, ``peace-bringing`` New World Order as the 
solution, and realize that, despite what Clarke and the charming post-modern 
ecumenistic Russian fellow whose website handles Clarke books may think, the 
New World Order will NOT witness the ignition of Jupiter and the liberation 
of mankind from its blue oceanic cradle.

<p>
Indeed, both Navigators of our Future have, in my view, fallen for the Great 
Luciferian deception, and in their probable pride of being initiated into a 
Secret which is no more, they may have failed to realize that The New World 
Order is actually PART of Lucifer-Rising, and Lucifer wants to bring, not 
the peace and enlightenment it promises.. .. .., but the robotic and 
mechanized merging of any vestige of human individuality into an infernal 
collective Borg-Global-Brain.. .., and then The Black Sun for All Earth on 
December 21st 2012, The Zero Barrier. If you think that what happened to 
some of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago was catastrophic wait for what 
will happen if we now allow the New World Order to go through.

<p>
But, don't worry, Jupiter CAN be ignited, and the Star Child knows how.. .. 
The Reptilian shadow is not going to win. Get us out of the atmosphere now. 
12 years to critical mass.

<p>
My contact addresses are all on my website if anyone is further interested. 
I recently graduated in Physics from Cal Tech.

<p>
loVe,

<p>
Conrado.
