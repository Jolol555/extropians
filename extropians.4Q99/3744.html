*Maskless process creates submicron pillars. "'We discovered the effect<br>
totally accidentally, when we were trying to stamp out nanostructures with
my imprinting technique." Imprinting, which Chou also invented, stamps out
tiny nanomachine parts from partially cooled liquid polymers with a
template. Tiny machine parts, with features as small as six nanometers —
only a few dozen atoms wide — have been successfully stamped out with Chou's
nanoimprinting technique. The only other way to create such small machine
parts is with X-ray lithography, a much more complex process. (EETimes

*In the Dec 99 Physics Today there is an article: Nanoscale Fluctuations at<br>
Solid Surfaces. Before you build things in the nanoworld, you’d better make
sure you know how atomic fluctuations affect your structure’s size and
shape. --Zoltán Toroczkai and Ellen D. Williams (only a mention of the

*Scientists look for molecular 'meaning of life'  Scientists are close to<br>
finding the essence of life - at least on a genetic level - and it comes
down to about 300 genes. US researchers think this is the minimum set of
molecular instructions required to build a living organism. (BBC Dec 10,99)

*Secrets Of DNA Transcription Laid Bare In 3-D. Scientists at the University<br>
of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)
have obtained the first good picture of a major chunk of the machinery that
turns genes on and off.With the help of electron microscopy and a relatively
new technique called single particle image analysis, the researchers
reconstructed a three-dimensional picture of the heart of the machine -- the
part that binds to DNA.

*Nucleus Is Larger than Life. A typical atomic nucleus is just 10-14 m<br>
across, but sometimes its influence can extend far beyond its size. Using a
beam of ultracold neutrons to probe the gadolinium nucleus, a team has
measured the largest nuclear "cross section" ever observed: The nucleus
swallowed up any neutrons approaching within a distance 10,000 times its
diameter. (Physical Review Focus 12/9/99)

*Deep thoughts draw crowd. Advancing technology may permit us increasingly<br>
to gratify ourselves and free ourselves from pain, but the question must be
posed, says Laura Shannon, a bioethics philosopher: Do we have a right to
all that luxury? "Uh, I do!" (Edmund Journal Extra Dec 12, 99) Small

*Molecular fats prevent nerve sheath abnormality. A study led by scientists<br>
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill points to a group of
lipids (fats) that are crucial to proper formation of the myelin sheath
surrounding nerve fibers. Although without direct clinical implications for
human disease, the new findings help solve a scientific puzzle while adding
important new knowledge to the molecular biology of myelin and diseases of
myelin loss, particularly multiple sclerosis. (Eurekalert 12/13)

*Y is it so? And will sex for fun survive? Fast-forward to 2099, and we may<br>
be talking genetically enhanced IVF babies, sex between artificial minds,
"love" pills and sexual surrogates to help marriages survive. "Yeah, lets
fast forward!" Professor Savulescu says that gene deletions – which appear
to correlate with increasing male infertility – indicate the Y chromosome
"has a limited evolutionary lifetime that means the male is facing eventual
extinction. "Oops!" (Australian 12/13/99)

*Getting heavy. Perhaps the newborn Universe wasn't just for lightweights.<br>
Did the fireball early Universe cook up a much richer cocktail than anyone
realised? A German astrophysicist is challenging the idea that the early
Universe created only hydrogen, helium and lithium. He thinks it may also
have made heavier elements such as carbon. (New Scientist 12/11/99)

*Like a good marriage, the relationship between biology and computing is a<br>
two-way street. While computing has become essential to biology, biology
helps computing in return. When it comes to decoding DNA, science pooling
its talents. A new skill combining biology and computing has exploded into
what is probably the hottest career opportunity for college graduates in the
coming decade. (Pioneer Planer 11/12/12/99)

*Terms of employment for research physicists are changing rapidly. Over the<br>
last ten or fifteen years, basic research groups at, for example, AT&amp;T, IBM,
and the petroleum companies have mostly been dismantled to be replaced by
more applied and directed efforts. Even product-related research groups have
often shrunk. Scientists at all levels have been replaced, retired,
terminated, moved, or fired—sometimes gracefully, sometimes not. (Physics

*Cornell researchers unlock a mystery of plant reproduction by discovering<br>
what causes pollen to be accepted or rejected. Over a century ago,
scientists discovered that some plants don't permit fertilization by their
own pollen. And for the past quarter-century, scientists have known that
cellular communication exists between the female stigma and the male gamete,
or pollen, it receives. But no one knew how the stigma could tell the
difference between the plant's own pollen and that from other plants. (Nov)

MATERIAL. Take an ice cube, plop it into a glass of water and the cube will
slowly undergo the very ordinary melting transition from the solid to liquid
phase. Using ultrafast pulses of light and x-rays, an interdisciplinary
group at the University of California, San Diego has directly observed the
melting of material without taking the route of a typical melting process.

GENE RESEARCHERS APOLOGIZE FOR LAPSES IN TEEN'S FATAL TREATMENT
from The Washington Post

<p>
*As the ongoing investigation into the death of a teenager taking part in a<br>
University of Pennsylvania gene therapy experiment continues to turn up new
deficiencies in the teen's treatment, researchers yesterday apologized for
their lapses. Federal investigators revealed new evidence that Jesse
Gelsinger was too sick to have undergone the experimental treatment in
September. They also announced that the Penn researchers had changed the
rules for inclusion in the study without the approval of the Food and Drug
Administration. (Washington Post 12/12/99)
