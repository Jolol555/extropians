I did something similar at the Univ. of Washington.  I sat through
a bunch of 400 and graduate level classes in molecular biology
the year I was taking apart the problem of aging in a detailed way.
It would have been too much to take the classes for credit and devote
my time to all the library research I did, but the synergistic effect
was great.

<a name="3572qlink1">The Univ. of Washington is also pretty open minded about using the
libraries.  I can walk into any of them and stay until closing.
They won't let you check out books unless they get a letter from my
company stating what I want to use the libraries</a> for.  It seems
like a formality to screen out the loose nuts rather than any attempt
to restrict library use.  Washington state is pretty big on promoting
synergy between academic and business activities (as is Stanford).
In contrast students going to Harvard don't even own the software
they write for classes (unless they've changed the rules since the
mid '70s).  The attitude is that anything created using University
property becomes the property of the university.

I think its an East-coast vs. West-coast thing.
