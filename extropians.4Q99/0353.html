Perhaps, perhaps not.  I do however tend to think globally and have enough
experience with that that I tend to think the activisim of local kooks
largely *irrelevant*.  I subject things to the acid test of "could they
really stop a number of determined individuals".  The answer I believe
is no.

<p>
Exactly -- they cite "human germline engineering" and "human cloning".
Both of these are "edge" technologies that have little relevance
to our primary agenda.  They are outlawed in specific countries.
But that is largely irrelevant.  They are small scale technologies
that could easily be researched on a yacht in international waters.


<p>
Their perspective of avoiding a "commodification" I generally agree
with if that is taken to mean avoiding patents on my genetic sequences.
I've already addressed how these technologies are good if they want
to make us truely equal and Hal has provided a nice perspective on
taking apart the discrimination question.

<p>
By and large however it comes down to an economic scale question.
The Ag-bio industry comes is a few billion dollars (max)!  The
NIH and Pharma industries are an order of magnitude larger.
Organizations like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club have "affected"
how we do logging and real estate development, but they haven't
stopped it.  Even if you stopped all Ag-bio tomorrow, would that
impact us negatively?  No, it might even help us because those
well-trained scientists would go off and get jobs in other-biotech
that would be more directly related to things that might improve
human health and longevity.

<p>
Yes, there is a fight coming -- fundamentally it will be about the
an agenda of preventing the implementation of technologies that
allow life-extension.  But we are already pretty well down that
slippery slope so I tend to see it as the opponents have already lost.
I also tend to view it as a personal self-interest problem because
it is very difficult to get people enthusiastic about plants that
they don't for the most part need.  On the other hand it is very
easy to get them excited about their own personal well being.

<p>
If you want to cite a marketing mis-call look at the automobile
industry with things like air-bags and door beams.  They got
caught unawares when the market shifted and they realized that
people would actually pay more for cars that had better passive
safety features.  They had to scramble to get those features into
the cars so they could remain competitive.

<p>
You probably have a better read on the "mainstream" person since you
have to deal on a daily basis with misunderstandings between them.
I may have a greater experience with the "clever" person(s) and
see how they will generally go over/under/around or through the
irrational roadblocks presented by the "mainstream" person.  As Dr.
Hekimi (the discover of the nematode clock genes) once told
me, "What man can conceive, he will eventually do".  The efforts
of the luddites will not stop progress, they simply make the path
a little more adventuresome.
