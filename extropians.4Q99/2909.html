This is why I've narrowed my choice down to the octopus.  It's brain is
sophisticated, yet very different from the human one.  In fact, the
divergence in evolution dates back to the Cambrian period, some 550 million
years ago.  I think it would be easier, at first, just to tweak things like
brain size.  Of course, if I had a better understanding of which regions of
the octopus brain were responsible for what behaviors, etc. (and what
strands of DNA for those in the octopus), it would make this a bit easier.
E.g., one might merely induce mutations and look for changes in those areas
and pray.:)

<p>
<a href="2882.html#2909qlink7">&gt; Looked at this way, uplifting could be considered a sort of reproduction</a><br>

<a name="3003qlink1"><a name="2928qlink1">Maybe.  I wouldn't see much point in making a human mind in an</a> octopus body,</a>
though, I assume, such a mind would still be different -- in much the same
way people who drow up with some major difference (being very tall or short,
blind or deaf, e.g.) would add a distinctive new shade of _human_ being.
However, given the paranthetic remarks, there might be moral concerns about
this.  After all, some might think a human mind in a nonhuman body might be
akin to crippling fetuses for the sake of making crippled children.
