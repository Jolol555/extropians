<a href="0221.html#0236qlink1">&gt; Yes.  I see the concern, however, over the societal bias that individuals</a><br>
<i>&gt; who have a graduate degree are viewed as more capable, smarter, etc.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; the upper classes of American society, an advanced degree is viewed as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; societal credential, and people do not ask 'did you get a graduate degree'</i><br>
<i>&gt; but 'what is your graduate degree in'?</i><br>

It depends on where you are.  At my company, we pay college dropouts with a
few years of programming experience more than twice what we would pay a PhD
in any other field.  This is, I think, fairly typical for the whole
industry, and it applies to jobs other than programming.  You have to get a
break somehow, and a degree might provide that, but there are other ways,
and at a good company performance will count.

<a name="0246qlink1"><a name="0242qlink1">To many in Silicon Valley, "PhD" can have negative connotations.  They think
"missed the boat on the whole internet thing" or "can't deal with the real
world".  It's certainly not a universal attitude, and there are many people
with ties to academic culture who value formal education.  But there is a
Wild West, "You may have book learning, but can you shoot?" attitude that
I've seen before, even among the elite.
