Tipler is not dealing with the expanding-universe case so any problems
relating to horizons in that scenario would not apply for him.  He
is working with the Big Crunch model and although there are some issues
with horizons he assumes/calculates them away.

<a name="1050qlink1">Frank Tipler and David Deutsch both take an aggressive and (to me)
puzzling approach to these issues.  They claim on philosophical grounds
that the universe MUST be such that life can exist (and grow) forever.
Therefore if we are right about eternal life being impossible in an open
universe, we must be wrong about the universe being open.  So one of the
predictions of Tipler's theory is that current astronomical opinion is
wrong, and the universe will turn out to be closed.
