Here is the only one I can find:

<a href="http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/award.htm">http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/award.htm</a>

<p>
And as two papers[1] in the March 1997 journal Virology reveal,
the electronmicrographs disclose "major contaminants" in "pure HIV".

<p>
HIV expert Hans Gelderblom of Berlin's Robert Koch Institute, whose
photos of non-banded 'HIV' material have been the industrial benchmark
since 1987, co-authored the first paper which describes the
contamination as "an excess of vesicles" - particles of cellular
proteins,
<br>
that may contain DNA or RNA. In a consecutive paper, a US research
team from the AIDS Vaccine Programme in Maryland reveal carefully,
"It is unknown how these cellular proteins associate with the virus" and

<p>
warn, "The presence of microvesicles in purified retroviruses has
practical implications": both teams discuss the resulting nonspecifity
of
<br>
HIV tests, all of which are based on early unchecked "purified HIV".

<p>
In an historic admission that it has never been established which
proteins
<br>
constitute 'HIV', the US scientists conclude, "The development of
various purification strategies to separate microvesicles from
HIV-particles ... will greatly enhance our ability to identify
virion-associated cellular proteins." The imaging step in attempts at
retroviral isolation was deemed essential when isolation procedure was
discussed and decided at the Pasteur Institute, Paris in 1972, but it
has
<br>
never been published before in the 13-year history of 'HIV'.

In 1988 Dr. Kary Mullis, the 1993 Nobel prize winner for Chemistry was
employed
<br>
by the US National Institutes for Health (NIH) to set up analyses for
HIV testing.
<br>
When preparing his report he asked a virologist colleague for a
reference that HIV is
<br>
"the probable cause of AIDS". He was told he did not need one. Mullis
was
<br>
surprised.

<p>
"I disagreed. It was totally remarkable to me that the individual who
had
<br>
discovered the cause of a deadly and as-yet-uncured disease would not
be continually referenced in the scientific papers until that disease
was
<br>
cured and forgotten… There had to be a published paper, or perhaps
several of them, which taken together indicated that HIV was the
probable cause of AIDS". Otherwise, as Mullis was forced to conclude,
"The entire campaign against a disease increasingly regarded as the
twentieth-century Black Death was based on a hypothesis whose origins
no one could recall. That defied both scientific and common sense".

<p>
A decade later Mullis was to write, "I finally understood why I was
having so much
<br>
trouble finding the references that linked HIV to AIDS. There weren’t
any".
