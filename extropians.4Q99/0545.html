Christian mystics have always, in one way or another, affirmed
as an epistemological caveat a "doctrine of ignorance". C.f.
Jacob Boehme, Angelus Silesius, and Meister Eckhart.  Of course
the Scholastic philosopher believed that God can be known to
some extent by means of axiomatic deduction -- St. Thomas
Acquinas.

<a name="0567qlink1">If we assume the being of a "hypertranscendental" or "supernatural"
 object whose properties are omniscence, omnipresence,
and omnipotence, then I suppose the human dualities of  "goodevil",
 "loving-sadistic" and so on cannot, by definition, have
the slightest relevance to the essence of this object. In this
sense, Bryan, it is also inappropriate to say "God is Good".

Spinoza said simply that God is sui generis, and Moses used
the term "jahweh" rather than "eloi" when reporting God's
self-definition to humans: "I am what I am" is what "jahweh"
means in Hebrew.  Parenthetically, Jesus on the cross used
another tradition when he said "Eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani?"
or "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" in Aramaic.
