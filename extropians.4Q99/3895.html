PIONEER 10 HONORED BY STAMP! 

<p>
On November 18, the US Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the
Pioneer 10 spacecraft. It was selected as one of the 15 icons for the 
decade of the 1970s as part of its Celebrate the Century postage stamp 
series. 

<p>
The US Postal Service consulted with the Pioneer Project Manger to 
ensure its accuracy. 

<p>
The following inscription was chosen for the stamp: Launched March 1972, 
"Pioneer 10" was the first spacecraft to travel to an outer planet, 
providing data and images of Jupiter. Eleven years later, it became 
the first man-made object to leave the solar system.

<p>
This is not the first time the US has commemorated Pioneer 10
on one of its stamps.  They also did it in 1974.  See this Web
page for details and the image of that Pioneer stamp:
