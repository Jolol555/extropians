Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiologic studies of fruit and
  vegetable intake and bladder cancer risk
  have yielded inconsistent results, especially with regard to the types of
  fruits and vegetables consumed. We examined
  total fruit and vegetable
<br>
  intake, as well as intakes of subtypes of
  fruits and vegetables, in relation to
<br>
  bladder cancer risk in a large male prospective cohort study. METHODS: Two
  hundred fifty-two cases of incident bladder cancer were diagnosed from 1986
  through January 31, 1996, among 47,909 men enrolled in the Health
  Professionals Follow-up Study. Each participant in this cohort completed a
  131-item food-frequency questionnaire in 1986 and subsequently in 1990 and

<OL>
  <li>  We used logistic regression analyses to examine fruit
  and vegetable intake in relation to bladder
  cancer risk, after adjusting for age, history of cigarette smoking, current
  smoking status, geographic region, total fluid intake, and
  caloric intake. RESULTS: We observed a weak, inverse
  association that was not statistically significant between total
  fruit and vegetable intake
  and bladder cancer risk. Intake of cruciferous
  vegetables was inversely associated with risk (relative risk

  <UL>
    <li>  0.49; 95% confidence interval = 0.32-0.75, for the highest category of
  cruciferous vegetable intake compared with
  the lowest), but intakes of yellow or green leafy
  vegetables or carotenoid-rich vegetables
  were not associated with risk. Individual cruciferous
  vegetables, except for coleslaw, were all inversely related
  to bladder cancer risk, but only the associations for broccoli and cabbage
  were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study indicate
  that high cruciferous vegetable consumption may reduce
  bladder cancer risk, but other vegetables and
  fruits may not confer appreciable benefits against this
  cancer.
