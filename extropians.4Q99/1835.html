I am talking about the new testament definition of faith, and perhaps I have
a different interpretation of these things.  But I think the concept of
'faith' would better be translated today as 'self-confidence'.  From what I
remember from my reading is:

<p>
   Don't doubt that the sun will come up tomorrow, have faith.
   Don't fear that you can't make it through the travails of life, have
faith.
<p>
   Don't fear death, have faith.
<br>
   God gave you the ability to perceive and reason, have faith in them, not
in what religious figures tell you.

<p>
JC goes on and on, warning people about those who claim to speak on behalf
of God.

You know how I found this out?  My mother died when I was 15, and the priest
from our church refused to give the funeral oration because my mother did
not attend regularly.  A matter that was settled when my Grandfather donated
10K to the church (and 10K was a lot of money in the early 70's).  Anyway, I
<a name="1837qlink1">passionately hated the church people.  And I found in the bible plenty of
justification for my hatred.
