<a href="3371.html#3385qlink1">&gt;  Is this a universal phenomenon?  Does everyone experience this as a</a><br>
<i>&gt;  traumatic moment, after which you know that your days are numbered?</i><br>

<p>
I had encounters with Death at an early age and again in my early 20s,
due to illness.  Ever since, I have been trying to reconcile a sense of mortality as a quiet presence in daily life.  We biological creatures are so fragile, the skin so thin a defense against the rigors of existence, the bones so prone to breakage and decay.

<p>
And, yet, the encounters have liberated me from a deep fear of Death. Every new day is an affirmation of the act of self-will that activated the bodily machinery to cure itself.  I do wonder how that view will change as age advances, but I plan to live a long time.

<p>
And, thank you Hal, for your honesty and willingness to bring up
this subject.

<p>
Affectionately,
<br>
Kathryn
