<a name="0764qlink1">I'd be interested to see those statistics calculated only over a population
involving the very wealthy (from a western perspective); maybe all those in
the west, whose wealth would make them millionaires in today's money.</a>

<a name="0774qlink1">What I'm thinking is, perhaps by averaging over a very large population,
even a comparatively wealthy one like the US, many people with very poor
access to healthcare are being measured side by side with few people with
extremely good access to healthcare.</a> This is like measuring computing power
at any point in time by measuring the capabilities of all the machines
currently in use, no matter how aged, and averaging over the lot, rather
than just presenting the capabilities of the latest, greatest chips. Not
that I think the rich folk are the latest and greatest (*grimace*).

<a name="0774qlink2"><a href="0692.html#0762qlink2">&gt; We better get that up to one year per year. </a><br>

The first threshold is to get to one year per year, for the hideously
wealthy. Then at least we all have an (albeit slim) chance...</a>
