I had an idea for formalizing the old bit about how debts to parents
cannot be paid back, they must be paid forward. Say your parents pay for
your education. They formalize this as a loan to you, with interest
equal to the rate of inflation of the cost of education. You can't pay
it back to them, but every cent you pay in your children's education is
deducted from that debt. Thus the individual is given a real incentive
(to their credit record) to pay for the ducation of their children.</a>
