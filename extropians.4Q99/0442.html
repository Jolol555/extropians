Angry Young Men is an extremely important book that is especially timely now,
during our current epidemic of violence by and against boys and young men. But
it also expresses insights that I believe will continue to be valid and
important for as far into the future as we can now see. For Aaron Kipnis has
seen deeply not only into troubled boys and adolescents but also into those
aspects of the spirit of our culture and our epoch that have turned an
unprecedentedly large proportion of our boys and young men into the perpetrators
and victims of violence.

<p>
More American boys are killing themselves and each other today, and being killed
by other children and adults than at any other time in this century and than in
any other developed nation on earth. It is vital to the future of our society
and our world that we learn what we adults are doing wrong, both individually
and as a society, in the ways that we raise our boys and relate to each other
and what we can do to correct our mistakes. Reading _Angry Young Men_ would be a
very helpful place to begin in the effort to find answers to those questions. It
is a wonderful book and a major accomplishment, which I hope, will find its way
into as many hands as possible.
