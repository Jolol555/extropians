Hal, don't you think that W3 are your basic values?  Isn't it W3 that says to you
what those "more rewarding" things are?  What if you could push a button and make
overeating and those other things seem like holy sacraments?  I suggest that after
you pushed the button, you would be a different person.  In the future you will be
presented with a large array of such buttons.  Should the person that you are be
uploaded, the array of such buttons becomes almost unlimited, as does the speed of
button pushing.  This is why I often ask, "What do you upload, when you upload?"
