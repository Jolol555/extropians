It seems reasonable, though I too, have no evidence, that thinking employs
the current structural "state" of the brain, and that a backlog of new
experiences of the latest experiential period would require a certain
amount of cellular energy to add them--overlay them--onto the
continuously-revised biostructural substrate.  Energy resources might be
the limiting factor, or it could just be that thinking and revising simply
can't go on at the same time.<a name="1597qlink2">  So thinking has to be turned off.  The

This might tend to explain the strikingly different nature of those other
metal activities that occur while one is asleep.  Perhaps they are confined
to areas of the brain not "out of service for the purpose of revision" , or
perhaps the nature of these mental activities lack some essential feature
of awake thinking, a feature that conflicts with "revising"?</a></a>

<p>
I assert none of this as fact, all is speculation.  Caveat emptor.
