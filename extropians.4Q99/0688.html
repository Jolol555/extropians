be able to remove most of the penalties associated with not working.</a>  

<p>
People who enjoy work would always have stimulating projects to devote
themselves to, and those of us who feel like partying for a few hundred
thousand years should be able to do that at a reasonable standard of
living.  
<br>
And if all that endless leisure gets boring, we can always get</a> some
training and go back to work.
