<i>&gt; [Sean Kenny doesnt] ...remember when I first realised that people were</i><br>
<a href="3484.html#3530qlink1">&gt; mortal, but I can remember the moment about 5 years ago on Summer Holiday in</a><br>
<i>&gt; Ireland, having</i><br>
<i>&gt; picked up a copy of Nano by Ed Regis, turning the pages with a growing</i><br>
<i>&gt; awestruck realisation that there was a chance that I might actually live</i><br>
<i>&gt; forever, and if not me, my children. I've still not quite got over that.</i><br>

<p>
YES!  I was hoping someone would say something like this.  I had such
a realization when I picked up Drexler's Engines of Creation in 1986.
It was a few years after having lost religion, and when I read about
nanoassemblers, it occurred to me that perhaps there really *is* a
way to survive this short earthly life.  Needless to say, it was quite a
stunning moment, the kind that sticks in one's memory, such that one
can recall intricate details of the event, even 14 years later.  spike
