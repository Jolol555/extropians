<p>
I've made an embarrassing misattribution and citation error
in my original post:

<p>
         To Michael Re: Making people passive NOT!

<p>
and now I have to add another post to clutter the List
for the sake of the record and the courtesy of an apology
 which I owe you all.

<p>
[1] To Chuck Kuecker &lt;ckuecker@mcs.net&gt;: your trans-<br>
<p>
      of the Latin Phrase as given is entirely correct.

<p>
[2] To Eugene Leitl &lt;eugene.leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt;:<br>
<pre>
     your Latin translation of Hobbe's English statement is
     almost correct -- the actual Latin proverb (see below)
     is "Homo Homini Lupus" rather than the translation as
     "Homo hominis lupus".  But it is light-years ahead of
     my butchered version.

<br>
[3] To the List: I dislike needless posts as much as you<br>
     and if it wasn't for my error and its compounding,
     there would have been no need for all this.

</pre>
<p>
What went wrong?  First, the LATIN phrase "Homo Homini
Lupus" must be attributed to Plautus (died 184 BC) in his
"Asinaria".  My follow-up research also discovered that, in
fact, this was a popular Roman proverb simply transposed
to "Asinaria" by Plautus.

<p>
Thomas Hobbes used "Man is a wolf to man", not in
"Leviathan" as I believed but in "De cive, Epistola
dedicatoria". Finally, the corruption of the Latin was
accomplished entirely by myself, years ago, in taking
notes in a classroom.  I still use my University notes,
believe it or not, and they have proven -- unlike this
case -- to be a reliable reference.

<p>
I hope this error will not detract from the substance of
my original post (above); I am willing to debate this issue
if anyone feels as strongly about the converse position
as I do my own.

<p>
