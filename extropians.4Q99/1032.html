Kevorkian 960617 960620

<p>
I'm gonna get real sick here-- bear with me.

<p>
I hear that Jack Kevorkian "attended" the suicide, by carbon
monoxide, of a woman named Cohen, from Skokie, Illinois.

<p>
Oh my god, fifty years after WW2 and they're still gassing Jews!

<p>
The Ku Klux Klan will probably give him an honorary membership 
for that stunt.  

<p>
Redundant though-- there's already three K's in JacK KevorKian.

<p>
At least a white hood would improve the ugly old fart's looks!

<p>
But with his hobby it oughta be a BLACK hood.

<p>
If I was as ugly as Kevorkian, *I'd* be suicidal.

<p>
Or I'd wanta kill people.

<p>
The newspapers always say he "attended" a suicide.  Is this like
"attending" a concert?

<p>
Ya know the old antiwar slogan- "What if they held a war and nobody
came?"

<p>
Well, what if they held a suicide, and nobody went?

<p>
He stopped doing it in motel rooms 'cause he always stayed past
checkout time...

<p>
Yeesh.  I can't believe I actually did that in front of an audience.
