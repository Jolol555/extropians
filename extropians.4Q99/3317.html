I think some of the recent posts on the list that I followed about
the supercomputer conference gave an indication that one of the
Beowulf clusters (I think around #42 or so on the fasted SC list,
perhaps being pushed by the ORNL people, sorry I can't be more
specific) was going to be "generally available" for researchers.
If you've got software to run on it Eliezer, I'd be willing to
help negotiate for some time.

I've had some offline discussions with Ken Clements (it is really
nice when you have connections to people who know a field really
well!) and my general conclusion is that transhumanist enclaves
<a name="3320qlink1">could develop (affordable) AI development machines.  The real
trick is letting someone like IBM develop the instruction set
and software.  The limited instruction set they have has</a> to be
<a name="3320qlink2">highly specific for molecular modeling.<a name="3324qlink1">  Have you got a
limited instruction set highly specific for neurohacking?
Things like SetSynapseWeight, CopyAllWeights, CopyNeuroPattern,
etc. come to mind but this really isn't my field.</a></a>

Anders--how come you haven't come up with something like this?

God, you mean there's only two?  Well that sure is a relief,
I thought we were dealing with at least half-a-dozen.
