<p>
Nameless in Cyberspace:
<br>
Anonymity on the Internet

<p>
by Jonathan D. Wallace

<p>
Jonathan D. Wallace publishes Ethical Spectacle, available at
<a href="http://www.spectacle.org/">http://www.spectacle.org/</a>, and is coauthor of Sex, Laws and Cyberspace (New
York: Henry Holt, 1996). He is a software executive and attorney in New
York City.

<p>
Executive Summary

<p>
Proposals to limit anonymous communications on the Internet would violate
free speech rights long recognized by the Supreme Court. Anonymous and
pseudonymous speech played a vital role in the founding of this country.
Thomas Paines Common Sense was Þrst released signed, An Englishman.
Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Madison, Samuel Adams, and others
carried out the debate between Federalists and Anti-Federalists using
pseudonyms. Today, human rights workers in China and many other countries
have reforged the link between anonymity and free speech.

<p>
Given the importance of anonymity as a component of free speech, the cost
of banning anonymous Internet speech would be enor-mous. It makes no sense
to treat Internet speech differently from printed leaþets or books.
