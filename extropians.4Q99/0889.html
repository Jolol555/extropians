<i>&gt; This would be a good opportunity for a new field: education experts.</i><br>

<p>
And this is a field where I think we transhumanists can get in
early. Take Sashas ideas about collaborative filtering and rating,
combine them with the ideas of net based review boards being discussed
in science journal circles, and we can get some interesting
possibilities. Both to earn money, do something useful and maybe apply
transhumanism.

<a href="0888.html#0889qlink2">&gt; An outside source of rating our school standards would be very nice ... but </a><br>
<i>&gt; is it plausible? Would schools stick to it? They barely stick to the </i><br>
<i>&gt; low-standard government ones (I know you're in Europe I mean here in USA).</i><br>

<p>
Don't worry, we have low-standard government schools here too :-) 

<p>
Why would a school stick to an external ratins organisation? Because
it can give it credibility and make it attractive for students; if the
Miami Vegetable University has a lot of seals of approval or can show
that 70% of the students get a high rating by some well renowned
boards, then it will be much more attractive. The problem here might
rather be that the school system doesn't allow people to select
schools, if you always have to go to the nearest school it will not
have any real incentive to get better. However, getting these ideas
into the system might be achievable by starting at the "top", with
adult education, and then let the ideas percolate down into basic
education.
