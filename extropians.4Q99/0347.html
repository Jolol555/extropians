It's amazing that you should bring this up at this particular time. That is
precisely one of the reasons that the NeoSapiens Combine is being formed,
and indeed we hope to receive a good amount of our initial funding from
industry groups. By acting as a general advocacy group for technology in the
public arena (we had not considered the comparison with Greenpeace, but it's
a good one and something I think we could use, if you don't mind), we hope
to make advanced technologies more accepted in society.
