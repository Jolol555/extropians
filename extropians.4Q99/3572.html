I pay $50 a year to be a "Friend of the UCSB Library" (University of
California, Santa Barbara) and this gives me borrowing privileges.
Shelves are open and they don't restrict access to them.

<p>
The one limitation is that I can't request books through inter-library
loan, which is a pain because UCSB is not exactly the jewel of the UC
system, and there are often volumes only available at other libraries.
(Actually UCSB isn't that bad, it was ranked 44th in the U.S. in this
year's U.S. News report.)  It's also annoying when grad students and
faculty take out books for many months at a time, making them unavailable
for others.
