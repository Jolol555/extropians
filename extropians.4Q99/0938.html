Your obvious need to cite particular cases and then generalize them to
ALL cases is not only logically fallacious but suggestive of a painful
personal experience with respect to psychiatric treatment. The same
may be said regarding your gratuitous use of pejorative terms and
references, which as a matter of fact are both reminiscent of the
medically illiterate subculture that verbalizes the same contempt for
professional medicine, and only presents a gangrenous limb at some
ER when the only remedy is amputation.
