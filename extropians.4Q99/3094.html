I agree, though the drinking out of the toilet thing has to go!:)  And I
assume Glen does not mean toy dogs.:)

octopodes for the reasons I gave earlier.  Dogs would be nice to do, though
I think they would be harder in some ways.  Plus more people might see
uplifting them as animal cruelty.

a type of niche exploitation.

Hard to say though, since this is highly speculative.
