Ladies &amp; Jellybeans,

<p>
I came across the idea of a canonical list of texts a while back (on
Transhumantech)? The idea is to set up a centralised database on the web, of
reading lists for every conceivable discipline/science/area of interest. It
would need to be updated by netizens as they saw fit; people with specific
knowledge of a particular area would be able to add/update/criticize reading
lists regarding their area(s) of specialty.

<p>
Anyone who has studied anything (bookish) has had the experience of finding
useless books on subjects, finding mediocre books, and finding the essential
<br>
(canonical) texts to which one will refer as the final arbiter on that<br>
subject. For instance, I have a shelf full of computer science &amp; maths
texts, some of which I cannot live without (in a professional sense).

<p>
What I find irritating is that when I want to move into a different field
<br>
(say physics), how do I begin? What is the definitive "introduction" book?<br>
Where do I go from there. How about if I know a bit about waves/particles,
and a bit of maths, what would be the best book(s) to get me up to speed on
nuclear physics? Often, if you haven't gone into the subject in enough depth
<br>
(true by definition for the beginner), you don't even know what questions to<br>
ask to find out where to start, so a web search for this hazy grail is
incredibly lengthy and probably fruitless.

<p>
What would be useful is something like an annotated master catalog of
university course reading lists. Sometimes the texts are inferior or hard to
come by, but its a good approximation to a canonical texts list. Also I
notice there are lists kicking around the net, but they seem quite
specialised, and without much annotation (just a list of books).

<p>
Does anyone know if the canonical texts database exists? If so, where? If
not, how close an approximation is out there?

<p>
Thanks all &amp; sundry
<br>
Emlyn
