     I took the test and came out Androdyne (I think we had another such test 
that we all took and on that I came out tending slightly to the masculine).  
And I am a Gemini, so they got that right&lt;but I wonder what the signs listed 
under the other categories are&gt;.  I'm not sure how accurate some of my 
scoring was since some of the questions were ones that I would never 
encounter in my normal day-to-day activities (I may have slightly bent the 
results toward the feminine because I kept thinking, "What would I do if I 
were female.").
