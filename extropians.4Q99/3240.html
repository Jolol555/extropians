Yep.  I found this out the hard way.  The best way to have a good credit
rating is to project the profile of an average, boring American.  It
doesn't matter how much money you have or make; if you don't meet their
profile of "normal", you don't get credit.  I always considered myself to
be a good credit risk.  No debt, lots of income, positive net worth, etc.

<p>
After a couple absurd and embarrassing incidents regarding my credit or
lack thereof, I constructed the illusion of having a "normal" financial
profile to see if I could get credit.  Sure enough, two years later I have
all the credit I could possibly use, despite the fact that the only thing
I've changed is the way my profile looks on a computer.  Ridiculous.
