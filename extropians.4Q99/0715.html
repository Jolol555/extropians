SIGH!:-(

<p>
<a name="0790qlink1">One of the main problems of modernity has been in my opinion the lust of 
modernist ideologies to conduct a "coup d'école" through the means of 
compulsory schooling, were entire generations have been forced to learn the 
same thing and NO place was given for diversity or alternal forms</a> of 
education.

<p>
<a name="0790qlink2"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink1">&gt;Teach rationalism in school (arguments against religion etc.</a><br>
<i>&gt;should be mandatory classes). If parents try to sabotage this,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they should receive a stern warning, after which their ass</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be kicked with appropriate force.</i><br>

<p>
Why rationalism? Do you mean a strict Carthesian rationalism (there are 
various kinds of rationalism too, you see)?</a> If so I'm going to have my kid 
<a name="0790qlink3">kicked out of school quickly. Why arguments AGAINST religion, is atheism 
mandatory in civilized countries?</a> If a compulsury schooling is to be upheld 
<a name="0790qlink4">(I abhor it) it really, really has to be neutral on all these matters 
because it has to give the same education to ALL kids- but kids are 
different and come from different environments (and their parents have 
different demands).</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink5"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink2">&gt;Self-defense/mental empowerment classes for everyone, from</a><br>
<i>&gt;a very early age (so that by the time you graduate, you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;practically a Jedi Master). Teach responsible use of firearms</i><br>
<i>&gt;as well as martial arts.</i><br>

<p>
Hey, what if I am a pacifist and completely detest violence and weapons. Do 
I have to let my kid learn about</a> it?

<p>
<a name="0790qlink6"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink3">&gt;Proper, hands-on sex education.</a></a><br>

<p>
Ditto (and what about this hands-on thing?)

<p>
<a name="0790qlink7"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink4">&gt;Gender stereotypes should be avoided as much as possible;</a><br>
<i>&gt;the aim is to create a more androgyne society.</i><br>

<p>
WHOSE aim is it to create a more androgyne society?</a> And why? I personally 
<a name="0790qlink8">will give my kid a masculine education if its a boy and a feminine if its a 
girl (but then what I mean with those terms might be slightly deviant</a> from 
the norm)

<p>
<a name="0790qlink9">Once again there is a danger in limiting education, it closes opportunities 
for students to get into the areas of their choice.</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink10">Education today is aimed to create people for the system. Opening up the 
compulsory schools will create a system for the people.</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink11"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink5">&gt; &gt; Science/Space:</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A Manned/Womaned landing on Mars by 2010.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Self-sustained colonies on the Moon, Mars and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt;in "free space" by 2020-30.</i><br>

<p>
JYMDPJOJEKT! Why these space programs? Either they are profitable and then 
they are not the government's (or a party's) concern or they are not and 
then they should be stopped.</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink12"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink6">&gt;Increase funding for nanotech, genetic engineering</a><br>
<i>&gt;and other (potentially) transhuman technologies.</i><br>

<p>
If nanotech is going to be so profitable, private investers could invest</a> in 
it

<p>
<a name="0790qlink13"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink7">&gt;Manhattan project for human uploading.</a><br>

<p>
Would really everybody be interested in financing this through his/hers/vers 
tax bill.</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink14"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink8">&gt;Intelligence augmentation &amp; life extension to become</a><br>
<i>&gt;national priorities.</i><br>

<p>
Another set of national priorities, but would people really be interested in 
it.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink15"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink9">&gt;Cryonics to receive X billion research budget and</a><br>
<i>&gt;full legal status (recognized as a potentially life-saving</i><br>
<i>&gt;procedure, so no more autopsies, delays in hospitals</i><br>
<i>&gt;or other bureaucratic, deathist nonsense).</i><br>

<p>
Ouch, that X billion has been proven to be VERY, VERY costly to the 
taxpayers. And there is a limit to even my disposition to pay for cryonics. 
Cryonics are not a matter for the government.</a>

<p>
<a href="0668.html#0715qlink10">&gt;Justice:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0790qlink16"><i>&gt;Automate the legal system &amp; prisons as much as possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;No more physical contact between inmates, only minimal</i><br>
<i>&gt;and heavily supervised contact between inmates and guards.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Standard senstences, no juries, binding precedent, no public</i><br>
<i>&gt;trials etc. (see previous posts on this topic).</i><br>

<p>
Why not allow several legal systems?

<p>
<a name="0790qlink17"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink11">&gt;Legalize all victimless crime.</a><br>
</a>

<p>
OK, I'm right with you on this one.</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink18"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink12">&gt;Get tough on real crime (an eye for an eye).</a><br>

<p>
OK, but why "eye for an eye"?</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink19"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink13">&gt;Curb unwanted (illegal) immigration, while attracting people</a><br>
<i>&gt;who are willing and able to contribute to the economy, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't cause trouble.</i><br>

<p>
</a>What is unwanted immigration?<a name="0790qlink20"> Illegal immigration in most rich countries 
today is: people that will have to compensate their lower skills with lower 
pay in order to compete. And really if I'm just a hobo but still would like 
to hike around in the U.S., Sweden, Japan or  Cameroon "just because I like 
it" I should be able to do so.</a> Open up the world for everybody.

<p>
<a href="0668.html#0715qlink14">&gt;Economy:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0790qlink21"><i>&gt;Abolition of work through extensive automation. The aim is</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have generous standard welfare for everyone, while those</i><br>
<i>&gt;who want more can have their own (liberal) sub-economy.</i><br>

<p>
Work will never be abolished.</a> It is economically impossible (well, you could 
be dead...).<a name="0790qlink22"> Who is going to pay for the standard welfare and what is 
</a>generous?<a name="0790qlink23"> What if I'd like my own socialist sub-economy?</a>

<p>
<a name="0790qlink24"><a href="0668.html#0715qlink15">&gt;Taxes are gradually abolished as level of automation increases.</a><br>
<i>&gt;State plays (responsible) pimp and dope dealer (etc.) to</i><br>
<i>&gt;partially finance the transition from wage slave society to</i><br>
<i>&gt;automated welfare society.</i><br>

<p>
I don't understand.</a> Clarify, please.

<p>
<a href="0668.html#0715qlink16">&gt;Healthcare:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0790qlink25"><i>&gt;Free, high-quality healthcare for everyone through automation</i><br>
<i>&gt;and economies of scale.</i><br>

<p>
But diseconomies of scale are shown in the health care sector! Who is going 
to pay for it, automation doesn't solve the problem of costs,</a> it just 
changes it?

<p>
<a href="0668.html#0715qlink17">&gt;General:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0790qlink26"><i>&gt;Make tiered voting system; the more tax you pay (or in some</i><br>
<i>&gt;other way contribute to society), the more voting points you</i><br>
<i>&gt;get. Actually you'd want to create a kind of meritocracy/</i><br>
<i>&gt;technocracy. The right to vote is something that has to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;earned, just like a driver's license.</i><br>

<p>
What is the standard, why that specific standard?</a> Why should I contribute to 
society? The problem is still with this system that some people will have 
<a name="0790qlink27">the political power to force others. I'd rather prefer to be a consumer. The 
citizen votes every four years, the consumer votes every minute.

<p>
OK, I hope that you understand that I not out here to smack you on your head 
but to construct a fruitful discussion and to point out some dangers</a> in your 
replies.

<p>
<a name="0790qlink28">My main criticism is that your response feels so (don't get insulted) 
dated... so very much 20th century.</a> It is inherent of course in discussing a 
<a name="0790qlink29">political party's program.</a> But the feeling that I've gotten in discussing 
<a name="0790qlink30">these things on the Extropy and Omega</a> lists is that we really have more 
<a name="0790qlink31">aptly answers for the future, a future that will be very diverse. In fact I 
think we should be talking about the futures of the menkinds.</a>

<p>
