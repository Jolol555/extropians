Oh come on!  If that were true the first time the child screamed
at the top of its lungs for an hour you would chuck it in the
trash container.

<p>
Parents "love" children because nature has programmed us to do that.
Children are "cute" because nature makes them that way or nature
</a>

makes our perception of "cute" match the image of a child.

This is oversimplified.  I am sure that some subset of the people

<a name="0524qlink4"><a href="0515.html#0519qlink3">&gt; That is true. The idea that everybody can be helped is a fantasy.</a><br>
<a name="0528qlink3"><i>&gt; But it is a fantasy that many people believe.</i><br>

<p>
It isn't a fantasy.  The problem is with the belief that "help"
has a universal form.  In one situation "helping" a person may
be to assist in the termination of their life, in another situation
"helping" may be to fight tooth and claw to prevent them from doing so.

<p>
The fantasy is that there are "universal" answers.</a></a>

<i>&gt; Instead she argued that people should help each other for</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfectly selfish reasons.</i><br>

<p>
Well in this case you end up with a very conflicted system.
If you say "in my selfishness", I am going to help everyone
live forever in such a way that we are all equal that is
very different from saying "in my selfishness", I want to
control all the matter and energy in our solar system.

<p>
While  the "Virtues of Selfishness" may be a guiding principle for
individuals, it must assume that there is never a situation
in which a single individual is able to gain control of
sufficient resources to eliminate the other individuals.
If that is possible, then the virtues are self-defeating.
