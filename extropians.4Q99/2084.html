&lt;&lt; I urge us to take the evil transhuman page with a cool sense of
 humor.  god knows, *we* have slain a few sacred cows on
 *our* chat site, all while suppressing gleeful laughter.  {8^D
 Lets cut em some slack.  Actually, I detect some actual attempts
 at subtle humor in there.  {8-]  spike

    Definitely Spike, he was not about to argue a case that he has no passion 
for defending.  This guy could obviously care less.  I completely caught the 
humor in the complete irony of the situation and he was playing it up too 
intending us to get a big laugh at it.  I found his reply to be disarming and

attend the next Extro.
