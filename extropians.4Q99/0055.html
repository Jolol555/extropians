When we think of machines we often see gears, shafts, connecting links,
piping, wires, valves, switches, etc.  The molecular machine of the cell
is, in contrast, a long, folded, linear array of amino acids, so its
mechanistic nature is almost certainly to be of a uniquely different, and
to our experience novel, character.  When one moves beyond the false mental
image of this "machine" as a static lump--and image fostered by the
inherently static nature of pictures and other visual depictions in common
use--and tries to envision the dynamic operation of this machine, a rich
suite of possibilities presents itself.  The configuration of the linear
array is potentially immensly multivariate.  It (does or can) wiggle throb,
twist, stretch, and slide over itself,  all the while creating highly
dynamic regions adjacent to, between, and beneath the moving strands, as
well around and between the larger dynamically polymorphic clumps.
