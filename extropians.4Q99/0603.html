Robert,

<p>
I'm not going to reply to specific statements because I have only
one major point to make:

<p>
          You have significantly contributed to my education.

<p>
While my questions, implicit and explicit, were in no sense "rhetorical"
the post was deliberately composed as a "Socratic" inquiry, which does
include a bit of irony.  But your responses, defending as they do the
work and gestalten of Extropians in such a responsible manner, are of
the greatest value to me.  They have been archived in my "Extropian"
Directory. Thank you, as well as the others, who are serving as my
mentors.
