Aubrey de Grey is a learned, innovative and superbly graceful writer on the
topic of aging, and an acknowledged expert researcher at Cambridge
University. His long-awaited book is now out.

It is described at amazon.com as to be published in February, but this is
incorrect -- it is available now.  It covers most aspects of mitochondria
and free radicals as they relate to aging, including extensive background
information (enough, I hope, that the scientifically-minded non-biologist
will be able to cope with it).  There is also detailed discussion of some
perhaps-imminently-feasible life-extension interventions.

I haven't read it yet, but hope to do so soon.
