Subject: Can Apricot Seeds stop cancer?


<p>
There are many web sites out there that are showing that the answer to =
cancer has been known. Some of the companies that tell the truth about =
cancer are Christian Brothers, Something 4U and World Without Cancer =
Inc. These companies have been showing the evidence that when a person =
adds bitter seeds to their diet which contain the vitamin B17, they will =
not get cancer any time in their life. These companies also show that =
after a person has been diagnosed with cancer, simply adding seeds and =
vitamin B17 to their diet can shrink the tumors and will protect the =
rest of the persons body. Some of these companies have hundreds of =
success records posted right on their web site with phone numbers and =
addresses for others to contact. In almost all of the cases that these =
websites record, blood pressure is lowered and blood sugar levels =
improve.
<br>
The websites show that a person should not only depend on the B17 and =
Seeds, but also clearly states that individuals should include other =
nutritious immune system building foods in their diet.\~It also shows =
that a person who still decides to stay on chemo and takes the apricot =
seeds live many times longer then if they took the chemo alone.
The FDA has made it very difficult for companies to advertise =
information concerning Vitamin B17 and the Apricot seeds. To order =
apricot seeds, or complete information concerning this subject or to ask =
a few questions, call 1-800-395-7379. To do a search on apricot seeds =
click here and then type in apricot seeds in the appropriate spot. =

pricot+seeds+cancer=20
<br>
If this is your first time ordering, order one of the packages which =
includes one bottle of the B17, one pound of the apricot seeds, the =
book, the video, the journal and complete instructions

<p>
You may order by credit card by calling 800-395-7379

Book: World Without Cancer, by Edward Griffin
Contains most of what's mentioned in the videotape 'World Without =
Cancer' and much more on studies that were covered up and great =
scientist who where arrested when they began telling others about the =
truth with vitamin B17. Highly annotated for the serious student who =
wants to research the information for himself. Contains studies on =
Amygdalin (vitamin B17, laetrile) that were conducted at the famous =
cancer institute, Sloan Kettering and covered up. Full explanation of =
the politics of cancer from Mr. Edward Griffin.

<p>
Videotape: "World Without Cancer" Length 55 min.
By Edward Griffin. Features how the answer to cancer has always been =
known and was pushed out of the U.S. This video will blow you away. It =
brings to light in an organized and simple to understand fashion the =
politics of cancer, the scandal, the biologics scientifics, the cultures =
that have never had a case of cancer and some success =
stories...including my own which was featured on Inside Edition's Extra =
in 1996. $19.95

<p>
Apricot Kernels
<br>
These seeds have the highest content of B-17 on earth. These are not the =
same as the ones that are sometimes found in the health food stores. The =
ones in the health food store are sun- dried. Sun dried kernels are not =
effective, that's why they're allowed to be sold in U.S. stores without =
problem. Our kernels are fresh, chewable and bitter and a necessity in =
out diet. Dr. Krebs says 7 per day for absolute prevention. As therapy =
for existing cancer, between 20 and 50 per day is recommended. Although =
they are bitter, they must be integrated into our diets. Stores do not =
sell fresh apricot seeds because of what the FDA did years ago. $12.95 =
per pound, approx. 860 seeds per pound already cracked out of the shell.

<p>
Vitamin B-17
<br>
Fruit seed extract is called Amygdalin, Vitamin B17 or Laetrile. We =
carry this vitamin in tablet form in 100mg and 500mg quantities. They =
are 99% pure fruit seed extract from Cyto Pharm of Mexico. Cyto Pharma =
of Mexico are the pioneers of the seed extraction of Vitamin B17 for =
over 20 years.. They are the only ones who have followed Dr. Krebs exact =
specifications for the production of vitamin B17. For prevention the =
100mg capsules are recommended by Dr. Krebs, one or two per day; If =
existing cancer is the case, between 2000-4000mg for the first 30 days =
is recommended along with 2-5 seeds per hour (waking hours). $95 per 100 =
500 mg tablets. $34 per 100 of the 100 mg tablets.
