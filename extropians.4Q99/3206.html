This seems true to me.  I would be hard pressed to think of a situation

<p>
in which I would resort to violence unless my survival were threatened.

<p>
But on the other hand, if you told me I could kill you and take all your

<p>
property and have to pay no penalties for this (other than wrestling with

<p>
my guilty conscience) then I might begin to entertain such thoughts.

<p>
Interestingly enough if there is *no* possibility of penalties

<p>
(i.e. the golden rule gets exempted), then it would only be rational

<p>
for me to kill you if you happen to have more resources at your disposal

<p>
than I do.  In fact it is rational to kill you up until the point

<p>
that the benefits that I derive from doing so become less than

<p>
the effort that it takes to do so.  Interesting that a "rational"

<p>
argument can result in immoral actions if you eliminate the

<p>
self-interest of being treated morally.


<p>
If we look at the examples of gay or race bashing they almost always

<p>
involve a majority ganging up on a minority.  Three white men tying

<p>
a black man to the back of a truck and dragging him to death???

<p>
Sounds like both a numbers and a technology advantage (or at least

<p>
technology that distances you from actually getting your hands dirty).

<p>
What was irrational here was whatever pursuaded them to think they

<p>
would get away with it.



<p>
None of this has anything to do with rational or irrational... you are 
talking about logical or illogical.

<p>
In order for it to be a rational situation there would have to be a reason 
for the men to tie the victim up and drag him to his death.

<p>
There is no sane reason for this, so carrying out the action because they 
felt they could not get caught was making a logical decision based on an 
irrational situation.
