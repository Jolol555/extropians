Actually, in Eli's scenario the rapid change is a product of superhuman
intelligence.  The nanotech is just a convenient tool for the SI to use - if
there weren't any such thing you would still get a Singularity, it would
just take a little longer.</a>

<a name="2243qlink2">I know that newcomers usually go through a phase where they think there will
be  a 'Nanotech Day' when suddenly you can do anything, but they usually get
over it after a few months.  I don't know of any serious thinkers who hold
to this view - do</a> you?

Oops.  Sorry.  That's what I get for typing URLs from memory.
