Wanting to reduce your sex drive is not a healthy desire in my opinion. I
think that even an unsatisfied sex drive is better then none at all.
Emotions, especially of the sexual type, drive you to do strange things
sometimes, and get in the way of things you'd rather be doing. I used to
wish I wasn't as horny as I am, didn't feel things as deeply as I did, and
didn't think as much as I did.. but I realized these impulses (impulses to
repress drives) are of the same sort as the suicidal impulse. It's a lot
easier not to think about sex, in the same way that it's a lot easier to be
dead then alive.</a> I think you're cheating yourself if you try to kill or
<a name="0785qlink2">lessen your sex drive, and you'll be a happier person in the long run if you
don't. The only people who should consider this reduction are people with
desires that are as dangerous as they are intense (pedophiles, people with
rape fantasies), and need to do so to prevent themselves from causing harm.</a>
