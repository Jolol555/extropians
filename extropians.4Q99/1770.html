<a href="1692.html#1770qlink1">&gt;I would offer that the evidence for "No God", i.e. athiesm is weak.</a><br>
<i>&gt;The question revolves around "What is God?".  If I choose to define</i><br>
<i>&gt;"God" as the creator of Earth (an alien ET SI running an experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt;performing an occasional miracle) then there isn't much evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt;available to say that isn't true.</i><br>

<p>
More importantly, there's none to say that it is true, and the
responsibility for proof lies with the proposer. Otherwise, I could propose
that everything was made by a big mac and fries on the clouds that gives me
everything I want (in a non-measurable sense, of course), then back it up
with "You can't disprove it!!".
<br>
Then of course, I'd start "educating" YOUR children with the big mac
religion, and you'd be given a bad-sounding "-ist" to wear on your head,
should you complain.
<br>
There is no "disprove it!", this is not rational.......after all - do you
think you can disprove my big-mac that demands blind irrational faith and so
hides? How can you do it when there are no premises or base observations to
scrutinise?
<br>
What there is though, is a MASSIVE and totally transparent motive to make
any old crap up, and delude myself - hey, I can magic away all my greatest
fears, and give existence "meaning" in one fell swoop......yahoo!
