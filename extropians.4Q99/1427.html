<p>
Hmm... If I remember the Cobe data right, the variations are rather
large, several degrees across in the sky.</a> This means that the
<a name="1435qlink2">congregations have to be very large (otherwise, they have to be close
to us, and we should both see effects of them being inside our galaxy
or local group (= anisotropies in the distribution), and a certain
level of granularity would be expected).</a> If these concentrations are
<a name="1435qlink3">very large, then we have the same problem of causal connection again -
how could the SIs have become similar over vast distances?</a> 

<p>
<a name="1435qlink4">So the SI theory for the background radiation has the problem that
either the SIs are close to us, but then they have to be so many that
they look like a dense mist in the infrared, or more remote and then
they run into the same causality problem of how they could have
coordinated their temperatures given the finite speed of light and the
short age of the universe.</a> Another, perhaps bigger problem, is that if
the anisotropies are due<a name="1435qlink5"> to SIs, the natural background radiation is
</a>
going to be even smoother<a name="1435qlink6"> - and astrophysicists already have trouble
with reconciling this level of smoothness with pattern formation.</a>

<a href="1421.html#1427qlink2">&gt; Oooppps, sub-SI-Anders falls into the pit of "conventional wisdom"</a><br>
<i>&gt; and the *assumption* that the *simplest* explanation is that the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; has no intelligence or evolution to the limits of physics to explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; those pesky "observations".</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1435qlink7">Actually, I would say in this case Occam is on my side ("Ho ho ho, now
I got a razor..." :-), because the theory that the background
radiation is mostly natural is much simpler than assuming SIs with
some form of long-range coordination - that model introduces a
tremendous number of new unknowns (like why some do and others don't
radiate at a low temperature).</a>

<p>
Actually, I'm right now undertaking just a 2 week penance to update my
web pages using my recently acquired Dreamweaver 2 program... of
course, I don't view it as penance but a reward :-)
