Oh Hell no, I am merely arguing against the mentality the Mr. Burch finds so 
disheartening.  I also persist in being a pain in the gluteus because it 
seems that  people who object to religion do so exclusively, from a  
Christian perspective.  Yes sheol was a burning trash heap of ancient times, 
but it may have been the location of early Caannite and Hebrew sacrifices-bad 
vibrations.  The Hell of the Christian is purportedly eternal, which tells 
one about their view of &lt;God&gt;, and the necessity to conform to their edicts 
(historically speaking) so where am I on this?  The purpose of nuking people 
eternally in some permanent convention oven is a bout as sensible as  biting 
on a ball of aluminum foil.  I hope that Extropianism or TransHumanism 
doesn't devolve to being mono-cultural
