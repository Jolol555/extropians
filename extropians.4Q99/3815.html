For those of you interested in this, there is a good article in
the December Scientific American, "How the Brain Creates the Mind"
by Antonio R. Damasio (pg 112).   He is the author of "Decartes'
Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain", and "The Feeling
of What Happens", two books that are now high on my list.

<p>
He discusses the "Movie in the Mind" aspect of consciousness
and the fact that our "self"-concept may arise as an emergent
property of the brain recreating the sensory environment.

<p>
For those of you who are lacking something to do (do we have
people like that on this list?), the Dec. Scientific American
and the 2 Dec. 1999 issue of Nature (in a supplement, "Impacts of
forseeable science"), are both jammed with stuff of interest
to us - Robots, Genomes, Space, Climate, etc.  I'd list both
of them as "required reading" for future extropians.
