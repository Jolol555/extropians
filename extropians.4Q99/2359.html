<a href="2339.html#2359qlink1">&gt; Or in much simpler terms, and leaving out the objective morality:  If</a><br>
<i>&gt; you *want* something, then you want a part of the Universe to change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, what you want is also a part of the Universe, and you can want to</i><br>

Sounds like what Frankfurt wrote about: first-order desires and second-order
desires.  First-order desires are those we simply/immediately have.
Second-order desires refer to other desires.

<p>
This necessitates self-awareness and introspection.  It is the ability to
have second-order desires that Frankfurt proposes as the definition for a
"person" (as opposed to a "human"), labeling those who cannot as "wantons".

<p>
It seems to me that this is a similar problem to that addressed by
second-order cybernetics.  Having no knowledge of the field, however, it's
just a speculation...  Anyone with more info care to comment?

<p>
Thanks,

<p>
Leonardo
