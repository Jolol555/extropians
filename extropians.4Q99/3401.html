Hi folks

<p>
I'm relieved to announce that my &gt;H popular science book THE SPIKE,
published in Australia a couple of years back, will<a name="3405qlink1"> be bought by a New York
publisher who hope to have it out in hard cover by the end of 2000</a> (in a
slightly revised/updated edition).

<p>
So much has happened since I wrote the book 3 years ago that revisions
*are* needed, although at first I found this amusing - the emphasis is so
heavily on life 25, 50 and more years away. But I'll be scouring the urls
in my archive of Gina's posts, Eureka, etc, for the most telling latest
examples.

<p>
Meanwhile, I'd be very grateful if anyone here who's read the book would
<a name="3680qlink1">send my their suggestions or corrections. Some have already done so, or
reviewed the book, but I'd be happy to take on board any advice, including
structural kvetching. I want to make this book as good as it can</a> be!

<p>
(Send messages off-list, of course, to avoid unsightly clutter...)

<p>
All best, Damien Broderick
