Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic data on the possible benefit of eating fish to
  reduce the risk of coronary heart disease have been
  inconsistent. We used data from the Chicago Western Electric Study to examine
  the relation between base-line fish consumption and the 30-year risk of death
  from coronary heart disease. METHODS: The study participants
  were 1822 men who were 40 to 55 years old and free of
  cardiovascular disease at base line. Fish
  consumption, as determined from a detailed dietary history, was stratified
<br>
  (0, 1 to 17, 18 to 34, and &gt; or = 35 g per day). Mortality from coronary<br>
  heart disease, ascertained from death certificates, was
  classified as death from myocardial infarction (sudden or nonsudden) or death
  from other coronary causes. RESULTS: During 47,153 person-years of follow-up,
  there were 430 deaths from coronary heart disease; 293 were
  due to myocardial infarctions (196 were sudden, 94 were nonsudden, and 3 were
  not classifiable). Cox proportional-hazards regression showed that for men
  who consumed 35 g or more of fish daily as compared with those who consumed
  none, the relative risks of death from coronary heart
  disease and from sudden or nonsudden myocardial infarction
  were 0.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.94) and 0.56 (95 percent
  confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.93), respectively, with a graded relation
  between the relative risks and the strata of fish consumption (P for trend =
  0.04 and 0.02, respectively). These findings were accounted for by the
  relation of fish consumption to nonsudden death from myocardial infarction
<br>
  (relative risk, 0.33; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.91; P for<br>
  trend= 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: These data show an inverse association between
  fish consumption and death from coronary heart disease,
  especially nonsudden death from myocardial infarction.
