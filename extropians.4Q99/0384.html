says 

<pre>
        Three Italian doctors warn in a letter published in Thursday's
        New England Journal of Medicine that glycyrrhizic acid, the
        active ingredient in licorice, suppressed sex hormone levels</a> in
        seven men</a> in their 20s.

        Just 7 grams of licorice a day over four days was enough to
        reduce the amount of testosterone by an average of 44 percent.
        Hormone levels returned to normal after four days of abstinence,
        said the team led by Dr. Decio Armanini of the University of
        Padua.

        [...]

        ``The amounts of licorice given to these men are eaten by many
        people,'' they said. ``Thus, men with decreased libido or other
        sexual dysfunction ... should be questioned about licorice
        ingestion.''

<p>
Many other benefits and very few contraindications are claimed for
licorice.  See, for example

can't vouch for the credibility of this site -- anyone have a favorite
guide to herbal medicines on the net?)
