<a href="0021.html#0042qlink1">&gt; I've got a few [applied] math credits but no degrees.</a><br>
<i>&gt; Since that club includes people like Bill Gates and Larry Ellison,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't mind the company.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Other than situations, where the necessity of dealing with monopolies</i><br>
<i>&gt; where a degree is required (lawyers, doctors and to a lesser degree</i><br>
<i>&gt; universities), why would you ever want to be a member of a club that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would admit you?  :-)</i><br>

<p>
In some enlightened states where the old boy's club of the state bar
assosiation doesn't have quite so strong a stranglehold, it is possible
to become a practicing attorney without paying tribute to law school
just by passing the bar exam.

<p>
Medical schools and the AMA, though, still have a monopoly on
practicing medicine, although many specific procedures have been
moved out of that realm and into the hands of nurses and techs.
It is also possible--though strongly discouraged and very hard--
to be admitted to medical school without a bachelor's degree.
I've considered doing that myself, and probably would if I could
scrape together the money to quit work for that long.
