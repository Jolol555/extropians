<a name="0623qlink2"><i>&gt; honesty to openly treat people as objects to be manipulated? and how, </i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly, is 'treating people as other living beings like oneself' </i><br>
<i>&gt; incompatible with 'treating people as objects to be manipulated'?</a> </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0623qlink3">What's honest about it? You either treat people as objects
or you don't. Some people do some people don't. I am not
even sure choice comes into to a large degree.</a>

<p>
<a name="0623qlink4">The way you describe yourself does make you sound like you
would be classified as having one or another of the personality 
disorders as defined by DSM-IV. Of course Aspergis (highfunctioning
 autistics) also tend to treat people as if they
were objects.</a>

<p>
<a name="0623qlink5">Its a logical falicy to believe that acting in one's own
interests also implies that you must treat other's as
objects to be manipulated.</a>

best, patrick
