Remember, the old WHO tune from the early 1970's Retro-fans "Oh the parting 
on the left, is now parting on the right.."  I guess being Extropian of 
TransH depends on one criteria only and that is what I call The Arc of 
Technological Capability.  What can we do and when?  The answer seems to be 
to the former, Just about Anything; and to the later Hells Own Time.  Both 
enthusiasts in Extropianism and TransH are counting on unparalleled, 
breakthroughs to alter the human condition for the better.

Maybe...maybe.  But what is readilly achievable and/or affordable depends on 
many, many factors;  and that its difficult to predict when a laboratory 
curiosity will become the next insanely, great thing?  I do, however, see 
that both groups are on the right track , if not precisely on target; never 
fear, so are the Climatologists, Economists, that inhabit our splend section 
of the universe.
