I see your point.  The early part of that film is more convincing
than the second: the brutal conditions under which the allies
invaded at Normandy, right in the face of the Nazi guns, DAMN!
That would make a pacifist of the most staunch hawk.

<p>
It did strain credibility: in real life, a mutinies are rarer than
hens teeth, yet captain Tom Hanks had 4 of them directly
under him.  One was a *private* telling a *captain* no, I
wont go.  That wouldnt happen anywhere but Hollywood,
yet the message of the film is moving and in a way extropian,
for we are standing on a threshold of a dream:  We can
*finally* do away with this madness of men on a field
shooting lead at each other.

<p>
This brutal  and devastating style of fighting is finally coming
<a name="1609qlink1">to an end, as was shown in Desert Storm.  The foot soldier
is obsolete.<a name="1627qlink2">  War can be taken directly to the front door of the
alphas who ordered up the war to start with, leaving
the rest of us alive and uninjured.</a>

<p>
Is this not an extropian dream?</a>  spike
