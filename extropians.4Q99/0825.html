Robin Hanson once suggested that actually what you are paying for in
the big-name colleges is not a superior education, but rather the
contacts and reputation which you gain.  The Harvard grad will have an
advantage for the rest of his life by putting that degree on his resume.
But even more, the people he knew, both professors and fellow students,
are likely to be able to supply him with contacts, references, and job
opportunities which will give him a leg up throughout his career.

<p>
This has certainly been in accordance with my own experience.  I graduated
from a top-rank science/engineering college (in fact the highest ranked
college in the US in the recent Business Week survey), and the people I
met there got me three out of the four jobs I've held.  My current job
is the only one I've achieved without benefit of my college background,
and even there I was lucky enough to have gotten involved years ago with
a guy who went on to form his own company and wanted to hire me.

<p>
It sounds cynical, but as they say success in life is often a matter of
knowing the right people.  Going to a top school is one of the best ways
of getting to know people who are likely to turn out to be important and
helpful to you.

<p>
On-line education may catch on and be successful, but it will never
replace the prestige institutions.  They actually sell a completely
different service, and it is important not to be confused and think they
are there primarily to provide an education.
