Hello everyone,

<p>
I want to share with you all an online comics site that has some really 
great art and stories with somewhat extropian themes.  I am talking about 
the electric sheep webcomics site.  It is located at e-sheep.com and is 
really worth a look.  By looking in their archive you will find a story 
called "Chrysalis Colossus" which in sort of an H.P. Lovecraft way tells a 
tale of travelling through time and space to glimpse the great wonders of 
the future.

<p>
"The Guy I Almost Was" is also a terrific story though much longer.  It 
reminded me of myself in many ways.  It tells of a young man growing up who 
thought the future he would grow up in would be a technological utopia with 
wild parties like those in the late sixties and early seventies.  What he 
finds is quite different.  The story also has some interesting observations 
about the cyberhacker age.

<p>
Please tell me what you all think of the stories.  I think they're classics.


<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
