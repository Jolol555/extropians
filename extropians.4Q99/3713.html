IF you all are interested in extreme homosexual behavior in the animal 
kingdom, I suggest tracking down some film footage of the obedoe chimpanzees 
(I think they are an isolated species located in Borneo or some remote 
region such as).  Their entire social community revolves and is driven by 
sex.  Grandparents with grandchildren, moms with daughters, major orgies 
with the whole family and the neighbors.  They resolve any and all social 
disputes with some good tension releasing humping.  I was doing a film 
project and ordered about twenty minutes of stock footage from National 
Geographic.  The filmmaker threw a bunch of sugar cane to the troop and let 
them hump it out over who would get to eat the most.  Tey take "kiss and 
make up" a few steps further.

I must confess that perhaps one of the most emotionally confused moments in 
my life was when a few of my drunken friends and I popped in the video tape 
and watched it on a big screen TV.  The combination of extreme ape porn, 
alcohol, my girlfriend, and drunken friends all in the same room, set off a 
state of qualia like no ther I've ever experienced.
