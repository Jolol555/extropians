<a name="3465qlink1">This interests me greatly, because Robin Hanson objected a couple of years
ago that my treatment of the Wonders of the Nano Future in THE SPIKE is
inconsistent - I claimed that matter compilers and the like will
permit/encourage a gift economy utopia (with a bit of luck), whereas the
prospect of uploads (where I simultaneously take Robin's vivid
extrapolations seriously) would put savage pressure on resources,
foreclosing the former option. (I think that's what he was telling me.)</a>

<p>
My brutish unmathematical mind tends to side with Anders in this debate.
But maybe I've misunderstood him as well. (I also suspect that the kind of
mad-dog ravening exponential runaway that *could* happen under, say,
Robert's scenarios changes everything so wildly that *anything* we say
makes no difference - Eliezer's long-held position, of course.)</a>

Any comments?
