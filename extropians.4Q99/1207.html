Yah, I believe she changed her name because she was ashamed of her Jewish 
<a name="1256qlink1">heritage. Since she was born in Mother Russia, so i'm guess'in</a> that Alisha or 
<a name="1211qlink3">some varient was her birth name and maybe not precisely the English,</a> Alice. 
<a name="1211qlink4">Where "Ayn" comes from I don't know.</a> Her views and values ain't mine since 
<a name="1211qlink5">they all appear to be conjured out of whole cloth rather then empirical.

Suprising for such a rationalist.
