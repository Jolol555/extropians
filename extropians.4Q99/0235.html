<i>&gt;Date: Mon, 4 Oct 1999 02:48:45 EDT</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Was wondering what people thought of the idea of a borganism, originally</i><br>
<i>&gt;multiples, which would have units in physical space and cyberspace.  We'll</i><br>
<i>&gt;keep our initial borganism down to two units for now.  Let's say we start</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a cryo patient that we want to upload, and the patient couldn't decide</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether to become just software or to get a new body, so they do both.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;personalities of our cyber unit (C-unit) and physical unit (P-unit) start </i><br>
<i>&gt;out</i><br>
<i>&gt;identical, and we use some heavy telecommunications hardware and software </i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;keep a high bandwidth comm channel between the two, through which they</i><br>
<i>&gt;exchange memories realtime, but any other data is carefully vetted (on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;theory that it is safer to have a false memory than a false personality</i><br>
<i>&gt;download) by conscious introspection.  What do you think it would be like </i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be this borganism?  How closely connected would they have to be to truly </i><br>
<i>&gt;stay</i><br>
<i>&gt;one.  If they started diverging personalities, how would it affect their</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense of identity given that they operate in such different environments?</i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, I could see our borganism interpreting differences in</i><br>
<i>&gt;personality between the C-unit and P-unit as how it feels in different</i><br>
<i>&gt;situations (yah know, I'm much more artistic in c-space than in p-space, </i><br>
<i>&gt;but</i><br>
<i>&gt;I like having a custom body out here in p-space all to myself, helps with </i><br>
<i>&gt;my</i><br>
<i>&gt;current experiments, though I do most of the modeling in c-space).  What</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be the advantages and disadvantages to trying for the best of all</i><br>
<i>&gt;worlds?</i><br>

<p>
When you talk about not transferring some memories, what memories would they 
be?

<p>
If information is exchanged real time then it would be one consciousness 
because that is how consciousness works on the physical level (exchange of 
information) I see no difference here.  With some memories or sensations not 
exchanged I see a consciousness of a partial split personality.  Slightly 
different thoughts based on physical sensations but problem solving between 
the two worlds would be done in parrallel.  With information being 
transmitted in real time the consciousness would be one.

<p>
Unless the real time exchange is a serial exchange such as the experience of 
conscious thought.  Then it would be two different conscousnesses capable of 
ESP communication.

<p>
It depends on how the information is transfered.
