<i>&gt;&gt; I would maintain, that engaging in sexual activities for non-procreation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; purposes is *unnatural* (i.e. it is not in the direct interest of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; genes), unless you are getting paid for it in some way (this may</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; include social contacts, indirect economic benefits, general well being</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; from the "rewards" of physical pleasure, etc.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Any biologist will tell you that homosexuality is found in all species of</i><br>
<i>&gt; mammal higher than a cat.  Maybe all these species are acting "unnaturally"</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to your definition, but I would suggest you find a different term.</i><br>

    well, speaking from personal experience, my girlfriend's mother had a
cat (fixed, by the way) that used to regularly engage in sexual activity
with one of the neighborhood skunks. the skunk never seemed to object.
absolutely true, swear to [god].
<p>
    i don't really see [natural] as a particularly useful description,
except in poetry. all that exists is [natural], because it exists in
[nature]. [nature] includes all that is. as i see it, behavior can be
described as survival-oriented, non-survival-oriented and
irrelevant-to-survival. these descriptions are, of course, situational at
best.
<p>
    for example: wearing a bulletproof vest in compton at night is
survival-oriented behavior. wearing a "white power" t-shirt in compton is
non-survival-oriented behavior. wearing a grey t-shirt in compton is
irrelevant-to-survival behavior.
<p>
    in closing, i must say that i think the assumption that all behavior can
be directly correlated with a specific genetic sequence is, to say the
least, premature. we are more than our genes.
