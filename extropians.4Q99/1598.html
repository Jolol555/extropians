<i>&gt; amount of cellular energy to add them--overlay them--onto the</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuously-revised biostructural substrate.  Energy resources might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; the limiting factor, or it could just be that thinking and revising simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't go on at the same time.</i><br>

<p>
Actually, I don't think so. First, the brain uses a lot of the body's
energy all the time, and while memory encoding seems to increase the
metabolism (support: PET imaging of people in memory tasks and that
higher levels of oxygen, glucose or ALC increases memory encoding
success) it doesn't seem *that* expensive (maybe I'm wrong, maybe we
sleep because otherwise memory consolidation all at once would cook
our brains :-). Second, we seem to do some memory encoding even when
we are awake (I can remember the bus trip to my office this morning,
and I haven't slept in between). 

<p>
<i>&gt; So thinking has to be turned off.  The</i><br>
<a href="1538.html#1598qlink2">&gt; brain's version of "Please excuse the delay while we update our records."</a><br>
<i>&gt; This might tend to explain the strikingly different nature of those other</i><br>
<i>&gt; metal activities that occur while one is asleep.  Perhaps they are confined</i><br>
<i>&gt; to areas of the brain not "out of service for the purpose of revision" , or</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps the nature of these mental activities lack some essential feature</i><br>
<i>&gt; of awake thinking, a feature that conflicts with "revising"?</i><br>

<p>
Mayhaps. It is rather hard to run a neural network while it is also
doing unsupervised learning, it can easily get caught in an attractor
and learn it to the exclusion of everything. So I think it makes sense
to turn off a lot of functions (especially motor activity) during
sleep.
