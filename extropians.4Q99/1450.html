<a href="1054.html#1450qlink1">&gt;BTW did anyone here attend the Foresight Conference on nanotech last</a><br>
<i>&gt;weekend?  How was it?</i><br>

<p>
 In contrast to prior Foresight conferences, this one was dominated almost
entirely by professional researchers who have accomplished something
involving nanoscale chemistry/physics, although it was often unclear
whether their research was relevant to building molecular assemblers.
There were much fewer visionaries looking a decade or more into the future.
 
<p>
 Chapter 2 of Nanomedicine provides a very comprehensive survey of research
that may be relevant to building assemblers, and no summary of the conference
talks can compete well enough with that chapter to be worth attempting.
