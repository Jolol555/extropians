<a href="2601.html#2624qlink1">&gt;In that case it seems that there is a risk that SIs will develop their own</a><br>
goals (just as we do)

<p>
No way do we develop our own goals. If an "intelligent" chess program
devises a move that will result in a piece being taken, it may seem that the
program has spontaneously decided to take the piece. It has not. It is
<a name="2655qlink1">following it's program to win the game, this is it's root motivation, and it
is far from free - it was strictly defined by the game creator and is
therefore completely invariable.</a>
<br>
<a name="2655qlink2">Our base motivations are also strictly defined and completely invariable.
Any action we devise to fulfil these goals, is just that - an intelligent
system devising a method of achieving<a name="2641qlink1"> the strictly defined goals.</a>
</a>
And as for absolute morality - the concept is utterly meaningless. Just make
an attempt to decompose it. You will fail. It's abstract symbolic concept
does not have a counterpart outside of our minds.
