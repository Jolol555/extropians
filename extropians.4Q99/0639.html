Sayke, since you have a lively sense of humor, I'm going to assume that
some of your statements are ironical and provocative.</a> The essential motive
<a name="0682qlink3">for my posts is a desire to engage in "networked cognition"</a> for the analysis
<a name="0682qlink4">of difficult social issues. "Individualism Reconsidered" by David</a> Reismann some
<a name="0682qlink5">years ago was an early effort to discover whether "self-determination" in
the context of a densely interdependent social matrix, i.e. contemporary
technological society, had any real meaning.</a>

<p>
<a name="0682qlink6">So think about this: is "Extropian Commune" an oxymoron?</a>

<p>
<a name="0682qlink7">For example, in the event of massively disruptive social sabotage by any
current terrorist organization (and I am in a position to know</a> that there is
<a name="0682qlink8">no workable firewall in place, that we are totally vulnerable to e.g.</a> Anthrax
<a name="0682qlink9">agents and small plutonium-based ordinance), could Extropians organize
small communes that required intense cooperation with an emphasis on
group rather than self actualization?  Is there any alternative here to
a paramilitary model requiring the imposition of discipline when necessary?</a>
