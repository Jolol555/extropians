I recommend we all put "UPL" before posts on uplifting to make reading email
and the archives easier.

Not an original point.  This came up in the last debate and, if anyone was
paying attention, my lead question in this thread was based on this concern.
(Of course, I was terse, but that's my nature.)

That's a very big issue and I subscribe to the Randian/</a>Objectivist view --

What do others on the list think?
