<a name="0500qlink1">It is not that simple.  If you can't take care of yourself, society (government,
private organizations, your family) will take care</a> of you.  And instead of
facing the consequences of your decision, you will become a burden to society.

around us are starving.</a>

<a name="0500qlink3">Hence, society will try to pressure you into getting educated no matter what.</a>
<a name="0500qlink4">It may well be your education is nobody else's business, but society does have a
vested interest in making sure that you are capable of taking care of yourself
and making a positive contribution to society.</a>

<a name="0500qlink5">I think it is 'wrong headed' the way society tries to pressure people into
getting more years of 'education', instead of encouraging learning of all
types.  But society looks after its own self interest, and attempting to make
society not do that because of 'principals' is like arguing with a hungry lion.
You can't win.
