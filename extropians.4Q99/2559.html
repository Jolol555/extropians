As I tried to explain in several recent posts under this subject line,
I think knowing the consequences fully enough tells you everything worth
knowing about what law or anything "ought" to be.

<p>
An ethicial/moral rule/system is not interesting unless some creatures
(or creature parts) feel inclined to some degree to at some level want
them followed.  But if some creatures are so inclined, it is enough to
know what choices they (or their parts) are or would be inclined to want
or approve of (and at what level).  And which creatures approve of a
choice is part of the consequences of that choice.

<p>
Thus knowing the approval/wanting consequences of a choice, such as a
choice of law, tells you everything worth knowing about what that
choice "ought" to be.
