As a Canadian, I thought I'd better set the record straight:

<p>
<a name="3109qlink1">Last time I checked, Canada had a little under 28 milion</a> people, around
10% of America's population.

<p>
As another illustration, I used to live on a island, which is around 30%
larger than the country of Israel, and I think the population of Israel
is around 6 million.  If you look at this island(Vancouver Island) on a
globe, it is a tiny dot, and *dwarfed* by Canada as a whole, yet by
Israel's standard it could house over a fifth of our population.

<p>
<a name="3050qlink1">However, there is a counter point to this which is that most of Canada
is tundra and ice, not a great place to live, and impossible to farm.  I
<a name="3038qlink1">think the main argument for overpopulation is that there is not enough
room to grow all the food, not that there is not enough room to house
all the people.</a>
<br>
<a name="3050qlink2">Until we can grow meat and vegies in labs, stacked on top of one another
into huge food-producing high-rises, I still see this as a valid point,</a>
*if* we actually make it into the 100's of billions of people, which I
doubt we will.</a>

<p>
<a name="3109qlink2">Canada's birth replacement rate per couple is around 1.2, and even with
immigration it's still around 1.8, not enough to even sustain the
current population!</a>
