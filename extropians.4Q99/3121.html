<p>
I'm very excited about this Life Extension Technologies conference Alcor
Foundation is putting on in 2000.  Speakers are listed below.


<UL>
  <li>  Fourth Alcor Conference on Life Extension Technologies **


</UL>
<p>

<p>
	June 17-18, 2000:  Mark Your Calendars Today!

<p>
The world is changing rapidly.  Only a few years ago, most 
people considered  mammalian cloning to be no more than 
science fiction.   Repeated successes in this area,  however, 
have made it a reality today.  More importantly, medical 
technologies like cloning and the use of embryonic stem cells 
to regenerate tissues, promise to make it possible to reverse all 
the major degenerative diseases within our own lifetimes.  
Even aging itself is under very heavy attack by today’s 
biological and medical technologies.  

<p>
The Fourth Alcor Conference on Life Extension 
Technologies is a meeting of scientists, technologists and 
individuals who are working in fields leading toward the 
expansion of human health and longevity.

SPEAKERS AND ABSTRACTS

<pre>
	Glenna Burmer, MD, PhD
	Title:  Identifying Aging Genes by Using DNA Microarrays
</pre>
DNA Microarrays or "gene chips" are one of the most powerful methods in 
biotechnology for simultaneously analyzing the expression of thousands of 
human genes in human diseases. LifeSpan is building a database of gene 
expression in human aging and the diseases of aging using microarrays and 
methods of high throughput localization to find candidates that may be the 
drug targets for the treatment of aging diseases. Data will be presented on 
genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in aging, those that are drug 
targets or potential diagnostic markers, and those for which a function is
not yet known, but are clearly aging-associated. The high throughput nature
of 
<br>
this type of technology is changing the way discoveries are being made in 
both the field of aging as well as medicine in general.

<pre>
	Fred Chamberlain, BBE
	Title: Bioimpedance
</pre>
<br>
Bioimpedance, a biological electrical characteristic where tissues with
intact cell membranes behave very differently from tissues that have
undergone 
<br>
cell membrane breakdown, is sustained for extended periods after cessation 
of heartbeat and breathing.  Automated means of comparatively evaluating 
cryostasis protocols, as well as means for monitoring and comparing specific 
cryotransport operations, will be reported in the context of early 
experimentation and (if circumstances have permitted) actual cryotransports.

<pre>
	Eric K. Drexler, PhD
	Title:  The Conservative Treatment of Transient Inviability 
		or Your computer crashed -- shall I throw it out?
</pre>
Emerging nanotechnologies will lead to cellular-scale robotic surgical 
devices able to sense and repair tissues with molecular precision. Those of 
us who stay intact until this technology arrives could achieve and keep good 
health indefinitely. Traditional medicine discards patients if their vital
processes re interrupted for more than a few minutes. In light of the
prospects for future repair, this treatment - physical destruction of
potentially healthy human beings -- seems 
regrettable. Physicians wishing to save lives 
should instead recommend treatments that keep patients intact for restoration 
using the next generation of medical technologies.

<pre>
	Gregory M. Fahy, PhD
	Title: Cryobiological Research at 21st Century Medicine
</pre>
21st Century Medicine is probing a broad range of problems in cryobiology. 
A central aspect is our attempt to demonstrate successful cryopreservation of 
mammalian organs, particularly the kidney. Construction of perfusion 
equipment, new surgical approaches, our new surgical staff, and initial 
results of perfusion with novel, low-toxicity vitrification solutions will be 
described.

<pre>
	James J. Hughes, PhD 
	Title:  Our Evolving Definitions of Death: Looking Ahead
</pre>
The definition of death varies cross-culturally. "Death" has also changed 
radically in the West in the last thirty years. The shift from circulation
and respiration-based definitions of death to "whole brain death" has left us
in an unstable compromise. Just as mechanical heart-lung aids forced us from 
body to brain, advances in remediation of brain injuries will force us to 
grapple with questions about the integrity and continuity of personhood. 
Cryonics will be a part of a group of therapeutic modalities that will
force a new personal identity-based concept of rights. The question may
shift from 
<br>
"Live or dead?" to "What can we do with/who controls various kinds of 
bodies, with various degrees of consent or prior expressed will on the part
of the occupant?" I will discuss some political and legal scenarios. One 
possible outcome might be that the re-animated cryonaut would be a legally 
and phenomenologically different person than the person who was frozen.

<pre>
	Ralph Merkle, PhD
	Title:   Nanomedicine and Cryostasis
</pre>
<br>
Human beings are made from molecules, and how those molecules are 
arranged makes the difference between good health and bad, between youth 
and old age, and between life and death. Most medical problems involve 
damage at the molecular and cellular level. Today's medical tools are very 
limited in their ability to deal with such damage. In the future, with 
nanotechnology, we should be able to arrange and rearrange molecular 
structures in most of the ways permitted by physical law. The medical 
applications of such an ability will be remarkable. We should be able to heal 
and cure under conditions that today would be considered completely 
hopeless. We should even be able to reverse freezing injury, giving us the 
ability to restore to health people who have been frozen using today's 
methods.

<pre>
	Richard Morales, MD
	Title: Setting Your Internal Clock
</pre>
<br>
Circadian rhythms are well known scientific phenomenon.  Recently, we 
have learned how to reset our internal clocks with diet, exercise, sleep and 
hormonal manipulation.  Dr. Morales will discuss some of the breakthroughs 
in this area and their application to anti-aging medicine.

<pre>
	Richard Morales, MD
	Title: Fear of Death Intereferes with Rational Processes
</pre>
In this brief presentation we will try to lay the foundation for 
understanding how the 'fear of death' arises and how it interferes 
with an individuals rational process, especially in relation to  
acting to preserve, extend and possibly, via cryonic suspension, 
return to, life. We will draw on the work of Stanislaw Groff MD and 
my own personal experience from 30 years of working with depressed 
and anxious patients in a private practice of psychiatry. Due to the 
brevity of the session, audience participation will be held during 
the lunch break. We will also review current research on the effects 
of stress on early brain development.  

<pre>
	Tomas A. Prolla, PhD
	Title: Gene Expression Profile of the Aging Process 
</pre>
The gene expression profile of the aging process was analyzed in skeletal 
muscle of mice. Use of high-density oligonucleotide arrays representing 6347 
genes revealed that aging resulted in a differential gene expression pattern 
indicative of a marked stress response and lower expression of metabolic and 
biosynthetic genes. Most alterations were either completely or partially 
prevented by caloric restriction, the only intervention known to retard aging 
in mammals. Transcriptional patterns of calorie-restricted animals suggest 
that caloric restriction retards the aging process by causing a metabolic
shift toward increased protein turnover and decreased macromolecular damage. 
Gene expression profiling of the aging process provides a new tool to test 
aging interventions.

<p>
	Robert Newport, MD (details pending)
	
<pre>
	Gregory Stock, PhD
	Title:  Who's afraid of freezer burn?
</pre>
<br>
Long before biological reconstruction of a frozen body (or brain) could be 
feasible, technology would have to advance sufficiently for uploading to 
occur.  Moreover, the technological developments needed even for 
uploading are sufficiently powerful to dramatically transform the world in a 
way that would make biology a far less interesting substrate for life than 
silicon and its progeny. The incentives for a biological rather than a 
technological awakening from a cryonic state are unlikely ever to exist, so 
cryonists -- if they are someday revived -- are almost certainly bidding
adieu to corporeal existence.

<pre>
	Natasha Vita-More   
	(An after dinner presentation by Natasha Vita-More on her current book
</pre>
project followed by a panel discussion. )
_A Talent for Living: Cracking the Myths of Mortality._  Many have written
about
<br>
the technologies of extending life but not why we would want to live longer. 
There is an art to living - how we maintain our well being and how we bring 
aesthetics into our lives.  We can approach life merely as a series of events 
or as a creative and challenging exploration. The panel will examine the 
cultural myths preventing mainstream acceptance of extreme life extension 
and discuss how to crack them. 

<pre>
	Michael West, PhD
	Title: Human Therapeutic Cloning
</pre>
<br>
Many technologies have been developed and refined in the past few years 
that set the stage for human therapeutic cloning as a potentially limitless 
source of cells for tissue engineering and transplantation medicine. These 
technologies include the identification and isolation of pluripotent stem
cells that are capable of generating all of the cell types in the body,
genetic and 
<br>
cell engineering techniques enabling the designee of custom 
tissues and organs, and advanced in somatic cell nuclear transfer to clone 
ungulates confluence of these technologies will lead to means for developing 
tissue therapies that will overcome the present difficulties related to
immune compatibility and graft rejection, and thus the requirements for use
of 
<br>
immunosuppressive drugs and/or mmunomodulatory protocols.

<pre>
	Brian Wowk, PhD 
	Title: Molecular Control of Ice Formation
</pre>
Antifreeze proteins and ice nucleating proteins found in nature are able to 
respectively prevent or catalyze the formation of ice while present in very 
small quantities. It has recently been demonstrated that synthetic molecules 
are able to perform similar functions. The availability of inexpensive 
synthetic molecules for blocking ice formation opens new frontiers for 
control of ice in industry and agriculture, and for eliminating ice in 
cryopreservation applications.
