Hello,

I mean not to be facetious either, although it was flippant.  This quote
sparked reply:

<p>
<i>&gt;"Once a kid</i><br>
<a href="1982.html#1983qlink2">&gt; starts learning, his actions may be shaped by memetic inheritance,</a><br>

The brain has always fascinated me.  As medicine developed over the years,
common knowledge went from the heart as center of being to the brain of center
of consciousness, although probably many a wise elder or shaman would have
known correctly.

<p>
The brain is a physical structure (here I venture into unfamiliar territory)
where sophisticated chemical and electromagnetic reactions take place to fire
the mechanisms of consciousness, memory, and locomotion.  The question of
self-awareness or spirit is not one I can answer, although many venture to do
so, with their reasons.

<p>
Here are some links about brain, they are mostly clinical.

I'm sure there are many more.  I can not name many brain structures besides the
cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and brain stem.

<p>
Ah, the brain, perhaps the most complicated result of a fertilized zygote.
Here's to brain.

<p>
Anyways, I commented on a statement that we are limited or bound by our genetic
makeup, which I feel is not accurate, although I do not dispute genetic
predisposition.
