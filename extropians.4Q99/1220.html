First I would question why someone might sit down with a compass and

<a name="1231qlink3">that is in sync with their own enjoy it and implement it into their lives,
but this doesn't make them blinded to their own lives. A person who
inhibits or restrains his creativity is usually because of his own
emotional ups and downs, financial woos, or a creative block.</a>

<a href="1214.html#1220qlink2">&gt;Well, the artists who are Objectivists might beg to differ.  I mean they</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1231qlink4">Some Romantic Realistic are not objectivists but paint romantically

knowledgeable enough to comment fully.</a> Romantic Realism was not mentioned
<a name="1231qlink5">in any of my art history curriculum in undergrad or grad schools.  I don't
seem to have reference to it in my library of art books.  I did view some
pieces on the Internet and I thought they were fine art, but I didn't see
any net.art or other electronic art (videos or robotics).</a>

<p>
<a name="1231qlink6">Romanticism was an established art genre long before Rand's time.</a>  In that
<a name="1231qlink7">Rand did not appreciate modern art or abstract expressionism, she held
<a name="1231qlink8">Romanticism up as pretty much the only worthwhile art form.</a>  It was safe.
(Romanticism was an "art and  intellectual movement originating in Europe
in the late 18th century and characterized by a heightened interest in
nature, emphasis on the individual's expression of emotion and imagination,
</a>
<a name="1231qlink9">departure from the attitudes and forms of classicism,</a> and rebellion against
<a name="1231qlink10">established social rules and conventions.")</a>


<p>

<a name="1231qlink12"><i>&gt;Objectivist artists.  Some are good, though most are bad.  </i><br>

<p>
I hope we have the scrutiny recognize what doesn't work and the aesthetics
to cherish what does work.</a>
