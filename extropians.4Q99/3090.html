I guess you're right.  I had in the earlier debate suggested crossbreeding
humans and apes.

<p>
<a href="3069.html#3090qlink2">&gt; For example, let's say I want to develop some form</a><br>

<p>
I'm talking about just plain old uplifting.  It's another matter whether
language ability is necessary for intelligence or sentience.  I imagine for
the latter it might be though for the former I'm not sure.

<p>
<a name="3102qlink1">Octopodes already do have pretty elaborate means of communicating</a> which are
visually based.  The form of communication they have, however, seems to be
one of communicating inner (emotional?) states -- not symbolic like human
speech, writing, and art.

<p>
<a name="3102qlink2">As for me, surely it would be nice to have an uplifted octopus able</a> to speak
in English, but I think that sort of project would take too long.  I think
before we got to that point in the project, we'd had some form of sentience,
then it would be up to individual members the uplifted species to decide
whether they wished to have that ability.  (I still assume before uplift
choice does not exist.:)

Cheers!
