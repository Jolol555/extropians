I got the same question from a girlfriend at one point too --

<p>
I answered:

<OL>
  <li>  When you are frozen, the soul stays with your body, presumably because
     the structure hasn't decayed.
  <li>  When you are frozen, the soul departs forever.  Implying that when
     reanimated you are soulless.
  <li>  When you die, the soul departs and when reanimated the soul returns
     to occupy your body.
  <li>  When you die, the soul departs, going whereever souls go and when
     reanimated the next available or nearest "free" soul occupies your body.

For the non-computer people this is a kind of [11, 00, 01, 10] logical set,
i.e. all the possibilities.

<p>
If they have a personal self interest, they will probably choose (a)
or (c).  If they are "real" believers, they will probably be going through
the Bible for years trying to figure out which case "fits" best.  This
explanation does away with having to stamp out the concept of "soul"
(which in our society is probably a damn hard thing to do), and simply
lets them choose the possibility that best fits their strange perspective
of reality.
