They are made up of people, and as entities do not take any action that
is not action decided on by individual people. "Government" and "media"
are merely smokescreens to allow individuals to get away with actions
that they could not effect if they acted as private individuals. It is
the best refuge for the sociopath to lead a productive life. As Dogbert
said, in describing jury duty,"what other job allows you to decide the
fate of other people's lives?"
