The debate on which should come first, AI or Nanotechnology, is fun but
of academic interest only, it won't change things in any way. Not that I'm
criticizing anyone, I've been known to debate issues that have not the
slightest practical significance too. But the fact of the matter is if you wish
AI to happen first then work on it, if you want Nanotechnology to happen
first then help develop that technology. Nothing else matters.

<a name="2732qlink1">Maybe I'm crazy but I think both are our friend even though there is a very
good chance either will end up killing us dead as a door nail. The reason I say
this is because there is also a probability greater than zero that they will not.</a>
That gives me a little hope, not a lot but a little, without them I'm dead meat for sure.
If I'm given a choice between little chance and no chance it won't take me long
to make my decision.
