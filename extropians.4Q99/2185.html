for multiple sovereign powers to coexist on a single planet, because they
will tend to find themselves forced into an exponential arms race that
converts the entire mass of the planet into industry and weaponry.</a>  The fact

weapons makes the problem even worse.</a>

<p>
Spreading into space, and especially interstellar space, makes the problem a
bit more manageable.  Defense becomes easier, the cost of exploiting
resources rises, and in general the potential for a secret military buildup
becomes much less destabilizing.  That could give you a situation where
peace has a reasonable chance of prevailing.
