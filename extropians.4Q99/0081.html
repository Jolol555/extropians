<a href="0047.html#0081qlink1"> &gt; And like Robert Moore I am confused as to which organization at this point </a><br>

<p>
In case you haven't heard: right now only CI and Alcor are in
business. CI's protocol, frankly, is a joke. So the choice is quite
clear...

<a href="0047.html#0081qlink2"> &gt; to anyone here who is looking for guidance regarding cryonics.  At present I </a><br>

<p>
The situation has changed, in a way it hasn't changed at all.

<p>
<a href="0047.html#0081qlink3"> &gt; I simply want to go with the organization that offers the most advanced form </a><br>

<p>
Right now your choice seems to be easy: Arizona. Hint: it's quake
country, too.

<a href="0047.html#0081qlink4"> &gt; I think Mike Darwin is what I would call a "realisic cynic".  He has been in </a><br>

The problem is not just scientific/technological: it's mostly
political. I don't know how you feel, but I intend to find out how bad
the technical part of the problem is. If it's soluble, excellent, if
it's insoluble, the more need to hurry on CR/nano/gerontology research.

You know, according to some people there is no such thing as
information destruction. The proof? Because *you* can't *prove* there
is information destruction. Excuse me, Mr. Topsy-Turvy? Who's is
supposed to bear the burden of proof here?
 
<p>
<a href="0047.html#0081qlink6"> &gt; I would ask for feedback from those of you who read all least some of these </a><br>

<p>
He's brutal, and that doesn't make him many friends. However, the
factual nitty-gritty part of what he says is imo very real.

<p>
<a href="0047.html#0081qlink7"> &gt; current state of cryonics?  Is there hope for reversible suspension even </a><br>

Hear, hear!
