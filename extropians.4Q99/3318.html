<a name="3334qlink1">I found your post very powerful and unnerving to say the least.  I had 
already read about England's surveillance cameras but had no idea on what 
scale it is to be deployed.

<p>
The point about how "good middle-class folks" are preoccupied with just 
trying to make a living and care for their families is so important.  They 
can be taken in by politicians and other government officials who in the 
name of "safety and security" will subvert our civil liberties to an extent 
never before seen if allowed.  But will the public awaken in time?</a>

<p>
<a name="3334qlink2">I tried explaining this to a very right-wing friend of mine who kept on 
saying, "if you have done nothing wrong and are a good citizen then you have 
nothing to fear from the government."  He just would not recognize how this 
is such a slippery slope.</a>

<p>
<a name="3356qlink1"><a name="3334qlink3">I agree with you that most likely the most terrible totalitarian governments 
have yet to be.  As an American citizen my deepest hope is that my own 
nation will not fall prey to this.</a>

<p>
<a name="3334qlink4">Also a U.S. president could declare martial law in a time of severe crisis, 
thereby suspending the constitution and becoming a dictator over the 
military.  In a time of fear and violence(repeated terrorist strikes or an 
epidemic) things could really get out of control but I would hope the checks 
and balances of the other branches of government and public opinion would 
take hold.   A common scenario is shown in the film "The Siege" but I see a 
much more likely and less explosive and incremental loss of American 
liberties done for "our own good."</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3356qlink2">It looks like parts of Europe may be heading down this road now.  What do 
the Europeans on this list have to say??  Or do you feel what the English 
are doing is not so threatening?</a>

<p>
<a name="3334qlink5">Again, I found your post very thought-provoking and thank you for it. I find 
it ironic that the extropians might find themselves in future 
decades(especially after cryonic reanimation) in a world where governments 
feel the need to know everything(and they basically could) and you have 
"rights" as long as you behave yourself.</a>  I look forward to reading the 
responses to your post.


<p>
best regards,

<p>
