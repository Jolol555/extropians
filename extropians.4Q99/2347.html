&gt;&gt; [Axelrod] discovered
&gt;&gt; that the best way to do that is often to play nice; that does
&gt;&gt; nothing to support whether "playing nice" is or isn't a worthy
&gt;&gt; goal in its own right.
</pre>
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2341.html#2347qlink1">&gt; The worthiness of "playing nice" relates to how it effectively promotes</a><br>
<i>&gt; any population that practices it. From an evolutionary standpoint,</i><br>
<i>&gt; populations that play nice succeed (reproduce and thrive) more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; populations that do not play nice.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2371qlink1">You're making the further unstated assumption that the success of a
population is good; i.e., you are defining moral worth as equivalent
to success of the species.</a>  That's as good a desire as any, but there's
<a name="2371qlink2">certainly nothing more fundamentally "right" about success than any
other human desire.</a>  There _is_ something unique about one goal that
might make it a good premise on which to base ethical arguments: the
continued existence of the ethical actor.  Individual survival (of the
entity exercising moral choice--whatever its physical form) is unique
in that it is the only goal that is a necessary condition of all other
possible goals.  Taking it as a premise can lead to some useful
conclusions, but alas, I don't think it is fruitful enough to produce
ethical systems as complete as we want.  Species survival might well
be a richer source of ethical premises, but I'm not yet convinced that
there's real value in it.
