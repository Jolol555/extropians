<p>
When I am in a room, and the ligth goes out I still know how the room is
laid out, I can still manouver around in the room. I can walk somewhere and
pick up something.

<p>
<a name="2646qlink1">I have a model of the room in my mind.</a>

<p>
I then use my senses to continuously update the model of the world which I
hold in my mind. When I cannot see I listen or feel, and get a somewhat less
complete model in my mind than I do with vision. But the model is still
there.

<p>
I suspect that bats uses their sonar for similar purpose. They have a bad
eyesight but good hearing. Their model of the world could be just as good as
mine. In some cases it is no doubt better, as i can practically never hit a
fly in the air which they do all the time for food.

<p>
Furthermore I can imagine what will happen if I walk thru the room and then
stumble over the table. Therefore I am able to choose a different path thru
the room.

<p>
I can simulate/make a scenario in my mind. Playing it out in my minds model.
Therefore I can think and plan ahead.

<p>
I suspect that the the idea of having a consantly updated model of the world
in my mind is a significant idea when it comes to AI.

<p>
When I cross that idea with the fact that I have a hard time beating the
bots in Quake 3 who are running around in a model of a world, and the fact
that it is allready possible to build 3D objects from 2 cameras to model a
3D world. Then I could imagine that if it would be somehow possible to get
real robots to move around in the real world combining these three
abilities.

<p>
A modeler for input and world building, and a simulator trying out different
moves in the model before doing them in the real world.

<p>
<a name="2650qlink1">But knowing me and all my other great ideas somebody brighter has probably
gotten the idea sometimes in the sixties.</a>

<p>
Does anybody know about research material among these lines?

<p>
Regards
