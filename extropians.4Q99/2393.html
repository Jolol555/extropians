In Jupiter's atmosphere, the spectrometer detected surprisingly high
concentrations of argon, krypton and xenon, [...]

<p>
       The discovery of these gases in such high quantities at Jupiter raises
questions about how they got there. "In order to catch these gases, Jupiter
had
<br>
to trap them physically by condensation or freezing," Owen said. This
process, he
<br>
said, requires extremely cold temperatures of about -240 degrees Celsius (-400
degrees Fahrenheit), colder than the surface of Pluto, the planet farthest
from the
<br>
Sun. Planetesimals (small objects orbiting the Sun) in the Kuiper Belt beyond
Pluto would be this cold, but Jupiter is more than six times closer to the
Sun and
<br>
thus is much warmer. For this reason, Jupiter could not have been the site
where
<br>
the three noble gases were originally trapped. 

<p>
       "This raises some intriguing possibilities," Owen said. "One<br>
explanation
<br>
suggests that Jupiter was formed out in the area around the Kuiper Belt and
was
<br>
dragged inward to its present location. Another possibility is that the solar
nebula, a huge cloud of gas and dust from which our solar system formed, was
much colder than scientists believe. A third hypothesis proposes that the
solid
<br>
materials that brought these noble gases to Jupiter began forming in the
original
<br>
huge, interstellar cloud of gas and dust even before it collapsed to form
the solar
<br>
nebula. That would make these icy materials older and more primitive than we
had expected." 

<p>
       "If either of the last two hypotheses turns out to be correct, it<br>
would suggest
<br>
that giant planets can form closer to their stars than current theories
predict,"
<br>
Owen said. "This could help explain the new observations of planetary systems
around other stars, in which such close-in giant planets are relatively
common."
