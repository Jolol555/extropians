To which Damien Broderick replied,

In the summer of 1998, when I started putting my nanotech notes
together into a web site, I discussed the project with Chris
Peterson.  She said it would be a perfect occasion to use
CritSuite.  (That was before she knew what I was going to say.)  I
agreed.  I *wanted* people to use CritSuite.  If you look on the
Table of Contents page of Geniebusters, you will find links to
CritSuite.  However, when I saw the level of the discussion, I
quickly lost interest.  I haven't looked at the CritSuite comments
for several months.  Maybe some of the newer comments are better.
I doubt it.

<p>
In one of the letters that he sends to Senior Associates, Eric
Drexler mentioned that Will Ware and J Storrs Hall had used
CritSuite to comment on Geniebusters -- as if they had said all
that needed to be said.  As far as I know, that has been Eric's
only response to Geniebusters.  (I can't quote him exactly, since I
don't have the letter handy -- it's in a store room.)

<p>
Incidentally, Extropians might find something else of interest on
the Table of Contents page.  Look at the bottom of the page.
