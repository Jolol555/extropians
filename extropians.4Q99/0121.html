<a name="0174qlink1"><a href="0047.html#0121qlink1">&gt;  &gt; What do think of the current state of cryonics?  Is there hope for reversible suspension even within twenty years? </a><br>

<p>
Brian Wowk, physicist at 21CM, went on the record with the prediction
that reversible cryo-suspension of a brain would be accomplished in ten
years.  He said that on one of the videotapes that 21CM released
detailing their research and business plan. 

<p>
Good to know that some of the older folks on this list will have
something to fall back on :)
