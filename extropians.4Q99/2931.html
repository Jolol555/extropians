married, or even that you would marry (especially for women) is modern, and by
no means universal.  When parents pick partners for their children in arranged
marriages do you think they check sexual orientation first?  When they find out,
are the children off the hook to produce grandchildren? NO.

Plenty of gay people do not realize, or do not accept, that they are gay until
after they have had families.  This was especially true in the past when many
people did not even know homosexuality existed, and many gays thought they were
all alone with a condition that no one else had, and that they had to hide.

Show some compassion, drop this thread.
