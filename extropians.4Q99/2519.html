<p>
<a name="2556qlink1">It seems that you assume that:

<p>
    Virtually all advanced creatures in the universe care essentially
    only about their *individual* longevity.

<p>
And though you have not said so explicitly, you seem to have "fast
high-communication computation" concept of the individual.  That is,
you seem to preclude a creature who's concept of itself includes
things, like computers around distant stars, that can't contribute
to computations which must be done within a short time and require
high levels of communication between parts.  After all, a creature
focused on the longevity of its clan or species might act very
differently.</a>

<p>
<a name="2556qlink2">You seem to want to allow these creatures to place a small value on
things like art, but if you allow that, I can't see why you don't also
allow them to place a small value on colonization, and then we have
to explain the lack of colonization again.  Similarly, you have to
assume that virtually all creatures have this singular focus on
"individual" longevity, to explain the lack of colonization.</a>

<p>
<a name="2556qlink3">I accept that the ultimate test of your assumption is empirical,
and so we should consider whatever empirical evidence you offer.</a>
<a name="2556qlink4">But if you think there are theoretical reasons for us to think
your assumption plausible, you need to clarify them.  All
creatures valuing only longevity is not implied by these
creatures being conscious, nor is it implied by an evolutionary
selection of creatures.</a>

<p>
<a name="2556qlink5">The only plausible scenario I can imagine for producing this
situation is if a single power arises early in the universe and
quickly fills the universe without actually colonizing it much,
and actively destroys any creatures with other values.</a>
