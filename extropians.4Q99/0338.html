Abstract
<br>
  Administration of beta-carotene in
<br>
  beadlets to baboons potentiates alcohol-induced liver
  injury. To determine whether this also occurs in other species, and whether
  the beadlet carrier itself contributes to the toxicity, rats were given for 2
  mo vitamin A (1.4 U/J), beta-carotene (4.8,
  12.0, and 24.0 U/J, with or without beadlets), or
  corresponding amounts of beadlets without
  beta-carotene, in diets containing either
  carbohydrates or equivalent amounts of ethanol. Isoenergetic substitution of
  ethanol (36% of total energy) for carbohydrates reduced hepatic vitamin A by
  80%, and such a depletion was also observed with
  beta-carotene as vitamin A precursor. By
  contrast, ethanol raised hepatic
<br>
  beta-carotene, which was further increased
  by beadlets. Thus, whereas alcohol promoted hepatic
  depletion of vitamin A, it had the opposite effect on
  beta-carotene. Ethanol seems to affect the
  homeostasis of beta-carotene. Furthermore,
  the ethanol-induced oxidative stress, assessed by an increase in hepatic
  4-hydroxynonenal and F2-isoprostanes (measured by gas chromatography-mass
  spectrometry), was not improved despite a concomitant rise in hepatic
  antioxidants (beta-carotene and vitamin E).
  Moreover, beadlets resulted in proliferation of the smooth
  endoplasmic reticulum and in leakage of the mitochondrial glutamate
  dehydrogenase into the plasma, reflecting mitochondrial injury (both
  documented by electron microscopy). Thus, in rats given ethanol,
  beta-carotene is not an efficient vitamin A
  precursor. Its bioavailability was improved by beadlets, but
  the ethanol-induced oxidative stress was not attenuated and there was
  associated hepatotoxicity that now needs to be assessed in humans.
