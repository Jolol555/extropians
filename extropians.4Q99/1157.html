There are many reasons to object to this law.  My own core objection is
that it is effectively punishing people for their thoughts, rather than
their actions.  (Thou shalt not have erotic thoughts about children.)

<p>
I would like to see a sharp change in our judicial system away from 
differentiating offenses on the basis of intent or premeditation.  If I murder 
you, why does it matter whether I planned it ahead of time?  Are you any more 
or less dead?

<p>
Similarly, I object to laws against drunk driving.  The offense should be
"impaired driving" or "reckless endangerment".  If I hit you with my car, you 
are just as injured whether I am impaired because I was drinking, I'm stoned, 
I have a bad cold, or I just broke up with my girlfriend.

<p>
And why is conspiracy a crime?  Why is "conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor"
a felony?
