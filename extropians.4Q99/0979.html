I can't reveal much about why I believe him but I've been studying similar 
people for the past four years.  I have a screening method, which I can't 
reveal, just as a magician can't reveal how his tricks are done and some 
local restaurants can't reveal ingredients in their special dishes.  I can 
tell you I believe him because he fits into a profile of such a person. I 
can't tell you all of the overrepresentations because it may reveal some of 
my screening method, but some  include: social/emotional trouble with father, 
genius-type or highly intellectual,  and Jewish or Asian descent.  Am I 
saying that a higher proportion of Jewish and Asian people have had less or 
none in the way of sexual attractions and feelings?  My answer -  I haven't 
seen that it's overwhelmingly apparent but there is a noticeable 
overrepresentation with these groups of people.  There is one other reason 
I'm convinced there are males who have far less than the average nonplatonic 
reactions - things they do that I perceive "between the lines".  

<p>
Even if by some chance the particular male I've mentioned has somehow "lied" 
I'm very interested in this topic especially because I'm interested in 
debunking myths and popular opinions which are accepted as facts.  This one 
is as big as the myth of "normal males think about sex every so many 
minutes".   The interval of time is way too short to being even close to 
possible for the majority of people.   Even with all of my nonplatonic males 
aside, I have no proof that males think about sex (or females in even a 
nonplatonic sense)  within any particular time period.  I'm sure there is an 
average time period, but I doubt if it's the so many seconds or few minutes 
we keep hearing about.  Give me a break!

<p>
Btw, the male I've told you about has done nothing to inhibit his feelings 
<br>
(inhibit in this context meaning deliberate to any extent). He does want to <br>
experience something nonplatonic as soon as possible.  It seems to be 
bothering him enormously and if it doesn't jeopardize his happiness or mental 
health now, I expect it will soon unless he gets relief somehow.
