I sense the beginning of a "You were lucky, we lived in a cardboard
box in the middle of the highway..."-thread</a> :-)

My father was very interested in geography, or rather maps. He made a
point of putting up maps on the walls of the kitchen (one of the
world, one of Europe - he switched place of them every other year to
make sure my brother and I got equal education), my room (mainly a map
of Mars and the solar system) and even in the bathrooms (later on,
they was replaced by an evolutionary tree in one of them and the
evolution of the arameic alphabet in the other). One of the better
ideas for education I have encountered.

<a name="1162qlink2">I think the best way of stimulating children to learn is to give them
easy access to stuff they can learn from. Hence, leave the atlases and
encyclopedias lying around.</a>
