<a name="1336qlink1">The guy from the JPL who viewed my Bioastronomy paper said the requirement
for a CC was under question.</a>  I'm clearly on the fence since I've seen
no evidence that the astronomers are factoring in any possibility for
interstellar mining actvities by SIs.<a name="1336qlink2">  I believe the assumption is that
Supernovas have the same brightness at all ages and that is very
iffy IMO unless you can prove that the composition of the SNs is
the same.  Distant/Old SNs occur in an "unintelligent"/"virginal" universe,
Recent/Near SNs occur (potentially) in an "intelligent"/"engineered"</a>
universe.

<p>
Unless someone shows me spectroscopic data on the SNs that show they
all have the same composition, I'm a cosmological constant doubter.

<a name="1336qlink3">So, what's the problem?  In 50 years we send out 200 billion AI
nanoships to each galaxy at .99c.  They reach all of the galaxies
(in something around 18-20 billion light years), astroengineer them into
Kardashev Type III galaxy-ships (take a billion years, we've got
plenty of time), compute how much energy &amp; matter must be expended
to turn the ships around and get them back to the origin by
CurrentEra+149 billion years.   The matter and energy expended
in the process is lost to the expanding universe (operating costs,
what can you do?), but most of the matter and energy of any use gets
returned to the starting point (presumably at sub-black-hole densities).

<p>
<a name="1336qlink4">So now you have most of the M&amp;E in the universe in one place.
Construct a single-crystaline ultra-SI and spend the rest of the
time (&gt; 10^89 years until all the matter evaporates) throwing
information bottles into subspace or building alternate universes
and tunnels into them.

<p>
One thing is for sure the SCUSI (best voiced with an Italian accent),
is going to have lots more resources at its disposal than we are
to figure this out solutions for this problem.

<p>
<a name="1336qlink5">Whenever we read papers regarding current perspectives on physics
and astronomy, it is almost always done from the Occams Razor
bias that "intelligence" is hard and rare.  Flip the position!!!
What if "intelligence" is easy and common?  What if the universe
is populated/dominated by entitites at the end points of the
evolution of an Extropian philosophy?  What if the **simplest**
explanation for what we observe *has* to incorporate the evolution
of intelligence to the allowable limits?</a>

<p>
Are SIs going to worry about colonizing galaxies?  Hell no.  They are
"immortal" within the limits of their environment.  They see the
universe "ship" as a f****** Titanic.  They are going to devote
every last ounce/erg of their M&amp;E to getting off of that ship.

<p>
<a name="1336qlink6">We shouldn't be studying negative energy, we should be looking
for disappearing mass.   We should be trying to figure out ways
of standing on the shoulders of those who have had a lot more time
to think about these problems than we have had.</a>

<p>
<a name="1336qlink7"><a href="1307.html#1327qlink4">&gt; Perhaps the most optimistic thing about these two papers is not their</a><br>
<i>&gt; conclusions, but the fact that physical eschatology and the effects</i><br>
