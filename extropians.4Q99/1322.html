<a name="1330qlink1">What maybe seem obvious bullshit to the freethinker, is precious and 
comforting to the pious. The problem lies in how one tells a person the bad 
news -- so they'll question it themselves. Children should *never* be told 
such lies. But when they are, it is usually by someone they love and trust. 
Even when we tell them Santa is a lie, it reflects on the very life-givers 
that brought them into this world.

Religion is like a security blanket. It is often a foundation upon which many 
<a name="1388qlink3">people build their very lives. Be gentle when you tell them it isn't there. 
And if they see</a> it!!
