I see, I'm very curious on how these damages extrapolate to humans, because I've
heard some animals, experience some regrowth of these neurons, although the growth
is chaotic and the neurons seem to reappear on places where they shouldn't be, and
some animals present no regrowth at all, do you know any source where I can
further research this? And do you think that there could be the posibility that
newer drugs or neuroprotectants could bring the positive effects of this powerful
mood altering chemicals  and minimize their results, because it seems that nature
never gives us something without taking something in return, psychedelics are
really powerful mind tools with many uses, but using them also presents the risk
of damaging our brain, I hope further research in neuroscience will lead us to an
answer.
