arms to legs tho). In fact, I've just been raped by the bitch :-(
I've also had some experiences with gay cocks. Actually,
they weren't really gay; cocks will mate with anything that
looks like a crouching (i.e."willing") chicken. I've seen them 
rape a dying cock and dead chickens, for example. They
would mate with the dead or dying animal until completely
exhausted. Just couldn't help themselves, apparently.
