No, if the extra reproduction gained early exceeds that forgone late (due to 
earlier
<br>
death), then the mutation is beneficial to the individual's reproductive 
fitness.  There 
<br>
is actually a benefit to faster generation times, since offspring born early 
start
<br>
reproducing earlier.  But what counts is the benefit to the organism's 
reproductive
<br>
fitness.  Having more offspring early *and* surviving late would be even 
better than
<br>
early offspring and early death, it's just often not possible.

&gt;  of slower reproducers?<br>

<p>
Dying early, per se, does not improve your rate of reproduction.  If an 
allele which
<br>
hastens death *also* improves net reproduction yes, it will spread through the
population.  Such things appear reasonably common in real life.  However, any 
affect on increased evolutionary rate is negligeable - it's the fast 
reproduction 
<br>
which makes the allele spread.

<p>
It could, just as mutagenesis can increase evolutionary rates in the lab.
However, if the shorter lifespan is in any meaningful way detrimental to the
fitness of individual organisms, it will be lost anyway.

<p>
Incidentally, according to many punctuated equilibrium models, most organisms
are already pretty much adapted to their environments.  Evolution then becomes
a matter of selection weeding out the continual onset of deleterious new 
mutations.  In that case a shorter generation time is no help; you're getting
more mutations from the faster reproduction.
