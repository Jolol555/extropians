Qualia,

<p>
<a name="3594qlink1"><a name="2791qlink1"><a name="2790qlink1">I wonder what will happen when I can link the output of one person's V4 area 
to all the places my V4 sends connections</a> to.  Will I then get to experience 
someone else's sensation of red?</a>  My brother is color deficient (true, it's a 
</a>
problem of sensory<a name="2790qlink2"> detection more than processing),</a> but I would be fascinated 
to know what he perceives.<a name="2790qlink3">  And what about true variations in perception, 
</a>
like synesthesia.<a name="2790qlink4">  I am forced to believe that qualia exists because I 
</a>
<a name="3594qlink2">experience<a name="2790qlink5"><a name="2791qlink2"> it.  I suspect that someday we will be able to reproduce it, and 
<a name="2791qlink3"><a name="2790qlink6">then change</a></a> it.  Once we are able to do those things, we will likely be on 
the road to understanding</a></a> it.  As for whether AI's will have qualia if we 
don't specifically design<a name="2790qlink7"> for it (say, by mimicking the structure</a> of our 
perceptural cortex), I couldn't say.  It might emerge, or it might not.  
<a name="2791qlink5"><a name="2790qlink8">Believe it or not, I still think AI's can be intelligent, self-aware, and 
deserving of rights without having qualia per se.  Qualia is a fascinating 
phenomenon, but not the yardstick by which I judge personhood.</a>  Perhaps AI's 
will experience pure abstract consciousness, with awareness but no 
</a>
perception.<a name="2790qlink9">  I'm still looking into the topic.</a>
