<a name="2072qlink1"><a href="2059.html#2060qlink1">&gt; &gt; Rebuilding a viable population wouldn't take more than a few tons</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of humans--a dozen young, healthy, diverse fertile women and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; dewar full of sperm--</a>but any small lack of foresight or setback</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that prevented them from bearing healthy fertile children would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doom the colony, and we'd need about 16 years before we'd know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lee my good fellow, why on Earth would you want to continue</i><br>
<i>&gt; propagating the alphabet soup that constitutes our genome?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you a closet luddite sent to spy on us?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Seriously, if we can take the human genome apart in less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; a generation, I don't see why we can't engineer a better one</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the same time (given the march of the underlying technologies).</i><br>
<i>&gt; [The point to this is highly questionable however, given the possibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; of nanotech and uploads, but we'll assume we want some fallback</i><br>
<i>&gt; position in case a luddite virus wipes out the uploads.]</i><br>

<p>
Even if we map every effect of every allele of every gene in the
human population, the fact is that those genes don't do anything
except _in the context of the environment in which they evolved_,
and we don't know nearly enough about what that environment must
contain for the process to be sustaining.<a name="2072qlink2">  What if there happens
to be some bacterium in the uterus that plays a vital role in fetal
development, but that can't survive in low gravity?</a>  Unlikely I'm
sure, but there are thousands of other little bits of Earth that
won't be taken with us, and while terrestrial life is robust, I
don't want to bet the farm on it.

<p>
Reproduction the old-fashioned way may be an old, inefficient and
haphazard technology; but it is a _proven_ technology.  And some
of us still enjoy it.
