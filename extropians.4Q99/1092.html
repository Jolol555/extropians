LA NINA CONDITIONS LIKELY TO PREVAIL THIS FALL AND WINTER

<p>
     A repeat of last year's mild La Nina conditions -- with a 
stormy winter in the Pacific Northwest and a dry winter in the 
southwestern United States -- will be the likely outcome of seasurface
 heights observed by NASA's TOPEX/Poseidon satellite, 
scientists say.

<p>
     TOPEX/Poseidon has detected lower than normal sea-surface 
heights in the eastern North Pacific and unusually high seasurface
 heights in the western and mid-latitude Pacific. The 
height of the sea surface over a given area is an indicator of 
ocean temperature and other factors that influence climate.

<p>
     The latest measurements, taken during a 10-day data cycle 
October 5-15, are available at <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/elnino">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/elnino</a> . 
Sea-surface height is shown relative to normal (green) and 
reveals cooler water (blue and purple) measuring about 14 
centimeters (6 inches) lower in the eastern North Pacific, from 
the Gulf of Alaska to central Alaska, and along the equator. The 
cooling trend sets the stage for another La Nina this winter. 

<p>
     A mirror image of that oceanic profile prevails in the 
western and mid-latitude Pacific Ocean, where higher than normal 
sea-surface heights (red and white) are currently about 20 
centimeters or 8 inches. Unusually warm temperatures (shown in 
red and white) have persisted and topped last year's 
temperatures, said Dr. William Patzert, an oceanographer at 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA. 
 
<p>
     "These unbalanced conditions will undoubtedly exert a very 
strong influence on climate over North America this fall and 
winter," Patzert said. "Our profile of high sea-surface heights 
and warm temperatures in the western Pacific Ocean contrasts with 
low sea-surface heights and cool conditions in the eastern and 
equatorial Pacific. Those conditions will have a powerful impact 
on the weather system delivering jet streams out of the North 
Pacific."

     Conditions are ripe for a stormy, wet winter in the Pacific 
</pre>
Northwest and a dry, relatively rainless winter in Southern 
California and the Southwest, the data show. "Clearly, these 
unusual conditions, which have persisted for 2 1/2 years, will 
not be returning to normal any time soon," Patzert said. "This 
climate imbalance is big and we're definitely going through a 
decade of wild climatic behavior. But when we look back at the 
climate record over the past century, we've seen behavior like 
this before."   

<p>
     The TOPEX/Poseidon satellite's measurements have provided 
scientists with a detailed view of the 1997-1999 El Nino/La Nina 
climate pattern by measuring the changing sea-surface height with 
unprecedented precision. 

<p>
     The U.S./French TOPEX/Poseidon mission is managed by the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of Earth Sciences, 
Washington, DC. JPL is a division of the California Institute of 
Technology, Pasadena, CA.
