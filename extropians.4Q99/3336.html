Looks like this could be easily fooled with something as simple as
those Groucho Marx glasses/nose combination.</a>  If one were to be

against universal surveillance.  Now, if it becomes illegal to wear
Groucho glasses, *then* one should worry.</a>

Perhaps this is a typical aerospace-antimissile-vs-missile mindset,
but looks to me that one could have fun using technological means
to defeat automated face recognition without making obvious one
is using it, such as inflatable jowls.  Or a skin coating that changes
color on command.  Or automatic eyebrow lifters.  Eyebrow lowerers.
Forehead wrinklers.  Lip extenders.  Nostril flarerers.  What else
could we do?  spike
