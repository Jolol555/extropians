This is so self-evident to any civilized and intelligent person that I don't
see any need to qualify my statement as "my opinion."

While I might argue a bit about this generalization of Bentham and Mill to
every human situation, what is important is that you find it necessary to
make this statement to a presumably intelligent and refined audience.

<a name="0590qlink1">May I just add that unless one is a sociopath, the affirmation of one's
moral choices by a conscience that says:  "Well done, good and faithful
servant" should suffice.</a>  And one very good way to receive this enhancement
 of self-esteem is, when<a name="0590qlink2"> appropriate, to subordinate your own needs
to the welfare of others whose lives might contain less "quiet despair",
and more faith in themselves, more hope for a better future, as a result
</a>
of your effort.<a name="0590qlink3"> Isn't this the mission of Extropians? Surely you don't believe
that "when the ship is sinking, it's every man for himself".</a>

<p>
<a name="0590qlink4">Some members may ask: "Owen, what do your remarks have to do with
extropianism?"  Well, does it matter, until you deal with the would-be
extropians in your membership who have not emotionally matured beyond
the primary narcissism of a three year old?</a>
