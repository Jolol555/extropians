Thank you Cynthia.

Though obvious, and hardly original, this idea is so excellent that it
deserves diligent repetition.

<p>
Cameras are now quite cheap, so re economics it has become eminently
practical.

<p>
Cameras up and down your street, in and around you car, around your house,
even inside your house.  Every damn place.

<p>
<a name="0054qlink1">I know. Shades of big brother.  Yeah, it's a problem.  But here's the basis
of a solution.  Appropriate access to the signals.  The signals, live and
recorded, are privately owned.  Your house and car: you own the signal.
Neighborhood cameras: the community members own the signal jointly.  Big
brother gets access to the signal only under rigorously controlled
circumstances.  (Yeah, I know.  "Dream on!" you say.  Well, a fellow can
dream, can't he?)</a>

<p>
With computer mediated distribution of the live "neighborhood" signal,
people at home in front of their tv or computer monitor could get a picture
of the on street activity.  With a smart system, every car, person, and
animal could be recognized and evaluated as familiar or unfamiliar.  A
child in the street, or a pet making a bid for freedom could be
appropriately "apprehended".  They'll be no funny business in this town.
(No vandalism, graffiti, burglary, muggings, car theft, etc.)

<p>
<a name="0425qlink1">A can of worms to be sure, but I think it has promise, IF YOU CAN CONTROL
THE SIGNAL.

<p>
Big if.

<p>
Any suggestions as to how to get a leash and choke chain on Big Brother?
he he he.</a> 


<p>
			Best, Jeff Davis
