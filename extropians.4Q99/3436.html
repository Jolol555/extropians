I probably shouldn't be saying anything regarding investments
because my comments might come back to haunt me, but...

<p>
<a name="3470qlink2">If you look at Geron long term, it has a history of ups and downs
(as do many biotech companies that have very long lead times for
productization).  That is a recipe for sell on the good news
and buy-and-hold on no news.</a>

<p>
<a name="3470qlink3">If you have an IRA, Geron is probably a good bet to buy on market
(or biotech) pullbacks, hold it and forget about it.  If</a> you
<a name="3470qlink4">want to play it, you want to be very careful about their cash
reserves and their ability to raise additional capital.  Geron
has done much better than I would have expected (given the rest
of the biotech industry) in this regard.  You also have to watch
their drug development timeline.  They may be years away from
products and this is a prescription for bored investors.  Finally
there is always the potential that if they get really close to
something big pharma might snap them up.</a>

Its a swamp.
