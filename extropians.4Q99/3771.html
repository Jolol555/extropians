This is true, if it is the kind that has gates directly wired to a fixed table.  However this
is not usually the case.  Usually there is a node in there that sends and receives the
infrastructure packets and runs the algorithms to update the tables that direct the switching
part.  It is a secondary effort to speed up the node part because it is always assumed that
routes change slowly with respect to traffic on the routes.  None the less, the processors do
get the benefit of the latest technology, and do need to keep up with the ever increasing
number of infrastructure packets per second.  As a result, there is plenty of processing power
and they are *very* well connected to each other.  I was not thinking about the subversion of
the engine of the car, but rather, the driver of the car.

For security reasons, I advocate manufactures use actual ROM for the code, or once-only
encryption to gain access to the code, in these machines.  However, for ease of upgrade
reasons, most do not, and rely on simple passwords.
