There was some discussion of a similar idea at/after Extro 3, involving
smart
<br>
name tags.  Use IRDA transceivers (standard infrared components) to
exchange a
<br>
data block.  Your web address, name, a small photo of your face as a
mnemonic.
<br>
Your public encryption key.  Some of us can't remember names all that
well.
<br>
So, as you register at a conference, the helpful person behind the
counter
<br>
optionally takes your digital photo and hands you an active name tag.

<p>
I was almost tempted to build it.  I figure an IRDA transceiver,
PIC12C508,
<br>
serial EEPROM, lithium coin cell battery, PCB, $10 each for the first
few
<br>
hundred units.
