Yes, Shiller looked at data, he looked at a mountain of it until he
found two variables that produced a straight line for a while.</a>
<a name="1311qlink2">He doesn't say why they give a better picture of reality than
thousands of other variables, he doesn't explain why a deviation
from that straight line should be a cause for worry. That's why I call it
"technical analysis".</a>

<p>
<a name="1311qlink3">I have another even more fundamental objection, it hasn't worked.
It has been nearly 4 years since the prediction, not a trivial fraction
of a human lifetime, and in that time the market has exploded upward.</a>
Someday we'll enter a down market but even if it crashed tomorrow
I wouldn't be impressed with Shiller's predictive ability. Even a stopped
clock is right twice a day.
