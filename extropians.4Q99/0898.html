<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; We have discussed on this list the gender/sex role differences society
<br>
<a href="0772.html#0898qlink1"> &gt;&gt; places on men and women so with that in mind I find the conflict and</a><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; reaction to it fascinating.  The desire of the largely male group members</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; seemed very strong in wanting to negotiate a peace for female/female</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt; conflict as compared to male/male conflict.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;That has absolutely nothing to do with it.  I don't bother with, say,</i><br>
<i> &gt;Lorrey and Dees because Dees isn't a leading transhumanist and Lorrey</i><br>
<i> &gt;isn't likely to stop arguing just because I ask politely; there's no</i><br>
<i> &gt;prospect that intervention would help, and no need.  If two of</i><br>
<i> &gt;transhumanism's top PR experts wind up refusing never to speak to each</i><br>
<i> &gt;other, that's a tragedy.  If Max More and Greg Burch somehow managed to</i><br>
<i> &gt;start fighting on a public email list, I'd wade into that too.</i><br>
<i> &gt;-- &gt;&gt;</i><br>

Gender? This is absolutely none of my business - and actually I don't care 
much for the whole affair, but I want to say something anyway.
I understand little of  what is meant by: "leading transhumanists" or "Top PR 
people" but I do know Max More and Natasha Vita More - from their web work, 
Extropy magazine,  and various movie/TV appearances, and Greg Burch posts 
regularly here, but I am not aware of the other person.

<p>
The person in question seems really interested in "putting" themself on that 
level. Not by bragging about what ever he/she has accomplished, but by saying 
they are out to get her &amp;  making a big deal over it. Obviously the people 
she thinks are attacking her are not very intersted in attacking. I haven't 
seen anything like that yet.

<p>
To this uneducated eye, it looks like the original poster is young at this 
game, and suffered from a little peer envy and a little ego "smarting" when 
being corrected by one's elders over simple mistakes re: FAQ's and figures 
(who is who seems to be not open for debate, it really is a matter of what 
you've *done* not who you *are*).
