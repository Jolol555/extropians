<p>
Yes. In many quantum field models it is hard to even get a finite
energy density in vacuum.

<p>
The Casimir effect shows the existence of some vacuum energy density
(or demonstrates a negative energy density): if you put two conducting
plates close to each other, there is an attractive force. The simplest
explanation is that virtual particles with wavelengths longer than the
gap become forbidden inside it, while they still can exist outside the
gap - hence a "pressure" difference. Hmm, I probably mangled the
physics there. Oh well...

<p>

<i>&gt; about that...</i><br>

<p>
Neither do I, but I think they run afoul of the laws of thermodynamics
when they try to extract energy from the 0-point energy.

<p>
<a name="1421qlink1">If there were differences in background energy level, even very small
ones, tremendous amounts of energy could be released by redistributing
the vacuum - this isn't observed, it ought to be very visible. The
background radiation seems to show that the matter in the early</a> big
<a name="1421qlink2">bang was not quite homogenous, but it says little about the vacuum.</a>
