<a name="2909qlink1">Just occurred to me.

<p>
It is likely that in the process of uplifting, the uplifting species</a> is bound 
<a name="2909qlink2">to pass on to the uplifted species many of its own traits.  If there</a> is more 
<a name="2909qlink3">than one way to do a thing (and there often is) then it is likely that the 
uplifter would redesign the upliftee's mental architecture (where</a> their own 
<a name="2909qlink4">wasn't sufficiently advanced) in the image of their own.</a>  The exceptions to 
<a name="2909qlink5">this would be when it is easier to use a different way then how</a> the uplifter 
<a name="2909qlink6">is constructed either due to having discovered a simpler way than what 
evolved initially or due to compatibility problems</a> with the upliftee's mental 
architecture.

<p>
<a name="2909qlink7">Looked at this way, uplifting could be considered a sort of reproduction 
between the uplifted and uplifting species.</a>
