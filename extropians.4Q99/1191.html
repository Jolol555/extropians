Very funny -:)  I guess you will find out after you read my book!

<p>

<p>
Yes.  Thus, if I am transhumanist or extropian transhumanist, then my work
as an artist would express my deepest beliefs.

<p>
A  myth to be debunked. Never head of one backfiring,</a> although some
<a name="1214qlink6">performance art has use back fires, and some paintings have been burned,
then there's Burning Man, and torch dancers.  Even if an art movement
produced an unwanted result, the process has meaning.  Sometimes what the
unexpected brings to light can be even more exciting that what had been
planned.  Artists build upon ideas. Even if an idea fizzles or turns sour,
the creative individual finds a challenge in this and moves it along into
new realms.</a>

<p>
<a name="1219qlink1"><a name="1214qlink7">'&gt;The Objectivist movement's art is a
<br>
<i>&gt;case in point.  </i><br>

<p>
It's not an art movement that I am familiar with.  Perhaps it is not a
genre that artists want to exemplify.</a></a>

<p>
Cheers!
