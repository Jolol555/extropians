Sure, you could postulate a faulty gene or two in the "face/emotion"
recognition circuits and have a person that simply cannot "read"
other people and is therefore insensitive to them.  Doesn't take
much to go from that to "antisocial" or sociopath.</a>

Or we (as a society) may not be organized to deal with the non-norms
since our structures are organized for the "norm".</a>  Great article in
the November 1999 Esquire (pg 143) about the people with Mega-IQs.  For
example Christopher Michael Langan with an IQ of 195.  He works as a
nightclub bouncer and makes $6,000 a year.  His mother was "the black-sheep
daughter of a wealthy shipping executive" and his father was an
abusive control freak.  Sounds like a pretty good recipe for some
serious maladjustment to the norms in my book.

<p>
[Interestingly enough his crainial circumference is 25.5 inches,
3 std. deviations from the norm.  Says something for the correlation
between brain size and intelligence perhaps.]

Yes, and its going to be very interesting when we start to uncover
the polymorphisms in those genes and unravel their contributions
to "mal-adjustment".  ... Hey!, I'm not a mal-adjusted sociopathic
little twerp, I'm just "being" me!
