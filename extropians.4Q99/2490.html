Ron,

<p>
I beleive that all surface ships of any size make fresh from sea water
even given that the cost of energy can be quite high.  Even my boat can
make a couple thousand gallons a day with its reverse osmosis system.

<p>
This is done because even though shore water would be nearly free, the
space to store it would be incredibly expensive.  A 100 footer works out
to about 15,000 dollars a liner foot, and/or about 35 dollars per cubic
foot to purchase so every cubic foot is valued much to highly to make it
a large water tank. Then the energy required to move 10 or 15 tones of
water along with the craft would add up quickly as a continuing cost
factor.

<p>
Just my 2 cents worth.

<p>
Lee
