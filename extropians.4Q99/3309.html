I'm certainly starting to factor nanotech evacuation preplanning into my
schemes.  Drexler just has too much of a head start on me.  But on the
other hand, we can look at this optimistically; with enough luck, 2005
could see the debut of reasonably good AI.  Maybe enough for seed AI,
given massive computing power; enough for a nanotech-domain AI to
predesign a complete evacuation system, otherwise.

distributed over the Internet, my visualization called for the
development of massive supercomputers in any case, 'though I was hoping
they'd be rented out.</a>  (But building a research machine is certainly a
