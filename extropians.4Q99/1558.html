Pointing to a recent Gallup poll indicating that belief in ghosts and witches 
is on the rise in America, a friend of mine asked our mailing list (which 
includes another high school friend who is now a Southern Baptist preacher) 
<br>
"where are we going wrong?"  The following was my reply:<br>

<p>
Good question.  The increasing level of irrational beliefs among the American 
public is one of my prime irritants.  When I saw Newsweek's uncritical cover 
story this week about millennial nuttiness, I just about had an aneurysm.  I 
had to immediately read a few passages from Carl Sagan's last book (which I 
highly recommend) as an antedote.  

<p>
I had another blood curdling experience yesterday, which points to the reason 
for this rise in irrationality.  We were down in Houston's arts district and 
had lunch at a deli where the pierced and same-sex paired clientele is at 
least as entertaining as the art on the walls and the food on the table.  At 
the cash register are piles of free magazines.  There was one about gay stuff 
(naturally), a local Wired-ish computer mag, the stalwart Houston Press, with 
its usual muckraking leftist cover story . . . and then there was "Indigo 
Sun".  I picked this one up and took it to the table with my tray, since I 
couldn't immediately identify the micro-cultural niche at which it was 
targeted.

<p>
<a name="1565qlink1">This magazine turned out to be a local ju-ju rag, a vehicle for 
advertisements and "articles" written by the more prominent advertisers.</a>  In 
<a name="1565qlink2">it were items about angels, feng shui, homeopathy, a tribute to the 
Theosophical Society, an ad for computerized aura analysis, two different 
astrology columns and more of the like.</a>  Nowhere was there any indication 
that the Indigo Sun's readership might find any inconsistency among this 
pastiche of different belief systems.  Apparently the world and one's life is 
governed by geomancy AND the stars AND the allignment of one's spine AND the 
balance of the Aristotelian elements.

<p>
<a name="1565qlink3">Now turn the clock back even 50 years.  The appearance of such a magazine in 
a public place in the United States would be an unheard of thing.  Why?  
Because there were just two competing world-views on offer: Mainstream 
christianity (in two main flavors, which seem almost indistinguishable in 
contrast to the gumbo of superstition found in the Indigo Sun)</a> and scientific 
humanism.  Until relatively recently, the contrast between those two 
world-views was stark and was acknowledged by most of their proponents.

<p>
Then came postmodernist self-doubt and the democratization of culture.  
Drawing bright lines became an act of cultural imperialism.  Making clear 
distinctions was condemned as naivete.  Claiming to have found a superior 
philosophical methodology became elitism.  Truth wasn't possible, only 
<br>
"theory".  There was no truth; only "discourse" and "texts".  The political <br>
virtue of tolerance became the vector for a plague of uncertainty. Academia, 
which had heretofore been the redoubt of humanism, instead became a breeding 
ground for the contagion of postmodernism. A miasma of uncritical syncretism 
emanated from the academy.  In its wake, every form of charlatanism has since 
issued forth.

<p>
<a name="1559qlink1">Is asserting the intellectual superiority of the scientific method (or the 
revealed truth of the Bible, for that matter) a form of white male 
Eurocentric cultural hegemony? If so, then let's struggle against it and open 
our minds to other ways of knowing.</a>  Maybe science and religion AREN'T 
incompatible.  Maybe christianity and feng shui ARE compatible.  Maybe zen 
and general relativity are just saying the same thing.  I'm OK.  You're OK.

<p>
In light of the melt-down of the ideals of the Enlightenment in the 
postmodernist stew, it's no wonder that critical thinking has gone out of 
style.  Identifying premises and testing them for consistency and against the 
hard edges of the real world takes real work.  A willingness to conclude that 
an idea is false - especially one that has taken root in one's own mind - 
takes courage.  Condemning an idea that has taken root in someone else's mind 
as false takes diplomacy and tact, which take effort.  It's easier to simply 
believe it all and to tolerate other peoples' comfortable illusions.  When 
<a name="1566qlink1">that false tolerance is extolled as an intellectual virtue, one has truly 
encountered a vicious circle of mental corrosion.  The result is that the 
United States, a country founded on the ideals of the Enlightenment, has 
become the breeding ground for superstition.  I say give me</a> a fundamentalist 
<a name="1566qlink2">christian any day: At least we share a notion that some things</a> are true and 
<a name="1566qlink3">others are false.
