<p>
There is an interesting article coming out in the next edition of Business
Week entitled, "IBM:  The Biggest Dot.Com of Them All." It will be the cover
story in the next edition of Business Week.

<p>
Apparently, somebody just noticed that IBM is making a lot more money on the
Internet than the businesses usually considered to be Internet businesses,
like Yahoo!, America Online, Amazon.com, eBay and E*Trade.  Combining the
top 25 Internet Businesses together barely reaches 150% of IBM's Internet
revenue.  IBM has a reputation as a dinosaur, but apparently they are far
ahead in using the Internet when compared to "modern" businesses.  When
thinking of modern Internet-savvy companies, the common wisdom is to regard
IBM as old-school and to look at the modern Dot.Com companies for Internet
expertise.  Apparently common wisdom is wrong again.

<p>
I have noticed that often news reports concerning the state of technology or
business is just plain wrong.  They tend to report common beliefs as if they
were factual.  A recent news article I read said that while most toy stores
are touting Pokemon as the number one best seller, it isn't really.  Hot
Wheels cars are the biggest sellers, and other standard toys also top the
list.  Often, they hype heard in the media just doesn't match reality when
compared to the facts.
