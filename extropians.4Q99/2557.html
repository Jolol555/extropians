It doesn't take two successive SN to generate heavy elements.

<p>
Stars &gt; ~10 M_sun, burn successively through, C, Ne, O and Si, and end up
with an iron-group core.  A type II supernova then results in the dispersal
of some fraction of these elements and the formation of a neutron
star or a black hole.  Type-II supernova may also produce heavier
elements in the r(rapid)-process where a high neutron flux results
in the rapid production of heavier elements.

<p>
The more common path for heavy elements involves the s(slow)-process
and occurs in intermediate mass stars (1 M_sun &lt; M_star &lt; ~8 M_sun)
when it is in its asymptomatic giant branch (AGB) period, near the end
of its life (before the white dwarf stage).  During this period it
goes through He-burning cycles where neutrons are produced, captured
to form heavy elements that are expelled in the form of stellar winds.

<p>
Rapid &amp; slow refer to the neutron capture probability relative to the
half-life of radioactive isotopes.

<p>
The s-process is responsible for the production of most elements up
to Bi-209 (the heaviest nonradioactive element).  The r-process is
required to produce heavier radioactive elements (including uranium).

<p>
Since a star like Sirus with  ~2.3 M_sun will evolve to the AGB stage
in approximately a billion years, what *is* required for heavy element
abundance in a short time (hundreds of millions of years) is a collection
of stars with masses &gt; ~ 3-4 M_sun.
