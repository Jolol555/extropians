Hello everyone,

In 50 years, we'll both probably be alive and old, but reasonably
healthy.  I have $100 in 1999 US currency that says on October 15,
2049, US currency will still be in common use, most humans will
be born the old fashioned way, live on Earth, and be speaking
English or Hindi with their neighbors, and going to work to earn
more of that US currency to spend on the wonderful high-tech gadgets
that 50 years of slow, steady progress has created.  (Fortunately,
I can't lose this bet because if I'm wrong, I won't be around</a> topay off:).

I agree with Joe.<a name="1012qlink1">  The transformation of our society due to biotech, 
nanotech, A.I. and other key technologies in my view may not result in 
over-night world-shaking changes.</a>  I see a slower, incremental approach.  Of 
course much<a name="1012qlink2"> of how things develop will be determined by how society and 
government view these technologies.</a>  They may be embraced very carefully if 
seen as potential nightmares.  The developed world tends to be one of 
regulators intent on keeping power and knowledge under control at least 
where profit is not concerned.
<br>
Of course I could be totally wrong and these technologies could have a "life 
of their own" when combined with human corporate and government desires 
involving power, greed and mistrust.  In my "history of war" class we have 
studied how european nations competing with each other so much and for so 
long was a key factor in this geographically small area coming to dominate 
the world.

<p>
<a name="1012qlink3">I sadly think the world of 2050 may have an even worse problem of the haves 
and the have-nots.  I hope this is not so.  And in this world the rich would 
have advantages over the poor and middle-class unimaginable in our time 
which could lead to greater social strife.</a>

<p>
In 2050 I will be eighty-two years old if I am still around!  My family tree 
members tend to konk out around seventy but that is usually despite abusing 
their bodies with too much drink and lack of exercise.  I just might be 
willing to bet $100 against Eleizer on this one!  He will be a young man of 
just seventy when 2050 comes around!  He might have to wait till I come out 
of cryonic suspension to collect his $100 dollars!

<p>
In response to Joseph1(the NeoSapien) in regards to a human breeding project 
to raise the quality of the human gene pool I must agree with others that I 
don't see it as necessary.  Already nature has given humans quite a criteria 
for mate selection that has served us well.  Intelligence is a key factor 
for mate selection already though other factors include physical symmetry, 
ambition, status and cultural background.  We got to this level of cultural 
and technological development due to in large part these mechanisms.  Gotta 
impress those females any way we can!  The desire for sex and companionship 
is a huge motivator for our kind.

<p>
Within a few decades genetic engineering will make this discussion 
immaterial.  We will be on the next level.  At least those who can afford it 
will be.  Animosity toward the wealthy will grow as their offspring are 
gauranteed superior intellect, health and good looks via a rich parents bank 
account.  We will need a major government program to make this genegineering 
available to all parents even though they would most likely not get the same 
level of "uplift" as the wealthy.


<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
