I'm living in the Netherlands now. Although the government
here is rather prone to get involved with people's personal
life, there are a number of precautions that make it 'safe':
<pre>
- people are presumed innocent until proven otherwise
- evidence gathered by illegal means is void
- people have a number of rights that are guaranteed and that
</pre>
  can easily be used against the government without fear for
  repercussions (seems to be different in some other countries)
- the government and the judicial system are very much
  independant of each other
<br>
- the current trend is to teach and promote tolerance when
  it comes to other ways of life, other cultures, etc

<p>
&gt; The only place I'm aware of, that is less restrictive<br>
&gt; than the US is Hong Kong.<br>

<p>
Hong Kong? I think we might be talking about other kinds
of restrictiveness :)

Rik - who lost all mail between 15:30 and 21:10 UTC, sept 30th

      if you sent me anything important during that period,
      you know what to do :)
