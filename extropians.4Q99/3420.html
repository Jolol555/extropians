A question:

<p>
<a name="3435qlink1">(Please forgive me if this has been asked and answered previously.  I have 
been lurking for a bit, but by no means am I familiar with everything that 
has been said and discussed.)</a>

<p>
<a name="3448qlink1"><a name="3435qlink2">Concerning uploaded individuals.  Considering that such a being would, 
presumably, be immortal, and considering that such a being would wish to 
retain all of its memories (and probably with more clarity than is afforded 
by our protein brains, which are notorious for storing memories in a 
somewhat fuzzy and incomplete manner),<a name="3449qlink1"> there would seem to be some concern 
<a name="3435qlink3">about space.</a>  Certainly my computer could not hold even a significant 
</a>fraction of my memories.<a name="3435qlink4">  Now, admittedly, my brain is comparatively small, 
</a>
and seems to do alright, but most, if not all, of us have witnessed the loss 
of memories which tends to occur in the later years of a person's life,</a> 
<a name="3435qlink5">which results partially from the fact that there is a limited space capacity 
</a>for memories.<a name="3435qlink6">  One would want to retain all memories,</a> and therefore would 
want upgrades, spare hard drives, if you will.  Is this a concern?  Is it 
</a>
<a name="3448qlink3"><a name="3448qlink2"><a name="3435qlink8"><a name="3435qlink7">realistic to expect resources to hold out?  How many people are expected to 
</a>
</a>
</a>
</a>
ultimately be uploaded?
