Regarding this phrase "the holy hand grenade of Antioch" obviously you are 
not a Python fan, and the less said on that the better!

<p>
&lt;As for Uncle Waldo:

<p>
&lt;He is dead and probably decaying.  He is irretrievable until somekind of 
Tiplerian &lt;Omega Point. (which you can read about in Frank Tipler's book if 
you care to know &lt;more about it). 

<p>
I have read Tipler's "Physics" and his earlier work with John Barrow on the 
Final Anthropic Principle, I really did enjoy his work.  However, Professor 
Tipler has been extremely, quiet, regarding his Immortality book, and I am 
not sure if any other physical scientist has signed on to his Omega Point 
theory. Quite the contrary, he seems to have been uniformly and harshly 
criticized.  I have wondered if any of Professor Tipler's students have ever 
carried the baton forward regarding the Omega Point? Probably not.

<p>
So whether one is a theist, atheist, or agnostic; we are biologically all in 
the same boat of the good ship, mortality. How's that for closure?
