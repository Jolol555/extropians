Yes, evidence alone cannot convict. Testimony as to the circumstances
that the evidence was collected must corroborated by a living person,
under the principle of the right to confront one's accuser, to cross
examine it. You cannot cross examine an inanimate object. An inanimate
object cannot make an accusation. Every prosecution witness called to
testify is in effect an accuser. Even non-eye witnesses are in principle
accusers, because they are testifying as to how they collected,
processed, and/or analysed evidence, and what, in their expert opinion
(if they have one and are allowed to present it) conclusions can be
drawn about the evidence. It is this testimony that is an accusation
against the defendant.
