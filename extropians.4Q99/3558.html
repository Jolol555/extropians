Max and anyone else still reading this thread,

<p>
I cannot and do not give investment advice, so what I am posting here is
just my opinion and how I trade.  It is very true that short term
trading is not for most people.  Studies say that 90% of all short term
traders loose their entire bankrole within 1 year.

<p>
<a name="3561qlink1">Having said that, and again speaking only for myself, I would not try to
buy an IPO on its issue day.  The real money is if you can buy the
shares before they go public and sell on the opening when they issue
<a name="3561qlink2">100-200% above the prepublic price.  This massive selling by the
</a>
subscribed buyers is what causes most IPO to crater the first day,
expecially the first few hours.  Let them freefall for a half day or so
until they firm up, and if they are a real company, like redhat is, they
will start to climb again and you can buy and make a lot of money.  Most
IPO's take weeks to get back to the price they went public at.
</a>

<p>
I would also like to say that when I say fast execution of trades, I
mean 2 to 4 seconds from the time I enter the trade until I have
confirmation of the buy/sell.  You cannot do that with any broker or
even an online account such as etrade or amaritrade.  The only way to do
it is with a true edat acccount where your orders go from your screen to
the trading floor computers with nothing inbetween. 

<p>
I hope this is of help in explaining that I am not an stock investor in
most cases, I am a stock trader.  I do invest, but only with the money I
make trading.

<p>
Best to all,

<p>
Lee
