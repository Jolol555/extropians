Ok. You want blunt, here's blunt. (you did want blunt didn't you?)  Many 
posters have no idea what is outside their little, White Christian ,Aryan, 
timmy-boy Euro culture is like. Not everybody who believes in God is a 
Christian, and what the writers within such Christian and Non-Christian 
intellectual movements frequently don't get the media play because the the 
Fundamentalists are far more interesting to rant about. People who broadcast 
their prayers and have Toll-free numbers to donate to their cause, are much 
more interesting to watch then a Hans Kung type.  Try questioning Senior 
Bard, regarding the this viewpoint; he might surprise you.
