<i>&gt;have not been reading the list for a few weeks and do not want to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;involved in Kathryn's issues. However, after receiving a slew of private</i><br>
<i>&gt;mail from her I scanned the posts that involved this latest outburst and</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm responding. I have no interest in or time to continue after</a> this message.</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;  "...the fact that you are now putting together media material cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  discount earlier materials put together by people who have been doing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  this for years.  Also, the fact that we have been doing this for years</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  does not discount the work of your or other people who are putting</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  media materials and press kits together..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I suppose if you really stretched the limits of the language you might</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;be able to interpret that as an accusation that you've ignored earlier</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;efforts for some unspecified reason, but I certainly don't read it that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;way.  It reads to me like just idle chest-pounding:  Hey!  Look at me!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I've done that too! </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think Natasha was pointing out what had already been done and was being</i><br>
<i>&gt;done. Probably a good idea since Kathryn seems to see us as enemies</i><br>
<i>&gt;(something entirely of her creation) and so we can't expect to receive any</i><br>
<i>&gt;credit from her.</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;As near as I can tell:  Kathryn started it when she misinterpreted</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Natasha, then Natasha gratuitously used a curse-word.  I would say</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you're both about equally to blame for all this.  Furthermore, as far as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I can tell, you don't have anything to actually argue about, since as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*both* of you have stated your respective publications have nothing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;do with each other.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Eliezer's comment also made sense, from what I read. However, I can</i><br>
<i>&gt;understand Natasha's use of "crap" since we *have* been getting crap from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kathryn for no good reason. Kathryn has said that I "yelled" at her, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;is untrue, and she has caused trouble for Natasha over and over. Natasha's</i><br>
<i>&gt;use of "crap" may seem gratuitous, but given what she's put up with I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's *entirely reasonable*, if not as informative as it might be to those</i><br>
<i>&gt;not involved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not going to go over everything issue and past problem point by point.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I simply am not willing to expend my time and energy on this. Kathryn (and</i><br>
<i>&gt;one or two anti-extropians on the Transhumanist list) may want to fantasize</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I see her as an enemy. I do not. I see in Kathryn someone with many</i><br>
<i>&gt;good qualities, but I also see someone who persistently misinterprets,</i><br>
<i>&gt;makes harmful assumptions, and engenders conflicts. I don't have time for</i><br>
<i>&gt;this. I would not even post this message, except that I'm sick of seeing</i><br>
<i>&gt;Natasha being the object of this nonsense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With the time that I'm finally about to see opening up, I'm looking forward</i><br>
<i>&gt;to getting back to working on the ExI website, which badly needs updating,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and getting out an issue of the Exponent newsletter.</i><br>
