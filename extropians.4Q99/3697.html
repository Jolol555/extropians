'What is your name?'  'Zeb Haradon.'  'IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME
IS!!!':

<p>
<a href="3692.html#3697qlink1">&gt; So, a zombie might deceive others in convincing them that he is conscious,</a><br>
<i>&gt; but you cannot be a zombie and deceive yourself into believing that you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not, because you know (in a deeper sense, you are) your feelings. I would</i><br>
<i>&gt; indeed "say exactly that", but I wouldn't think exactly that. You are</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking for evidence that I can convince you that I am not a zombie. There</i><br>
<i>&gt; is none. This is an entirely different issue from that of what evidence you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can present yourself that you are not.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3704qlink1">Actually, I don't agree with the way you're using the word "thinks."  I
use the word in the functionalist sense: you're "thinking" if you're
exhibiting the right sort of functional properties.  You seem to be using
the word in some "deeper sense."

<p>
But you claim that the fact that you're Thinking, in whatever sense of the
word you're using, shows that you must not be a zombie, and that this
disproves my argument.  But you DON'T have absolute knowledge that you are
Thinking.<a name="3720qlink1">  You could be "thinking" (in the functional sense) but not
Thinking in the spooky sense.  How do you Know that you're Thinking when
you could just "think" that you're Thinking?</a>

<p>
<a name="3704qlink2">This is not an idle skeptical concern.  I really DON'T think that you're
Thinking.  I think that you're "thinking."</a>  If you're Thinking, then we as
</a>
<a name="3704qlink3">scientists and philosophers have a difficult problem on our hands,</a> and it
<a name="3704qlink4">casts some concern on whether uploading, AI, and a number of other handy
technologies are really possible.  If you're "thinking," then we've got no
problems at all.</a>

<p>
<a href="3692.html#3697qlink2">&gt; &gt;If you think that if "you" were a zombie, there would be no "you," then I</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;think the "you" you're referring to doesn't exist.  When I say "you," I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mean that thing sitting in front of a monitor reading this.  Whether that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thing has qualia or not is therefore up for grabs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ok. What I meant was my mind or consciousness.</i><br>

<p>
Right.  That's what I meant to deny.
