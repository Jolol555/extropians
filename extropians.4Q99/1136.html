Aaron, while I agree with much of your comment, I have to take exception to
this. Science does not (or need not) have *any* place for faith, if by
faith we are talking about beliefs that are held in the absence of or
contrary to the evidence--beliefs that are given an absolute foundation
utterly resistant to the possibility of refutation.</a>

<a name="1179qlink3">I think this point is exceeding important. To grant that science is based
on foundations of faith inevitably collapses the distinction between
science/reason and irrational faith. That this view is common is probably
the fault of a long philosphical tradition of rationalists and empiricists
who sought indubitable grounds for belief. They just couldn't seem to live
with the idea that maybe there aren't any. To me, the ability to question
your deepest convictions is one of the core aspects of being extropian. (So
go ahead and convince me that science is based on faith in the sense I've
stated--maybe I'm wrong on this very fundamental point...)</a>

<p>
Onward!
