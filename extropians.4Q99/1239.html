Well, if you look at the list of books they have up for sale, it is
clearly a small medically oriented publishing house.  I'm pretty sure
it is run by the MD that founded it.  We are probably lucky to be
getting a publisher as technology friendly as this one is.

Expecting them to be as "responsive" as the 900 lb gorilla with
enough money in the bank to start buying telephone companies is
a little harsh I think Hal.  If you are concerned just give them
a ring on the old-fashioned telephone.

I hear you.  Take a deep breath and focus your attention on the sound
of your blood running through your ears.  Now begin to feel at one
with the universe....  It will all work out just the way it does....
And that must be perfect because for it not to be perfect is an
illusion created by your mind that it can be any other way than
just the way it is....  Its always going to be ok, because thats
the only way that it can be.
