<i>&gt; Yep, if you can make them "aliens" ....</i><br>
<a href="3147.html#3163qlink1">&gt; then the barriers to killing them seem to fall quite rapidly.  Presumably</a><br>
<i>&gt; this is due to our omnivore heritage where if there weren't enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; edible plants around, we ate meat to survive.  There is even an</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument (I'm not sure how well founded), that access to high density</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy sources (such as bone marrow) was a requirement for a high</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy consumption brain to evolve.</i><br>

<p>
Anthropological theories suggest that a high quality diet was/is essential
for the evolution of the Homo brain. Doubling of brain volume (800ml to
~1700ml) with maintenance of body mass and concomitant loss of gut size
accompanied several dietary adaptations. Brain tissue comprises ~ 2% of body
weight, however it consumes ~20% of total energy costs. I believe that
heart, liver and testicular tissue are also high energy consumption organs.

<p>
High caloric density of diet was achieved by changing from a diet high in
leaves and woody plants to one of vertebrates, seeds and nuts. This met the
increased energy needs of the brain and increased digestibility demands of a
reduced gut.
<br>
Food preparation and cooking  are also thought to have compensated for the
diminished gut capacity.

<p>
Dietary manipulation whether for weight control, longevity, body building or
other goals, should therefore give consideration to both short term and long
term costs.
