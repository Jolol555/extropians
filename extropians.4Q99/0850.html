I dont have the cost of the missile on me, but I can assuuuuuuure you
Robert, they are pennies compared to an ICBM.

<p>
Perhaps not, but I would rather the emerging countries have
buttloads of THAAD missiles, that really are good for nothing
but knocking out incoming missiles, than seeing them obtain front line
fighter planes, bombers, etc.  In practice it may not work tho:
dictators love their fighters and bombers.  These may become
quite obsolete too: if we can hit a freaking *missile* it should
be trivial to hit an airplane.  {8-[

in a sense: nuclear subs.  As antimissile missiles make the
sub's payloads irrelevant, we convert them to great undersea
fission reactors [waaay undersea],  uninhabited, turning former
bomb material into power, which it delivers to the surface via long
cables [verrry long cables].</a>

If any kind of accident occurs, like the ones at TMI,
Chernobyl or the recent one in Japan, a few hundred
meters of water protects the environment, and should
a really bad meltdown happen, everthing goes to the
bottom of the sea.  The water solubility of plutonium is low
enough, there should be no three eyed fish born.</a>

<p>
Ja.  What I propose is getting rid of only the highly enriched
plutonium, so that no crazy yahoo will ever again be tempted
to make bombs outta the stuff.  spike
