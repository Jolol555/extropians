<a name="2054qlink1"><a name="2032qlink1"><a name="2031qlink1"><a name="2030qlink1">Here's a question for our aerospace professionals (and space groupies like 
me):<a name="2034qlink1"> How quickly after the development of a general purpose programmable 
assembler could a completely "de novo space program" be developed, and how 
many (or rather, how few) people with what expertise would be necessary</a> to do 
it?
</a>
</a>
</a>

<p>
Here's the scenario that generates the question: Imagine that a "classic" 
Drexlerian assembler is developed</a> and is available to a group of people 
having the goal of setting up an independent, self-sufficient 
extraterrestrial presence for biological humans as quickly as possible.  
Imagine that this group is working independently of the established aerospace 
companies.  The motivation behind the goal of getting off Earth fast would be 
two-fold: 1) to escape as quickly as possible from restrictions on 
development of transhuman technologies such as genetic engineering and 2) to 
establish some distance as quickly as possible from an Earth where Really Bad 
Stuff might happen once the availability of assembler technology becomes 
widespread.  

<p>
The goal is to establish a safe base away from Earth as quickly as possible.  
This base may be a temporary haven - a jumping-off point from which more 
distant, secure and dispersed settlements would be launched, again as soon as 
possible.<a name="2034qlink2">  Thus, I imagine that the immediate goal is to establish a presence 
on Luna, where raw material would be most quickly available for further 
development.  I know that it takes less delta-vee to utilize resources in the 
asteroid belt, but in this scenario, time is of the essence.</a>

<p>
<a name="2034qlink3">So, what is the minimum set of basic skills and how quickly can the posited 
"small band of nanotech-enabled transhumanists" get off Earth?</a>

<p>
<a name="2030qlink2">I envision the following basic scheme:

<p>
&lt;&gt; Some kind of very rapid recapitulation of the history of the manned and <br>
unmanned space programs.<a name="2034qlink4">  Thus a basic rocket booster would have to be 
<a name="2034qlink5">developed and proven with a minimum of tests and versions.</a>  This booster 
</a>
would ideally be 1) modular (so that it can be employed for a range of 
payload weights) and 2) fueled by material that could be readily synthesized 
using assembler technology (hydrogen and oxygen from water?)

<p>
&lt;&gt; A range of engines and fuel tankage systems</a> that could be adopted to <br>
exo-atmospheric vehicles of various sizes.

<p>
<a name="2034qlink6">&lt;&gt; Some kind of basic modular robotic spacecraft "bus" would have to be <br>
</a>developed.  This "Basic Robot Bus" ("BRB") would serve as a core navigation 
and communication module that could be applied to many different functions, 
such as establishment of an independent, secure orbital communication 
infrastructure for the project, both in Earth and Lunar orbits and beyond, 
and should also be easily adaptable to manned vehicles.

<p>
&lt;&gt; Modular robotic extensions for the BRB for use in on-orbit and lunar <br>
surface construction

<p>
<a name="2034qlink7">&lt;&gt; A lunar surface rover chassis for use of the robotic systems in preparing <br>
</a>a lunar habitat

<p>
<a name="2034qlink8">&lt;&gt; A basic manned spacecraft that could serve as a transit vehicle to be <br>
boosted up from Earth surface</a> to LEO

<p>
<a name="2034qlink9">&lt;&gt; A basic "hab module" that can be boosted into LEO and made part of a <br>
</a>translunar vehicle

<p>
&lt;&gt; A lunar lander stage that can mate to a standard hab module<br>

<p>
<a name="2034qlink10">&lt;&gt; Modular, scalable life support systems - from spacesuit to "hab module"</a> <br>
scale

<p>
&lt;&gt; (Maybe) a spacesuit.<br>

<p>
&lt;&gt; (Maybe) a reentry vehicle in case the whole thing falls through and the <br>
initial emigrants have to abort the program.

<p>
<a name="2034qlink11">&lt;&gt; A plan for robotic prefabrication of a basic lunar initial habitat.</a><br>

<p>
This seems like the minimum kit necessary to get off Earth in a hurry.  
<a name="2034qlink12">Assuming the basic technical capability of a fully programmable assembler 
<a name="2054qlink2">(i.e. the ability to make diamonoid structures of arbitrary size and 
complexity and thence the ability to extract basic elementary chemicals 
pretty easily),</a> how few aerospace professionals would need to be involved?</a>  
<a name="2034qlink13">What if they brought with them to the task only the knowledge that was in 
their heads and publicly available information?<a name="2054qlink3">   Given state-of-the art CAD 
</a>
circa, say, 2015 (assuming no runaway singularity in the meantime - which I 
do), how quickly could this minimal group start throwing stuff into orbit?</a>  
<a name="2034qlink14">How quickly could they start remote fabrication of an initial lunar 
</a>habitation?<a name="2034qlink15">  When could the first people get securely off Earth with a 
reasonable safety margin and a reasonable chance of maintaining their 
presence off Earth indefinitely?  I assume 1) that very simple designs might 
be possible and 2) a secure launch site would be available - but one that 
might not be secure for very long once hardware starts going up.</a>

<p>
<a name="2034qlink16">This thought problem is thrown out with the intention of seeing just how 
difficult the "I'm clearing out as fast as I can after the assembler 
breakthrough" scenario really</a> is.
