Was wondering what people thought of the idea of a borganism, originally 
multiples, which would have units in physical space and cyberspace.  We'll 
keep our initial borganism down to two units for now.  Let's say we start 
with a cryo patient that we want to upload, and the patient couldn't decide 
whether to become just software or to get a new body, so they do both.  The 
personalities of our cyber unit (C-unit) and physical unit (P-unit) start out 
identical, and we use some heavy telecommunications hardware and software to 
keep a high bandwidth comm channel between the two, through which they 
exchange memories realtime, but any other data is carefully vetted (on the 
theory that it is safer to have a false memory than a false personality 
download) by conscious introspection.  What do you think it would be like to 
be this borganism?  How closely connected would they have to be to truly stay 
one.  If they started diverging personalities, how would it affect their 
sense of identity given that they operate in such different environments?  
<a name="0231qlink1">For example, I could see our borganism interpreting differences in 
personality between the C-unit and P-unit as how it feels in different 
situations (yah know, I'm much more artistic in c-space than in p-space,</a> but 
<a name="0231qlink2">I like having a custom body out here in p-space all to myself, helps</a> with my 
</a>
<a name="0231qlink3">current experiments, though I do most of the modeling in c-space).  What 
would be the advantages and disadvantages to trying for the best of all 
worlds?
