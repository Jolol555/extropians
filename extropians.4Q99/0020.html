Strangely enough, I'd go retro.  I'd like something that had sort of a noir 
feel to it, cool and deadly, but that could break out into a driving beat at 
any minute.  I like the idea of dressing to the nines, tuxes and dinner 
jackets, flowing dresses daringly cut.  Enough tables to actually sit if you 
want to, but a live band swinging so hard you're not gonna want to.  Large 
dance floor.  People actually dancing with each other instead of in their own 
world.  Music that makes you feel and feel hard; has you crying one minute 
and grinning the next.  A bar where the drinking is done for the art of it, 
and not to see who can reach oblivion faster.  Some quiet nooks off to the 
side, where you can get to talk and otherwise get to know people.  One modern 
touch I would like is to build in some Instant Messenger, RTC system, so you 
can more efficiently find like-minded people in the crowd, but on an 
intranet.  I think I'd want to keep out the rest of the world, make this club 
a special place, a reserved place.  When you're there you're really there, 
and when you're not you'll just have to imagine what you're missing.

Sometimes, I still like the old ways....
