<a name="3299qlink1">In the olden days a drug called ``Ritalina'' existed which contained
amphetamines.  Would the ``Ritalin'' be identical to ``Ritalina''?
The manufacturer made ``Ritalina'' for people who wanted to lose weight.

<p>
As some doctors order amphetamines for young humans diagnosed with DAMP,
the above identity hypothesis seems to hold its water, as it were.
