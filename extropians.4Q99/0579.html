Sir, you have astonished and delighted me with the cogent and incisive clear
thinking in this paragraph. Thank you for that (and sorry about gushing). I had
nearly abandoned hope that extropians might see the need for dealing with issues
of violence as they relate to gender.

<p>
Did you know, for instance, that females commit more domestic violence than do
males?

Here are some citations with accompanying narratives. I'll send along more as I
compile them.
