Skipping, in a sense, to the end of the discussion (but, as I hope to 
explain, really not the end, but only an intermediate waypoint), J.R. Molloy 
posted an extended quote from an article by EO Wilson published earlier this 
year in the Atlantic:

<pre>
       "The Biological Basis of Morality"
         <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm</a>
       "A Scientific Approach to Moral Reasoning":
         <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/bio2.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/bio2.htm</a>

</pre>
<p>
which, as it happens, I've previously endorsed to my friends as containing 
very valuable insight into how we might finally be on course to develop a 
truly rational ethical philosophy.  I agree with almost everything Wilson 
says there and in his book "Consilience" about how inquiry into the 
biological basis of human morality can both illuminate what's worth revering 
in biologically-based moral sentiments, and also how we might go about 
developing more rational moral sentiments.

<p>
But Wilson's own thinking on these lines leads to what may be the limits of 
at least a biologically-based scientific approach to morality.  As I wrote in 
my review of "Consilience" in Extropy Online magazine

<p>
        <a href="http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/gbcurrent.html">http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/gbcurrent.html</a>

<p>
Wilson ultimately turns away from the prospect of transcending the human 
animal BECAUSE he sees biology as the only possible basis for a "scientific 
morality": He believes we should not transcend the human animal because it is 
only as humans - with our particular, evolved ethical instincts - that we are 
moral.  Wilson's style of evolutionary morality is ultimately 
backward-looking and provides little basis for a transhuman morality.

<p>
Now I do see that Wilson has in fact identified a solid basis for a rational 
and "scientific" morality that can guide humans through transcendence of 
their current biological form, and that is in his reference to game theory.  
By stripping moral calculus to the bare essential of foresight and 
intentionality, we can develop tools for crafting values that ought to 
transcend the accidents of evolution.  Only time will tell whether the kinds 
of rules we seem to have distilled from "toy universes" in simple models will 
be robust in the face of radically augmented intentional actors.  Let's hope 
so.

<p>
But to return to my perhaps incautious statement about "science" not 
providing a basis for moral choice, I certainly didn't mean that we can't or 
shouldn't be RATIONAL about moral philosophy.  However, in our rightfully 
high valuation of the scientific method, I think it's important that we not 
fall prey to naive "scientism".  The scientific method is a subset of 
rational thought (and there definitely seems to me to be levels of 
applicability of the classic scientific method of hypothesis, experiment, 
repeatabilitiy and falsifiability) but reason is not only those things.  It's 
not as if our approach to reality has to be "full-blown science or nothing at 
all."

<p>
Even within the natural sciences, we see a spectrum of applicability of these 
tools, with physics at one end and, say, evolutionary biology at the other.  
While it is certainly possible to do "experiments" by predicting that, say, 
fossils of a particular type ought to be found in geological formations of a 
particular kind (and then looking to see if they are indeed found there), the 
number of ecological variables impacting living systems makes 
narrowly-focused "experiments" difficult.  

<p>
Human behavior in society presents even more difficult problems in applying 
the classic formulation of the scientific method.  The number of variables is 
much higher than in any physics experiment and carefully-controlled 
experimental activity is circumscribed by ethical limitations on just what 
can be done to people.  And consideration of moral issues in any really 
meaningful way is always a question of humans in society.  Thus "science" per 
se - at least with the tools currently available -- makes only an incomplete 
guide to moral philosophy.

<p>
With these comments in mind, I'll address some of the posts in this and 
related threads:

<p>
I think that's a correct statement of a healthy reaction to Sokal's 
"experiment".  Close readers will know that I never miss a chance to take a 
shot at postmodernist hogwash.  But my criticisms of postmodernism shouldn't 
be mistaken for a belief that pursuit of the traditional humanities isn't 
worthwhile. Use of at least some of the traditional methodologies employed in 
the humanities - especially history, tempered by a deep respect for the 
scientific method as the most certain guide to knowledge - where it can be 
employed, is still a deeply important part of participation in the 
development of culture.

<p>
That's probably a correct statement at a high level of generality, but it 
doesn't really address the ultimate questions of moral philosophy.  I think 
the essay by Greg Johnson that Daniel Ust posted in this thread on 99-11-17 
06:42:11 EST sets out very well how pointing to "self-interest" alone doesn't 
provide real answers to ethical questions.  This is hinted at by the very 
term you use, "ENLIGHTENED self-interest": A lot of complexity and many hard 
questions are subsumed under the term "enlightened".

<p>
Two posts illustrate what I consider to be an excessive "scientism" regarding 
social and philosophical matters:

<p>
I understand and agree with Anders' point, although perhaps the example given 
isn't a good one - after all, the market can sort out architectural 
questions.  (There's an example in my neighborhood. An office building was 
constructed about ten years ago that had a hideous green, textured concrete 
surface.  I remember thinking when it was being finished, "What an eyesore!  
Who would lease space there?"  Well, apparently few people did, because 
eventually the building was completely stripped of the offensive coating and 
re-sheathed with an attractive and creative mix of different glass and steel 
textures.  It now appears to be fully leased-up.)

<a name="2456qlink1">This smacks of the kind of naive "scientific" approach to society that one

<p>
Here I note a personal response to comments of this kind similar to ones I've 
seen from other experts when people address the fundamentals of their 
expertise from what appears to be a lack of basic background in the area.  
With real respect to you J.R., I'm thinking of the frustration I've seen 
expressed by, say Robin when people talk about economics or by Natasha when 
people talk about art without having looked into the basics of the subject.  
<a name="2531qlink1">I don't by any means wish to discourage "amateur" discussion (in fact, it's 
one of the things I value most about this forum), but history and politics 
are DEEP subjects.  Yes, there's a lot of hogwash that gets propagated in 
these fields (just as there is in economics and art), but it's not all 
hogwash, by any means.  For good or bad, rigorous science ISN'T yet possible 
in the study of human history, politics and law (and may never be), but that 
doesn't mean that one can't find some truth, if only a relative and 
contingent truth.</a>  Navigating these realms is fraught with the danger of 
falling into the traps of total subjectivism on the one hand and simplistic 
scientism on the other.  As it happens, history teaches that both of these 
pitfalls lead to the same result: Totalitarianism.

<p>
This is an example of what I'm talking about.  It's probably true that deep 
down, all humans share a few basic needs and desires.  But a study of history 
will show that the devil is definitely in the details.  The disagreements 
about "how to do it" have given rise to a diversity of cultural phenomena as 
rich as anything one finds in biology or ecology.  History also teaches that 
people seeking simple solutions to questions of "the good" usually spill a 
lot of blood.

I think Damien has expressed well the complexities involved in considering 
ethical and social questions:

<p>
Or, to put it in terms of the question of "scientific" knowledge of social 
phenomena, people in society are like weather, only more so.  The fact that 
we have far from perfect models and that chaotic processes undermine the 
possibility of perfect knowledge doesn't mean that we can't have a science of 
meteorology, it just means that we have to understand the limits of 
prediction.  Transhuman technologies will, I suspect, only make the matter 
more complex and less predictable because, as I discuss above in connection 
with Wilson's "naturalism", we're looking to make the regime in which moral 
actors can exercise intentionality WIDER, not more narrow.
