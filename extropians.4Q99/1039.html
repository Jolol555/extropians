Congradulations. Yes and in some Universes we never go extinct, we being 
intelligent life, we being Anders Sandberg. Anders Sandberg in Universe # 
770,985, 123,035  has ascended to be Anders the Magnificent, intersteller 
explorer, and free-lance,gynecologist.  He among all the others, will 
increase the information load both inside and outside the universes. Why 
can't all the other Anders be like that one? Those slackers!</a>

<a name="1063qlink1">As far as Tipler goes (is he doing anything, lately?)</a> strongly stated that it 
will be organized intelligent life that closes the dimensions of the cosmos 
in 2 directions; not a purely "cosmological" occurence at all. So basically 
fast starships, even for tiny bits of super-intelligent dust (Hi Great 
grandchildren!) will be necessary to accomplish this.<a name="1045qlink2"> Have we even talked 
about trans-luminal travel or hypertime dimensions? That would be undermining 
the premises of currently responsible astrophysicists pardigm's ; or c.r.a.p.</a> 
for short.


<p>
Just be happy that the brilliance of those 19th century minds who said with 
such clarity that the Cosmos is in complete steady-state, and that capitalism 
would never adjust to evolving situations. Let us drink to an eternal 
unchanging universe, fellow comrade-worker.
