<a href="3082.html#3103qlink1">&lt;&lt; I don't want to try to tell you how to tell on a case by case basis who</a><br>
 is fooling themselves about what.  I just claimed that on average people
 in love do systematically fool themselves about several things.&gt;&gt;

<p>
If that is all you are claiming, then I would agree that people in the first 
blush of romance often do fool themselves about some things.  I apologize if 
I misunderstood; I had the impression that you meant that most people fool 
themselves into thinking that they are in love when they are not.  While this 
does often occur at the end of a relationship (very similar to the first 
stages of grief), I don't think it applies to love in general.  Again, I 
apologize for the mix-up if I misinterpreted what you said.

<p>
 &lt;&lt;Surely you are familiar with the standard literary scenarios of the 
foolishness of those in love, and those who were fooled by others who acted 
like they were
<br>
 more in love than their later actions suggest.&gt;&gt;

<p>
Yes, I am familiar with those and many other standard literary scenarios.  
However, just because it is a standard literary motif doesn't really tell us 
much about the prevalence of such scenarios in everyday life.
 
<p>
 &lt;&lt; I don't really care about you in particular.  But there is a vast 
literature
<br>
 saying that lots more than half the population think they are better drivers,
 lovers, stock traders, etc. than average.  Men tend to do this more than 
women.&gt;&gt;

<p>
Okay, most people suck at realistically assessing their own abilities.  I'll 
buy that.  The more pessimistic part of the population also tend to think 
they are a lot worse than they are really.  But the examples you give seem to 
me to relate more to what you can do than how you feel, and the distortions 
also are more of degree than type.  Not many people delude themselves into 
thinking they can fly a plane when they never have, though they might think 
they'd be better than they would be should they learn.

<p>
As for not caring about me in particular, that's fine.  But it seemed to me 
that you were trying to make your point by specifically referring to two 
qualities that I had claimed to possess.  As for thoughtfulness and 
creativity, I had stated that they were necessary to keep a romantic 
relationship alive and well; I never claimed that people were able to 
accurately self assess how good they were at these two things.

<p>
In summation, I agree that people often have distorted views of at least some 
of their qualities, and I further agree that people first in love will often 
gloss over problems and those whose relationships are failing often deny the 
signs of its failure at first.
