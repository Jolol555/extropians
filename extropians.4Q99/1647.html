I recall reading an article by Gold in Scientific American in the
1970s regarding what he then called his "Deep Earth Gas Hypothesis",
or something similar.  It was the same idea, that petroleum and natural
gas came from methane bubbling up from deep in the interior of the earth,
rather than from organic matter.

<p>
<a name="1667qlink1">Gold convinced a group to drill for oil in what was a highly unpromising
area by conventional standards, in the late 70s or early 80s, and as I
recall the project was a complete failure.  No mention of that in the
article quoted here, though, which seemed more interested in colorizing
the man than in whether his ideas are correct.
