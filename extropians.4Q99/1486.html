<p>
No, probability is a measure of confidence on the accuracy of our prediction,
it has to do with us not what we're guessing about, quantum mechanical
considerations excluded of course.

<p>
<a href="1483.html#1486qlink2">    &gt; Take the lottery for example.  Statisticaly any combination is just as</a><br>
<i>    &gt; likely as any other combintation.  But when you enter all those drawings in</i><br>
<i>    &gt; a database and do a comparison you notice that is not the case.  1 2 3 4 5 6</i><br>
<i>    &gt; does not occur nor any sequence of 6, by 1s, 2s, or what ever.  Why not?</i><br>

<p>
Because for cultural reasons there are only a few dozen or a most a few hundred
combinations that humans like and consider significant (123456, 654321,
666666 etc) and many millions that they don't. On a large golf course I paint
just  a hundred blades of grass red and then drive a golf ball, the ball will almost
certainly come to rest on a green blade of grass not red.

<p>
<a href="1483.html#1486qlink3">    &gt; So with coin flipping I compare the probability 50/50 based on the</a><br>
<i>    &gt;amount of flips I've already done and compare that to the statistical</i><br>
<i>    &gt;value of the  possibility of it comming up heads that many times.</i><br>

<p>
The coin has no way of knowing if it came up heads or tails before,
it's always 50/50. I just flipped a true coin 999,999 times and it came
up heads every time, what are the probability of that happening?
Answer,  100%, it just happened, I just saw it, my confidence that
it happened it total, 100%. Probability is about the future not the past.
 The probability that the next flip is heads is 50/50 (In the real world
I'd suspect it was a two headed coin but that's another matter)
