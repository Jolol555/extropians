About this time last year on this list we discussed last mile 
broadband solutions, eventually concluding that mass produced 
terrestrial lasers is a possible long-term solution, at least as a 
supplemental last link to a fiber backbone.

<p>
The October 1999 Scientific American covered the current state of 
mass broadband rollout.  The report discussed cable modems, DSL, 
LMDS, and LEO Satellite plans such as Teledesic.

<p>
See <a href="http://www.sciam.com/1999/1099issue/1099currentissue.html">http://www.sciam.com/1999/1099issue/1099currentissue.html</a>

<p>
They discussed the prohibitive costs of fiber-to-the-neighborhood 
(hybrid fiber/coax) and fiber-to-the-home.

<p>
LMDS is expensive to start up, requiring tens of thousands of dollars 
for the basestation equipment then thousands for network terminal 
equipment and antennas at each end-user point.

<p>
See <a href="http://www.alcatel.com/telecom/rcd/broadband_wireless_access/">http://www.alcatel.com/telecom/rcd/broadband_wireless_access/</a>

<p>
The LMDS solution can serve as many as 4000 users from a single base 
station, but the hardware costs prevent small ISP's from entering the 
market.

<p>
One solution that Scientific American didn't discuss is internet 
2.4Ghz internet radios which can provide between 1 and 1.676 Mbps 
between radio routers at ranges from 1 to 30 miles depending on 
configuration.

<p>
See <a href="http://www.rooftop.com/RadioDatasheet.html">http://www.rooftop.com/RadioDatasheet.html</a>

<p>
On September 2, Nokia acquired Rooftop Wireless of Mountain View, CA  
for $56 Million, and renamed the company to Nokia Wireless Routers.

<p>
The Rooftop design is elegent.  Multinode networks configure 
automatically, and can be extended create multi-hop networks covering 
great distances.  Presently, minimum network configuration consists 
of two radios, each priced at $1995.  Each internet radio has an RJ45 
10Base-T Ethernet connector.

<p>
With Nokia's purchase of Rooftop, the price of each radio will surely 
be reduced dramatically as a result of mass production for the lastmile
 consumer market.

<p>
One obstacle that "wireless ISPs" will face is discovery of service 
territory.  Local telephone companies will not disclose their Central 
Office locations, so it's impossible for an ISP to obtain a map of 
the territory outside the phone company's DSL service area.  
Currently, phone companies must perform a loop qualification test on 
a customer-by-customer basis to determine whether DSL is available to 
their homes.

<p>
How can a third-party competition be introduced when the mass-market 
service areas remain a mystery to would-be competing ISPs?
