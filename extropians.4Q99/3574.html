The people at LBL (and/or maybe LLNL) have the code (of course!)
and have modeled it for even such things as breast tissue.
But I think you need a very big computer and a big electrical
budget.  You probably also need certain security clearances
that they might not grant someone like me once they look
at my passport travel records.

<p>
There is also some code that I think the Army did that is
more generally available that the satellite people use to
model rad damage to satellites.  However I think it may be
heavily tuned for the earth environment (solar wind, flares,
etc.) and what we are discussing is somewhat different.

<p>
What we really need is micrometeorite modeling code and
I suspect that gets pretty expensive computationally.

<p>
But I believe the interstellar travel literature has some
good approximations and that collection is about mid-level
on my todo list.  Maybe by spring 2K.
