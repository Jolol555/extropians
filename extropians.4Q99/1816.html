Billy you raise some good points.  I ask myself, if I had the technology to
mind-control masses of people, would I use it?  Answer, hail yes, I would
cause the Taliban oppressors to cut the crap right now, and start acting like...

Nowthen, if the cost of having this power is the *existence of this power*,
would I wish for it to exist?  I need to think about that one.  Its almost like
the introspection the first nuclear scientists must have faced.  spike
