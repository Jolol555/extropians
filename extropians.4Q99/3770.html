I think networks will be getting dumber, and more orthogonal. There
will be little, if any, subvertable resources in them. You can't
<a name="3771qlink1">subvert a hardwired optical switch very much. The nodes will be
</a>
getting fatter and smarter, though. That's where the action will be.

<p>
Still, you need a lot of generations up the linear log plot before you
can have a god budding in your network without you noticing any
significant performance degradation. I would say a Blue Gene
equivalent in every game console would qualify for a supercritical
broth, maybe slightly less. (Which will probably need 2 1/2 d
molecular switches, if I come to think of it).

<p>
Once we're there I would tread very, very carefully: extinction alert.
