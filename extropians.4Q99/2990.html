<p>
You got it almost right.  RnM-LI is Rowen and Martin's Laugh-In.
I think the other was probably Flip Wilson's Comedy Hour but I
might be wrong.

Heart throb of millions of girls and women.  Remember
"Bye, bye, bye Delila".  I think it was the {Welsh?} accent
that did</a> it.

Dunno, but as far as I'm concerned you aren't dead until the
bacteria have recycled your molecules.

I think the "green" was for the masses and there was "blue" and
some other colors for the elites (presumably made from the finer
body parts, or higher class individuals...)

We probably do already, albeit at a slow rate.  They say use it or
lose it.  I just want to download it someplace safe in case I
ever need some of it.

Sometime when we've had a few beers, remind me to tell you the story
of "L'aventure de Robert en Paris"...  I assure you that you are not
