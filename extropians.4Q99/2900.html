<p>
The difference is that drones share many of the genes with the queen and
with the other bees.  I'm not sure of the details, but they may even all
be clones of each other.  At least that's how it is with ants.  It is
because the workers share so many genes with the reproducing organisms
that group selection works effectively with hive insects.

<p>
Without such close kinship, group selection has a weak effect and
will tend to be dominated by individual selection.  An individual who
reproduces will tend to have more of his genes propagated than one who
does not but who benefits the group as a whole.
