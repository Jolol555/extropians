I'd argue that the two of you with the same stories, constitute a
single (unique) "being".  The minute you let your stories diverge
(i.e. run the copies separately, you become separate individuals with
a large amount of shared history, i.e. identical stories).   This
is probably a few steps beyond people who have large amounts of
"normally" acquired shared history (twins or prisoners come to mind).

<p>
What defines a "unique" person is a "unique" consciousness operating
on the stories.  From my perspective a "consciousness" without any stories
is a pretty boring entity.  If you could empty a minds of all memories
(such as happens in some amnesia victims) and destroy that part of the
brain responsible for retaining new memories (as occurs in other types
of brain damage) you might have a very powerful "consciousness", but I
question whether you would have a "person".  If you did this with
two minds, I would say you were getting pretty close to having
non-unique consciousnesses (you have to deal with the genetic and
physiological differences to make them really "identical").
If you did that I think you would have the rough equivalent of
what you might get by buying 2 identical computers from Dell
with a lot of pre-installed software sometime between 2020-2030.

<p>
Putting it in terms of applied mathematics -- is a Turing machine equivalent
of a "unique person", the combination of the tape, read-write head,
the spools that hold the tape, etc. or is the "unique person" the
data on the tape?!?

<p>
I'm not sure that I understand what you mean by "psychologically continuous
person".  I would suggest that a person cannot be both "not me" and "me".
The statement makes no sense logically.

<p>
&gt; If all you want out of uploading is immortality, think again.<br>

<p>
First I want immortality, then I want to expand my intelligence,
then I probably want to run "experiments" on copies of my self
(maybe -- since the jury is still out on whether this is immoral).

<p>
<a href="3061.html#3092qlink3">&gt; Hell, you aint even the person that you</a><br>
<i>&gt; were ten years ago (and I don't mean that you've grown, I mean you are as</i><br>
<i>&gt; different from that person as you are from me, ethically speaking).</i><br>

<p>
Of course, the reason I'm different is because I have much different
stories now than I had ten years ago.  (Other than perhaps the more
obvious factors like aging.)
