<a href="3886.html#3931qlink2">&gt; I have only read one novel of Lem.  I forget the</a><br>
<i>&gt; title but the main</i><br>
<i>&gt; character was an astronaut who returns to Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt; after having been gone for</i><br>
<i>&gt; centuries.  He is seen as a dangerous throwback</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a world where everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; has been "treated" to be nonviolent.  I remember</i><br>

<p>
That was "Powrot z gwiazd" (the original Polish title -
don't know how this has been named in the English edition,
probably "Return from the stars" or s.th. like that); the
hero was a guy called Hal Bregg. Not really the best of
Lem's books.

<p>

<br>
<a href="3886.html#3931qlink3">&gt; I knew of Lem's stature but never got around to</a><br>
<i>&gt; reading any more of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; books though I enjoyed the one I did read.  I was</i><br>

<p>
You might be interested to take a look at the translation
that I started about two years ago of one of Lem's most
important books, "Summa Technologiae", which is a great
collection of early &gt;H ideas:

<p>
<a href="http://www.frankpr.myokay.net/Lem/lem.htm">http://www.frankpr.myokay.net/Lem/lem.htm</a>

<p>
Unfortunately, it has never been translated into English,
and I didn't get very far in my attempt (and to make things
even worse, my English isn't especially superb, so the style
might sound funny from time to time, which isn't Lem's fault
:)
<br>
Anyway, a few sections are there, and plans to translate
more. Enjoy.

<p>
Best,
<br>
Frank

<p>
P.S.: As a bonus (?), there is the first chapter of yet
another untranslated book of Lem, "Dialogs".
