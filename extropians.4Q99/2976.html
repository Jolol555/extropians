That would depend on whether they could interbreed with non-uplifted members
of their species.  I think it might be best to make for some sort of species
isolation such that the uplifted member of a species is reproductively
separate from the nonuplifted members.  However, in practice, I do not know
if anything we can do would make that possible given the ways octopodes have
sex.

<p>
More to think about!

<p>
BTW, in the previous debate on this, one of the things I liked about
octopodes was their speed of reproduction and the number of offspring.  If,
e.g., uplifting were to be made illegal, this would be a way to present the
powers that be with a fait accompli -- i.e., an uplifted species that would
be hard for them to isolate or root out.  This is, of course, assuming that
the uplifted species is not something that we would want to root out.:)
