A WJLA reporter was kind enough to pull together their sources on this story.
It was originally posted on the AP wire, and this is a summary:

<p>
According to Karen Infeld, spokesperson for the Baltimore Eye Institute,
Stevie Wonder had met (at an undisclosed time) with physicians from Johns
Hopkins to discuss the possibility of undergoing an experimental procedure
that could give him sight.  The procedure would have involved the insertion
of a computer chip into his retina to allow him to see shapes and colors.

<p>
The medical staff Stevie Wonder met with determined that the procedure
probably would not help him, because the damage to his eyes was too great.
Wonder made a statement at a memorial service in Detroit last month, that
he remains committed to trying a procedure, if there was even a chance it
would give him the ability to see.

<p>
(I can see where this leaves some room for ambiguity--maybe he can talk his 
way into getting the procedure, maybe not.  More to come....?)
