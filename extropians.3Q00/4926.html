<P>
Emlyn O'Regan wrote many wonderful notions in his homeless post, including:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...As far as I can see, the tools have improved incredibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beyond what I was using 10 years ago when I started uni. So much more is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible; it's astounding. And yet, paradoxically, it is harder than ever to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a programmer. The job is getting more and more difficult. Why?
</EM><BR>
<P>So, Emlyn has been hiding his light under a bushel.  Why do you
<BR>
indulge in as many wisecracks as... I do, when you are capable of
<BR>
writing insightful passages like these?  Shame!  {8-]
<BR>
<P>Your notion of software implosion is something I have pondered often.
<BR>
I am surely not alone when I confess I have developed code (excel
<BR>
macro upon macro upon macro) which eventually became so
<BR>
spaghetti-ed and complicated, I could no longer debug the mess.  It's
<BR>
easier to start over and do it right than try to fix the abomination.
<BR>
Excel invites this kind of morass, because the macros start out
<BR>
simple, then one tends to add shell after shell over time, kinda
<BR>
like... windoze 98.
<BR>
<P>For instance, every sophmore physics student has been asked
<BR>
on a test to answer a question like this:
<BR>
<P>An artilleryman fires a cannon ball at 500 meters per second
<BR>
with the barrel 30 degrees from the horizon.  How far does
<BR>
the ball travel before it hits the ground?  Assume flat earth
<BR>
and no atmosphere.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, the sophomores all derive the equation
<BR>
&nbsp;s=2V^2/g*sin(alpha)cos(alpha) with a couple lines of
<BR>
calculus, but doesnt it make you crazy?  No one has
<BR>
yet fired a shell on an airless planet!  What about that air?
<BR>
<P>The next part of the physics problem asks you to show
<BR>
that the optimal angle for max distance is 45 degrees, again
<BR>
assuming no air.  The student takes the derivative, gets
<BR>
constants times sin^2(alpha)-cos^2(alpha), sets that to
<BR>
zero, gets alpha is 45 degrees and shes done.  But still,
<BR>
no artilleryman has ever fired a shell in a vacuum, so
<BR>
what do you do?  Do you fire the cannon a little lower
<BR>
than 45 degrees, to shorten the path a little, or aim a
<BR>
little higher than 45 degrees to get up into the thinner air?
<BR>
<P>Turns out, this is one hell of a difficult problem to model,
<BR>
which is why the sophomores dont get to solve it.  The
<BR>
atmosphere is difficult to model with a closed form equation,
<BR>
so you need tables to get very precise, so you need...
<BR>
excel!  You get a good atmosphere table, use the VLOOKUP
<BR>
function, and sad to say, a geek can entertain himself for
<BR>
*weeks* if not months, fooling around with optimizing
<BR>
trajectories.
<BR>
<P>It gets worse from there.  It is easy to set up a spreadsheet
<BR>
that calculates every second, looks up an atmospheric
<BR>
density, calulates a drag, repeats.  But then, well, the
<BR>
atmosphere table is in increments of 500 meters, and thats
<BR>
course, so why not write a linear interpolator?  Well, then the
<BR>
atmosphere is actually more exponential, so how about
<BR>
an exponential interpolator?  Next, a drag coefficient
<BR>
routine that accounts for the increase in drag at and above
<BR>
mach 1, then lets correct for deltas in viscosity of the
<BR>
atmosphere, and pretty soon its a mess of code that grows
<BR>
and grows in an uncontrolled fashion, layer upon layer,
<BR>
until it can no longer be debugged.
<BR>
<P>The whole project is a total loss.  Easier to just start over,
<BR>
and do it right this time.
<BR>
<P>I can very easily imagine this case being analogous to what
<BR>
could happen to our interconnected networks.  It really
<BR>
could overwhelm our best efforts.  At this point Im not even
<BR>
part of the solution, Im still part of the problem.  spike
