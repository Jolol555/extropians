I don't see why eugenics on the national/global level needs to be instituted in a world where transhuman technologies will vastly upgrade our race anyway.  Let the individual and family decide what to do.  I think eugenics is an outmoded notion which smacks of fascism for good reason.  We WILL get the uplifting of the species, but not by the centrally planned route of &quot;good human animal husbandry!&quot; lol  
<BR>
<P>And as others have stated, their are real advantages to keeping the gene pool filled with plenty of &quot;variety&quot; in case of some type of unforeseen plague or calamity.  
<BR>
<P>And doesn't nature/life in the form of mate selection and social currency keep the genetic fitness of our species at a pretty high level anyway?  It's just that the &quot;below the curve&quot; folks have to generally find others of their level to mate with.  If you want quantity in terms of &quot;superior&quot; people I can understand eugenics, but the social strife engendered by a major program for it could be explosive.  
<BR>
<P>With transhumanistic technologies developing, &quot;nature&quot; can be allowed to take its course and we will have the new exciting race(s) of humanity we dream of.
