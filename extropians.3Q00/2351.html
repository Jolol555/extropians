<EM>&gt;   If no human action is selfless, how is Savant right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   If self-satisfaction is not the goal toward which all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   humans aim, then what is the goal of all human action?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   It seems to me that what Savant claims to be a logical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   fallacy is in fact an inherent truism of human action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   If it isn't a truism, then please identify an action
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and/or goal of a self that is truly 100% selfless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Seems to me that identifying such is impossible.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm not very familiar with rand's philosophy, but this post
<BR>
seems self-contained. it appears to me that savant's very point is
<BR>
that the notion of telic self-gratification is unfalsifiable -- a
<BR>
truism. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is, could i not say the same about ... water? i could say
<BR>
that whatever water does, it maximizes water's happiness, and there
<BR>
would be no way to prove me wrong. however, this conjecture would be
<BR>
useless (we would not be able to predict water's behavior any better)
<BR>
even if it were true because the happiness of water can not be
<BR>
measured; the idea is an empty self-reference.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what is the difference from human beings? perhaps the belief that
<BR>
human beings have a choice, that we can measure our happiness and
<BR>
even potential happiness by introspection, and act on it. however,
<BR>
isn't that a contradiction? how can we have free will and yet be
<BR>
unable to choose in a manner contrary to self-gratification?
<BR>
afterall, once we perceive the relative happiness payoffs of
<BR>
various potential actions (the perception lying forever beyond our
<BR>
will), we can not help choosing the one that maximizes our
<BR>
happiness. when we see a monotonic choice, occam's razor tells us
<BR>
that there is a causative link.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another thought experiment --  what if i said that the goal of all
<BR>
human actions is to maximize human _sorrow_? this too is unfalsifiable
<BR>
in the sense that savant pointed out, but somehow it sounds less true. 
<BR>
this seems to indicate that the notion of happiness is not completely
<BR>
empty, that finally there's is some difference from sorrow. oops
<BR>
... let me back away from the minefield.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the end, i think the notion that people act in order to maximize
<BR>
happiness is a bit like saying that switches toggle in order to turn on
<BR>
lights. give up the causa sui, and all the strange loops dissolve.
