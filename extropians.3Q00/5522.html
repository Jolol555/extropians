<P><EM>&gt; Mike Lorrey wrote, quoting me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And for it to be useful in the examples cited, you have to be ready to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; kill in response to an assault of less than lethal magnitude.  You need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be ready to kill in response to robbery, for example.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hal, thats clearly false, since she did say one person was beaten to death,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and given the statistics of risk of being killed during a rape, robbery, etc,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there is a significant probability of deadly harm in such events, and given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that its been proven that you are at least 30% more likely to survive such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crime if you are armed with a gun, then not carrying one is simply stupid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think what I said is false.  In most cases a rape, robbery,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc., is &quot;an assault of less than lethal magnitude&quot;, don't you agree?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And by being armed in case of such confrontations, &quot;you have to be ready
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to kill in response&quot;, don't you agree?  This is exactly what I said.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless you have ESP, there is no way for a person to know whether any particular
<BR>
case will be lethal or not, so claiming that just because some are not is
<BR>
disengenuous. I suppose you don't carry life insurance either? No cryonics account?
<BR>
Do you drive at night without headlights or a seatbelt or airbag? Are you such an
<BR>
incurable optimist?
<BR>
<P>The fact is Hal is that even if a criminal has absolutely no actual intent at all
<BR>
of killing you, that is irrelevant. It is your perception of lethal intent (i.e.
<BR>
that gun or knife he/she is pointing at you, or the death threat they made to you)
<BR>
that is all that is required. You have absolutely no way of knowing what their
<BR>
actual intent is, but it is safer to assume that someone that points a gun or knife
<BR>
at you in a threatening manner does have a far greater probability of killing you
<BR>
than someone who waves at you and wishes you a good day.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Don't you agree that if you are carrying a gun and will use it in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case you are robbed, then &quot;you need to be ready to kill in response
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to robbery&quot;, as I said?  As you and others have stated many times,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you should not carry the gun unless you are willing and ready to kill.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if you are going to carry and use it in cases of robbery, then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must be ready to kill in response to robbery.
</EM><BR>
<P>In many jurisdictions (including Virginia, Vermont, NH, Maine, and others), one has
<BR>
the right to use deadly force to protect oneself, one's family, and ONE'S PROPERTY,
<BR>
so being robbed, at least with the use of a deadly weapon by a perp, deserves a
<BR>
deadly response. You have no way of telling whether they are going to kill you
<BR>
after they rob you, and assuming anything else is betting your life on the kindness
<BR>
of someone who has proven themselves to be inconsiderate of your rights already.
<BR>
Not a smart idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or have I misinterpreted you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Very much so, though I think its more a matter of your comprehension.
