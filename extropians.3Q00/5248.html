<EM>&gt; So now you know just a bit more about me.  Often, while I have nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be ashamed of, I don't mention that part of my history simply because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most people haven't much of a clue what that is and is not about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Images from Jerry Springer or some such nonsense dance through their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heads.  Or they think in dozens of stereotypes and think that I must fit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in some or most of them.  Which of course I mostly don't.  Or they see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it as a &lt;gag me&gt;  &quot;lifestyle choice&quot;.  Increasingly I believe the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way to counteract the lack of understanding and the stereotypes  is for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more real people who are TS to simply be open.  So howdy.  Pleased to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meet you.
</EM><BR>
<P>More power to you- I've met a few TS/TG folks, and I simply treat them
<BR>
as people... the CEO of Applied Space Resources, Denise Norris, is TG,
<BR>
and I was amused to see the incomprehension of most of the engineers at
<BR>
a space conference who met her but didn't notice a thing.  I suppose
<BR>
engineers are notoriously oblivious- but she is at least 6'3&quot;, not
<BR>
exactly a delicate flower...
<BR>
<P>I was pretty pleased with most of the people who *did* finally realize
<BR>
her status- they thought about it, mentally shrugged, and carried on
<BR>
because it was irrelevant.  The consensus was, &quot;Oh, so Denise is
<BR>
transgendered?  So what. I still think that dog is a stupid mascot for
<BR>
the lunar retriever...&quot;
<BR>
<P>For more about ASR, see
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.appliedspace.com/corp_info/corp_info.htm">http://www.appliedspace.com/corp_info/corp_info.htm</A>  I really would like
<BR>
to see them succeed, but I ain't sure they can get the investment they
<BR>
need.
