<P>The Nazi party was heavily influenced by the Thule group, which were a
<BR>
Nordic occult group formed around the turn of the century.  Many high
<BR>
ranking Nazis were members of Thule and much of the party ideology and
<BR>
symbology came from there - the swastika being an ancient sun wheel symbol
<BR>
(used a lot by Jews in the past) and the SS insignia being two Sigel runes
<BR>
signifying a spiritual victory.
