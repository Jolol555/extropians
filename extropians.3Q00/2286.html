<EM>&gt; &gt; Question for those who decide not to write an essay: is anyone willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to pre-read essays for those of us who do submit one?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Count me in, or even post 'em.  It's not off topic and I'm sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; comments would be plentiful (and we can hope, mostly constructive).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alright.  Here's draft 1 of my entry.  It's probably a piece of crap -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but then, it *is* draft 1; only the final draft has to work.  (If I get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough comments to do significant changes, I'll probably post draft 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next weekend.  Of course, the final draft has to go in before 8/14...)

<EM>&gt; &quot;Specialist&quot; is such a dirty word.  I prefer &quot;focused&quot;, because that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I am guilty of: focusing on one subject.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Although this may seem unfashionable at the midpoint of the 21st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; century, I assure you that it is a practice that was quite popular up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until recently.  Indeed, until the end of the 20th century, it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible for people even in the most technologically advanced nations to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn only a few basic facts about how the world worked, stop learning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at around age 18, and live full and productive lives.  Only the elite -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientists, engineers, chief politicians and businessmen, and a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others - needed much more information to do their jobs.
</EM><BR>
<P>THis is a pretty arrogant statement to make. The only people I know of who get
<BR>
by on only a high school education are burger flippers (and treating only formal
<BR>
accredited bachelor or higher programs as 'education beyond age 18' is even a
<BR>
higher level of arrogance). A larger percent of people WITH four year degrees I
<BR>
regard as not only having sub-average intelligence, but pathetically low
<BR>
interest in 'how the world works', where I know many less formally educated
<BR>
people who are not only well versed, but give a damn. These are postmen,
<BR>
mechanics, sales people, etc. I, for example, am a college dropout. Everything I
<BR>
know about what I do for a living (computer consulting) I learned outside of ANY
<BR>
accredited program. I also happen to read the newspaper every day, front to
<BR>
back. I've got a better idea of what is going on in the world and how it works
<BR>
than about 90% of the college grads I know (a large percent of whom work in jobs
<BR>
that have absolutely nothing to do with what their degree is in, jobs that
<BR>
frequently have no degree requirement, like waiting tables.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even then, some people advocated lifelong learning as a path to a fuller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life, but this movement never really caught on until recently.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, lifelong learning is a pretty popular path today. More people
<BR>
earn bachelors degrees after age 30 than before it today (similarly for masters
<BR>
degrees).
