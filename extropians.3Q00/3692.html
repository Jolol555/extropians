<BR>
<EM>&gt;In the spirit of survivor, I propose a new sport, the optimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strategy of which is unclear.  The game is to see who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;walk (or run) the greatest distance, assuming that the competitor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must carry *all* necessary supplies, food, water, whatever else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might be needed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To make the competition end in a reasonable time, we would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make the competition in Death Valley in the early fall, so its not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so very hot, but is very dry.  This means most of the payload
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be water.  Again to speed the competition, the walk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ends if the competitor stops for more than 5 minutes.  All the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competitors get a GPS receiver connected to a phone.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that receiver gets the same number for 4.5 minutes, a warning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tone sounds, and if it hasnt changed 30 seconds later, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pickup crew is called.  This of course would preclude sleeping,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so the contest is unlikely to last more than about 30-40 hrs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the winners having traveled perhaps 150 km.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;This is virtually indistinguishable from an existing sport. There is a
<BR>
race where people run from Badwater (in Death Valley) to Whitney Portal
<BR>
(which appears to be nearly 150 km by road). I know someone who plans to
<BR>
run this race next July (he hopes to make it in 40 hours, which precludes
<BR>
sleeping), and then climb Mt. Whitney. It's sufficiently similar to races
<BR>
he has run in the past that I won't be surprised if he finishes as he expects.
<BR>
It isn't clear that your 5 minute rule would have much effect on his strategy.
<BR>
Rules about contestants carrying their own water presumably affect the
<BR>
maximum distance people can manage, but I wouldn't expect them to have
<BR>
major effects on the character of the race.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;For a truly new (and not yet feasible) class of sports, I suggest ones
<BR>
where contestants can't learn from direct experience, but instead need
<BR>
to learn by observing copies of themselves. My inspiration(?) for this
<BR>
class of sports comes from Monty Python's &quot;Being Eaten by a Crocodile&quot;
<BR>
competition (which should provide a hint about how serious it is), but
<BR>
I haven't been able to work out details that would make it a good test
<BR>
of skill.
