<EM>&gt;  No, I don't; rational thinking is not inspiration, and can never substitute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  for it. Well, maybe a more intelligent being can use rationality to do what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a less intelligent being would have to use inspiration/intuition for, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the more intelligent being can still use inspiration to reach even further.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  But this is still in the context of, and entirely bounded by, rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  thought. You can use inspiration to decide what to prove/test, but rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  thought must do the proof/testing.
</EM><BR>
<P>...this is a very keen paragraph. 
<BR>
<P>Forms of thought. The exploration of the effect of thoughts (of god or 
<BR>
otherwise) is a far more productive exploration that the exploration of proof 
<BR>
for (or against) god. 
<BR>
<P>The thought forms we create  -- literally shape our existance. Like a blue 
<BR>
print, inspiration or rational, we make our thoughts into buildings, churches 
<BR>
or garages, into skyways, teleportation devices or microwaves.... 
<BR>
<P>In that way, and in that way only, god does exist. Not because there really 
<BR>
is anything out there &quot;shaping&quot; things, but because for so damn long, our 
<BR>
existance has been infinitely shaped by the thought(s) that he/it does. And 
<BR>
the following mayhem or order depending on your world view. 
<BR>
<P>Things would be very very different if the &quot;god modules&quot; weren't installed in 
<BR>
us. Unimagineable to say how.
<BR>
<P>No one can say that a thought is reality,  yet to deny it's existance is 
<BR>
lunacy. There lies the conundrum.
