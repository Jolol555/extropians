<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Greg makes some points -- lets partition them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  1) Remote colonization by &quot;unconscious&quot;, &quot;undivertable&quot; sub-SIs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  In this case, I think it comes down to the problem of &quot;remote&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  matter (or energy) is of much lower value than &quot;local&quot; matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and energy.  It isn't the cost of getting the probes over to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the remote star that is the problem, it is the cost of getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the remote matter &amp; energy *back* to the local star where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it is of value to you.  &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Fuggedaboudit.  I assume moving matter over interstellar distances is a 
<BR>
no-starter in terms of net economic benefit from getting more atoms.  Any 
<BR>
technology that could make it pay to go get atoms from other star systems 
<BR>
would make all the rest of your (and my) projections in this realm 
<BR>
meaningless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Even if you don't send back matter &amp; energy, presumably you do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  communicate and the communication costs will be lower if you get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  closer.  How close you get will be determined by the cost to change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  your orbit relative to the volume of communication you would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  like to do.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on what you want to communicate.  Consider how many people devote 
<BR>
themselves to the study of history.  They know they'll never be able to talk 
<BR>
to Thomas Jefferson or Cortez or Chuang Tzu, but they spend a lot of time and 
<BR>
energy to this &quot;one-way communication&quot;.  Getting bits from a daughter SI 
<BR>
would just be INTERESTING.  Carrying on a two-way conversation, albeit VERY 
<BR>
slowly (especially by the standards of the fastest computations possible by 
<BR>
SIs), might also be rewarding, although in a way we can hardly imagine.
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt; 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  2) Colonization by unhappy sub-SIs looking to expand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  In this case, you have to make a case that the sub-SIs are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  independent enough from the SI that they have sufficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  personal freedom and autonomy to accomplish this.  England
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  certainly didn't let the colonies go &quot;willingly&quot;.  
</EM><BR>
<P>No - but it STARTED the colonies willingly.  And I assume we can do better 
<BR>
than apply the kind of mercantilist economics that held sway at the level of 
<BR>
&quot;national policy&quot; in the First Age of Expansion.  After all, the motivations 
<BR>
of most of the COLONISTS were quite different from those of the &quot;Mother 
<BR>
Country&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Presumably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the SI keeps sub-SIs either happy enough or relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  powerless so that any sub-SI probe/colonization ships
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that get sent out get zapped before they get very far.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK.  Assuming a &quot;Singleton&quot; to use Nick's term.  I'm not at all sure that's a 
<BR>
certainty, but I'll accept it for the sake of discussion.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Remember that the more information content the sub-SIs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intend to take with them, the more matter or energy is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  going to have to be involved.  Hey -- &quot;What is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Galaxy Class Starship you are building there?&quot;  &quot;You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are only authorized to build &quot;Delta Flyers!&quot;  As soon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as the SI gets wind of any solar-system changing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  activities in a nearby star, you can bet it is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to investigate.  If SIs have the ability to dominate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  local regions of space then the sub-SIs have to go further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  away (taking longer or using much more energy, making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  them much more noticable).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that &quot;information content&quot; is THAT big a factor in the mass of 
<BR>
a colony seed.  Distance probably is, if for nothing other than shielding.  
<BR>
But again, I'm assuming an almost &quot;dormant&quot; seed, so the information can be 
<BR>
packed pretty densely.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  If you have a moderately open society, SIs might let sub-SIs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  leave, but presumably there would have to be some very interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  treaty arrangements for future allocation of interstellar resources.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (When you come down to the last 4 H atoms in the universe, who gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  them?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you sure you weren't a Spanish colonial official in a former life, 
<BR>
Robert?  Consider how difficult it would be to police such &quot;treaties&quot;.  You 
<BR>
have to have what amounts to a Galactic Armada to do that.  Makes for good 
<BR>
space operae . . . but I think it's much more of an economic fantasy than 
<BR>
colonization in the first place.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  It seems the only cases where colonizers have let colonies go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  freely has been done is where the cost of administering them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  was lower than any benefit they could provide or when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  colonies unexpectedly overthrew the administrative system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and grew so fast that the cost of winning exceeded any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  long term benefit they might provide (from the perspective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of an analysis done at that time).  It would be really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  interesting to study all of the colonizer/colony cases,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  their relative economic, military, etc. strengths &amp; weaknesses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  abstract them to some basic economic principles and see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  how they apply vis-a-vis the SI/sub-SI relationships.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  You get into questions like, &quot;Would the American revolution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have succeeded *if* America had been where France is?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure there are lots of folks who have done some modeling of colonial 
<BR>
relationships, but I don't think such models would be of much use (within the 
<BR>
solar system, perhaps - I'm not totally convinced that there will be a sudden 
<BR>
&quot;flash&quot; from essentially no intelligence off Earth to a solar-system-scale SI 
<BR>
- but that's another question).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  If the pilgrims has been &quot;ants&quot;, I don't think King George
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (a human) would have had anywhere near as many problems with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the colonies.  (Insert cartoon of King George stepping on an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ant hill).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that's really a more apt metaphor, because the &quot;seeds&quot; I'm imagining 
<BR>
would be to a true SI far less than an ant is to a human.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  3) Colonization choices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  There is a final aspect of this that I have been working on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  which revolves around the question of if you have the freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to colonize, &quot;What do you colonize?&quot;  It turns out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  brown dwarfs and M-class stars are *much* more abundant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  than the stars we can actually see.  Brown dwarfs particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are going to be easier to dismantle because they are smaller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and cooler (you can burn their H in thermonuclear reactors).  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  But so far my very rough calculations suggest that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  may take a long time to dismantle (perhaps millions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  years).  If that is accurate, Robin's theories may be correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  but the colonization wave may proceed very slowly because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the time constraint *isn't* light speed, but time it takes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  dismantle large amounts of matter in gravity wells.  So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  large numbers of the Milky Way's Brown Dwarfs may be in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  process of being dismantled to contribute to the MBrain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  population.  That is interesting from the perspective of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  what the Microlensing Observations *did not find* --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  no rogue planets and no brown dwarfs!  Our galaxy *may*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be being consumed and the tasty bits are going first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The tasty bits *aren't* the closest ones but the ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  you can dismantle the fastest.
</EM><BR>
<P>But I think Robin's model doesn't assume that the colonization wave waits on 
<BR>
full development of each node.  Rather, low-cost seeds get launched as soon 
<BR>
as a node is developed to the point that it can launch a replicating seed.  
<BR>
Obviously, this parameter is crucial to the question of the &quot;burn rate&quot; of 
<BR>
the wave.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I suspect there may be a frontier beyond which it makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  absolutely no sense to quickly return any matter and energy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the parent because the transportation costs are *so* high.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It may be better to send out a probe, construct only what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is necessary to give a brown dwarf or star a gentle nudge,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  setup a &quot;this system is the property of SI 293203 beacon&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (and berserker drones if necessary), then wait 10,000,000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  years for it to show up on your doorstep rather than wasting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it all just so you can get your next meal a bit earlier.
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems like the slow accumulation of so much matter would have 
<BR>
galactic-scale gravitational effects - which would be observable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  (Keep in mind that if MBrains switch over from stars
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as their primary energy source to thermonuclear reactors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (as R.F. argues strongly), then they can control their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  thought (clock) rate and consume energy at exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that rate that guarantees they run out just when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  next meal is expected to ship in.  (Of course taking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  into account possible disruptions due to pirate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sub-SIs.)
</EM><BR>
<P>That would actually, it seems result in a fairly complex game-theoretic 
<BR>
analysis: How much resources do you devote to &quot;home&quot; computation and how much 
<BR>
do you devote to policing of your mass-gathering activities.  If pirates are 
<BR>
common, you'd want a big navy.
