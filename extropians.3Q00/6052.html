<EM>&gt; We want to change ourselves, to make ourselves richer, smarter, and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And others don't seem terribly excited by this.  Why?  One simple theory
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are afraid of what we would do with such powers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you need a vivid demonstration, try the following question on people
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; know:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;A random person in the world will be chosen, and you get this choice:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) Let them have $X more worth of real resources (such as by telling them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find an oil reserve that would otherwise remain unfound.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) Nothing happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which do you choose?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Caveats:  You don't get to learn who it is before you choose.  They never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it was you that allowed them this benefit.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you let X be a million or more dollars worth, most people will choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They will explain that it could be another Hitler, and they wouldn't want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsible for that.  Which I find pretty amazing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interesting variations:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) How large would X be before you switch to picking nothing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) Let the choice be about whether to give one &quot;wish&quot; (where the standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restrictions apply, e.g., no wishing for more wishes).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) Instead of choosing to increase their wealth, let the choice be about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether to increase their looks, charisma, intelligence, or lifespan.
</EM><BR>
<P>There seems to be a fear of what the person who receives the money would do
<BR>
with it. I wonder if this &quot;fear&quot; disguises a jealousy on the part of the
<BR>
person who chooses?
<BR>
<P>Try this variant:
<BR>
<P>&quot;A random person in the world will be chosen, and you get this choice:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Let them have $X more worth of real resources (such as by telling
<BR>
them where
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to find an oil reserve that would otherwise remain unfound.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Nothing happens.
<BR>
You will also receive $X of new real resources, regardless of the way you
<BR>
choose.
<BR>
<P>Which do you choose?
