<EM>&gt; But from the *physical* point of view nobody (!) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is able  to *explain* those quantum non-locality experiments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or those quantum non-separability experiments, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i.e. the identical behaviour of those entangled particles 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inside those Franson-type interferometers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or the weird quantum-eraser exp., or the ghost interference exp., 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. etc. etc.

<P>It's not clear what an &quot;explanation&quot; would constitute when you are talking
<BR>
about these phenomena.  Usually when we ask &quot;why&quot;, we want an explanation
<BR>
in terms of simpler principles.  But the fundamental workings of QM are
<BR>
the simplest theory that we have today.  Until we come up with a more
<BR>
fundamental theory than QM we can't expect to explain these phenomena
<BR>
other than to say that they fit the theory.
<BR>
<P>As far as explanations for why QM is true, I've seen two directions.
<BR>
One is the anthropic principle.  We see that QM gives us nice chemistry,
<BR>
plenty of common, stable elements each with its own unique chemical
<BR>
and physical properties.  This allows not only for life, but also a
<BR>
diverse and stimulating environment that eventually led to intelligence.
<BR>
The anthropic principle tells us, given that we exist, that we will need
<BR>
some similar blend of stability and diversity.
<BR>
<P>There is also the hope that our universe might turn out to be the
<BR>
*simplest* one possible that leads to life and intelligence.  The universe
<BR>
is described by the laws of physics and the initial conditions.  I find
<BR>
hope in that it seems that the initial state of the universe may have been
<BR>
very simply described.  It was apparently a uniform, hot ball of energy.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From this, along with QM and gravitation, all of the complexity of the
</EM><BR>
universe developed.  The simplicity of the initial conditions lends hope
<BR>
that the combination of initial conditions plus laws of physics may
<BR>
also turn out to be relatively simple, among universes which can give
<BR>
rise to intelligence.  This might give us a philosophical basis to say
<BR>
&quot;why&quot; QM is true.
