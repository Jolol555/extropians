<P>I believe Henderson would have won his bet at the end of last year (when 
<BR>
the bet would have been for). But that's not really the point. Henderson 
<BR>
was making a point about long term trends in prices. And he's absolutely 
<BR>
correct about that. Julian Simon made a longer-term (10 year) bet of this 
<BR>
kind with Paul Ehrlich. 10 years is still quite short term, so when Simon 
<BR>
won he offered to renew the bet with Ehrlich. Ehrlich declined.
<BR>
<P>No, there's no guarantee that new supplies will keep up with demand, but 
<BR>
it's been happening for centuries (with temporary shortages, often caused 
<BR>
by government intervention, or by lack of property right clarification and 
<BR>
enforcement). Since there's no guarantee, let's keep pushing technology in 
<BR>
the direct of faster, cheaper, smaller, and more virtual while applying 
<BR>
market principles to the environment to improve stewardship.
