<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Plainly, you have a much faster computer than I do.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't need a particularly fast computer to run digital evolution software.
<BR>
<P>Check out Tom Ray's Network Tierra experiment at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/pubs/reserves/">http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/pubs/reserves/</A>
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>

<BR>
<P>What
<BR>
This project attempts to use evolution by natural selection in the medium of the
<BR>
digital computer to generate complex and intelligent software.
<BR>
<P>Why
<BR>
Evolution by natural selection has generated complex and intelligent life forms
<BR>
in the medium of carbon chemistry.
<BR>
Evolution is the only process with a proven ability to produce intelligence.
<BR>
The DNA of living organisms is a genetic ``program''. This is a parallel
<BR>
software of a complexity much greater than any that could be written by humans.
<BR>
Experiments illustrated here show that evolution by natural selection works very
<BR>
effectively in the medium of computer machine code.
<BR>
Evolution will find forms and processes that exploit the possibilities inherent
<BR>
in the computational medium.
<BR>
<P>How
<BR>
Self-replicating machine code programs are introduced to the RAM memory of the
<BR>
computer.
<BR>
Genetic variation occurs due to ``mutations'' resulting from random flips
<BR>
(between 0 and 1) of bits in the memory.
<BR>
A ``reaper'' function of the operating system kills old or defective processes
<BR>
in order to make way for newborn programs, once the memory is full.
