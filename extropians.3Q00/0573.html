<P><EM>&gt;The problem is that most of us are not well educated in economics,
</EM><BR>
philosophy and sociology, and that it often doesn't seem they are
<BR>
necessary. After all, the system largely works, doesn't it? We miss the
<BR>
obvious stuff just because it is right under our noses, and concentrate on
<BR>
the rest. But transhumanism is very much about questioning the way things
<BR>
have always been, *all* of the human condition - including how we relate to
<BR>
the current philosophical, political, social and economical systems.&lt;
<BR>
<P>I first learned about and studied transhumanism in the Social Sciences
<BR>
Department at the University of California and it was taught as a social
<BR>
science. The second place transhumanism was lectured was at EZTV Digital
<BR>
Exhibitions. Perhaps we are so smitten with the look and feel of &quot;hard&quot;
<BR>
sciences and technology that we don't think we are discussing social
<BR>
sciences, aesthetics, economics, philosophy, etc.  *All* of the human
<BR>
condition means &quot;all.&quot;  As for economics: why is it a far reach to be
<BR>
knowledgeable about the analysis of the production, distribution, and
<BR>
consumption of transhuman goods and transhumanist services?   Philosophy is
<BR>
discussed each and every time we discuss the extropian principles. I never
<BR>
considered it in intellectually gauche, in bad taste or professionally
<BR>
inappropriate to discuss areas of knowledge where one is not an expert, but
<BR>
does have considerable experience applying information to life by gathering
<BR>
specific knowledge through research, study, observation and common sense.  
<BR>
<P>What lies under our noses and which the author of this piece, as well as
<BR>
Anders missed is how society communicates -- by what methods, language and
<BR>
jargon, symbols and style.  Culture's communication technology are of
<BR>
immeasurable significance to our future and our current relationship with
<BR>
society, and not giving relevance to the enormous impact of literature,
<BR>
music and images (moving or still) on culture and the influences these
<BR>
modes can and do impact on culture, is a loss for transhumanity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I find reading the journal &quot;Futures&quot; valuable, as there I often encounter
</EM><BR>
radically different ideas about what a desirable future would be like.
<BR>
There have been papers discussing how to get *out* of this spiral of
<BR>
technological advancement and into some nice, &quot;more human&quot;, static world -
<BR>
an idea I find abhorrent as stated (because it implies that *everyone* must
<BR>
do it), but is widely accepted in many circles. If we don't learn to deal
<BR>
with the real world issues well from *our* philosophical point of view, the
<BR>
above view might well be what spreads into most economical and political
<BR>
solutions, badly cramping us.&lt;
<BR>
<P>I have used the word &quot;balance&quot; many times.  Balance knowledge, balance
<BR>
experience and balance information so that the scales do not tilt so far in
<BR>
one direction that the an attention deficit results.  While walking around
<BR>
espousing far reaching concepts, our culture must know how to listen to the
<BR>
verse.  What we need is to take a hard look at our culture and determine if
<BR>
&nbsp;it can be a broad-based culturally effective, socially sophisticated point
<BR>
of view including cross-disciplinary knowledge comprised of the most
<BR>
sophisticated sciences, technologies, arts and its communications.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(snip)This is of course great, but it gave me pause to find that in the
</EM><BR>
list of factors most likely to affect the next 1000 years immortality was
<BR>
on the second last place!  Also, note the relative ranking here (I think
<BR>
the index is simply the product of the probability, importance and priority
<BR>
if they occur): (snip) I think the ranking tells us much about general
<BR>
opinions on what is important.&lt;
<BR>
<P>And how did he develop with this list of factors?  I think he deployed
<BR>
creativity. It seems to me that it is practical to emphasize the source of
<BR>
communications and meme breading.  It seems that it is an imbalance and
<BR>
narrow approach to not emphasize how we develop a broader base of reference
<BR>
and knowledge.  In order to create new myths or to crack old ones, there is
<BR>
a need to express and otherwise represent and communicate.
