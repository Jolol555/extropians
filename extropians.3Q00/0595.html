<EM>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20Owning%20as%20cultural%20baggage&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGOEOLFJAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's one issue that is a tangent to the smartness issue, that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to mention.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My career path (passion) is in a field where there are mostly folks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the other gender. It's not something that I can do anything about,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it's not even something I notice. After the third week of working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; homework sets as a freshman with my male classmates, the fellows become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply classmates (or like &quot;brothers&quot;). After 20 years of working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with mostly fellows, it's even less of an issue for me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Kat (my daughter who, incidentally has given me permission to write about
<BR>
her on this list) was just telling me a few days ago that she prefers
<BR>
hanging out with guys rather than girls, because the guys usually do more
<BR>
interesting things--eg. when the kids go to a nearby river, the guys go into
<BR>
the water while the girls tend to sit around on the banks.
<BR>
<P>With a few notable exceptions, such as my cousin Lizzie (do I need to
<BR>
apologize for bringing her up so often?  I'm still grieving over her death
<BR>
and missing her terribly...it was exactly 4 years ago yesterday that she was
<BR>
killed) I've generally preferred to hang out with guys for pretty much the
<BR>
same reason as Kat.  For a long time I denied my womanhood, spoke of other
<BR>
women as &quot;them.&quot;  It's only been in the past 16 years or so, since I became
<BR>
a mother, that I've been able to accept the feminine side of myself. I
<BR>
mentioned the dream of the lioness offline to you, Amara--that dream was a
<BR>
major turning point for me.
<BR>
<P>It began to get very confusing after I and my guy friends reached puberty,
<BR>
and it still is confusing. I often find myself behaving in a cooler manner
<BR>
than I naturally would, because I fear giving the wrong impression.  There
<BR>
have been too many times when I looked into a man's eyes and touched his
<BR>
hand (sometimes even just by accident) and was misunderstood. Such
<BR>
misunderstandings can be awkward at best and can sometimes spoil
<BR>
friendships.
<BR>
<P>I've always had a personal rule never to get romantically involved with
<BR>
people I work with, and I still think it's a good rule.  But for people who
<BR>
spend most of their time at work, it can be a tough one. I think there must
<BR>
be a way that inter-sex relationships could be defined so that they didn't
<BR>
lead to such problems.  But what might that definiation be?  We're all so
<BR>
heavily steeped in our culture that it's hard to see out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've since learned that I can't do very much about other people's fears,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and now looking back, the situation looks silly, (or maybe it's a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; litmus test), but at the time, I know it was difficult for me. And I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonder if I would have had the same kind of insecurities if my partner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked in a female-dominated career field?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ugh!  The whole romantic thing makes me feel yucky.  It's not the only way
<BR>
to go. There's a book, _Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman_ by
<BR>
Marjorie Shostak which is a transcription and English translation of a
<BR>
series of interviews with a middle aged !Kung woman.  This woman laughed in
<BR>
amazement when she was told that in our culture women get angry and jealous
<BR>
of each other over men.  &quot;Men!? They feel jealousy over *men*??&quot;  She
<BR>
couldn't imagine! The glut of romantic comedies and other romantic stuff I
<BR>
see at the video rental store saddens me. Oh!  How I long for something more
<BR>
inspiring!
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Artemis is by far my strongest archetype. It's persisted strongly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the last 25 years. I like my Athena and Aphrodite sides too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though. A four-week-old homeless black kitten arrived out of nowhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on my doorstep this week. Irresistable and adorable. Now my Demeter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side is kicking in.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a large slice of me that's Demeter!  And *ofcourse* Pomona. But Inana
<BR>
always has to come out and howl at the moon from time to time.
<BR>
