<BR>
<EM>&gt; This may be true, but it does not excuse the lack of sloutions proposed in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarian politics. It is one thing to call something wrong, and quite 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another to come up with viable solutions. When I said destructive, I meant 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it. Punk rock was effective at  dismantling music, what it didn't have was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything good to offer in return.  What kids got now is rap - which equals 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crap. That is how I see libertarians. Angry at the system with nothing to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replace it with, so we can just tear it down and see what sprouts. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that is probably how you see it, and as I said it's about
<BR>
180 degrees from reality.  It is the capitalists in the world
<BR>
who have fed, sheltered, and protected the people for decades.
<BR>
It is the capitalists who don't propose solutions--we built them,
<BR>
and are continuing to build them.  The poorest American today
<BR>
is fabulously wealthy compared to 100 years ago, and precisely
<BR>
because 100 years ago his ancestors were left free to build
<BR>
their future and reap the rewards of their efforts.  YOU are the
<BR>
destructive ones, stealing HALF the productivity of the working
<BR>
class and small businessmen and regulating out of business those
<BR>
who would build a better future.
<BR>
<P>We're not as angry at the system--which after all has become
<BR>
freer and more productive and better every year, even though it
<BR>
has a long way to go--as we are angry at ignorant people like
<BR>
you who are trying to destroy all the progress we've made and
<BR>
are trying to make now.  Yes, you are my enemy.  You are fighting
<BR>
against everything that has made the world a better place, and
<BR>
that will make it better in the future, and I do not apologize
<BR>
for pointing that out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Excuse me, but I am not taking any money from you. I work too,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and damn hard.
</EM><BR>
<P>HALF of my productivity is taken from me by force, under
<BR>
laws you support.  You are morally complicit in the acts of
<BR>
laws you support, no less so than if you reached into my
<BR>
pocket on the street.  I can say that I voted against every
<BR>
politician and law that supported evil, like drug laws that
<BR>
imprison 1 million innocent people, and oppressive taxes
<BR>
and regulations that kill the American dream.  I don't
<BR>
think you can say that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have heard this argument over and over and over, ad nauseum. I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet to see any proof that your system provides homeless people with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shelter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why are you assuming that there /is/ a solution?  There may
<BR>
not be.  I can only look at the evidence of my senses and the
<BR>
history of the last century, which shows clearly to me that
<BR>
the freer societies have the fewest poor, the safest streets,
<BR>
and the cleanest environment; and the most controlled societies
<BR>
are miserable, polluted, and oppressive.  My way may not be the
<BR>
ultimate solution, and I don't claim it is.  But it's a hell
<BR>
of a lot better than your way, which is a proven failure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; mainly from the large polupation of mentally ill wandering the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; streets. To say they should just 'get a job' - after you feed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them (???? though you just refused to feed ME, who you have at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least a nodding aquaintance with) when they are unhirable without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intervention, is heartless and also innefective. Nothing is that simple.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is likely that a freer society /would/ intervene more and be
<BR>
more helpful, because more people would be able to help.  I /do/
<BR>
recognize that Rand underestimated the value of blind luck in
<BR>
human success, and that some poor are that way through no fault
<BR>
of their own, and I have said exactly that many times (though
<BR>
you seem not to want to listen to what I actually say, assuming
<BR>
that I'm just a mindless Randroid).  In a libertarian society,
<BR>
where government is separated from geography, I would probably
<BR>
choose a government that did help the unfortunate, and I would
<BR>
choose one that did so efficiently and well.  I would not choose
<BR>
one like the US, that shut down Second Harvest food bank for
<BR>
violating federal minimum wage laws by giving food to people
<BR>
who helped prepare it.  Real compassionate there.  I wouldn't
<BR>
choose one that keeps food and drug prices artificially high
<BR>
with military interdictions and subsidies and patent laws.  I
<BR>
would choose a government that helped the unfortunate because it
<BR>
is a good and compassionate thing to do, not because it is forced
<BR>
on me at gunpoint.
