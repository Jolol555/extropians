<P><EM>&gt; &gt; While it can see how it might take some time to learn how local things work,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think it takes much less time to compile that more abstractly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why would you think that?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think nature is very well compiled as it is.  Nature happened uponneurons
<BR>
as a computational mechanism and used it, even though most of
<BR>
what happens in a neuron is irrelevant to the computation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  And since I tend to think of nanotech as more of a gradual increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; manufacturing abilities, I don't think specifics of nanotech progress matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that much here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nanotech also offers qualitiatively new abilities that can significantly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affect the development of other technologies. Without nanotech you aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to see cheap uploads in this century - the computers will be too slow,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it will take too long to do the optimization research.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with nanotech, ... The relative rates of progress of these different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies all change significantly, which gives you a very different world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure we know much about how nanotech changes the relative rates of
<BR>
progress.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think neural interfaces will be very useful,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Neural interfaces would make truly immersive VR and ER environments possible,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... the fact that an upload has no physical body would no longer constitute a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant limit on its ability to interact with normal humans.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, but these are relatively minor issues compared to the others we are talking
<BR>
about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; and don't think substantial intelligence enhancement is that relevant -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whatever enhancements humans have uploads can use too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...  Does an upload that does a hundred jobs at the same time, some virtual and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some via teleoperated drones, have any particular competitive advantage over an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enhanced 'human' who can do the same things? I would say, only if you don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to pay the upload - and at that point it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be obvious to everyone that you are practicing slavery.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think you understand the economic argument here.  Even ignoring speed
<BR>
advantages of uploads, since it is cheap to create uploads, the supply increases
<BR>
quickly, which lowers the market wage.  I did try to explain this stuff at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sentient AI seems very unlikely to me to happen before uploads, being a vastly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harder problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On what basis do you assume that it is 'vastly harder'? ... Acheiving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animal-level intelligence seems to be a much more tractible problem, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would enable us to build robots good enough to automate almost all physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labor.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nine years of AI research left me with definite impressions.  And we already have
<BR>
very cheap animal intelligence - real animals are cheap, and they come with bodies
<BR>
too.  But very few organizations manage to replace much human labor with animal
<BR>
labor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1) Slave labor is generally not profitable, because of the size of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investment required to ensure that the slaves don't revolt
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't advocate or postulate slave labor. There are lots of possiblearrangments
<BR>
that lead the the same result.  The key point is a vastly
<BR>
increased supply of labor lowering wages.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Creating an upload doesn't just increase the labor supply. It also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increases demand, since the upload will want to spend his wages on something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Upload copying is thus exactly analogous to ordinary population growth - it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just a faster, potentially less costly way of doing the same thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fast population growth is what makes all the difference.  Really.
