<P>
I changed my name to S. O. Terick.
<BR>
<P>What words do you use to describe yourself?
<BR>
I use about 100 words, mostly from philosophy.
<BR>
Thus If I had to use 1 word I would likely say Philosopher describes me 
<BR>
well.
<BR>
I enjoy physics and aesthetics.
<BR>
...and metaphysics
<BR>
...and psychology
<BR>
I'd be a scientist if I was not so closed minded.
<BR>
I can only be sure about things when I'm omniscient.
<BR>
Otherwise, there is a chance the one thing I don't know is the thing that 
<BR>
proves everything wrong.
<BR>
<P>Can someone tell me about the polymath list?
<BR>
<P>Edible Landscaping initiative = food surplus
<BR>
<P>Computers using scanning tunneling microscopes to read xenon atoms on zinc 
<BR>
plate - Eugene?
<BR>
<P>Bionic fat to insulate artificial organs from EM waves - Anders?
<BR>
<P>Can anybody get me a really interesting job I have to travel for? - Anyone?
<BR>
<P>Can some help me find food? I'm hungery; I fast too often.
<BR>
...And I would'nt mind having a home either.
<BR>
I will not work at Burger King;
<BR>
I am a nutritionist and am morally and ethically opposed to supporting the 
<BR>
non-health food industry.
<BR>
I'm a Taoist.
<BR>
I'm poor.
<BR>
...and simple
<BR>
...at least I try to be.
<BR>
...but becoming extropian is quite complicated.
<BR>
...at least for me.
<BR>
<P>If we went from town to town, we could all elect eachother mayors.
<BR>
<P>The Prince of Orange Park
