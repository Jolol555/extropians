<EM>&gt; &gt;Yes, that's true.  Here's the issue, say that I trust anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;borrows my copy not to sell it to anyone, nor to send it to anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;else without destroying the copy.  If I do that, then it is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;honest and legitimate transaction, and as long as it is reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that it is not observed simultaneously, then the copyright has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;been preserved and I can send my friend an mp3 (MPEG I Layer III
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;audio).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Putting on my juror hat (large black cone shaped wizard thing with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starts and planets).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, you may loan it to your friend even as an MP3, You may not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give your friend a copy, it must be loaned with the intention of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; returning it. You may make one copy only, any additional copies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be violations, and yes, copies of a copy are also violations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I still maintain that one can make as many copies as they want, they
<BR>
just can't use more than one at one time, or a copy and the original at
<BR>
one time.
<BR>
<P>I am thinking that there is a right of a purchasor of an album to make a
<BR>
copy for themself.  That might not be the case.  If someone can make a
<BR>
personal private copy they can make as many personal private copies as
<BR>
they want, barring alternative agreement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There is an issue about it being copied, but it appears that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;issue is how many people are listening to it at the same time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Consider, for example, if I had a collection of Savoy Brown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;albums, which perhaps few these days spend much time playing, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;perhaps not, I do not track them.  I might make ten thousand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;copies yet only one or less are listening to a copy at a time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So, it is about the music being freely copied, which is allowed as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we see by the availability of VHS and cassette tape recorders,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;along with the various other forms of audio dubbing, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;satisfactory precedence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So, as long as any number of people make any number of copies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any recorded music that they have purchased and they make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;effort in good faith to ensure that it is not being overplayed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;then they can trade their music.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't agree as I stated above, one copy for personnal use only.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The issue is indeed copying and distribution. It is my current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpretation that existing copyright law permits neither without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permission.

<P>We have yet in this thread to quote any law relating to what is being
<BR>
the ability or right of the purchasor of unlimited play rights in the
<BR>
form of physical media of the album to make copies for any reason.
<BR>
Section 106 of Title 17 specifically says all rights reside with the
<BR>
copyright holder (not artist, copyright holder) and that there are
<BR>
exceptions in the following sections.
<BR>
<P>People do copy their their music for many, various reasons.  One was the
<BR>
convenience of playing a cassette tape in the car.  It is certain that
<BR>
people can copy music that they have purchased for their own uses,
<BR>
otherwise there would not be CD-ROM burners with that in their
<BR>
commercials.
<BR>
<P>Most softwares that are licensed (not purchased) have specific user
<BR>
agreements that allow one backup copy, although rotation of tapes
<BR>
probably leads to unintentional infringement.
<BR>
<P>In regards to Napster, Napster is an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
<BR>
They do appear to be geared towards the distribution of media files many
<BR>
with attached copyright encumbrances, yet they have in good faith
<BR>
removed users upon request, thus in my view satisfying ISP role, and if
<BR>
they are enjoined from operation then so should be IRC, AOL, etc.
<BR>
Whether Napster is a RIAA production is an open question.
