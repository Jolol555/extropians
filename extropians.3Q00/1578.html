[Well I only had this half-written before I was called away from my desk, 
<BR>
and now Greg has responded himself.  But I don't see quite this point made 
<BR>
in Greg's message, so I'll send it even though it's been overtaken by 
<BR>
events.]

<EM>&gt; 2) Colonization by unhappy sub-SIs looking to expand.

<EM>&gt; 3) Colonization choices

<P>Robert, 
<BR>
<P>I think you're missing part of the point Greg was trying to point to from 
<BR>
Robin's paper &quot;Burning the Cosmic Commons&quot;.  If *any* civilizations produce 
<BR>
colonization, then the effects that Robin suggests will come to dominate 
<BR>
the expansion.  If nearly all star systems are inhabited by SIs that 
<BR>
control all the matter at their star, then none of those entities are the 
<BR>
ones who will expand, and you can leave them out of the calculation except 
<BR>
as locations that gobble up probes.
<BR>
<P>Those that send out probes of whatever kind will colonize everything.  The 
<BR>
first wave will be slow and low tech, but it'll be followed by a faster, 
<BR>
higher tech wave, and so it will continue.  Like the pilgrims who came to 
<BR>
America, they'll be cut off from progress, possibly for the lifetimes of 
<BR>
the individuals involved.  But if they have any sense of history, they'll 
<BR>
realize that later generations will be in contact with whatever galactic 
<BR>
civilization ensues.
