<EM>&gt; a face and form that not even a mother could love.  A gargoyle.

<P>I agree with much of Barbara's message about the importance of appearance
<BR>
in our instinctive judge of humanness.  However I don't think that this
<BR>
last suggestion (probably facetious) would work or be appropriate.
<BR>
No one would condone intentionally creating an intelligent being who
<BR>
looked hideous.  I am sure that those who debate these issues would agree
<BR>
unanimously that creating horribly disfigured human clones would be worse,
<BR>
not better, than straightforward cloning.
