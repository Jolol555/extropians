<P><EM> &gt; That the pattern is wrong - that Mitchell Porter and I are both totally
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; off-base and J.R. Molloy is right - is rather less likely.  Imagine you toss
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; back three physicists into the fourteenth century.  Some alchemist spots them
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; arguing and decides to propound his own theory about a world built on five
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; mystical elements.  The physicists may argue with each other, but they share a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; single pattern, and the alchemist doesn't have it - and either you see it or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you don't.

<P>Blah blah blahbLahblaHblAHblahblahbLAHblaHBlahBLAhbLaH.
<BR>
<P>I'm sorry, but instead of answering to technical criticism we've got
<BR>
allusions to Eliezer's and his critic's mental abilities again (with
<BR>
no further evidence but his alleged SAT scores), lots of posts
<BR>
essentially saying &quot;You no good. How dare you question my vast mental
<BR>
powers! I will show you, eventually. Etc.&quot;
<BR>
<P>You know, this also makes a pattern, and I don't like it. Yakking
<BR>
about the Big Cool Thing(tm) instead of doing it is sure more fun
<BR>
(been guilty of it myself), but this doesn't get the BCT done. It
<BR>
kinda makes one wonder whether there is anything behind that BCT thing
<BR>
at all, instead of Potyemkin's villages all the way down.
<BR>
<P>Show us the money. I would be really thrilled if you'd vanish for a
<BR>
few months, or a year, and come back with with something solid,
<BR>
something which would make VCs want to write out fat checks
<BR>
reflexively.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, I'll stop commenting on this thread, because you're not
<BR>
willing to argument at the technical level, and hence I consider this
<BR>
a waste of mine and other people's time.
