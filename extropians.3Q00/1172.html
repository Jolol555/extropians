Robert J. Bradbury &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20upload%20only%20small%20part&In-Reply-To=&lt;200007141731.LAA23544@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (I agree that Brent is rapidly skipping from Robin's &quot;simple&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploads to full sensory interleaving without a huge amount of work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on exactly how this would be accomplished.  IMO, that is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *really* hard part -- mapping individual neural nets onto a common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience message exchange format.)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is intentional.  Sure, complete consciousness sharing is
<BR>
the *really* hard part, but this isn't what I'm talking about.  I'm
<BR>
talking about something much simpler than this.  I think our visual
<BR>
awareness system is much simpler than all that.  I think once we have
<BR>
the tools to understand how we are visually aware of things, then
<BR>
we'll be able to make more progress at understanding how we know what
<BR>
our thoughts are made of.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary visual cortex is what holds our conscious
<BR>
knowledge of what we wee.  It's what produced the color qulia which
<BR>
our visual awareness is made of.  Once we discover how and why our
<BR>
visual cortex produces about 100 degrees of visual awareness centered
<BR>
around the direction our eyes are pointing, it can't be that hard to
<BR>
augment that system and to increase it to say 200 degrees of visual
<BR>
awareness of what is around us with the input from additional
<BR>
artificial visual eyes, or wider field of vision replacement eyes and
<BR>
augmented optic nerves...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can't be that much more difficult, after things like that,
<BR>
to engineer a more independent visual cortex that is integrated into
<BR>
the same conscious visual awareness space, that works based on the
<BR>
input from an entirely different set of eyes, like say those of your
<BR>
spouse, when she desires to give you access to the data her eyes are
<BR>
picking up.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, this is going to take lots of advancement and
<BR>
understanding before we can do any of this.  But how can we not be
<BR>
able to do any of this if we can do &quot;simple&quot; uploads, at least
<BR>
conscious ones that use the same qualia the original used to represent
<BR>
its conscious knowledge.
<BR>
