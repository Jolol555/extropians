<P><EM>&gt; Suppose we don't have a libertarian or private-law world as we move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forward.  Can the modern liberal democracy work in a transhuman world?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How would we deal with the tremendous potential increase in diversity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a corresponding spread in ability levels?  ...  How do those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cherish the equalizing efforts of western governments propose to address
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these changes?
</EM><BR>
<P>When evolution adds substantial new functionality, it seems to prefer to add
<BR>
on new modules rather than radically change old ones.  As brains got smarter
<BR>
new brain systems were wrapped around the old ones.  When we got culture,
<BR>
brains stayed pretty much the same while culture evolved.  In the evolution of
<BR>
social systems, we have retained much of our old social systems, including
<BR>
clans, religions, and kings.  We didn't get rid of kings right off - rather we
<BR>
added on democratic systems and slowly gave them more powers.  Radical
<BR>
revolutions were the exception, not the rule.
<BR>
<P>Democratic political systems are deeply embedded in our society, and change
<BR>
relatively slowly.  So if a fast changing world of AIs, uploads, etc. evolves,
<BR>
we might just leave existing political systems in tact and add on new systems
<BR>
capable of changing more rapidly to respond to circumstances.
<BR>
<P>For example, meat humans might be the only ones that count for democracy, but
<BR>
more and more autonomy might be granted to corporations or other organizations
<BR>
within which AIs and uploads deal with each other.   If those organizations
<BR>
are what more and more drive the economy, the slower democracy of meat humans
<BR>
would wisely back off.
<BR>
<P>Another possibility is giving votes in proportion to wealth.  Sweden actually
<BR>
once had a house where votes were counted that way.  Less egalitarian perhaps,
<BR>
but more robust to diversity.
<BR>
<P>I also propose futarchy (<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html</A>) as a way to
<BR>
allow democratic style governments to adapt much more quickly to a changing
<BR>
world.
