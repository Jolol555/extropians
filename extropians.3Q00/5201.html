<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I guess that talking about God at this level is a matter of aesthetics. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  find it faintly distasteful to refer to my inspiration as coming from God;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  like eating burnt soup.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, hopefully you and I don't need to create a construct, or symbolic 
<BR>
metaphor, for where our &quot;flow&quot; or &quot;energy&quot; comes from. We exist quite 
<BR>
harmoniously with the idea of *ourselves* being the &quot;source&quot; of that 
<BR>
inspiration, or if you prefer, a &quot;manifestation&quot; or a &quot;piece&quot; of energy and 
<BR>
need no &quot;purpose&quot; higher than that!  We don't *want* to be guided by some 
<BR>
outer mysterious power. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I don't think there's any supernatural element to the inspiration/creative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  bits of the thought processes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but if we are intelligent and connected, we must also live within the 
<BR>
realization that we are a part of a huge temporal network of beings and 
<BR>
things that we *cannot* influence and yet upon which our life's direction 
<BR>
depends. We can choose to see that as a &quot;larger picture&quot; or a tapestry, or 
<BR>
some other metaphor. If we are an intelligent mind, we want to harmonize with 
<BR>
that world, in order to make our own experience here more pleasing, 
<BR>
productive, whatever.
<BR>
&quot;God&quot; becomes various symbols for describing that larger picture.
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt;Just nonlinear wet stuff, slapping together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  weird, disconnected ideas in weird, difficult to fathom ways, such that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  can't explain the derivation to any useful degree.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. We have these impulses, conflicting energies - wet stuff slapping 
<BR>
together, our organs (the brain being one of them) demanding different 
<BR>
things! How would early man explain these urges?
<BR>
<P>My point was merely to say that &quot;god&quot; did/does exist in the minds of millions 
<BR>
and millions of people - and to the extent that the belief influenced *them* 
<BR>
- so are you influenced by this experience.  When the philosophers of Greece, 
<BR>
India, Japan, and the Old World created the languages you speak, the very 
<BR>
reality you live in, that logic you adore, the life you live ... they did so 
<BR>
*believing* that something guided them. Zen, Christian, Grecian, Hindu.. 
<BR>
Depending on what myths are in play, there's a very REAL volition involved. 
<BR>
How you perceive these myths clearly involves &quot;doing things&quot;.
<BR>
<P>God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. It is an idea that (getting 
<BR>
back to the original &quot;overactive god module&quot; idea of WONDER -- awe,  
<BR>
transcendence, beauty, expansion and bliss) *seeks* to describe an essential 
<BR>
experiential part of human consciousness that can't really be put into words. 
<BR>
Religion is a language (like poetry) that opens up that discussion. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; When your brain comes up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with something out of left field, the only derivation for which would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  some kind of neural trace showing neuron firings in painful detail, from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  some distant past up to now, well, just forget the explanation. Just think,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  instead, &quot;aha!&quot;. A bolt from the blue; it's really a bolt from the grey.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is really not the issue. Where inspiration comes from is really moot.
<BR>
<P>What is useful is to accept what *is*. It is not realistic to deny that 
<BR>
god(s) (though clearly not a reality) exert real influence you. Even if that 
<BR>
influence is unwitting. It does not require your knowledge of god's existence 
<BR>
(or your knowledge of it's nonexistence) to make this true. Since it is a 
<BR>
construct, an idea, it certainly does not require any of the *gods' * to be 
<BR>
real in order for it to make changes and resonances on the physical plane.
<BR>
<P>As I said, those ideas - based on symbolic fiction - became real events and 
<BR>
actions.
<BR>
If that god was a crude &quot;idea of what cannot be comprehended&quot;, crude events 
<BR>
and actions followed. If it was a refined one, then more aesthetics and 
<BR>
refined emotions are involved.
