The point I'm trying to make is obvious, I think. The utility of concealed
<BR>
weapons is all in psychological benefits for the carrier, not in actually
<BR>
being able to defend yourself; in most possible confrontations you're
<BR>
probably safer keeping your gun in your pocket. That said, in Greg's
<BR>
situation where you've (maybe) got nasty people who intend to kill you
<BR>
rather than rob you, a gun's probably a good thing, although a good pair of
<BR>
Nikes might be an even better (or at least complementary) investment.
<BR>
<P>I've got to admit to some hypocrisy again in this discussion; most places I
<BR>
go I wear steel capped boots which complement some years of Tae Kwon Do;
<BR>
amounts to a concealed weapon in reality, especially where there are few
<BR>
guns. But hey, it's a style thing, really. Just like the fact that I shave
<BR>
my head has nothing to do with encroaching pattern baldness.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Here's one for the testosterone fueled... Of you guys that actually

carry
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  guns, how many of you have ever had to use them in any kind of

self-defense
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  situation? I realise the dead guys can't put their hands up, so we'll

have

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Never, not even close, although once when I was handling a case that
</EM><BR>
involved
<BR>
<EM>&gt; some rather unsavory characters implicated in some fairly nasty business,
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thought it a real possibility.  But bear in mind Spike's comment about my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size compared to the average wookie.  Perhaps people just choose not to
</EM><BR>
mess
<BR>
<EM>&gt; with me for other reasons ... too scary-looking ...
