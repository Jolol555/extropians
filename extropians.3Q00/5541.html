<P>I agree with you. I can and do work smoothly with my like-minded,
<BR>
possibly-armed fellows. Doesn't distress me in the slightest as long as
<BR>
there is rough parity and roughly shared values.
<BR>
<P>SWAT teams breaking down the wrong door and shooting the wrong person?
<BR>
That distresses me.

<P>Some unfortunate deprived soul shotgunning four grad students at a
<BR>
McDonald's because one of them said &quot;you gotta be kidding me!&quot; after he
<BR>
said &quot;give me some money NOW&quot;? That distresses me.

<P>&quot;When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? .... And
<BR>
maddest of all...to see life as it *is* and not as it *should be*!&quot; --
