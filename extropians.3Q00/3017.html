In the current issue of Science there is an article by Ban et al that reports the 3D atomic
<BR>
scale structure of the most complex object ever, the largest of the two subunits of a
<BR>
ribosome. This thing is huge, 2.6  million daltons,  more than 50 times as big as your
<BR>
average protein. It has 3,000 nucleotides of RNA bent into a complex shape folded in
<BR>
out and around 31 different interlocking proteins. I find this really interesting at a lot of
<BR>
different levels. It's amazing they can find the 3D shape of something this big and complex.
<BR>
The object itself is very important, ribosomes are where proteins are made. There are
<BR>
practical implications, the ribosomes in bacteria are major target for antibiotics.
<BR>
There are philosophical implications too.
<BR>
<P>Two-thirds of the mass of ribosome's comes from RNA, and it turns out that the RNA
<BR>
is the catalyst for the protein synthesis, not the one third that is protein as you might
<BR>
expect, the protein acts just as girders to hold the machine together. RNA can not only
<BR>
store information like DNA it can also catalyze chemical reactions like proteins. RNA
<BR>
acting as a enzyme had been noticed before but never at something this important or
<BR>
fundamental to all life. It give support to the theory that when life first originated 4 billion
<BR>
years ago it contained no DNA and no protein, just pure RNA.
