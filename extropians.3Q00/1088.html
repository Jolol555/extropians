<EM> &gt; It seems far from clear to me that it is trivial to take a design for a

<EM> &gt; bridge, throw some nanodust at it and say &quot;Build it for me over there.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Assembly and construction use intelligence, just as design does.

<EM>&gt;Hmmmm, if that is true, then how do we measure the IQ of a bacteria?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Self-assembly can be done quite simply by throwing the parts in a heap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and shaking or stirring until the desired result is obtained.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tough nut is to design the pieces so they can effectively self-assemble.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That is generally not how macro-scale design is currently done.

<EM>&gt;I've never constructed anything more complex than a dog house, but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is true that most construction projects are challenging, even with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;design that looks good on paper.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However I think the reasons are mostly due to imperfections in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;environment where the constructed object has to fit in, imperfections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the building materials, and imperfections in my construction technique.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With nanotech we might be able to eliminate the last two sources of error.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If all parts are perfect and all assembly steps are done with atomic scale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;precision, there should be no need for intelligence.  Parts are attached
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or detached by rote, with a check to see if it went right, and (perhaps)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discarded if there was a flaw.  This would not take much intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think what you are both saying is that you can substitute between assembly
<BR>
intelligence and design intelligence and assembly control/conditions.   Yes,
<BR>
this is true, at least to some degree.  But that doesn't mean it will be on
<BR>
net cheaper to do such substitution, and it doesn't say how far you can
<BR>
reasonably go in that direction.
