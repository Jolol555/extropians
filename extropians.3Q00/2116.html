Oh, I agree that everyone on the list is quite familiar with these themes,
<BR>
but friends of list members that might be dragged along to see this movie
<BR>
may not be.  When I first saw the movie I was with a large group of
<BR>
friends, all but one of which had seen the movie.  The guy who had not
<BR>
seen it was highly confused and it was fairly obvious that his confusion
<BR>
was due to a lack of experience of cyberpunk.
<BR>
<P>Neuromancer is a better introduction in large part because it is a book.
<BR>
Gibson could take more time to explain all of the stranger things that
<BR>
appeared in his world.  Also, Neuromancer includes brain upgrades and
<BR>
autonomous AI which is why I chose it over Snowcrash.
