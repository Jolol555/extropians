<P><EM>    &gt;their must be a better way that does not involve government intervention.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, there's private charity. It's true that if nobody cares about the poor they
<BR>
won't get anything, but in that case how would government help? If people won't
<BR>
give money voluntarily why will they vote for politicians who make them?
<BR>
<P>I admit to being a little intrigued by your insistence that there must be a &quot;better way&quot;
<BR>
to get people to treat their fellows better. I can only think of 3 ways to get anybody
<BR>
to do anything, force, love, or trade; government uses the first, extropians tend to
<BR>
like the last two better, if you can think of a fourth I'd love to hear it.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;So as Michael Lorrey said, &quot;don't fix something that ain't broke&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;Well, the current system we have is obviously broken,
</EM><BR>
<P>Right now, more people are richer, healthier, and better educated than in any
<BR>
other time in human history. Right now the market is a stronger force than in
<BR>
any other time in human history. Coincidence? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;There is a saying, &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof&quot;.  The claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;of free-marketers is that they will do a better job at handling civil liberties
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;issues.  Well, I'm still waiting.....
</EM><BR>
<P>Then wait no longer. Shoving 6 million people into ovens is pretty extraordinary but
<BR>
the free market didn't do that, a government did that. Forcing productive farmers off
<BR>
their land to make huge corrupt poorly run collective farms leading to the starvation
<BR>
death of at least 20 million is pretty extraordinary but the free market didn't do that,
<BR>
a government did that. Forcing hundreds of thousands of teenagers, who were too
<BR>
young to vote, to fight and often die in a pointless war 12 thousand miles from their
<BR>
home is pretty extraordinary but the free market didn't do that, a government did that.
<BR>
<P>Not that corporations are perfect of course, they can be rude to their customers and
<BR>
sometimes they even make bad tires, but it's not quite the same thing is it.
