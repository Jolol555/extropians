<EM>&gt; &gt; FRY/Serbia is not a NATO member.  NATO is a defensive alliance.
</EM><BR>
Originally,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it was only intended to last about a decade, and then was mainly as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; counter to potential Soviet invasion of Western Europe.  Yugoslavia was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; never a member of this alliance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yet it is surrounded by NATO members, who have wound up paying the cost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the refugee problem created by Serbia's racist policies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Four problems with statement.  One, almost all if Serbia's neighbors are not
<BR>
NATO members -- Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia,
<BR>
Romania.  The only NATO member next door to Serbia is Hungary and that's
<BR>
only an associate member.  (Note also that Macedonia gave a cold shoulder to
<BR>
Kosovar refugees.)
<BR>
<P>Two, the Kosovar refugee problem starting only after the bombs began
<BR>
dropping.  Recall, the &quot;genocide&quot; that took place in Kosovo totalled under
<BR>
60 deaths.  Granted, any death is bad, but this hardly smacks of genocide
<BR>
and looks more like what the Serbians originally said, viz.,
<BR>
counter-terrorism and police operations.  (If you disagree, then remember
<BR>
three things.  First, Serbia, then and now, had the military might to kill a
<BR>
lot more people.  Second, why weren't there huge refugee movements before
<BR>
the bombing began.  Did the Kosovar Albanians only decide to start fleeing
<BR>
when the bombs started to drop?  Third, where is the evidence for
<BR>
pre-bombing mass graves in Kosovo?)
<BR>
<P>Posen, in &quot;The War for Kosovo: Serbia's Political-Military Strategy&quot;
<BR>
(_International Security_ 24(4)), thinks the refugee problem during the war
<BR>
might have been an attempt by Serbia to stop the war.  How?  By sending
<BR>
refugees to neighboring countries, it might have been thought, this would
<BR>
make it seem like the war would cause more problems than otherwise for NATO.
<BR>
If that was the plan, it did not work as, except for NATO bombing refugees
<BR>
and getting flack for that, it only made Serbia look worse in world opinion
<BR>
AND also made it less likely that NATO bombs would fall on Kosovar
<BR>
Albanians.
<BR>
<P>Third, refugees really only become a problem because of statist policies.
<BR>
If one does not force people to pay for refugees, but allows private aid to
<BR>
them, then they do not become an externality.  It's only the welfare-statist
<BR>
who can see them as a problem.
<BR>
<P>Four, some of Serbia's neighbors are basically racist -- using &quot;racist&quot; to
<BR>
cover all forms of militant ethnocentrism here -- such as Croatia and
<BR>
Macedonia.  The Croatian leadership has have proven time and again, through
<BR>
both internal policy and external war (in Bosnia) to be so.  Macedonia is
<BR>
mainly interested in keeping itself Macedonian, one reason why its
<BR>
government gave Kosovar Albanians the cold shoulder.
<BR>
<P>The Balkans and most of the world for that matter is not antiracist.  In
<BR>
fact, the lesson of the post-Cold War era seems to be that a lot of peoples
<BR>
just barely got along and that the general tendency is, sadly, for
<BR>
ethnically pure realms, whether that be in the Balkans, Germany (which has
<BR>
its racist problems against Turkish immigrants), the Russian &quot;near abroad&quot;
<BR>
(former Soviet Republics which have large ethnically Russian populations),
<BR>
Canada (not just Quebec, but also Native Americans), Nigeria, Rwanda, or
<BR>
Indonesia.  Serbia is merely the nation that's been singled out, while a lot
<BR>
of U.S. allies (Indonesia, Turkey, Nigeria) get a free pass.  (Surely, you
<BR>
can bring up counterexamples, but how many of them are neighbors of Serbia?
<BR>
How many of them are there compared with the rest of the world's nations?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this unconsented imposition of externalities, Serbia brought NATO on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; An aggressor nation is generally defined as one that attacks other
</EM><BR>
nations.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since Kosovo was (and de jure still is) part of FRY, this claim falls
</EM><BR>
flat.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, before the war began, it's still arguable whether the aggression
</EM><BR>
was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more than counter-terrorist operations.  (Arguable, though not certain.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Serbia had, at that point, established a consistent record of backing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supporting, and committing genocide, ethnic cleansing, and all around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general anti-democratic gestapo tactics in violation even of its own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws.
</EM><BR>
<P>In Kosovo, there is no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing prior to the
<BR>
NATO air campaign.  In fact, the death toll was extremely small and limited
<BR>
to areas where the KLA operated.  That sort of makes it look like, in this
<BR>
case, Serbia was not doing all the things you say it was.  (This does not
<BR>
excuse other cases, of course, but it does make me want to look more closely
<BR>
at them.  Are you going to accept the U.S. State Department's view of
<BR>
everything here?  According to them, the U.S. and its allies are always in
<BR>
the right and every war they fight is a just war.  Do you agree?)
<BR>
<P>Also, if you are really against this sort of thing, then when will call for
<BR>
the bombing of Croatia, which has a similar record of genocide and ethnic
<BR>
cleansing, especially of Serbs?  It was also deeply involved in Bosnia at
<BR>
one point.  And it's record of doing this dates back to World War Two.
<BR>
(That said, I'm not for bombing Croatia.  Too many innocents, again, would
<BR>
be killed or harmed and the policy changes probably wouldn't come about.
<BR>
Serbia today is no better as a country for the bombings -- in terms of its
<BR>
government's policies.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While it is arguable that the KLA received backing from underworld
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figures in Albania, that is really irrelevant. The ethnic Albanians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raised and living in Kosovo had been under an organized campaign of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prejudice, segregation, oppression and persecution ever since Milosevic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; took power in the 80's and made his famous speech in Kosovo that he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would take back Kosovo for the Serbians. Given such a high level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approval for anti-albanian activities by serbs in kosovo, it is only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; natural that albanians would turn to their countrymen for support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against such persecution.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't completely disagree with this picture of the origin of the KLA,
<BR>
though the KLA itself seemed more interested before, during, and after the
<BR>
war with obtaining power than liberating Albanians living in Kosovo.  (Maybe
<BR>
this is the way it is with most paramilitary groups.)  Also, there was an
<BR>
Albanian President of Kosovo, but he was marginalized by the KLA -- because
<BR>
he was not pushing for independence and also because he sought change
<BR>
through democratic means.  (These were the reasons given, in my
<BR>
recollection, in TV and radio news before and during the war.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Terrorists are only terrorists to those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wish to wipe them out and those who buy into the propaganda of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opressors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Debatable.  I suppose what you mean is not against those who wish to wipe
<BR>
out the terrorist group, but the larger group the terrorists claim to
<BR>
represent or protect.  That said, terrorism has no valid justification.
<BR>
True, in some cases, the label &quot;terrorist&quot; is used against anyone who uses
<BR>
force against the government, but general terrorist tactics are to attack
<BR>
noncombatants, such as when a bazaar is bombed in Jerusalem.  Innocents are
<BR>
killed.
<BR>
<P>Whether the KLA was doing that in Kosovo is another story.  I'm not sure and
<BR>
I bet you don't know either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As has been learned in Ireland, Isreal, and elsewhere, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easiest and least bloody way to deal with terrorists is to try to remove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the reasons why terrorists engender support. Now, terrorists are called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terrorist because they attack and engeder fear in a civilian population.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The KLA never attacked civilians prior to the NATO action, they focused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only on government police, soldiers, and politicians. These are not acts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of terrorists, but of guerrillas fighting an insurgency war. The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who committed terrorist acts against civilians in Kosovo were the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Serbs.
</EM><BR>
<P>But when?  During the war, yes.  However, a lot of that was probably because
<BR>
the Serbian army then was openly fighting the KLA and attacking towns and
<BR>
villages with impunity.  Before the war, the story looks very different.  If
<BR>
not, where's your evidence?  Where are the pre-war mass graves, the prewar r
<BR>
efugees?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The cooperation was limited to accepting the agreement or being bombed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That's not much more than pure coercion.  Notably, neither the Kosovar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Albanians nor the FRY had input into the drafting of the agreement.
</EM><BR>
This
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was &quot;take it or leave it&quot; diplomacy.  (You might argue that the Serbian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government deserves no better, but the cost of such a stance is not only
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; effort spent bombing, but also innocents being killed, both Serbian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Albanian, etc.  Also, one might ask, did American negotiators really
</EM><BR>
want an
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; agreement all sides could agree to that would protect Kosovar Albanians
</EM><BR>
AND
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; address Serbian concerns about the KLA or was the goal to push Serbia
</EM><BR>
into a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corner then bomb?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a good question to ask, especially its being so concurrent with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the scandals that Clinton was going through at the time. However, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my opinion that while Clinton definitely had an interest in deflecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention away from himself, there was a just and real reason to go into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kosovo. If I were a NATO peacekeeper, I can tell you I would not go in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unless I had AT LEAST the sort of conditions set forth in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ramboulliet agreement.
</EM><BR>
<P>The actual agreement in force is not the same as the original Rambouillet
<BR>
Agreement.  In fact, the notorious Appendix B has been changed.  The
<BR>
occupation force is limited to Kosovo and does not have a free reign in the
<BR>
rest of FRY.  Also, the timetable for an independence vote has been removed
<BR>
and the operation is under UN Security Council control.  In other words,
<BR>
Serbia held out for something and they did win some concessions, though at
<BR>
great cost.
<BR>
<P>[For those who want to see the original agreement, it's at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html">http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html</A>]
<BR>
<P>Most likely Milosevic would not be able to remain in power if the original
<BR>
Appendix B was left in, agreed to, and enforced.  I don't mean NATO would
<BR>
have overthrown him.  Instead, his support would have dried up and his
<BR>
opposition gotten stronger.  Don't forget, Serbia is not Iraq.  Milosevic
<BR>
still has to justify himself to parliament and the populace.  He still has
<BR>
to keep his coalition happy -- or, at least, not unhappy enough to stop
<BR>
supporting him.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Also, some of this is expected behavior.  Secessions on the whole are
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tolerated by whatever they are seceding from.  Note the cases of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; American Colonies seceding from Great Britain, the CSA seceding from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; USA, East Timor seceding from Indonesia, Chechnya seceding from Russia,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Kurds attempting to seceded from Turkey, Iraq, and Iran.  In all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; these cases, violent methods were used to suppress the rebellions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This does not make such suppression good or right, but it's considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; natural behavior for nation states.  Ones that can't or won't do that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; generally, do not continue to exist for long.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is clearely unsupportable in the current day, given the excellent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example of Czhechoslovakia breaking up quite peacefully into Slovakia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the Czhech Republic. The Soviet Union also broke up rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peacefully, surprise surprise. I personally expected that to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bloodbath.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too.
<BR>
<P>But it only supports my claim above.  Nation states that do not suppress
<BR>
secession cease to be.  The Soviet Union ceased to be.  Czechoslovakia
<BR>
ceased to be.  If you're a nation state and you don't force parts of you to
<BR>
stick together, then, in general, they will leave as soon as the level of
<BR>
comfort declines enough.
<BR>
<P>And don't take my comments the wrong way.  I'm not for suppression.  I'm
<BR>
just making an observation.  Note also that my comments cover your examples,
<BR>
while yours do not cover mine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then you've also got Canada going through the process of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breaking off Nunavut at the present moment, with scarcely a ripple that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have not heard anything about it in the news in months, and most of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rest of english speaking Canada secretly wishes that Quebec would go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ahead and secede, just so they can get that damn welfare case off their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backs. You've also got Britain slowly going through the motions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breaking up so peacefully and politely hardly anyone has a bad thing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say about it. The Scots and Welsh are so  damn happy to have their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parliaments now they sure as hell can't say anything bad about London.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hell, the Scots got their stone back too.
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.  Don't get me wrong.  It's good to see it happening.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not trying to make Milosevic or the Serb government look like
</EM><BR>
victims
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here.  My goal is merely to give more evidence in this discussion.  I'm
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pro-Serb or pro-Milosevic.  At the same time, I do think the US and NATO
</EM><BR>
got
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; involved in a basically counterproductive war where many innocents
</EM><BR>
suffered.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Many more Albanians and Serbians died during the war.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think you can make any sort of representations over how many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; died versus how many WOULD HAVE DIED if Milosevic and his Tigers had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been allowed a free reign to commit widespread genocide across Kosovo. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personally think that despite the number who died, more would have died
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if we had not gone in, and those that woud have died would have all been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Albanians, while at least this way the Serbian civilians that have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approved all this bullshit have finally had to pay some price for their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bigotry.
</EM><BR>
<P>That posits that Serbs who died or otherwise paid as well as others who died
<BR>
or otherwise paid for this deserve that.  Since to an outsider it appears
<BR>
you've done nothing material, so far as I know, to revolt against the U.S.
<BR>
government for, say, its various unjust policies, from its war on drugs to
<BR>
its support of genocidal leaders in Turkey, Indonesia, throughout Latin
<BR>
America and Africa, would it be all right if you were killed?  After all,
<BR>
shouldn't you be made to pay the price for American policies?  (I disagree,
<BR>
of course.  And by no means do I imply any subject or citizen of a nation
<BR>
state should be held responsible for his or her governments actions --
<BR>
unless he or she is part of that government.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I think NATO member populations were propagandized into accepting the
</EM><BR>
war.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Surely, Milosevic and the Serbian government are not nice, good, just,
</EM><BR>
etc.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But, at the same time, there are much worse problems in the world
</EM><BR>
(Turkish
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; treatment of Kurds being perhaps the most glaring one, since Turkey is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; NATO member and a US client state) and I feel this was more Monica's War
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than anything else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Turkish repression of Kurds is likely to remain on the back burner until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the problems of Isreal/Palestine and Iraq are resolved. The Turkish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are getting more and more fundamentalist, and it may become more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a problem in the next several years, however I am hoping that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuing moderation of Iran will decrease the support for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamentalist groups around the arab world.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some think Turkey might be the next Iran.  However, if bombing works so
<BR>
well, why not bomb Turkey?  Why let the Turkish government continue its
<BR>
brutal repression of the Kurdish people.  You appear to have a ho hum
<BR>
attitude here.  Kurds are dying and the U.S. government even gives money and
<BR>
weapons to their killers.  The Serbs are different, right?  Why?  (This is
<BR>
strange, since Turkey is the product of the Ottoman Empire disintegrating,
<BR>
which also set the chessboard for the Balkans and the Middle East in the
<BR>
20th century.  _The Peace to End All Peace_, as one fine book on the subject
<BR>
is titled!)
<BR>
<P>In other words, when does your &quot;just and real reason&quot; to intervene
<BR>
militarily come into affect?  It appears from the way you're applying this
<BR>
notion, you're only using it to justify stuff ad hoc and after the fact.
<BR>
Would you be clear about when it's okay to use force and when it's not in
<BR>
these cases and why?
<BR>
<P>But back to more constructive stuff here, how can we minimize the influence
<BR>
of bad elements here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But to be more constructive here: how would Extropians in general deal
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; such problems?  One would hope our bright technological future would
</EM><BR>
make
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ethnic rivalries less a problem, yet the 1990s seemed like a time when
</EM><BR>
both
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technology progressed and ethnic rivalries and even wars increased.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Governments and multinational corps have used advancing technologies to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to make the world a smaller place. They need to realize that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffer from the same psychological pressures you see in the rat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiment, and when there is the perception that people are closer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; together and there is pressure for conformity, there will be increased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pressure by individuals to push people farther apart and be unique. We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all have to have our own space, our comfort zone. We are not domestic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animals.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think humans are a bit different than rats, else every major metropolitan
<BR>
area would explode in violence.  We don't see that, especially with the very
<BR>
low violent crime rates in many large US cities, such as NYC.  New Jersey is
<BR>
also the most densely populated US State, e.g., yet the level of violence is
<BR>
extremely low compared to the Balkans.  Of course, maybe your qualifying
<BR>
factors are intervening in these cases.  How would you account for it?
<BR>
<P>And some might call a lot of this technology is what Bruce Sterling dubbed
<BR>
&quot;enforcement technology&quot; -- i.e., stuff that makes it easier to divide and
<BR>
conquer, then unite and rule -- not necessarily liberating technology.  (Of
<BR>
course, I'd disagree because I believe the user decides whether to use a
<BR>
computer to, say, hold a discussion like this one or to put a database of
<BR>
undesireables in it.)
<BR>
<P>We should probably split this into two threads.  A strictly Kosovo one and
<BR>
another devoted to what we should do in general.  Perhaps if anyone else
<BR>
decides to chime in.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
