<EM>&gt; In the August &quot;Nature Medicine&quot; is an article by Gary J Nabel, it demonstrates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the extraordinary lethality of the Ebola virus is caused by a certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glycoprotein produced by the virus. The really interesting thing is the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he did it, he removed the Ebola gene for this glycoprotein and used genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering to insert it into the virus that causes the common cold. Intact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human blood vessels were then exposed to this modified cold virus. Within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 48 hours this former virus milquetoast caused the human tissue to turn into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stinky gunkey sludge just like mighty Ebola itself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't heard any protests from the anti genetics people, I guess they're too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; busy protecting the world from killer tomatoes, but I got to tell you this scares
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hell out of me. I'm sure they took elaborate precautions to prevent this thing from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting out,  but holly shit! Imagine a virus that's airborn and as contagious as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common cold, that has no vaccine or any other treatment, and kills 90% of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infected in less than 48 hours in a manner gruesome enough for any horror movie.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I sure hope there is something about this experiment I don't understand.
</EM><BR>
<P>OUtside of the fact that he violated a number of international laws against
<BR>
research into biological weapons? I'm surprised nobody has charged him with
<BR>
crimes against humanity yet. I would not be surprised if this guy doesn't take a
<BR>
long, secret, sabbatical someplace where there are nice BIG locks on the doors,
<BR>
and guys in black uniforms with nice big guns guarding the place. I sure as hell
<BR>
hope he did not publish his technique or identify the gene responsible.
