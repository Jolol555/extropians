<EM>&gt; &gt; Truth is, I dont read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nearly as many books now as I did in my misspent youth.  Now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in my misspent adulthood, the internet has taken the place of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lot of that, not just the lists, but web surfing, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately I find this to be true as well.  Surfing the net and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading mailing lists is relaxing and entertaining, mental fast-food
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared to the nourishing meal of a good book.  Maybe we need to go on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an intellectual &quot;diet&quot; occasionally, get some good nutrition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>I read many more books now than I used to and surf like mad also.  Some
<BR>
say 
<BR>
I should &quot;get a life&quot;.  But I have one, thank you very much.  I read a
<BR>
lot on and off line.  It is a toss-up where I read the most effectively
<BR>
and rapidly. Getting a really good laptop and a good LCD monitor as my
<BR>
main desktop monitor helped a lot.  The only gripe I have is that I
<BR>
don't have a PAD that I can easily carry around the house with me. 
<BR>
Hmmm.  Put it on the list of things to build or buy.  Also it is a bit
<BR>
harder on conventional screens to use hand motion speed reading
<BR>
techniques.  I find my average reading speed goes down a bit online. But
<BR>
I find ways to compensate like narrowing the width of the window (where
<BR>
that works) so I can quickly scan down columns without shifting my eyes
<BR>
sideways.
