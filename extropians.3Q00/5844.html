<P><EM>&gt; Further difficulties lie in the fact that the AI is not homogenous,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it has radiated after nucleation. It's name is Legion, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're all of vastly differing complexities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, they *shall* be of vastly differing complexities... when they do actually
<BR>
emerge.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, we can use the fact that the AI is not homogenous to choose the most
<BR>
friendly of the bunch as replicators or parents of future generations of AI.
<BR>
This will, of course, insure that they remain friendly.
<BR>
<P>Friendlies magnify friendliness by terminating unfriendlies.

<BR>
<P>&quot;A technophobic view of the future places humans on the same highway to
<BR>
extinction [as the dinosaurs] driven there not by a cataclysmic meteor crash,
<BR>
but by the impact of robots with intelligence vastly superior to that of purely
<BR>
biological mankind.&quot;
