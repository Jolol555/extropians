<EM>&gt;&gt; Most free software is written by hobbiests - there is no 'cost',  no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; more than fooling around in your garage woodshop constitutes capital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; expenditure which has to be recouped.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well that sentence at least is testable. Is there any data available 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as to whom contribute what and where they are employed?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you want data on who contributed what, pick a project and look at
<BR>
the ChangeLog. In the context you snipped, I was talking about initial
<BR>
development. I wouldn't deny that mature free tools contain plenty of
<BR>
code written under contract, or written by people adapting free tools
<BR>
on their employer's dime for their employer's purposes. So what?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most of the free software I use is written by somebody employed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere for writing exactly that software. As you yourself are.
</EM><BR>
<P>What software are you using? What do you consider free? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't believe that free software is a hobbyist project anymore, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but would like to see data to show me wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>'free software' is a broad category. Some tools are getting enough use
<BR>
that institutions can develop to support and extend them. Again, so
<BR>
what? I don't see any evidence of the fundamental shift you imply.
