<P>
Greg makes some points -- lets partition them.
<BR>
<P>1) Remote colonization by &quot;unconscious&quot;, &quot;undivertable&quot; sub-SIs.
<BR>
<P>In this case, I think it comes down to the problem of &quot;remote&quot;
<BR>
matter (or energy) is of much lower value than &quot;local&quot; matter
<BR>
and energy.  It isn't the cost of getting the probes over to
<BR>
the remote star that is the problem, it is the cost of getting
<BR>
the remote matter &amp; energy *back* to the local star where
<BR>
it is of value to you.  I haven't done the delta-V analysis
<BR>
on the cost of quickly &quot;returning&quot; a solar system (star optional?)
<BR>
across several light years to the orbit of Oort cloud where you
<BR>
can use it, but I suspect it is very expensive.
<BR>
<P>Even if you don't send back matter &amp; energy, presumably you do
<BR>
communicate and the communication costs will be lower if you get
<BR>
closer.  How close you get will be determined by the cost to change
<BR>
your orbit relative to the volume of communication you would
<BR>
like to do.
<BR>
<P>(Spike might step in here -- how much does it cost to fling
<BR>
a Jupiter out of a solar system?).
<BR>
<P>2) Colonization by unhappy sub-SIs looking to expand.
<BR>
<P>In this case, you have to make a case that the sub-SIs are
<BR>
independent enough from the SI that they have sufficient
<BR>
personal freedom and autonomy to accomplish this.  England
<BR>
certainly didn't let the colonies go &quot;willingly&quot;.  Presumably
<BR>
the SI keeps sub-SIs either happy enough or relatively
<BR>
powerless so that any sub-SI probe/colonization ships
<BR>
that get sent out get zapped before they get very far.
<BR>
<P>Remember that the more information content the sub-SIs
<BR>
intend to take with them, the more matter or energy is
<BR>
going to have to be involved.  Hey -- &quot;What is that
<BR>
Galaxy Class Starship you are building there?&quot;  &quot;You
<BR>
are only authorized to build &quot;Delta Flyers!&quot;  As soon
<BR>
as the SI gets wind of any solar-system changing
<BR>
activities in a nearby star, you can bet it is going
<BR>
to investigate.  If SIs have the ability to dominate
<BR>
local regions of space then the sub-SIs have to go further
<BR>
away (taking longer or using much more energy, making
<BR>
them much more noticable).
<BR>
<P>If you have a moderately open society, SIs might let sub-SIs
<BR>
leave, but presumably there would have to be some very interesting
<BR>
treaty arrangements for future allocation of interstellar resources.
<BR>
(When you come down to the last 4 H atoms in the universe, who gets
<BR>
them?)
<BR>
<P>It seems the only cases where colonizers have let colonies go
<BR>
freely has been done is where the cost of administering them
<BR>
was lower than any benefit they could provide or when the
<BR>
colonies unexpectedly overthrew the administrative system
<BR>
and grew so fast that the cost of winning exceeded any
<BR>
long term benefit they might provide (from the perspective
<BR>
of an analysis done at that time).  It would be really
<BR>
interesting to study all of the colonizer/colony cases,
<BR>
their relative economic, military, etc. strengths &amp; weaknesses,
<BR>
abstract them to some basic economic principles and see
<BR>
how they apply vis-a-vis the SI/sub-SI relationships.
<BR>
You get into questions like, &quot;Would the American revolution
<BR>
have succeeded *if* America had been where France is?&quot;
<BR>
<P>If the pilgrims has been &quot;ants&quot;, I don't think King George
<BR>
(a human) would have had anywhere near as many problems with
<BR>
the colonies.  (Insert cartoon of King George stepping on an
<BR>
ant hill).
<BR>
<P>3) Colonization choices
<BR>
<P>There is a final aspect of this that I have been working on
<BR>
which revolves around the question of if you have the freedom
<BR>
to colonize, &quot;What do you colonize?&quot;  It turns out that
<BR>
brown dwarfs and M-class stars are *much* more abundant
<BR>
than the stars we can actually see.  Brown dwarfs particularly
<BR>
are going to be easier to dismantle because they are smaller
<BR>
and cooler (you can burn their H in thermonuclear reactors).  
<BR>
But so far my very rough calculations suggest that they
<BR>
may take a long time to dismantle (perhaps millions of
<BR>
years).  If that is accurate, Robin's theories may be correct
<BR>
but the colonization wave may proceed very slowly because
<BR>
the time constraint *isn't* light speed, but time it takes to
<BR>
dismantle large amounts of matter in gravity wells.  So
<BR>
large numbers of the Milky Way's Brown Dwarfs may be in the
<BR>
process of being dismantled to contribute to the MBrain
<BR>
population.  That is interesting from the perspective of
<BR>
what the Microlensing Observations *did not find* --
<BR>
no rogue planets and no brown dwarfs!  Our galaxy *may*
<BR>
be being consumed and the tasty bits are going first.
<BR>
The tasty bits *aren't* the closest ones but the ones
<BR>
you can dismantle the fastest.
<BR>
<P>I suspect there may be a frontier beyond which it makes
<BR>
absolutely no sense to quickly return any matter and energy to
<BR>
the parent because the transportation costs are *so* high.
<BR>
It may be better to send out a probe, construct only what
<BR>
is necessary to give a brown dwarf or star a gentle nudge,
<BR>
setup a &quot;this system is the property of SI 293203 beacon&quot;
<BR>
(and berserker drones if necessary), then wait 10,000,000
<BR>
years for it to show up on your doorstep rather than wasting
<BR>
it all just so you can get your next meal a bit earlier.
<BR>
<P>(Keep in mind that if MBrains switch over from stars
<BR>
as their primary energy source to thermonuclear reactors
<BR>
(as R.F. argues strongly), then they can control their
<BR>
thought (clock) rate and consume energy at exactly
<BR>
that rate that guarantees they run out just when the
<BR>
next meal is expected to ship in.  (Of course taking
<BR>
into account possible disruptions due to pirate
<BR>
sub-SIs.)
