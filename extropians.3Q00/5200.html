Actually, what Samantha describes is what is known as a hypnogogic trance, the
<BR>
same sort of phenomenon that is now thought to trigger sleepwalking, OOB
<BR>
experiences, and alien abduction experiences (which used to be thought of as
<BR>
visitations from the eldritch fairies). It has more, I think, to do with
<BR>
narcolepsy than epilepsy (having had two rather odd experiences myself once, and
<BR>
being a known narcoleptic from excessive caffiene use (its an odd allergy, that
<BR>
only comes up when I am taking about a half a pack a day of no-doze).

<EM>&gt; Not to get holy-roller on anyone here, but I agree with Samatha's conjecture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that if there is no God, then there is certainly room for one in a Universe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that includes suffering. What Samantha gets when she &quot;recieves a lift&quot; from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading certain religious tracts is one of the religious experiences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; described by 19th century psychologist Willam James.  Having a God module is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good if it connects one up with a sense of a better ethical system. If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leads only to the Inquisition torture chamber, then it's a bad bet.  So I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking 'outcomes' here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ultimately, it may turn out that some advanced primate species (humans) once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had a God module as part of their brain, and it helped them develop computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that colonized the cosmos, which in the end leads to an ultimate Mind (God)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which fixed things that needed fixing (since it has ultimate computing power)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and help resurrect people such as Samantha! This is more inspired from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading of Julian Barbour (The End of Time)  as well as Tipler and Barrow's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Final Anthropic Principle. Talk amongst yourselves, i'm getting ver-klempt!

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; But when the God module kicks in things happen similar to stuff in  the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  mystical literature.  I don't levitate or anything really wild like that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  but it feels as if my being is lifted up and sometimes turned inside out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and that I am within or in communion with or at least sense deeply this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  much larger Presence, Power, whatever you want to call it. The &quot;me&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  disappears mostly or melts into whatever this is or gets recast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  somehow.   The emotions soar into the heavens.  It goes beyond anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I can put into words pretty rapidly. Often it will include what seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  like a tremendous amount of information  and intensionality and directed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  energy sweeping through me.  I have guesses (ranging from faulty mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wiring to too much religous upbringing to substances sampled in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  youth  to Vingean powers looking for agents to ???) but no real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  explanation for it.  It just is - now and then.  Thankfully rare enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it doesn't totally sweep me away.  It came close when I used to meditate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  more.  Whatever it is meditation intensified it quite a bit.  So I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  stopped doing that because shadows of whatever this is became too strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to allow me to concentrate on my work easily.
