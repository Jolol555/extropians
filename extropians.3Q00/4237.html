<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The business cycle, or boom-bust cycle, appears to be an artifact of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fractional-reserve lending, or fiat-currency issue. The same dynamic was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; apparent at least a far back as the South Seas Bubble of 1721-3 (?).
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, boom bust cycles precede fractional reserve and fiat currency lending in
<BR>
the US by many decades. Properly managed reserve systems dampen boom/bust cycles
<BR>
so that rather than having lots of people starving to death, you merely have a
<BR>
small percentage go bankrupt.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and hides its fallout by shunting it to a slave underclass (such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; sweatshop workers in the 3rd world) and by playing games with illusory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; fiat-money which has no physical foundation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Fiat &quot;money&quot; issued by a central bank is the antithesis of a free market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and therefore of &quot;capitalism&quot;. It is a form of command economy, which is why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Marx advocated it. A truely free market will either have free banking, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; preferably no fractional reserve lending banks whatsoever. This of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; requires a modicum of education among traders as to the history and nature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of banking and money, which is entirely absent in the government-approved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; textbooks used in US public schools. This greatest of cons can only be pulled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the ignorant.
</EM><BR>
<P>A truly free market as you describe would require that all participants have
<BR>
total access to all information available in that economy, so everyone is making
<BR>
decisions based on their true best long term rational self interest. A reserve
<BR>
system does not act as a command economy, it is rather a feedback governor that
<BR>
allows the engine to operate in a significantly wide range, but prevents it from
<BR>
choking itself off or reving itself to disintegration.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As for free markets - until such time as the planet's GNP is so huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that rationing becomes irrelevant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is not a possibility.

<EM>&gt; The Credit Bubble Bulletin    - by Doug Noland
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  On the Manipulation of Money and Credit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   September 1, 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; “Sooner or later, the crisis must break out as the result of a change in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conduct of the banks.  The later the crack-up comes, the longer the period
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in which the calculation of the entrepreneurs is misguided by the issue of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; additional fiduciary media (i.e., banknotes and checking accounts not fully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backed by money).   The greater this additional quantity of fiduciary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money, the more factors of production have been firmly committed in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form of investments which appeared profitable only because of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artificially reduced interest rate and which prove to be unprofitable now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the interest rate has again been raised.  Great losses are sustained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a result of misdirected capital investments.” Ludwig von Mises, Von
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mises on the Manipulation of Money and Credit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Instead of understanding that a negative savings rate is indicative of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; severely distorted bubble economy, the bullish consensus sees the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continued borrowing and spending binge as evidence of a sound and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stable prosperity.  It is this momentous gap between the perceived
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supreme health of the current environment and the actual reality of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; massive financial and economic imbalances that is disturbingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reminiscent of the bubbles of 1929 in the U.S., 1989 in Japan, and 1996 in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SE Asia.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, the three episodes you speak of were not due to continued borrowing and
<BR>
spending, but due to outright fraud and misinformation across wide sectors of
<BR>
the economy disintegrating the metastable system of the bayesian market.
