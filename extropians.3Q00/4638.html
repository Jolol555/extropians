<EM>&gt; I have taken melatonin for its antioxidant, brain protecting effects, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stopped because there is some evidence that it suppresses GH release
</EM><BR>
<P><P>While the chemical toxicity is extremely low (i.e. it is very difficult to
<BR>
poison yourself in any meaningful way), it does have some odd physiological
<BR>
effects that haven't been fully explained, particularly when the dosage is
<BR>
high.
<BR>
<P>For example, a doc told me that large doses of melatonin (75mg) have been
<BR>
shown to prevent pregnancy in women, though as far as he was aware a
<BR>
mechanism was not known as to why this is.  He also said that there was no
<BR>
real evidence of toxicity at this level of intake, if you discount strange
<BR>
but apparently harmless things such as making women temporarily infertile. 
<BR>
What *is* clear is that science only has the faintest idea of how
<BR>
melatonin is actually used by and interacts with the body, so caution is
<BR>
appropriate.
<BR>
<P>Incidentally, I find &quot;antioxidant&quot; as a generally poor excuse to take
<BR>
something.  A fair percentage of all chemicals that have been described by
<BR>
science could be characterized as &quot;antioxidant&quot; in nature, and most are
<BR>
toxic.  It is akin to when food companies started putting big &quot;cholesterol
<BR>
free&quot; stickers on all their vegetable base products, with the apparent
<BR>
implication that someone else was making orange juice or cold cereal
<BR>
with a ton of cholesterol in it.  Or when health food companies fortify a
<BR>
food product with a couple common vitamins, but use longer technical names
<BR>
and tout it as having some type of scientifically engineered supernutrient
<BR>
that is unique to their product (actually, my favorite is the number of
<BR>
clever names they come up with for &quot;starch&quot; in their ingredient lists).
