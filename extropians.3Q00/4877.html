<EM>&gt;&gt;from eachother enough that it will make a lot of difference in the amount

<EM>&gt;&gt;of freedom individuals have?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Not &quot;positions&quot;, I mean specific policies. Gore's &quot;position&quot; on social 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;security is to keep it 100% public, Bush's is to privatize a very small 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;percentage (what % was it again?), which will still be confiscated from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;you, but which you will be able to decide which government approved stock 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;it goes into. In terms of actual difference that will make in anyone's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;life, it's not much, unless you consider it a first step towards dismantlement.
</EM><BR>
<P>A first step is much better than no step, or a step back. At present, 
<BR>
NOTHING is happening that would give us more liberty.
<BR>
<P>I can only point to Bush's actions in the past re gun control and the 
<BR>
Second Amendment. I don't want to start up the whole guns thread again, so 
<BR>
that's all I will say on the subject. Gore's policies in this respect are 
<BR>
crystal clear, and scare the merde out of me.
<BR>
<P>I do not appreciate many of Bush's other past policies, such as removing 
<BR>
drug education and rehabilitation in Texas while increasing prisons, but 
<BR>
Gore offers no better solution there.
<BR>
<P>The best reason I can give for supporting Bush at this point is that if we 
<BR>
get more Libertarians in congress, or a republican majority, at least Bush 
<BR>
is unlikely to veto any good legislation they pass, such as the recent 
<BR>
repeal of the marriage tax penalty.
