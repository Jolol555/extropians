<EM>&gt; I agree.  From a business perspective, too, the applications are arcane.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, certain forms of genetic programming, such as genetic algorithmns (GA)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been used in certain areas of engineering design where things are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highly formalizable -- you can create a system of [nonlinear] differential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equations to model, say, propellers blades, then use GA to solve them --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there isn't much else.  At least, there's little that someone is building a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viable business plan around.  No one, to my knowledge, is using them for,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say, e-commerce or web development.:)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am not sure that GA is actually useful for most classes of business
<BR>
problems, or at least, I think there are methods that give nearly as good
<BR>
results in a more deterministic fashion under the constraints of what
<BR>
businesses want.  While GA sounds good for offline, non-realtime problem
<BR>
solving domains, it has never seemed well-suited for environments where
<BR>
one needs to adapt to rapidly changing conditions in realtime.  Also,
<BR>
businesses are really uncomfortable replacing humans with machines in
<BR>
these spaces if the business algorithms cannot be explained in excruciating
<BR>
detail, which they can with people and plain old software (POS :^).
<BR>
<P>For example, I actually write (and sell) domain-specific commercial
<BR>
engines that are designed to replace (and improve on) the adaptive pattern
<BR>
matching ability of hundreds of people for realtime transactional systems.
<BR>
While not &quot;genetic&quot;, the engines actually have the capability to write,
<BR>
rewrite, and test in realtime (can't have broken or flawed code hosing
<BR>
mission critical online transactional systems), significant sections of
<BR>
their own code based largely on fundamental realtime changes in the data
<BR>
(and data structures -- it has to handle new data systems and
<BR>
substructures that weren't even conceived of when the systems was written
<BR>
while online, without human intervention) and patterns of usage.  
<BR>
<P>I am currently working with an extremely large multinational to move an
<BR>
entire division to one of these engines, but it is important to note where
<BR>
the real business resistance has come from.  While the software can
<BR>
demonstrably respond much faster without making mistakes than human
<BR>
operators using POS, and make modest but significant improvements in
<BR>
direct profits through superior handling of anomalous situations, the
<BR>
executive management was very concerned with the fact that it is not
<BR>
easily possible to figure out why and how a specific transaction was
<BR>
handled in the way that it was.  Also, some of the code written by the
<BR>
system is nigh inscrutable (never mind that it can change at any time), so
<BR>
reverse engineering it is a major pain in the ass.  In short, while the
<BR>
software is good at what it does, they have difficulty trusting software
<BR>
that can modify itself to do the job better based on moment to moment
<BR>
market conditions (as though human software was doing so much better). 
<BR>
This is understandable though; a flaw in the software can contractually
<BR>
bind them to lose millions of dollars at computer speeds, whereas flawed
<BR>
humans tend to propagate damage at a much slower rate.
<BR>
<P>So, in my opinion, the reasons you don't see genetic algorithms in most
<BR>
business systems are two-fold: 1) most business systems are transactional
<BR>
online systems that aren't particularly well suited for GA, and 2)
<BR>
business executives are leary of online transactional software that isn't
<BR>
based on static algorithms.
