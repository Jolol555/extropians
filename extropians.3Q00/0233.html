<EM>&gt; with a NUCLEAR warhead which would detonate as it got near the enemy missle!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, of course the whole point of a defensive missile is to phase out
<BR>
all nukes, not add a bunch more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  You don't need dead-on accuracy if a nuke is used!! lol
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually for that application you really do.  Remember that
<BR>
a re-entry body is spiralling like a football, travelling at very
<BR>
high velocity and has the ability to absorb an enormous amount
<BR>
of heat, since it must do so during a typical re-entry event.
<BR>
<P>I havent done the calcs rigorously, but recall that the re-entry
<BR>
body is travelling in the opposite direction as the antimissile
<BR>
missile, so the closing speed is likely at least 10 km/sec.
<BR>
Using very conservative estimates of heat flux capability
<BR>
of the RB, and pretty much ignoring the built in safety factor
<BR>
(recall that the last 89 re-entry tests in a row have been
<BR>
successful) and further recalling that the burst would likely
<BR>
occur in the very thin air (so no relying on the shock wave
<BR>
to help out) then one can see that a burst would need to
<BR>
occur within perhaps 100 meters of the RB, and even then
<BR>
I wouldnt bet that the radiation flux would be sufficient in the
<BR>
few milliseconds of exposure to either destroy the rad-hardened
<BR>
warhead or ablate away enough material to cause the re-entry
<BR>
body to fail.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, the commies have had an opposite approach to
<BR>
defense than the US.  They tend to exaggerate their
<BR>
capability, we tend to understate ours.  Note the parades
<BR>
of tanks and planes thru Moscow where they had them go
<BR>
around in a huge loop so as to convince the proletariat there
<BR>
were more of them than actually existed, whereas the US
<BR>
position has always been: when in doubt stamp it
<BR>
classified and hide everything.
<BR>
<P>The ABM treaty of 1972 allowed a number of antimissile
<BR>
missiles.  The commies deployed a number of systems that
<BR>
we can be pretty confident would not have worked.  The
<BR>
US had a few for a while, but took them away when it became
<BR>
clear the tech wasnt ready yet, and made no secret of the
<BR>
fact that we have no deployed antinuke system as allowed
<BR>
under the treaty.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I read the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Russians built a string of bunkers around Moscow which could repeatedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; launch these missles in a probably vain attempt at stopping hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incoming western missles from destroying the city.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its referenced in William E. Burrows' excellent book Critical Mass.
<BR>
My guess is that that system would not have stopped a damn one
<BR>
of the incoming, not one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  At least they addressed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the issue and did the best they could with the technology available to them.
</EM><BR>
<P>...which was quite insufficient at that time and now.  To stop
<BR>
a nuke missile after MIRV, you really need body to body contact,
<BR>
which requires the very fastest computers available today, plus a
<BR>
whole bunch of other support stuff that the bad guys dont have yet,
<BR>
wont have for some time to come, and is a hell of a challenge
<BR>
even for the good guys today.
<BR>
<P>John, you can thank your god, the rest of us flaming atheists can
<BR>
only thank nothing that we never had a nuke war.  John, you pray
<BR>
to your god, the rest of us can only hope and pray fervently to
<BR>
nobody that we never do.  spike
