<EM>&gt; For those interested in reading this without proprietary MS software:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $ &lt;world.doc tr -d \\0 | tr '\r\205\222\223\224\226' '\n.'\''&quot;&quot;-' | fmt | less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extracts the text quite readable, apart from some easily ignored
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crap at the beginning and end.

<P>Thanks, I hadn't had a chance to read it earlier.

<P>I liked Nick's essay.  It was particularly refreshing that he avoided
<BR>
most of the references to the 1990s and the year 2000, trying to really
<BR>
present a dialog that might have occured in 2050.  Naturally there was
<BR>
some discussion of expectations of 50 years earlier since they were
<BR>
talking about progress over 50 years.  But Nick also had them looking
<BR>
back at events in the 2010s and 2020s, which is entirely realistic.
<BR>
<P>I'm not a big fan of transparency, so I wasn't thrilled with Nick's
<BR>
reliance on that social convention as the explanation of why the world
<BR>
hadn't destroyed itself.  Transparency raises many difficult issues, as
<BR>
we have discussed here before.  While Nick's essay was not the place to
<BR>
defend it, I was uncomfortable seeing his panelists give an endorsement
<BR>
to a technology which I feel brings serious problems.
<BR>
<P>It was amusing to see the panelists consider the possibility that the
<BR>
universe has multiple branches and that humanity has wiped itself out in
<BR>
most of them.  It seems to me that since their personal experiences of
<BR>
the world have apparently not been harmed by the hypothetical deletion
<BR>
of their cousins in other branches, they might well adopt the view that
<BR>
there is no reason for caution with regard to new technologies.  As long
<BR>
as some branch survives with them in it then they will be as satisfied
<BR>
with life as they are at present, since they have already experienced
<BR>
a similar pruning.
