<BR>
<P>This edition of &quot;Talking Points&quot; features &quot;The Rain Forest Myth.&quot;
<BR>
The next copy will discuss FACTS surrounding the recent run-up in
<BR>
gasoline prices and issue three will feature &quot;Social Security:
<BR>
The Worlds Worst Investment.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The Rainforest Myth
<BR>
<P>Even before we enter school, we are made aware of earth's fragile
<BR>
environment. And although this fragility may exist, its existence
<BR>
is often overblown by those making a livelihood through the
<BR>
manufacture, promotion, and exploitation of alleged environmental
<BR>
catastrophes. Two such areas stand out among all others: Global
<BR>
Warming and the Rainforests.
<BR>
<P>Hysterians and other special interests recently received a
<BR>
&quot;spanking&quot; on the American Investigator cable show called &quot;Amazon
<BR>
Rainforest:  Clear-cutting the Myths.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This syndicated television program disclosed how the amazon
<BR>
Rainforest is actually one of the most intact and least
<BR>
endangered forests on the planet.  Contrary to the claim made by
<BR>
Al Gore in his &quot;Earth In The Balance,&quot; the world's tropical
<BR>
rainforests will not disappear halfway through this century. In
<BR>
reality, the Amazon Rainforest is not only holding its own, but
<BR>
is in a constant state of regeneration. As the Environmental
<BR>
Defense Fund concedes in their fine print, the amazon is actually
<BR>
87.5%-94% intact.
<BR>
<P>Patrick Moore, a Greenpeace co-founder (recently resigned),
<BR>
claims that the threats to the Rainforests are greatly
<BR>
exaggerated. He goes on to state &quot;All these save-the-forests
<BR>
arguments are based on bad science.&quot; Moore also contends that if
<BR>
one were to accept the deforestation claims of the hysterians,
<BR>
&quot;You would have cleared 50 times the size of the Amazon already
<BR>
if accurate.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And contrary to claims the Amazon is &quot;The lungs of the Earth,&quot;
<BR>
the Rainforests have only been around for an estimated
<BR>
12,000-16,000 years.  This by itself makes it difficult to argue
<BR>
the destiny of the earth is linked to it's health. Additionally,
<BR>
many eco-scientists believe the Amazon may actually be a net user
<BR>
of oxygen. Philip Scott from the University of London points out
<BR>
&quot;In fact, because the trees fall down and decay, rainforests
<BR>
actually take in more oxygen than they give out.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And no, there are not 100 extinctions of species per day as
<BR>
claimed by Al Gore, and there are not 50,000/year as claimed by
<BR>
Harvard's Edward Wilson.  In fact, when asked to name a specie
<BR>
which has become extinct, Wilson couldn't name a single one!
