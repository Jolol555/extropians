Actually, Courtney is far more than another Yoko Ono. She was pretty successful
<BR>
at the local/regional level with her own band before she met Cobain. You may not
<BR>
have a taste for her music, her stuff is so/so with me, but I can say that
<BR>
dealing with the infantile addictive bullshit Cobain put her through before he
<BR>
performed his last act of idiotic rebellion (and I get this from first hand
<BR>
sources that Cobain was a spoiled rotten little shit) entitles her to make
<BR>
whatever money off of her own work as she desires, and the fact she was married
<BR>
to Cobain is quite irrelevant to the quality of or salability of her music. Both
<BR>
her and Nirvana's music was always a commercial thing, despite Cobain's whiney
<BR>
GenX protestations.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Go read Courtney Love's article in Salon sometime.  Most artists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  are getting toally screwed.  Y

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Courtney love is a big phony baloney. Ask me what I think Kurt Cobain died
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; She is not an artist, she is as Tom Waits and Primus so aptly put it:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;riding on the coattails of a deadman&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am surprised you didn't add that to your list of ways to get rich without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copyright - marry someone famous and steal their limelight
