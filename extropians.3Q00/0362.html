<P>I agree that religion is a social technology of a sort.  Successful
<BR>
ones manage to change with the times, which means that they are a
<BR>
meta-meme, not a simple meme.   It appears that the fact that it is a
<BR>
social technology is obscured deliberately by the priestly class out
<BR>
of fear of losing adherents.  I think this is why doctrinal changes
<BR>
that are required for survival (think Catholicism in the USA) are
<BR>
slow in coming.   You can't change the things that people are
<BR>
supposed to have blind faith in very quickly.  This appears to me to
<BR>
be a major failing, especially as the world speeds up.
<BR>
<P>It has occurred to me and many others that a carefully designed
<BR>
religion could grow and adapt very rapidly.  It's not clear how much
<BR>
of the fitness space for religions has actually been explored, or how
<BR>
that space is changing due to global communications.
<BR>
<P>It would be interesting to see a viral meme religion that defined the
<BR>
social contract (as we've been discussing) in a way that was not
<BR>
coercive of conformity.   I'd still probably be against it on general
<BR>
principles of rationality.   Programming people to act the way that I
<BR>
want them to doesn't promote rationality at all.
