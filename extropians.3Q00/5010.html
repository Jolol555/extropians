<EM> &gt; You and all of us.  I have over a thousand titles, most of em
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hardback.  Ideally I would like to ASCII all the text without
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; destroying the books, if possible.  Let me know if you find
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;without destroying the books&quot;
<BR>
<P>If you succeed in this effort, would you still keep the books?
<BR>
<P>I like books. I like the feel of paper in my hand, and reading
<BR>
from a printed page. I like bringing a volume on buses, trains,
<BR>
to cafes. I like sitting on my couch with afghan around me with
<BR>
my favorite music playing, a small reading light and maybe some
<BR>
candles and a glass of wine.
<BR>
<P>My books reflect some decades of thinking and interests and
<BR>
evolving and having them around me is like wearing a comfortable piece
<BR>
of clothing. I don't feel at home, until my books are out of the
<BR>
boxes and onto the shelves. If I design a virtual reality of my
<BR>
home in the future, the virtual reality would have to have shelves
<BR>
of my books. For my future version of myself, I would design
<BR>
myself still liking books.
<BR>
<P>I don't like reading long texts electronically. I would be tickled
<BR>
pink to have my books electronically available with which to search,
<BR>
so I would like electronic versions too, although I would ideally
<BR>
like to be able to search on equations too.
<BR>
<P>I'm finding that my small library, (average in comparison
<BR>
to my Bay Area friends). is unusual among my colleagues here in Germany.
<BR>
As my friends and colleagues helped me move a couple of weeks ago,
<BR>
it's become a kind of inside joke in my group ('what is in these
<BR>
boxes?' 'viele viele bucher ...!'), but I notice that at the
<BR>
same time they want to spend hours browsing my books.
<BR>
<P>I have a sense that many here have similar small libraries; are
<BR>
we so unusual to other people?
<BR>
<P>Eugene says:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have the same problem. I even stopped buying dead tree because I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can't move with them in style
</EM><BR>
<P>Please define &quot;in style&quot; ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And, yeah, lugging less stuff around does really free the mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, you don't need to devote as much of your brain to keep track
<BR>
of those titles. Yes, useful.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, there's something irresistably gemuetlich about
<BR>
having one's books around [and they are best replacement for T.V. (IMO)].
<BR>
And living in a foreign country with no fluency in the foreign language,
<BR>
the local libraries are frustratingly useless for me, so my library has
<BR>
become my backup reseach support after the professional journals.
<BR>
(Even my institute's professional library is weak, especially in comparison
<BR>
to large U.S. university libraries. I really miss Stanford's bookstore and
<BR>
libraries.)
