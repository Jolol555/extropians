<EM>&gt;     &gt;If one sends an &quot;archived&quot; message em signals of all types including gammma
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;ray photons could  conceivably blow parts of a sustained message away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please explain how a gamma ray photon could blow a radio photon away.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gamma ray photon hits radio photon, cancels out energy of said photon, or merly
<BR>
knocks it down to a lower frequency (or up to a higher frequency). If the signal
<BR>
is frequency modulated, your signal loses resolution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;We have just had (for 40 years) the experience of receiving signals, because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;testing of sending  signals has not been a technologically achivable option yet :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;i.e we have no  large receiveing antena even circling the Oort cloud to confirm how well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; signals travel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh come on now! We've bounced RADAR signals off the moons of Neptune, are you saying that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when outgoing signals go a little further out they come to a screeching halt for some mysterious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason but incoming signals don't? You're being silly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ever heard of radar jamming, john? Radars also have a range that is related to
<BR>
both its radiating power and the sensitivity of its receiver. At some point the
<BR>
radiated signal has spread out so far (and any reflection spreads out so far
<BR>
coming back) that it is too close (or below) the background radiation for that
<BR>
frequency for the sensitivity of the receiver to detect a coherent signal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;As for neutrinos-they penetrate everything, almost.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yea, and they penetrate your receiver too making them almost impossible to detect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For about a thousand dollars you could make a device that can detect trillions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; radio photons every second from billions of light years away. For about 10 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollars you could make a device able to detect one neutrino a month from the sun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't imagine a worse medium of communication than neutrinos.
</EM><BR>
<P>You just are not making your neutradio from the right materials, obviously.
