&nbsp;------------------ 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't see too many homo erectus wandering around these days,
</EM><BR>
yet no one laments their disappearance.&lt;
<BR>
<P>Good point.  While there is a bit of an absurdity in the favored
<BR>
species preservation agenda, efforts are made in putting together
<BR>
the missing parts of our own past skeletal structures which are
<BR>
modestly regenerated for viewing, but uanble to walk around.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Maybe I am alone in this, but I don't see anything wrong with
</EM><BR>
extinction in principle.  For every species that becomes extinct,
<BR>
a new one pops into existence to take its place, and probably
<BR>
does a better job of it.  I simply can't fathom how the government,
<BR>
at the direction of environmental groups, can spend millions
<BR>
or billions of dollars to save a rare insect that was obviously
<BR>
poorly adapted to survive anyway.  What a waste of resources.
<BR>
&nbsp;With only a small number of exceptions, most species that
<BR>
become exinct today would have become extinct in a relatively
<BR>
short period of time anyway, with or without our help.&lt;
<BR>
<P>This is my view:  When we are able to preserve ourselves first,
<BR>
we can then work to preserve other species.  
<BR>
<P>The very fact that more efforts and dollars are spent preserving
<BR>
a limited lifespan for other species while avoiding or ignoring
<BR>
the individual extinction of our own species, person by person
<BR>
by death, is deplorable.
