Hello,
<BR>
<P>I recently read this item:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cannabisculture.com/cgi/article.cgi?num=1612">http://www.cannabisculture.com/cgi/article.cgi?num=1612</A>
<BR>
<P>Basically, on the Fourth of July a journalist was beaten illegally.  I
<BR>
wasn't there so cannot vouch for the chain of events.
<BR>
<P>I am interested in seeing photographic or video evidence of this event,
<BR>
or publication of it in the regular media.  I realize this list is not
<BR>
about this kind of issue, yet some readers might be aware of alternative
<BR>
source wherein this evidence is presented for view by the public.
<BR>
<P>Police brutality by itself is not justification for abolishing drug
<BR>
prohibition, that cause has enough merits on its own.  Police brutality
<BR>
is justification for firing police and restructuring law-enforcement
<BR>
organizations.  There are plenty of good public safety officers, and
<BR>
plenty of good public safety officers that know drug prohibition and its
<BR>
concurrent war on the people in the name of said war are inherently not
<BR>
good for society.
<BR>
<P>The news article alleges that armed policeman criminally assaulted the
<BR>
journalist, Pete Brady, upon provocation by photographing the illegal
<BR>
searches and seizures of these rogue vigilantist uniformed thugs on
<BR>
Independence Day.  If these public employees have commited a crime, this
<BR>
list has informed us that any citizen can file criminal charges against
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>Once again, police serve a vital and beneficial role, as well as enforce
<BR>
bad laws, selectively.  For those advocates of a rosy transparency
<BR>
future, this is another small example that the evil ones can't bear
<BR>
light upon them, and thus require the most.
<BR>
<P>The irony of this alleged event on the national holiday is implied.
<BR>
<P>If you know another who might have information about viewing chronicles
<BR>
of this event, please let them know thus that interested parties might
<BR>
make their own judgment.
<BR>
<P>Have a nice day,
<BR>
<P>Ross

<P>&quot;Cops bust Cannabis Culture journalist
<BR>
by Bianca Sind (07 Jul, 2000) CC correspondent Pete Brady arrested and
<BR>
beaten during Washington DC hempfest.
<BR>
<P>The thirtieth annual Fourth of July Smoke-Out in Washington, DC ended
<BR>
with an unexpected type of fireworks this year.
<BR>
<P>The event began peacefully in Lafayette Park, a few hundred feet from
<BR>
the White House, at noon on a typically hot and humid July 4th. For
<BR>
three hours, the crowd of approximately 4,000 people heard a variety of
<BR>
speeches from cannabis activists, including NORML director Keith Stroup,
<BR>
Pot-TV's Miriam White, drug reform policy expert Kevin Zeese, and Yippie
<BR>
anarchist Dana Beal.
<BR>
<P>Police were present, but did not enforce marijuana laws while the event
<BR>
was held at Lafayette Park. At approximately 3:30, however, the crowd
<BR>
began an orderly march south past the White House, eventually ending up
<BR>
in two large fields where event organizers provided quality musical acts
<BR>
and more speeches.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, SWAT team police began moving through the crowd. They
<BR>
conducted illegal searches and seizures, used coercion and fear tactics
<BR>
against many of the younger members of the audience, pulled dozens of
<BR>
people out of the parks, and arrested several people.
<BR>
<P>CANNABIS CULTURE international correspondent Pete Brady, accompanied by
<BR>
CC videographer Chadman, began following police, recording their
<BR>
intimidating actions and challenging them. Brady took the stage and
<BR>
pointedly told police they were not welcome at the event, and instructed
<BR>
audience members to shadow the police and exercise free speech. Soon,
<BR>
dozens of courageous youth were surrounding police at every arrest site,
<BR>
shouting invectives and anti-drug war slogans.
<BR>
<P>Police responded by threatening Brady and Chadman. They told the pair,
<BR>
along with other journalists and activists, that they would be punished
<BR>
for taking pictures and video of the arrests. Brady and New York
<BR>
activist Rob Robinson repeatedly informed police that journalists have a
<BR>
legal right to take pictures at public events. Police told Brady,
<BR>
Robinson and others that they would be harmed by police if they
<BR>
continued to take photos and voice their opinions about police actions.
<BR>
<P>At 8:30pm, Brady was photographing another arrest; two officers told him
<BR>
to stop. Brady asked the officers if there was an official US Park
<BR>
Service policy governing photographer's access to photo opportunities.
<BR>
Suddenly, a large officer knocked Brady to the ground, and a group of
<BR>
officers swarmed on top of him.
<BR>
<P>A crowd of approximately 200 people, many of them throwing rocks and
<BR>
bottles, surrounded the police, who continued to beat Brady as he lay
<BR>
motionless on the ground.
<BR>
<P>Brady was dragged away, beaten again, and thrown into a paddy wagon. He
<BR>
was arrested and taken to DC General Hospital, and then to jail. NORML
<BR>
Director Keith Stroup, and Common Sense for Drug Policy Director Kevin
<BR>
Zeese visited the jail the next morning to help expedite Brady's
<BR>
release.
<BR>
<P>Police stole Brady's cameras, reporter's notebooks and film. They also
<BR>
attacked his girlfriend and pried his tape recorder out of her hands.
<BR>
<P>Brady has broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder and a concussion.
<BR>
