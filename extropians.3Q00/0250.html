<EM>&gt;An interesting post, but I think divergent views might stem from more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complicated origins than the dichotomy Greg proposes. Again, I can't speak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from a US perspective (despite having glutted myself on Heinlein etc in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time). I can say that my sense of how most people view this issue in Oz is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as something often best handled on a user-pays-if-possible basis, but often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with fees *graduated*, in the interests of a sort of Kantian fairness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maybe it comes of an early (white) history here of almost entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unpredictable wins and losses. The landscape was absurdly inhospitable to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agriculture and herding, and everything catches fire and burns to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ground rather a lot. Gold was found in quantities that disrupted the entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nation for some years, making daily life a lottery (and we still gamble to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an insane degree). So people learned to depend on each other a great deal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to see each other as `mates' - not rivals. This developed in an atmosphere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of distrust of and dislike for authorities, understandably given convict
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;origins (although most settlers were *not* convicts and were quick to deny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;`the stain').
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think the outcome of this history was to bias us toward practical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;solutions that involved *those who happen to have*, today, chipping in for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*those who happen to be down on their luck*, in good evolutionary altruist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fashion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How was this to be arranged in a very large and mostly empty nation? You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;couldn't just depend on your physical neighbor, who might be many miles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;away but likely to be caught in the same local trap. The general notion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that we were all in the same fix, and should share the benefits around,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;came naturally.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In practice, this means that the well-off (having a margin of surplus) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deemed to have a duty to put a larger proportion into the pot. On the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hand, inmany respects egalitarianism gives way to simplicity (and, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suppose, self-respect): everyone except the elderly and infirm pays the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same for train or tram or bus fare, and a loaf of bread and litre of milk,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and litre of petrol. And since many medicines are centrally subsidised, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rich also get their prescriptions filled for $20 or thereabouts, as do the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less well-off. Taxes are graduated, with a maximum of 30% up to incomes of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;$50K a year, although rising to 47% for the wealthier (but I doubt anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with a tax accountant pays that). This blend of everyone paying the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for many services and consumables, and the better-off paying a lot more for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taxes, is accepted, by and large, as a reasonable compromise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nobody ever suggests that everyone in the country should pay the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dollar amount in tax - `$10,000 per person, rich or poor' - nor could that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work without abolishing many benefits that are accepted as worth having. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suppose this is not greatly different from the way things have panned out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the States, except for our somewhat more mutually dependant early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Zeitgeist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't know if this helps the discussion or will be dismissed as more blah
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blah blah, which maybe it is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Greg sez: &lt;People aren't trained very well in the exercise of freedom and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-responsibility &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't propose any solution for this problem here.  I just think this is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;crucial factor in the debate that isn't addressed adequately by either 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;side.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm sure that's right, but again, there are different and perhaps arguably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no less viable ways of doing things that *don't* require that the poor with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very few reserves for insurance (charged equally for all, I assume) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;left without any access to routine support - the kind of situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prevalent during the Depression, before many of today's ameliorative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;measures were introduced.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But this is all terribly close to the no-no of `debating the basics', so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably won't continue with it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt; sighs of relief from the assembled company &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Damien Broderick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
The problems are the one-size-fits-all nature of the solution and the fact 
<BR>
that it's coercive and the free-riders and the fact that when you subsidize 
<BR>
anything, you tend to get more of it.  Free medical care, etc. boils down to 
<BR>
paying for it in delays, quotas, rationing and lines, and the demand always 
<BR>
rises to exceed the supply.
<BR>
<P>Then you have the problem of those who are on the high end of the demand - 
<BR>
the elderly and the terminally ill.  It's often clear that you could save 
<BR>
more man years by putting the money into something actually productive - 
<BR>
like education of the young or research into diseases that effect people 
<BR>
still in their productive years - like aging itself, but this raises major 
<BR>
moral issues, especially when you've essentially guaranteed full medical 
<BR>
care for all.
<BR>
<P>I suggest once again that hypothetical constructs like the &quot;social 
<BR>
contract,&quot; will only be effective in changing society when they are turned 
<BR>
into functional, real, legal, economic constructs.  A real universal social 
<BR>
contract, spelled out, would eliminate much of the deadlock on these issues.
