<P>
<EM>&gt; The so-called &quot;illegitimate&quot; broadcasters could just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easily do the same, there's simply no &quot;legitimacy&quot; if you don't own your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; content.  It would boil down to whoever was best at getting the content to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lots of people and there's simply no a priori reason to suppose that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original broadcaster would be best at that.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're entirely correct.  The most well-known, highest-revenue
<BR>
broadcaster will be the one who can best reach consumers and
<BR>
provide the content they want, regardless of its source, and who
<BR>
provide good service to customers in other ways.  Clearly, then,
<BR>
it will be in the interest of such broadcasters to maintain their
<BR>
market position by commissioning new creative works, so that they
<BR>
can retain their reputation with their audience as the best place
<BR>
to find new quality art.  There may be lots of broadcasters who
<BR>
do nothing but non-original work, and they'll have their market
<BR>
niche as well, but the big boys will always have the popular bands
<BR>
and shows, and will use every ounce of hype and every technology
<BR>
and every contractual means they can to make sure the consumer's
<BR>
eyeballs are pointed to the right place to find them.
