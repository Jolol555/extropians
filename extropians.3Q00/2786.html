<P>There is a tech billioniare whose name eludes me(not Gates) who has said as an engineer it bothered him that the business suits and lawyers seemed to parasitically prosper off the work of his fellow engineers and scientists.  
<BR>
<P>He said he just knew if he could combine his technical knowledge with the right business skills he could turn the tables.  And he did.
<BR>
<P>He had been an engineering professor who took something he developed to market.  He had experienced a bad marriage and a midlife crisis and decided he had to do something to make his life standout.
<BR>
<P>This man comes from a poor background and joined the navy where his technical skills were first discovered and encouraged.  I can't remember the name though...  Any ideas?
