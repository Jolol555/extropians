<EM>&gt; One thing I like about nanotechnology is that it can be used to aid and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; measure quality processes with manufacturing.  For example, if nano is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applied to some process or method then it might make some economically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viable where they otherwise might not be, in terms of utility.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I agree nanotech can be used to &quot;aid and measure quality,&quot; the example
<BR>
Ross gives seems to be off the mark.  To me, aiding in quality would be any
<BR>
thing or process that increases quality, such as testing a product before
<BR>
rolling it out the door and making changes based on the tests (and then, of
<BR>
course, retesting).  Or having clear specifications and requirements for the
<BR>
product.  (Working in the software industry, I've seen people build product
<BR>
without such.:)
<BR>
<P>Measuring quality would be any thing or process that yields information
<BR>
quality, such as some way of probing metal parts for aircraft to make sure
<BR>
they don't have microfractures.
<BR>
<P>Of course, the two go hand in hand.  I think nanotechnology could be
<BR>
directly applied to both, since it will allow finer control over
<BR>
construction of things as well as finer detection of flaws in them.
<BR>
<P>I also agree with the example Ross uses, those this is one of nanotechnology
<BR>
increases the capabilities of building (and repairing) things overall.  I
<BR>
believe, if it pans out, it will allow things to be built which hitherto
<BR>
could either not be built at all or which would be cost prohibitive (the
<BR>
abstract example he uses).  But most people on this list already know that.
<BR>
<P>That said, I wish stuff would start to leave the lab.  Of course, there are
<BR>
no nanoassemblers in Drexler's sense yet, but some things could be massed
<BR>
produced using current technology, such as nanowire, nanotubes, and the like
<BR>
and start to find their way into non-nanotech products, such as cars,
<BR>
aircraft, space vehicles, and lab equipment.  (Nanoscale measuring devices
<BR>
would be especially good for the lab.)
<BR>
<P>My two cents!
