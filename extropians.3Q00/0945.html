<EM>&gt; Yes, it depends on whether information is luxury or necessity.  And yes it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be nice to hear more from him on this.  But he did outline his reasoning in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the prior paragraphs.  (&quot;Third World families ... did not want to watch pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; graphics ... they wanted to live in nice houses, drive cars, and eat meat.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not saying I'm persuaded, but his is a reasonable position to take.

<EM>&gt; As I've said, Krugman and most economists can be faulted for not understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific technologies in more detail.  But most futurists can be faulted for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not understanding much economics.  The later sin seems much greater to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>However, he fails to apply his agriculture argument to production of houses,
<BR>
cars, and meat. When the price of a built house, car, or meat drops to commodity
<BR>
levels (manufactured housing, eco-speck cars, and vat grown meat) then that
<BR>
segment of industry requires a far smaller segment of the population to produce
<BR>
and far smaller percent of per capita income to acquire (just as has happened
<BR>
with food production), then that segment of the economy takes on less
<BR>
importance, as he claims. He myopically fails to forsee any progress in
<BR>
technologies for reducing the cost of these commodities in 100 years time, which
<BR>
I find to be a huge fault of his argument.
