<EM>&gt; OK, I know why *we* would want AI to be friendly.  But why would the AI want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be friendly to us?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But most likely I’d
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably feel that these far lesser intelligences were not worthy of my time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and attention and, worse, I’d feel that they were trying to exploit me by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asking me to devote my time and energy to their “puny, little problems” when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could be out instead exploring the fascinating great beyond.
</EM><BR>
<P>Looks to me like you just answered your own question.  That is how *you* would
<BR>
feel.  Why?  Because you are an evolved human, with all manner of
<BR>
sophisticated, evolved hardware which establishes observer-biased goals and
<BR>
observer-biased beliefs and all manner of social perceptions for detecting
<BR>
cheating and avoiding exploitation... as was an advantage in your ancestral
<BR>
environment.
<BR>
<P>You can't reason from your own intuitions about goals to the actions of
<BR>
superintelligence.
<BR>
<P>If, as seems to be the default scenario, all supergoals are ultimately
<BR>
arbitrary, then the superintelligence should do what we ask it to, for lack of
<BR>
anything better to do.
