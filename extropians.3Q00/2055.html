<EM> &gt; &gt; OK I found that Roy Buchanan wrote and performed CC Rider.

<P>OK, this is proof everything that has ever been known about anything is out
<BR>
there.  On the web.  Somewhere.  Your task it to find it.
<BR>
<P>When I was doing family history research a decade ago, I worked
<BR>
in a genealogy library in San Bruno.  After months of searching I
<BR>
managed to uncover everything I sought, but during that search I
<BR>
did the following interesting order of magnitude calculation.
<BR>
<P>If one assumes the US has 300 megapersons today and started
<BR>
in 1776 with 10 megapersons, then assume a linear increase
<BR>
(for conservative estimates), estimate an average lifespan of about
<BR>
50 years, then there have been about 0.7 gigapersons that have
<BR>
lived in America in modern times and therefor have some chance
<BR>
of having their names recorded in that genealogical library.
<BR>
<P>If one counts the number of volumes on one shelf, multiplies by the
<BR>
number of shelves in a row, multiplies by the number of row in
<BR>
the library, then reads a few indices, counting the names, multiplying
<BR>
by the number of volumes, totally ignoring the reams of microfilm
<BR>
and microfiche, one finds the interesting ROM estimate of around
<BR>
.1 terapersons in that library, whose names are printed on dead
<BR>
trees alone.  So each American who ever lived is mentioned in
<BR>
that library on the order of 100 times on average.
<BR>
<P>And you cannot find any of them.
<BR>
<P>The one you want, without extensive searching, will not be found,
<BR>
even a single mention, with current technology.  All that woodpulp
<BR>
recorded material needs to be digitized somehow into ASCII files,
<BR>
otherwise it is *almost* useless.  spike
