Eugene Leitl writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; An immature upload is a full-detail emulation of a human's low-level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neuronal processes (at, say, compartmental emulation level) based on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data set more or less imediately derived from digitized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neuroanatomy. Apart from being potentially immortal and having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a radically expanded control of itself and it's (rendered)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surroundings it is very human.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is very human and very hypothetical, since nothing like this presently
<BR>
exists, right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A mature upload is something which has made extensive edits to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above dataset (or is derived from above original dataset in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; darwinian fashion), and is encoded in a fashion which runs more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficiently on the (computronium) hardware (both the hardware and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encoding will have to undergo several optimization steps for this to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; succeed). It is much faster than an immature upload (operates on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time scale 10^3..10^6 faster than we), and requires a fraction of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources to operate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since &quot;Computronium&quot; is a hypothetical substance in which each processing cell
<BR>
of a CA is reduced to atomic scale and arranged in a crystal lattice we can rule
<BR>
this out as a viable element of any actual AI that could currently evolve from
<BR>
genetic programming, right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another definition is that a population of mature AIs can't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; snuffed out by AIs created by evolutionary algorithms. They can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; persist in a stable equilibrium with them (nice trick, that).
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, they *could* perist if they had any chance of becoming real (nice fantasy
<BR>
that).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is supposedly a traversable development trajectory from immature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to mature. Since it's unlikely any of us will be a player in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game, we will be essentially dependant on their freely flowing milk of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; posthuman kindness for 1) protecting us from AIs 2) not snuff us out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of AIs
</EM><BR>
<P>Now I see why you don't trust AI. You're afraid it might unravel your
<BR>
suppositions and push your face into the reality that life is not a game.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; (And what's wrong with letting the Amish go extinct?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In principle, nothing. However, being human, I would object.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They should be given a choice, those who reject the choice I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still upload by force (now things do become ethically iffy), erasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their short-term memory of what just happened and given an illusion of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjective continuity of existance. As long as I can spare the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources, they would be free to pursue what they did before, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course being given opportunities to leave their self-imposed seclusion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at any step of the game, and certainly if/when I can't afford the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's very generous of you. I suppose you would also upload Hitlerists,
<BR>
Stalinists, mass murderers, child molesters, and other offshoots of human
<BR>
deviation and defective brain function (nice collection that).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; So we should speed the occurrence of mature uploads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes. I think in 10-15 years we should be able to make individually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realistic computational models of nematodes, provided we establish and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fund a large project now. After that, you have to scale this up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher animals in a series of steps. (E.g. C. elegans,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; D. melanogaster, &lt;some suitable intermediate here&gt;, M. musculus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; H. sapiens).
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you for providing yet another excuse for me to get drunk. I knew you were
<BR>
intelligent, but I had forgotten that intelligence often degenerates into
<BR>
insanity (as it has in your case).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Once we can simulate nematodes, perhaps people will start seeing value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in developing means for vitrifying brains of terminal and freshly dead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people right in the here and now. Meanwhile, several thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people per hour will be continuing dying irreversibly while we will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue waffling about AI, SI, nanotechnology, and properties of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metallic xenon and unicorns, and whether their horns are really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mohs&gt;10.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, now I better understand why the military has such a huge investment in AI
<BR>
(this just confirms what I already knew). The world has filled up with unhinged
<BR>
minds and loose cannons of speculative thought. Sane people will need all the AI
<BR>
we can muster in order to properly manage the onslaught of crazed engineers who
<BR>
have no clue about their own detachment from reality.
<BR>
<P>&quot;When we remember we are all mad, the mysteries disappear and
<BR>
life stands explained.&quot;  --Mark Twain
