New Scientist has an interview with Igor Aleksander of Imperial College,
<BR>
London about his new book &quot;How to build a Mind&quot;. From this interview it
<BR>
seems as though there are several groups around the world working in this
<BR>
area.

<P><P><EM>&gt; What's an engineer doing up to his elbows in neurons? Intelligent things,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; says Igor Aleksander of Imperial College London. He was one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pioneers of neural computers that borrow heavily on the brain's design.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the 1980s, they could learn, recognise patterns and have since found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their place in everything from controlling flight simulators to focusing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your camera. Now they're going back to their roots, helping us to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand the human brain. Aleksander believes you can even talk of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines that have imagination. Jeremy Webb asked him if he was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; serious about the claims in his book How to Build a Mind
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Q. That is a very provocative book title because it implies that you know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how to do it. Do you?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A. No. But I hope to find out by doing it. When they don't understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something engineers try to build it. But there is an intended frisson in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you might expect to be able to build a brain, but not a mind,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whereas I'm arguing that a mind is an emergent property of brains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one might build.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How to Build a Mind is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (ISBN 029784296X)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; From New Scientist magazine, 19 August 2000.
