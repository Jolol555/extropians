<BR>

<P>WEST'S REVISED CODE OF WASHINGTON ANNOTATED
<BR>
TITLE 42. PUBLIC OFFICERS AND AGENCIES
<BR>
CHAPTER 42.17. DISCLOSURE--CAMPAIGN FINANCES--LOBBYING--RECORDS
<BR>
<P>Current through End of 1998 Reg. Sess.
<BR>
<P><P>42.17.010. Declaration of policy
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hereby declared by the sovereign people to be the public policy of
<BR>
the state of Washington:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That political campaign and lobbying contributions and expenditures be
<BR>
fully disclosed to the public and that secrecy is to be avoided.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the people have the right to expect from their elected
<BR>
representatives at all levels of government the utmost of integrity,
<BR>
honesty, and fairness in their dealings.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the people shall be assured that the private financial dealings of
<BR>
their public officials, and of candidates for those offices, present no
<BR>
conflict of interest between the public trust and private interest.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That our representative form of government is founded on a belief that
<BR>
those entrusted with the offices of government have nothing to fear from
<BR>
full public disclosure of their financial and business holdings, provided
<BR>
those officials deal honestly and fairly with the people.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That public confidence in government at all levels is essential and
<BR>
must be promoted by all possible means.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That public confidence in government at all levels can best be
<BR>
sustained by assuring the people of the impartiality and honesty of the
<BR>
officials in all public transactions and decisions.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the concept of attempting to increase financial participation of
<BR>
individual contributors in political campaigns is encouraged by the passage
<BR>
of the Revenue Act of 1971 by the Congress of the United States, and in
<BR>
consequence thereof, it is desirable to have implementing legislation at the
<BR>
state level.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That the concepts of disclosure and limitation of election campaign
<BR>
financing are established by the passage of the Federal Election Campaign
<BR>
Act of 1971 by the Congress of the United States, and in consequence thereof
<BR>
it is desirable to have implementing legislation at the state level.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) That small contributions by individual contributors are to be
<BR>
encouraged, and that not requiring the reporting of small contributions may
<BR>
tend to encourage such contributions.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the public's right to know of the financing of political
<BR>
campaigns and lobbying and the financial affairs of elected officials and
<BR>
candidates far outweighs any right that these matters remain secret and
<BR>
private.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) That, mindful of the right of individuals to privacy and of the
<BR>
desirability of the efficient administration of government, full access to
<BR>
information concerning the conduct of government on every level must be
<BR>
assured as a fundamental and necessary precondition to the sound governance
<BR>
of a free society.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote
<BR>
complete disclosure of all information respecting the financing of political
<BR>
campaigns and lobbying, and the financial affairs of elected officials and
<BR>
candidates, and full access to public records so as to assure continuing
<BR>
public confidence of fairness of elections and governmental processes, and
<BR>
so as to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In
<BR>
promoting such complete disclosure, however, this chapter shall be enforced
<BR>
so as to insure that the information disclosed will not be misused for
<BR>
arbitrary and capricious purposes and to insure that all persons reporting
<BR>
under this chapter will be protected from harassment and unfounded
<BR>
allegations based on information they have freely disclosed.

</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the public disclosure act (this chapter 42.17) is to inform

<P><EM>&gt;3. Liberal construction
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote its purposes, the public records act's provisions are
<BR>
to be liberally construed to promote full access to public records; its
<BR>
exemptions are to be narrowly interpreted.  Confederated Tribes of Chehalis
<BR>
Reservation v. Johnson (1998) &gt; 135 Wash.2d 734, 958 P.2d 260.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public disclosure act is to be construed liberally to promote complete
<BR>
disclosure, and exceptions to disclosure requirement are construed narrowly.

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a strongly worded mandate for broad disclosure of public records, Public
<BR>
Disclosure Act is to be liberally construed to promote full access to public
<BR>
records, and its exemptions are to be narrowly construed.  Amren v. City of
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;3.5.  Duty to disclose
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Disclosure Act mandates disclosure in four areas of government,
<BR>
namely:  campaign financing;  lobbyist reporting;  reporting of elected
<BR>
officials' financial affairs;  and public records.  Servais v. Port of
<BR>
Bellingham (1995) &gt; 127 Wash.2d 820, 904 P.2d 1124.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure statutes establish positive duty to disclose public records
<BR>
unless they fall within specific exemptions.  Cowles Pub. Co. v. City of
<BR>
Spokane (1993) &gt; 69 Wash.App. 678, 849 P.2d 1271, review denied &gt; 122
<BR>
Wash.2d 1013, 863 P.2d 73.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;4. Limitations on right of privacy, in general
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public's entitlement to know of sources and magnitude of financial and
<BR>
persuasional influences on government is limited to the information required
<BR>
in the Public Disclosure Act.  Seeber v. Washington State Public Disclosure
<BR>
Commission (1981) &gt; 96 Wash.2d 135, 634 P.2d 303.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some intimate personal details about an elected official or a
<BR>
candidate for elective office may be beyond the scope of legitimate public
<BR>
interest, any information bearing on his fitness for office must be
<BR>
considered in the public domain and as such, a limitation on the right to
<BR>
privacy of such an official or candidate.  Fritz v. Gorton (1974) &gt; 83
<BR>
Wash.2d 275, 517 P.2d 911, appeal dismissed 94 S.Ct. 2596, 417 U.S. 902, 41
<BR>
L.Ed.2d 208.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an essential corollary of freedom of speech, the public's right to
<BR>
receive information concerning the fitness or qualification of an elected
<BR>
official or candidate for public office operates over a broad scope and is
<BR>
superior to such an officer's or candidate's right to privacy.  Fritz v.
<BR>
Gorton (1974) &gt; 83 Wash.2d 275, 517 P.2d 911, appeal dismissed 94 S.Ct.
<BR>
2596, 417 U.S. 902, 41 L.Ed.2d 208.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diet information forms submitted to Department of Health pursuant to
<BR>
federal/state program, and computer analyses generated with information
<BR>
provided, contain personal information which is exempt from public
<BR>
inspection and copying;  if this personal information is deleted, the
<BR>
remainder of the records are subject to public disclosure.  Op.
<BR>
Atty.Gen.1997, No. 2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;5. Superior executive officers
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commissioners of public disclosure commission and their chief
<BR>
administrative officer are &quot;superior executive officers&quot; of the state whose
<BR>
actions in releasing to news media names of candidates for public office who
<BR>
had failed to comply with public disclosure law had more than tenuous
<BR>
relation to their official duties;  therefore, their release of information
<BR>
to media indicating that candidate for public office had not complied with
<BR>
disclosure law was absolutely privileged.  Sidor v. Public Disclosure
<BR>
Commission (1980) &gt; 25 Wash.App. 127, 607 P.2d 859, review denied.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;6. Appearance of fairness
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations of ex parte contacts with corporation's officials and campaign
<BR>
contributions from corporation's employees to two council members who
<BR>
sponsored and pushed for revision of ordinance to allow corporation's
<BR>
construction of office building did not raise appearance of fairness issue.

<BR>
634 P.2d 862.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;7. Lobbyists
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Disclosure Act (this chapter) which stated that state public
<BR>
disclosure commission could compel candidates, public officials, campaign
<BR>
committees and lobbyists' employers to divulge whatever information was
<BR>
deemed necessary to carry out purposes of the act as the commission was to
<BR>
by rule prescribe but which did not contain similar rule-making provisions
<BR>
in regard to obtaining of additional information from lobbyists, did not
<BR>
authorize commission to require lobbyist to divulge any information other
<BR>
than the information specified within the act.  Seeber v. Washington State
<BR>
Public Disclosure Commission (1981) &gt; 96 Wash.2d 135, 634 P.2d 303.
<BR>
<P>Sec. 552. Public information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records, and
<BR>
proceedings
<BR>
<P>(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows:
<BR>
(1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal
<BR>
Register for the guidance of the public -
<BR>
(A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the
<BR>
established places at which, the employees (and in the case of a
<BR>
uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the methods
<BR>
whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or
<BR>
requests, or obtain decisions;
<BR>
(B) statements of the general course and method by which its
<BR>
functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and
<BR>
requirements of all formal and informal procedures available;
<BR>
(C) rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the
<BR>
places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the
<BR>
scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations;
<BR>
(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as
<BR>
authorized by law, and statements of general policy or
<BR>
interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted
<BR>
by the agency; and
<BR>
(E) each amendment, revision, or repeal of the foregoing. Except to the
<BR>
extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof, a
<BR>
person may not in any manner be required to resort to, or be adversely
<BR>
affected by, a matter required to be published in the Federal Register and
<BR>
not so published. For the purpose of this paragraph, matter reasonably
<BR>
available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed published in
<BR>
the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein with the
<BR>
approval of the Director of the Federal Register.
<BR>
(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available
<BR>
for public inspection and copying -
<BR>
(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting
<BR>
opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;
<BR>
(B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have
<BR>
been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal
<BR>
Register;
<BR>
(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that
<BR>
affect a member of the public;
<BR>
(D) copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which
<BR>
have been released to any person under paragraph (3) and which,
<BR>
because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency
<BR>
determines have become or are likely to become the subject of
<BR>
subsequent requests for substantially the same records; and
<BR>
(E) a general index of the records referred to under
<BR>
subparagraph (D); unless the materials are promptly published and copies
<BR>
offered for sale. For records created on or after November 1, 1996, within
<BR>
one year after such date, each agency shall make such records available,
<BR>
including by computer telecommunications or, if computer telecommunications
<BR>
means have not been established by the agency, by other electronic means. To
<BR>
the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
<BR>
privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or
<BR>
publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, staff manual,
<BR>
instruction, or copies of records referred to in subparagraph (D). However,
<BR>
in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in
<BR>
writing, and the extent of such deletion shall be indicated on the portion
<BR>
of the record which is made available or published, unless including that
<BR>
indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in subsection
<BR>
(b) under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the extent of
<BR>
the deletion shall be indicated at the place in the record where the
<BR>
deletion was made. Each agency shall also maintain and make available for
<BR>
public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying
<BR>
information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated
<BR>
after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be made available or
<BR>
published. Each agency shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently,
<BR>
and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplements
<BR>
thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal Register that
<BR>
the publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the
<BR>
agency shall nonetheless provide copies of such index on request at a cost
<BR>
not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. Each agency shall make the
<BR>
index referred to in subparagraph (E) available by computer
<BR>
telecommunications by December 31, 1999. A final order, opinion, statement
<BR>
of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects a
<BR>
member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an
<BR>
agency against a party other than an agency only if -
<BR>
(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published
<BR>
as provided by this paragraph; or
<BR>
(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms
<BR>
thereof.
<BR>
(3)
<BR>
(A) Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1)
<BR>
and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request for records which
<BR>
(i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with
<BR>
published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be
<BR>
followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.
<BR>
(B) In making any record available to a person under this paragraph, an
<BR>
agency shall provide the record in any form or format requested by the
<BR>
person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or
<BR>
format. Each agency shall make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in
<BR>
forms or formats that are reproducible for purposes of this section.
<BR>
(C) In responding under this paragraph to a request for records, an agency
<BR>
shall make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form
<BR>
or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the
<BR>
operation of the agency's automated information system.
<BR>
(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ''search'' means to review,
<BR>
manually or by automated means, agency records for the purpose of locating
<BR>
those records which are responsive to a request.
<BR>
(4)
<BR>
(A)
<BR>
(i) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency shall
<BR>
promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment,
<BR>
specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the processing of requests
<BR>
under this section and establishing procedures and guidelines for
<BR>
determining when such fees should be waived or reduced. Such schedule shall
<BR>
conform to the guidelines which shall be promulgated, pursuant to notice and
<BR>
receipt of public comment, by the Director of the Office of Management and
<BR>
Budget and which shall provide for a uniform schedule of fees for all
<BR>
agencies.
<BR>
(ii) Such agency regulations shall provide that -
<BR>
(I) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for
<BR>
document search, duplication, and review, when records are
<BR>
requested for commercial use;
<BR>
(II) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for
<BR>
document duplication when records are not sought for commercial
<BR>
use and the request is made by an educational or noncommercial
<BR>
scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific
<BR>
research; or a representative of the news media; and
<BR>
(III) for any request not described in (I) or (II), fees shall
<BR>
be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and
<BR>
duplication.
<BR>
(iii) Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced
<BR>
below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of the
<BR>
information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
<BR>
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the
<BR>
government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
<BR>
(iv) Fee schedules shall provide for the recovery of only the direct costs
<BR>
of search, duplication, or review. Review costs shall include only the
<BR>
direct costs incurred during the initial examination of a document for the
<BR>
purposes of determining whether the documents must be disclosed under this
<BR>
section and for the purposes of withholding any portions exempt from
<BR>
disclosure under this section. Review costs may not include any costs
<BR>
incurred in resolving issues of law or policy that may be raised in the
<BR>
course of processing a request under this section. No fee may be charged by
<BR>
any agency under this section -
<BR>
(I) if the costs of routine collection and processing of the
<BR>
fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee; or
<BR>
(II) for any request described in clause (ii) (II) or (III) of
<BR>
this subparagraph for the first two hours of search time or for
<BR>
the first one hundred pages of duplication.
<BR>
(v) No agency may require advance payment of any fee unless the requester
<BR>
has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, or the agency has
<BR>
determined that the fee will exceed $250.
<BR>
(vi) Nothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a
<BR>
statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular
<BR>
types of records.
<BR>
(vii) In any action by a requester regarding the waiver of fees under this
<BR>
section, the court shall determine the matter de novo: Provided, That the
<BR>
court's review of the matter shall be limited to the record before the
<BR>
agency.
<BR>
(B) On complaint, the district court of the United States in the district in
<BR>
which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in
<BR>
which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, has
<BR>
jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to
<BR>
order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the
<BR>
complainant. In such a case the court shall determine the matter de novo,
<BR>
and may examine the contents of such agency records in camera to determine
<BR>
whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the
<BR>
exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section, and the burden is on
<BR>
the agency to sustain its action. In addition to any other matters to which
<BR>
a court accords substantial weight, a court shall accord substantial weight
<BR>
to an affidavit of an agency concerning the agency's determination as to
<BR>
technical feasibility under paragraph (2)(C) and subsection (b) and
<BR>
reproducibility under paragraph (3)(B).
<BR>
(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the defendant shall serve an
<BR>
answer or otherwise plead to any complaint made under this subsection within
<BR>
thirty days after service upon the defendant of the pleading in which such
<BR>
complaint is made, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause shown.
<BR>
(D) Repealed. Pub. L. 98-620, title IV, Sec. 402(2), Nov. 8, 1984, 98 Stat.
<BR>
3357.)
<BR>
(E) The court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees
<BR>
and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this
<BR>
section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.
<BR>
(F) Whenever the court orders the production of any agency records
<BR>
improperly withheld from the complainant and assesses against the United
<BR>
States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs, and the court
<BR>
additionally issues a written finding that the circumstances surrounding the
<BR>
withholding raise questions whether agency personnel acted arbitrarily or
<BR>
capriciously with respect to the withholding, the Special Counsel shall
<BR>
promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is
<BR>
warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for
<BR>
the withholding. The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration
<BR>
of the evidence submitted, shall submit his findings and recommendations to
<BR>
the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies
<BR>
of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or his
<BR>
representative. The administrative authority shall take the corrective
<BR>
action that the Special Counsel recommends.
<BR>
(G) In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the district
<BR>
court may punish for contempt the responsible employee, and in the case of a
<BR>
uniformed service, the responsible member.
<BR>
(5) Each agency having more than one member shall maintain and make
<BR>
available for public inspection a record of the final votes of each member
<BR>
in every agency proceeding.
<BR>
(6)
<BR>
(A) Each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph (1), (2),
<BR>
or (3) of this subsection, shall -
<BR>
(i) determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and
<BR>
legal public holidays) after the receipt of any such request
<BR>
whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify
<BR>
the person making such request of such determination and the
<BR>
reasons therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to
<BR>
the head of the agency any adverse determination; and
<BR>
(ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within
<BR>
twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public
<BR>
holidays) after the receipt of such appeal. If on appeal the
<BR>
denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld,
<BR>
the agency shall notify the person making such request of the
<BR>
provisions for judicial review of that determination under
<BR>
paragraph (4) of this subsection.
<BR>
(B)
<BR>
(i) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time
<BR>
limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of subparagraph (A)
<BR>
may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting
<BR>
forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date on which a
<BR>
determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a
<BR>
date that would result in an extension for more than ten working days,
<BR>
except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph.
<BR>
(ii) With respect to a request for which a written notice under clause (i)
<BR>
extends the time limits prescribed under clause (i) of subparagraph (A), the
<BR>
agency shall notify the person making the request if the request cannot be
<BR>
processed within the time limit specified in that clause and shall provide
<BR>
the person an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may
<BR>
be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the
<BR>
agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified
<BR>
request. Refusal by the person to reasonably modify the request or arrange
<BR>
such an alternative time frame shall be considered as a factor in
<BR>
determining whether exceptional circumstances exist for purposes of
<BR>
subparagraph (C).
<BR>
(iii) As used in this subparagraph, ''unusual circumstances'' means, but
<BR>
only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the
<BR>
particular requests -
<BR>
(I) the need to search for and collect the requested records
<BR>
from field facilities or other establishments that are separate
<BR>
from the office processing the request;
<BR>
(II) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine
<BR>
a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are
<BR>
demanded in a single request; or
<BR>
(III) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with
<BR>
all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial
<BR>
interest in the determination of the request or among two or more
<BR>
components of the agency having substantial subject-matter
<BR>
interest therein.
<BR>
(iv) Each agency may promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt
<BR>
of public comment, providing for the aggregation of certain requests by the
<BR>
same requestor, or by a group of requestors acting in concert, if the agency
<BR>
reasonably believes that such requests actually constitute a single request,
<BR>
which would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in this
<BR>
subparagraph, and the requests involve clearly related matters. Multiple
<BR>
requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.
<BR>
(C)
<BR>
(i) Any person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph
<BR>
(1), (2), or (3) of this subsection shall be deemed to have exhausted his
<BR>
administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to
<BR>
comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph. If the
<BR>
Government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is
<BR>
exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain
<BR>
jurisdiction and allow the agency additional time to complete its review of
<BR>
the records. Upon any determination by an agency to comply with a request
<BR>
for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person
<BR>
making such request. Any notification of denial of any request for records
<BR>
under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of
<BR>
each person responsible for the denial of such request.
<BR>
(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ''exceptional
<BR>
circumstances'' does not include a delay that results from a predictable
<BR>
agency workload of requests under this section, unless the agency
<BR>
demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending
<BR>
requests.
<BR>
(iii) Refusal by a person to reasonably modify the scope of a request or
<BR>
arrange an alternative time frame for processing a request (or a modified
<BR>
request) under clause (ii) after being given an opportunity to do so by the
<BR>
agency to whom the person made the request shall be considered as a factor
<BR>
in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist for purposes of this
<BR>
subparagraph.
<BR>
(D)
<BR>
(i) Each agency may promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt
<BR>
of public comment, providing for multitrack processing of requests for
<BR>
records based on the amount of work or time (or both) involved in processing
<BR>
requests.
<BR>
(ii) Regulations under this subparagraph may provide a person making a
<BR>
request that does not qualify for the fastest multitrack processing an
<BR>
opportunity to limit the scope of the request in order to qualify for faster
<BR>
processing.
<BR>
(iii) This subparagraph shall not be considered to affect the requirement
<BR>
under subparagraph (C) to exercise due diligence.
<BR>
(E)
<BR>
(i) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt
<BR>
of public comment, providing for expedited processing of requests for
<BR>
records -
<BR>
(I) in cases in which the person requesting the records
<BR>
demonstrates a compelling need; and
<BR>
(II) in other cases determined by the agency.
<BR>
(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), regulations under this subparagraph must
<BR>
ensure -
<BR>
(I) that a determination of whether to provide expedited
<BR>
processing shall be made, and notice of the determination shall
<BR>
be provided to the person making the request, within 10 days
<BR>
after the date of the request; and
<BR>
(II) expeditious consideration of administrative appeals of
<BR>
such determinations of whether to provide expedited processing.
<BR>
(iii) An agency shall process as soon as practicable any request for records
<BR>
to which the agency has granted expedited processing under this
<BR>
subparagraph. Agency action to deny or affirm denial of a request for
<BR>
expedited processing pursuant to this subparagraph, and failure by an agency
<BR>
to respond in a timely manner to such a request shall be subject to judicial
<BR>
review under paragraph (4), except that the judicial review shall be based
<BR>
on the record before the agency at the time of the determination.
<BR>
(iv) A district court of the United States shall not have jurisdiction to
<BR>
review an agency denial of expedited processing of a request for records
<BR>
after the agency has provided a complete response to the request.
<BR>
(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ''compelling need'' means -
<BR>
(I) that a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited
<BR>
basis under this paragraph could reasonably be expected to pose
<BR>
an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an
<BR>
individual; or
<BR>
(II) with respect to a request made by a person primarily
<BR>
engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the
<BR>
public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
<BR>
(vi) A demonstration of a compelling need by a person making a request for
<BR>
expedited processing shall be made by a statement certified by such person
<BR>
to be true and correct to the best of such person's knowledge and belief.
<BR>
(F) In denying a request for records, in whole or in part, an agency shall
<BR>
make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any requested matter the
<BR>
provision of which is denied, and shall provide any such estimate to the
<BR>
person making the request, unless providing such estimate would harm an
<BR>
interest protected by the exemption in subsection (b) pursuant to which the
<BR>
denial is made.
<BR>
(b) This section does not apply to matters that are -
<BR>
(1)
<BR>
(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an
<BR>
Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national
<BR>
defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified
<BR>
pursuant to such Executive order;
<BR>
(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and
<BR>
practices of an agency;
<BR>
(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other
<BR>
than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A)
<BR>
requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a
<BR>
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes
<BR>
particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types
<BR>
of matters to be withheld;
<BR>
(4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information
<BR>
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
<BR>
(5) inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which
<BR>
would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in
<BR>
litigation with the agency;
<BR>
(6) personnel and medical files and similar files the
<BR>
disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted
<BR>
invasion of personal privacy;
<BR>
(7) records or information compiled for law enforcement
<BR>
purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law
<BR>
enforcement records or information (A) could reasonably be
<BR>
expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) would
<BR>
deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial
<BR>
adjudication, (C) could reasonably be expected to constitute an
<BR>
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) could reasonably be
<BR>
expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source,
<BR>
including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any
<BR>
private institution which furnished information on a confidential
<BR>
basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by
<BR>
criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal
<BR>
investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national
<BR>
security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a
<BR>
confidential source, (E) would disclose techniques and procedures
<BR>
for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would
<BR>
disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or
<BR>
prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to
<BR>
risk circumvention of the law, or (F) could reasonably be
<BR>
expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any
<BR>
individual;
<BR>
(8) contained in or related to examination, operating, or
<BR>
condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an
<BR>
agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial
<BR>
institutions; or
<BR>
(9) geological and geophysical information and data, including
<BR>
maps, concerning wells. Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall
<BR>
be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the
<BR>
portions which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information
<BR>
deleted shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless
<BR>
including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption
<BR>
in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically
<BR>
feasible, the amount of the information deleted shall be indicated at the
<BR>
place in the record where such deletion is made.
<BR>
(c)
<BR>
(1) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in
<BR>
subsection (b)(7)(A) and -
<BR>
(A) the investigation or proceeding involves a possible
<BR>
violation of criminal law; and
<BR>
(B) there is reason to believe that (i) the subject of the
<BR>
investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and
<BR>
(ii) disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably
<BR>
be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the agency may,
<BR>
during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as
<BR>
not subject to the requirements of this section.
<BR>
(2) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law enforcement
<BR>
agency under an informant's name or personal identifier are requested by a
<BR>
third party according to the informant's name or personal identifier, the
<BR>
agency may treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this
<BR>
section unless the informant's status as an informant has been officially
<BR>
confirmed.
<BR>
(3) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records maintained
<BR>
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pertaining to foreign intelligence or
<BR>
counterintelligence, or international terrorism, and the existence of the
<BR>
records is classified information as provided in subsection (b)(1), the
<BR>
Bureau may, as long as the existence of the records remains classified
<BR>
information, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this
<BR>
section.
<BR>
(d) This section does not authorize withholding of information or limit the
<BR>
availability of records to the public, except as specifically stated in this
<BR>
section. This section is not authority to withhold information from
<BR>
Congress.
<BR>
