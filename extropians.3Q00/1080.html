<EM>&gt; a long time ago.  Actual measurements are infinitely superior to pretty

</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm fairly new to the list, so hopefully not too much of this has
<BR>
been brought up before.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual measurements need to be checked more thoroughly though.
<BR>
The original study which threw this into mainstream media was done by a
<BR>
self-proclaimed obscure molecular genetecist named Dean Hamer.  It was
<BR>
also conveniently done at the same time that Bill Clinton was levying for
<BR>
gays in the military (not that genetics should have had anything to do
<BR>
with this issue).  It was done over 40 gay brothers (I didn't read that
<BR>
they were twins, but they could have been), which means 50% would only be
<BR>
twenty cases.  Some how he miraculously concluded from this that at the
<BR>
tip of the X-chromosone there is Xq28 which causes homosexuality in males.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A follow-up study was supposedly done in 1999 which suggested a
<BR>
much less correlation, but I unfortunately don't have any information on
<BR>
this.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamer failed to check to see if that same gene was in non-gay
<BR>
brothers, or for that matter in other gay men.  There's also the case that
<BR>
if it were twins, they would have grown up in the same environment as
<BR>
eachother.  A better study would be twins separated at birth, one turns
<BR>
out gay...check the other one.  Not an easy study to do though.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the study correct, the gene still could be one of a more
<BR>
effeminate emotional state as well.  It gives no explanation for
<BR>
bi-sexuals, different fetishes, and sexual deviants.  Would you suggest
<BR>
that someone who's into S&amp;M is afected genetically?  I'm assuming most
<BR>
people wouldn't, in which case why would you suggest this for
<BR>
homosexuality, or for that matter heterosexuality...other than purely
<BR>
mating purposes?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more empirical data, a friend who watches loveline a lot, was
<BR>
telling me that every time someone comes on and is gay, bi, or anything
<BR>
slightly less ordinary, they ask them why they became this way.  They
<BR>
always seem to answer with some crazy event in their life.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's fairly obvious that just like animals we're going to have
<BR>
some genetic tendency to mate, hence survival of species through
<BR>
reproduction.  But as far as what attracts us to those we chose is so
<BR>
easily trained into someone by their surroundings.  An example:  they
<BR>
claim that each race when first introduced to a different one, tends to
<BR>
look at the other in some disgust because, yes genetically, we're
<BR>
prgrammed to not want to mix breed (This was in that same article
<BR>
someone referred to about symmetry of faces...it was in Discover
<BR>
magazine, February 2000 for those of you curious).  History has plenty of
<BR>
evidence of this.  Yet every caucasian person I know who grew up near
<BR>
african-american neighborhoods seems to be much more attracted to
<BR>
african-americans.  Genetics should in all theory be fighting this.
