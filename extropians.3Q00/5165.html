<EM>&gt; Firstly, all this &quot;mysticism&quot; stuff. Gag me with a spoon! Special spiritual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insight, grokking the nature of reality; where does that really get you? You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel like it does something positive, but I think it's really just feelgood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crud; I'd say you'd be hard pressed to show any measurable benefit of such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; epiphany. It sounds suspiciously like the idea of psychedelic drugs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;expanding your consciousness&quot;. The idea appeals (at least under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence of them, as far as I recall), but it's pretty much meaningless in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any tangible context. In the end, this stuff is the enemy of rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought, basically by definition.
</EM><BR>
<P>This far, I mostly agree...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Secondly, and more importantly; this idea of building God for ourselves is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; downright dangerous. The god meme has appeal; it's nice to believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's a point to the universe, after all (delusional as that may be). By
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extension, when you decide there isn't a God (or a Sysop), then it can seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a good idea to make one, or become one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What does that mean, though? If you are going to build a do-it-yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guardian (in the sense of Plato - it was Plato, wasn't it?) then I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's bad news; the best outcome we can hope for is failure. It's also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bloody arrogant.
</EM><BR>
<P>How so?  Was it arrogant, and the best that people could hope for was
<BR>
failure, when [insert spectacularly sucessful and revolutionary
<BR>
engineering project of choice here *]?  Ok, granted, maybe there was
<BR>
some arrogance, but it did not fail...
<BR>
<P>(* Something on the order of the Apollo missions, the Wright Brothers'
<BR>
airplane, and/or the eradication of smallpox.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you are going to become one, you either envisage being such a guardian,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or maybe raising everyone up to equal status. In the guardian case, the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguments apply as above. In the egalitarian case, where is godhood? It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more powerful beings, sure, but a society of such. So the concept of God is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not useful in that context.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, actually it is useful.  The concept of God defines a target for one
<BR>
to reach towards, while one is reaching.  Granted, the concept may still
<BR>
seem out of reach when one decides to reach elsewhere, but in the mean
<BR>
time, one has progressed enough that more things can be reached for.
<BR>
(Put another way: just because one trillion units of value - money,
<BR>
intellect, energy, years in average lifespan, et cetera - is not an
<BR>
infinite amount of such, that does not mean that starting with one
<BR>
hundred and obtaining one trillion is necessarily useless, nor does it
<BR>
mean that one trillion can only be put to the same types of uses as one
<BR>
hundred.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Basically, the concept of God is all about authority, control, dominance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The ideas of benign rule, divine right, perfection. If you have any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individualist streak, these are anathema.
</EM><BR>
<P>One concept of God, yes.  Is it so wrong, in and of itself, to have
<BR>
control over more non-sentient resources than one currently does?  (Many
<BR>
means of achieving said control may be questionable, but I'm asking
<BR>
about the control itself.  I also freely acknowledge ducking the issue
<BR>
of lording over other people...but, in many versions of God, mankind's
<BR>
free will makes humans the one thing God can not absolutely control.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Gods will not help us where we are going. But they could seriously stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things up.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I build a God, and what I have created lifts me up to be a trans-it,
<BR>
that I might in turn lift it up even higher, and so on in a never-ending
<BR>
cycle, does that not count as helping?
