YOUR PAPERS, PLEASE ...
<BR>
Human ID implant to be unveiled soon
<BR>
'Wearers' of Digital Angel' monitored by GPS, Internet
<BR>
by JoAnn Kohlbrand &lt;BR&gt;and Julie Foster
<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>A working prototype of an implant designed to monitor the
<BR>
physiology and whereabouts of human wearers, known as Digital
<BR>
Angel, is scheduled to be unveiled in October at an
<BR>
invitation-only event in New York City -- two months ahead of
<BR>
schedule.
<BR>
<P>Developed by  Applied Digital Solutions, the device is said to
<BR>
be the first-ever operational combination of bio-sensor
<BR>
technology and Web-enabled wireless telecommunications linked
<BR>
to global positioning satellite location-tracking systems.
<BR>
<P>Applied Digital Solutions Chairman Richard Sullivan said the
<BR>
development of the technology has progressed well ahead of
<BR>
schedule.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We're extremely heartened by the remarkable progress made by
<BR>
Dr. Peter Zhou and his entire research team, including
<BR>
professors and their associates at Princeton University and the
<BR>
New Jersey Institute of Technology,&quot; said Sullivan. &quot;This
<BR>
technology relates directly to the exploding wireless
<BR>
marketplace. We'll be demonstrating for the first time ever
<BR>
that wireless telecommunications systems and bio-sensor devices
<BR>
-- capable of measuring and transmitting critical body function
<BR>
data -- can be successfully linked together with GPS (global
<BR>
positioning satellite) technology and integrated with the
<BR>
Internet.&quot;
<BR>
<P>As previously reported in WorldNetDaily, Digital Angel is
<BR>
intended to serve a number of functions. In addition to
<BR>
locating missing persons and monitoring physiological data, the
<BR>
device will be marketed to the world of e-commerce as a means
<BR>
of verifying online consumer identity.
<BR>
<P>Similar to microchip technologies currently used as  electronic
<BR>
ID tags for pets, Digital Angel is a dime-sized implant,
<BR>
inserted just under the skin. When implanted within a human
<BR>
body, the device is powered electromechanically through the
<BR>
movement of muscles and can be activated either by the &quot;wearer&quot;
<BR>
or by a monitoring facility.
<BR>
<P>Applied Digital Solutions is also exploring avenues for
<BR>
utilizing Digital Angel without implanting it.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We are currently talking to a watch maker who is interested in
<BR>
placing the device on the back of their watches,&quot; Sullivan told
<BR>
WorldNetDaily. &quot;In addition, technology is being developed that
<BR>
would allow Digital Angel to function from the back of a
<BR>
cellular phone, transmitting bio-sensor information when
<BR>
carried by the user.&quot;
<BR>
<P>While estimates of Digital Angel's marketplace potential vary,
<BR>
Sullivan and Applied Digital's partners believe they can enter
<BR>
the implant into a multi-billion dollar market through various
<BR>
licensing arrangements, Web-enabled wireless services and data
<BR>
transactions handled by Applied Digital's Application Service
<BR>
Provider center.
<BR>
<P>Those attending the event in New York City will see a working,
<BR>
multimedia demonstration of the implant. A miniature sensor
<BR>
device -- smaller than a grain of rice and equipped with a tiny
<BR>
antenna -- will capture and wirelessly transmit a person's
<BR>
vital body-function data, such as body temperature or pulse, to
<BR>
an Internet-integrated ground station. In addition, the antenna
<BR>
will also receive information regarding the location of the
<BR>
individual from the GPS satellite. Both sets of data -- medical
<BR>
information and location -- will then be wirelessly transmitted
<BR>
to the ground station and made available on Web-enabled
<BR>
desktop, laptop or wireless devices.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>According to Applied Digital, the demonstration will represent
<BR>
the first time these technologies have been united into one
<BR>
functioning system.
<BR>
<P>The New York event -- at a time, date and location to be
<BR>
announced later -- will feature live presentations from top
<BR>
Applied Digital executives, including Sullivan and Dr. Peter
<BR>
Zhou, president and chief scientist at DigitalAngel.net, Inc.,
<BR>
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Applied Digital. Attendees at the
<BR>
device's unveiling ceremony will include a handpicked group of
<BR>
potential joint-venture partners, as well as senior-level
<BR>
players in the e-commerce, wireless and Internet industries,
<BR>
and stock analysts.
<BR>
<P>Zhou is passionately enthusiastic about the device.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I'm particularly excited about Digital Angel's ability to save
<BR>
lives by remotely monitoring the medical conditions of at-risk
<BR>
patients and providing emergency rescue units with the person's
<BR>
exact location,&quot; he said. &quot;I also see great potential for
<BR>
Digital Angel in the area of 'location-aware' e-commerce. This
<BR>
is a whole new wireless and Web-enabled frontier in which a
<BR>
purchaser's actual location is integral to making a successful
<BR>
sale or providing a valuable, location-critical service.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In an exclusive interview with WorldNetDaily in March, Zhou
<BR>
expressed his belief that the implant will be as popular as
<BR>
cell phones and vaccines.
<BR>
<P>Digital Angel, said Zhou, &quot;will be a connection from yourself to
<BR>
the electronic world. It will be your guardian, protector. It
<BR>
will bring good things to you.&quot;
<BR>
<P>He added, &quot;We will be a hybrid of electronic intelligence and
<BR>
our own soul.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Applied Digital Solutions first announced it had acquired the
<BR>
patent rights to a miniature digital transceiver in December
<BR>
1999. Naming the device Digital Angel, ADS formed
<BR>
DigitalAngel.net, Inc. to serve as the research and development
<BR>
unit for the device. Since that time, ADS has actively promoted
<BR>
the implant, pointing to what executives and scientists say are
<BR>
lifestyle benefits of the chip.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The first market we hope to tap into is a $10 billion
<BR>
agri-industry,&quot; said Sullivan. &quot;The FDA is requiring improved
<BR>
tracking methods for beef and poultry. The Digital Angel, with
<BR>
its ability to monitor body functions, can track quality from
<BR>
the [animal] pens to the supermarket.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The next large market ADS hopes to tap into is that of
<BR>
preventive medical tracking. Through its body function tracking
<BR>
capabilities, the Digital Angel can monitor such functions as
<BR>
body temperature, heartbeat and specific needs such as insulin
<BR>
levels. This information can then be transmitted to a doctor or
<BR>
health-care provider.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The Digital Angel serves as an advance warning device, which
<BR>
can help lower the cost of medical care,&quot; commented Sullivan.
<BR>
<P>However, despite the excitement over an early working model of
<BR>
this new technology, concerns have been raised as to personal
<BR>
privacy. With the integrated technology, a person's location,
<BR>
health status and other personal data will be transmitted and
<BR>
available via the Internet.
<BR>
<P>ADS claims, however, that privacy concerns are misplaced, since
<BR>
the device can be turned off by the owner.
<BR>
<P>Additional concerns have been raised by Christians, who contend
<BR>
Digital Angel could be the fulfillment of a  biblical
<BR>
prediction found in the book of Revelation.
<BR>
<P>Zhou, president of DigitalAngel.net, Inc., disagrees.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I am a Christian, but I don't think [that argument] makes
<BR>
sense,&quot; he told WND in March. &quot;The purpose of the device is to
<BR>
save your life and improve the quality of life. There's no
<BR>
connection to the Bible.&quot;
<BR>
<P>As the technology becomes more commonplace, the debate, as well
<BR>
as sales, are likely to continue growing.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We'll soon be ready to move ahead to the production-design
<BR>
phase of Digital Angel geared to specific marketplace
<BR>
applications,&quot; Sullivan said. &quot;The key message right now is
<BR>
this: Digital Angel isn't a blue-sky technology. This is real.
<BR>
Digital Angel breakthrough technology is here. It's live!&quot;
