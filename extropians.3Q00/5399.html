<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Candidate: Socialists a mainstream party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Many who answer Web survey say their views are more like Socialist's than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Gore's, Bush's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Heh.  McReynolds has staked out a nice bland middle, unlike Bush
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pandering to the religious right, and Gore pandering to the NEA &amp; big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labor.  I took the test, and of course matched Harry Browne.  I was more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amused to score 100% Humanist on the religion selector- and zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreement with Jehovah's Witnesses.  Nothing I didn't know already...
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's my results and the degree of concurrence with the candidates. IMHO, the
<BR>
only reason McReynolds is ahead of Gore is because Gore is for the Drug War and
<BR>
McReynolds is not.
<BR>
1. ABORTION ISSUES: Which views on the issue of abortion would you prefer your
<BR>
candidate advocate?  Neutral
<BR>
<P>2. MINORITY ISSUES: Would you prefer your candidate support or oppose such
<BR>
legislation as affirmative action?Strongly prefer Oppose
<BR>
<P>3. CAMPAIGN FINANCE: Would you prefer your candidate support or oppose campaign
<BR>
finance reform?  Stronglyprefer Oppose Reform (Lift restrictions on
<BR>
contributions)
<BR>
<P>4. CRIME: Some candidates have outlined their approach to minimizing crime. 
<BR>
Which approach do you prefer your candidate stress?  Strongly prefer &quot;get tough&quot;
<BR>
approach, e.g. longer prison sentences
<BR>
<P>5. DEFENSE SPENDING: Would you prefer your candidate advocate an increase or
<BR>
decrease in the defense spending budget?  Strongly prefer Increase
<BR>
<P>6. DRUG POLICY: Some presidential candidates support an increase in drug crime
<BR>
prosecution and penalties while some favor a decriminalization or complete
<BR>
legalization of what are currently drug crimes.  What stance would you like your
<BR>
candidate to adopt?  Strongly prefer support decriminalization
<BR>
<P>7. GAY RIGHTS: Some candidates believe that sexual orientation is an
<BR>
unchangeable characteristic and support across the board equality under civil
<BR>
law for gay and lesbian Americans.  On the other end of the spectrum, some
<BR>
believe that gay relationships are a destructive assault on the heterosexual,
<BR>
marriage-based family. What policies would you like your candidate to favor? 
<BR>
Somewhat support Legislative equality for homosexuals.
<BR>
<P>8. EDUCATION: Some presidential candidates support school choice.  Others see it
<BR>
as a separation of church and state issue.  What position would you like your
<BR>
candidate to support?  Strongly prefer School Choice
<BR>
<P>9. ENVIRONMENT: Which position regarding the environment would your ideal
<BR>
candidate advocate?  Somewhat prefer support the environment only after
<BR>
considering market and private property concerns.
<BR>
<P>10. EVOLUTION VS. CREATIONISM: Some presidential candidates favor the teaching
<BR>
of Creationism in public schools along evolution which is currently taught in
<BR>
science classes.  What's your opinion?  Strongly prefer the situation as it is
<BR>
now: evolution only
<BR>
<P>11. FOREIGN POLICY: Would you prefer your candidate embrace an
<BR>
non-interventionist or interventionist. Somewhat prefer non-interventionist
<BR>
<P>12. GUN CONTROL: Would you prefer your candidate oppose or support gun control
<BR>
legislation?  Strongly prefer Oppose
<BR>
<P>13. HEALTH CARE: Would you prefer your candidate support increased federal
<BR>
involvement in health care?  Or would you prefer health care be an area outside
<BR>
governmental control?  Strongly prefer health care as primarily the
<BR>
responsibility of the individual
<BR>
<P>14. MORAL ISSUES: Would you prefer your candidate favor federal, state and/or
<BR>
local legislation supporting &quot;traditional values&quot; such as advocating prayer in
<BR>
public schools, promoting teen-age sexual abstinence and restricting access to
<BR>
Internet pornography?  Somewhat prefer oppose legislation of&quot;traditional
<BR>
values&quot;.
<BR>
<P>15. SOCIAL SECURITY: Would you prefer your candidate promise to preserve or
<BR>
reform (including dismantle) Social Security?  Strongly prefer reforming
<BR>
<P>16. TAX POLICY: Various candidates have promised to overhaul the federal income
<BR>
tax codes.  They differ in how extreme the proposed changes would be.   Strongly
<BR>
support reforming or abolishing
<BR>
<P>17. TRADE ISSUES: Would you prefer your candidate be an advocate of free trade
<BR>
or trade controls like tariffs and embargoes?  Strongly prefer free-trade
<BR>
<P><P>Based on the above input, we have determined that the candidates match your
<BR>
viewpoints as represented by your answers in the following order:
<BR>
<P>#1:    Harry Browne  (75%)
<BR>
#2:    Alan Keyes  (70%)
<BR>
#3:    George W. Bush  (68%)
<BR>
#4:    Howard Phillips  (58%)
<BR>
#5:    John Hagelin  (51%)
<BR>
#6:    Patrick J. (Pat) Buchanan  (46%)
<BR>
#7:    David McReynolds  (30%)
<BR>
#8:    Albert Gore Jr.  (26%)
<BR>
#9:    Ralph Nader  (22%)
<BR>
<P>Its odd that there is such enmity between Hagelin and Buchanan, because there
<BR>
really is not that much difference between the two policy wise. I think Reform
<BR>
Party people hate Buchanan mostly for the same reasons the GOP dislikes David
<BR>
Duke.
