<P><EM>    &gt;puppy dogs and pussy cats have ample frequent litters, while humans

<EM>    &gt;tend only to have singletons
</EM><BR>
<P>The vast majority of species put their resources into having a large number
<BR>
of offspring. A small number of species, such as humans, have only a few
<BR>
offspring but considerable  resources  are used to ensure that  they actually
<BR>
make it into adulthood. In both strategies enormous energies are put into
<BR>
reproduction and that's a much better investment from evolution's point of
<BR>
view than immortality.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;It  needs to show exactly why different critters sharing the same indices
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;can  vary in lifespan by huge ratios - 1:10, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I once saw a plot of average body weight Vs average life expectancy of several
<BR>
hundred species, with one glaring exception it fit a straight line pretty well,
<BR>
usually the larger the species the longer it lived. Humans however were completely
<BR>
off the chart, they lived 4 or 5 times as long as you'd expect given their size.
<BR>
I've also heard that most mammals have about an equal number of heartbeats
<BR>
during their lifetime because small hearts beat faster, but human hearts beat many
<BR>
more times than any other animal. Evolution probably let us live longer because our
<BR>
children are helpless for such a long time.  And that probably happens because
<BR>
it takes a long time to learn how to use that big brain effectively, for that matter it
<BR>
takes a long time to even get a big brain, due to the small size of the birth canal,
<BR>
caused by bipedalism, the brain has a lot of growing to do after birth.
