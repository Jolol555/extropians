<EM>&gt; &gt; Natural, to be sure, in a Kuhnian sense... but to be kept in rein - if we

<EM>&gt; &gt; want to be good extropians.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Thank you. I couldn't have said any of it better than you did in your post.
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering what I think most or at least many of us think about the likes of
<BR>
Kuhn, thats a pretty meaningless statement. Bigotry is distain or hate that is
<BR>
not based on rational argument or actual facts. Hating individuals or groups who
<BR>
have in fact done heinous things, for example, is not bigotry, because it is
<BR>
factually well established why they are to be hated, no stereotypes or
<BR>
prejudices are involved. Hating individuals who are members of groups that have
<BR>
done heinous things in the past, but which they themselves as individuals have
<BR>
not done, and show no evidence of doing, is prejudicial, but it is also arguable
<BR>
that it is a prejudice with some merit, though not conclusive by any means. The
<BR>
more we know about such individuals allows us to better judge whether or not
<BR>
they are deserving of our distain.
<BR>
<P>What is natural is that, in accordance with the scientific principle, given
<BR>
enough examples of people in a certain group that do prove their right to our
<BR>
distain, it is natural for people to lend credence to rules about certain
<BR>
patterns (BTW: This is actually directly contradictory to Kuhn, who claims its a
<BR>
matter of class struggle).
<BR>
<P>So the questions to debate are:
<BR>
<P>Can ideas or opinions merit distain?
<BR>
Under what criteria do they properly earn distain?
<BR>
Are any people who espouse those ideas or opinions to be accorded the distain
<BR>
consistent with those ideas or opinions?
<BR>
Under what criteria are such people to be accorded that level of distain?
<BR>
<P>Now, Al, contrary to what you might think, I do have difficulty with the level
<BR>
of vehement distain that many people on the list have for anyone or anything
<BR>
spiritual, mystical, or religious. I have constrained my own statements here,
<BR>
for example, I say that in my experience, only some or many of the mystical
<BR>
people I know are know nothing zipperheads who don't like to think. I most
<BR>
explicitly did not say I think that all such people are.
