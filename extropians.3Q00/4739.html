<EM>&gt; Chaitin's paper is at the same time much better and much worse than I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was expecting.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you are talking about
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/vienna.html">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/vienna.html</A>?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Chaitin's paper relies heavily on an equation he's cooked up which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takes parameters.
</EM><BR>
<P>I felt that Chaitin's larger point was that axioms have a certain
<BR>
information content, and they simply can't prove theorems that have a
<BR>
larger information content.  As he put it, with five pounds of axioms
<BR>
you can't prove a ten pound theorem.  This suggests that mathematical
<BR>
truth may be much more complex than we imagined.
<BR>
<P>Prior to Godel it was suspected that with the right axioms you could prove
<BR>
everything that was true.  We now know this to be false.  Chaitin has
<BR>
taken Godel's result and made it quantitative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The relationship to epistemology, though, looks rather weak to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure that this has much relevance outside of mathematics (or
<BR>
perhaps meta-mathematics).  It challenges the fundamental axiomatic
<BR>
approach of mathematics and logic which goes back to the ancient Greeks.
<BR>
However Chaitin's suggestion that mathematics should become more of an
<BR>
engineering discipline has not been well received.  If mathematicians
<BR>
had wanted to be engineers they wouldn't have gone into math.
<BR>
<P>We use the phrase &quot;mathematical certainty&quot; as the highest degree
<BR>
of assurance possible.  Chaitin would challenge that by opening up
<BR>
mathematics to areas where no proofs are possible.  But math without
<BR>
proofs is arguably something different than math.
<BR>
<P>Chaitin has some hand-waving about possible connections between Godel's
<BR>
results and the uncertainty principle, or between his discovery of the
<BR>
essentially random nature of mathematics and the randomness in QM.
<BR>
However, the paradoxes of QM take on an entirely different hue when
<BR>
considered in light of many-worlds interpretations, where there is
<BR>
no randomness.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, Chaitin's theories can take on a different role there;
<BR>
Algorithmic Information Theory plays a key part in many-universe models
<BR>
that go beyond QM.  Wei Dai has a mailing list for exploring the notion
<BR>
that all universes exist, and that the &quot;measure&quot; or contribution of
<BR>
a universe is proportional to the algorithmic information content of
<BR>
that universe, by Chaitin's measure (others have also developed similar
<BR>
metrics).
<BR>
<P>There is an interesting paradox here; you'd think a universe starting
<BR>
with a certain information content could not generate anything which had
<BR>
a larger information content (a la Chaitin's results).  However, I don't
<BR>
think this is true; our own universe may have had almost zero information
<BR>
content but it generated us.  My explanation is that to single out a
<BR>
human being in the multiverse takes a huge amount of information, in the
<BR>
form of its &quot;address&quot;.  The actual rule seems to be that the information
<BR>
in a subsystem is limited by the sum of the initial information in the
<BR>
universe, plus the information needed to locate and specify the extent
<BR>
of the subregion.  I wonder what if any connections this might have to
<BR>
Chaitin's limitations.
