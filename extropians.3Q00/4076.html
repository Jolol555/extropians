<EM>&gt; If I understand it correctly, Frank Tipler's Omega Point will produce an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infinite amount of computation in a finite amount of time by changing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way the universe collapses in the final moments before the big crunch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could the same results be produced by making a black hole collapse in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similiar way?
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe Tipler considered this question in his book, and the answer
<BR>
was no.  As I understand it, the trick is to make the universe collapse in
<BR>
a special way, so that it becomes extremely elongated in one direction,
<BR>
like a stretched football or a long balloon.  As the collapse continues
<BR>
it has to rebound and then become even more elongated in a different
<BR>
direction.  This must go on forever, with ever more extreme degrees of
<BR>
elongation, in all the different directions.
<BR>
<P>Only with this special type of collapse is infinite computation possible.
<BR>
It has to be the whole universe collapsing for this trick to work.
<BR>
<P>Of course recent astronomical observations suggest that the universe
<BR>
won't collapse at all, challenging some aspects of Tipler's theory
<BR>
(in particular the claim that collapse is inevitable).
