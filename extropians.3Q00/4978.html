<P>(Samantha first)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If you know better I would very much like to know how to improve on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; this.  I've been wanting my library online for many years now. - samantha
</EM><BR>
(then spike)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;You and all of us.  I have over a thousand titles, most of em
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hardback.  Ideally I would like to ASCII all the text without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;destroying the books, if possible.  Let me know if you find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything workable.  {8-]  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>This has been an interest of mine now for several years.  Its value as
<BR>
consumer product is, I assert, obvious, and I would guess that Samantha,
<BR>
spike, and I are only three of millions who would make use of it on the
<BR>
instant it became available.
<BR>
<P>I therefore offer to join forces with anyone who would like to collaborate
<BR>
in its development as a commercial project. 
<BR>
<P>It could be a book holder and page turner that mounts/sets on a flatbed
<BR>
scanner (the page turner and scanner would clearly be linked to the
<BR>
computer which would coordinate the sequence of events), or a book holder
<BR>
and page turner equipped with a mounting frame to accomodate a digital
<BR>
camera (again, camera and page turner linked to the computer), or it could
<BR>
be a single dedicated unit: one power cable, one data cable to the
<BR>
computer, and a slot for placing the book (or, in the large industrial
<BR>
model, a stack of books).  I suggest that these three variants comprise the
<BR>
beginnings of a product line.
<BR>
<P>The IP issues as I see them: it would be a product that fills a strongly
<BR>
sought after, completely legitimate demand, but which enables an
<BR>
&quot;illegitimate&quot; application.  I'm completely convinced that, after
<BR>
precedents set by the vcr, cassete recorders, xerox copiers, and the
<BR>
already established fact of scanners and ocr, no legal challenge could be
<BR>
successful, in fact I rather doubt such a challenge would even be mounted.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I gotta believe this in the works already, if not imminent.
<BR>
Probably by the scanner people.
<BR>
<P>Somebody out there knows.  Who can burst my bubble?  Or, since I like the
<BR>
idea so much and am waiting with cash in hand, cmon someone...
<BR>
<P>SHOW ME THE MAGIC!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
