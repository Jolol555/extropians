</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because billions are conspicuous. People would notice, the media would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; report it; I'd be able to find out who it was. And I'd want to contact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person, because there's a fair chance they'd throw me a few scraps for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having been such a damned nice guy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, the rules stipulate that the person can never find out about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me. So, I can only assume that whoever is running the competition is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do something rather frightful to me, to enforce that rule, because they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know I'm going to try to violate it (I've posted it in a public forum after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all). These people have the ability to grant billions of dollars to random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans. That's scary.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I'd say no, then go hide under the bed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>So you don't trust yourself to have the integrity to obey a contract? And you
<BR>
don't trust anyone else to have the integrity to obey a contract to not
<BR>
communicate with the news media about this event? Pretty cynical.
