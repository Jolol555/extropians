If the luddites win and we have to launch cryoships to Alpha centauri,
<BR>
then we might as well take Jupiter &amp; Saturn with us.

<P>All I'm looking for is energy cost -- what would that be if we
<BR>
wanted to take Jupiter from our Sun to Alpha Centauri (start
<BR>
&amp; stop costs on both ends), in say 100 or 1000 years?
<BR>
<P>About the asteroids, I think we *should* be able to claim them but
<BR>
I'm not sure that is currently allowed under Space Law.  Tom McKendree
<BR>
would know more as I think he has studied this.

<P>Robert, by the standards of 22nd+ century peoples I may be considered a total luddite for saying this but... LEAVE THE DANG PLANETS WHERE THEY'RE AT!!!
<BR>
<P>I will still probably be in my basic biological form(with hopefully many upgrades though) at the time you envision and wearing a t-shirt which says &quot;We have to stop somewhere!&quot;  
<BR>
<P>Of course you will all laugh at me for one billionth of a second and than go on with whatever projects uploaded and super-enhanced minds do... like dismantling Jupiter and Saturn!

P.S. If the luddites really win than you will NOT be going on a colony ship anywhere outside the solar system.  They will want you SQUARELY under their thumb to make SURE you do not get out of hand.  Given enough time who knows what you could accomplish left to your own devices...
