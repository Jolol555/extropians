<P><EM>&gt; Well, there the William Gibson approach from Neuromancer, an

<EM>&gt; electromagnetic shotgun wired to it's forehead.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good one, Brian. Of course this would make AIs want to avoid the shotgun blast,
<BR>
and not really make them want to be friendly. Some people have theorized that
<BR>
people are friendly because people fear even more the consequences of being
<BR>
unfriendly.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;People fear robots because they think they will rule human beings. But the
<BR>
reason we ourselves want to rule other people is that it's much easier to
<BR>
survive when we are in a position of power. But robots can act unselfishly.
<BR>
Robots can be saints -- intelligent and unselfish. For humans, being intelligent
<BR>
is easy, but being unselfish is rather impossible.&quot;
