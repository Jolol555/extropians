It appears as if J. R. Molloy &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20Conlanging&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009050846.KAA08125@color.sics.se&gt;">jr@shasta.com</A>&gt; wrote:

|&gt; They're just elements of what is called gender-neutral
<BR>
|&gt; text: all I'm saying is that there are obvious
<BR>
|&gt; problems with the english language, such that extra
<BR>
|&gt; systems are often created to implement or modify it...
<BR>
|
<BR>
|There may be problems with the language, but nothing compared to the problems
<BR>
|created by modifying it to suit the wishes of ideologues and meddlers.
<BR>
|The English language is beautiful, and was perhaps more beautiful in
<BR>
|Shakespeare's day. With the advent of printed dictionaries, it became possible
<BR>
|to teach people the language so that dialects did not overtake it, but could
<BR>
|still enrich it. The language continues to evolve spontaneously and words are
<BR>
|added to it continuously.
<BR>
|&quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Why is it important to always point at the person's sex?
<BR>
<P>In Finnish, there exists a single pronoun for third person singular, and
<BR>
when one feels that the sex must be pointed at, one can do that, using
<BR>
&quot;the woman&quot; or the like.
<BR>
<P>I believe much of the resistance against language changes comes from simple
<BR>
conservatism, esp. among English language users.
