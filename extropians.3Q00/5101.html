<P><EM>&gt; Where did you get the absolutely dumb idea that 'anyone can give up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a baby'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...you think babies are sme generic commodity??  Like, anyone can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stripped clean of heritage, ancestry, tribe, relatedness, family,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identity...... to be made into a fake someone never born.
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly the ideal situation is for a baby to be with her own
<BR>
parents--or better yet with a group of related people, so that she has
<BR>
more than one culturally defined mother &amp; father.    And its true that
<BR>
the people I've known who were raised by adoptive parents all have had a
<BR>
strong desire to find their biological parents.  But in less than ideal
<BR>
situations, such as where the mother and father are deade or are not
<BR>
mature enough or mentally stable enough to raise a child, adoptive
<BR>
parents seem to be a better choice than foster homes, institutions,  or
<BR>
death (although in some cases, as I argued yesterday, death might be the
<BR>
most rational choice).
<BR>
<P>I once found a tiny abandonned kitten by the side of a city street.  At
<BR>
the time, I had a dog, Ursa Minor, who had always wanted to have puppies
<BR>
(at least I guessed as much based on her maternal actions) but was a
<BR>
sterile (she was 1/2 German Shepherd and 1/2 coyote--apparently sometimes
<BR>
the cross doesn't result in fertile offspring).  I took the kitten home
<BR>
and gave him to Ursa, who licked him and cuddled him as though he were
<BR>
her own baby.  The kitten began nursing, and within a couple of days,
<BR>
Ursa was producing milk.  She raised the kitten, nursing him much longer
<BR>
than mother cats usually allow.  The cat Marion seemed to be a normal and
<BR>
happy cat and stayed with me for years, until my own child was born, at
<BR>
which time he left in a huff and moved in with the next-door neighbor.  
<BR>
(I'm not sure how relevant this is to adoption of human babies, but it
<BR>
does show that animals can be pretty flexible about whom they accept as a
<BR>
parent)
