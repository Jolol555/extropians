</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What am I looking for? ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You claim some kind of communication with an animal. Whether you call it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spiritual or something else, you have offered that this connection was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real and that something meaningful was transferred between the two of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you. My questions: What kind of &quot;communication&quot; do you think took place?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you think this possible with other animal forms? Do you think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific situation gave rise to this communicatory feeling, or do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think this is something more general?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll start with the 2nd question about communication between humans and
<BR>
animals other than coyotes, because my background might shed light on my
<BR>
experience with the coyote.  As a child I lived in a large city, but my
<BR>
family had a country place where we spent weekends. I'd spend the whole of
<BR>
each weekend wandering the woods and fields on foot or horseback. I was only
<BR>
a small child when I first started hanging out in the woods, and the animals
<BR>
seemed to realize that I wasn't a threat to them.  I can remember playing a
<BR>
sort of hide-and-seek game with young white-tailed deer, whose personalities
<BR>
are something like domestic goats'--they're very curious and playful when
<BR>
they're young.
<BR>
<P>When I was around 11 years old, I found a baby pigeon who'd fallen from her
<BR>
nest.  She was a tiny, naked thing that I had to feed gruel from a medicine
<BR>
dropper, but she survived to adulthood, brought home a mate (I never kept
<BR>
her penned)and raised babies of her own.  She somehow knew which window of
<BR>
the house was mine and would perch on the window ledge and peck at the
<BR>
window until I'd go out and feed her some grain.  One day she came to my
<BR>
window, but when I went outside she didn't fly to the feeding area.  I
<BR>
discovered that someone had shot her in the breast with a pellet air rifle,
<BR>
and she'd come home to die.
<BR>
<P>When I was 14, my special horse, Mohammed Abu Tabik, was born out of one of
<BR>
my mares. I always called him Andy. When he was two years old my father
<BR>
hired a man to help me greenbreak him, which is to say, train the horse to
<BR>
the extent of putting a saddle on his back and getting into the saddle. From
<BR>
that point on, I trained him on my own.  I never put a bit into his mouth
<BR>
(although when I took him to a place that might be noisy and frightening
<BR>
such as a motorcycle race--I kept him in the city while I was in
<BR>
highschool--I would sometimes use a hackamore).  He threw me a few times
<BR>
when we were first getting to know each other well, but never out of
<BR>
meanness--he'd always turn around and look at me curiously as though he was
<BR>
wondering what I was doing sitting on the ground. After a while, I had only
<BR>
to lean slightly to let him know which way I wanted to go. No one else could
<BR>
ever ride him--he was fearsome and wild with everyone but me.
<BR>
<P>I could go on at great length, but maybe these examples are enough to show
<BR>
that I have communicated with non-humans from the time I was a young child
<BR>
and that I'm familiar with the different ways in which different animals
<BR>
communicate.  As you might expect from the rest of what I've said, I was
<BR>
also well acquainted with dogs.  One in particular, a black lab by the name
<BR>
of Henry, was one of my closest childhood friends.  Of course, this may say
<BR>
as much about the lonely nature of my childhood as about my rapport with
<BR>
non-humans.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the coyote is a close relative of the dog--in fact the 2 species can
<BR>
interbreed &amp; many of the coyote-like animals in the wild seem to be part
<BR>
dog, judging by their dogesque singing voices. The animal I cut from the
<BR>
fence appeared to be pure coyote.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I have seen the dog Henry react the same way the coyote did.  Once he had a
<BR>
small wound which became infested with larvae of the screw worm fly, which
<BR>
is apparently now extinct, thanks to the release of thousands of sterile
<BR>
males. The screw worm fly would lay eggs in a wound, and when the eggs
<BR>
hatched the larvae would eat the flesh of the unfortunate host.  Many cattle
<BR>
were lost to screw worms.  The larvae had eaten a hole about half an inch
<BR>
deep in Henry's side, and we had to dig them out with a Q-tip disinfected
<BR>
with Lysol.  It was obvious that the digging was painful, but Henry lay very
<BR>
still and let us work on him.  The coyote was the same way.  I don't for a
<BR>
second believe that she understood my words.  Rather, it was the tone of my
<BR>
voice, and possibly some other (unidentified) signal that went from me to
<BR>
her.  Could be smell.  I've heard old-timers say that animals can smell
<BR>
fear.  I know I've smelled fear on humans--their sweat has a peculiar odor
<BR>
when they're afraid.  Maybe animals can smell friendship as well.
<BR>
<P>OK, I think that takes care of all three questions.  No formal studies, only
<BR>
a lifetime of experience.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another question for both of us: Is this connection possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with other life forms? Plants and trees are a good example here. Many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe that their plants understand and respond to their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communications. Do you believe this is true?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>No, no, no!  Ain't gonna get me to go down THAT road, not today anyhow.
<BR>
Well, OK, yes I communicate with my damned plants. So be it.  What can I
<BR>
say?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why, or why not?
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, here's a simple example.  A French mulberry plant tells me it's
<BR>
suffering from heat and water stress by drooping its leaves very
<BR>
pathetically.  Yes, I know it's actually drooping the leaves to prevent loss
<BR>
of water vapor through the stomata.  But it communicates its condition to me
<BR>
nevertheless. I'm not going to try to justify talking to plants.  You have
<BR>
to BE there, I think.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But hopefully, this latest post is worth starting a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new discussion on forms of communication with psychologies very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different from ours. Is it even possible/meaningful?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, communicating with non-humans is awfully USEful. What good would a dog
<BR>
be if you couldn't communicate with it? Not good for much of anything but
<BR>
eating, huh?  And I don't even like to eat dogs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What do you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the factors involved? How would you go about replicating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feelings of connection with the coyote?
</EM><BR>
<P>I reckon I'd just go on out in the woods and start communicating with
<BR>
someone or other.  I'll tell you, though, coyotes are usually pretty
<BR>
standoffish.  It's not like they'll just come around any old time and chew
<BR>
the fat with you. Now the javelinas, they're much more sociable.  Only
<BR>
trouble is, if you commit a faux pas they're likely to rip you to shreds
<BR>
with their razor-sharp canines.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Seriously though, when I talk/write with someone, I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; don't view it as adversarial.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's good to know. For some reason, your messages came across as though
<BR>
you were, well, poking fun of me for being just a simple country gal;
<BR>
especially when you use all those fancy Latin words like &quot;canine&quot; instead of
<BR>
just saying &quot;dog&quot;.  But sometimes us simple country folks know a thing or 2
<BR>
about animals.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;If you'd rather
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have an &quot;argument&quot; I'll oblige, but I'd rather not if it's all the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to you.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I'd rather not have an argument either.  Now that's something that's
<BR>
likely to interfere with communication, isn't it?
<BR>
