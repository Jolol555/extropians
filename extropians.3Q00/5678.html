<EM>&gt; &gt; The mindset that enables one to separate themselves from the herd offers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more than just the ability to defend against an inter-species attack: when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the lemmings march over the cliff, it's the socially disconnected who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; survive.  That both strategies persist in nature (and in man) suggests that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; each have offered their share of success in the past, but the changes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; our environment that we foresee in the near future could easily tip the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; balance heavily one way or the other.  Whether the balance will tip, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which way: I haven't a clue--but for many of us the wager has long since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been laid (in my case, I suspect it was at my conception...).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's an interesting point.  I would point to the increasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inter-dependence of members of society as our world becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more complex, on the other side.  Robin Hanson's article,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html</A>, discusses the seeming paradox
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that Extropians dream of a more individualistic society while we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historically moved in the opposite direction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The division of labor, trade, and specialization has been the foundation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of technological progress.  If each person had to do everything for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; himself, we'd still be in the stone age.  My bet is that the man who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work smoothly with his fellows is the one who has the survival advantage.
</EM><BR>
<P>In many ways, I would say that today we are more free in many ways than we were
<BR>
50-80 years ago, although in a few key respects we are less free. Civil Rights
<BR>
and womens lib has certainly improved the lot of their constituents, no doubt
<BR>
about it, while the internet has created a supernova increase in the amount of
<BR>
free expression occuring. However the maximum liberty that any individual may
<BR>
potentially have is less today than before. Many states do not allow the
<BR>
individual the ability or right to defend themselves, or their families or
<BR>
property adequately, while confiscatory tax and drug policies are also quite
<BR>
onerous.
<BR>
<P>Economic interdependence in terms of skills does not necessarily demand
<BR>
political inter-dependence or financial interdependence, however. The only areas
<BR>
where liberty is really decreasing are a result not of increasing
<BR>
specialization, but of increasing heritability in stratification.
