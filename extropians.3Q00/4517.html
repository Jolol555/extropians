<EM>&gt; a Popperian falsificationist. To me, facts are predictive theories 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about outcomes of experiments which have been tested and have so far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; failed to be disproved. As far as I am concerned almost nothing matches
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your criteria for a fact, since nothing non-trivial can be proven true,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and it is thus not a useful definition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well spoken.  From what does Popperian falsificationism derive?

<EM>&gt;

<P>Karl Popper was a philosopher of science who died in 1994. I first 
<BR>
encountered his work in 1990 when I read one of his books that I borrowed 
<BR>
from a friend at work. The book (whose title I can no longer recall) had 
<BR>
been published in the 1950's, and except for an appendix about the evils 
<BR>
of communist thinking, was highly enjoyable. His philosophy almost exactly 
<BR>
matched my own, but he had taken the trouble to refine it further, and had 
<BR>
worked out many implications that I had not. I found that everywhere where 
<BR>
our philosophies disagreed, he was able to convince me that his approach 
<BR>
was correct. By the time I finished the book, I was a dedicated Popperian. 
<BR>
You can find out more about him and his work at:
