<P><EM>&gt; In the music industry like any other kind of business 90% of everything is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flop. Probably even more so in the music industry. 85% of all music you see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the stores never makes back the production costs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then why are these idiots at the RIAA using the current brunt of IP laws to
<BR>
protect this antiquated way of doing business?  You would think they would get a
<BR>
clue, and use the internet to streamline their business and minimize such
<BR>
financial losses.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh and there is adult people in the music business making money .. uhhh bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad.
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Lets not forget those multi-million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;dollar hyping budgets in order to get N'Sync and Brittany Spears albums to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;market.  Give me a friggin break!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is marketing Unethical? You are not allowed to tell that you have something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to sell .. it is evil ???
</EM><BR>
<P>Again huh?  I see nothing wrong with advertising.  But when that's all I see,
<BR>
because their using IP law to maintain their monopoly on music distribution then
<BR>
I see a big problem.  Where is the competition?  When are we going to see music
<BR>
that is determined more by market forces than market budgets?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Not if we let it destroy the economical system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Destroy no, change yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If it is possible and legal to just copy something for free we will never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know it's actual worth. How much would people be willing to pay for it. And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also how much is it worth for society. Forget about the free market. There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be no market... only free.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its time we all faced the facts, as technology gets better, things get cheaper.
<BR>
Deflation is ultimately the sign of an advancing economy.  Just look at the
<BR>
amount of computation a dollar buys now a days.  Amazing!  Follow the fill
<BR>
circle of this argument.  If people are making less money from the acts of
<BR>
creation, and those things are costing less then where is the harm done?  At
<BR>
some point such an economy is inevitable, and there probably will be severe
<BR>
dislocations and destabilization's along the way.  What we are experiencing now
<BR>
is the equivalent of two revolutions exceeding all the changes that were brought
<BR>
with the agricultural and industrial.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh but you are not able to listen to it on a walkman. You have to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; videotape to play it back which is a hassle. And there are several other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons why you would want you music on a CD. Those reasons sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dissapear on MP3. It is a better medium in many regards than any other there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has been for music. Excluding sound quality. In short in the other mediums
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are barriers to entry that most people don't record their music that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way. At least not in a big way.
</EM><BR>
<P>So its legal to copy as long as its a hassle, and illegal as long as its
<BR>
convenient.  I can see it now, inconvenience becomes compulsory!  Wait a second,
<BR>
I'm experiencing Deja Vu!!! (please see my last post)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; No one has proven that Napster is going to result in better music or ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No one has proven that its going to make music worse either. Nothing can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;worse than the over-marketed hype they call music now-a-days.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is your taste you are stating. Not really a valid argument.
</EM><BR>
<P>The first part is a valid argument, the second is my opinion - have a problem
<BR>
with that?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh artist cannot make money???
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not stopping them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh yeas ... let's destroy the economic system right now, so that we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prepare for something that might happen sometime in the future. Remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nano is not here yet. It might never be or maybe only partial.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not advocating that we destroy the economic system.  These technologies are
<BR>
going to advance whether you or I like it or not.  What I am advocating is that
<BR>
we better get real about obsolete laws that neither function or are enforceable
<BR>
in an age of cheap duplication costs.  Think of the internet as a rehearsal.
<BR>
When nanotech arrives, we better have worked these issue out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is a big world with many people making a living in different stages of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technological savy. We have to change the system slowly enough as not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroy it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you in principle.  However time is running out.  Nanotechnology is
<BR>
coming, and probably sooner than later.  I would rather we experience some
<BR>
severe economic instabilities if it means that we have a chance of navigation
<BR>
the nanotech waters without an apocalypse. Please see the extensive arguments
<BR>
that I and many others made on <A HREF="http://nanodot.org/">http://nanodot.org/</A>  about open-sourcing nanotech
<BR>
research and development.
