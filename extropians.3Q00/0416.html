<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20Owning%20as%20cultural%20baggage%20%20(was:%20Is%20Eugenics%20Really%20A%20Bad%20Thing?)&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGGEJCFJAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On an issue like &quot;owning&quot;, I think it's many-layered, and one might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to try to separate the:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * hardwired aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * personal preference aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * cultural aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * government aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     (if the two have a legal arrangement i.e. legal marriage)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and then see where the &quot;owning&quot; come from. I suspect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cultural aspect is very big.
</EM><BR>
<P>The &quot;owning&quot; is not all on the part of the men, of course.  Many women want
<BR>
to &quot;own&quot; their spouses or SO's as well.  The lesbian couples I know have
<BR>
this same problem with owning each other.  I've said that I prefer having
<BR>
women as housemates, but this may well be because the women I've lived with
<BR>
have been friends rather than lovers.  Where I've had male housemates who
<BR>
were not lovers, they were as pleasant to live with as women, except that
<BR>
they didn't tend as much to do things like pick bouquets of flowers for the
<BR>
house and make scones and trifle.
<BR>
<P>What I found difficult to bear about marriage, and why I bailed even though
<BR>
my husband was a wonderful person, was the way in which it made life...how
<BR>
can I say this?...predictable? stable? These are things that many people
<BR>
WANT in their lives, but I hated the feeling that I couldn't decide on the
<BR>
spur of the moment to take off for a weekend in Mexico, and especially I
<BR>
hated never being alone.  I seem to have a requirement for a certain minimum
<BR>
amount of solitude, but when I tried to go off by myself my husband would
<BR>
think I was angry with him--which I soon would be when he kept pressing me
<BR>
to be with him.
<BR>
<P>A lot of this is personal to me, and though it may have something to do with
<BR>
the cultural position of women relative to men, it may have more to do with
<BR>
my own greater than usual need for solitude and self-direction.  When I left
<BR>
my husband, I resolved never to inflict myself on another man ever again,
<BR>
and I've pretty much held to that resolution. Sometimes, though, I wish it
<BR>
didn't have to be so.
<BR>
<P><EM>   &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's hard to get past heavy cultural conditioning. Many younger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; girls (for example: teenage) are conditioned that one of their life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goals &quot;should&quot; be to get married and raise a family.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;This
<BR>
<EM>&gt; conditioning could be (and often is) at odds with the goal of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building a career. The conditioning can go deep for the girl too, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this way: &quot;I am not a whole person unless I have a husband.&quot; Or &quot;His
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; career is more important than my career.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Along these lines, I remember my mother saying to me when I was 12 or 13,
<BR>
&quot;You're probably going to have a hard time finding a husband.  It'll be hard
<BR>
for you to find a man who's smarter than you.&quot;  At the time I thought, &quot;Why
<BR>
the heck would I want to find a man who's smarter than me?&quot; but later, of
<BR>
course, I realized it was because the man was supposed to be the boss, and
<BR>
who wants to be bossed around by someone who's not as smart.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that one can &quot;de-condition&quot; oneself in the cultural aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the gender-roles in living together relationships, but because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the roles played are often played unconsciously, &quot;de-conditioning&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oneself is hard work. One has to be ultra-aware to catch oneself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; playing those roles. I know that I fell into a lot of traps where I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was playing roles that were based on some cultural biases, and many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of those roles were not beneficial to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Did you find yourself falling into the roles on your own, setting yourself
<BR>
up, so to speak, or did your husband steer you into the roles? My husband
<BR>
was never angry or violent, but he would try to make me feel guilty for not
<BR>
spending enough time with him (and he often succeeded; in fact I feel guilty
<BR>
at this very moment, for hurting him by leaving--and it's been 11 years)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some communities that I'm curious about for living together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationships are the gay and lesbian communities. Do specific roles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exist for each person in those partnerships? What are they, and how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are they defined?
</EM><BR>
<P>I considered trying a lesbian lifestyle, and got to be friends with some
<BR>
lesbians.  But I found that their relationships tended to be every bit as
<BR>
flawed along the same lines as their heterosexual counterparts.  I also
<BR>
found that I wasn't interested in being lovers with women; whether that's
<BR>
something I was born with or whether it's purely from the cultural taboo, I
<BR>
haven't figured out. From watching other animals, I would think that we all
<BR>
have bisexual tendencies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree with you, but we should probably state the time periods. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matriarchal cultures existed some many thousands of years ago, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read that it really flourished between 3000 and 1200 B.C. in Sumer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Egypt, and the Mediterranean basin. The patriarchal cultures, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; began to dominate couple of thousand years ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've read different theories about this.  Even cultures which had
<BR>
matrilineal descent reckoning often have male domination of females.
<BR>
There's a very wonderful book called _In the Wake of the Goddesses_ that
<BR>
examines how the Jewish attitude towards women changed over time and
<BR>
discusses the other cultures which existed when the Jewish culture was
<BR>
young.  Very thoroughly research and well documented.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And some of the mythical transformations were a little bit bizarre.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Athena, the Old European Bird Goddess, was eventually transformed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into a militarized figure carrying a shield and wearing a helmet,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and in the later myths she was born from the head of Zeus. Other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goddesses who, before, could create on their own without help from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the male deities, gradually changed into brides, wives, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; daughters who could only create after intercourse with a god.
</EM><BR>
<P>I always fancied Artemis, goddess of hunt and moon.  And Inana. &quot;Inana,
<BR>
great light, lioness.&quot;
<BR>
I HAVE found the old myths empowering.  It definitely makes a difference in
<BR>
my outlook on life to realize that being a strong woman is not something
<BR>
abnormal or &quot;deformed.&quot; Once someone asked my daughter if she wasn't afraid
<BR>
staying out in the woods with just her mother and no man to protect us.  My
<BR>
daughter answered, &quot;No, I have complete confidence in my mother.&quot;  She had a
<BR>
nightmare once in which there was a monster that was killing people.
<BR>
Everyone was afraid of the monster, but I went out and killed it and brought
<BR>
the carcass in to cook and eat.  I love that dream. It has mythical
<BR>
qualities.
