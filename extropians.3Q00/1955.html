<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I am certainly not one of those moral/cultural relativists who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; thinks all traditions are equal...
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; What cultural relativism espouses is not the &quot;equality&quot; of all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traditions.  It's proponents seek to point out (I don't want you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to agree, but represent it accurately--ie as what it really is)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that western culture sees itself as the pinacle of civilization,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asking all others to join us, come &quot;up to our level&quot;.  And that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is not how all cultures view us. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly can't disagree that eurocentrism is silly, and that's
<BR>
pretty much the point I was in fact making--that there is a lot to
<BR>
be learned from other cultures (you did actuall read the rest of
<BR>
what I said, right?).  In particular, I rather like certain parts
<BR>
of Jewish tradition such as the respect for industry and education,
<BR>
and certain parts of Southern culture such as strong individualism
<BR>
combined with social interaction.  My initial caveat was there so
<BR>
that I wouldn't be associated with those who actually /do/ believe
<BR>
in total cultural and moral relativism; such people are indeed
<BR>
common, and are very up front about their actual beliefs.  The
<BR>
very words &quot;...what's right and wrong in his/her culture...&quot; pop
<BR>
up frequently in texts and speeches.
<BR>
<P>I am glad that you see the more mainstream multiculturalism as
<BR>
rejecting that point of view, but the point of view /does/ exist
<BR>
exactly as I have described it, and is /very/ common.  There
<BR>
really are respected American academics today who will look you
<BR>
in the eye and say with a straight face that, for example, the
<BR>
subjugation of women in Muslim countries is acceptable for that
<BR>
culture, or that child labor is acceptable in China and India.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While we seek to bring a thrid world culture up to the standards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of our &quot;superior&quot; one, many ignore the wishes of the people being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; converted.  This is reminiscent of missionaries, who believed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone non-christian was a barbarian, and needed &quot;saving&quot;.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroyed the cultures and traditions of anyone who was not like them. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, Christian missionaries did a lot of harm, and there are many
<BR>
aspects of old cultures that were regrettably lost.  But there are
<BR>
also aspects of old cultures that /deserved/ to be obliterated, like
<BR>
slavery, ritual violence, castes.  There are also, of course, those
<BR>
unsavory aspects in Western/Christian culture that we tried to impose
<BR>
on them: sexism, racism, militarism.  It would have been much better
<BR>
for both us and them if we had interacted and learned from each other
<BR>
the best aspects of each culture--where &quot;best&quot; is judged by as close
<BR>
to objective standards as reason allows for such things.
