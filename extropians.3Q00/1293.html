<EM>&gt; From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20SV:%20Makign%20money%20as%20a%20creative%20(was)%20Napster:%20thoughts%20and&In-Reply-To=&lt;3971EB2F.718E7F1C@turbont.net&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thats not what he's saying. The viewers pay nothing to receive the tv
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transmissions, and are also free to record any tv shows on their vcr,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; license. Its advertisers who pay the cost of production and transmission,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as can be done on CDs, with ads between each song (as has already been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; before, see Seig Seig Sputnik, dating back to 1987).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Read again.  He says:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) &quot;The naked, unsupported assertion that music sales will not support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artists absent copyright won't become true no matter how many times you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; repeat it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To summarize, he believes: The statement &quot;music sales will not support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artists absent copyright&quot; is false.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mr. Crocker goes on to say:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) &quot;If this [the above statement] were *true* [emphasis mine] broadcast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; television and radio would not exist at all, and yet they are billion dollar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To summarize, he believes: If the statement &quot;music sales will not support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artists absent copyright&quot; were true, then TV and radio would not exist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thus, we are to gather that he believes that TV and radio are capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supporting their makers without the need for copyright.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which is pure garbage-- it doesn't matter that they make their money from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advertisers-- advertisers only pay people with audiences.  If you don't own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your content, then I can broadcast it too and I can get all the advertising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revenue.  Again, there would be no good reason to spend money 'making'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; content-- I should just concentrate on being the best broadcaster possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>The premium value of advertising during the broadcasting the superbowl
<BR>
live is around $2 million a minute, while normal ad rates run about
<BR>
$50,000.00 per minute. Therefore, the value of advertising solely due to
<BR>
the event being an original broadcast, with that audience size, is $1.95
<BR>
milllion per minute. Any later rebroadcast of the superbowl would not be
<BR>
able to command such a premium above the standard broadcast rates, so
<BR>
your protest is itself *garbage*.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In addition, a viewer's 'right' to record the transmissions is a lot more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited and dicey than you might believe.  Believe it or not, broadcasters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do guard the right of recording and re-transmittal.
</EM><BR>
<P>But they do not guard against private recording and replaying, nor do
<BR>
they charge their audience for the original transmission. Broadcasters
<BR>
actually do NOT own the actual shows for later broadcast, they only have
<BR>
original broadcast rights. The producers retain syndication rights
<BR>
(reruns) under their production agreements with the original
<BR>
broadcasters, and when the show has run for several years, the producers
<BR>
then put rerun rights up for bid, which may or may not be won by the
<BR>
original broadcaster.
<BR>
<P>The original broadcaster commands a premium value on advertising time
<BR>
during original broadcasts over and above that charged for ad time
<BR>
during rerun broadcasts, so there is obviously a real value to the mere
<BR>
fact of being the original broadcaster.
<BR>
<P>In the event that copyright on tv broadcasts were eliminated, they would
<BR>
easily overcome any potential losses by adding clauses to agreements
<BR>
with cable companies and their subscribers about re-use, so there really
<BR>
is no need for copyright on tv broadcasts.
