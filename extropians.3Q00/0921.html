&nbsp;I suppose, but isnt 
<BR>
it sufficient to show that there is a muuuuch easier way?  spike 
<BR>
<P>Sometimes, perhaps.  However Randi doesnt always just point out a simpler
<BR>
hypothesis, he has been known to deliberately falsify results and interfere
<BR>
(sabotage) experiments and experimenters credentials.
<BR>
I'm afraid I cant remember the exact details but a couple of years back
<BR>
there was a big row about homeopathic medicine, with claims that it had been
<BR>
scientifically tested and shown to have positive results (an article in one
<BR>
of the big magazines - Nature, or New Scientist).  Randi and friends went
<BR>
into this lab to test that proper scientific procedures had been carried out
<BR>
and made several allegations about the way the experiments were conducted.
<BR>
As I recall he actually accused the experimenters of falsifying data - all
<BR>
allegations were later shown to be completely unfounded.
