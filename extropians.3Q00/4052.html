<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For instance, I'd love to be able to rent a robot body for the day 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;a US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; robot-rental dealer (robo-hurtz), and be able to turn up to my US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;clients
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and actually interact with them, whilst tucked in my little 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hidey-hole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Melbourne. I'd pay money for that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why waste all that money?  You could hire a real, live human being to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around an RF linked webcam - or two, for binocular vision - and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;microphones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   With a fairly simple switching system, you could give them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instructions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or even incorporate a joystick, mouse, or touchpad controller that would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; various input modalities - buzzers, tones, or actual vocal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interpretations -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to instruct them how to move, what to look towards, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Your voice would either be a speaker mounted as close to the person's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mouth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as possible - probably low neck area, or their voice as an interpreter, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you hearing and/or reading auto-translation via voice recognition and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; translation software.  A further check on accuracy could be provided via 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heads-up display for your telepersona operator, who would see the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; voice signal looping back as a retranslation into their own language.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Oh, let's see...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;* Interaction (If you get frustrated and curse a robot, it won't walk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   out in the middle of a job.  Plus, the tele-operation style proposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   here is also known as 'micro-managing', which has been shown to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   negative results as opposed to letting someone do a job they know how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to do, though this does not apply for a robot that does not know how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to do anything.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I could probably think of more if I tried.
</EM><BR>
On the plus side, the human can recognize nuances and details and make 
<BR>
inferences that can add significantly to the experience.  The security 
<BR>
concerns that you mention would certainly have to be taken into account.  I 
<BR>
was thinking more about someone who would like to attend three different 
<BR>
conferences in 3 different cities at the same time, or who simply couldn't 
<BR>
make time to travel, but would still like to snoop around and check out the 
<BR>
competition first hand.  The whole experience would be recorded, no doubt, 
<BR>
and several different teleoperators could tap in or take over direction.  In 
<BR>
addition, the humbot could be given general instructions and a heads-up 
<BR>
display list of priorities to check out - boothes to visit, products to get 
<BR>
a close look at, people to watch for, so that the teleoperators could take a 
<BR>
break or switch to other humbots at other locations.
<BR>
<P>On the security side, a company of the size of say Sony, which is already 
<BR>
doing a lot of R &amp; D in this general area, could train its own people and 
<BR>
use them to get expert coverage of a subject.
<BR>
<P>I think that it would be fun to organize a party teleop during the Brazilian 
<BR>
samba contests.  A group - or a website! - oops now I've gone and killed a 
<BR>
potential patent...  Darn, gosh,    o'well,   could set up a teleop with 
<BR>
good bandwidth and do a pay-for-view, pay-more-for-control remote party.  
<BR>
The applications for X-sites are obvious, although they get pretty good 
<BR>
dedicated site coverage already, I'm sure.
