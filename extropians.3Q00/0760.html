The amino acid carnosine is a natural AGE inhibitor found in high 
<BR>
concentrations in the brain, muscle tissue and the lens of the human eye. It 
<BR>
is also known to be an antioxidant capable of protecting cell membranes and 
<BR>
other cell structures. In vitro studies demonstrated that carnosine inhibits 
<BR>
glycosylation and crosslinking of proteins induced by reactive aldehydes, 
<BR>
and that it is effective in reducing AGE formation by competing with 
<BR>
proteins for binding with the sugars. The authors suggest that this nontoxic 
<BR>
compound should be explored in the treatment of such conditions as diabetic 
<BR>
complications, inflammatory disorders, alcoholic liver disease and possibly 
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease (Hipkiss AR et al., 1998).
<BR>
<P>Many additional functions for carnosine have been suggested, such as 
<BR>
immunomodulator, neurotransmitter, metal ion chelator and wound healing 
<BR>
agent. In a series of animal studies it was demonstrated that carnosine was 
<BR>
effective in overcoming muscle fatigue, lowering blood pressure, reducing 
<BR>
stress and hyperactivity and inducing sleep (Quinn PR et al., 1992). More 
<BR>
recently carnosine was shown to delay senescence in cultured human 
<BR>
fibroblasts (McFarland GA et al., 1994).
<BR>
<P>In an animal study on the effect of carnosine in the ischemic brain, 
<BR>
carnosine had a protective effect, preserving nerve cells from damage and 
<BR>
death, suggesting that this amino acid might be a promising treatment for 
<BR>
patients with stroke (Stvolinsky, SL et al., 1998). In other studies 
<BR>
carnosine was shown to be effective in the treatment of senile cataracts in 
<BR>
dogs, suggesting the possible use of carnosine in the prevention and 
<BR>
treatment of cataracts in humans (Halliwell B et al., 1985).
<BR>
<P>Along with carnosine, lipoic acid has been shown to control the formation of 
<BR>
AGE and reduce protein damage from glycation in both humans and animals. 
<BR>
This has proven to be of special value in preventing and treating diabetic 
<BR>
neuropathy, which is believed to be due in part to glycation and protein 
<BR>
oxidation by glucose (glycoxidation). Lipoic acid has been an approved 
<BR>
treatment for this condition in Germany for 25 years.

<BR>
<P>The fragmentation of human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) was observed 
<BR>
during incubation with H(2)O(2). Hydroxyl
<BR>
radical scavengers such as sodium azide, formate and mannitol protected the 
<BR>
fragmentation of Cu,Zn-SOD. These results
<BR>
suggested that *OH was implicated in the hydrogen peroxide-mediated 
<BR>
Cu,Zn-SOD fragmentation. Carnosine, homocarnosine
<BR>
and anserine have been proposed to act as anti-oxidants in vivo. We 
<BR>
investigated whether three compounds could protect the
<BR>
fragmentation of Cu,Zn-SOD induced by H(2)O(2). The results showed that 
<BR>
carnosine, homocarnosine and anserine
<BR>
significantly protected the fragmentation of Cu,Zn-SOD. All three compounds 
<BR>
also protected the loss of enzyme activity
<BR>
induced by H(2)O(2). Carnosine, homocarnosine and anserine effectively 
<BR>
inhibited the formation of *OH by the
<BR>
Cu,Zn-SOD/H(2)O(2) system. These results suggest that carnosine and related 
<BR>
compounds can protect the hydrogen
<BR>
peroxide-mediated Cu,Zn-SOD fragmentation through the scavenging of *OH.

<P>Further evidence for the rejuvenating effects of the dipeptide L-carnosine
<BR>
on cultured human diploid fibroblasts.
<BR>
<P>McFarland GA, Holliday R
<BR>
<P>CSIRO Division of Molecular Science, Sydney Laboratory, North Ryde, 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>We have confirmed and extended previous results on the beneficial effects of 
<BR>
L-carnosine on growth, morphology, and
<BR>
longevity of cultured human fibroblasts, strains MRC-5 and HFF-1. We have 
<BR>
shown that late-passage HFF-1 cells retain a
<BR>
juvenile appearance in medium containing 50 mM carnosine, and revert to a 
<BR>
senescent phenotype when carnosine is removed.
<BR>
Switching cells between medium with and without carnosine also switches 
<BR>
their phenotype from senescent to juvenile, and the
<BR>
reverse. The exact calculation of fibroblast lifespans in population 
<BR>
doublings (PDs) depends on the proportion of inoculated
<BR>
cells that attach to their substrate and the final yield of cells in each 
<BR>
subculture. We have shown that carnosine does not affect
<BR>
cell attachment, but does increase longevity in PDs. However, the plating 
<BR>
efficiency of MRC-5 cells seeded at low density is
<BR>
strongly increased in young and senescent cells by carnosine, as shown by 
<BR>
the growth of individual colonies. We have also
<BR>
demonstrated that very late-passage MRC-5 cells (with weekly change of 
<BR>
medium without subculture) remain attached to their
<BR>
substrate much longer in medium containing carnosine in comparison to 
<BR>
control cultures, and also retain a much more normal
<BR>
phenotype. Carnosine is a naturally occurring dipeptide present at high 
<BR>
concentration in a range of human tissues. We suggest it
<BR>
has an important role in cellular homeostasis and maintenance.

<P><P>1. The biological effects of carnosine, a natural hydrophilic neuropeptide, 
<BR>
on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathological
<BR>
generation are reviewed. 2. We describe direct antioxidant action observed 
<BR>
in the in vitro experiments. 3. Carnosine was found
<BR>
to effect metabolism indirectly. These effects are reflected in ROS turnover 
<BR>
regulation and lipid peroxidation (LPO) processes.
<BR>
4. During brain ischemia carnosine acts as a neuroprotector, contributing to 
<BR>
better cerebral blood flow restoration,
<BR>
electroencephalography (EEG) normalization, decreased lactate accumulation, 
<BR>
and enzymatic protection against ROS. 5. The
<BR>
data presented demonstrate that carnosine is a specific regulator of 
<BR>
essential metabolic pathways in neurons supporting brain
<BR>
homeostasis under unfavorable conditions.

<P>Carnosine, a protective, anti-ageing peptide?

<P>Hipkiss AR

<P>Molecular Biology and Biophysics Group, King's College London, Strand, UK.
<BR>
<P>Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) has protective functions additional to 
<BR>
anti-oxidant and free-radical scavenging roles. It
<BR>
extends cultured human fibroblast life-span, kills transformed cells, 
<BR>
protects cells against aldehydes and an amyloid peptide
<BR>
fragment and inhibits, in vitro, protein glycation (formation of 
<BR>
cross-links, carbonyl groups and AGEs) and DNA/protein
<BR>
cross-linking. Carnosine is an aldehyde scavenger, a likely lipofuscin (age 
<BR>
pigment) precursor and possible modulator of
<BR>
diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

<BR>
<P>The dipeptide carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) was readily glycosylated 
<BR>
non-enzymatically upon incubation with the sugars
<BR>
glucose, galactose, deoxyribose and the triose dihydroxyacetone. Carnosine 
<BR>
inhibited glycation of actyl-Lys-His-amide by
<BR>
dihydroxyacetone and it protected alpha-crystallin, superoxide dismutase and 
<BR>
catalise against glycation and cross-linking
<BR>
mediated by ribose, deoxyribose, dihydroxyacetone, dihydroxyacetone 
<BR>
phosphate and fructose. Unlike certain glycated amino
<BR>
acids, glycated carnosine was non-mutagenic. The potential biological and 
<BR>
therapeutic significance of these observations are
<BR>
discussed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Cerami of the Kenneth S. Warren Laboratories in Tarrytown,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N.Y., suspected some 30 years ago that sugar affects how the body ages,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on observations of diabetics, who age rapidly. Sugars are an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;essential source of energy, but once in circulation they can act as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;molecular glue, attaching themselves to the amino groups in tissue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proteins and cross-linking them into hard yellow-brown compounds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known as advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, after years of bread, noodles and cakes, human tissues
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inevitably become rigid and yellow with pigmented AGE deposits. For
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most part, piling on dark pigments in the teeth, bones and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skin is harmless.  But where glucose forms tight bonds with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long-lived protein collagen, the result is a constellation of changes,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including thickened arteries, stiff joints, feeble muscles and failing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organs--the hallmarks of a frail old age.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerami's team showed in the mid-1980s that aminoguanidine could keep
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tissues of diabetic rats and other old animals as elastic as those
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of young control subjects. It boosted their cardiovascular function
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and improved other age-related disorders. Further studies showed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that aminoguanidine lowered diabetics' urine albumin--an indicator
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of kidney malfunction--and delayed AGE-related damage to the retina.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single fountain-of-youth elixir is highly unlikely, says Tamara
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harris of the National Institute on Aging, because other activities,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as free-radical oxidation and possibly telomere shortening,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also contribute to the body's slow decline. Moreover, AGE-related
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research tends to be slow: Harris points out that there is no easy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well-validated way to measure AGE in the body, a shortcoming that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complicates trials. To Harris, however, AGE breakers remain an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appealing option. &quot;This is a nice approach because it is multifocal,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aimed at a basic process that occurs in multiple systems. But,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she warns, &quot;there won't be one silver bullet.&quot;
