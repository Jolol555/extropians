<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; For instance, I'd love to be able to rent a robot body for the day from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; robot-rental dealer (robo-hurtz), and be able to turn up to my US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;clients
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and actually interact with them, whilst tucked in my little hidey-hole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Melbourne. I'd pay money for that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why waste all that money?  You could hire a real, live human being to carry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around an RF linked webcam - or two, for binocular vision - and microphones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   With a fairly simple switching system, you could give them instructions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or even incorporate a joystick, mouse, or touchpad controller that would use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various input modalities - buzzers, tones, or actual vocal interpretations -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to instruct them how to move, what to look towards, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your voice would either be a speaker mounted as close to the person's mouth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as possible - probably low neck area, or their voice as an interpreter, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you hearing and/or reading auto-translation via voice recognition and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; translation software.  A further check on accuracy could be provided via a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heads-up display for your telepersona operator, who would see the original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voice signal looping back as a retranslation into their own language.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, let's see...
<BR>
<P>* Confidentiality (Can the puppet be trusted, to at least the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;degree that you can be trusted, not to breach any secret info?  If
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not, forget about the puppet being allowed to interact with anything
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;remotely sensitive - like, say, the specs for your company's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not-yet-released project that you're working on.)
<BR>
<P>* Accuracy (Say, if the server's down and you need to get it working
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;again - or anything where you need to physically access a machine,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;whether due to security, errors, or whatnot - it's much slower to say
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;click X&quot; and have it clicked than to just click it yourself.  Plus,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if the &quot;reformat company's financial database&quot; gets accidentally
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;clicked - and errors are more likely here - are you to blame, or the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;puppet?)
<BR>
<P>* Reliability (Robots don't take sick days.  When one of them goes down
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for maintenance, you can just use another.  They're interchangable,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and you don't have to pay robots to keep them as spares, at least not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;after buying the robots up front.)
<BR>
<P>* Interaction (If you get frustrated and curse a robot, it won't walk
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;out in the middle of a job.  Plus, the tele-operation style proposed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;here is also known as 'micro-managing', which has been shown to have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;negative results as opposed to letting someone do a job they know how
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to do, though this does not apply for a robot that does not know how
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to do anything.)
<BR>
<P>I could probably think of more if I tried.
