Taken from /. Apparently (and scarily) written by someone from the US.
<BR>
How extropian does it sound to be forced to be responsible for your
<BR>
fellow man? This message was posted under the latest Katz debacle re: the
<BR>
French farmer who, rather than compete with or peacefully protest McDonalds,
<BR>
decided to vandalize it.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Some scholars believe that the basic principles of socialism derived from
<BR>
the philosophy of Plato, the teachings of the Hebrew prophets, and some parts
<BR>
of the New Testament (the Sermon on the Mount, for example). Modern socialist
<BR>
ideology, however, is essentially a joint product of the 1789 French
<BR>
Revolution and the Industrial Revolution in England--the word socialist first
<BR>
occurred in an English journal in 1827. These two great historical events,
<BR>
establishing democratic government in France and the conditions for vast
<BR>
future economic expansion in England, also engendered a state of incipient
<BR>
conflict between the property owners (the bourgeoisie) and the growing class
<BR>
of industrial workers (the proletariat); socialists have since been striving
<BR>
to eliminate or at least mitigate this conflict. 
<BR>
<P>Socialism is the political expression of the principle of human
<BR>
interdependence. It embodies the idea that as members of the human-race, we
<BR>
are all essentially responsible for one another: we have an obligation of
<BR>
mutual support and share a reciprocal bond which binds us together for our
<BR>
collective protection and maintenance. On a theory level it is a beautiful
<BR>
thing: Altruism and love for the fellow man. In practice it is the difficult
<BR>
to digest political economy. I only state this as an American. Socialism has
<BR>
a greater appeal to the masses in the third world. That does not mean it
<BR>
cannot be applied here. Expressed in a religious sense, it embodies the
<BR>
proposition that in order to fulfill one's obligation to the Creator (Divine
<BR>
Source, God or Nature) one must necessarily fulfill the commandment to serve
<BR>
one's fellow creatures. It also embodies the principle that the physical
<BR>
possessions which are bestowed, albeit temporarily, upon mankind are for the
<BR>
benefit of everyone, not being confined to the exclusive use of a privileged
<BR>
section of society. Thus we are to work together as stewards of this great
<BR>
gift we call Earth. It was R. Buckminster Fuller that once stated: 'land
<BR>
ownership is a relic of the feudal monarchy'. Bucky was right on target with
<BR>
social theory, and had been inspired to create in that arena. 
<BR>
<P>Socialism has been discredited as a workable political philosophy, and is
<BR>
considered by some to be no longer fashionable. This is the prevalent view
<BR>
of most political commentators and is certainly the opinion of those affluent
<BR>
individuals who occupy the driving seats of the various governments which are
<BR>
running the world at the present time. Unfortunately for the capitalist,
<BR>
socialism has a tendency to stick around. The reason for this is the fact
<BR>
that socialism is the expression of a basic principle of humanity: the
<BR>
fundamental and undeniable equality of the mass of mankind. In spite of the
<BR>
disapproval, there are, and always will be, a minority of thinking people who
<BR>
comprehend the essential validity of the idea: &quot;....all men are created equal.&quot;
<BR>
This quotation, no doubt, rings a bell somewhere within the faint and
<BR>
subconscious recollection of those who dwell in the, &quot;Land of the Free!&quot;. If
<BR>
men are, fundamentally, equal, then they are entitled, as of right, to an equal
<BR>
share of the good things of life. Capitalism will not submit: profits must be
<BR>
made, otherwise we go under. The richest rewards are in armaments: therefore,
<BR>
they will be produced and men will kill themselves much more efficiently that
<BR>
ever before. Politicians in the USA and elsewhere, are the product of a
<BR>
militarist/capitalist system: they have been educated within that philosophy
<BR>
and can see no other solution to the economic problems facing mankind. 
<BR>
<P>In the past, we have allowed self-interested, opportunistic politicians to
<BR>
trick us into thinking that they were interested in the public at large. Now
<BR>
is the time for working-class people, of all nations, to begin to think for
<BR>
ourselves and not merely to leave that to others, whom we have thought were
<BR>
cleverer than we ourselves. Now, more than ever before, is there a need for
<BR>
workers to unite against the enemy within. These are those puppets of
<BR>
International Capitalism who have been so busy undermining and destroying the
<BR>
essential rights and privileges of working-class people everywhere. We are
<BR>
still in the majority: we have the vote: we should, indeed, unite and elect
<BR>
representatives who will honestly and dutifully fulfill the mandate of the
<BR>
people. Those who profess to work for the people under the banner of a &quot;Labor&quot;
<BR>
Party will need to return to the traditional socialist policies of a Working-
<BR>
Class political party. The only alternative is the formation of new parties,
<BR>
dedicated to the establishment of socialist principles.&quot;
