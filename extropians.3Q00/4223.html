<P>
I've been thinking about the question of &quot;Bugs in Anarchy&quot; for a while
<BR>
now...  I've had a half-written e-mail in my outbox on the topic, and I
<BR>
figured that now would be as good a time as any to rewrite it and post
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>One interesting question is: &quot;Would anarcho-capitalism result in
<BR>
government?&quot;  David Friedman answers this objection from the
<BR>
perspective of an economist, and describes a potential situation in
<BR>
which the mafia decides to start its own government.
<BR>
<P>&quot;What about the possibility of the mafia getting its own protection
<BR>
agency?  In order for such a firm to provide its clients with the
<BR>
service they want -- protection against the consequences of their
<BR>
crimes -- it must either get the other protection agencies to agree to
<BR>
arbitration by a court that approves of crime or refuse to go to
<BR>
arbitration at all.  In order to do the first, it must offer the other
<BR>
agencies terms so good that their customers are willing to be stolen
<BR>
from; as in the previous case, this reduces to the thief bribing the
<BR>
victim by more than the amount stolen, which is improbable.  If it
<BR>
refuses to accept arbitration, then the mafia's protection agency
<BR>
finds itself constantly in conflict with the other protection
<BR>
agencies.  The victims of theft will be willing to pay more to be
<BR>
protected than the thieves will pay to be able to steal (since stolen
<BR>
goods are worth less to the thief than to the victim).  Therefore the
<BR>
noncriminal protection agencies will find it profitable to spend more
<BR>
to defeat the criminal agency than the criminal agency could spend to
<BR>
defeat them.  In effect, the criminals fight a hopeless war with the
<BR>
rest of society and are destroyed.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Certainly THIS plan, to win immunity from all crimes everywhere by
<BR>
bargaining with or crushing all who would oppose them, is hopeless.
<BR>
But the wanna-be-gov't need not fight a war against the world.  You
<BR>
might expect that they'd simply conquer as large an area as they think
<BR>
they could reasonably control, and reach equitable arbitration
<BR>
agreements with the other neighboring agencies.  If the other agencies
<BR>
happen to have the same idea, then you get a world consisting
<BR>
of... say... hundreds of nation states.
<BR>
<P>And rather than try to get their clients perfect immunity from the
<BR>
consequences of committing any crime whatsoever, they might only try
<BR>
to get immunity from certain crimes of limited scope, like, for
<BR>
example, stealing only a fraction (or even a majority) of its clients'
<BR>
property, rather than all of it.  Or stealing more from a clearly
<BR>
delineated minority than from the majority.
<BR>
<P>Finally, Friedman counts on the assumption that your taxes and freedom
<BR>
are worth more to you than they are to me.  But if I'm not taking away
<BR>
very MUCH freedom, many people would be willing to trade it away to me
<BR>
in exchange for money or other services; they could even trade away
<BR>
their right to leave such an arrangement if I sweetened the deal
<BR>
nicely.  This is more likely if I have a lust for Power (in and of
<BR>
itself, rather than as a means to an end) or if the people don't care
<BR>
about their freedom very much.
<BR>
<P>Especially in light of the fact that all of this is the actual result
<BR>
from an original state of nature, why wouldn't anarcho-capitalism go
<BR>
the same way?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From this perspective, it looks like the only ways to get to
</EM><BR>
anarcho-capitalism is the first place are:
<BR>
<P>1) some kind of technological advancement(s) that would make
<BR>
government significantly harder than it is today, like strong
<BR>
ubiquitous cryptography, cheap fast space travel coupled with
<BR>
functioning biospheres, uploading, which in turn may be counteracted
<BR>
by technological advancement(s) which could make government easier,
<BR>
like ubiquitous surveilance, long range weaponry, and neurohacking.
<BR>
<P>2) a strong ubiquitous yearning on the part of just about everyone
<BR>
everywhere for freedom, a desire which has no precedent in human history.
