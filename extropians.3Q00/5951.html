<P><EM>&gt; Well, excuuuuuse me. I guess I missed the &quot;SysOp&quot; lecture. I must have been in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; South Dakota that day. So how does that relate to AI friendliness? The robot is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mine because I bought it.
</EM><BR>
<P>As it gets brighter and more human level or surpasses us what makes you
<BR>
think that argument is going to look like anything but the mouthings of
<BR>
slave-holder to the AI?  You don't buy and sell conscious entities of
<BR>
human and greater level.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Robots are robots because they behave robotically. So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can't own humans. That robot came into being any way it could. It's a given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the purpose of discussing why AI would want to be friendly. The question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't how AI comes into being; it's why it would want to be friendly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Robots are self-defining if they are evolving toward and through human
<BR>
level. There is no such thing as preprogrammed immutable robotic
<BR>
behavior.  Can you program humans to be always friendly?  No?  Well you
<BR>
will have far less of a chance to do so with truly smart robots.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm beginning to think that you're rather good at trolling. No one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can't be that dense nondeliberately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sad to learn you think that way. But I don't recall you proposing any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constructive ideas about making AI friendly. So, to demonstrate that *you* are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not trolling, please let us in on your formula for insuring that AI would want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be friendly. If you don't think that AI would want to be friendly, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggests that you believe AI should not be attempted at all. In that case, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do you propose to keep AI from emerging?
</EM><BR>
<P>You miss the point.  There is no such insurance.  There are things that
<BR>
will make it more likely.  But utterly no guarantees.  AI and
<BR>
transhumans will develop and should simply because they are more
<BR>
intelligent and capable.  We would like to as much as possible set it up
<BR>
so they are, if not friendly, at least not out and out disasterous for
<BR>
us (although I plan to join them as much as possible personally).
