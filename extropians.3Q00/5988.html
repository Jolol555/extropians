<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I disagree.  Please show your argument that libertarianism, strong human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; rights, leads to anarchy or anarcho-capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It follows from the more individualist end of the libertarian philosophy, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the state's monopoly on force should end. When it ends, what replaces it? Most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people think chaos and barbarism when they think of the word anarchy, but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is just a deep meme they've been infected with continuously since childhood by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the entire power structure around them. It could not be further from the truth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Anarchy is not about chaos or lawlessness, it is about privatizing law and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; making its providers competitors in the market to provide the best justice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, your first sentence does not follow unless (at least) there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are no critical functions done by a state that cannot be done as well or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better by private parties.  But this is the core of the dispute.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that to successfully argue libertarianism leads to anarchy one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have to delineate all state functions and show for each that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be performed quite adequately and without producing as bad or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worse problems privately.  As bad or worse hinges around as bad or worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for individuals and individual rights being upheld.  Of course to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this comparison there also needs to be agreement on what individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights are and are not and even some meta-agreement on the core that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such rights grow out of.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it doesn't. You and I don't have the same auto insurance or health care
<BR>
policies, do we? Yet we still get along fine, and nobody is sending other
<BR>
people's kids to their deaths over car insurance, are they? The only common
<BR>
agreement by individuals in society is for each individual to respect and honor
<BR>
the contracts they agree to with other individuals, and to not initiate force
<BR>
against others. You and I don't have to want to exercise the same rights, so
<BR>
long as those rights either don't conflict, or don't conflict without just
<BR>
compensation. If I carry a firearm, and you don't, you are externalizing your
<BR>
security risk onto me to include you in the security umbrella that the implied
<BR>
threat my being armed provides (and the presence of a weapon does not constitute
<BR>
use of force, BTW). Such a scenario can be easily mitigated by a system of
<BR>
bounties or rewards in those instances when I do in fact take concrete actions
<BR>
to provide you with protection.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not see how multiplying the number of private law providers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcers actually makes life and cooperative, predicatable activity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more likely.  On the surface it seems to add extra levels of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complication.  Problems that did have on central body of law and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrators now have N such bodies.  These bodies act similarly to small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; States in this respect.  So domestic conflicts are escalated into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; international (er, inter-syndicate?) ones.
</EM><BR>
<P>Socialists do not see how multiplying the number of private product
<BR>
manufacturers and distributors actually makes life better, more cooperative and
<BR>
more efficient for all, which is why they simply DO NOT GET capitalism.
<BR>
Predictability is irrelevant, unless you are a fascist control freak. Adding
<BR>
complexity to systems (like markets) makes them more robust. Having n bodies of
<BR>
law ensures that if any one fails to serve adequately, the market for private
<BR>
law will resolve the issue bloodlessly, allowing consumers to obtain their law
<BR>
from bodies of law which do provide adequate levels of justice.
