Bryan/Brian exchanged thus:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Do you agree that these instincts are built into their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; brains by DNA?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but most aren't as high-level as &quot;big antlers&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So why can't there also be instincts to want to have sex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with big antlers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Encoding &quot;big antlers&quot; is more like encoding symphonies in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heartbeats than encoding a heart...
</EM><BR>
<P>I am surprised there is left any doubt that sexual preferences
<BR>
are hard wired into our brains by some mysterious means.
<BR>
This is a very important point in the understanding of survival
<BR>
selection vs sex selection.  If understood as two completely
<BR>
different phenomena, we can explain why there seem to exist
<BR>
sexual preferences that can actually work *against* optimal
<BR>
survival, such as the elk and his ilk, with the oversized antlers,
<BR>
and the peacock's heavy and possibly predator-attracting
<BR>
tail feathers, and oversized human brains.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, Charles Darwin presented these two evolutionary
<BR>
influences as two distinct forces in his Descent of Man in 1871.
<BR>
In fact, two thirds of that book is dedicated to sex selection.
<BR>
For the sake of argument, let me include contingency as a
<BR>
factor in evolution.  Then we might imagine three cases:
<BR>
<P>1) some environmentally-stressed species in which survival
<BR>
selection is the dominant driver,
<BR>
<P>2)  species such as alligators or sea turtles where survival
<BR>
seems driven by contingency (lotsa eggs hatched, a very few
<BR>
lucky survivors), and
<BR>
<P>3)  other species such as humans, where nearly all individuals
<BR>
that are born live to reproductive age.  In the third case, is not
<BR>
sex selection practically alone in the evolutionary driver's seat?
<BR>
<P>In the near future, I will post a notion that ties together my
<BR>
recent interest in evolution with the posts on the future of
<BR>
military force as expressed in the reams of national missile
<BR>
defense and the posts on negative and positive feedback
<BR>
loops, and the relationship of all this with the singularity.
<BR>
Really.  spike
