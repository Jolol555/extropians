<EM> &gt;From: &quot;phil osborn&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:philosborn@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Responsibility%20for%20children&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000918044928.23136.cpmta@c012.sfo.cp.net&gt;">philosborn@hotmail.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM> &gt;But.... There isn't any &quot;child&quot; at the point of conception. There's just
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;an embryo, which, if it gets a huge amount of biosupport for 9 months,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;might
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;eventually make it to the point of being a child. The point at which one
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;can talk about a child is certainly uncertain at our current state of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;understanding of the scientific/medical/ethical issues, screwed up as they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;are by all the religious nonsense and propaganda, but I can state with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;great
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;certainty that it doesn't qualify as a child at conception, nor at one
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;week,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nor at one month, nor at three months. After that, the level of certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;starts dropping.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's no &quot;certainty&quot; to it at all. What you have stated is nothing more
<BR>
than your own personal and arbitrary belief. (It also happens to be my
<BR>
belief as well, but that's beside the point.) The point is that there are
<BR>
no criteria by which it can objectively and inconclusively be determined
<BR>
where a human-potentiality ends and a human-being begins. The only point
<BR>
where *everyone* will agree that there is not yet a human is just before
<BR>
sperm breaches egg. After that, we've got nothing better than &quot;I believe
<BR>
this&quot; and &quot;You believe that.&quot;
<BR>
<P>So if society conducts itself according to *your* belief that a 3 month old
<BR>
fetus is mere biological rubbish which can be disposed of without a second
<BR>
thought, then when society changes its mind about when a fetus becomes a
<BR>
human, or if objective (biological or ethical) criteria are ever established
<BR>
which show that you drew the line in the wrong part of the sand, then it may
<BR>
well turn out that, following your lead, society is a bigger genocidal
<BR>
criminal than Hitler could ever have hoped to be.
<BR>
<P><P>I realize that this is much like the debate over the number of angels that
<BR>
can dance on the head of a pin, but the point is that you are arguing from
<BR>
*your* beliefs, not from any objective or empirical criteria. So at best
<BR>
you (and I) can only argue for what we personally believe and conduct our
<BR>
own personal behaviors accordingly. When you start basing *societal* policy
<BR>
on your own ethical/moral beliefs, you are no better (and no worse) than the
<BR>
pro-lifers who would do away with abortion altogether because of *their*
<BR>
belief that, once sperm meets egg, its a human - and anyone who harms the
<BR>
fetus, batters a human being.
<BR>
-Zero
<BR>
<P>My goodness.  I certainly hope that you don't try to live your life on the 
<BR>
basis that you just stated.  I'm even more certain of that, actually, than 
<BR>
that an embryo is a human being, as you certainly could not have survived 
<BR>
if that was your actual working decision process.
<BR>
<P>We KNOW that an embryo is not a human being, any more than the epithelial 
<BR>
cells flaking off the interior of my mouth are human beings - altho they 
<BR>
certainly have that potential, given proper cloning and surogate womb 
<BR>
tech.  Should we follow your lead, we would have to out-Janist the Janists, 
<BR>
with their face masks to avoid killing some airborn germ that might have 
<BR>
been their great grandmother.
<BR>
<P>In treating even a six-month-old fetus as a human being, one is being 
<BR>
really generous.  Baby chicks probably have much more real working 
<BR>
intelligence.  It is really hard to make a conclusive case for personhood 
<BR>
until a year or so after birth.  Even then year-old chimps, great apes in 
<BR>
general, and several of the parrot species, as well as ravens are probably 
<BR>
quite a bit more intelligent than most year old humans.
<BR>
<P>I suppose that is as much an argument for granting a fairly large group of 
<BR>
&quot;lower&quot; animals rights as it is for denying them to infants.  But, there is 
<BR>
a difference.  Rights are not some altruistic luxury handed down from God 
<BR>
on high.
<BR>
<P>A rational explanation of rights, such as Ayn Rand presents - or the 
<BR>
slightly better version of her position found in the Tannehill's &quot;The 
<BR>
Market for Liberty,&quot; bases them on our mutual self interest.  Rights are a 
<BR>
bottom line representation of the mutual recognitions that allow us to live 
<BR>
together in piece.  We are valuable to each other.  99% of the value of our 
<BR>
lives probably is there due to the contribution of other people.
<BR>
<P>A &quot;right&quot; is a moral prohibition against interference with our 
<BR>
actions.  Every word in that definition is essential.  It isn't just a 
<BR>
prohibition; it's a &quot;moral&quot; prohibition, meaning that it can be justified 
<BR>
according to a standard of values, a value being something one acts to gain 
<BR>
or keep.  The only standard which is not self-contradictory is life itself 
<BR>
(how can you follow a standard of values if you are dead?).  Rights are 
<BR>
simply a recognition of what it takes to follow that standard of value in 
<BR>
our dealings with each other.
<BR>
<P>A &quot;person&quot; of whatever age, sex, or species (chimp, homo-sapiens (actually 
<BR>
a subspecies of chimpanzee), dolphin, or SI) could in theory make the 
<BR>
argument that they have rights because they fit the above category - their 
<BR>
lives and ours are fundamentally mutually beneficial, largely because we 
<BR>
can think rationally and communicate, allowing us to organize and form 
<BR>
relationships that leverage and multiply our individual capabilities.
<BR>
<P>(Just based on the above, someone could presumeably misgeneralize the 
<BR>
argument to say that since trees and humans are also mutually beneficial, 
<BR>
we have to recognize that trees have rights.  It is in my advantage however 
<BR>
to cut down trees, without regard for their individual interests, whereas 
<BR>
the same behavior done to other persons will have many permanent negative 
<BR>
consequences, as well as ignoring that it is the security in their own 
<BR>
rights that is the very thing that makes the other persons so valuable to 
<BR>
me.  That does not apply to trees, cows, or other non-persons.)
<BR>
<P>If they are not a &quot;person,&quot; then they cannot make that 
<BR>
argument.  Borderline cases would be an infant or a  chimp that learned 
<BR>
Ameslan or a very smart parrot that demonstrated that it could recognize 
<BR>
our rights as well as communicate.
