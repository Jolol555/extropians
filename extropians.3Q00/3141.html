<P><EM>        &gt; GATT has IP provisions, I suggest you read it.
</EM><BR>
<P>It may have IP provisions, maybe, but I doubt anybody pays any attention to them.
<BR>
And as the USA is the most important member I doubt it has anything in it that would
<BR>
violate the first amendment as this would. The second any attempt was made to actually
<BR>
do something rather than just write a pretty treaty a USA court would shoot it down.
<BR>
<P>And is it even there?  Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places but I've been unable to find
<BR>
anything that supports your claim that &quot;countries that refuse to accept WIPO rulings get
<BR>
electronically embargoed&quot;. No country has ever been &quot;electronically embargoed&quot;, not China,
<BR>
not Cuba, not Iraq, not Iran, not North Korea, if information was restricted it was done from their
<BR>
side not our side. I find it impossible to believe all countries would agree on such a ruling, even if
<BR>
they did I find it impossible to believe all would agree on the interpretation of such a ruling,
<BR>
even if they did I find it impossible to believe they'd be able to enforce it. All it would take is
<BR>
for one other country to use a liberal interpretation of the word &quot;restriction&quot; and the floodgates
<BR>
would be open.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;remove those countries top level domains from recognition on
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;servers and routers
</EM><BR>
<P>.com  .org  .net
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;bill the software author for all royalties unpaid as a result of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;using his/her software.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Are you saying that if piracy was impossible people with tons of illegal software
<BR>
would have gone to the store and bought the stuff ?!
<BR>
<P><EM>         &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>         &gt;&gt;Are you going to jail the maker of a word processing
</EM><BR>
<EM>         &gt;&gt; program because somebody used it to write a ransom note?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; That is not what we are talking about, and you ought to know that.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's exactly what we're talking about and I do know it.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; People that write software like napster, which their main function is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; facilitate IP piracy,
</EM><BR>
<P>Napster is a new way to distribute information, nothing more. I was just reading in
<BR>
Science about using a Napster clone for scientific data instead of MP3's.
<BR>
Any program can have legal and illegal uses.
