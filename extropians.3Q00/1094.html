<EM>&gt;This suggests to me that uploading won't be something that happens off

<EM>&gt;in a lab somewhere without anyone caring until success is achieved.

<P>What if the first upload is a cryonics patient, who is legally &quot;dead&quot;?
<BR>
What about the apparent majority today who can't accept a machine
<BR>
being &quot;conscious&quot;?  What if the first upload company keeps their uploads
<BR>
from talking with and interacting with ordinary people in &quot;human&quot; ways?
<BR>
(Software just does useful things; you can't see how.)  And what if
<BR>
you can make *trillions* of dollars selling such software service?
<BR>
Won't that motivate them to do what ever paperwork/lobbying it takes?
<BR>
<P>It might not be right, but people can be remarkably blind when it
<BR>
suits them.  They might not see the uploads if that would make trouble.
<BR>
<P>If you were going to spend a billion dollars to upload someone in the
<BR>
hope of selling billions of copies of that upload, who would you upload?
<BR>
Someone smart, sure, and &quot;tough&quot; to handle the big changes, but there's
<BR>
lots of tough smart people.  It seems to me that you'd look for someone
<BR>
&quot;meek&quot; to inherit the earth.  Someone who can accept a modest lifestyle,
<BR>
and just do their job smoothly and without calling attention to them.
<BR>
Someone who can accept being turned off when the need arises.  Someone
<BR>
who would not think of complaining or revolting as long as they were
<BR>
treated reasonably, and who won't trigger people's fears of strange
<BR>
ambitious machine intelligences.  Someone who fit people's subconscious
<BR>
image of a docile servant whose proper place in the world is to help
<BR>
you when you ask and then fade into the background.  Might sell many
<BR>
billions of those.  The meek may well inherit the earth.
