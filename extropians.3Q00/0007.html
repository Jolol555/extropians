<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;thing to want to make humans as perfect as possible.  But it seems like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virtually everywhere else, the E word is as bad as the N word.  Why is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've wondered about that ever since I read about Heinlein's &quot;Howard
<BR>
Families&quot; and wondered why exactly anyone would think there was anything
<BR>
wrong with that?
<BR>
<P>As near as I can tell, when someone says &quot;eugenics&quot;, everyone reads a whole
<BR>
lot into it that isn't necessarily there.
<BR>
<P>The historical eugenics programs, as practiced, well, just about everywhere
<BR>
(US, Canada, and a disturbing number of Western European countries, anyways)
<BR>
in the 20's and 30's, involved the coercive sterilization of persons deemed
<BR>
to be mentally &quot;unfit&quot;. The definition of &quot;unfit&quot; varied quite dramatically
<BR>
from place to place. For example, the Nazis included Jewishness in their
<BR>
definition. The &quot;civilized&quot; world did not. but I digress. :)
<BR>
<P>Now obviously, the genetic manipulation of a population can be carried out
<BR>
in at least two different ways.Method 1)  You can prevent the &quot;bad&quot; genes
<BR>
from spreading, via the aforementioned sterilization. This is, I think we'd
<BR>
all agree, a Bad Thing (tm). What never seems even to get brought up in
<BR>
eugenics discussions is Method 2): &quot;merely&quot; encouraging the propagation of
<BR>
the &quot;good&quot; genes, via a system of monetary, matieriel or spiritual
<BR>
incentives. The Howard Families, from Heinlein's &quot;Future History&quot;, used
<BR>
large monetary incentives to encourage the children of members of the group
<BR>
to become members themselves.
<BR>
<P>Has anybody ever tried an experiment like this, using fruit flies or lab
<BR>
rats or something? Mr. Skrecky? You've been doing fruit fly longevity
<BR>
experiments for as long as I've been a list member. Did you ever try
<BR>
breeding any of the hardier groups?
<BR>
<P>(Probably not. As I recall you've been doing destruction testing. Oh well.)
<BR>
<P>Returning to lurk mode...
