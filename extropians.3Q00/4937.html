<P><EM> &gt; I am not sure what your objection is exactly.  With nanotech on the
</EM><BR>
<P>You must be relatively new here, we've been talking about this for
<BR>
quite a while. Alas, our archives are notoriously broken. Somebody,
<BR>
somewhen has to make a few copies of a cleanly hypermailed and
<BR>
full-text indexed archive (I hope the original mailboxes do still
<BR>
exist). It would be a pity if all of this has eventually to go to the
<BR>
big bit bucket in the sky.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; horizon we will most likely be in abundance mode on earth for most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; physical goods within the next 4-5 decades. All things are relative. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, consider a being processing information at a time scale of
<BR>
10^3..10^6 times faster than you. It can be (much) smarter or (much)
<BR>
dumber than a human. At least originally it has been probably created
<BR>
with a clean hardware/software separation (it might or might not keep
<BR>
it, and I don't know what will happen if it won't). The thing is a bit
<BR>
pattern which becomes a being in the right context. (In analogy to the
<BR>
wet DNA world, it can grow from a much smaller and simpler
<BR>
nucleus). The bit pattern is mobile, and, depending on complexity, can
<BR>
be copied to a new substrate on ~ms..~s time scale. There is
<BR>
competition for resources, we're in Darwinian regime. Clearly there is
<BR>
a propagation bottleneck: the speed with which you can restructure the
<BR>
matter (whether on a patch of land or a space region filled with
<BR>
metabolizable debris or a large planetary body with a minable surface)
<BR>
is very small in comparison to the actual copy burst.
<BR>
<P>This is bottleneck one: you must restructure the environment first,
<BR>
before you can expand.
<BR>
<P>Now if you do the math, you'll find that despite the subjective
<BR>
glacial slowness of expansion, on human time scale you can overgrow
<BR>
Earth surface in days to weeks -- using existing organic material and
<BR>
(possibly extraterrestrially boosted) insolation for energy. Earth
<BR>
surface is limited in size, and right now we don't know any gentle
<BR>
ways to dismantle it in a short time frame to turn trapped volume into
<BR>
lots of new surface, but our successors in their search for new
<BR>
lebensraum certainly will. Meanwhile, we'll turn to space. Now there
<BR>
is a lot of kinetically accessible mass in Kuiper, Oort, the asteroid
<BR>
belt bodies and the little airless rocks like the Moon and
<BR>
Mercury. And one certainly can ablate the atmosphere of Mars, or
<BR>
simply ignore it, as it is relatively thin. Gas giants will be hard,
<BR>
but they'll be probably considered fuel, anyway.
<BR>
<P>The end of this little narrative is that on a time frame much less
<BR>
than geological, every loose bit of useful material in the solar
<BR>
system will eventually serve its purpose, being part of some critter
<BR>
in the local food chain, (or encoding some critter in the local food
<BR>
chain, though munching crunchy circuits will probably always make
<BR>
sense).
<BR>
<P>This is bottleneck two: there is only that much atoms and energy
<BR>
entropy gradient in a given solar system.
<BR>
<P>As interstellar travel is expensive (even encoded as photons, or
<BR>
relativistic little matter packet streams), most critters (and people
<BR>
and gods) have to stay here, and prey on each other or figure out some
<BR>
less gory arrangement. Gods will have a lot more to say than
<BR>
phytoplancton or people, but they're far from being omnipotent, even
<BR>
if we knew what their motivation would be (we don't).
<BR>
<P>This is bottleneck three: travel is expensive, and potential
<BR>
production rate of beings in a given volume far exceeds how many of
<BR>
them could leave the given volume through it's surface, assuming no
<BR>
unknown physics.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Did you think I was talking about some free-floating absolute or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; something?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Of course. Why bothering with trivia ;)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; Non-interference? Jeez, a yet another believer in the tooth
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; fairy. Have you ever seen an ecology go into non-interference mode?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Not in the least what I am talking about.  Please attempt to read a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; more carefully and please keep gratuitous insults to yourself.  I am
</EM><BR>
<P>I did read what you wrote, and sorry if my little yelps of
<BR>
exasperation offended you.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; talking about human beings and their proclivities to attempt to run each
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; other's lifes not about ecology in general or any other broader context. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You seem to think that human beings, even transformed and radiated
<BR>
human beings are something standing apart, not part of the big merry
<BR>
olde rat race. If beings make imperfect copies of itself in a limited
<BR>
resource (see above) context, you form an co-evolutionary ecology,
<BR>
whether you want it, or not. The competition is always there
<BR>
(intraspecies aggression can become uglier than interspecies), and the
<BR>
form it takes depends on how smart the critters are. Since after the
<BR>
radiation you'll be getting the full spectrum of complexity, they'll
<BR>
be certainly enough mayhem left to make you puke.
<BR>
<P>The big hedonistic engineer sysop in the sky idea is certainly
<BR>
touching, but, how to put it politely, based on a rather selective
<BR>
perception of reality. Do not see it happen, and implementing the
<BR>
hedonistic imperative does seem to clash with a few gears and cogs of
<BR>
how sustainably stable systems work in the real world.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; There are always good reasons to keep secrets.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The questions are of what kinds, how much and for what reasons. 
</EM><BR>
<P>If I know a lot of things about you, I can predict what you're going
<BR>
to do next, and use that to my advantage. Hence, it is always a good
<BR>
idea to hold crucial information back, cooperation, or no.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Knowledge and information tends to grow faster when the information is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; shared or at least relatively open.  At least in areas where information
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't really buy the &quot;universe strives to maximize the amount of
<BR>
information&quot; jingle. There might be some larger scale pattern working
<BR>
that way, but so far I see no evidence for it. If anybody knows a few
<BR>
papers on laws that govern ecologies as systems processing information
<BR>
(no linear log plots seem to be lurking there), please drop me a few
<BR>
pointers.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; is built upon like in software, sciences, technological process and so
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; on.  There is an argument possible there that the speed of our growth is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; proportional to the degree the information flows relatively freely and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to the degree of freedom the recipients have to utilize it.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You see a very brief snapshot, choose from it rather selectively, and
<BR>
extrapolate it quite boldly. 1% of your genome are incorporated
<BR>
(partly or fully functional dormant) retroviruses. There are more
<BR>
bacteria on your body than it has cells, and the biodiversity in a
<BR>
typical suburbian or city neighbourhood is but a tiny fraction of what
<BR>
would have been normally found there.
<BR>
<P>Of course this is again a infinitesimally brief snapshot, so I won't
<BR>
try to make any extrapolations on that, attempting to assess the
<BR>
information content of, say, Britney Spears vs. an annelid. The trend
<BR>
will probably still go up, and overcompensate for the current hole.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; Paradise will never be, period.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Exactly why do you say that?  I will certainly not simply take your word
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for it.  Relative paradise certainly will be.  There is a question of
</EM><BR>
<P>Paradise seems intrinsically absolute, and even relative paradise must
<BR>
be necessarily small. Being John Malkovich is probably more fun than
<BR>
being R. rattus in a rice paddy somewhere, but even he doesn't live in
<BR>
perpetual bliss.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; degree.  Do you think we are in endless competition mode regardless of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; what technologies and changes in ourselves and our environment we make? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course. It's the competion that ultimatively drives us to a higher
<BR>
fitness. Without co-evolution, we would still be ursoup merrily
<BR>
lapping the beaches of a lifeless planet. I don't know whether it
<BR>
would have sucked more, ursoup doesn't feel much.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If so, then what gives you your certainty?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
1) Imperfect 2) replication in face of 3) limited resources. Harsh,
<BR>
but inventive.
