<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have read Prof. Lorry's (:-)) comment on this and I can only mildly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disagree with what he says.   I've seen no peer reviewed paper that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;says you cannot disassemble stars or that disassembling them produces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supernovas.  Criswell's stellar husbandry (aka star lifting) approach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(which I have online copies of if someone wants it), to my knowledge has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not been disproven.  
</EM><BR>
<P>David R. Criswell, yes? 
<BR>
<P>sidetracking --
<BR>
<P>I just put the pieces together that he is the same D.R. Criswell that
<BR>
did so much work on the electrostatic transport of lunar dust in the
<BR>
70s. He's kind of famous for that work.
<BR>
<P>Criswell, D.R., chapter &quot;Horizon-glow and the motion of lunar dust&quot;,
<BR>
in _Photon and Particle Interactions with Surfaces in Space_,
<BR>
ed. R.Grard, Reidel, 1973. and many more papers....
<BR>
<P>Electrostatic dust transport on the Moon was first envisioned by
<BR>
T. Gold in 1955 and then later, after the Surveyor 5,6,7 spacecraft
<BR>
missions, the topic was embraced again by D.R. Criswell and co-workers
<BR>
to explain some features seen in the lunar images. In those images, a
<BR>
western horizon glow was observed following the local sunset. The most
<BR>
likely explanation for the glow in the images is forward-scattered
<BR>
sunlight by a cloud of dust particles, less than about 10 microns in
<BR>
radii, migrating away from the sunlit hemisphere of the moon. The
<BR>
cloud is created from tiny particles, levitated above (a few to a few
<BR>
tens of centimeters) the lunar surface, the levitation caused by
<BR>
repulsive forces between the charged particles and the extremely low-
<BR>
electrically- conductive lunar surface.
<BR>
<P>back to starlifting --
<BR>
<P>The paper that you (Robert) have by Criswell, is this the same as the
<BR>
chapter: &quot;Solar System Industrialization Implications for Interstellar
<BR>
Migrations&quot; in the book: _Interstellar Migration and Human
<BR>
Experience_? I've skimmed the chapter, but I need to read it in more
<BR>
detail.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have seen suggestions (hints?) that as Michael
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;says, this may age the star prematurely.  I think it depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether or not the star has ignited its helium burning cycle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(which is what turns it into a red giant).  If all the star is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing is burning H into He, then, removing the outer mass should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decompress the core and allow the star to shift down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;luminosity curve (G--&gt;K--&gt;M--&gt;L).  You may have to do it *very*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slowly to allow the star to adjust.  I suspect there may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some additional complexity depending on the degree to which the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;star is losing heat primarily through radiation or convection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(which may depend on its mass and perhaps metalicity).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Perhaps if Amara reads this at some point she could comment.
</EM><BR>
<P>email is not such a reliable method to reach me these months
<BR>
(PhD endpoint near), phone and in person is better.
<BR>
<P><P>What I see missed in this discussion, after main sequence, is that
<BR>
nuclear burning is also (possibly/likely) occurring *IN THE SHELL OF
<BR>
THE STAR* too, depending on the star's mass.
<BR>
<P>Starting from stellar evolution just after main sequence:
<BR>
<P>(stating references: here I use info from a helioseismologist from
<BR>
Aarhus, DK named Jorgen Christensen_Dalsgaard, &quot;Lecture notes:
<BR>
Stellar Structure and Evolution&quot;, an 1995 edition of his notes which
<BR>
he gave me in 1997, while I was still working for the Stanford solar
<BR>
oscillations group)
<BR>
<P>Hydrogen is exhausted near the center, and the star is left with a
<BR>
core consisting of helium and a small amount of heavy elements.
<BR>
Initially the temperature of the core is far below the 10^8K required
<BR>
for helium ignition, and there is no nuclear energy generation in the
<BR>
core -- the temperature is almost isothermal.
<BR>
<P>Surrounding the core is a region containing hydrogen where the
<BR>
temperature is still high enough for hydrogen burning to proceed.
<BR>
This region is the &quot;hydrogen shell source&quot;, and it provides the energy
<BR>
from which the luminosity of the star is derived. As the hydrogen is
<BR>
converted to helium in the shell source, the mass of the inert helium
<BR>
core increases. This leads to contraction of the core, which releases
<BR>
gravitational potential energy, part of which goes towards increasing
<BR>
the thermal core energy. And so the process continues, until the
<BR>
temperature of the core is sufficiently high for helium burning to
<BR>
begin.
<BR>
<P>So then very roughly, the process is repeated: the star burns helium
<BR>
in the core (while still maintaining a hydrogen shell source) until
<BR>
helium is exhausted; the star then has a contracting core consisting
<BR>
of 12C and 16O, surrounded by a helium shell source and a hydrogen
<BR>
shell source; the contraction of the core may proceed up to the point
<BR>
where the temperature is high enough for carbon ignition; and so on.
<BR>
<P>Christensen_Dalsgaard says that this sketch leaves out a lot of
<BR>
&quot;fascinating detail&quot;. In particular, the response of the observable
<BR>
properties of the star to the changes in the core. He said that the
<BR>
response of the star can be understood in terms of a simple principle:
<BR>
<P>THE SHELL-BURNING LAW: When the region within a burning shell
<BR>
contracts, the region outside the shell expands; and when the region
<BR>
inside the shell expands, the region outside the shell contracts.
<BR>
<P>This rule appears to apply also in some cases where there are two
<BR>
shell-burning regions present.
<BR>
<P>How can one have two shell sources?
<BR>
<P>For a moderate mass star, say 5*M_sol, the picture proceeds as
<BR>
above. Helium burning is established in the core, and the contraction
<BR>
of the surface stops, and the star enters an extended period of core
<BR>
helium burning. However even during this phase, the hydrogen shell
<BR>
source contributes a substantial part of the energy. Helium is
<BR>
converted into carbon and oxygen The mean molecular weight of material
<BR>
in the core increases. The shell-burning law operates, causing the
<BR>
envelope to expand. When helium is exhausted in the core, helium
<BR>
burning is established in a shell, while hydrogen shell burning
<BR>
continues; hence the star has two shell sources.
<BR>
<P>The more massive the star, the more shell-burning sources exist.
<BR>
Kippenhahn and Weigert, 1990 have a nice schematic illustration of the
<BR>
&quot;onion-shell&quot; structure in the interior of a highly evolved massive
<BR>
star, showing the burning processes proceeding in the various shells,
<BR>
and the resulting composition. Also note that the late stages of
<BR>
stellar evolution are very rapid, compared to the hydrogen and helium
<BR>
phases. Oxygen burning only lasts of order 6 months. &quot;Silicon-burning&quot;
<BR>
is finished in about a day. So therefore the probability of observing
<BR>
a star while in these later evolutionary phases is very small.
