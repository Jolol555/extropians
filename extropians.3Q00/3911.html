Subject: Re: Nietzsche (transhumanist philosopher)
<BR>
<P>Steve Nichols has written,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Aren't the various supernaturalists, including Moh all the bearded
</EM><BR>
prophets, holding many of us back in the human era?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The post-human period starts with median vision theory (MVT) and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution of the &quot;hard problem&quot; in western philosophy, and the resulting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparency through understanding of modern self-referential
</EM><BR>
consciousness,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and is a state of mind rather than any technological improvement (these
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; incremental and have been going on throughout human history).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Okay, thank you for the clarification, Steve. So, in answer to you
</EM><BR>
question, No,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;enlightened masters do not hold us back in the human era. They allow us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transcend our animal instincts to reach our full potential.
</EM><BR>

<BR>
<P>Sure but I am against supernaturalism, not &quot;enlightenment.&quot; I would propose
<BR>
David Hume to the list
<BR>
(prime mover of the Scottish Enlightenment) .... he was a ground-breaking
<BR>
atheist philosopher with
<BR>
much more of substance to him than Nietzsche, who was only good for a few
<BR>
soundbites!
<BR>
<P>how can be  &quot;enlightened&quot; and hold false beliefs, such as in God &amp; an
<BR>
after-life?
<BR>
I would accept Buddha as 'post-human' since he is anti-dogmatic, but not
<BR>
Mohammed (although I never met the bloke, and I'm sure he was a great guy).
