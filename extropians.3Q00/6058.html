EUGENE SAID: &quot;...AI@home type of projects using above technologies
<BR>
should be outlawed....&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Eugene it won't work. Betcha writing hyperintelligent AI is more
<BR>
addictive than heroin. If you can't stop people from writing klutzy computer
<BR>
viruses - how are you going to stop them from writing AI?
<BR>
<P>And ...AI doesn't have to be very smart to be ultra destructive. The human
<BR>
authour just has to be a psychopath, is all.
<BR>
<P>EUGENE SAID: &quot;...If I knew someone is about to succeed in building a &gt;H AI
<BR>
or a gray goo autoreplicator before we're ready for it, despite an universal
<BR>
moratorium I would nuke him without a second thought.
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: If he were a physical &amp; sovereign state, maybe. But such a
<BR>
strategy hasn't been deployed with the drug production of Andean South
<BR>
America... and I daresay it never will. Far less for, say, 20,000 or so 21
<BR>
year olds scattered through university dorms and living rooms the world
<BR>
over.
<BR>
<P>If it's possible - then humans may have to live with its inevitability.
<BR>
<P>You may even see a whole cult of mind hackers by 2010. Whole multi terabyte
<BR>
hard drives (...or whatever...) with seriously camouflage-encrypted binaries
<BR>
that are decrypted on the fly. The cult of superhuman intelligence is
<BR>
enthralling... once it is practically realizeable - it will become a
<BR>
religion.
<BR>
<P>Do you think you can fight religion? And win?
<BR>
<P>You're talking about the &quot;Artilect Wars&quot; all over again. But this is a
<BR>
dirty, Vietnam-style war.... where people defend their God-given &quot;right&quot; to
<BR>
create God with a seething, righteous passion. Should be fun if you're into
<BR>
war.
