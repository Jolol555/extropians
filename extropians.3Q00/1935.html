<EM>&gt; I passed on this customer reaction to Steve at Fictionwise, who made the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following response, which he's allowed me to repost here: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ============= 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An ebook should be priced a little lower than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; print edition, but not at &quot;a fraction&quot; of the cost. (Unless the fraction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are talking about is 9/10.)  The printing costs for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a physical paper back book are only about $1 out of a list price here in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the usa of about $8. So by any reasonable logic the price should be about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10 percent less for an ebook with the same content. What people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paying for is the *content* not much the package.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I was saying, electronic commerce, in terms of its true costs (not counting
<BR>
the costs of hyping your dot com), I put forward these facts I just gleaned from
<BR>
Operations &amp; Fulfillment Magazine (www.opsandfulfillment.com), the July/August
<BR>
2000 newstand issue, on page 10:
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; Contact Sport
<BR>
Don't pooh-pooh the trend toward renaming call centers &quot;customers contact
<BR>
centers&quot; - the contact, of course being mostly electronic. By 2001, about a
<BR>
quarter of all customer interaction will occur by email or through the web. At a
<BR>
recent CRM show, sofware provider Davox Corp estimated that the worldwide
<BR>
customer contact center market (yes, its now a 'market' in its own right) will
<BR>
reach $14 billion by 2003, with sales of customer interaction sofware totalling
<BR>
$2.9 billion. A compound annual growth rate of 23.4% will make this the second
<BR>
fastest growing software category. Heres what Giga Information Group says some
<BR>
options will cost you for each customer contact, including agent time and
<BR>
infrastructure:
<BR>
<P>Live Operator $10.00
<BR>
Interactive voice response $6.00
<BR>
Manual email or fax $3.00
<BR>
Automated email (typical means of ecommerce purchase authorization) $0.25  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>So what we are talking about here is a 40 times reduction in the in-house
<BR>
overhead cost for each order, compared to the traditional mail order business
<BR>
(which has a smaller overhead cost than retail book sellers).
