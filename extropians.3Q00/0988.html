</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, back to mooses or meese.  Im trying to reframe this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole evolutionary argument in terms of something I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trained in, feedback control loops.  With the big antlers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example I am postulating a positive feedback loop that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; envelopes a negative feedback loop.  If we can model
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the only two mechanisms for population genetic drift,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survival selection and mate selection, in terms of negative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and positive feedback loops, then evolution can be simulated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a computer.  All that is known in the field of feedback
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control systems (which is a lot)  will be accessible to the field
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of evolution studies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we manage to do that, evolution becomes far more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; satisfying than a lotta pointless theoretical ruminations.  We will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be given a means of actually testing our notions, experimentation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like the up-coming missile intercept attempt, the long-winded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophical arguments get an exclamation point at the end,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not just a period; or as often the case with evolutionary theory,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a comma.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>One point of negative feedback for moose antler size is the average width of
<BR>
dispersion between trees in the forest. Moose living in areas of more mature
<BR>
forests with more space between trees will grow larger antlers because there is
<BR>
room to, up to a point. Then there is the density/mass issue, since Moose are
<BR>
partly aquatic, in that they feed in swampy muddy areas, and frequently swim
<BR>
across bodies of water. Too much bone dedicated to antler growth detracts from
<BR>
bouyancy, and will trap moose in deep mud. Then there is also a stress of the
<BR>
added antler weight on the neck vertebrae and neck muscles, increased caloric
<BR>
consumption for same, as well as body heat losses through the antlers increasing
<BR>
caloric expenditures. Moose in heavily hunted areas will eventually evolve
<BR>
smaller antlers, since the emphasis of at least a portion of the hunters will be
<BR>
on the trophy value of the rack.
