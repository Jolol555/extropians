<P>
Emlyn, I've tried to reduce your argument to its essence so we can focus
<BR>
this discussion as tightly as possible. You wrote:
<BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Don't get me wrong; I don't oppose any of the technologies being developed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I take issue only with the top level goals in some cases. Particularly,
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM>&gt;goal of godhood leads to an arrogance which I can't condone. It leads to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believing that you know better than the other six billion people kicking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around on this planet, and that can direct actions which are not morally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supportable; for instance, the attempt to build a guardian - I haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;noticed any step in the plans for such creations, which involves obtaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;broad consensus before &quot;flicking the switch&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are defining godhood as authority presumptively assumed by a powerful
<BR>
being.
<BR>
<P>I am defining godhood as the result of empowering technologies that thrust
<BR>
godly levels of responsibility upon us. We want to achieve every
<BR>
Transhumanist potential we can, and a by-product of doing so is that we
<BR>
become like the gods of myth.
<BR>
<P>I've dealt with the issue of guardians in a previous post. &quot;Who guards the
<BR>
guardians?&quot; is still the operant concern. You are worried that someone might
<BR>
create an AI guardian (or perhaps augment themselves to become a Transhuman
<BR>
guardian) without first seeking consensus or permission. I understand why
<BR>
you would be worried about this, given humanity's checkered history,
<BR>
especially in the 20th century, of bloody dictators and their cults of
<BR>
personality. Yet I see no way to prevent any sufficiently bright, determined
<BR>
and capitalized person from doing what you fear. What to do?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Also, we are playing with fire...&lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>We should fight fire with fire. If we cannot prevent anyone else from
<BR>
achieving godly levels of power and abusing that achievement, then WE must
<BR>
strive to achieve it and use it rightly.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;It's been discussed on the list just how dangerous some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coming technologies are (ai, nanotech, etc), and if you go over the posts,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you'll see that most of the danger is attributed to use of that technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by humans infected with the God meme. People who think that they know
</EM><BR>
better
<BR>
<EM>&gt;than everyone else, who feel justified in producing externalities (like
</EM><BR>
grey
<BR>
<EM>&gt;goo).
</EM><BR>
<P>The God meme was not behind the monumental crimes against humanity committed
<BR>
by the Communists and Nazis. Quite the opposite, in fact. What you are
<BR>
actually worried about is the human capacity for evil. Evil acts are always
<BR>
justified by appealing to whatever meme is most handy, whether that is &quot;the
<BR>
people&quot; or &quot;the race&quot; or &quot;God.&quot; Eliminate your fixation on the God meme,
<BR>
substitute human evil for it within your argument, and it appears that your
<BR>
concerns (and presumed solution) becomes essentially the same as Bill Joy's.
<BR>
Am I correct about that? Do you think we should relinquish AI, nanotech, and
<BR>
genetic engineering? Or am I not presenting your ideas correctly?
<BR>
<P><P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Michael LaTorra
