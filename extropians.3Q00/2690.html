</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I found the references to permaculture to be nicely vague and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full of feel good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; warm and fuzzy meaningless new age words. If you have a link to one that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually has something to say, please let me know...
</EM><BR>
<P><P>You're right, most of them are pretty bad, although I thought the Tagari
<BR>
Farm site was better than most, and I know from talking to people that the
<BR>
farm itself is very well done.  If there were more thinking like the thought
<BR>
which created that farm, humans could be a keystone species rather than the
<BR>
problem species they often are.
<BR>
<P>In real life, many of the people who say they're doing permaculture farms
<BR>
are not; and they often do very silly things.  For example, some people I
<BR>
knew near Austin bought 1000's of young fruit trees and planted them only a
<BR>
foot or so apart.
<BR>
<P>Of the accredited universities I know of which offer permaculture-type
<BR>
programs, the University of California at Davis has the best.  The last time
<BR>
I was in Davis I stopped by a very nice permaculture garden some of the
<BR>
students were growing on campus.  In the City of Davis (not associated with
<BR>
the University), there's a subdivision called Village Homes that's designed
<BR>
using permaculture principles.  I think you'll find these sites pretty much
<BR>
free of new age fuzziness.
