<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         September 25, 2000
<BR>
<P>ENTANGLED PHOTONS COULD PROMISE LIGHTNING-SPEED COMPUTERS
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defying traditional laws of physics, researchers may have 
<BR>
found a way to blast through imminent roadblocks on the highway 
<BR>
to faster and smaller computers.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using modern quantum physics, a research team from NASA's 
<BR>
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif., and the 
<BR>
University of Wales in the United Kingdom has discovered that 
<BR>
entangled pairs of light particles, called photons, can act as a 
<BR>
single unit, but perform with twice the efficiency. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a process called &quot;entanglement,&quot; the research team 
<BR>
proposes that existing sources of laser light could be used to 
<BR>
produce smaller and faster computer chips than current technology 
<BR>
allows. Their paper appears in today's issue of the journal 
<BR>
Physical Review Letters.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our economy constantly depends on faster and faster 
<BR>
computers,&quot; said JPL researcher Dr. Jonathan Dowling, a co-author 
<BR>
of the paper. &quot;This research potentially could enable us to 
<BR>
continue upgrading computers even after traditional manufacturing 
<BR>
procedures have been exhausted.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, in a process known as optical lithography, 
<BR>
manufacturers use a stream of light particles to sculpt computer 
<BR>
chips. A chip is basically a grid of interconnected on-off 
<BR>
switches, called transistors, through which electric current 
<BR>
flows and enables computers to calculate. As companies crowd 
<BR>
millions of transistors into tinier chips, electric current 
<BR>
travels shorter distances, resulting in speedier processes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chipmakers shine a laser light onto photosensitive material 
<BR>
to create a stencil-like mask, which is used to carve silicon 
<BR>
into the components of transistors. However, the producers can 
<BR>
only provide transistors with dimensions as small as those of the 
<BR>
masks.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's state-of-the-art chips have transistors measuring 
<BR>
between 180 and 220 nanometers, approximately 400 times narrower 
<BR>
than the width of a human hair. While traditional computers have 
<BR>
the ability to perform with transistors as small as 25 
<BR>
nanometers, or 3,000 times narrower than a human hair, this 
<BR>
presents manufacturing obstacles.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light manufacturers use to produce today's transistors 
<BR>
has a wavelength of 248 nanometers. It becomes increasingly 
<BR>
difficult to use light with shorter wavelengths to produce 
<BR>
transistors with smaller dimensions. In fact, according to a 
<BR>
central principle of optics called the &quot;Rayleigh criterion,&quot; 248-
<BR>
nanometer light can't create features smaller than 124 
<BR>
nanometers.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this new research, still in its theoretical stage, 
<BR>
could provide a bypass of the Rayleigh criterion. The research 
<BR>
team proposes that entanglement would allow the use of existing 
<BR>
sources of laser light of 248 nanometers to produce computer 
<BR>
chips with dimensions of a fourth of the wavelength (62 
<BR>
nanometers) or smaller compared to today's limits (124 
<BR>
nanometers).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entanglement would allow researchers to use the intermingled 
<BR>
properties of two or more photons to obtain subwavelength spatial 
<BR>
resolutions. Albert Einstein called this intermingling of photons 
<BR>
process &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; because the particles can 
<BR>
immediately influence each other over huge distances, even 
<BR>
halfway across the galaxy. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here on Earth, entangled photons can be produced by passing 
<BR>
a light beam through a special crystal. In this quantum 
<BR>
lithography proposal, a pair of entangled photons enters a setup 
<BR>
with two paths. While the two particles travel together and act 
<BR>
as a single unit, it is impossible to determine which of the two 
<BR>
paths the pair has taken. In a strange effect of quantum 
<BR>
mechanics, however, each photon actually travels down both paths.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On each path, the photons act like a rippling wave with 
<BR>
peaks and valleys. After traveling on their own path for a while, 
<BR>
the two photons converge on a surface. Because the light 
<BR>
particles making up each wave were originally entangled, the 
<BR>
result of adding the photon waves together is to create patterns 
<BR>
on the surface equivalent to those made by a single photon with 
<BR>
half the wavelength.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process, in essence, enables the entangled photon pair 
<BR>
to produce patterns twice as small on each side of a chip's 
<BR>
surface as can be created by the single photons in the 
<BR>
conventional optical lithography procedures. Entangling more than 
<BR>
two photons would improve results even further.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a number of technical challenges remain, researchers 
<BR>
are already working on developing materials that would be 
<BR>
required for quantum lithography.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This research is part of the Revolutionary Computing 
<BR>
Technology project in the NASA/JPL Center for Integrated Space 
<BR>
Microsystems.  The project is supported by the Deep Space Systems 
<BR>
Program in NASA's Office of Space Science. JPL is managed for 
<BR>
NASA by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
