Another not well understood natural phenomenon that contributes to the chaos
<BR>
and confusion of reported UFOs.
<BR>
<P>----------------
<BR>
After rummaging through books, magazines, clippings, etc. I've found a few 
<BR>
more ball lightning references. These vary from the academic to the
<BR>
anecdotal.

<BR>
1. pp. 273-274: In *Nature*, 37-187, and *L'Astronomie*, 1887-76, we are
<BR>
told that an object, described as &quot;a large ball of fire,&quot; was seen to rise from
<BR>
the sea, near Cape Race. We are told that it rose to a height of fifty feet, and
<BR>
then advanced close to the ship, then moving away, remaining visible about
<BR>
five minutes. The supposition in *Nature* is that it was &quot;ball lightning,&quot; but 
<BR>
Flammarion, *Thunder and Lightning*, p. 68, says that it was enormous.
<BR>
Details in the American *Meteorological Journal*, 6-443--Nov. 12, 1887--British
<BR>
steamer *Siberian*--that the object had moved &quot;against the wind&quot; before
<BR>
retreating--that Captain Moore said that at about the same place he had seen
<BR>
such appearances before. *Report of the British Association*, 1861-30: That,
<BR>
upon June 18, 1845, according to the *Malta Times*, from the brig *Victoria*,
<BR>
about 900 miles east of Adalia, Asia Minor (36 degrees, 40 minutes, 56 seconds,
<BR>
N. Lat.: 13
<BR>
degrees, 44 minutes, 36 seconds E. Long.), three luminous bodies were seen to
<BR>
issue from the sea, at about half a mile from the vessel. They were visible
<BR>
about ten minutes.
<BR>
2. &quot;As to what ball lightning is, we have not yet begun to make intelligent 
<BR>
guesses.&quot; (*Monthly Weather Review*, 34-17.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, it seems to me that when we encounter the opposition [to]
<BR>
&quot;ball lightning&quot; we should pay little attention, but confine ourselves to
<BR>
guesses 
<BR>
that are at least intelligent, that stand phantom-like in our way. We note
<BR>
here that in some of our acceptances upon intelligence we should more clearly
<BR>
have pointed out that they were upon the intelligent as opposed to the
<BR>
instinctive. 
<BR>
In the *Monthly Weather Review*, 33-409, there is an account of &quot;ball 
<BR>
lightning&quot; that struck a tree. It made a dent such as a falling object would
<BR>
make. Some other time I shall collect instances of &quot;ball lightning,&quot; to
<BR>
express that they are instances of objects that have fallen from the sky,
<BR>
luminously, exploding terrifically. So bewildered is the old orthodoxy by these
<BR>
phenomena that many scientists have either denied &quot;ball lightning&quot; or have
<BR>
considered it very doubtful. I refer to Dr. Sestier's list of one hundred and
<BR>
fifty instances, which he considered authentic.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote from the introductory paragraph of item [5]1.:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Readers of Dr. Menzel's latest book, *The World of Flying Saucers* will
<BR>
recall that the author attempted to explain one mystery (UFOs) in terms of
<BR>
another
<BR>
(fireballs). It would seem that the latter subject has attracted as little
<BR>
scientific attention as the former. Indeed, if one takes a close look at the
<BR>
history of fireballs one is almost persuaded that their behaviour resembles
<BR>
that of the Foo Fighters of the 1939-1945 war. Even Dr. Menzel had to admit
<BR>
that scientists knew very little about fireballs, though he was prepared to
<BR>
invoke them as conventionalisations for flying saucers. The saucer student
<BR>
could equally well reverse the process and claim that what was known as a
<BR>
fireball in the past was in fact the flying saucer of today.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 21 references in [3] above are the more academic while all else is
<BR>
anecdotal. While not exhaustive these references are some of the more
<BR>
unknown to most students of ball lightning. I'm sure other references exist in
<BR>
the
<BR>
specialty (a.k.a. fringe science) magazines; however, little to no indexing
<BR>
makes it difficult to find ball lightning &quot;stuff&quot; when mixed in with
<BR>
luminous, atmospheric, meteorological, and UFO phenomena. That will be the focus
<BR>
of my next search.

<EM>&gt; Strangely enough I have heard some theories re this type of UFO and the
