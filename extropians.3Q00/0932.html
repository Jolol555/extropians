This is good news, now not only is FM-2030 in the excellent hands
<BR>
of the folks at Alcor, but apparently he was suspended using the
<BR>
recent breakthrough in protocol. Very good news indeed.

<P><P>WHY BE PART OF THE LAST GENERATION TO DIE BEFORE ANTI-AGING
<BR>
MEDICINE SOLVES THE AGING PROBLEM?
<BR>
<P><P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<BR>
<P>Scottsdale, AZ, 11 July 2000.    Futurist, lecturer and writer
<BR>
FM-2030 was placed into cryostasis on July 10, 2000 at the Alcor
<BR>
Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona.   
<BR>
<P>FM-2030 was a strong advocate (for three decades) of using
<BR>
cryostasis as a possible means for saving the lives of individuals
<BR>
who cannot be saved by current medical technology.   His books
<BR>
include The Upwingers, Optimum One, Telespheres, and Are You
<BR>
Transhuman?.   He taught futurist classes over the
<BR>
years at such locations as UCLA and the Smithsonian Institution,
<BR>
and he wrote articles for major news papers like the New York Times
<BR>
and the Los Angeles Times.
<BR>
<P>New surgical techniques being pioneered at Alcor were used for the
<BR>
first time in the cryoprotection operation for FM-2030.  These
<BR>
resulted in vastly improved cryoprotection for this long-time
<BR>
supporter of the cryostasis process as a potentially life saving,
<BR>
though still experimental, technique.
<BR>
<P>The Alcor Life Extension Foundation was founded in 1972 as a
<BR>
non-profit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, and has 39 patients
<BR>
in cryostasis.  Alcor is the world's largest provider of
<BR>
professional cryotransport services with over 500 members who have
<BR>
pre-arranged for cryotransport.  Alcor's Emergency CryoTransport
<BR>
System (ECS) is a medical-style rescue network patterned after
<BR>
Emergency Medical System (EMS).  Alcor CryoTransport Technicians,
<BR>
as with EMS technicians, are remotely advised by on-call physicians
<BR>
who are Alcor members and/or contract physicians.  
<BR>
<P>If an individual is successfully placed into cryostasis, there are
<BR>
patient funds for long term care.  These funds are maintained in an
<BR>
independent Patient Care Trust and are invested such that they have
<BR>
traditionally earned at least double the current costs of keeping
<BR>
patients in cryostasis, providing extra safety margin against poor
<BR>
investment years.
<BR>
<P>Can patients in cryostasis be successfully resuscitated, perhaps
<BR>
decades from now, when new medical breakthroughs can reverse the
<BR>
damage caused by diseases not currently curable?   The medical and
<BR>
scientific foundations for this are discussed at length in a new
<BR>
book: Nanomedicine, Volume I, by Robert Freitas. These
<BR>
revolutionary concepts were presented by Ralph Merkle, PhD at the
<BR>
Fourth Alcor Conference on Life Extension Technologies held in June
<BR>
2000.
