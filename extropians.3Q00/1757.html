<P><EM>&gt; I read a review of MS Space Simulator saying that it was very realistic; too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  realistic to be playable in the reviewer's opinion, although he did concede
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that hardened space-heads would lap it the punishment. You guys seen this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  game?
</EM><BR>
<P>It was one of the last &quot;games&quot; I spent a LOT of time with and was, without a 
<BR>
doubt, the best over-all space simulator I ever encountered.  It had some odd 
<BR>
characteristics that indicated that developing it had not been a high 
<BR>
priority in MS.  It was a DOS-based game and was never happy in Windows.  In 
<BR>
fact, I tried to run it in Win98 and it was a no-starter (probably good for 
<BR>
me).  Even when it was new the graphics component wasn't that good -- not up 
<BR>
to then-current state of the art.
<BR>
<P>The basic ballistics algorithms were great, though, and I had a lot of fun 
<BR>
tweaking orbits.  I can recall spending a frighteningly large amount of time 
<BR>
playing at lowering the perfectly circular orbit of a spacecraft around Luna 
<BR>
to the absolute LOWEST possible altitude.  Unfortunately, the graphics engine 
<BR>
wasn't great, so you didn't get the images of craters and mountains zipping 
<BR>
past that would have been nice.  Also, the aerodynamics simulation when you 
<BR>
were in the Earth's atmosphere was piss-poor, especially considering the 
<BR>
state of MS's Flight Sim in those days.  Something that seems like it would 
<BR>
have been a natural to do would have been to marry the two with a good 
<BR>
interface, so you could shift back and forth between the two with the same 
<BR>
vehicles.  No such luck: MS let Space Simulator die, with no upgrades.
<BR>
<P>Finally, there was no good ballistics analysis tool to help generate 
<BR>
rendezvous calculations -- you had to &quot;cheat&quot; or spend unreasonable amounts 
<BR>
of fuel guestimating to do a rendezvous.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that the market for a REALLY accurate space simulator must be 
<BR>
small, or someone would have done it . . .
