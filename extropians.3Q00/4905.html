<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You think so? In the past century, the fact that the average

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; european was 20
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times more likely to die from government weapons than an American

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was likely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; die from any violent crime whatsoever,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike, is this including World Wars? :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Harvey, wars are caused by governments, so anyone who died as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; result, died as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a result of government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No disagreement from me Mike.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was just clarifying the source of your statistics.  I thought it was a non
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sequiter to argue about Janet Reno by quoting statistics of European war
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; casualties.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just trying to follow the conversation, that's all.
</EM><BR>
<P>Clarification helps. Here's some more: Most of those that died during the two
<BR>
world wars were not enemy soldiers or enemy civilians. They were typically
<BR>
citizens who were victimized by their own governments. Whether it was the
<BR>
Ottoman extermination of Armenians, those that died from land mines after the
<BR>
war, who were arrested by their own countrymen and put into concentration camps
<BR>
(most Jews sent to concentration camps that were not germans were typically
<BR>
arrested by quislings of their own nationality), or killed outright for
<BR>
resistance activities, or as a result of collateral damage from falling
<BR>
shrapnel, or starvation or disease, these were all the actions of their own
<BR>
governments.
<BR>
<P>As far as I am concerned, Janet Reno is no better than Goering, Quisling, or
<BR>
anyone else who was 'just following orders' when innocent civilians died as a
<BR>
result of the intentional acts of of government troops against those civilians.
<BR>
The only thing to quibble about is degree. While Joe Dees repeatedly brings up
<BR>
McVeigh (who was not a capitalist, or a business owner, or a corporate
<BR>
executive, by any means), the fact is that Reno still has more blood on her
<BR>
hands than McVeigh has, and she has yet to be charged with a crime, although
<BR>
there is a class action mandamus lawsuit against her regarding her illegal
<BR>
administration of the NICS system. It continues to be appealed, and will remain
<BR>
so until she is out of office, when the suit will have to be refiled against the
<BR>
new attorney general (unless, of course, Gore gets elected and keeps her on
<BR>
board).
<BR>
<P>Don't think my numbers are accurate? How about this: based on the fact that we
<BR>
know that liberalized concealed weapons laws lower violent crime by 8%, and that
<BR>
there are some 8,000 or so people murdered each year (this does not count
<BR>
suicides, self defense, or other non-murder homicides), then her collusion in
<BR>
restrictive gun control legislation and enforcement costs 640 lives every year.
<BR>
In the eight years she has been in office, she has the blood of 5120 people on
<BR>
her hands due to her gun control politics.
