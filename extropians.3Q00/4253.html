<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd lean toward the name &quot;teleoperative&quot;, which connotes a professional,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rather than a mindless slave. There'd need to be a code of ethics,
</EM><BR>
similar
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to that of interpreters, of impartially handling interaction for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; teleoperator, of confidentiality, all that stuff. For some tasks, you
</EM><BR>
might
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get right down to the job of directing the teleoperator; maybe through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heads-up displayed arrow, which tells them which way to turn their head,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; maybe the buzzing mentioned below, whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps.. I think you might end up with different classes here- kinda
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the difference between an executive personal assistant and a temp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who only works for you for one day or a week. An executive in a company
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might have a dedicated teleoperative they could send out on things that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were confidential. But for other things you might go with a cheaper temp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if that's all you needed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely.
<BR>
<P>I must clarify something; I see the main advantage of the teleoperation as
<BR>
the ability to be present, remotely. So for instance, I cant see a big
<BR>
demand for hiring someone in the same city to go do things. The idea is that
<BR>
you might hire someone in another state, another country, on the other side
<BR>
of the world.
<BR>
<P>I've got two major assumptions underpinning this. The first is that the
<BR>
world economy is &quot;globalising&quot; further; trade barriers are coming down,
<BR>
people are ever more receptive to the idea of international trade.
<BR>
Globalised service provision in all sorts of areas, where geography is not a
<BR>
limiting factor, is on the rise.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, and locked with the first assumption in a chicken/egg
<BR>
relationship, is the fact that the global communications infrastructure to
<BR>
make this work is also on the rise. Bandwidth, ah bandwidth, just keeps on
<BR>
increasing. It's one of those measurable, continuous quantitative changes
<BR>
which brings about qualititative changes as the numbers pass particular
<BR>
thresholds. Like, for instance, as realtime video becomes affordable over
<BR>
wireless comms, new things become possible.
<BR>
<P>So, people will be wanting to interact with other people who are far, in
<BR>
increasingly complex and sophisticated ways. They will pay money to do it.
<BR>
So far, knowledge work is increasingly easy to deliver at a distance, even
<BR>
when it requires quite interactive communication. Thus the rise of
<BR>
teleworking (including pure teleworking involving great geographical
<BR>
divides).
<BR>
<P>I see that people will want to do more than communicate remotely; they will
<BR>
want to interact remotely. Teleoperation will come into existence.
<BR>
<P>urg, I've drifted. I agree with your point Brian, except to say the
<BR>
dedicated executive assistant teleoperative is likely to be a
<BR>
low-functionality alternative; if the teleoperative is local to you, they
<BR>
still have to do all the travel that the executive would have to. Still a
<BR>
boon, but lacks the immediate response of using someone who is already near
<BR>
the desired location.
<BR>
<P>I would predict that multinationals would have staff teleoperatives (or use
<BR>
outsourcing alternatives) at all important locations. If you are in country
<BR>
X, and need to go see someone in country Y, you book time with one of the
<BR>
local teleoperatives (a bit like grabbing a fleet car), and get things done
<BR>
immediately.
<BR>
<P>I totally agree that you would have a gammut of skill/price alternatives,
<BR>
from the equivalent of a low level admin person, up to highly skilled
<BR>
teleoperative professionals. It would depend on budget, and the task
<BR>
required. The industry would likely become fairly complex!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm interested in the state of wireless comms in the US, mainly. What's
</EM><BR>
an
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; affordable data rate (say using cellular networks), and what are the
</EM><BR>
charges
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like? How about if money was no object; what kind of bandwidth could we
</EM><BR>
put
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; between a teleoperator on one side of the world, and a teleoperative on
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Depends on location- inside an office building or campus you can get
</EM><BR>
10mbit
<BR>
<EM>&gt; wireless. This would have to be provided by the company or location the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teleoperative is visiting. If they are out wandering around a location
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without that capability you have to fall back to either cellular, CDPD, or
</EM><BR>
at
<BR>
<EM>&gt; most the 128kbit packet service of Metricom in a few cities. Don't expect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usable video streaming for probably another 3 years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a bit a trend, is it not, where buildings are wired up for high
<BR>
bandwidth wireless internally? So people have one phone, which works on the
<BR>
internal network when inside, and uses a telco's mobile service when
<BR>
outside.
<BR>
<P>This would have great promise. After all, most things &quot;businessy&quot; happen
<BR>
inside buildings.
<BR>
<P>Wireless comms seem to be incredibly hot stuff at the moment. I expect the
<BR>
bandwidth situation will be looking much more promising in the very near
<BR>
future. I think for a while the data rates will increase, but
<BR>
incompatibilities between different networks and equipment will also
<BR>
increase; there will be a shitfight on. It's not such a problem for a
<BR>
teleworking business, actually. The focus would be on a per-city basis; for
<BR>
any general location, there'd be some feasible approach to work with local
<BR>
infrastructure, even if it's a bit hacked together; especially if it's a bit
<BR>
hacked together. The harder it is to do, the better the viability for those
<BR>
who can achieve it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However if the teleoperative stored the video onto tape, they could send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the high quality video to you to look over later when they get back to
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt; HQ.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's falls within my &quot;low control factor&quot; model. If I were going to set up
<BR>
a business around this concept, it would start by providing low control
<BR>
factor, and try to do some medium factor work, most likely within limited
<BR>
criteria (for specific types of work, within confined geographical location,
<BR>
for large dollars, etc). I would try to be on top of where wireless was
<BR>
heading, and have the business models ready to roll as new milestones were
<BR>
reached; as the competition starts to crop up at a particular level of
<BR>
service, I am already beginning on the next level. I would predict that
<BR>
people mostly would regard teleoperation now as implausible; that's an edge
<BR>
for me. I also predict that as low control-factor is mastered, people would
<BR>
not regard medium control-factors (a diverse space) as plausible; I still
<BR>
have an edge. Finally, I think people will not believe high-control-factors
<BR>
are plausible, even as medium factors are mastered. Still got an edge. After
<BR>
that? Cash out, let other people fill in the blanks, and maybe it will be
<BR>
time to start getting involved in AI research, or coding for whatever level
<BR>
of nanotech is happening by then.
