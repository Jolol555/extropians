Excerpt from US NEWS and WORLD REPORT: 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/000828/trials.htm">http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/000828/trials.htm</A>
<BR>
<P><P>The backbone of American medical research is broken. The 41,000 clinical 
<BR>
trials now testing new treatments for humanity's plagues have been intensely 
<BR>
scrutinized, after tragic mishaps last fall spurred concerns about patients' 
<BR>
safety and researchers' reliability. The conclusions are devastating. Within 
<BR>
the past week, a variety of critics have declared that trials are rife with 
<BR>
conflicts of interest, that the analysis of women is inadequate, and that 
<BR>
study results can be all but useless because so many patients lie when they 
<BR>
claim to have followed instructions...
<BR>
<P>[I have suspected as much for years. Have can I not, what with the unending 
<BR>
stream of seemingly contradictory studies that flood the media.
<BR>
Surprising to see this story finally break, considering all the money at 
<BR>
stake.]
<BR>
<P>...But over the long haul, to truly make human trials safer, more accurate, 
<BR>
and faster, most experts agree that biotechnology that minimizes the use of 
<BR>
humans as guinea pigs is the ideal solution.
<BR>
<P>[Now you're talking. How about cooking up some psuedo-humanoid brainless 
<BR>
guinea pigs? ]
<BR>
<P><P>Already, new software makes it possible to simulate entire trials and answer 
<BR>
many questions about a new therapy, without ever risking the health of a 
<BR>
single person. But whether it's software or something not yet envisioned, 
<BR>
it's clear that the current system has outlived its usefulness and is beyond 
<BR>
repair.
