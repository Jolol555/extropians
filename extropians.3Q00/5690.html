<EM>&gt; The comment was made that no capitalist ever forced people into a

<EM>&gt; Perhaps not. They just exploited the labor of the slaves the concentration

<EM>&gt; camp owners made available to them. And supported the rise and Reichs of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concentration camp creators. And gave money to paramilitary organizations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that abducted and killed organizers that opposed the concentration camps.

<P>James, you could not be more wrong. I suggest you read Albert Speer's _Inside
<BR>
the Third Reich_. Hitler refused to follow Speer and Todt's advice to follow the
<BR>
lead of the allies in recruiting the female population to work to free 1 million
<BR>
men up for the army. Instead, he ordered Speer and Todt to follow the
<BR>
recommendations of Bormann and other SS toadies to obtain loborers from the 250
<BR>
million residents of occupied countries under their control, by force if
<BR>
necessary, and when they ran out of free laborers, they used concentration camp
<BR>
prisoners. Speer and the industrialists accepted this in the face of facing
<BR>
charges of defeatism. Any facilities that used prisoner or slave laborers, the
<BR>
SS guards were in charge of the welfare of the prisoners, and Speer frequently
<BR>
drew the ire of the SS when he demanded improvements of the living and working
<BR>
conditions of the prisoners, which was the main reason why he drew the lightest
<BR>
sentence of all of the top echelon of the Reich at the Nuremburg trials.
<BR>
<P>Speer documents how Goering and Bormann would extort kickbacks from
<BR>
industrialists to the detriment of the war effort, requisitioning industrial
<BR>
equipment and funds for their own use, and taking state lands for their own game
<BR>
preserves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Capitalism has no ethics, and has no necessary relationship to liberal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democracy. Capitalists will exploit repression as easily democracy. Under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some circumstances capitalists have backed dictators, and under other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances &quot;democrats.&quot; All they care about is their ability to generate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and keep profit. Thats fine in its place, i.e. a strong liberal and social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democracy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if you are too blind to understand the significant differences between
<BR>
mercantilism, oligopolism, and capitalism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It appears from the debate on this list that there are a growing number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanists hip to the fact that the defense of liberal democracy, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all members of the list benefit from, requires more than obeisance to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fantasy model of anarcho-capitalism. If we are to avoid profound social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conflict in the coming decades there must be a vision of transhuman liberal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and social democracy, one that can allow and protect the co-existence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans 1.0 and post-humans. The hegemony of anacho-capitalism in transhuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circles just makes more likely that the coming changes will exacerbate gaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between rich and poor, and generate conflicts between the forces of reaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and those of progress.
</EM><BR>
<P>What we are 'hip' to is that socialists will continuously try to re-invent
<BR>
themselves, repaint their horse, change their names, invent new catch phrases,
<BR>
and deny that the con they are selling today has anything to do with the con
<BR>
they were shoving down people's throats yesterday at gun point. What we are
<BR>
'hip' to is that anarcho-capitalist free markets are quite as capable of
<BR>
maximizing freedom for the most people possible as any other system, and far
<BR>
better than most, including socialism. A social democracy is not a liberal
<BR>
democracy, no matter how much you try to insist it is so. One decrys the
<BR>
individual, the other celebrates it.
