<P>
As you all probably noticed already, I'm back in New Hampshire after a week and
<BR>
a half estevation to the wilds of Jackson, Montana for the 2000 Rainbow Family
<BR>
Gathering. I road tripped with two people out and three other people back. Julie
<BR>
Masis (one of Sasha's ex-girlfreinds), I and a guy from the Bronx we found on
<BR>
the ride share website drove out. The guy from the bronx (Eric), I, and a guy
<BR>
from Boston and a rapper from Laconia, NH drove back with me, while Julie
<BR>
continued on to visit a friend in British Columbia. Coming back we drove from
<BR>
Butte, Montana to New York City in 48 hours, despite playing tag team with a
<BR>
hail/thunderstorm system all the way back. BTW: We drove my jeep cherokee (the
<BR>
crappy one with all the previous problems) the whole way out and back, with nary
<BR>
a problem, burning only a quart of oil in 5600 miles.
<BR>
<P>I left here Thurdsday, the 29th in the morning, picked up Julie in Durham, then
<BR>
Eric at his brother's in Danbury, Connecticutt in the afternoon. We took a lazy
<BR>
two and a half days to get to Jackson, driving I-84 and I-90. Julie is not that
<BR>
strong a driver, so our pace was dictated by how quickly Eric and I became
<BR>
exhausted, restricting us to 16-18 hour driving days.
<BR>
<P>We stopped in Dillon, MT for supplies, then went on to Jackson, a one street
<BR>
town with a general store, a bar/grill, and a hot springs lodge (which is quite
<BR>
nice after a week in the woods), and a post office. We parked in front of the
<BR>
post office, and an old cowboy in a pickup parked behind us as Eric sent off his
<BR>
tax return before we hit the bush. I chatted with the old cowboy about local
<BR>
conditions while watching a circus of beaded and tie dyed neo-hippies traipse
<BR>
around between the store and the bar, waiting for the payphone and picking up
<BR>
supplies. The old guy had an twangy singsong voice. He asked me what I was up
<BR>
to, I said that I came into town to do some fishing and camping. He said,&quot;Oh, we
<BR>
got some great fishing round here, you wanna fish the Big Hole River between
<BR>
here and Wisdom. Great trout.&quot; I said I was going up Skinner's Meadow Road to
<BR>
fish up in the hills. He said,&quot;You done wanna go up there, thets where all them
<BR>
wierdo's are campin' at.&quot; I said I was camping with the wierdos. He said,&quot;They
<BR>
done fished everthing out up there.&quot; I said I wasn't sure, cause most of them
<BR>
are vegetarians anyways, which he laughed at. I asked what the bears were like
<BR>
in the area, if they were as much trouble as at Yellowstone, he said no, they
<BR>
stay away from people 'roun these parts'. Rattlesnakes didn't come around
<BR>
either, as we were at too high an altitude for them at 7500 feet. He
<BR>
continued,&quot;We did have a problem with them black wolves a while back cause them
<BR>
fish and wilelife idjuts brought 'em in, but they got shot one night, so we got
<BR>
no more problem.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The day we went in, the population of wierdo's was pushing eleven thousand (to
<BR>
peak at between 22k and 25k by July 4th), on Saturday the 1st. The Rainbow
<BR>
Family Gathering is an interesting conglomeration of people. At the entrance is
<BR>
what is called 'A' Camp, which is where the alcohol drinkers camp at, and who do
<BR>
the indroductory welcome speil to arriving vehicles, and generally try to
<BR>
panhandle some beer or other booze off of you (so you have less to get drunk
<BR>
with inside, if you bring any at all). Then you go up the road to 'Welcome Home'
<BR>
where other people inform you of whats where and where to park at and so forth,
<BR>
though they try to steer anyone who doesn't look like a regular Rainbow person
<BR>
to park in 'Upper 'A' Camp'. At this site, the layout of the Gathering was
<BR>
kindof like a bush or shrub, where it was situated in a many fingered alpine
<BR>
valley, with 'Welcom Home' located at the stump, and the access road continuing
<BR>
on around up the left hand spurr of the valley, up around to the head of the
<BR>
valley, and around the other side. All in all, about three or four square miles,
<BR>
I'd say. The center of the valley is a large sage field, with sage slopes on
<BR>
either side, and grassy stream glens spreading out up the valley, with forests
<BR>
of lodgepole pines in between the glens.
<BR>
<P>In the center of the sage field is the Main Circle, where the 'Heartfire' is
<BR>
kept lit, and a non-stop drum circle is maintained, which reaches quite a party
<BR>
pitch in the late evenings. A little up the valley is the 'Trading Circle',
<BR>
where people trade everything from incense, crystals and jewelry, to camping
<BR>
supplies, candy (anything candy-like is called &quot;zoo-zoo's&quot; in Rainbow parlance,
<BR>
and being generous with your zoo-zoo's can make you a popular person), to any
<BR>
sort of drugs or drug paraphernalia, with the exception of alcohol. Alcohol is
<BR>
frowned upon at the gathering by many people, and A Camp is relied upon to
<BR>
filter much of it out. I heard one story about last years gathering where a guy
<BR>
was packing in a case of beer when he got clubbed and knocked out, to awake to
<BR>
find out the A Campers had taken exactly HALF his beer...
<BR>
<P>There are these people who are dedicated Rainbow-ites that are basically
<BR>
political correctness police, but which everyone calls the 'high holies',
<BR>
because they are so big muckity muck about people doing things the 'Rainbow
<BR>
Way', but most people generally ignore them when out of sight if they choose to.
<BR>
Its a nice sort of spontaneous anarchy that goes on, with the only real
<BR>
organization or leadership that happens is by individual initiative or by
<BR>
someone who is whats called a 'focalizer' basically announcing that something
<BR>
needs doing by so many people, and people generally just volunteer to help out.
<BR>
<P>The only real hard and fast rules that everyone is militant about are sanitation
<BR>
rules, using the trenches everyone calls 'shitters' properly, and handling food
<BR>
properly. Having so many people in a wild area without modern facilities is
<BR>
obviously a risk to health if not managed properly, but I didn't hear of anyone
<BR>
contracting anything, even though the local water did test positive for e. coli
<BR>
(all water used by people is either boiled, filtered or treated with bleach or
<BR>
other chemicals, or both).
<BR>
<P>While most Rainbow folks are vegetarians, the local Montana Rainbow Family do
<BR>
have a militant meat eating contingent, and run a decent free range meat
<BR>
kitchen, which brings us to the subject of kitchens, which are one of the few
<BR>
real points of organization at the Gathering, besides the clinic, central supply
<BR>
(which handles and distributes all donated supplies), and the info center. There
<BR>
are Kitchens and there are Cafes. A kitchen basically cooks large quantities of
<BR>
food several times a day, and offers tea and/or coffee on a near 24 hour basis.
<BR>
They have a dedicated core group of 6 or more people who organize and supply the
<BR>
whole kitchen with its food prep equipment, tarps and other camping stuff, and
<BR>
generally move into the site two weeks before July 4th to construct their
<BR>
'kitchen', including a shitter, a compost pit, water supply and water treatment
<BR>
stations, rock and mud firepits and grills/ovens/stoves, and food preparation
<BR>
and serving areas. The normal bulding technique is to collect fallen wood and
<BR>
fashion structures, counters and shelves out of the wood with twine, a la Swiss
<BR>
Family Robinson. Nails are not used, and any wood cut with a blade must be
<BR>
burned by the end of the Gathering. Trails are all delineated with other fallen
<BR>
wood, and people are encouraged to only use the trails to minimize the impact
<BR>
upon the rest of the environment. Cafes are smaller, more occasional setups.
<BR>
Eric, the guy from the Bronx who rode with us on the way out, had a two burner
<BR>
white gas stove with pots and pans, and a lantern, while Julie had an 8'x12'
<BR>
tarp, and I had my camping espresso machine, a shovel and a 5 gallon bucket, so
<BR>
we formed our own Cafe, called the 'Hot and Wet, Sometimes Warm and Dry Cafe',
<BR>
or &quot;Hot + Wet&quot; for short. We only made large dinners a few nights, ususally just
<BR>
serving coffee or espresso to the ocassional person or to our camping neighbors
<BR>
who would come over to hang around our campfire at night to stay warm (you could
<BR>
only have a fire if you had a shovel and a 5 gallon bucket of water, and it
<BR>
tended to get quite cold at night in those mountains).
<BR>
<P>While there are typically one or two leaders in a Kitchen or Cafe, they must
<BR>
rule by a motivational/volunteer/consensus method to get any cooperation and
<BR>
assistance running things. There were quite a number of Kitchens, from Kiddie
<BR>
Village (where most Rainbows with kids camped) to FERN, BARF, ARF, Love'n Ovens
<BR>
(which built these huge ovens out of rock and mud and baked bread and other
<BR>
goodies all week, while performing at least one marriage a day), Aloha (which
<BR>
had some great 'authentic' hula dancers), Teepee Village (mostly Montanans),
<BR>
Granola Funk Express (which built this awesome stage and put on comedy/fold/hip
<BR>
hop shows, and has spawned the hip hop group Granola Funk), Ohana, Jerusalem
<BR>
(the Kosher Kitchen), Montana Mud, Musical Vegetarians, Serenitea, Tea Time,
<BR>
Brew-Ha-Ha, Sprout Garden, Kickdown Cafe, Beansteam, Hari Krishna Camp, Dancers
<BR>
for Peace, etc. All told, there were 146 Kitchens and Cafes. The kitchen I hung
<BR>
out at the most when not operating Hot &amp; Wet or not hiking around to other
<BR>
kitchens or partying at the Main Circle (or fishing), was called Milliways, the
<BR>
Restaurant at the End of the Universe. It was located near the head of the
<BR>
valley, about a hundred yards beyond our Cafe, and was one of the cooler
<BR>
kitchens. A younger bunch, more inclined to party, but who ran a great kitchen.
<BR>
They banned tea from the kitchen in responose to the ban of coffee by the tea
<BR>
cafes and militant vegan kitchens, and while many Rainbows are militant about
<BR>
recycling everything possible, the motto around Milliways is 'fug it, burn it'. 
<BR>
<P>I didn't get a chance to inquire if there was any philosophical reason for the
<BR>
use of the name Milliways, such as any extropic or omega point philosophy going
<BR>
on, as they usually had gotten me quite smoked out by the time the idea occured.
<BR>
I had become quite a hero of Milliways one day by going into Dillon and packing
<BR>
in two gallons of neapolitan ice cream (with ice), and promptly donating it to
<BR>
the kitchen for their after dinner enjoyment, so consequently, I never had any
<BR>
trouble finding herb after that... ;) One of the Milliways crew lives in Mass
<BR>
and comes up to Hanover to visit his girlfreind, so I'll ask then if there is
<BR>
any connection.
<BR>
<P>THere was also a Libertarian Party camp at the gathering.
<BR>
<P>While there was definitely a contingent of permanently blissed out hippies, or
<BR>
those stuck in the groove of all that meaningless flowery new age rhetoric, I
<BR>
found most of the people to be very typical people. I struck up a few
<BR>
conversations around campfires, injecting extropic memes in to mitigate the
<BR>
negativist 'fuck the government, fuck free enterprise, fuck technology, fuck the
<BR>
human race, etc' sentiments some people had, and was able to conduct some
<BR>
significantly deep conversations with people, much like we have here on the
<BR>
list. I even made a few business contacts, one of which said,&quot;Don't let the tie
<BR>
dye , beads, and dreadlocks fool you, some people here are phenomenally rich.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Frankly, I think the Rainbow Gatherings would be a great place to propagate
<BR>
Extropic memes. While boom boxes and such are banned, there is widespread use of
<BR>
'appropriate technology'. I counted a number of solar panels in use along with
<BR>
laptop computers, while the areas where buses and RVs camped, called the (lower,
<BR>
middle, and upper) Bus Village were veritable hot spots of high tech use. People
<BR>
loved my camp espresso machine. The Gathering is a veritable stew pot to mix
<BR>
memes in, and send them out into the world, but only the radical
<BR>
environmentalists/vegans and Krishnas actually try to take advantage of it
<BR>
(though there is a growing Jesus Camp, and as I said, there was  Libertarian
<BR>
Camp there).
<BR>
<P>The morning of the 4th was the big peace ceremony, where most everyone went down
<BR>
to the Sage field and formed a pair of Om circles, the inner one 300 yards wide,
<BR>
and the outer one over a mile in diameter, across the entire valley. After the
<BR>
prayer for peace, there was a drumming and dancing party like I've never seen.
<BR>
Widespread nudity, acid trippers, and everyone eating watermelon to stay
<BR>
hydrated. A couple I had made some espresso for a few days prior when we were
<BR>
setting up our cafe smoked me out and gave me some shrooms, so I sat back,
<BR>
tripped, and got a significant sunburn while I observed the goings on and
<BR>
thought deep thoughts...I know that I had some great ideas and breakthrough
<BR>
concepts that afternoon, but I JUST CAN&quot;T REMEMBER!!! ;)
<BR>
<P>The evening of the 6th and morning of the 7th we worked to 'dissapear' our cafe,
<BR>
and helped Milliways do the same with their huge ovens. Everyone tries to
<BR>
eliminate as much evidence of human habitation as possible when they leave.
<BR>
<P>The ride back on the 7th was stressful and interesting. We were on a tight
<BR>
schedule, as I and Justin, the rapper, both had to work today. The guy from
<BR>
Boston, a retired nuke missile/sub engineer turned hindu/buddhist
<BR>
nomenclaturbationist who is active in the New England Rainbow Family (NERF,
<BR>
which ran the FERN Kitchen) had trouble with his ATM card, as his bank was just
<BR>
bought out by Fleet and consequently his PIN was changed while he was away.
<BR>
Eric, the New Yorker, was sure he was just scamming a ride and that we should
<BR>
dump him. I talked to his bank and verified that there was in fact a problem, so
<BR>
we carried him all the way, and he sent me off a check today, according to the
<BR>
call he made to my office. It will be nice to send Eric a check for his part of
<BR>
the bill to show that not everyone is a New York con artist.
<BR>
<P>Oh, and BTW, I caught some great trout...
