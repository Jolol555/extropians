<EM>&gt; Does anyone else here think is unfair and unjust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a woman can always get out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsibility for a child (before birth by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aborting it and after birth by putting it up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adoption), while a man can literally be held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsible for hundreds of thousands in expenses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just because he was careless enough not to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rubber, or because a woman's birth control method
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did not work or because he was lied to? (&quot;Yes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honey, I'm on the pill.&quot;) Fair is fair. If women
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legally don't have to support their kids, men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shouldn't have to either. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm gay, but if I were a heterosexual man the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prospect of having sex with any woman would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatly concern me for these reasons.
</EM><BR>
<P>See William Farrell's book, &quot;The Myth of Male Power&quot;
<BR>
for a discussion of this and other alleged inequities.
<BR>
&nbsp;Following is part of the Amazon.com review:
<BR>
<P>--------------
<BR>
<P>&quot;Through numerous short-take paragraphs,
<BR>
Farrell--armed with hundreds of thoroughly documented
<BR>
statistics and legal citings--argues that men are
<BR>
oppressed by several ``glass cellars,'' among them war
<BR>
(in which it's mainly men who die); suicide (``A
<BR>
husband whose wife dies is about ten times more likely
<BR>
to commit suicide than a wife whose husband dies'');
<BR>
and ``the death professions'' (``The Jobs Related
<BR>
Almanac...found that twenty-four of the twenty-five
<BR>
worst jobs were almost-all-male jobs''). He emphasizes
<BR>
that women live, on average, seven years longer than
<BR>
men, and that men's health issues, unlike women's, are
<BR>
basically ignored. He contends that women's net worth
<BR>
exceeds men's, and that economic power, if measured by
<BR>
spending rather than by earning, belongs primarily to
<BR>
women (``Both sexes buy more for women''). Farrell
<BR>
accuses government of becoming a ``substitute
<BR>
husband'' through welfare and through discriminating
<BR>
in favor of women in cases of murder, sexual
<BR>
harassment, and rape;&quot;
<BR>
<P>-------------------------
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, this book usually precipitates more
<BR>
dissension than dialogue.
