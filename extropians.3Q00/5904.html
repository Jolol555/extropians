<EM>&gt; I prefer to use standard economic theory for understanding future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; societies, including politics.  [...] [W]hen things change a lot, trends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't continue and informal categories break down, and only the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abstract and general theory remains a reliable guide.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Standard economic theory and Paretian policy analysis is very general and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can speak to the future scenarios of interest to us.  It often, but far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from always, supports the sort of policy conclusions that libertarians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come to.  When they disagree, I tend to go with economic theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>By itself economic theory cannot deliver a policy, as it is value neutral.
<BR>
I'm not sure exactly what you mean by Paretian policy analysis, but it
<BR>
must be from this that prescriptions come.  I'm going to guess about
<BR>
the meaning of this term.
<BR>
<P>An economy lacks Pareto optimality if some people can be made better
<BR>
off without anyone being made worse.  This is a plausible candidate for
<BR>
providing policy guidance, but I suspect that it is weak in practice.
<BR>
Given the complexities of the world it will be hard to tweak a system
<BR>
to make everyone better (or no worse) off.
<BR>
<P>My experience is that modern liberal-socialist governments go far beyond
<BR>
this.  The underlying philosophy seems to be a desire to see greater
<BR>
equality.  That's why we have graduated income tax, social security,
<BR>
medicare, minimum wage laws, etc.  I would suggest that a substantial
<BR>
portion of government activities today do not flow from a simple Pareto
<BR>
optimality criterion.  Virtually every government activity makes some
<BR>
people worse off.  It would be an interesting challenge to point to
<BR>
an exception.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I have misunderstood the scope and power of Paretian analysis,
<BR>
though.
