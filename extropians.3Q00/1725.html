<EM>&gt; No, not arbitrarily. You've already admitted that defense is much more expensive than

<EM>&gt; offence so just building more defense is simply not going to work unless your resources

<EM>&gt; are infinite. They're not.

<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;if I just buy some paint at Home Depot and paint my warhead white you'll have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;increase the power of your LASER about a hundred times.

<EM>&gt;     &gt;Awww, c'mon John, humor me just a little.  Do you really believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;those who dream up these systems have not anticipated this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure that somebody involved in the project had taken Physics in High School so the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea must have been tossed around. However they concluded, quite correctly, that it had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing to do with the main function of the system, to provide employment for themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and their friends. I mean, if the system is ever actually needed nobody expects to be held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accountable afterward when it fails to work as promised.

<P>Well, there is the issue of the troika, there are bunkered ICBMs, submarines, and bombers.
<BR>
Destabilizing that are the issues of more volatile powers developing nuclear capabilities such
<BR>
as the recent countries expressing their statement by violating the environment with nuclear
<BR>
blast tests, e.g., Mururoa.  Most dangerous in almost any scenario is that while MAD (Mutually
<BR>
Assured Destruction) generally proves that nuclear armed states will not launch them at each
<BR>
other, there are many delivery methods and some chance each year that functional weapons of
<BR>
largescale mass destruction would be acquired or manufactured by rogue parties.
<BR>
<P>In terms of futuristic defense mechanisms, having something in orbit already gives it a lot of
<BR>
momentum when it hits the ground.  &quot;Brilliant Pebbles&quot; and ground based lasers are of note,
<BR>
and ground-to-air rockets should be developed in the long run as a tool to push away rogue
<BR>
would-be meteors.
<BR>
<P>In terms of ICBMs, one thing that would be very cost-effective against them would be, if they
<BR>
were launched en masse, would be to launch a much higher speed vector of some kind of massive
<BR>
EMP pule to disable their guidance, although they are presumed to be hardened.  If sufficient
<BR>
targeting exists, then the &quot;Brilliant Pebbles&quot; scenario is perhaps most effective, as they
<BR>
could wap ICBMs on their way up, falling from orbit where they are already established.
<BR>
<P>Moscow is supposed to have an anti-missile system, I don't know if it is ever tested.
<BR>
Matthias Rust flew right into Red Square, no?  This was known to the rest of the world, and
<BR>
wasn't really a big deal.
<BR>
<P>My advice:  drive friendly.
<BR>
<P>About the lasers I think you can adjust the frequency to make them non-visible or something,
<BR>
ablative and reflective materials would still be effective laser retardant.  How about a
<BR>
magnetic tube focussing a plasma burst from a tokamak, except it would diffuse when it got
<BR>
past the containment.
<BR>
<P>Anyways, curtail your statist state today.  Have a nice day.
