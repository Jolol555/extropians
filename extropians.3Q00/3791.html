<EM>&gt; &gt; Folks who are inclined to mystical explanations of reality tend to take

<EM>&gt; &gt; anything that is not yet explained--or not explained fully or with great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; confidence--by the methods of science, and attribute its features to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mystical agencies, and to claim that it cannot now, cannot ever be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; explained by science, and that therefore science is--hurray!! we

<EM>&gt; &gt; win--inferior to faith and mysticism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Bullshit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If you knew people who were mystically inclined, you would know better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please quit projecting your personal biases onto others.

<EM>&gt;  I'm mystically inclined and have no problems with scientific explanations for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomena. It does not effect the subjectivity of experiences or the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are phenomena which we cannot be readily explained because they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occurred outside of the lab. The late Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan was a proponent of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meditation within the Jewish religious tradition and of Kabbalah. He was well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respected. He was also a nuclear physicist and was well respected there as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well. Your explanation does people a disservice with its simple minded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking and dislike of people different than yourself.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know a lot of mystically inclined people, and the overwhelming majority are
<BR>
know-nothing zipperheads, and happy to stay that way. They find thinking
<BR>
rationally, logically, to be too tiring for their poor little minds. They
<BR>
prefer, as a famous wrestler has said, 'the crutch of religion.' Religion and
<BR>
mysticism ARE the opiates of society, just as much as opiates are the religion
<BR>
of society.
<BR>
<P>While studying mystical things can be interesting, and good study for someone
<BR>
interested in stretching their mind, actually beleiving any of that nonsense is
<BR>
the realm of simpletons.
