<P>I'd be interested in a cite for that.

<P>I disagree with this section of this article:
<BR>
<P>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
The five properties that follow characterize psychotherapy as it is done in
<BR>
the field. Each of these properties are absent from an efficacy study done
<BR>
under controlled conditions. If these properties are important to patients'
<BR>
getting better, efficacy studies will underestimate or even miss altogether
<BR>
the value of psychotherapy done in the field.
<BR>
<P>1.Psychotherapy (like other health treatments) in the field is not of fixed
<BR>
duration. It usually keeps going until the patient is markedly improved or
<BR>
until he or she quits. In contrast, the intervention in efficacy studies
<BR>
stops after a limited number of sessions—usually about 12—regardless of how
<BR>
well or how poorly the patient is doing.
<BR>
<P>2.Psychotherapy (again, like other health treatments) in the field is
<BR>
self-correcting. If one technique is not working, another technique—or even
<BR>
another modality—is usually tried. In contrast, the intervention in efficacy
<BR>
studies is confined to a small number of techniques, all within one modality
<BR>
and manualized to be delivered in a fixed order.
<BR>
<P>3.Patients in psychotherapy in the field often get there by active shopping,
<BR>
entering a kind of treatment they actively sought with a therapist they
<BR>
screened and chose. This is especially true of patients who work with
<BR>
independent practitioners, and somewhat less so of patients who go to
<BR>
outpatient clinics or have managed care. In contrast, patients enter
<BR>
efficacy studies by the passive process of random assignment to treatment
<BR>
and acquiescence with who and what happens to be offered in the study
<BR>
(Howard, Orlinsky, &amp; Lueger, 1994).
<BR>
<P>4.Patients in psychotherapy in the field usually have multiple problems, and
<BR>
psychotherapy is geared to relieving parallel and interacting difficulties.
<BR>
Patients in efficacy studies are selected to have but one diagnosis (except
<BR>
when two conditions are highly comorbid) by a long set of exclusion and
<BR>
inclusion criteria.
<BR>
<P>5.Psychotherapy in the field is almost always concerned with improvement in
<BR>
the general functioning of patients, as well as amelioration of a disorder
<BR>
and relief of specific, presenting symptoms. Efficacy studies usually focus
<BR>
only on specific symptom reduction and whether the disorder ends.
<BR>
<P>It is hard to imagine how one could ever do a scientifically compelling
<BR>
efficacy study of a treatment which had variable duration and
<BR>
self-correcting improvisations and was aimed at improved quality of life as
<BR>
well as symptom relief, with patients who were not randomly assigned and had
<BR>
multiple problems. ...
<BR>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>For &lt;~$100M one could do a study like the RAND health insurance experiment.
<BR>
Take a few thousand families, randomly assign half to free therapy and half
<BR>
to full price therapy for five years.  At the end look at thirty different
<BR>
general mental health measures.
<BR>
<P>Or course $100M is a lot of money.  And odds are you'd see the same thing
<BR>
they saw in the RAND HIE study - basically no effect.
