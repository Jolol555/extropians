<P><EM>&gt;  The body functions were measured after each picture was viewed.  Do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  you know which group of men found their significant other to be more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  attractive?!!!  So much for &quot;love&quot;.  Or are extropian men &quot;different&quot;?  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  hope so!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, I doubt it. Read on...
<BR>
<P>Did they mention women, were they measured too? I bet the same 
<BR>
model/porny-pics turn them on more than ones of their computer programmer 
<BR>
sweethearts. Personally I find images of unknown women much more erotic than 
<BR>
pictures of normal guys ( or girls). I am not sure a candid photo of my guy 
<BR>
would arouse me as much a a good airbrushed penthouse pic - (depending on the 
<BR>
pic) - and I am not a lesbian. 
<BR>
<P>Bottom line, we've been sold a bill of goods. When I think of &quot;sexy&quot; images, 
<BR>
I think of Playboy and Madison Avenue models. I paint that kind of thing too 
<BR>
when I want erotic art, not some guy with it all hangin' out!
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think *that* arousal reaction is a pre-programmed reaction due to too 
<BR>
much exposure to advertising selling women's bodies as sex. 
<BR>
<P>Until recently with Calvin Klien and GAP I rarely saw men on display except 
<BR>
in homo-erotic ways. and those guys are AWFULLY lean, pretty and young.. not 
<BR>
anyone i'd spend an evening discussing architecture and art with.. if ya know 
<BR>
what I mean...If men's bodies were sold as sex items we would have a larger 
<BR>
acceptance of men's bodies and privates, and also men could be viewed as sex 
<BR>
objects without being gay. Perhaps even men would get turned on by other men 
<BR>
and lose some of their homophobic fear of seeing other men naked! ( ...ah, I 
<BR>
can hear the groans of dismay)
<BR>
<P>If you mean are extropian men more discriminating in who they chose to have 
<BR>
relationships with - then yes, I would say so - in general. They want 
<BR>
conversationss that matter. But they are no more in charge of what gets them 
<BR>
aroused than the rest of us. 
<BR>
<P>Seems to me a healthy libido is a good thing, but it lets us get manipulated 
<BR>
all too easily.
