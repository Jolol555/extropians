</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ross's idea is sound, where people have legally purchased copies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of their music downloaded to their system. If they want to make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;available to all (and make some money off of late return fees),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they need to use an app that not only uploads the single copy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the music to the library server, but maintains some sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;'overlord' log of all activity using that music file on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;persons system, so they could not upload it to the library if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;there is a record of them retaining a copy on a backup tape, CDR,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;floppy, etc. The app would allow them to 'check out' music files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that are properly licensed, and the library server can only allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as many downloads as it has legal licenses for. Users that don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;return the files they downloaded on time pay late fees, which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;split between the library server company and whoever purchased the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;original file and made it available to the public on the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(which could be the server company, a music listener, or even the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;artist or his recording company). In this case, an artist or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;recording company could presumably make 1000 licenses available to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the server library, and make money off of late fees. Users that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;incur late fees are given the option by email to either return the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;music, pay the late fees to hold onto the music for x amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;time, or buy the music license outright.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;THIS could potentially be a money making dot com idea, although I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;am concerned about news that Napster has distributed its server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;source code over the net and others are now setting up their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;servers elsewhere to run independent of Napster and US Courts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is all related to some ideas I had several years ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everybody was entranced with the idea of video-on-demand, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought they had overlooked a much easier and possibly more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; profitable idea, music-on-demand.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a buddy right now who is interested in backing initial development of
<BR>
such a project to the tune of about $50,000.00. Anyone interested in doing
<BR>
development work on this???
