<P>
I wanted to chime in here, because my experiences have driven me to a state
<BR>
of similar fascination.
<BR>
<P>First, I am a 100% proponent of the idea of modular intelligence.  
<BR>
My family seems to display high variance along a spectrum of strengths and
<BR>
weaknesses, in which I observe loose patterns that could suggest, at least
<BR>
partly, some genetic contribution.  I haven't discovered any robust methods
<BR>
thus far to further characterize them, or to separate nature from nurture,
<BR>
in the interest of an experiment.  
<BR>
<P>Introspection, in various mental states (I'll get back to this later), leads
<BR>
me to conclude that I am a 'visual' learner to a high degree, relative to
<BR>
the accounts of the strategies of others.  I have proceeded through a few
<BR>
advanced mathematics courses, without too much difficulty (other than,
<BR>
perhaps, a situational lack of discipline to practice the methodology), and
<BR>
I would like to share the following observation:  I found mathematics,
<BR>
especially multidimensional calculus, incredibly difficult, until learned to
<BR>
adapt visualization strategies to the learning process.  Looking at the
<BR>
equations on paper engaged weaker parts of my brain - it was only after I
<BR>
imagined the functions in a 3d space in front of me, and set the image in
<BR>
motion if called for, that I achieved what I would call true understanding
<BR>
of the techniques.  I found myself drawing pictures almost everywhere in my
<BR>
studies - mathematics, physics, and biosciences.  My professors, on many
<BR>
occasions, asked to meet with me about this habit.   Sometimes, there were
<BR>
problems due to a failure to communicate the meanings of my symbolism (I
<BR>
imagined this was most severe when my professors weren't themselves visual
<BR>
learners), other times my professors loved this, found it efficient, and
<BR>
encouraged it.   When it came to mathematics, I saw this as a gift, UNTIL I
<BR>
started dealing with systems with more than four dimensions (x,y,z,t).  ;)
<BR>
My difficulty visualizing four dimensional space (or fractional dimensional
<BR>
space) forced me to suffer the far-more-difficult symbolic mode(s) of
<BR>
learning.  It was incredibly frustrating.  How does one exercise the ability
<BR>
to visualize dimensional spaces outside our normal realm of experience?
<BR>
<P>I know exactly what you mean by synesthesia.  I know enough to conclude that
<BR>
in normal modes of consciousness, I observe no significant blurring of the
<BR>
lines between sensory modalities.  But, I will report to you in earnest that
<BR>
I have induced these experiences, in replicated experiments, with
<BR>
psychoactive chemicals.   My first experiences were with LSD.  I noticed
<BR>
this to a greater degree with psilocibin.  I later discovered these
<BR>
experiences were not constrained to hallucinogens, when I discovered
<BR>
ketamine, which produced the most profound synesthetic experiences I have
<BR>
had.  Usually, I scribbled my experiences madly on a notepad.  Mostly, I saw
<BR>
colors and felt textures in music and other auditory experience.  Patterns
<BR>
of motion and pressure across my skin induced similar visual experiences.  I
<BR>
don't remember any accounts of 'tasting' images, sounds, or tactile events.
<BR>
Hearing sounds in coincidence with other sensory modalities falls into a
<BR>
special category, because I found it difficult to differentiate synesthesia
<BR>
from auditory hallucination by other external causes.  These events, though
<BR>
difficult if not impossible for me to re-experience from memory in (more)
<BR>
normal modes of thought, I can confirm through the honest scribblings in my
<BR>
notebooks.  The vocabulary I used to describe events, both internal and
<BR>
external, are strongly suggestive of it.  Dare I say more?  One last thing.
<BR>
About my writing.  I have gone back to read what was written under the
<BR>
influence of chemicals thus conducive, in normal consciousness, and thought
<BR>
on some occasions: 'I was insane.  This is madness - it makes no sense.'
<BR>
Then, on a later date, appropriately 'modified,' I could go back, read over
<BR>
the thoughts as written, and experience nearly total recall, and total
<BR>
understanding of how and what I was thinking, where I left off...  This is
<BR>
strongly suggestive of modes of thought, different patterns of
<BR>
'mind-modules'  activated, that can be revisited reliably by ingesting the
<BR>
same substance at a later time.  I am intensely curious about the nature of
<BR>
synesthetic experiences as reported by others.  I hypothesize that some
<BR>
modalities are more strongly correlated than others, with respect to the
<BR>
coincidence of perception.  I believe this data has the potential to
<BR>
elucidate some interesting facts about how the brain associates and stores
<BR>
these sorts of experiences.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Ryan

Subject:	human/world interfaces
<BR>
<P><P>In going through the list archives I came upon a thread which began as a
<BR>
discussion of &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; and evolved through mathematical
<BR>
ability and on to the ability to form visual images from memory.  Later,
<BR>
after I'd subscribed to the list, I rambled on about my weird way of
<BR>
interfacing with the world and some people commented on my apparent
<BR>
synethesia (eg. I see leaves swirling from a tree in the fall, and the sight
<BR>
of the leaves falling is translated in my mind into music and often touch as
<BR>
well, as though I'm feeling the swirl of the leaves against my skin).  At
<BR>
the time, I hadn't read the earlier thread, so I didn't know if other people
<BR>
would be interested in this sort of stuff; so I didn't say anything more at
<BR>
the time.  Now that I know there's an interest, I'd like to open the
<BR>
discussion up again.
<BR>
<P>My original reason for being interested in the human/world interface is
<BR>
self-curiosity.  I realized from an early age that my mind didn't work like
<BR>
other people's, and that as a result it was hard for me to communicate with
<BR>
them, and I've often felt lonely. When I was a kid I thought I'd been put on
<BR>
the wrong planet by mistake, and when I heard stories of UFO's, I hoped one
<BR>
would come and get me and take me to my proper home.
<BR>
<P>Later, I expanded my selfish motivations to include the possibility of
<BR>
improving my communications skills.  If I could figure out how most people
<BR>
interfaced with the world, I'd be able to imagine how it felt to be them,
<BR>
and then I'd stand a better chance of saying the right things to them.  I
<BR>
don't mean right as in politically correct but rather, right as in &quot;not
<BR>
crazy.&quot;  (people used to say of me that I was off in my own little
<BR>
god-knows-where world)(my brother once suggested that I might be a
<BR>
&quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic, but I don't think I quite fit that category
<BR>
either)
<BR>
<P>I can see now that there are other uses for this interface question, such as
<BR>
in the development of AI.
<BR>
<P>I will continue with this idea in another message, because otherwise this
<BR>
one is going to end up being too long.
<BR>
<P>Here is a summary of the previous thread (the posts are severely clipped,
<BR>
but they're available in their entirety in the archives):

<P>I have a very uneven distribution of mental talents. I've always scored off
<BR>
the scale (on the good side :-) in visualization and verbal skills, but am
<BR>
basically a mathematical moron.

<P>I've been informally polling people about their visual imagery.
<BR>
<P>Most can form some kind of red triangle in imagination, and rotate it to the
<BR>
left, then to the right, and go on to make a picture of their dear old
<BR>
Maman, check the color of her eyes, and so on. Some are exceptionally good
<BR>
at this stunt, making elaborate flowcharts and tracking through them without
<BR>
moving a muscle (or maybe they twitch in sympathy). Others can
<BR>
`see' whole movies as they read a novel.
<BR>
<P><P>Me, I've got *zero* visual imagery.
<BR>
<P>The module's not there, apparently.
<BR>
<P><P>[the following from message sent to extropian list by altamira 6/17/00]
<BR>
<P>for example, looking at clouds and seeing hundreds of different shades of
<BR>
white and at the same time hearing (in one's mind) all these shades of white
<BR>
translated into corresponding frequencies of sound; or listening to the
<BR>
rumbling of a machine and suddenly hearing intensely beautiful music in the
<BR>
combination of sounds and seeing (in the mind) the sounds translated into
<BR>
something like graphs of mathematical functions, weaving in and out of each
<BR>
other.
