<EM>&gt; If anyone out there has input into game development, PLEASE try to make

<EM>&gt; I used to be, a certain turn-off to me was and is the Star Wars and Star Trek
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; style of &quot;whoooshing&quot; airplane-like space flight depicted in most space-based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or space-connected games.

<P>That is the one great thing about Asteroids: it gets zero-g maneuvering right,
<BR>
at least for a vehicle with intermittent thrust. A constant thrust vehicle will
<BR>
in fact behave more like an airplane, though not to the degree that most video
<BR>
games presume. I have the collection of great old arcade games (Asteroids, Tank
<BR>
Commander, Space Invaders, Pong, Tail Gunner, etc.) on my home PC and enjoy
<BR>
blasting away for no cost what I once spent untold amounts of quarters to play. 
<BR>
I also remember programming into my dad's Texas Instruments calculator the lunar
<BR>
lander program around age 7 or 8, running my own lunar descent in my cardboard
<BR>
box LEM with the TI 'instrument panel' displaying my rate of descent and
<BR>
altitude in response to my thrust inputs. The walkie talkie communication with
<BR>
'Houston' (mom baking in the kitchen) completed the illusion, though I was
<BR>
positive that Houston never told Neil Armstrong to come in and wash his hands
<BR>
and face if he wanted a peanut butter and fluff sandwich...
