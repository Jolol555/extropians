You can use the term &quot;friendly&quot; in connection with the behavior of
<BR>
humans and dogs and many other creatures that we understand, but it has
<BR>
no meaning when applied to behavior that we have no hope of
<BR>
understanding.  I am always amused when SF writers attempt to describe
<BR>
the motives and behaviors of the SI.  As if!!
<BR>
<P>An SI may decide that it is &quot;friendly&quot; to suddenly halt all humans in
<BR>
mid thought.  No humans would see this as &quot;bad&quot; because no one would
<BR>
experience it at all (I think I hear a tree falling in the woods
<BR>
somewhere).  Now you might say that it was &quot;bad&quot; anyway because the SI
<BR>
would have known that if we knew what it was going to do we would not
<BR>
have liked it.  But, what if the SI actually halted all of us because it
<BR>
decided to make a very &quot;friendly&quot; world for us, but knew that the
<BR>
planned manipulation of the matter of the galaxy would take several
<BR>
billion years, and wanted to spare us the subjective wait for paradise
<BR>
by encoding us now for playback later.  What if we cannot make an SI in
<BR>
the first place, because at some point in development they always go
<BR>
into some kind of introspective state and halt themselves?  These &quot;what
<BR>
ifs&quot; are nonfalsifiable, and pointless.
<BR>
<P>We cannot know what an SI will do, if we could, it would not be one.  It
<BR>
all comes down to this basic childhood wisdom:
<BR>
<P>&quot;It takes one to know one.&quot;
