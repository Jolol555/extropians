<P>
Greetings Extropians.
<BR>
<P>About 8 months or so ago, David Gobel &amp; I formed a new company called
<BR>
Vastmind, as a result of discussions on this list and on Eliezer's
<BR>
Singularitatians list.
<BR>
<P>It is our pleasure to debut the early beta version of Vastmind to
<BR>
the members of the extropians list.
<BR>
<P>What is Vastmind? It is a general purpose distributed computing
<BR>
service. With our system, people will be able to sell or donate spare
<BR>
computing resources to those that need it for large projects. If you are
<BR>
unfamiliar with the concept read Egan's &quot;Permutation City&quot; which discusses
<BR>
the potential of a planetary computing market.
<BR>
<P>You may well be aware that in the past several months, numerous
<BR>
other start-ups have appeared that compete directly with us. We are 
<BR>
hoping that extropians will choose to assist us in establishing a 
<BR>
foothold in the emerging market.
<BR>
<P>If we succeed, it will benefit the extropian agenda.
<BR>
For instance, when the day comes where Singularity Institute is in 
<BR>
need of some serious computional power, we want to be there to 
<BR>
provide it. When Anders needs to train thousands of neural networks, 
<BR>
or render his next beautiful povray scene, we hope to be there to 
<BR>
help. When Eugene needs to needs a terraflop or two to breed a robust 
<BR>
genetic programming algorithm, we hope to be there to provide that 
<BR>
power.
<BR>
<P>How can you help? We need two things -- applications and *lots* of computers.
<BR>
<P>To become a vastmind node (a machine that donates/sells its spare resources)
<BR>
one needs only to run our node software on your computer. It lives in the
<BR>
background and when the machine is not in use, it works on any projects that
<BR>
vastmind has available. Currently, only linux &amp; freeBSD node software is
<BR>
available. Windows &amp; Macintosh node software will be available in the near
<BR>
future. We are looking for tech-saavy volunteers with fast internet connections
<BR>
(no modems please! dsl, cable, or better) to help increase our node-count.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.vastmind.org/">http://www.vastmind.org/</A>
<BR>
<P>If you are a developer who is interested in writing a distributed application
<BR>
our development kit is now online. Vastmind has been engineered to be 
<BR>
both responsive for small jobs (such as a ray-tracing job that will 
<BR>
only take a few minutes) and for mega-scale projects that might take 
<BR>
months or years (such as SETI@home, cracking encryption, and so on). 
<BR>
It also features a data caching system which will eventually be 
<BR>
extended into a more proper intelligent distributed file system.
<BR>
<P>In the coming weeks, Vastmind will be used for some interesting AI projects
<BR>
to do with the board games &quot;Lines of Action&quot; and &quot;Hex&quot;. A strong opening
<BR>
book will be built for Lines of Action, and an attempt to solve 7x7 hex
<BR>
may be attempted (6x6 hex has been solved, but 7x7 has been too
<BR>
computationally expensive with only a handful of machines). These are
<BR>
projects from the University of Alberta GAMES research group:

<BR>
<P>We are also looking to fill a contract position for porting the node software
<BR>
to Windows. Contact &lt;<A HREF="mailto:davidson@cs.ualberta.ca?Subject=Re:%20Vastmind:%20Distributed%20Computing&In-Reply-To=&lt;f04320403b5967e6c2fe2@[24.108.7.68]&gt;">davidson@cs.ualberta.ca</A>&gt; if interested.
