<EM>&gt; The destruction of GE crops is on the rise in North America. In the past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; six months there have been numerous assaults on GE crops in Maine,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Vermont, Minnesota, California and British Columbia. This is a perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example of a case where the enemy is weaker than one might think. Test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crops are easy to destroy, anyone can cut down a crop, yet the destruction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of test crops costs seed companies considerable time.

<P>I smell a business plan in here.  It is very hard to make money in farming (I
<BR>
have watched my eldest sister try to do so for 40 years).  However, I suspect
<BR>
someone could make a bundle by providing secure farm facilities to the GMO
<BR>
research companies.  That way they can subcontracting out this problem.  The
<BR>
grower could charge them 100x what it would cost to grow the crops on ordinary
<BR>
farms, but they would be glad to pay it to be out of this loop, and have their
<BR>
investment secure.
<BR>
<P>As I indicated in an earlier post, this would be ripe for abuse.  I suspect
<BR>
that in the name of security, the grower would not reveal the farm locations
<BR>
to the researchers, but just show some kind of meeting specifications.  This
<BR>
means someone who almost, but not quite, understands the possible interactions
<BR>
puts the farm in a place &quot;safe&quot; from the neoluddites, but not safe from the
<BR>
kind of environmental dangers that only the brightest of the researchers can
<BR>
understand.  The GMO company would claim that they were not accountable for
<BR>
where the subcontractor put the farm.
<BR>
<P>I do not think it is a good thing, but if subcontract high security GMO
<BR>
growers were on the Idea Futures, I would buy some.
