<EM>&gt; &gt;It seems to me that about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;half the physically fit adult men in the country are capable of doing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;under the right circumstances.  Bare handed adult males are dangerous - when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                                                   ^^^^^^^

<EM>&gt; &gt;they want to be or when they lose their heads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't forget the other gender. Women may be generally smaller and less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; massive, but they can succeed at an effective self-defense or offense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too (bare handed). Their effectiveness would be due to education,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skill and training.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example, one piece of information that would be valuable for every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human for their own self-defense is knowledge of the vulnerable places on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the human body. And then learn how to use that information. It's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard physically to hurt someone else (esp. in their vulnerable places).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In my opinion, the hard part of that action is actually in one's mind-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is, giving oneself permission to badly hurt someone else. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must work through the mental exercise that if someone takes physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action against you, then that person has lost all rights, and it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; morally OK to take action against them. That exercise must be worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through far in advance of any real-life threatening situation, so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if, or when, it happens in one's life, then you can act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *instinctively*, without thinking (the mind would then just get in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Not many of us are Bruce Lee caliber martial artists or capable of
<BR>
becoming anywhere close to one.  For most of us a male agressor in his
<BR>
early twenties in reasonable shape is very much capable of overpowering
<BR>
us and of closing the distance between himself and us all too quickly. 
<BR>
As much as I hate to say it, if worry about such agression is warranted
<BR>
in your life, I don't think anything can beat the &quot;stopping power&quot; of a
<BR>
personal firearm.  Pepper spray just isn't all that effective in as many
<BR>
situations.  If he his close enough for you to kick or gouge then he is
<BR>
close enough for one swing that connects to knock you for a loop or do
<BR>
real damage.  Frankly I have had enough friends raped, mugged and even
<BR>
had a second level friend beaten to death. Like most of us I tend not to
<BR>
dwell on these things too much.  But I can't help but wonder if one
<BR>
friend would still be alive and if the others would have been a lot less
<BR>
traumatized if they were armed.  The issues aren't all academic or a
<BR>
matter of 2nd amendment justifying of not justifying it.  These things
<BR>
are also a matter of life and death of real people, some of them quite
<BR>
close to me.
