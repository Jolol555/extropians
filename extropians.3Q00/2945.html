<EM>&gt; &gt; I like it!  Although I admit that the hard sell propaganda sounds a wee bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scary.  My &quot;guardian,&quot; my &quot;protector?&quot;  It will bring good things to me?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Did these guys ever read _Brave New World_ or _1984_?  -Zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They didnt say how much it costs.  If reasonable, Ill take one.  Recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some time ago I bought up the notion of a group of volunteers who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are willing to have *every* aspect of their lives open to scrutiny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by anyone.  Heres one application: testing the new human ID implants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another is voice recognition and verification for purchases.  Ill do it!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pick meeeeeeee!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Zero, you and I were among those who were advocating a more transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society.  This latest little girl who was kidnapped Thursday and was recovered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yesterday could be the poster child for open society.  How about it, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parents?  Would you be in favor of ID implants for your kids?  spike

Put it in kids, prisoners, convicts, and dangerous dogs, and whoever is dumb enough to beleive that the corps and govs want you to have it for your own good. Not me, thanks.

<P>Evangelical Christians will consider this an early harbinger of the rule of the Antichrist which they believe is coming.  I will be interested to see to what extent they protest this technology.  
<BR>
<P>I also wonder how fast it well be till tyrannical gov'ts institute this technology by force to closely monitor dissidents?  How much will the world protest this?
