<EM>&gt; What could be more Extropian than Carrier Command?
</EM><BR>
<P>I remember that game fondly.  I wish they'd do a remake of it; it'd
<BR>
probably sell well even compared to the games out there today!
<BR>
(Especially if one could add in network capability, to allow multiple
<BR>
players and carriers, as many humans per side as desired.)  The few
<BR>
games I've seen try to remake this concept have tended to fail badly;
<BR>
this is the only good &quot;you are in multiple places at the same time and
<BR>
none of them are on pause&quot; simulator I've ever seen.  (And you know
<BR>
you're not dealing with Yet Another [fill_in_the_blank] when the
<BR>
documentation starts with:
<BR>
&quot;The following information is of a highly confidential and sensitive
<BR>
nature and must not fall into the hands of dangerous and irresponsible
<BR>
persons.  I am, of course, speaking of politicians and journalists.&quot;)
<BR>
<P>For those of us who haven't played it, I highly reccomend it if you're
<BR>
looking for a time killer.  Fortunately, there is a PC version available
<BR>
(or so I'm told), and given the game's age, its makers are unlikely to
<BR>
care about piracy.
