<P>&lt;&lt; Spudboy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems, after listening to you for awhile, that you are using a 
<BR>
&nbsp;somewhat unusual definition of capitalism.  Can you point to any of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;classical capitalist that agree with your definition?  In fact would you 
<BR>
mind 
<BR>
&nbsp;making an attempt to define capitalist as you use it.The people you point to 
<BR>
&nbsp;seem to be a combination of witch doctors and thugs but not capitalist at 
<BR>
&nbsp;all.  
<BR>
&nbsp;Ron H. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Ron, all I am doing is basically giving you the common descreiption-however 
<BR>
flawed of how captialism is usually described. When Adam Smith was stalking 
<BR>
the earth, I doubt he would have had trouble identifying slavery as being a 
<BR>
&quot;capitalist&quot; process. That is the exchange of money for goods and services, 
<BR>
products and commodities. In the case of slavery, it certainly was a 
<BR>
business, and a pathologically evil business, but a business never the less. 
<BR>
Capitalism by definition is the exchange, sale, barter, or payment of goods 
<BR>
and services, via privately-held property , in order to provide 
<BR>
&quot;capitalisation&quot; of these business processes. (pant pant) In the Soviet Union 
<BR>
you can rightly declaim the mass-murders, as you can in Cambodia and the 
<BR>
Peoples Republic of China, as the responsibility of the scoialist leadership 
<BR>
and their many followers. Similarly, the vicissitudes enacted bt the 3rd 
<BR>
Reich, or The Confederacy of America, were surely business practices--however 
<BR>
vile they may be.
