<P><EM>&gt;Who do you have in mind as &quot;the best of the business theorists&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I tend to think of business models as well within standard economics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So in those terms Krugman might be faulted for not knowing enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about a certain area of economics.  My guess though is that these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;business theorists you like are far from having established their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new business models to most economist's satisfaction.
</EM><BR>
<P>No doubt. How are you going to test these views, when the economy is 
<BR>
changing rapidly? Certainly economists should be *trying* to test business 
<BR>
theorist's ideas, but it's not going to be easy.
<BR>
<P>Here's one business theorists who I think highly of. I like all I've read 
<BR>
by him (which is not everything he's written), but I'll especially 
<BR>
recommend his new book:
<BR>
<P>Geoffrey Moore, Living on the Fault Line: Managing for Shareholder Value in 
<BR>
the Age of the Internet.
<BR>
<P>There's also a large volume of research on better ways of valuing 
<BR>
intangible assets, such as the work of Bernard Lev at N.Y. University. You 
<BR>
can find links to much of this material by checking under the New Economy 
<BR>
topic at www.manyworlds.com.
<BR>
<P>Onward!
