<BR>
world of scarcity where even mere surival actually is pretty problematic.  
<BR>
The trouble is we haven't thought past genetic conditioning that is largely 
<BR>
outmoded.   - samantha &gt;&gt;

<P>Samantha,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you imagine the greed, jealousy and short sightedness present in 
<BR>
people that don't want to see others have anything?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was raised in a poor segment of society.  Early on I was let hnow that 
<BR>
my ticket out was in &quot;hitting the books.&quot;  When I was in college I was 
<BR>
ridiculed gently by my friends for not going to work and &quot;making some money.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;Early in my career, the &quot;sphagetti years,&quot; those same friends offered to 
<BR>
help me get a &quot;good job.&quot;  Then when things came my way they said, &quot;I never 
<BR>
had it lucky like you.&quot;  Now that we are all retired they want the &quot;govament&quot; 
<BR>
to give them more.  They never connect the dots and realise the money to 
<BR>
&quot;give them more&quot; will come from their very children that need the money to 
<BR>
raise their grandchildren.  Yet statistics show that we retirees have more 
<BR>
discretionary income than the group that is raising children.  Greed and lack 
<BR>
of foresight.
