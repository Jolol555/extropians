<P>Dunno about ability-weighted programmer hours, but one of The Register's
<BR>
columnists did an analysis last year of what went into a typical Linux
<BR>
distribution CD from Red Hat. Costing out programmer time at US $50K
<BR>
per year, and costing in the various supplementary packages that were
<BR>
originally funded as academic research projects, they came up with the
<BR>
startling figure that Linux &quot;cost&quot; US $8Bn to develop, over a 25 year
<BR>
period (although Linus only released his first kernel in 1991). This
<BR>
shows up most clearly when you think about things like X11, sendmail,
<BR>
gcc, Emacs (and the other GNU utilities) and evolutions of research
<BR>
projects like Postgres.
<BR>
<P>The point is that the expenses were borne by users, not by a vendor who
<BR>
then tried to make a cash cow out of it; the distributors earn their
<BR>
money from support and services, not by arbitrarily putting a price on
<BR>
the right to copy information and jealously defending it.
