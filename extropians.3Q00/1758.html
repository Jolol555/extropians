<P><EM>&gt; Greg, if I understand your question, the answer is &quot;yes&quot;. Computers have

<P>It is a very big field, coming under the heading of &quot;Theorem proving&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;Automated reasoning&quot;.  Lenat gave a great example at the Contact
<BR>
conference this year where Cyc had been ask to analyze some situations
<BR>
that the DoD/CIA invented (something like -- if Iran sinks a bunch of
<BR>
freighters in the straight of Hormouz (sp?), is there enough oil
<BR>
produced in the world to satisfy demand for 3 months if all other
<BR>
nations pumped at their maximum capacity?).  Cyc couldn't answer
<BR>
some the DoD/CIA analysts could, could answer some as well as they
<BR>
could and even answered a couple that they couldn't!
<BR>
<P>Related to the mathematical proof situation, Max is correct.
<BR>
A lot of work has been done over the last 30 years in these
<BR>
areas at Argonne especially.  A good place to start is:

<P><A HREF="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/new_results/">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/new_results/</A>
<BR>
<P>A major player in the past was Rusty Lusk, but the leaders now
<BR>
appears to be William McCune and Larry Wos.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly enough, Lusk moved on to help develop MPI
<BR>
(message passing interface) which was one of the areas I
<BR>
had to brush up on when reviewing computational strategies
<BR>
for MBrains...
<BR>
<P>Enjoy,
