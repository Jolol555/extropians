<EM>&gt;  &gt; If a large number of the developers get dissatisfied with the decisions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; of the manager, any of the developers can take the code base and fork
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; it.  The central manager would have to screw up big time in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; provoke such a reaction, but it is possible - and that, alone, can keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the manager honest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but then we're talking about two different projects. Since the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fork was provoked by a screwup on manager's part, one of them seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destined to crash and burn. There *are* a number of OpenSource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screwups out there.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Anarchic software development does not work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Define &quot;anarchic&quot;.  No body of law ties, say, Linux developers to Linus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Headless. No central arbitrator. Everybody can touch everything, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribute the end result under the same name. I'm not saying it can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work theoretically, but lacking angels it doesn't seem to work in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Torvaldis.  Linus can not hire or fire developers; he can only make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; acceptance of their code more or less likely.  (He can't even absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A great damn deal more or less likely. You try putting something into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel what Linus (or Alan Cox, or any of the core team) thinks is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; reject software on his own, though his negative review can go a long way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; towards rejecting certain code.)  Promises, trust, and working code are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Code that works for you might not work for me, and vice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; versa. Architectural decisions are frequently incompatible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; all that unify the developers - and this lack of law is, technically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;anarchy&quot;, in the form that some promoters of anarchy envision as their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; utopia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still see no evidence that there are nontrivial OpenSource projects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which work by pure anarchy. Can you name an example?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet as it is today has no particular guiding body, and every
<BR>
commercial, public, or otherwise private concern taking part in it simply
<BR>
adheres to standards to the extent that they choose interoperability with
<BR>
others.
<BR>
<P>As to whether the Internet is &quot;Open Source&quot;, there are open source applications
<BR>
for almost every standard used upon the Internet, whether the standards are due
<BR>
to current working bodies or the result of the anarchic, innovative ideas that
<BR>
were used at its inception and during its development..
<BR>
<P>An &quot;Open Source&quot; project might be anarchic, and there are many various coding
<BR>
and software design habits, but they are almost always built to a standard or
<BR>
specification, and the end result of any software design and implementation
<BR>
process either fits the specification or does not.
