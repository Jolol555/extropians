</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your use of the word 'inflict' is curious. Care to elaborate? =) Sorry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's that psychotherapy thread that's bleeding over into my keyboarding.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>My dictionary defines the word like this:  to cause (something...painful) to
<BR>
be endured; impose.
<BR>
<P>My experiences with men have almost all ended with my leaving (maybe ALL of
<BR>
them have ended that way; I can't think of any right off the top of my head
<BR>
where a man has voluntarily left me).  Even in relationships which initially
<BR>
began with the understanding that they would be flexible and open ended
<BR>
(which was more the pattern in the 60's and 70's when I was young than it
<BR>
seems to be now)they would end up with the man wanting more than I could
<BR>
give--predictability, stability, permanence, going everywhere with him,
<BR>
taking him everywhere with me--those sorts of things.
<BR>
<P>I used to say that if the men knew up front that I needed lots of solitude
<BR>
and independence and ended up getting too attached it was their problem, not
<BR>
mine.  I'd been honest up front about the sort of person I was, and they
<BR>
should have taken more care not to become dependent on my always being
<BR>
around. But after several instances of the same thing happening, I had to
<BR>
face it that there's something about me (or the men I get involved with, or
<BR>
both) that leads to their becoming &quot;madly in luv&quot; and &quot;needy and desperate.&quot;
<BR>
It's as though I'm cursed, an unwilling Siren. My mother tells me it's just
<BR>
that I've &quot;never met the right man.&quot;  I have my doubts about this.
<BR>
<P>And so, since by now I can pretty well predict what's going to happen, I
<BR>
would be knowingly causing something painful to any man I became involved
<BR>
with; therefore, inflicting myself, as in inflicting a punishment.
<BR>
<P>The monkish life I lead is for the most part pleasant.  I don't buy into the
<BR>
myth that a person must be married or otherwise tied to another human in
<BR>
order to be happy.  I DO miss trading back rubs, though.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
