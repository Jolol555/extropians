<EM>&gt; &gt;is it so clear what the directions of people's &quot;moral&quot; dispositions are...?

<EM>&gt;    &quot;... It is cruel to create an uploaded being that contains some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    those cryonics patients' humanity, but is missing a soul [or qualia ...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If the value of human labor could lose trillions of dollars, it is hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to see what could counter that motivation if it were happening today.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd guess that if animals suddenly became able to replace 30 or 40 percent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of human labor, that the animal rights movement would succeed in creating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough moral revulsion to animal labor to outlaw virtually all animal labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worldwide.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I can't figure out how long such a prohibition would remain enforceable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... you are claiming that people would never get upset over things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like digging up graves? ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It should be easy to create controversy over what [scan] info is relevant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... I look at movements to repudiate slavery, child labor, human cloning,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and genetically modified foods and see a much more mixed picture than you do.
</EM><BR>
<P>My main point was that it isn't so much that people are morally against
<BR>
uploads, as that there are lots or related hot buttons that can push people
<BR>
either way, depending on where their interests lie.  If people feel their
<BR>
wages are threatened, then yes they might discover moral objections.  But
<BR>
it is the wage threat, not the moral objections, that would drive things.
<BR>
<P>I like your animal analogy, but expect the opposite in that hypothetical.
<BR>
I don't know if people would go as far as planet of the apes in enslaving
<BR>
animals, but they wouldn't just ignore this huge source of wealth.
<BR>
<P>Imagine one country, say Cuba or North Korea, decides to use these apes
<BR>
internally, and their economy starts booming.  Their exports shoot up, they
<BR>
get rich, and people like to visit there.  Some of the countries that used
<BR>
to sell the things they sell now sell less of them.   Would the rest of the
<BR>
world really invade these countries, or blockade them, to prevent this?
