<EM>&gt; Here's an obvious scenario leading to illegal transparency: if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveilance technology ever becomes as ubiquitous and cheap as David
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Brin thinks that it might be, Congress could pass laws prohibiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain kinds of observations or the use of certain kinds of equipment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the grounds of &quot;protecting personal privacy&quot;; these laws would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funded by special interest groups with secrets to keep and would even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be supported by a large fraction of the populace, perhaps even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority.  (Who wants some pervert watching your every move?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, for their next trick, the government could completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminate the black market for surveilance equipment by monopolizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its use, er, I mean, limiting its use to select law enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; officials only.  It's to keep the streets safer, you see.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a plausible and frightening scenario, but it is not what David
<BR>
Brin described as his transparent society.  You seem to be saying that
<BR>
transparency is unstable and will degenerate into Orwellian surveillance.
<BR>
That may be the case, but for the sake of the argument it would be
<BR>
helpful to assume that David's dream works out and we do in fact have
<BR>
mutual transparency.
<BR>
<P>The problem in a nutshell is, you can outlaw peeping toms, but the only
<BR>
way to catch someone breaking the law from the privacy of their home
<BR>
is to be a peeping tom yourself.  Maybe you could make an exception in
<BR>
this case, and say that being a peeping tom is illegal, except for the
<BR>
case of peeping at a peeping tom.  But then, how would you know that you
<BR>
could legally peep?  Alternatively you could accept anonymous evidence of
<BR>
peeping, but that runs into issues of fairness, provenance of evidence,
<BR>
facing the accuser and so on.
<BR>
<P>I think what David envisioned was that being a peeping tom would be
<BR>
shameful, and so no one would do it because they would know they might
<BR>
be caught.  But that still has something of the same problem; if you're
<BR>
caught you don't have to feel much shame since you know that the person
<BR>
who caught you was committing the same crime.  It seems more likely
<BR>
that customs would evolve to allow peeping, if such technology came
<BR>
into existence.
<BR>
<P>And if so then that makes the IP problem harder to solve than ever,
<BR>
which was where I came in...
