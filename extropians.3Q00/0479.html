<EM>&gt;are telling me they are changing their mind, about extropism. Now they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think that extropians are not a *sect* as Ansa (a sort of italian Reuters) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;announced many months ago (but I did not read this).Of course: they still 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do not *embrace the future* (the best known extropic motto, in Italy) and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they do not believe in *omega-points* (the second best known extropic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thing, in Italy).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scerir
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, good to see that their attitude has towards extropianism has improved, 
<BR>
at least. BTW, I don't believe in Omega- points either! I personally feel 
<BR>
that it is a part of transhumanism that should be rather downplayed because 
<BR>
it diverts the ideology's interest from the important parts, the analysis of 
<BR>
the present and strategies for the present. Transhumanism often falls into 
<BR>
the trap of discussing VERY remote technologies, while completely neglecting 
<BR>
the present. I think it is because, if we're discussing the present topics 
<BR>
like economics, philosophy, sociology etc come into the forefront. But those 
<BR>
are not topics that people in general discuss at all- they are so mired in 
<BR>
what is considered &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;moral&quot; today that transhumanists even 
<BR>
adopt the stasist point of view towards them (comes with the fact of a 
<BR>
hegemony being present in these topics). So you can here bizarre statements 
<BR>
like &quot;I don't want any changes in politics and economics as of today, but I 
<BR>
think somehow we will have nanotech, but it shouldn't have any sociological 
<BR>
impact&quot;. This of course damages the credibility of transhumanism, asit is 
<BR>
unable to make a good analysis of the present and of the way to implement 
<BR>
the transhuman IDEOLOGY (of which the technological solutions are just a 
<BR>
minor part) in the future.
<BR>
<P>Kind of reminds me of a truck I saw in the US with two stickers on it. The 
<BR>
first one said &quot;member of the NRA&quot;, the second said &quot;support Clinton/ Gore&quot;. 
<BR>
Unfortunately it could also be an illustration of the same philosophical 
<BR>
errors that some transhumans commit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;p.s.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Note that Italy appreciated so much, during ' 60, the french catholic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosopher Teilhard de Chardin and his omega-point-human-deity !
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Hmm, Sartre was also loved in Italy in the '60s. It was a very open time.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Waldemar
