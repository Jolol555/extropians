<EM>&gt; &gt; Corporations are a matter of people getting together cooperatively to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; organize their efforts.  How can it be evil for a group of people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; voluntarily organize, and to offer jobs to others?  Every aspect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the process, from the formation of the corporation, to the job offer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the acceptance, is voluntary and agreed to by all concerned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;Actually, corporations receive limitations on their liability.  So if,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for example, a simple business partnership up the block from me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accidentally causes my house to be blown up, I might be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;successfully sue the business owners to recover damages.  But if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very same people have organized the otherwise identical business as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporation and do the very same thing, due to their magical limited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;liability, the corporation must pay but the stockholders do not, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their liability is limited.  Now, perhaps the corporation does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possess the resources to pay, but the stockholders do.  In that case I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believe I would be out of luck.  Of course there are sometimes ways to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;pierce the corporate veil&quot; (sounds exciting doesn't it?).  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different standards of liability apply in different cases.  IANAL.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But still, people incorporate for the liability limitations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The only difference in the two instances could be that in the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case the business might be a simple partnership, and in the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case it was a corporation, having duly filed &quot;articles of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incorporation&quot; with the secretary of state of the state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Massachusetts.  And therefore in one case I can recover damages from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the business owners and in the other case I might not.  This strikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me as something which materially affects me to which I never agreed.
</EM><BR>

<P>In fact, the push by the &quot;progressives&quot; of the latter 19th century - 
<BR>
trust-busting, regulatory boards, etc., was actually a Satanic Pact, if ever 
<BR>
there was one.  In exchange for accepting state control of one's business - 
<BR>
which is what one does when one incorporates (think of all the business 
<BR>
regulations, and all the bureacrats who feed off them) - one gets the .ltd 
<BR>
stamp, and if you make a risky bet on your chemical plant (or nuclear 
<BR>
processing facility) then you lose the company, but you personally walk 
<BR>
scott free.
<BR>
<P>Talk about socially irresponsible policy.  The leftist &quot;progressives&quot; 
<BR>
(Lovely term, like &quot;Pro-Life, you know) undercut every common law avenue of 
<BR>
recourse.  You could no longer make a common law suit against a corporation 
<BR>
- not if it was already covered in regulatory statute, with 
<BR>
slap-on-the-wrist fines and ten inspectors (nine of whom somehow owned 
<BR>
second homes in Burmuda) to cover an entire state.
<BR>
<P>How many disasters are lurking out there as a consequence is anybody's 
<BR>
guess.  Somewhere outside of Athens, GA, for example, there is an old 
<BR>
nuclear waste disposal site, right next to a sizeable steam.  The records 
<BR>
for it have long disappeared.  It was already abandoned in the late '60's, 
<BR>
when I stumbled accross it.  The private group that has been trying to 
<BR>
locate all such sites for twenty years has also heard about it, but they 
<BR>
haven't had the manpower or money to do the kind of investigations needed.
