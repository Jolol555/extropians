<EM>&gt; Yep. His real name is Piers Anthony Dillingham Jacob.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For a list of everything he's written (and published),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see <A HREF="http://www.piers-anthony.com/complist.html">http://www.piers-anthony.com/complist.html</A>

</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. Also, see <A HREF="http://www.pulpless.com/volksamp/autobio.html">http://www.pulpless.com/volksamp/autobio.html</A>.  I've read
<BR>
some forty or fifty of them.  When I was young, he was my favorite
<BR>
author.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Personally, my attention span at this stage would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not provide the output of a good novel, although I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think myself to be a decent writer, and to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surrounded by many of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have the same problem... several times I've started
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some story or another, and may have all sorts of cool
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas, but I just can't manage to get more than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small bit done before I lose focus and stop (this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excluding school assignments, of course, which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fortunately have managed to finish ;) ). What little I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have written has gotten plenty of compliments from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who have seen it, but I just don't have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; focus to be able to actually write more than a bit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a long story (the only non-assigned things I've ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finished have been short poems and very short
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stories). I don't know why; I probably could if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really tried, because I don't have this much trouble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; focusing on other things, but it's a different kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; focusing... I dunno. Whatever. :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Last time I posted about fiction was a couple years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ago, it is in the archives somewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd like to read it if you could find it... I've been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having a lot of trouble with the archives (especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that blasted search engine) for several months now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Onward,

<P>The question of archives is one.
<BR>
<P>As these zero and one bits representing information are so easily
<BR>
maintained, and storage for it being ubiquitous, there are archives of
<BR>
very many transactions that have ever taken place electronically.
<BR>
<P>One place to look, broadly, is <A HREF="http://www.archive.org">http://www.archive.org</A>, the goal of which
<BR>
at one time was to store every single thing ever on the Internet.
<BR>
<P>More specifically, these mailing lists are distributed to each of the
<BR>
readers, and each has their own personal archive, those which have been
<BR>
received and not deleted.  The lists' administrators mostly have
<BR>
complete archives of their contents.  In terms of newsgroups, another
<BR>
largescale communication forum, there are archives of probably all
<BR>
USENET posts, ever, although I could not say.
<BR>
<P>About the specific post, it was on the extropians list.  I look some,
<BR>
and it appears my first post was on about March 20, 1999 (I was thinking
<BR>
it was longer ago).  I believe it was within a month or two of that, and
<BR>
was basically of a discussion of science fiction, which was my preferred
<BR>
genre to read.  Now then, how to get that from the archive is another
<BR>
matter. There is an extropians list archive search engine, as there are
<BR>
for many other lists, and basically any e-mail files in raw form may be
<BR>
searched using UNIX's &quot;grep&quot; or any other decent file text extraction
<BR>
tool.  So, I don't recall if at the last time I went to the extropians
<BR>
search engine whether it was functioning or not, I believe not.  That is
<BR>
a question to address to the list administrators.
<BR>
<P>Thusly:  what is the regular capacity for any to access any posts ever
<BR>
made to the extropians list, and by what means is it accomplished?
<BR>
<P>I could never write fiction again.
