<P><EM>&gt; Can't help you with this one. Tipler (in his reclusiveness) never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seemed to state that he believed in religion, merely that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ultimate future appeared to closely resemble some religious aspects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regarding eschatology.
</EM><BR>
<P>He might not be saying &quot;Omega == God&quot;, but he definitely hints it
<BR>
extremely strongly. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most dogmatic scientists, yes I do use that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; word, dogmatism, purposefully, simply disregard Tipler, because he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; messes with their world view. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Only partially; sure, there are plenty of physicists who think that
<BR>
there should be waterproof boundaries between physics and religion,
<BR>
but there are many other reasons to scoff at Tipler.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of the attacks, I have seen in the last six years; most seem not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disagree with the physics behind it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have seen plenty of attacks that disagree with the physics, there
<BR>
are many very weak points and assumptions there. Most attackers are of
<BR>
course not very detailled, like the SciAm reviewer of PoI they just
<BR>
scoff at the notion of a supercomputer built out of nuclear plasma and
<BR>
simular undemonstrated wild stuff, but there has been many good points
<BR>
raised too (e.g. spacetime quantization, black hole horizons - and of
<BR>
course the open universe).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of the attacks, I have seen in the last six years; most seem not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disagree with the physics behind it. But they are dead set against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making conclusions regarding the future universe, that might include
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any resemblences to what religion had sugested. That is where Tipler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has gotten his chops busted.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure. But even if you disregard that, there is a lot of relevant
<BR>
criticism. In addition, the idea has now been adopted by many people
<BR>
who are twisting it to their own ends in science fiction, religion,
<BR>
new age or transhumanism - since it is not firmly based on observable
<BR>
facts, especially not in its mutated forms, it can become anything. 
<BR>
<P>I *like* Tiplers calculations, they were what made me become a
<BR>
transhumanist. But when he tried to make the OP not just a possibility
<BR>
but a necessity in his cosmology, then he made a big mistake both from
<BR>
a science point of view and from a religious point of view.
