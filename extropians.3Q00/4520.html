<P>
I've been reading this thread with interest (sorry - lurking again), and I
<BR>
think the question that is more to the point is &quot;Why would AI want to be
<BR>
_unfriendly_?&quot;
<BR>
<P>The extermination (or enslavement) of several billion people would surely
<BR>
require an expenditure of a considerable amount of time and energy - even
<BR>
for an SI.  What motivation could it have for doing so ?
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that most sapients consider diversity to be a very important
<BR>
thing - why would a A/SI not think the same.  To keep humans around would
<BR>
require very little expense to the SI, while at the same time providing it
<BR>
with an enormous pool of intellectual diversity.
<BR>
<P>The notion that an SI would just wake up and decide to wipe out humanity
<BR>
strikes me as absurd - to do so would require tremendous arrogance, and I
<BR>
would hope that something supposedly more intelligent than us would realise
<BR>
how stupid it was being.
