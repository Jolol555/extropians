</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It was one of the last &quot;games&quot; I spent a LOT of time with and was, without
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt, the best over-all space simulator I ever encountered.  It had some
</EM><BR>
odd
<BR>
<EM>&gt; characteristics that indicated that developing it had not been a high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; priority in MS.  It was a DOS-based game and was never happy in Windows.
</EM><BR>
In
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, I tried to run it in Win98 and it was a no-starter (probably good
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; me).  Even when it was new the graphics component wasn't that good -- not
</EM><BR>
up
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to then-current state of the art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The basic ballistics algorithms were great, though, and I had a lot of fun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tweaking orbits.  I can recall spending a frighteningly large amount of
</EM><BR>
time
<BR>
<EM>&gt; playing at lowering the perfectly circular orbit of a spacecraft around
</EM><BR>
Luna
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to the absolute LOWEST possible altitude.  Unfortunately, the graphics
</EM><BR>
engine
<BR>
<EM>&gt; wasn't great, so you didn't get the images of craters and mountains
</EM><BR>
zipping
<BR>
<EM>&gt; past that would have been nice.  Also, the aerodynamics simulation when
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; were in the Earth's atmosphere was piss-poor, especially considering the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state of MS's Flight Sim in those days.  Something that seems like it
</EM><BR>
would
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have been a natural to do would have been to marry the two with a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interface, so you could shift back and forth between the two with the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vehicles.  No such luck: MS let Space Simulator die, with no upgrades.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Finally, there was no good ballistics analysis tool to help generate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rendezvous calculations -- you had to &quot;cheat&quot; or spend unreasonable
</EM><BR>
amounts
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of fuel guestimating to do a rendezvous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect that the market for a REALLY accurate space simulator must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small, or someone would have done it . . .

<P>Very small indeed. Sadly.
<BR>
<P>There are some really dynamite old games around, which wont work in current
<BR>
OSes. I keep &quot;Tie Fighter&quot; around, because I just loved that game - I know
<BR>
the flight model is naughty, but the game itself is fantastic. Doom (I) is
<BR>
another big one (maybe that will work under windows?).
<BR>
<P>I've given up trying to get those games to run under win 9x (actually I use
<BR>
NT, which makes possibilities really remote).
<BR>
<P>What I'm intending to do is get a really hot little 486 together, or maybe a
<BR>
low end pentium, with heaps of memory &amp; HD space, totally over specced. You
<BR>
know, like 16 meg of ram and maybe even a 1 gig hd. Wow! Then pop DOS 6 on,
<BR>
config it to do all kinds of tricks so that there's upwards of 700K of base
<BR>
memory available, and away we go! There are a whole bunch of excellent games
<BR>
from the era when that was state of the art, which I could never play
<BR>
properly because my machine wasn't top of the line; I always wanted to come
<BR>
back to them in the future and give it a real go. I guess I'm in the future
<BR>
now (Year 2000!), so it's time.
<BR>
<P>Is anyone actually doing this? Is it as fun as I suspect?
<BR>
