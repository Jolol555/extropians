When Vinge first got Marooned in Realtime in Analog back in the 1980's, I 
<BR>
didn't get it. Story-telling as an attempt to illustrate scientific or 
<BR>
philiosophical concepts must be extremely trying as a type pf communication.  
<BR>
A Fire Upon the Deep was better because Vinge was creative enough to use the 
<BR>
&quot;net newsgroup feeds&quot; and they were integral to the plot also.

<P>&lt;&lt; Heh. In MAROONED, the Singularity is a Disappearance (an Implosion, sort
<BR>
&nbsp;of) and it is *explicitly* preceded by gestalt people with
<BR>
&nbsp;radio-telepathy... (To be stuck a few seconds away from the Earth-Moon
<BR>
&nbsp;nexus, Vinge's near-Singularity character tells us bleakly, was hellishly
<BR>
&nbsp;depriving.)
