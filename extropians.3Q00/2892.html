<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Digital Angel, said Zhou, &quot;will be a connection from yourself to the

<EM>&gt; &gt; I like it!  Although I admit that the hard sell propaganda sounds a wee bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scary.  My &quot;guardian,&quot; my &quot;protector?&quot;  It will bring good things to me?

<EM>&gt; They didnt say how much it costs.  If reasonable, Ill take one.  Recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some time ago I bought up the notion of a group of volunteers who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are willing to have *every* aspect of their lives open to scrutiny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by anyone.  Heres one application: testing the new human ID implants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another is voice recognition and verification for purchases.  Ill do it!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pick meeeeeeee!

<EM>&gt; Zero, you and I were among those who were advocating a more transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society.  This latest little girl who was kidnapped Thursday and was recovered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yesterday could be the poster child for open society.  How about it, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parents?  Would you be in favor of ID implants for your kids?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Put it in kids, prisoners, convicts, and dangerous dogs, and whoever is
<BR>
dumb enough to beleive that the corps and govs want you to have it for
<BR>
your own good. Not me, thanks.

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
