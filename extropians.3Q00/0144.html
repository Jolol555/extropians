<P><EM>&gt; And when success was first triumphantly announced was there anything said

<EM>&gt; about a beacon, or a heater that was used on another test until years later?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  This was not a test of a seeker or target discrimination, it had
<BR>
to do with endgame control, a daring design of a kill vehicle with
<BR>
cruciform nozzles and no explosive, i.e. body to body contact kill.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Did the military say this had nothing to do with a practical weapon?
</EM><BR>
<P>It *did* have something to do with a practical weapon.  You need
<BR>
to demonstrate hit to kill before any of the rest of it makes sense
<BR>
to pursue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Their credibility is zero, if they wish to regain people's trust there is only one thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do, declassify EVERYTHING.
</EM><BR>
<P>hmmm, I dont think we want them to declassify *everything* do
<BR>
we?  Would not that make any defensive system less useful, to
<BR>
point out to the enemy where the weak points are?  Remember,
<BR>
the defensive system has done its job if an enemy wisely decides
<BR>
not to attack it, knowing it is unsure of the outcome.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No &quot;test&quot; has told us a thing about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how a nuclear enemy could be defeated.
</EM><BR>
<P>THAAD demonstrated hit to kill.  Last week the military
<BR>
ordered a bunch of these missiles.  The target discrimination
<BR>
aspects are classified.  Will anyone bet their nation that
<BR>
THAAD can be fooled?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;ERIS was a proof-of-concept  that later led to the THAAD system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Proof of what concept, that under the right condition a missile can shoot down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another missile?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That didn't need proving everybody already knew it was true,
</EM><BR>
<P>We did?  There was still a lot of debate whether hit-to-kill
<BR>
could *ever* be made to work.  I would not have bet on it
<BR>
until I saw it done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I want to know if a practical ABM system can ever be made to work.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do too.  We all want to know that.  Thats what tests are for.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The customer was the taxpayer, and I know of at least one who wasn't very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheerful about the sham.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmm, you do bring up an interesting point.  The whole process
<BR>
is filled with irony.  The persons developing the defenses are not
<BR>
cleared to know the threats.  The persons developing targets to
<BR>
simulate the threats are not cleared to know the capability of the
<BR>
defenses.  The persons in charge of choosing the defense systems
<BR>
are cleared to know both, and those actually paying the bills, the
<BR>
taxpayers, are not cleared for nothing.
<BR>
<P>Good point, dont know the answer, dont think declassifying
<BR>
everything is a good idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; A THAAD missile is far cheaper than the cost of the plutonium for a nuke alone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Baloney! There is a worldwide glut of plutonium...As I said before only a few pounds can make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bomb.
</EM><BR>
<P>And those few pounds are hard to get.  THAAD missiles are not
<BR>
all that complicated as hardware systems go.  The real magic is
<BR>
in the software, which can be replicated free.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for the vehicle itself, a defensive missile need to be super accurate, it's error radius
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must be measured in inches. If an offensive missile's error radius is a hundred miles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's fine.
</EM><BR>
<P>100 miles?  I *hope* Im a hundred miles away.  John you have
<BR>
seen films of the H bomb tests at Bikini, have you not?  Re-
<BR>
estimate that destruction radius.  It isnt 100 miles.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A defensive missile absolutely positively must work perfectly every single time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware like that doesn't come cheap. If 9 out of 10 offensive ICBMs fail on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; launch it doesn't matter, with so much overkill the vast majority of H bombs would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do nothing but bounce charred bones and rubble anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, IF it is Russia doing the attacking, yes they have a jillion
<BR>
nukes.  A terrorist wont have that many.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can make offensive decoys that cost almost nothing
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but the cost of actually firing one at a nuclear capable
<BR>
target would be high indeed, would it not?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One ICBM can have dozens of warheads and thousands of decoys.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but this is a capability far beyond the present capability
<BR>
of the U.S.  I dont expect a terrorist to come up with such
<BR>
a sophisticated device.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;The blue team builds the targets, the red team builds the interceptor,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;the white team watches both to make sure nobody cheats.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you seriously trying to tell me that they're building targets for this thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as cleverly as they know how to do? Ridiculous.
</EM><BR>
<P>They have constraints.  The white team (the customer, who knows
<BR>
the level of threats thru various means not available to us) decides
<BR>
what level of technology, what budget it will allow the blue team
<BR>
to have.
<BR>
<P>Ideally every test should have a 50-50 chance of success from
<BR>
the white team's point of view.  Of course, the blue team and the
<BR>
red team will each be reporting models suggesting a higher than
<BR>
50% chance of success.  If the white team thinks one side has
<BR>
a way better chance than the other, they will likely postpone the
<BR>
test so as not to waste expensive targets on a test that is either
<BR>
too hard or too easy.  In fact that is exactly what happened to the
<BR>
third and final THAAD test.  The white team decided the THAAD
<BR>
missile had a very high likelihood of intercept, so they postponed
<BR>
the test to give the target team a chance to get some new tricks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the blue team does too good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a job I have no doubt their chances of promotion would be zero. In the history of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the world has this &quot;white team&quot; of yours ever objected to anything?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.  See above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;      &gt; I can assure you the blue team is doing  everything it can do to fool the target
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;discrimination red team.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then they're not very smart and we're unlikely to encounter an enemy that dumb.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you be sure?  How?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And they won't be in service when their needed because I'll destroy them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before I attack.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh?  And you do realize of course that attacking orbiting assets
<BR>
is an act of war, and that a well-known nuclear capable nation has the
<BR>
means of determining exactly where this anti-sat attack originated.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unlike missiles, satellites are in orbit, I know exactly where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are at all times. Satellites work great in peacetime but you can't rely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on them in war.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see.  So then the logic behind Milstar is....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; of course the Union of Concerned Scientist's credibility is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; not exactly stellar in this particular field.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've not heard anything bad about them but it doesn't matter...
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesnt?  They are speculating about matters for which they
<BR>
are not cleared.  Do scientists do such things?  Should they not
<BR>
call themselves the Union of Concerned Politicians?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the idea of putting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the warhead in a aluminized balloon is a good one...
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless we have some means of defeating it.  Do you know
<BR>
that mylar balloons were once used as a visible band and
<BR>
high frequency decoy for fighter planes?  I saw them fail to
<BR>
spoof an AIM9R, and that was 16 yrs ago.  Has mylar
<BR>
improved that much?  Would you bet your life on it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;the government is not going to do it on Friday's test, they're afraid to.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose thats one explanation, however if such a simple
<BR>
countermeasure is thought to be effective, they would be
<BR>
afraid to *not* use them.  Remember, intercept test outcomes
<BR>
are not classified because they cannot be: anyone with a
<BR>
telescope can watch and will either see a huge flash or no.
<BR>
But target discrimination tests are classified as all hell.  I
<BR>
dont know what can and cannot be done.  But it is informative
<BR>
that those who choose the weapons to buy are going ahead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can imagine anything that doesn't violate the laws of physics, but I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want something from the imagination, I want a practical system.
</EM><BR>
<P>As do we all.  How do we get there, other than build it, a
<BR>
piece at a time?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; however in some other spectral bands an aluminized mylar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;balloon is as transparent as a condom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, an X ray laser scanning system that can fit inside a very small rocket and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can make the determination in a few nanoseconds.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fit inside a small rocket?  That LADAR must already be in orbit
<BR>
to be of any use when called upon.  Agreed you cant wait until
<BR>
attacked to launch.  I dont think anyone has suggested that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Spend a few hundred billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollars and I'll bet you could come up with something that worked pretty well, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lab. Congratulations, you have taken your first step in fighting your way inside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 79 cent plastic bag.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, one which *might* contain a nuke.  A few hundred billion
<BR>
for that information is a good deal, is it not?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Such a rocket would be of extremely short range so you'd need thousands.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja.  So build em.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; perhaps millions to cover the entire continental USA
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja.  So build em.  Whats a city worth?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; , but it wouldn't help anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not?  Do you suppose a nuke missile could run such
<BR>
a gauntlet?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'll first send a warhead to detonate 50 or 60 miles above your city,
</EM><BR>
<P>First?  You mean, fire upon a nuclear capable power, who can
<BR>
trace the launch from the second you fire the engine, and who
<BR>
has submarines full of MIRV capable defenses cruising silently
<BR>
somewhere in the sea, perhaps not so far from your launch site.
<BR>
So now, think quickly for these MIRVs are on their way, and will
<BR>
remove all traces of your existence in as little as 15 minutes, regardless
<BR>
if your scheme was successful.  You will never know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; even in the unlikely  event your electronics are not fried by the EMP the resulting huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cloud of plasma
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be opaque to light, RADAR and infrared, I could send anything I wanted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through it and you'd never know until it was much too late.
</EM><BR>
<P>So you are postulating that you are Russia, with a jillion missiles
<BR>
which can be fired simultaneously?  OK, right, this system can
<BR>
be defeated by that.  Nowthen, are you a terrorist, with one, two
<BR>
or say... five missiles?  Do you feel lucky?  Are you willing to
<BR>
pay the supreme price for a chance to hurt the great satan?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; then we should stay indefinitely with no-defense?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not something we choose, it's just the way things are.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats the way things are *now*.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wish defense had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gained the upper hand over offense too, but wishing does not make it so.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree: wishing does not make it so.  MAKING IT SO makes it so.
<BR>
<P>John, we are standing on the threshold of a dream, man.  There
<BR>
will come a day, if we have the courage to make it so, when the best
<BR>
defense is a strong defense.  We can do it!  Nuke missiles are a
<BR>
technology that has stood still long enough that we can defeat them!
<BR>
But we need to work at it, and yes its expensive, and yes it is
<BR>
limited and yes I understand that it implies eventually a totally
<BR>
transparent society and yes yes yes, I do understand the frustrations
<BR>
of concerned scientists who are intentionally frozen out of the game,
<BR>
but they have chosen to not go into that field, get clearances, work
<BR>
on these systems.  Let us make it so, shall we?  spike
