<P><EM>&gt; don't think so. Hypnagogic trance is quite a bit different in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;literature I've read. There are also many different facets to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sleepwaling, OOB and alien abduction stuff. I don't think you can lump 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all three together fully and certainly not under &quot;hypnagogic trance&quot;. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Especially since hypnagogic effects are part of everyone's sleep cycle. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The experience I and others have described is not at all like being in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trance condition. I have never experienced these other effects and as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;far as I know am not prone to any of them. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Can someone give me a good reference for hypnagogic trance, please?
<BR>
<P>I spent several years in my childhood (7-9) sleep-walking.  I didn't
<BR>
think that I was in any special trance state. For me, it was part of
<BR>
my nightly sleep. Noone thought very much about it (although it
<BR>
worried my parents a little during the year my family and I were
<BR>
living on our sailboat).
<BR>
<P>I found the following reference to &quot;hypnagogic trance&quot;, but I don't
<BR>
know if it is a reputable reference. (I'm skeptical.)

<P>We are in the midst of a revolution focusing on the study of
<BR>
consciousness (Owens 1995). Penfield (1975), an eminent contemporary
<BR>
neurophysiologist, found that the human mind continued to work in
<BR>
spite of the brain's reduced activity under anesthesia. Brain waves
<BR>
were nearly absent while the mind was just as active as in the waking
<BR>
state. The only difference was in the content of the conscious
<BR>
experience. Following Penfield's work, other researchers have reported
<BR>
awareness in comatose patients (Hunt 1995) and there is a growing body
<BR>
of evidence which suggests that reduced cortical arousal while
<BR>
maintaining conscious awareness is possible (Fischer 1971; West 1980;
<BR>
Delmonte 1984; Wallace 1986; Goleman 1988; Mavromatis 1991; Jevning,
<BR>
Wallace, &amp; Beidenbach 1992). These states are variously referred to as
<BR>
meditative, trance, altered, hypnagogic, hypnotic, and
<BR>
twilight-learning states (Budzynski 1986). These various forms of
<BR>
consciousness rest on the maintenance of awareness in a
<BR>
physiologically reduced state of arousal marked by parasympathetic
<BR>
dominance (Mavromatis 1991). Highly hypnotizable subjects and adept
<BR>
meditators have demonstrated that maintaining consciousness with
<BR>
reduced cortical arousal is indeed possible in selected individuals,
<BR>
either as a natural ability or as an acquired skill (Sabourin,
<BR>
Cutcomb, Crawford, &amp; Pribram 1993). More and more scientists are
<BR>
expressing doubts about the neurologists' brain-mind model because it
<BR>
fails to answer so many questions about our ordinary experiences and
<BR>
evades our mystical and spiritual queries. Studies in distant mental
<BR>
influence and mental healing also challenge the notion of a mind
<BR>
localized within the brain (Dossey 1994; Dossey 1996). Nonlocal events
<BR>
have been proven to occur at the subatomic level and some researchers
<BR>
believe that the physics principles behind these events also underlie
<BR>
nonlocal consciousness-mediated effects (Dossey 1996). The scientific
<BR>
evidence supporting the phenomenon of remote viewing alone is
<BR>
sufficient to show that mind-consciousness is not a local phenomenon
<BR>
(McMoneagle 1993).
