<EM>&gt; &gt;Nazi experiment:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Put 12 million Jews in concentration camps. Have them pray for their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;lives, and begin killing them one by one. See if God saves them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Yes, a few surviving rabbis no longer believe in God, because of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;experiences.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess it depends on how you view that 50% filled glass of water.  After
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the good guys won the war, the Nazi regime was utterly decimated,
</EM><BR>
Hitler
<BR>
<EM>&gt; was killed, more than a few concentration camp prisoners did survive, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Jews came out of it with their own State which is one of the best
</EM><BR>
armed
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and most prosperous in the world (certainly in the middle east anyway).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd say that's as good a case for the God-answers-prayers meme as any.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is kind of like when two people survive a freak accident where hundreds
<BR>
are killed.  They call it a miracle, yet the accident itself is
<BR>
miraculous -- unlikely, except in hindsight -- and the hundreds killed might
<BR>
seem more like an Act of God than the two saved.
<BR>
<P>As for the Nazis, yeah, they are no longer around as a nation, but this is
<BR>
after six years of war, millions of people killed and turning Europe into
<BR>
rubble, then into two armed camps (NATO and the Soviets).  If this is God
<BR>
answering prayers for the Jews and others truly decimated (how many people
<BR>
survived the camps versus the number who didn't?), I'd hate to see what
<BR>
happens when he doesn't answer prayers!  Does the Earth fall into the Sun?
<BR>
<P>Also, while Israel does exist, its prosperity is mostly the result of US
<BR>
funding.  If that's prayers being answered, then I guess every person on
<BR>
welfare -- including big corporations like AMD and some African dictators --
<BR>
should get down on their knees and praise the Lord.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I know Zero is only talking about this reinforcing a meme...
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
