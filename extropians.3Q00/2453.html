<EM>&gt;From: Max Møller Rasmussen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:maxm@normik.dk?Subject=Re:%20The%20Future%20of%20Music%20(was:%20Re:%20e-book%20pricing)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F26Rqf69aZbLAX3cf3e00000b92@hotmail.com&gt;">maxm@normik.dk</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;Fra: Zero Powers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Its no secret in the music industry that over 75% of the cost of a CD 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;into manufacturing, packaging, distribution and record company profit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about 1/5 of the price pays for actual production of the recording and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;payment to the artist.  It is *only* that 1/5 that I have any desire to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The cost of a CD consists of several layers:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Demo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Recording
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Graphic-artwork
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Music video
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;CD-Production
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Advertising campaign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Distribution (transport/stores)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sales tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A CD-Production costs about $1 including packaging and printing of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;booklet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So yes you can save that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You can also save most of the distribution costs. Especially as bandwith
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gets cheaper.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But that still leaves:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Demo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Recording
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Graphic-artwork
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Music video
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Advertising campaign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sales tax
</EM><BR>
<P>If I'm purchasing an MP3, and *only* an MP3, I don't feel I should have to 
<BR>
pay for:
<BR>
<P>Graphic-artwork (don't come with the MP3);
<BR>
Music video (don't come with the MP3);
<BR>
Advertising campaign (I get no benefit from that);
<BR>
sales tax (so far the net is still pretty much tax free, and that's fine by 
<BR>
me)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A million artist doing their own website for promoting music will not do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that. I have no time to search all that information. I don't even have time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to do it on mp3.com as they take in everything. All I have ever heard (well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;almost all) on mp3.com is demo quality at best. An artist is not the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;judge of his own work. Thus I want a filtering infrastructure that can give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ME the high quality music that I like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is what a recording company should do (You can also call them editors,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;critics etc. Same difference.). So I don't think they will go away. I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want them to go away.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, the recording companies do perform the much needed job of filtering.  
<BR>
However, looking at it from a cost-benefit analysis, I don’t think that 
<BR>
service is worth the huge chunk of the cost of the CD that I pay for that 
<BR>
service.  I think the filtering job could be done just as well (if not 
<BR>
better) and much more efficiently by other methods.  Say commercial radio, 
<BR>
word of mouth, etc.  So, while I agree with you that record companies will 
<BR>
not be going away anytime soon, I for one would not be sad to see them go.
