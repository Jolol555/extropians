<P>the piece displayed at the above site contains the
<BR>
following paragraph:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Can our self-image of fuzzy free spirits long
</EM><BR>
survive when the genome proves that life, at its
<BR>
deepest level, is scripted by a logical program? The
<BR>
program's control is so tight that, as has long been
<BR>
known, a single error in the instructions can cause
<BR>
malfunctions such as sickle-cell anemia and other
<BR>
hereditary diseases&quot;
<BR>
<P>the image becomes less like a rigidly engineered
<BR>
machine and more like a free-spirited dance when one
<BR>
considers transposons, or &quot;jumping genes.&quot;
<BR>
<P>i quote below from

&quot;microbial genetics 428 lecture notes&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;In the 1940s, Dr. Barbara McClintock discovered that
<BR>
certain &quot;regulatory elements&quot; in maize could move from
<BR>
site-to-site and, by doing so, affect gene expression.
<BR>
Dr. McClintock's work was initially met with
<BR>
skepticism and doubt. Ultimately, her work resulted in
<BR>
a Nobel Prize. However, it was not until ca. 30 years
<BR>
later that similar mobile genetic elements were found
<BR>
in bacteria. These genetic elements move at a low
<BR>
frequency (10^(-7) to 10^(-2) depending on the
<BR>
element). The movement of these elements can alter
<BR>
gene expression and in some cases even the
<BR>
organization of genes within a chromosome. Thus, our
<BR>
perception of the genome of an organism has changed
<BR>
and it is now regarded as being fluid rather than
<BR>
static. 
<BR>
<P>The primary reason for this state of flux is due to
<BR>
the presence of Insertion Sequences (IS's) and
<BR>
transposons (Tn's) in the DNA. These mobile genetic
<BR>
elements were named to reflect the fact that they can
<BR>
move or &quot;transpose&quot; themselves from place to place in
<BR>
the DNA. How these transposons &quot;move&quot; around in the
<BR>
DNA of an organism is fascinating and differs from
<BR>
normal homologous recombination.&quot;
<BR>
<P>transposons not only move from place to place in the
<BR>
dna, but are also turned on and off at various times
<BR>
in the development of a cell.
<BR>
<P>i do not know of any research concerning the play of
<BR>
transposons in the human brain, but it seems likely
<BR>
that such does take place.
