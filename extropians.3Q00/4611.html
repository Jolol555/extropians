<P>The *stable marriage* problem has been introduced
<BR>
in order to describe a complex system where individuals
<BR>
attempt to optimise their own satisfaction, subject to
<BR>
mutually conflicting constraints. Due to the potential
<BR>
large applicability of such model to describe all
<BR>
the situation where different objects has to be matched
<BR>
pairwise, the statistical properties of this model
<BR>
have been extensively studied. In this paper we
<BR>
present a generalization of this model,
<BR>
introduced in order to take into account the presence
<BR>
of correlations in the lists and the effects of distance
<BR>
when the *player* are supposed to be represented by a
<BR>
position in space. 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>In the *stable marriage* problem N men and N women have
<BR>
to be matched by pairs under the constraint that
<BR>
the resulting matching is stable. We study the
<BR>
statistical properties of stable matchings
<BR>
in the large N limit using both numerical
<BR>
and analytical methods. Generalizations of
<BR>
the model including *singles* and unequal
<BR>
numbers of men and women are also investigated.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>In the *stable marriage* problem, a variant of the bi-parted
<BR>
matching problem, each member has a *wish-list*
<BR>
expressing his/her preference for all possible partners;
<BR>
this list consists of random, positive real numbers
<BR>
drawn from a certain distribution. One searches the lowest
<BR>
cost for the society, at the risk of breaking up pairs
<BR>
in the course of time. Minimization of a global cost function
<BR>
(Hamiltonian) is performed with statistical mechanics
<BR>
techniques at a finite fictitious *temperature*.
<BR>
The problem is generalized to include *bachelors*,
<BR>
needed in particular when the groups have different size,
<BR>
and *polygamy*. Exact solutions are found for the optimal
<BR>
solution (T=0). The entropy is found to vanish
<BR>
quadratically in T. Whether bachelors occur or not,
<BR>
depends not only on their intrinsic *qualities*,
<BR>
or lack thereof, but also on global aspects of the chance
<BR>
for pair formation in society.
<BR>
<P>(*) Sometimes called the stable employment problem
