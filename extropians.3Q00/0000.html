<EM>&gt;No, not what you are thinking, sorry (it was too good not to post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;though):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;From sourceforge:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Singularity Engine is a specialized open-source game engine and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;toolkit designed to allow users to create platform independant games
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that can be run by any system that the engine supports. The games
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves are distributed as single files, one version of the game will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;run under any one of the engines as the actual game code is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;platform-neutral. The basic engine is actually planned to be based upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the GPLed Verge 2 game engine and the GPLed QuakeForge engine, combined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with LGPLed libraries for PNG, JPEG, MPEG video, MJPEG, Module, MIDI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Waveform, and Mpeg audio. The actual GUI game editor is written using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Gecko toolkit (MPLed) so that it will be cross platform and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extendable. We are asking that anyone interested in contributing to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Singularity engine please contact us and join the team.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Cool url too:  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/singularity/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/singularity/</A>)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;i promise that next time it's the real thing :)

<P>I'm almost sorry to see this development, as it may conflict with or compete 
<BR>
for market share with the similar Amiga object.  See amiga.com.  Ironically, 
<BR>
the first article they quote on new news is from a major gaming company that 
<BR>
is planning on using the Amiga object system exactly as you have discussed 
<BR>
above.  The Amiga object system is more general purpose - at least at 
<BR>
present, and they have major support from the really big players - Sun, Red 
<BR>
Hat, Sony, and a host of others.
<BR>
<P>Let me know, will you, how the two approaches compare...
