<EM>&gt; On the plus side, the human can recognize nuances and details and make

</EM><BR>
<P>Ah...no, the original proposal was that there be a human operator on
<BR>
the other end - and presumably one more skilled in the activity being
<BR>
done than the humbot (else, the humbot itself could just do the task
<BR>
without the expense of an operator) - thus leaving no nuances for the
<BR>
humbot to contribute.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerns that you mention would certainly have to be taken into account.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was thinking more about someone who would like to attend three different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conferences in 3 different cities at the same time, or who simply couldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make time to travel, but would still like to snoop around and check out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competition first hand.  The whole experience would be recorded, no doubt,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and several different teleoperators could tap in or take over direction.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; addition, the humbot could be given general instructions and a heads-up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; display list of priorities to check out - boothes to visit, products to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a close look at, people to watch for, so that the teleoperators could take a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; break or switch to other humbots at other locations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah.  This might be useful...but again, if the humbot is skilled enough
<BR>
to do the task, then why not just let it roam w/out operator?  (Except
<BR>
maybe for certain specific taskss, but the humbot would signal when it
<BR>
gets to those tasks; this would not be at the operator's convenience.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think that it would be fun to organize a party teleop during the Brazilian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; samba contests.  A group - or a website! - oops now I've gone and killed a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential patent...  Darn, gosh,    o'well,   could set up a teleop with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good bandwidth and do a pay-for-view, pay-more-for-control remote party.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The applications for X-sites are obvious, although they get pretty good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dedicated site coverage already, I'm sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>Taking a different spin on this...what about seating-limited events?
<BR>
(Say, a legal proceeding or a government meeting where The Powers That
<BR>
Be wish to limit public input.)  One person sits in, webcasting what's
<BR>
going on; a bunch of interested parties monitor the feed and have a chat
<BR>
session discussing what's going on.  Perhaps the person could even get
<BR>
feedback as to what to do (say, if one of the viewers thinks of a good
<BR>
retort to the Powers' &quot;respond to this complex question within five
<BR>
seconds or we'll assume our point is made&quot;); either all the parties
<BR>
could have voice input, or there could be a moderator who is the only
<BR>
one who can directly give feedback to the attendee, and gives it based
<BR>
on the chat session.
