<BR>
<P>We better have an answer to this &quot;Information wants to be free&quot; vs.
<BR>
&quot;Information creators want to eat&quot; dilemma pretty soon. Why? Because it
<BR>
is but a pale foreshadowing of what awaits us when self-replicating
<BR>
technology (nano or macro) is a reality. When the first copy of
<BR>
everything-- music albums, chairs, software, computers, designer
<BR>
bacteria, chair-factories-- is expensive to produce but subsequent
<BR>
copies are nearly free.
<BR>
<P>Two possibilities.
<BR>
<P>1. It is IMPOSSIBLE to force consumers to treat zero-marginal-cost
<BR>
merchandise the same way logistics force them to treat normal, 'bricks
<BR>
and mortar' merchandise. Willy-nilly, corporations will be forced to
<BR>
come up with revised business plans-- street performer protocol,
<BR>
selling premium access, support contracts, live gigs, smart contracts,
<BR>
advertising, and probably dozens of other possibilities they've been
<BR>
too busy suing people to think about. The discipline of the market
<BR>
guarantees that in the end, things worth doing get done-- overall
<BR>
everything will end up cheaper than it is now, and barriers to entry
<BR>
into many industries may get lowered. 
<BR>
<P>Flash-forward: I work hard for my paycheck at my 5 hour a week job, and
<BR>
spend the rest of my time fiddling with Slash version 2.0 (beta) and
<BR>
playing Emlyn's latest video game that I downloaded without incurring
<BR>
any out of pocket fees. Chances are that neither of us bothers to keep
<BR>
track anymore-- physical scarcity is a thing of the past, and the
<BR>
competition that exists between individuals is at subtler social and
<BR>
intellectual levels. There are days when I can't figure out whether I'm
<BR>
living in a Socialist utopia or a Libertarian one, but then I remember
<BR>
that Socialism and Libertarianism were brick-and-mortar ideologies that
<BR>
in their original form only have relevance as historical curiousities.
<BR>
<P><P><P>2. It is POSSIBLE to force consumers to treat zero-marginal-cost
<BR>
merchandise the same way logistics force them to treat normal, 'bricks
<BR>
and mortar' merchandise. A sweeping precedent is set for government
<BR>
intervention in the economy because how else do you -force- consumers
<BR>
to do anything? Corporations and individuals that own patents on genes
<BR>
and later (or sooner?) self-replicating machinery get rich, as do those
<BR>
with the foresight to invest in them. The unskilled workers get
<BR>
obsoleted first. The brainy consultant and management types hold on for
<BR>
a while longer but get displaced by expert systems. Normally this sort
<BR>
of disparity would naturally balance itself as the newly unemployed
<BR>
would not be able to keep the economy going with their purchases.
<BR>
However, those who own the rights to self-rep technologies no longer
<BR>
have a reason to fear recession-- they have become independent from the
<BR>
economy. &quot;Less demand? Lower the output, no sense in wasting energy.
<BR>
And build a few more security droids.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Flash-forward: In order to lower their security costs, the Aristocracy
<BR>
have acceded to giving the Obsolete handouts sufficient to prevent food
<BR>
riots. Maybe I got lucky in picking my stocks, and in this scenario am
<BR>
also living in the lap of luxury (except that I've had to give up a bit
<BR>
of privacy so that AI's versed in IP law can monitor my actions and
<BR>
insure that I'm not infringing on anybody's trademark, copyright, or
<BR>
patent). Or maybe I'm with the other 99%, living off dole payments
<BR>
supplemented by what I can find in the Aristocracy's trash cans and 
<BR>
scrupulously avoiding roving RoboCops.
