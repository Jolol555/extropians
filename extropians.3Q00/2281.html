Robin's paper (<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf</A>
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf</A>&gt;  or .ps) presents an adaptation of his
<BR>
Idea Futures proposal to government. The basic idea is that a proposed
<BR>
policy should become law if it increases expected welfare, where the welfare
<BR>
measure is determined by democratic vote, and expected effect on welfare is
<BR>
determined by the trading value of claims on what the welfare will be given
<BR>
that the proposed policy is accepted. I think the idea is very interesting
<BR>
and definitely worth exploring further.
<BR>
<P>One point that I would be interested in seeing discussed in the paper is
<BR>
whether this system of decision-making is often used in corporations, and if
<BR>
it isn't, what is the reason? Is it the case that nobody has thought of
<BR>
doing things this way before (which would be surprising, given that there
<BR>
are so many companies around involved in fierce competition, and a lot of
<BR>
people trying to think of better forms of management)? Are there legal
<BR>
prohibitions, and are they then strong enough that no company would find it
<BR>
worthwhile lobbying to get rid of them? And is that the case in every market
<BR>
economy in the world? A corporation would seem to provide a nice prototype
<BR>
test-bed for this approach, so it would be interesting to know whether the
<BR>
experiment has already taken place in &quot;nature&quot;, and if so, what the outcome
<BR>
is. (Or if this is really novel, would it be possible for Robin to get a
<BR>
patent on it?)
<BR>
<P>BTW, a faint reflection of this approach can be found in Geoffrey Moores'
<BR>
recent book &quot;Living on the Fault Line&quot; (which Max mentioned here recently).
<BR>
Moore argues that managers of companies in emerging markets should pay more
<BR>
attention to market cap and less to earnings and sales figures. Management
<BR>
should try to guess how different actions might affect their current stock
<BR>
value - which is speculators' way of specifying the expected future
<BR>
&quot;welfare&quot; of the company. So maybe futarchy is brand new stuff for the
<BR>
corporate world after all?
<BR>
<P>On a smaller point: Robin says (p. 29) that one should not require markets
<BR>
to agree on a proposal for too long a period before it can be officially
<BR>
approved, because &quot;Otherwise speculators early in the period may worry that
<BR>
speculators later in the period will know substantially more, and bias their
<BR>
estimates thereby.&quot; It's not clear to me why this would be a problem, or
<BR>
what the bias referred to would be.
