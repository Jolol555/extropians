<EM>&gt; To continue my earlier message, like Robert Coyote, I use the term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;spiritual&quot; for want of something better, but I'm having second thoughts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about this, because of the religious undertones the word carries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Yes, that was the main thrust of my earlier post. The term &quot;spiritual&quot;,
<BR>
taken at face value, refers to qualities of the *spirit*; a term that
<BR>
definitely has connotations one might want to refrain from making,
<BR>
especially in a forum such as this. However, with the appropriate
<BR>
caveats and qualifiers, the word might be used successfully as a synonym
<BR>
for the other feelings that I mentioned. In my opinion though, its use
<BR>
seems somewhat ill-considered.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I have referred to as &quot;spiritual&quot; are connections (for want of a better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; word) which seem to occur between two or more entities outside the realm of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; present scientific explanation.  I do not mean to imply that these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connections are supernatural or they will never be explained scientifically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To the contrary, I fully expect that they will.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Would you consider the environment/surroundings as an 'entity'? Perhaps
<BR>
you could elaborate on your use of connection? I'm perfectly willing to
<BR>
accept an explanation that simply involves an ineffable feeling that
<BR>
there is something binding you and the perceived.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For now, though, they're just THERE, like the placebo effect and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomenon of record breaking in sports. IMO, the compulsion to deny these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomena simply because there's no explanation for them is, in its own way,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as intellectually limiting as religion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I don't think anyone was denying the phenomena exist. At least for me, I
<BR>
was questioning the appropriate usage of the word when it seems others
<BR>
are available that do a better job at representing what you are
<BR>
experiencing.
<BR>
<P>All in the interest of (hopefully) better communication.
