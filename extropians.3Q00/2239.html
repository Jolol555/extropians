<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Huh?  If humans allow the creation of nanotech with insufficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error-correction-codes (ECC) in designs/programs to allow this to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occur, then they get what they deserve.
</EM><BR>
<P>ECC is unsatisfactory as a control mechanism.  What's needed is
<BR>
nanomachines that just *die* when a single bit flips, not nanomachines
<BR>
that attempt to correct the error.
<BR>
<P>I also worry about prions - i.e. a deformation of a motor arm that
<BR>
results in the manufacture of nanomachines with a similar deformation. 
<BR>
This is evolution of a sort, and it can proceed without a single
<BR>
informational error in the assembly instructions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Blech, Phooey.  All you have to have done is existed for a few million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years longer than humans and developed slow-pokey world ships to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colonized the galaxy.  It doesn't take nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P>Valid objection - since the Fermi Paradox applies to lightsails and
<BR>
generation ships, it cannot be used to disprove the existence of higher
<BR>
technologies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Furthermore, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;nanobot&quot; colonization perspective indicates that he clearly does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand the possible problems that nanomachinery has with the high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; radiation fluxes encountered in space.
</EM><BR>
<P>Invalid objection.  While nanosystems of the sophistication described in
<BR>
_Nanosystems_ might keel over and die faced with high radiation fluxes,
<BR>
ultra-sophisticated nanotech of the type produced by a human
<BR>
civilization possessed of matter compilers for centuries or millennia
<BR>
should be far more tolerant of radiation than biology, or possibly even
<BR>
sheet metal, since sheet metal isn't self-repairing.
<BR>
<P>Besides which, nanomachinery has fewer problems with radiation than you
<BR>
might think.  I seem to recall certain individuals on this list telling
<BR>
me that nanonukes were impossible because of the radiation; well, I met
<BR>
Robert Freitas at the Spring 2000 Gathering and he said that was a load
<BR>
of hooey (paraphrasing liberally, here - what he actually said is that
<BR>
nanomachines could perform isotope separation on uranium without any
<BR>
difficulty, and in fact would be one of the most efficient means of
<BR>
doing so).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;... we are driven toward concluding that (a) there is no other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intelligent life in the galaxy or (b) non-organic nanotechnology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the self-replicating micro-Babbage-robot type described by Drexler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is impossible.  Since we know that the evolution of intelligent life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is posssible, but we do not know that nanotechnology is, I must consider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (b) the more likely alternative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great!  Using the Fermi Paradox to explain why nanotechnology is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impossible.  Now I've seen everything!  Could there not be a (c)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Nanotech civilizations can observe almost everything, so there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no need to travel&quot;, or (d) &quot;Nanotech civilizations spend their time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to engineer smaller selves.  They do not interact with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pre-limts-of-physics species.&quot; etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, (c) and (d) are as silly as (a) and (b).  Nobody has ever given a
<BR>
satisfactory explanation of the Fermi Paradox.  That's why it's a
<BR>
Paradox.  All such a Paradox can prove is that a given picture of the
<BR>
Universe is incomplete; it cannot be used to disprove specific facets of
<BR>
a scenario.
