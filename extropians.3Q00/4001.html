<P>
We need to be careful here as there are two arguments running which are intricately
<BR>
intertwined - intellectual property, and the sovereignty of the individual.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A corporate CEO, chairman, or president is held accountable by the board of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directors (i.e. congress) who themselves are held accountable by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stockholders (the body of voters).
</EM><BR>
<P>So you are supporting a 'republic' system of governance, where a single person makes
<BR>
decisions everyday over others with the ever so fragile perception of the voter who is
<BR>
allowed an either/or vote once every 1,4 or 6 years and where ultimately he with the most
<BR>
money wins?  If so, you've already made my point.  If not, then:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If a corporation is a dictatorship, then so is every 'democratic' society that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever existed, and there is no such thing as democracy.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're right there is no such thing as a democracy - yet!   I challenge you to show me a
<BR>
single form of governance larger than 100,000 people that has ever been run as a true
<BR>
democracy.  The moment you 'elect' somebody to 'represent' you as in the U.S. or your
<BR>
typical corporation, you have at best a *republic* system of government.  At least with
<BR>
the current government you have the pretense of one person, one vote.  But in
<BR>
corporations, he with the most stock makes the rules.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; An employee has the choice whether or not to be a voter, by buying stock, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as every citizen of a democratic country is free to choose whether or not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vote. Is the elected president of a country a dictator simply because some part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the population decides not to vote?
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, the moment you put an 'alpha' in charge, regardless of how they got there, is no
<BR>
longer a democracy assuming it was one to begin with.  And besides what you seem to be
<BR>
advocating is not only putting various alpha's in charge but worse in that we are only
<BR>
allowed to decide between a few hand picked alpha's every 2,4 or 6 years.  They on the
<BR>
other hand get to decide how we live our lives every hour of every day they remain in
<BR>
charge.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No. What you seem to want is a mobocracy, where total democracy reigns, and the rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of no individual is beyond elimination by a simple vote of the majority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or even a vote of x number of people who want to do something, which would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lynchocracy). Sorry, we are not that sort of society. The majority is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constrained by the rights of the individual that are protected by supermajority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limitations. Don't like it? Go elsewhere if you want to steal other people's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hardly!  You are obviously missing the entire point of my argument. By the way, what
<BR>
individuals are you talking about?  Oh, I'm sorry you must be thinking of corporations as
<BR>
individuals or perhaps those individuals who are majority stockholders, or CEO's, or
<BR>
record executives? Well, they don't give a damn about me, so why should I give a damn
<BR>
about them?  Luckily I do give a damn about them as individuals as long as their rights
<BR>
don't involve stepping on mine.  I already paid them a royalty when I purchased the song
<BR>
the first time in 8-track or LP.  Now that I grab a digital copy of it I'm a thief?
<BR>
<P>As for the oxymoronic intellectual property meme, the idea that you can lock up
<BR>
information which by its nature can be duplicated endlessly with little or no cost, is
<BR>
nothing less the the enforcement of *artificial scarcity*.  That makes them thieves!  I've
<BR>
said it before and I'll say it again, enforcing artificial scarcity by extending
<BR>
intellectual property protections beyond a reasonable time period is theft of the commons.
<BR>
<P>Besides, it was the invention of recordable media that allowed them to make any money in
<BR>
the first place.  So now that technology changes the rules all over again, we have to
<BR>
enforce artificial scarcity to maintain their money stream?  I'm sorry, but I'm not buying
<BR>
it.  It seems obvious to me that you have not read Stallman 'Right to Read' link I
<BR>
provided, otherwise you would have responded to the very compelling arguments it makes
<BR>
about the ultimate tyranny of fictional 'intellectual' property rights. And before we
<BR>
forget, the original intent of copyright law was to permit individuals a limited time
<BR>
monopoly as a further incentive to continue creating.  Now that powerful corporations have
<BR>
managed to extend such protections indefinitely has effectively eliminated fair use and is
<BR>
a despicable development that could seriously squelch the free flow of ideas.
<BR>
<P>Unless I've misread you, what you seem to be advocating is that the legal construct known
<BR>
as a corporation should always be given precedence over the rights of individuals. I on
<BR>
the other hand am advocating an individualocracy, not a mobocracy or a lynchocracy as you
<BR>
think. What is individualocracy? Consider it the ultimate bottom-up approach to politics,
<BR>
where the sovereignty of the individual takes precedence over the community, which in turn
<BR>
takes precedence over that of the county, or state, which in turn takes precedence over
<BR>
that of the federal government or large corporation. Call me a 10th amendment extremist.
<BR>
What kind of society would develop because of this is anyone's guess.  One thing is
<BR>
certain it would be a lot more decentralized and free than what we have now.  Want to
<BR>
smoke pot and have public sex? Well luckily for you in this forthcoming individualocracy
<BR>
those who agree with you will be forming communities to do just that.
