<P><EM>&gt; Jumping in here, has anyone really defined for certain what a useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;AI&quot; would be, and how it would differ, exactly, from any other piece of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software?
</EM><BR>
<P>You do *not* need classical AI.  Someone (at the Foresight or Contact
<BR>
Conference???) observed that the interesting thing about AI is that
<BR>
once you figure out how to do something using an algorithm or collection
<BR>
of ad-hoc knowledge and decisions people stop calling it &quot;AI&quot;.
<BR>
Remember when you had to have &quot;AI&quot; to play chess or drive a car?
<BR>
<P>What you need is matter compilers and design verifcation tools and a huge
<BR>
library of molecular &quot;parts&quot;.  Think of every type of mechanical thingy
<BR>
in the macro-scale world (wheels, gears, beams, axles, pipes, pumps,
<BR>
motors, conductors, lights, speakers, etc.) and now imagine all of those
<BR>
constructed out of a few hundred thousand to a few million atoms.
<BR>
That is why I think Nano@home using random atomic fill-in with human
<BR>
semi-intelligent (human?) assisted &quot;selection&quot; is an interesting way to go.
<BR>
<P>If you have all the parts pre-designed and tested, then a pretty decent
<BR>
&quot;Hardware-Description-Language&quot; and some tools similar to those now
<BR>
used in the semiconductor industry would let you ramp Nano pretty fast.
<BR>
<P>However, considering how long it took the semiconductor industry to
<BR>
develop these things, you can see it isn't going to happen quickly
<BR>
unless there is some breakthrough in software development times.
<BR>
<P>(As an aside, people always gripe about how long it takes to write
<BR>
softare -- if you view what we are doing as a process of replicating
<BR>
what nature has done (creating intelligent self-conscious entities)
<BR>
then we are doing it about a million times faster.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nano theorists and nano doubters alike seem to enjoy talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about AI's, but maybe all you really need is just some very fancy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software to do the &quot;automated molecular skyscrapers&quot; from simple feed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stock material.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with this.  The only somewhat fuzzy AI required in my mind
<BR>
is the part where you need to verify that someone isn't &quot;sneaking&quot;
<BR>
through parts in separate designs, that can be subsequently harvested
<BR>
and used to build something dangerous.  I think Eric has suggested
<BR>
that at least some designs may need to assembled in such a way that
<BR>
they break themselves or meltdown if attempts are made to disassemble them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Really, though, is there an implicit assumption that &quot;compiler&quot; software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is at a standstill -- so therefore you need a &quot;Max Headroom&quot; AI before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can successfully automate some range of constructions?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I think anyone who thinks Nanotech requires AI hasn't thought it
<BR>
through very well.  Biotech is a limited subset of Nanotech and we have
<BR>
the genetic programs (operating systems) and are slowly working our way
<BR>
through understanding the complete toolkits bio-organisms use for
<BR>
self-construction and we haven't had to use very much &quot;A&quot; in the &quot;I&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; From Robin (???):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I disagree that you need advanced nanotech to upload.  It all depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; just how detailed information you need on neurons and synapses.  And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could well be worth spending billions of dollars to scan just one brain,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; given how much money could be made from copies of that one brain.   We didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; need advanced nanotech to read the human genome -- because it was worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enough to read just one genome.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Er, wait a minute! You're going to get detailed info on about a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quadrillion brain synapses, and you're going to do that without advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech?
</EM><BR>
<P>You can imagine a destructive readout approach with nothing more than
<BR>
extremely very fine tissue slicers combined with near field microscopy
<BR>
or electron microscopy that can &quot;read&quot; all of the synaptic interconnect
<BR>
pathways in the brain.  If this encodes all of our &quot;intelligence&quot;, then
<BR>
this will let you reproduce yourself.  In my mind this isn't an &quot;upload&quot;
<BR>
but a &quot;copyload&quot;.  If however there is interconnect or synapse weighting
<BR>
information in the density and type of neurotransmitters in the synapses
<BR>
then the readout is going to require the application of a lot of antibodies
<BR>
or other neurotransmitter identifiction &amp; quantification molecules and
<BR>
that is probably beyond current technology.  It might be feasible in
<BR>
ten or so years once we have X-ray/NMR based models for all of the molecules
<BR>
we need to &quot;feel&quot; and fancy computers like Blue Gene that would let
<BR>
us accurately design complementary sensing molecules.
<BR>
<P>My guess though is that that type of readout would be quite slow and
<BR>
very expensive.
<BR>
<P>Regarding the quantity of information.  You have ~60 Billion neurons,
<BR>
so 6x10^10 * 10^3 synapses/neuron = 6x10^13 synaptic connections
<BR>
(10 trillion).  Assume you need source &amp; destination address
<BR>
information (~40 bits each unless you do some interesting local
<BR>
address compression) and some strength of connection information (4 bits?)
<BR>
and that works out to 5 Terabytes of information just to store the
<BR>
brain map -- without even trying to execute the simulation.
<BR>
<P>If that is accurate, you will be able to store it on a single disk
<BR>
drive by 2007 (assuming current density doubling/year continues).
<BR>
Getting it into main memory (processor in memory) will probably be
<BR>
circa 2010-2015.  Even then it is going to be a pretty sizable computer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Suddenly, I envisage the subject for this with a whole forest of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chemical analysis pipettes sticking out of his skull (to say the least)!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As you indicate, one might be able to skip *some* of that &quot;quadrillion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synapses&quot;. But, even if you need, say &quot;only a trillion&quot; sensors, how do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you do that with any ordinary tech?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Robin is a fan of &quot;copyload&quot; even if destructive readout is
<BR>
required (Robin please correct me if that is an incorrect assumption).
<BR>
(You have to remember, he's the author of the theory that the person
<BR>
who gets to the playhouse first gets to monopolize all the toys... :-)).
<BR>
<P>I probably prefer more of a gradual evolutionary &quot;upload&quot; process over many
<BR>
years.  I'd bet David prefers this as well.  The &quot;copyload&quot; process can probably
<BR>
be done without &quot;real&quot; nanotech.  The &quot;evoload&quot; process probably requires
<BR>
long term, real time monitoring and that would require either *very*
<BR>
advanced biotech or real med-nano-tech.
