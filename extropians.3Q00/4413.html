<EM>&gt; &gt; 	but then aren't we enslaved by &quot;the best&quot;? enslaved by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very condition of our being?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	How can one consider knowing, absolutely, what is best, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absolutely and deterministically always being able to chose and get it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as &quot;enslaved&quot;?  One cannot chose, that which he does not want, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes no logical sense.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word i focus on is &quot;deterministiclly.&quot; what you describe is by
<BR>
no means an unattractive way to be, but it didn't remind me of what &quot;free
<BR>
will&quot; is traditionally taken to mean. on the other hand, you did provide
<BR>
your own definition of the term ... my fault, i guess.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most human beings want sex, yet many feel enslaved by this desire. &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Of course, now we're branching out to something a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different.  Our creator (evolution I believe) has hard wired powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sexual joys to the stimulus of sexual behavior.  In other words, if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do certain sexual acts, we receive the reward of phenomenal sexual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pleasure.  Of course, having some puppet master besides ourselves hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wire such strings isn't free agency at all.  Only when we can cut and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rewire such strings, such that we can want what we want to want, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rewire ourselves to receive phenomenal joys for the stimulus which we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choose, can one truly be free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the phrase that captures me here is &quot;want what we want to want.&quot;
<BR>
perhaps we can choose that which we do not (that is, not at the present) 
<BR>
want, after all. of course, this is only a word game ... which was part of
<BR>
my initial point. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Won't it be great when we can make undesirable things like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paper work (or anything else we'd like to do but now hate doing) be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orgasmick or better?  ;) Now that'll be true freedom!  Imagine how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much we'll all get done with such abilities to want what we want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want, and not what our creator hard wired us to want!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	Still, anything that makes us deviate from that which we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really want, even if it is hard wired pleasures, it destroys ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom and makes them a slave to whatever is causing them to deviate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from choosing and getting what they really want right!?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm with you here ... from an emotional pov anyway.
