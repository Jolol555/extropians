<EM>&gt; &gt; The waist/hip ratio might be one of those things

<EM>&gt; I may have an explanation for this.  Surely sexual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preferences are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard wired in our brains, by some mysterious means. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Isnt it curious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that in general men prefer women who are thinner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woman, but women prefer men who are closer to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average man?

<P>Coincidentally, TLC had a program tonight called the
<BR>
Science of Sex with appearances from Dr. Fisher and
<BR>
Dr. Buss (major evolutionary psychologists). It was
<BR>
noted that the coke bottle shape, waist to hip ratio
<BR>
most desired is .67 and that today's most desired
<BR>
women have that ratio but so did Marilyn Monroe. They
<BR>
said something about how women with a certain % of fat
<BR>
around the hips/buttocks in ratio to the waist was
<BR>
perceived as good child-bearing stock.  They also
<BR>
mentioned research with tribes that have not been
<BR>
exposed to Madison Avenue hype and found that the same
<BR>
.67 ratio was observed to be most desirable.
<BR>
<P>They also said something about how the U of New Mexico
<BR>
had run a study of preferences and had derived the
<BR>
perfect female face.  Gotta admit, even though she
<BR>
doesn't exist, she is a hottie! They talked about how
<BR>
Paul Newman has an almost perfect face with the
<BR>
symmetry and the jaw and eyebrows.  Clinton was also
<BR>
noted as having unusually symmetrical facial features.
<BR>
<P>I couldn't find when it's going to be on again but it
<BR>
was good television.
