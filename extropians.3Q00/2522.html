<P>
&quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; says:
<BR>
...&gt; 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; MS-DOS is effectively freeware as well, under similar circumstances. In both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cases, my selling 'official' MS versions with included support is illegal, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as it is illegal for me to sell 'official' RedHat distros that include support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are trapped in the hacker mindset that everyone is an expert, when they most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly are not. A non-official distro is useless to a non-expert, which means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its useless to most people.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>That may be true, but it does not mean that it's not useful to a fine
<BR>
market - the experts who need media.  It might also be useful to
<BR>
plenty of people in poorer countries, where every dollar counts more.
<BR>
This may be a major factor driving Linux in the future -- companies,
<BR>
ISPs, colleges, and high schools in India and China who will buy one
<BR>
CD to install on dozens and dozens of PC's, rather than having to pay
<BR>
hundreds of dollars for each seat.  This can lower the cost of a PC by
<BR>
as much as 10 - 30 % depending on the cost of the alternative
<BR>
commercial OS.
<BR>
<P>It is also definitely true that having to pay only once for support
<BR>
(which is what you're really buying from Red Hat) is vastly cheaper
<BR>
for a small company than having to pay for each desk's installation of
<BR>
the OS.
<BR>
<P>A small company could buy one CD, copy it to each of, say 10 desks,
<BR>
and then have one designated tech guy call up and get support for any
<BR>
problems that anyone in the company experiences.  This is vastly
<BR>
cheaper than $40 x 10 and an excellent deal for the small company.  
<BR>
<P>Rather than a good or bad way of doing things, I think of this as a
<BR>
different market niche.  In my opinion there's no inherent moral
<BR>
superiority to one or another way of doing things, though I personally
<BR>
enjoy the freedom that free software gives and therefore enjoy using
<BR>
it more.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
James
