<EM>&gt; If insurance were truly a fair bet, it would account for my healthy state in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; premiums. That it doesn't indicates that its a scam. Yes, shit does happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However there are people that shit tends not to happen to. Insurance forms, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, do not ask the ages or dates of birth and death of your ancestors, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they totally leave out any possibility for people with healthy and long lived
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genomes to realize benefits from their natural state. Insurance policies also do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not account for your past health history. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it is unfortunate that insurance companies are often prevented from
<BR>
discriminating more than they do, and that does make the bet more unfair.
<BR>
They are allowed to account for some things: smoking, hazardous jobs,
<BR>
history of heart disease, diabetes, and other things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some on the list will say I'm not following the social contract, blah blah blah.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The social contract is typically a piece of paper they hold over your eyes while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are going for your wallet.
</EM><BR>
<P>No argument here.  But sometimes you /still/ want to hedge, even though
<BR>
you know the odds are bad.  Here's an example from my experience: I once
<BR>
had an 8-game football parlay ticket that I bought on a whim (I don't
<BR>
normally bet sports--I much prefer to bet on my own talents at the poker
<BR>
table).  7 wins later, I had a ticket that would be worth over $10,000 if
<BR>
the Broncos won a certain game, and nothing if they didn't.  The highest
<BR>
expectation thing for me to do, of course, is to just ride it out (and
<BR>
the Broncos were favored by 3).  But I chose instead to take the sure
<BR>
thing by buying a $5,000 ticket on the Broncos to lose the same game.
<BR>
So now I get $5,000 no matter who won, but I paid another 9% house rake
<BR>
for the privilege, and gave up the chance at $10,000.  Sure, it was a
<BR>
bad bet overall, but it was still a reasonable thing to do at the time.
<BR>
