<EM>&gt;On the other hand, I've been reading up on the Church of Scientology in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the past week or so -- research for a project -- and came across this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fun web page:

<EM>&gt;I'd like to urge any Extropians who don't know anything about the Co$ to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;read as much of it as they can stomach. It's a dictionary.  It defines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;referents within a language: concepts and terms used internally within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Church. I don't think it's a fake. And I don't think I'm exaggerating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much if I state that trying to put myself inside the mind of someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who thinks in these terms gives me the same queasy sensation I get when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I try to understand Nazism........

The peculiar epistemology used by Hubbard involved long, long lists of 
<BR>
definitions of terms - defined very differently than their common usage.  A 
<BR>
couple of decades ago, I picked up a set of Hubbard's &quot;serious&quot; works at 
<BR>
some garage sale, and took a look at how he thought.  My impression was that 
<BR>
the definitions and concepts he used were themselves part of the programming 
<BR>
that scientologists receive, and that none of it was accidental.
<BR>
<P>A normal definition, as we non-scientologists use the term, consists of a 
<BR>
super-set - say &quot;animal&quot; - and then the criteria which distinguishes the 
<BR>
subset named from other members of the superset - as in &quot;rational&quot; for the 
<BR>
term human - &quot;a rational animal.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Hubbard's definitions, as I recall, were more of the form: &quot;human&quot; - &quot;an 
<BR>
unaware Thetan,&quot; altho I just made up that particular example.  Like a nazi 
<BR>
defining a Jew, not by the religious heritage, but as &quot;a subhuman enemy of 
<BR>
all humanity,&quot; Hubbard included his personal opinions and evaluations in the 
<BR>
definitions and often used them as the essential defining characteristics of 
<BR>
a term.  I do recall that I was impressed that many of his definitions did 
<BR>
seem to strike at a core of meaning that Websters would not consider, but 
<BR>
that still leaves the problem of the many that appeared to be simply 
<BR>
imposing an evaluation.
<BR>
<P>Thus, a philosophically naive person, thru his or her willingness to accept 
<BR>
such nonsense as part of the &quot;training,&quot; could easilly lose all grip on 
<BR>
reality as we know it, at least on a cognitive level.  Out of consistency, 
<BR>
they would feel obligated to act in accordence with the conclusions that 
<BR>
would follow, once having accepted the epistemology and the conceptual set - 
<BR>
however bizarre those conclusions might be.
