<EM>&gt; I'll grant this as a possibility, but counter than many people seem way

<EM>&gt; too quick to assume that open source will take over.  It is now only a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small part of software, and an even smaller part of the other industries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mentioned, many of which have been around a lot longer.

<P>I'm biased, because I'm an open source developer (even if only in
<BR>
a small way). However, I wouldn't call 30% of the server market small!
<BR>
Open source is also making in-roads in embedded systems. While most of
<BR>
the software people _see_ is on their desktop running Windows, it's by
<BR>
no means the largest chunk of the market; if nothing else, ponder what
<BR>
your cash registers or car engine management systems or web servers
<BR>
are running. We're now witnessing IBM getting evangelical about Linux,
<BR>
as in combination with Java it offers a route to the sort of convergence
<BR>
that SNA, OS/2 and so on were intended to bring about in the late 1980's
<BR>
(with all of their platforms interoperating and talking to each other).
<BR>
<P>The thing is, we don't know where open source is going. We can see is
<BR>
that it's come a very long way in the past decade; but looking back at,
<BR>
say, the state of Linux, sendmail, and BIND in 1992 doesn't give us any
<BR>
obvious pointers to the state of Linux, sendmail, and BIND in 2000.
<BR>
Indeed, extrapolating those products from 1992 would give us a misleading
<BR>
impression of what 2000 would be like.
<BR>
<P>The open source thing may sputter and fade, but then again, in fifty
<BR>
years time we may look back on the commercial software industry as an
<BR>
aberration that could only have existed during a period of extremely
<BR>
rapid growth, new market development, and massive customer ignorance.
<BR>
If it doesn't fizzle, then a whole new model for understanding how
<BR>
resources are allocated under conditions of plenty will have emerged.
<BR>
<P>Or, to put it another way: our relationship to physical commodities is
<BR>
determined by how easy it is to get more of them. As an open source guy,
<BR>
I don't worry about buying software or paying license fees: I float in a
<BR>
sea of the stuff, use whatever I need, and sometimes when my conscience
<BR>
troubles me I give something extra back. 
<BR>
<P>If nanotech designs work the same way ... we won't eliminate heavy
<BR>
industry or big manufacturing companies: some enterprises will _always_
<BR>
be needed to tackle projects where the risk of failure is such that
<BR>
accountability is required -- airliners, for example, or the software
<BR>
controlling radiation machines for cancer treatment.
<BR>
<P>But a lot of other types of enterprise will show up as concentrations
<BR>
of power that don't actually add value to the new economy -- companies
<BR>
who make and sell mass-produced desks, for example, or web browsers or
<BR>
word processing software. These are essentially technologies that are
<BR>
mature enough that teams of volunteers can produce effective, usable
<BR>
designs (I'm thinking, for example, of the Konqueror web browser),
<BR>
and where there's no critical requirement for accountability and 
<BR>
auditing because their use or misuse isn't life-threatening.
<BR>
<P>I'm not quite sure where the whole thing is going, but a wholesale
<BR>
redefinition of our idea of what constitutes &quot;added value&quot; in consumer
<BR>
goods is going to be part of it. Which suggests to me that our
<BR>
working definitions of, say, capitalism (or socialism!) are going to
<BR>
mutate considerably in the post-nanotech era.
