I believe there are lots of these phenomena that occur. Now the question is how useful are they? I reflect hat the recent development with FTL experiments were deemed repeatable, although insignificant, since the propagation of photons through cesium atoms create the illusion of FTL-apparent FTL. Is &quot;psychic&quot; phenomena merely the &quot;presistent&quot; illusion of the human species? I recall that Hans Morevec speculated that perhaps, consciousness does not end at physical death, but instead transfers to the next &quot;universe&quot; where it can survive? Perhaps as a intereference pattern in a purely psychological universe? Oh well lunch is over, back to work.

and the person I was speaking with immediately began talking about his

own psychic experiences.

<P>The experiences range from the trivial (e.g. seeing the same elderly

hours-long tale of poltergeist experiences including exploding glassware

and visions of dead people). None of them were described as controllable

or repeatable.
