<EM>&gt; Artifically induced market conditions, you ought to say, since at least 1/3 of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the US is under the ownership of the federal and state governments, where no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development is allowed. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Of course, federal ownership is not evenly distributed.  In most western
<BR>
states, 75+% of the land is owned by the feds.  In Nevada, where I have
<BR>
most of my real estate interests, 87% of the state is controlled by the
<BR>
federal government.  At this level of federal ownership, most real estate
<BR>
becomes effectively undevelopable.  Dense urbanization is inevitable if
<BR>
for no other reason than it is being forced on the populace by the
<BR>
destruction of the economic network that is created by adjoining real
<BR>
estate parcels in less developed regions.
<BR>
<P>A lot of people don't even consider the damage caused by Federal land
<BR>
purchases in terms of network effects with respect to parcel boundaries,
<BR>
yet if you look at maps of federal land acquisitions, it appears that the
<BR>
feds are well aware of what they are doing, leveraging small purchases to
<BR>
control vast regions.  In most western states, the Federal government does
<BR>
not acquire large contiguous blocks of land.  Instead they purchase dozens
<BR>
or hundreds of small parcels (small means anywhere from a couple acres to
<BR>
a few hundred) in a random shotgun pattern across a region.  What
<BR>
eventually happens is that in states that have a high percentage of
<BR>
federal land ownership, almost every parcel not already in a town or city
<BR>
has federal land on at least 3 sides and typically all 4 sides.  In many
<BR>
places in Idaho and Nevada for example, privately owned parcels are
<BR>
separated by a mile or more of federal land on all sides.  You can't
<BR>
give these parcels away, it devalues the land so much to be
<BR>
surrounded by federal land.  Having federal land on even one boundary can
<BR>
be a problem, as they can effectively impose an arbitrary number of
<BR>
restrictions on land use that is even proximal to federally controlled
<BR>
land.
<BR>
<P>Since the federal government never gives up land, it becomes effectively
<BR>
impossible to develop regions, as the federal government strictly limits
<BR>
use and access of federal land in these areas and the individual parcels
<BR>
are not big enough to be developable in their own right.  The net effect
<BR>
is that the scattered privately owned parcels become nearly useless, as
<BR>
even getting federal permission to put in a dirt road to individual parcels
<BR>
is a herculean undertaking on its own and can be flat out denied a fair
<BR>
percentage of the time.  Also, in order to expand the borders of towns
<BR>
(which are usually surrounded by federal land in places like Nevada), the
<BR>
feds will only give surrounding parcels to the state in exchange for much
<BR>
larger parcels elsewhere.  In states that are growing very rapidly in
<BR>
population, such as Nevada (5% annually), you see the federal government
<BR>
acquiring an even larger percentage of the state by forcing uneven trades
<BR>
so that the economy of the state can expand.  Eventually, almost all
<BR>
privately owned land in the western states will be isolated to existing
<BR>
metropolitan areas.  Many smaller towns, on the other hand, are
<BR>
evaporating and will continue to do so.
<BR>
<P>The long-term ramifications are unclear, other than the apparently forced
<BR>
urbanization of most of the western states, and the country at large.  The
<BR>
biggest potential impact on the country is the increasing restrictions on
<BR>
mining near (which is effectively everywhere) or on federally controlled
<BR>
land in the Great Basin region.  Almost half of U.S. mining and mineral
<BR>
extraction (mostly heavy metals and industrial minerals) occurs in this
<BR>
region, and accounts for 6% of the world's metal production.  Also, some
<BR>
of the heavy metals produced almost exclusively in this region, such as
<BR>
gold, are among the only export metals the U.S. produces; most domestic
<BR>
metal consumption is augmented by imports to meet demand.
<BR>
<P>I wandered a bit, but my point is that current government land
<BR>
acquisitions will eventually force virtually the entire population into
<BR>
densely packed metropolitan areas, with its attendant issues and problems.
<BR>
And with the current trend in &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;
<BR>
regulation of these lands, the U.S. may become even more dependent on
<BR>
resource imports than it already is, as domestic resources go
<BR>
underutilized.  Actually, the first resource that will create a stink will
<BR>
probably be water.  Most urban areas import their water; on the west coast
<BR>
of the U.S., almost all of it comes from aquifers and resevoirs in the
<BR>
rural western regions.  If some organizations get their way (and it
<BR>
appears that they may), the importation of water into places like
<BR>
California may be strongly curtailed.
