<EM>&gt; Ah--then YOU can tell me where to find an incandescent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that won't burnout for a decade or so..? I know they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exist, but they're understandably unpopular amongst
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lightbulb-makers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I will look things up to see the best suppliers, but here are some
<BR>
offhand comments:
<BR>
<P>a) if you are running 110-120 vac, use an incandescent bulb rated for
<BR>
135 volts or higher. The light produced won't be as 'white', but it WILL
<BR>
last a long time. Manufacturers won't tell you about this, because the
<BR>
want to keep selling you bulbs, but this is the secret of the '30 year
<BR>
bulb'. Long life incandescent bulbs are long lived because they have fat
<BR>
tungsten filaments, which consequently consume lots of power for the
<BR>
amount of light they produce.
<BR>
b) you can buy good full spectrum tri-phosphor compact fluorescent lamps
<BR>
with electronic ballasts built in (some are even dimmable) that use
<BR>
about 40% of the energy of an incandescent lamp, and last for 3-7 years,
<BR>
based on actual hours used per year. These come built into a globular
<BR>
diffuser to simulate a normal bulb. Sylvania makes the best of these.
<BR>
c) There are also bulbs that have clusters of LEDs built into them which
<BR>
are even more efficient than fluorescent, typically using less than 20%
<BR>
of the energy of a comparative incandescent bulb. I will look up makers
<BR>
of these devices for you. 
<BR>
<P>I'm not in the energy efficiency business anymore, so I have not kept up
<BR>
much...
