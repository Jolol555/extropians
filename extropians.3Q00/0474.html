[Non-member submission]
<BR>
<P>Dear all,
<BR>
<P>One of my recent research interests is philosophy surrounding the digital
<BR>
society and sentient beings - no doubt I still have much to learn - I am
<BR>
trying to cover appropriate reference points on the web, and wonder whether
<BR>
others can help by suggesting places to look.
<BR>
<P>For instance, I include cryptography/cypherpunks/digital_rights/zks/eff and
<BR>
the implementation of 'ethics' in digital media (the relationships between
<BR>
the society/individual as they were encoded in laws and ways of acting are
<BR>
now encoded in cryptographic protocols), and
<BR>
transhumanist/extropianism/futures/etc (mans spiritual quest and the birth
<BR>
of the meme species satisfied through technical augmentation and navigation
<BR>
towards the future including the unity of knowledge and wisdom in the
<BR>
singularity), molecularmanufacturing/nanotech/etc (the post-industrial
<BR>
economy where man has mastered the next layer of physical production is on
<BR>
the roadmap towards mans continuing mastery over reality, etc) and
<BR>
futures/foresight/etc (investigating, predicting and shaping the
<BR>
possibilities of the future).
<BR>
<P>Would anyone be so kind as to offer suggestions beyond the above ? Mailing
<BR>
lists, major web sites, etc. If I don't get a chance to make a web page in
<BR>
the future, I will at least return a summary of answers back to the list.
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Matthew Gream
<BR>
<P>(btw: have you read about the web browser that has been constructed for
<BR>
animals - soon the digital collective consciousness may link all sentient
<BR>
beings together, and we won't be able to tell the parrots from the script
<BR>
kiddies! --- the internet is truly a collective consciousness and a medium
<BR>
for interspecies communication and interaction!)
