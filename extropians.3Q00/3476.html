<EM>&gt;      &gt; It seems far from clear to me that it is trivial to take a design for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; bridge, throw some nanodust at it and say &quot;Build it for me over there.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; Assembly  and construction use intelligence, just as design does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About 5 years ago I listed 6 reasons why a macroscopic assembler, like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person on a assembly line, was doing a far more difficult task that requires much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more brain power than a Nanotechnology assembler ever would. I still think it's true,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it wasn't biology wouldn't exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>While it may seem belated, I'm inspired today to comment on John Clark's
<BR>
&quot;6 reasons for nanotech to work more easily than macrotech&quot;:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) The parts a macroscopic assembler uses would be very expensive, the parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    that Nanotechnology uses, atoms, are very cheap.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a really good point, and a major reason to expect good economy
<BR>
from nanomanufacturing. However, one has to be just a little bit
<BR>
cautious about the idea of replicating things from cheap atoms. For
<BR>
instance, to get a useful feed stock for nanofactories you'd have to
<BR>
purify some sort of construction material, a material such as an
<BR>
alcohol, for instance. Uncontrolled impurities could &quot;poison&quot; your
<BR>
construction machines, bonding with things in such a way as to spoil
<BR>
your project. Also, people love to talk about mining incredibly diluted
<BR>
elements (like gold) from sea water. However, if you have to concentrate
<BR>
things too much, the energy cost may be worth more than the market value
<BR>
of what you've mined, even with the help of nano-built systems for
<BR>
getting the energy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) A macroscopic assembler must use many thousands or millions of different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    types of parts and it must learn how to use all of them. At the most,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Nanotechnology uses 92 different parts (the elements) but in the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    world almost everything we know of is made of only about 20 parts, and for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    life about 10.
</EM><BR>
<P>Before, Dan Fabulich responded that programmed nanoconstruction might
<BR>
actually involve the assembly of many kind of blocks, or &quot;chunks&quot; at
<BR>
many different levels. Any real experts out there, game to engage in
<BR>
relative parts counting exercises? Didn't someone mention that Robert
<BR>
Freitas had something positive to say about this?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) All the many different parts a macroscopic assembler must use are fragile,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and fragile in different ways, the machine must learn the proper handling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    techniques for them all or it will destroy the parts before it can use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    them. There is no way you can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with.
</EM><BR>
<P>Better to say that atoms can't be damaged by mere handling, but that
<BR>
radiation damage is a general concern. Also, see my comment on the
<BR>
*wearing out* of parts, below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4) None of the parts in a macroscopic factory are absolutely identical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    . . . Atoms have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    scratches on them to tell them apart.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5) Nanotechnology can manipulate matter without ever leaving the digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    domain. You may have to deal with a rod 27 carbon atoms long, or 28 atoms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    long, but you never have to worry about a rod 27.5601334 atoms long.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    A Macro assembler wouldn't have that luxury when it tried to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    something with an oak log.
</EM><BR>
<P>Atoms have the premade, dependable, sizes and characteristics that
<BR>
Nature provides for them. I'm not sure though, if this is an advantage,
<BR>
or more of a neutral thing? Dependability is good, other times though,
<BR>
you might wish you could trim to fit!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6) Most of the parts a macroscopic  assembler use would have to be very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    complex and the ways they interact with other macroscopic parts would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    even more complex. Think of the windshield of a car, it interacts poorly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    with the engine block, and even with the windshield frame the interaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    must be managed with great skill or you'll have a disaster. Nanotechnology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    is like building with Lego blocks, you can build structures of arbitrary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    complexity, yet there are only a few different types of blocks and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    interact with other blocks (bounds) in only a few different ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;             John K Clark        <A HREF="mailto:jonkc@att.net?Subject=Re:%20Nano-advantage%20critique%20(was%20Re:%20No%20nanotech%20before%20AI)&In-Reply-To=&lt;39A35407.CEFBDA68@sk.sympatico.ca&gt;">jonkc@att.net</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>This could imply some complications in designing and testing the exact
<BR>
interactions that you need for effective *self-replicating* factories,
<BR>
which Drexler and others have theorized as necessary for the most
<BR>
generally programmable kinds of construction. If there is no &quot;trim to
<BR>
fit&quot; that could mean a lot of assemblies and sub-assemblies to quickly
<BR>
build one another into a self replicating system over all? Or, maybe it
<BR>
*wouldn't* take so much overhead for self-replication? It's hard to
<BR>
judge in general, with natural living systems being the main existence
<BR>
proof for this sort of thing. Also, early nanotech might not be
<BR>
tremendously programmable, nor might it be much like robots building
<BR>
robots, nor like a cell dividing, even. Instead, the earliest nanotech
<BR>
might be more of a chemical trick of self-assembly, molecular strands
<BR>
locking into one another. Living cells make use of something like this
<BR>
when proteins fold (particular stretches of a protein attract to make
<BR>
the protein fold a given way).
<BR>
<P>All of which brings me to the point that nanoparts shouldn't ever wear
<BR>
out, just as a result of working in a well built nanomachine (this is
<BR>
most closely related to John Clark's point #3). This is a great
<BR>
advantage when it comes time to build large machine systems. For
<BR>
instance, if you tried building a replicating factory from Legos, you
<BR>
would likely run into the problem of the Legos wearing out at least a
<BR>
bit, not snapping together so well, maybe wearing out more than a bit
<BR>
too, as the most often used construction gadgets finally began to make
<BR>
some headway on the replication problem. With molecular gadgets, not
<BR>
only would there be no wear, the parts would have much less mass, and
<BR>
could hence be made to move towards a useful result (like replicating)
<BR>
much faster. So one thing that's motivated me to comment on this is that
<BR>
John sort of missed what may be the two biggest reasons for expecting
<BR>
results from nanotech, namely:
<BR>
<P>1. &quot;No Wear&quot;, and
<BR>
<P>2.  &quot;Speed of assembly of low mass parts&quot; (being relatively speedy for
<BR>
nano-based parts, compared to virtually anything else, especially given
<BR>
the &quot;No Wear&quot; property, which is unique to nanotech, as far as I can
<BR>
tell).
<BR>
<P>Oh, and just as a final thought, or analogy of sorts, consider that
<BR>
practically every farm has a fancy gadget that you could compare to an
<BR>
enzyme, namely the baler for packaging grass into winter cattle feed. A
<BR>
baler gobbles up a bunch of stuff, presses it together in a small space
<BR>
where it can't get away and out pops a pre-determined shape -- now,
<BR>
that's a lot like what a chemical enzyme does to atoms! Just a thought,
<BR>
so long for now.
