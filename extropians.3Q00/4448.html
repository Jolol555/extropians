<EM>&gt;You hit in directly on the nail Phil!  I couldn't have said it better 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;myself!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Aa I suggested early on in this thread, free-market in and of itself is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessarily the problem, but is obviously integrated with the fact that you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a monopolized and centralized state that can be bought.  What is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alternative? That has been one of the thrusts of my argument.  It must 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;asked how can a free-market effectively enable a social contract that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minimize loss of individual civil liberties, maximize individual freedom 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prosperity.  Notice that I placed special emphasis on the individual.

People spend a lot of money today on market &quot;equalizers&quot; like insurance.  
<BR>
Without insurance, a single disaster can wipe out the average individual or 
<BR>
family, whereas the wealthy individual can &quot;self-insure.&quot;  In a contractual 
<BR>
society, I would expect this trend to continue.  Insurance is available 
<BR>
today for just about anything - loss of job, loss of life, loss of home, 
<BR>
legal expenses, etc.  Eliminate criminal law and put everything on a 
<BR>
common-law, arbitrational tort basis and it is hard to see what insurance 
<BR>
couldn't cover.  Of course, premiums will vary according to actuarial risk.
<BR>
<P>But, today you can lower your car insurance by living in a safer area, 
<BR>
paying more attention to your driving, driving a survivable vehicle, not 
<BR>
drinking and driving, etc.  There are books and advisors available to tell 
<BR>
you how to lower your insurance by intelligently reducing risk.  Insurance 
<BR>
companies can be a formidable ally for the &quot;little guy&quot; up against 
<BR>
concentrated interests.
