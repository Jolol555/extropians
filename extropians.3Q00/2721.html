Hey, All:
<BR>
<P>This is Alex Heard, the Executive Editor at Wired. Several months ago 
<BR>
I saw a posting on this list about the online investment game 
<BR>
StockGeneration, and the writer's enthusiasm for it prompted me to 
<BR>
assign a story on SG and what it was really all about.
<BR>
<P>I just wanted to let you know that the story will be out in the 
<BR>
September issue, and it's a pretty amazing exposé of how a 
<BR>
Net-powered pyramid scheme -- apparently run by a mysterious Russian 
<BR>
fugitive through offshore servers in Dominica -- attracted nearly 
<BR>
275,000 players worldwide. The person whose message on this list 
<BR>
originally caught my eye -- Rick Potvin -- is now convinced that SG 
<BR>
is a scam, too.
<BR>
<P>I think you'll find this piece interesting, especially since several 
<BR>
of you clearly saw at the time of Potvin's first email that SG was 
<BR>
bad news. If you don't get Wired, please note: the article will be 
<BR>
available online sometime in late September.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
<P><P>Alex Heard
