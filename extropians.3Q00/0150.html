<EM>&gt;You're saying that [...] people are too weak, stupid and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evil to understand their own best, and value such things. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Hang on. Can that be what I meant when I said (on another thread):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If they were sufficiently outraged at this interpretation of the social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contract, they could *vote in a new team*  ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm offering a shockingly glib retort, I know, since we all know that
<BR>
elections in representative democracies aren't terrifically representative
<BR>
or democratic. What's worse, there's a strong suspicion that the Western
<BR>
political and economic tradition has indeed produced a populace that is, at
<BR>
the moment and through no real fault of their own, `too weak, stupid [and
<BR>
in some cases evil, or at least fatally corrupted] to understand their own
<BR>
best'. (I developed this suspicion myself by talking to a few of them, and
<BR>
by looking at what they find most entertaining on television and in clubs,
<BR>
and what they eat, and so on; not a pretty sight, sadly.) Hence the need
<BR>
for enlightened people like us &lt; coff coff &gt; to show them to the way to
<BR>
resolute self-determination, optimistic knuckling down, all that good stuff.
<BR>
<P>Still, there's a lot of leeway even now for people to look at the world,
<BR>
think about how things are (and maybe even how things could be), and vote
<BR>
with their... vote. And via their option to engage in activism inside
<BR>
political and extra-political bodies. Must we ignore their general wishes,
<BR>
as manifest in the status quo, because they are too weak, stupid and
<BR>
corrupted to understand their own best? In a sense, yes, since we wish to
<BR>
change their current opinions. By persuasion. But if they remain
<BR>
unpersuaded, what do you advise? Doesn't the marketplace of ideas tell us
<BR>
what they have selected, and does that not make it Good? (Not a chance, pal.)
