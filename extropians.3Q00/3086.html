<EM>&gt; Perhaps, but like credit cards, I can see a system evolving where only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those with implants will be given many privileges.  If you operate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strictly with cash, it's nearly impossible now to rent a car, stay in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hotel, or have regular cell phone service. Also, I can see various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insurance companies giving discounts to those people willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be tracked in their automobiles.  In other words, privacy will be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pricey commodity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good news! Progressive Insurance, based in Ohio, will now offer 25% to 50%
<BR>
discount on car insurance if you fit their patented Autograph device in your
<BR>
car.
<BR>
<P>See <A HREF="http://www1.progressive.com/media_relations/2nd_patent.htm">http://www1.progressive.com/media_relations/2nd_patent.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>This device contains a GPS receiver and a mobile phone. It monitors, and
<BR>
records, when, where, and how fast you drive and sends the info back to
<BR>
Progressive.
<BR>
<P>Progressive will analyze your driving habits and alter your monthly bill
<BR>
based on your actual, rather than your statistically possible, risk. They
<BR>
estimate that this may save you between 25% and 50% off your premium.
<BR>
<P>So, for example, if you have a second car which is driven less, don't drive
<BR>
in rush hour, you stay at the speed limit, and you don't park in high risk
<BR>
areas, you'll pay less. (And you'll probably live longer by being a better
<BR>
behaved driver).
<BR>
<P>Before you immediately panic about this surveillance of your behavior,
<BR>
remember that your mobile phone is already (or very soon will be) providing
<BR>
the authorities with very similar information.
<BR>
<P>Now, can this info be requested (subpoenaed) by people who may have an
<BR>
interest in your movements?
<BR>
<P>Who cares?  Zero and Spike - grab your discounts now!
