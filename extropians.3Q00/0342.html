<P>LOL... I like this part, &quot;Advice For Christians, or 
<BR>
How To Protect Your Faith&quot;, a little farther up on the
<BR>
<P>same page:
<BR>
<P><PRE>
---
<P>01. Ensure that your concept of God is so vague that 
    nobody can know precisely what you are talking 
    about. 
<P>02. Pay no attention to people who try to reason with 
    you. Know that they are mere shysters out to 
    deceive you. 
<P>03. If doubts arise in your mind, then make the God-
    concept even more vague. If possible, move God 
    beyond the reaches of thought where He'll be safe.
<P><P>04. If your beliefs seem to contradict one another, 
    simply ignore the fact. Chant to yourself &quot;God is 
    infinitely mysterious&quot; two hundred or so times. 
<P>05. Learn to fully submit to God. In this way, you can
<P>    cease the irritating habit of thinking and soon 
    attain Peace. 
<P>06. Never cease to harden your beliefs. Otherwise, 
    reality will begin to seep into your life and 
    you'll be in real trouble. If you are having 
    difficulties, go to church services on a more 
    regular basis. 
<P>07. Take time to study the sciences. By doing so, you 
    will be better able to distort and misrepresent 
    them. 
    [ Case in point: In the local paper where I live,
      there was a &quot;letter to the editor&quot;/opinion
      column yesterday that just stunned me at the
      sheer inanity of it-- the person insisted that 
      the genome map project is &quot;proof&quot; of 'God's
      existence'...why? because it's referred to as a
      'code' or 'book of life', etc etc... Oh, so now
      newspaper/magazine columnists' and biotech co.'s
<P>      PR people's overused analogy-ish words are 
      'proof' of _anything_, aside from some people's
      apparent lack of reasoning abilites? Wow...wow.
]
<P>08. Do not read the Gospels too closely as you may 
    find some disturbing things. If you do find a 
    threatening passage, ignore it. If some unease 
    remains, go to your local preacher. His life is 
    dedicated to your well-being. 
<P>09. Above all, do not think for yourself. If you do, 
    your friends will leave you and you'll be alone. 
    God does not approve of anti-social ways. 
    [ Unless the person doesn't believe in God - even
      if they believe in another god, but not The One
      True God(TM)...which is always by definition the
      god _you_ believe in, and any other god is just
      a False God(TM) (while the other people believe 
      the same thing from their perspective!) - and
      then it's fine to ignore them all you want. ] 
<P>10. Listen to your feelings. If they are happy, then 
    God is happy - for God created us to be happy, did
<P>    he not? 
<P>Note: Do not hesitate to use violence, whether against
<P>a threatening thought or an evil atheist. God 
thoroughly approves the use of violence to protect the
<P>faith. 
<P>---
<P>Onward,
