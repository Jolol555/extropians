<EM>&gt; &gt; With nanotech on the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, Eugene's suggestion on this score makes sense.  After all, running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a millionfold or billionfold speedup, and with some humans still wanting to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduce, it's easily conceivable that all the Solar System's resources will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be sucked up within the first few hours.
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems to me pretty silly to simply scale up humans as they are today
<BR>
and give them godlike abilities to be super-duper apes instead of merely
<BR>
slightly evolved ones.  You won't sell much progress if that is the way
<BR>
of it.  Fortunately, changing ourselves is also massively enabled. 
<BR>
Also, reproduction is much less turned to when they are a variety of
<BR>
other interesting things to do even among mere mortals.  Lastly,
<BR>
physical reproduction and all physical processes of incorporating
<BR>
physical materials are governed by physical speed limits.  Not by how
<BR>
fast the AI can run.  Trillions of human beings simply cannot be
<BR>
produced in &quot;a few hours&quot;.  Building tools and transport and disposal
<BR>
units and processing the entire solar system simply is not the work of
<BR>
&quot;a few hours&quot;.  Even if you could get all of the sentient beings
<BR>
involved to agree, which is extremely doubtful.  
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My suggestion to the Sysop would be to impose a minimum resource requirement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before someone creates a child; the child has to have at least enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computational resources to run at a reasonable speed with a reasonably-sized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind until the Big Crunch.  This way, even if people try to reproduce at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maximum possible speed using their share of the Solar System, standards of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; living will never drop unacceptably.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Your Sysop has extremely serious problems in its design.  It is expected
<BR>
to know how to resolve the problems and issues of other sentient beings
<BR>
(us) without having ever experienced what it is to be us.  If it is
<BR>
trained to model us well enough to understand and therefore to wisely
<BR>
resolve conflicts then it will in the process become subject potentially
<BR>
to some of the same troubling issues.  There is also the problem of what
<BR>
gives this super-duper-AI its own basic goals and desires.  Supposedly
<BR>
the originals come from the humans who build/train it.  It then
<BR>
exptrapolates super-fast off of that original matrix.  Hmmm.  So how are
<BR>
we going to know, except too late, whether that set included a lot of
<BR>
things very dangerous in the AI?  Or if the set is ultimately
<BR>
self-defeating?  Personally I think such a creature would like be
<BR>
autistic, in that it would not be able to successfully model/understand
<BR>
other sentient beings and/or go catatonic because it does not have
<BR>
enough of a core to self-generate goals and desires that will keep it
<BR>
going.  
<BR>
<P>Your scenario assumes we all will want to go onto the chips, to live
<BR>
inside of VR space.  While that looks largely attractive in many ways I
<BR>
would also expect to have the option to form external, &quot;real-world&quot;
<BR>
bodies and extensions to do &quot;real-world&quot; work and gain a different level
<BR>
of experiences. Some other beings will not wish to ever make a home in
<BR>
VR land.  If the AI respects us it will need to make some room for our
<BR>
choices (within reason).  I am not sure how it will establish its Pax
<BR>
SysOp without doing violence to at least parts of humanity.
