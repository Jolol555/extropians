<P>
I've been chuckling through the entire thread of 'Bugs in
<BR>
Free Markets' because the inherent problems with free
<BR>
markets and anarchy are both obvious and essentially the
<BR>
same.  Despite the fact that I also wish for a true anarchy
<BR>
where freedom is unlimited and tyranny is nonexistent, how
<BR>
do we get there?  Needless to say, I also find it humorous
<BR>
how those in favor of free-markets in this particular thread
<BR>
are cleverly cutting and pasting their response to dodge the
<BR>
real issues.  So I will present them again as saliently as
<BR>
possible:
<BR>
<P>The biggest argument thrown at anarchism, is that if left to
<BR>
its own guises you'll always get feudalism in the end.  Such
<BR>
a system favors the most ruthlessness and most armed person
<BR>
to eventually rule over everyone else.   So what you get
<BR>
ironically is the exact opposite of a true anarchy, an
<BR>
oppressive feudal system.  I suspect that a portion of
<BR>
people who call themselves anarchists, are in fact just
<BR>
feudal tyrants eagerly awaiting the day when they can have
<BR>
power over everyone else.
<BR>
<P>So we are left with Anarchism = Oppressive Feudalism.
<BR>
<P>The conception I see of many peoples' ideas of free-markets
<BR>
is very simple - anarchy allowed to exist solely in economic
<BR>
affairs.  That's probably why many people of this ilk refer
<BR>
to themselves as anarcho-capitalists.  So would it be
<BR>
premature to conclude using the above logic, the economic
<BR>
anarchy = economic feudalism.  Would I be out of line by
<BR>
saying that some people who calls themselves free-marketeers
<BR>
are also in fact just closet tyrants with a knack for making
<BR>
money, just waiting to take over?  Well, the burden of proof
<BR>
is on them.
<BR>
<P>Some would say we don't currently have a true free-market,
<BR>
and I agree.  But I see no evidence to suggest that a true
<BR>
free-market would be any better for human freedom and
<BR>
justice than what we have now.  At least now, we have the
<BR>
pretense of a Constitution to protect the liberties of
<BR>
individuals over tyranny.  What are free-market advocates
<BR>
alternatives?  Are you suggesting a universal social
<BR>
contract to safeguard freedom and justice in a free-market?
<BR>
Wouldn't that be the re-creation of  governmental
<BR>
intervention all over again?  If so, then you are no longer
<BR>
left with a free-market again.
<BR>
<P>I challenge anyone on this list to demonstrate how
<BR>
free-markets can exist without a feudalist tyranny
<BR>
resulting.  Demonstrate how such a system  will not favor
<BR>
the rich over poor when it comes to basic civil rights and
<BR>
justice.  If you can't, then you should stop complaining
<BR>
when people call you fascists or at best platocracists.
<BR>
Sure companies are there to meet the demands of the consumer
<BR>
and stockholders, but that just goes to show you that he
<BR>
with the most money - rich consumer, rich stockholder makes
<BR>
all the rules.  Who is there to protect the little guy?  If
<BR>
you don't give a damn about the little guy, then I rest my
<BR>
case.
