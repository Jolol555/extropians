Subject: Re: Distributed Computing
<BR>
<P>Already, I and I'm sure everyone reading this is getting these continuous
<BR>
ads for services disguised as personal messages.  Imagine a world that
<BR>
continuously configured itself to maximize your attention.  Those people who
<BR>
secretly or subconsciously wanted to escape from reality could find
<BR>
themselves like professor Moriarity on TNG, permanently ensconced in a box
<BR>
with no further relevance to anything outside itself.  Mack Reynolds
<BR>
actually wrote a novel on that theme sometime in the '50's or perhaps '60's,
<BR>
as I recall.
<BR>
Of course, it could be argued that religion performs that service today. 
<BR>
Will we have wars in the future based on what reality you want?
<BR>
<P>Ryan v24.2:
<BR>
<P>I imagine that each individual's 'reality' could be customized to their
<BR>
preference.  Maybe we'll each live in a holo-deck simulation of our
<BR>
choosing.  Maybe we already do :).  The Matrix has you, Neo... This also
<BR>
leads me to think of the Polices (where uploaded humans reside) in Egan's
<BR>
_Diaspora_, where each person appeared to have an infinitely-configurable
<BR>
'preferred virtual hang-out' (where perhaps ve was assigned 'administrative
<BR>
permissions'?) and where ve was surrounded by virtual objects of vis
<BR>
choosing.  In that futurist novel, at least, people seem to have transcended
<BR>
'un-provoked' advertising.  I am hopeful for such an outcome.
<BR>
<P>Yeah I get those email ads.  I have a pet peeve about advertising of that
<BR>
nature.  I don't watch television because I can't stand the notion of being
<BR>
programmed with stupid jingles and 'catchy phrases'.  (That, and because TV
<BR>
isn't interactive.)  I realize trying to avoid advertising is somewhat
<BR>
ridiculous because there's really nowhere I can go to escape it, while
<BR>
maintaining my choice of lifestyle and information gathering habits.  I also
<BR>
realize the advertising is (sometimes) what supports the broadcast of the
<BR>
program or article I DO wish to attend to.  But I don't imagine this as a
<BR>
necessary element in the future.  I have been somewhat successful at
<BR>
'selective attention' when it comes to reading - when looking at magazines
<BR>
and web pages, for example, I find that I don't see many types of banners or
<BR>
ads.  Doesn't enter short term memory anymore.  Until they come up with
<BR>
another flavor, of course, and I have to reconfigure my perceptual filters
<BR>
to counter their reconfiguration of the spam, etc., etc.

I think it will do is give more momentum to the development of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;decentralized information storage and exchange systems, and better metrics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for automating replication, migration, and maintenance of information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;integrity within them.  I am really interested to see what kinds of systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and protocols emerge to support (more universal) 'nomadic data access' and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'task mobility.'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Y'all have thoughts on the 'ubiquitous computing environment' paradigm?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is being approached in different ways by different institutions, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was reading DARPA's 'Ubicomp' proposal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;( <A HREF="http://www.darpa.mil/ito/Solicitations/CBD_00-45.html">http://www.darpa.mil/ito/Solicitations/CBD_00-45.html</A>  )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(snip)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Ubiquitous Computing Initiative (Ubicomp) will address issues in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;providing a new computing environment in which the users' physical spaces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;become embedded with computing functionality, as the present-day computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disappears.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (/snip)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and pondering the potential impacts of its application, in conjunction with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'distributed computing', on the Internet / global level, and it really got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my gears spinning.  Is this the next step?  How far off, from there, is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'sentient' Internet? ;) Does the idea of living and working inside of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fully interactive computer (say, your house in 2020) unsettle you?  Isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this in a way conducive to the emergence of a transparent society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(reference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the MAS [mutually assured surveillance] discussion a few months ago)? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your house is a node on a global, distributed computing network, and one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's directives is to identify patterns in your behaviors/intentions as its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resident in order to preemptively feed you information it thinks you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want, doesn't that imply that information about you is going to be 'out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there', potentially everywhere?  Yeah, okay, encrypt it.  Encrypt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everything!  But who/what holds your encryption keys in an environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;designed for constant interaction to automate the 'tediosities' of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life, including your decisions, when everybody is actually using the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great, big computer?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cheers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ryan
