<EM>&gt; &gt; 1) As you may have heard Microsoft is trying very much to regain control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by putting all of their software back into their central servers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could you cite a reference for this?  (It sounds a bit far-fetched.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps you mean that they intend to move to an active license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monitoring system for their software -- i.e. their software comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from their servers when you need it.  This is &quot;software on demand&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or &quot;software rental&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, he means &quot;putting all of their software back into their central
<BR>
servers&quot;.  Yes, it's boneheaded.  Yes, it'd be massively stupid for
<BR>
responsible consumers to switch to.  Doesn't mean they ain't gonna try
<BR>
to get away with it, and doesn't mean a lot of people won't buy it
<BR>
anyway just because it's &quot;the latest version from Microsoft&quot; (and older
<BR>
versions, as always, aren't supported anymore).  Reference what little
<BR>
*is* known about their .net initiative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The only way you'll be able to use software in the future is by logging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in to their system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmmmm, I doubt it will fly.  I can always disconnect my ADSL line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I boot my home PC.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which means your application fails when the critical piece of code on
<BR>
Microsoft's servers can't be called.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Wow, this sounds secure.  Just think, all those things you do on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computer - private memos, dictation's, dirty pictures, all of it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be stored and manipulated via programs you login into at Microsoft's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 'Central' servers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nobody in their right mind will buy this option.  Corporate presidents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will not store corporate data at Microsoft unless Microsoft accepts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liability for data loss, guarantees privacy, etc.  Even Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't have pockets deep enough for that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you may be confusing getting the software &quot;on demand&quot; from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a remote server with where the data the software uses is stored.
</EM><BR>
<P>Microsoft's logic seems to be: &quot;if the software is stored on our
<BR>
servers, and people have to connect to us - through a script that
<BR>
verifies they paid to use it - then there can be no more piracy, plus a
<BR>
bunch of neat monitoring and easy upgrading becomes available&quot;.  Nowhere
<BR>
in there is there any acknowledgement of the customer's needs.  (For
<BR>
those who disbelieve that corporations can act this dumb, I typically
<BR>
point to DIVX - and its demise, and the reasons for its demise - as a
<BR>
good analogy.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Regardless of anything they may claim, they will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; full power to control what you see, use and do, and ultimately have all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the tools necessary to collect complete dossiers on what we all use,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; how we're using it, and where their software is being accessed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, they could monitor you every time you start Excel or Powerpoint
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but that would require permanent connections for all PCs and we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a long way away from that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not in offices and business situations, we're not.  (Not quite *there*,
<BR>
I'll admit, but close enough - or, at least, so Microsoft believes, for
<BR>
good reason - that forcing the rest to upgrade to use Microsoft's
<BR>
software is a minor loss.)  And for a number of the applications they're
<BR>
looking at doing this for, businesses are the main users.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How you extrapolate that to &quot;full power to control what you see or do&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't clear to me.  You can make your data arbitrarily secure by simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encrypting it.
</EM><BR>
<P>For those of us who think to do that, and can put an
<BR>
encryption/decryption filter over the data going into and out of
<BR>
Microsoft's applications, yes.  That's &lt; 1% of all users.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If Microsoft makes their licensing of software more restrictive people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will simply move to other suppliers, esp. open source systems if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel so inclined.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is why a lot of open source advocates are cheering Microsoft's
<BR>
latest business plans, or at least this aspect of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; This whole thing bothers me a great deal, and for all intents and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; purposes is a return to Orwellian thinking with a vengeance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most software is licensed, not owned.  If the supplier wants to &quot;fix&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the software so the license conditions can be verified (to reduce piracy)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then they have the right to do that.  If they do it in a way that annoys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people, then they will lose market share.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only so long as there are competitors.  Even with the OS split off, the
<BR>
applications group will still have a monopoly on Office file formats
<BR>
(which, having tried to reverse-engineer one once, I can tell you *are*
<BR>
sometimes encrypted).  People keep reverse engineering these, true, but
<BR>
the formats change with every revision...and if it takes you long enough
<BR>
to reverse engineer the format that, by the time you're done, another
<BR>
revision has been released, well...
