<P><EM>&gt;Good, so are we.  This is meaningless drivel.  We want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;build a system of governance--with most of the same services
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that governments provide today--but on a moral foundation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We only seek to destroy those functions of government that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are positively evil,
</EM><BR>
<P>You see, this is what I was talking about: Governent &quot;evil&quot;? Why don't you 
<BR>
call electricity evil? It sometimes kills people. Cheese kills people, 
<BR>
eventually. You don't call cheese evil, do you?
<BR>
Goverment is just a tool. Yes, I think that people, especially the kind of 
<BR>
people who work in govt, are generally bad. But govt  workers are our 
<BR>
employees. We need to control them, and not them let &quot;farm&quot; us, as they 
<BR>
would like to do.
<BR>
<P>They will push us as far as we will let them.
<BR>
<P>And speaking of evidence/proof etc., what should we make of the result of 
<BR>
rapid change from statism to ... some form of anarchy that we have seen in 
<BR>
post-cold war Russia? Isn't that the closest thing to real life evidence 
<BR>
that there are problems in the statism to libertarianism change model?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have no resentment at all to sharing as such, but I /do/ resent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very strongly the gun pointed at me, and that's not just an &quot;attitude&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or point of view.  It is a simple, undeniable fact.  Monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government exercises its madates by FORCE, period.  If you deny
</EM><BR>
<P>What if I were to buy shares in a corporation, and then attend a 
<BR>
shareholders' meeting, raise hell, destroy the property there, and otherwise 
<BR>
be bad, does the company have any right to remove me by force? I do have 
<BR>
rights, no?
<BR>
You see, in any organization, not everyone will agree on the proper course 
<BR>
of action in every circumstance. But actions must be taken regardless. Force 
<BR>
may be needed. Such are the cold realities, etc.
