<EM>&gt;  &gt; You and all of us.  I have over a thousand titles, most of em
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; hardback.  Ideally I would like to ASCII all the text without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; destroying the books, if possible.  Let me know if you find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;without destroying the books&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I should have said &quot;without destroying the bindings.&quot;  We have
<BR>
an adjustable paper feeding scanner at work, but to use that
<BR>
to scan my books I would need to saw off the bindings.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you succeed in this effort, would you still keep the books?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  I would use the ASCII files mostly for finding passages
<BR>
that I remember but that do not show up in the index.  I often
<BR>
recall a sentence or a phrase that was part of a passage I want
<BR>
to review.  Consider the set of book written by Asimov over
<BR>
a period of more than 30 years, his nonfiction essays.  There are
<BR>
24 of these, not including compilations.  Very entertaining stuff,
<BR>
but nearly impossible to index.  So I made up a topical index
<BR>
and sent it to him via email, but he was already very sick and
<BR>
I never heard back.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I design a virtual reality of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; home in the future, the virtual reality would have to have shelves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my books.
</EM><BR>
<P>I love the *smell* of old books.  Im queer that way.  Used to
<BR>
like to go the library as a little kid and read the oldest book
<BR>
I could find, and think, WOW this person was messed up.  {8^D
<BR>
I fondly remember my library surfing days every time I open up an
<BR>
old book and that smell comes out.
<BR>
<P>I opened up one of my college text books the other day, and
<BR>
that smell came out.  It was one I bought new.  In college.
<BR>
Now it has that smell.
<BR>
<P>I hate the smell of old books.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't like reading long texts electronically. I would be tickled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pink to have my books electronically available with which to search...
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  As Eliezer so aptly stated, books give us only pictures of
<BR>
information.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have a sense that many here have similar small libraries; are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we so unusual to other people?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am, but not because of my books.  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I really miss Stanford's bookstore and libraries.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja me too, and its just down the street.  Truth is, I dont read
<BR>
nearly as many books now as I did in my misspent youth.  Now,
<BR>
in my misspent adulthood, the internet has taken the place of a
<BR>
lot of that, not just the lists, but web surfing, etc.
<BR>
<P>Before it is all over, we will see that the internet has impacted
<BR>
human society even more profoundly than did the invention
<BR>
of the printing press.  The web age is the new Renaissance.
<BR>
Furthermore it is far easier to spell.  spike
