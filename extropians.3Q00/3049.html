<EM>&gt; Excellent doctor, this one.  Besides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; that good quality, she has small fingers...  {8^D  spike

<P>James, let me guess.  You are young.  Less than about... 40?  You see,
<BR>
my young friend, you have a most unpleasant experience still ahead of
<BR>
you, for when you visit your doctor after ~40, you must have your prostate
<BR>
examined.  I found this to be a *most* distasteful experience.  Any man
<BR>
over 40 who visits the doctor *for any reason*, including to deliver a
<BR>
package, gets a finger up the kazoo.  {8-[
<BR>
<P>On the up side {of sorts} this experience developed in me a sense of
<BR>
sympathy for homosexuals, for after having had a prostate exam, I realize
<BR>
that their form of lovemaking must be excruciating.  For that reason, they
<BR>
must have an overwhelming desire to please their mates, at their own
<BR>
expense, which is a desireable personality characteristic.  Gays, is this
<BR>
notion approximately correct?  spike
