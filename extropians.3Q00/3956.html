<P>&lt;&lt; I believe Roy Walfords longevity studies spanning over 40 years have
<BR>
&nbsp;demonstrated that maximum lifespan can be extended through carefully planned
<BR>
&nbsp;caloric restriction. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>As far as anyone has been able to prove no human being has lived passed the 
<BR>
age of 120 years.  With caloric restriction this may be passed, by not by 
<BR>
much IMHO.  In experiments with caloric restriction in animals there is a 
<BR>
trend in the ability to increase maximum life span and the complexity of the 
<BR>
animal.  Protozoan life spans have been increased by 92% while the life spans 
<BR>
of  rats by 42%.  Guppies were only 9%.  A slower metabolism is sure to slow 
<BR>
down our rate of cell division in some cell lines but I'd be curious to see 
<BR>
how it effects others.  Skin, kidney, or liver cells for example.  Also there 
<BR>
is the fact that most humans never come close to reaching the maximum life 
<BR>
span.  How does the Hayflick limit correspond to this?
<BR>
<P>My own opinion is that in the next ten or fifteen years we will be able to 
<BR>
isolate, genetically repair, and then clone our own stem cells.  Telomeres 
<BR>
would be built back up, mutations fixed, and then any part of our bodies 
<BR>
needing to be will be replaced.  Whether it be an entire organ or a fresh 
<BR>
injection of cells to diseased parts.  The basis for this is already here and 
<BR>
holds much more promise then cryonics, diets, supplements, and other life 
<BR>
extending therapies which have limited scientific validity.
