<P>
<EM>&gt; Thanks, Hal, that's the most cohesive &quot;take&quot; on this I have seen. Whereas 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copyrights laws have been struggling to keep artists and inventors from being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outright frauded, they've often done little to help artists to make money, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather we are given the option waiting til the fraud has been perpetrated and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then suing to collect (about 50-50% chance, and only if you can afford to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sue). 
</EM><BR>
<P>Another great frustration of mine in this never-ending discussion is
<BR>
having to constantly remind people of the difference between copyrights,
<BR>
trademarks, and fraud.  Passing someone's work off as your own is fraud,
<BR>
and trading on the good name of an artist without eir consent is a
<BR>
violation of the trademark on their good name, and I absolutely
<BR>
support prosecution of those and always have.  Copyright criminalizes
<BR>
/honest/ copying: it prevents me from putting a copy of (or adaptation
<BR>
of), say, Damien's latest book on my web site even if I correctly
<BR>
identify it as his, and provide links to his own site and/or links to
<BR>
where they can buy authorized prints, and do not claim in any way to
<BR>
be associated with him.
<BR>
<P>I agree with Hal that copyright will become basically unenforceable
<BR>
and irrelevant as technology advances.  You and Hal and others might
<BR>
bemoan this as unfortunate while I celebrate, but we all really do
<BR>
want to see good creative works produced and see artists prosper.
<BR>
But I look at it from the demand side: it is precisely because I and
<BR>
others /want/ good art that it is up to /us/ to find ways to ensure
<BR>
that its producers are found and rewarded.  It may be up to us as
<BR>
comsumers to take on the burden of finding business models that make
<BR>
this possible in a world where information is free.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
