The Creation
<BR>
<P>And God created the hominids, naming two of them Homo-Australopithecus-Afarensis and Lucy-in-the-Sky-with-Diamonds. Then he realized this was confusing. So he created paleoanthropologists, to sort it out. But God realized very soon that hominids would not understand quantum foams, inflationary fractal universes, entangled particle-waves, black-holes with hair, solitons and white-dwarfs. So he created myths and omega-points. And God realized this was confusing. So he created extropians, to sort it out. And confusion reigned in the valley of the shadow of doubt. So God became angry. So angry that he said: thanks to me it's friday. And he made the weekend. And he saw that it was a very good idea.
