<EM>&gt; our incomplete information about the quantum system,

<P>Just a minute, hold on there! As part of your discussion, you yourself
<BR>
mention the &quot;amplitude squared&quot; property of quantum waves, where the
<BR>
wave just *has* to be considered as have a steadily &quot;rotating&quot; complex
<BR>
vector amplitude. Now, it's my understanding that to get a normalized
<BR>
probability distribution for the location of the associated electron, or
<BR>
whatever, this really *does* involve squaring this complex amplitude, or
<BR>
it involves squaring the sum total of any such vectors as may be
<BR>
interfering in a given region of space. This is a situation quite unlike
<BR>
anything in regular probability theory, something quite different added
<BR>
in there, right?
<BR>
<P>Say you've got a single photon waveform, and say this wave is travelling
<BR>
through two slits in a single photon, double slit experiment. The
<BR>
probability of the photon hitting a screen is then a kind of
<BR>
interference pattern of high and low probabilities as you move across
<BR>
the screen. The waveform itself must then actually be a real, extended
<BR>
structure of *some* kind, it seems to me, since it directly governs the
<BR>
probability of finding the photon in the various bands of the
<BR>
interference pattern.
<BR>
<P>Now, if the extended photon wave is actually real, then what happens to
<BR>
most of it when the photon actually strikes the screen at one particular
<BR>
spot? Does any momentum associated with the wave just suddenly vanish or
<BR>
does it split off into another World, or what? These extended complex
<BR>
amplitude structures have complicated shapes, and you need them for
<BR>
predictions, so I'm not seeing how regular Bayesian probabilities would
<BR>
explain them.
