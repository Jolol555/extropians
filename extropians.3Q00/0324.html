<P>
One thing I don't understand about this concern with &quot;web bugs&quot;: can't
<BR>
doubleclick get the same effect just by putting an ad banner on the page?
<BR>
Either way there is a fetch to doubleclick's server, with the referrer
<BR>
field set up from the page you were viewing, and with your IP address
<BR>
and cookies included.
<BR>
<P>Granted, web bugs are more secretive, as you don't even see the banner.
<BR>
But these days, most commercial pages are so loaded up with banners,
<BR>
most people wouldn't even notice if there was a doubleclick banner there.
<BR>
Porn pages, which was one of the places where evil web bugs are said to
<BR>
be found, are the worst as far as banners.
<BR>
<P>Unless you are constantly checking every banner you see, you're probably
<BR>
not even aware already when doubleclick or any other company is getting
<BR>
information about your browsing.  I don't see that web bugs are all that
<BR>
much of an additional threat to your privacy.
