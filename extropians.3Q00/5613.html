<EM>&gt; &gt;Oh, why bother.  I really am starting to get a bit frustrated over here.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;been talking about this for weeks and it doesn't seem to have any effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;whatsoever.  Nobody is even bothering to distinguish between subgoals and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;supergoals.  You're all just playing with words.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To a large extent you are right.  You are talking about computer programming 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strategies.  I, and I believe others in this thread, are really talking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about philosophy.  Perhaps that is because you have in mind the seed AI you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are working on, and I have in mind a more fully developed super-intelligent, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sentient AI.
</EM><BR>
<P>How about just telling us what you want your AI machinery to accomplish,
<BR>
in plain-language, down-to-earth, operational terms.
