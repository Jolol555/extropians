I don't know if it's fair for someone to term Extopianism as Reactionary, Libertarian, for sure. The Libertarian aspect is that technology and money come together best under capitalism.  They does not mean that dictatorships cannot achieve grand things as for as technical development goes, but to keep an open society, capitalism, so far, seems to facilitate it best.
<BR>
<P>An example might be, what good is developing a Messershmidt ME-262, if the wars and massacres that the political state that ran the Reich, insure that B-24 Liberators and British Landcasters inhibit such a plane's production? 
<BR>
<P>Smaller-scale, Robust technologies, tend to flourish under a free-market system, and that system demands funding. If the marketing is success, if the technologuy is successful, then a profit needs to be made. The PC and Telecommunication and Biotechnologies seem to fit this description.

The page above, making some confusion between extropy and negentropy, says that Max More is like Moses (!). His Principles are, for extropians, like the Tables of the Law. The *best do it so* logo and the life-extension goal are mentioned. But the writer is asking *how they'll spend their spare time in the immortality epoch?*. Actually a similar question comes from the very old E. Gombrich:*life time is extended, yes, but I am much more busy now than I was in the '70s, and I cannot understand why!*. Smart drugs (?) and cryonics and mind-loading are also mentioned, in connection to extropism. Romana Machado is mentioned for her transhumanist philosophy. And also Marvin Minsky, the Extropy Institute, those extropic conferences and the cybertopia. The writer says that the political attitude of this movement is very libertarian, but often reactionary.

The page above (1997) is interesting because it comes from the rai.it, the main tv company, owned by the State.
