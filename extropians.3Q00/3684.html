<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I was visiting Bhatinda in Punjab because of an epidemic of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farmer suicides. Punjab used to be the most prosperous agricultural 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regionin India. Today every farmer is in debt and despair. Vast 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stretches of land have become water-logged desert. And as an old 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farmer pointed out, even the trees have stopped bearing fruit because 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heavy use of pesticides have killed the pollinators - the bees and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;butterflies.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Punjab is not alone in experiencing this ecological and social 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disaster. Last year I was in Warangal, Andhra Pradesh where farmers 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have also been committing suicide. Farmers who traditionally grew 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pulses and millets and paddy have been lured by seed companies to buy 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hybrid cotton seeds referred to by the seed merchants as &quot;white 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gold&quot;, which were supposed to make them millionaires. Instead they 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became paupers.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their native seeds have been displaced with new hybrids which cannot 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be saved and need to be purchased every year at high cost. Hybrids 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are also very vulnerable to pest attacks. Spending on pesticides in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warangal has shot up 2000 per cent from $2.5 million in the 1980s to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$50 million in 1997. Now farmers are consuming the same pesticides as 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a way of killing themselves so that they can escape permanently from 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unpayable debt.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporations are now trying to introduce genetically engineered 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seed which will further increase costs and ecological risks. That is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why farmers like Malla Reddy of the Andhra Pradesh Farmers' Union had 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uprooted Monsanto's genetically engineered Bollgard cotton in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warangal.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 27th, 25 year old Betavati Ratan took his life because he 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could not pay pack debts for drilling a deep tube well on his two-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acre farm. Thewells are now dry, as are the wells in Gujarat and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rajasthan where more than 50 million people face a water famine.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drought is not a &quot;natural disaster&quot;. It is &quot;man-made&quot;. It is the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of mining of scarce ground water in arid regions to grow 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirsty cash crops for exports instead of water prudent food crops 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for local needs.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is experiences such as these which tell me that we are so wrong to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be smug about the new global economy. I will argue in this lecture 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it istime to stop and think about the impact of globalisation on 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lives of ordinary people. This is vital to achieve sustainability.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seattle and the World Trade Organisation protests last year have 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forced everyone to think again. Throughout this lecture series people 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have referred to different aspects of sustainable development taking 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globalisation for granted. For me it is now time radically to re-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluate what we are doing. For what we are doing in the name of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globalisation to the poor is brutal and unforgivable. This is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specially evident in India as we witness the unfolding disasters of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globalisation, especially in food and agriculture.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who feeds the world? My answer is very different to that given by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most people.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is women and small farmers working with biodiversity who are the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;primary food providers in the Third World, and contrary to the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dominant assumption, their biodiversity based small farms are more 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;productive than industrial monocultures.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich diversity and sustainable systems of food production are 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being destroyed in the name of increasing food production. However, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the destruction of diversity, rich sources of nutrition 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disappear. When measured in terms of nutrition per acre, and from the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perspective biodiversity, the so called &quot;high yields&quot; of industrial 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agriculture or industrial fisheries do not imply more production of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food and nutrition.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yields usually refers to production per unit area of a single crop. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output refers to the total production of diverse crops and products. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planting only one crop in the entire field as a monoculture will of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course increase its individual yield. Planting multiple crops in a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mixture will have low yields of individual crops, but will have high 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total output of food. Yields have been defined in such a way as to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make the food production on small farms by small farmers disappear. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hides the production by millions of women farmers in the Third 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World - farmers like those in my native Himalaya who fought against 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logging in the Chipko movement, who in their terraced fields even 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today grow Jhangora (barnyard millet), Marsha (Amaranth), Tur (Pigeon 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pea), Urad (Black gram), Gahat (horse gram), Soya Bean (Glycine Max), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhat (Glycine Soya) - endless diversity in their fields. From the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biodiversity perspective, biodiversity based productivity is higher 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than monoculture productivity. I call this blindness to the high 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;productivity of diversity a &quot;Monoculture of the Mind&quot;, which creates 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monocultures in our fields and in our world.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mayan peasants in the Chiapas are characterised as unproductive 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they produce only 2 tons of corn per acre. However, the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overall food output is 20 tons per acre when the diversity of their 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beans and squashes, their vegetables their fruit trees are taken into 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Java, small farmers cultivate 607 species in their home gardens. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sub-Saharan Africa, women cultivate 120 different plants. A single 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;home garden in Thailand has 230 species, and African home gardens 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have more than 60 species of trees.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rural families in the Congo eat leaves from more than 50 species of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their farm trees.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study in eastern Nigeria found that home gardens occupying only 2 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent of a household's farmland accounted for half of the farm's 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total output. In Indonesia 20 per cent of household income and 40 per 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cent of domestic food supplies come from the home gardens managed by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research done by FAO has shown that small biodiverse farms can 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produce thousands of times more food than large, industrial 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monocultures.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And diversity in addition to giving more food is the best strategy 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for preventing drought and desertification.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the world needs to feed a growing population sustainably is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biodiversity intensification, not the chemical intensification or the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intensification of genetic engineering. While women and small 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peasants feed the world through biodiversity we are repeatedly told 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that without genetic engineering and globalisation of agriculture the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world will starve. In spite of all empirical evidence showing that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genetic engineering does not produce more food and in fact often 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leads to a yield decline, it is constantly promoted as the only 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative available for feeding the hungry.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I ask, who feeds the world?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deliberate blindness to diversity, the blindness to nature's 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;production, production by women, production by Third World farmers 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allows destruction and appropriation to be projected as creation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the much flouted &quot;golden rice&quot; or genetically 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineered Vitamin A rice as a cure for blindness. It is assumed that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without genetic engineering we cannot remove Vitamin A deficiency. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nature gives us abundant and diverse sources of vitamin A. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If rice was not polished, rice itself would provide Vitamin A. If 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herbicides were not sprayed on our wheat fields, we would have 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bathua, amaranth, mustard leaves as delicious and nutritious greens 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that provide Vitamin A.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women in Bengal use more than 150 plants as greens - Hinche sak 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Enhydra fluctuans), Palang sak (Spinacea oleracea), Tak palang 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Rumex vesicarious), Lal Sak (Amaranthus gangeticus) - to name but a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the myth of creation presents biotechnologists as the creators of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitamin A, negating nature's diverse gifts and women's knowledge of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how to use this diversity to feed their children and families.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most efficient means of rendering the destruction of nature, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local economies and small autonomous producers is by rendering their 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;production invisible.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women who produce for their families and communities are treated as 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`non-productive' and `economically' inactive. The devaluation of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women's work, and of work done in sustainable economies, is the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;natural outcome of a system constructed by capitalist patriarchy. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how globalisation destroys local economies and destruction 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself is counted as growth.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip The globalisation of non-sustainable industrial agriculture is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;literally evaporating the incomes of Third World farmers through a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;combination of devaluation of currencies, increase in costs of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;production and a collapse in commodity prices.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers everywhere are being paid a fraction of what they received 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the same commodity a decade ago. The Canadian National Farmers 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union put it like this in a report to the senate this year:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;While the farmers growing cereal grains - wheat, oats, corn - earn 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative returns and are pushed close to bankruptcy, the companies 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that make breakfast cereals reap huge profits. In 1998, cereal 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companies Kellogg's, Quaker Oats, and General Mills enjoyed return on 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equity rates of 56%, 165% and 222% respectively. While a bushel of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corn sold for less than $4, a bushel of corn flakes sold for $133 ... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe farmers are making too little because others are taking too 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a World Bank report has admitted that &quot;behind the polarisation of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domestic consumer prices and world prices is the presence of large 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tradingcompanies in international commodity markets.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While farmers earn less, consumers pay more. In India, food prices 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have doubled between 1999 and 2000. The consumption of food grains in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rural areas has dropped by 12%. Increased economic growth through 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global commerce is based on pseudo surpluses. More food is being 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;traded while thepoor are consuming less. When growth increases 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poverty, when real production becomes a negative economy, and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speculators are defined as &quot;wealth creators&quot;, something has gone 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong with the concepts and categories of wealth and wealth creation. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing the real production by nature and people into a negative 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economy implies that production of real goods and services is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declining, creating deeper poverty for the millions who are not part 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the dot.com route to instant wealth creation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women - as I have said - are the primary food producers and food 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processors in the world. However, their work in production and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processing is now becoming invisible.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the McKinsey corporation said: &quot;American food giants 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognise that Indian agro-business has lots of room to grow, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially in food processing. India processes a minuscule 1 per cent 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the food it grows compared with 70 per cent for the U.S...&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we Indians eat our food raw. Global consultants fail 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to see the 99 per cent food processing done by women at household 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level, or by the small cottage industry because it is not controlled 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by global agribusiness. 99% of India's agroprocessing has been 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intentionally kept atthe small level. Now , under the pressure of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globalisation, things are changing. Pseudo hygiene laws are being 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses to shut down local economies and small scale processing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 1998, small scale local processing of edible oil was banned 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in India through a &quot;packaging order&quot; which made sale of open oil 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illegal and required all oil to be packaged in plastic or aluminium. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shut down tiny &quot;ghanis&quot; or cold pressed mills. It destroyed the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market for our diverse oilseeds - mustard, linseed, sesame, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;groundnut, coconut.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the take-over of the edible oil industry has affected 10 million 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;livelihoods. The take over of flour or &quot;atta&quot; by packaged branded 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flour will cost 100 million livelihoods. And these millions are being 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pushed into new poverty.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forced use of packaging will increase the environmental burden of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;millions of tonnes of waste.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The globalisation of the food system is destroying the diversity of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local food cultures and local food economies. A global monoculture is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being forced on people by defining everything that is fresh, local 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and handmade as a health hazard. Human hands are being defined as the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worst contaminants, and work for human hands is being outlawed, to be 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replaced by machines and chemicals bought from global corporations. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not recipes for feeding the world, but stealing livelihoods 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the poor to create markets for the powerful.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are being perceived as parasites, to be exterminated for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the &quot;health&quot; of the global economy.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process new health and ecological hazards are being forced on 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third World people through dumping of genetically engineered foods 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and other hazardous products.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, because of a W.T.O. ruling, India has been forced to remove 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restrictions on all imports.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Among the unrestricted imports are carcasses and animal waste 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parts that create a threat to our culture and introduce public health 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hazards such asthe Mad Cow Disease.**
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US Centre for Disease Prevention in Atlanta has calculated that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearly81 million cases of food borne illnesses occur in the US every 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year. Deaths from food poisoning have gone up more up more than four 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times due to deregulation. Most of these infections are caused by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factory farmed meat. The US slaughters 93 million pigs, thirty seven 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million cattle, two million calves, six million horses, goats and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep and eight billion chickens and turkeys each year.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the giant meat industry of US wants to dump contaminated meat 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;producedthrough violent and cruel methods on Indian consumers.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waste of the rich is being dumped on the poor. The wealth of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poor is being violently appropriated through new and clever means 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like patents on biodiversity and indigenous knowledge.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip As humans travel further down the road to non-sustainability, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they become intolerant of other species and blind to their vital role 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in our survival.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, when Indian farmers destroyed Cargill's seed plant in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellary, Karnataka, to protest against seed failure, the Cargill 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Executive stated, &quot;We bring Indian farmers smart technologies 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which prevent bees from usurping the pollen&quot;. When I was 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participating in the United Nations Biosafety Negotiations, Monsanto 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circulated literature to defend its herbicide resistant Roundup ready 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crops on grounds that they prevent &quot;weeds from stealing the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sunshine&quot;. But what Monsanto calls weeds are the green fields that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide Vitamin A rice and prevent blindness in childrenand anaemia 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in women.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worldview that defines pollination as &quot;theft by bees&quot; and claims 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biodiversity &quot;steals&quot; sunshine is a worldview which itself aims at 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stealing nature's harvest by replacing open, pollinated varieties 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with hybrids and sterile seeds, and destroying biodiverse flora with 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herbicidessuch as Roundup. The threat posed to the Monarch butterfly 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by genetically engineered bt crops is just one example of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ecological poverty created by the new biotechnologies. As butterflies 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bees disappear, production is undermined. As biodiversity 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disappears, with it go sources of nutrition and food.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip The world can be fed only by feeding all beings that make the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving food to other beings and species we maintain conditions for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our own food security. In feeding earthworms we feed ourselves. In 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feeding cows, we feed the soil, and in providing food for the soil, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we provide food for humans. This worldview of abundance is based on 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sharing and on a deep awareness of humans as members of the earth 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family. This awareness that in impoverishing other beings, we 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impoverish ourselves and in nourishing other beings, we nourish 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves is the real basis of sustainability.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sustainability challenge for the new millennium is whether global 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economic man can move out of the worldview based on fear and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scarcity, monocultures and monopolies, appropriation and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dispossession and shift to a view based on abundance and sharing, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diversity and decentralisation, andrespect and dignity for all beings.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainability demands that we move out of the economic trap that is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving no space for other species and other people. Economic 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation has become a war against nature and the poor. But the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rules of globalisation are not god - given. They can be changed. They 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be changed. We must bring this war to an end.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip As Gandhi had reminded us: &quot;The earth has enough for everyone's 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needs, but not for some people's greed&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Sujata Gupta, the Tata Energy Research Institute:         I'd like 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to hear your views on sustainable use of scarce inputs like water for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agriculture. What I gathered from your lecture was total condemnation 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the market system.  Vandana Shiva:         Let me first respond by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying - I love markets. I love my local market where local &quot;subgees&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are sold, and one can chat with the women. The tragedy really is that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the market is being turned into the only organising principle for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life, and Wall St is being turned into the only source of value, and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's the disappearance of other markets, other valuesthat I am 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condemning. In terms of water, the solution to water conservation and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scarce water management is not putting it in the hands ofthose who 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can afford to buy the last drop, but to put it in the hands of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community, to use it sustainably within the limits of renewal. The 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water must be returned to the communities and managed as a commons - 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it has to be taken beyond the marketplace.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Professor Marva, University of Delhi:         Can there be 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustainable development without sustainable population?  Vandana 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shiva:         I think non-sustainable population growth is a symptom 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and productof non-sustainable development. It's not that population 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grows by itself as a separate phenomena - you look at the data - 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indian population had stability till 1800 - colonisation, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dispossession of land started to make our population grow. Highest 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth rates of population in England is after the enclosures of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commons. It's the loss of resources of the people that generate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;livelihood and the replacement of resources by labourto be sold on 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;markets in an uncertain daily wage market that triggers population 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth. Population growth is a result of non-sustainable development.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip Gulgit Choudhury, Ram Organics:         I have worked earlier 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Monsanto. I have a simple question to ask you. Suppose you were 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given the opportunity to develop parameters of a social governance 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which ensures sustainability - what would you suggest for countries 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like India.?  Vandana Shiva:         We are in fact involved for the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last few years - generating the kind of criteria through 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participatory democracy building - through ensuring that people at 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every level have the information, through ensuringthat communities 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are organised, to manage collectively the resources that can only be 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustained collectively. If I have the money and power to drilla deep 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tube well I can make dry my neighbour's shallow well and she will 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usually be a very poor woman. And therefore the only way a village 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can conserve its ground water is to do what the &quot;Paani Panchayath&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did in Harash - ensure that water is used within limits. Systems of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;governance have to begin with where people feel the impact, and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore we do require the rebuilding of decentralised direct 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;democracy. I do not see growers as isolated individuals because the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequences of their action are felt by their neighbours. If I am 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growing b.t. corn on my field I killthe monarch butterfly of my 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour's field. Communities, collectives are cohesiveness of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;societies are important to talk about not individual growers, and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is the bottom rung of decision making to which both which 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corporations as well as governments need to be accountable - that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isthe experiment that started after Seattle and that experiment in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accountable localisation to ensure that decisions are made at 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate place and production is carried out at the appropriate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level is really thenew enterprise of democracy that societies are 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involved in around the world, even while globalisation threatens our 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lives.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip **Finally, we had this from last year's Reith lecturer Anthony 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giddens - addressing you Vandana he says -         &quot;I congratulate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you on your challenging presentation. I have to say though I don't 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agree with much of it. Isn't it a contradiction in terms to use the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global media to put a case against globalisation?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vandana Shiva:         I don't think BBC is a product of the economic 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globalisation regime that the World Trade Organisation gave us or the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new recent trade liberalisation has given us. I think it was created 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in l922 and international integration, international communication is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not what economic globalisation is about. Corporate concentration, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corporate control is what recent economic globalisation is about and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in fact the BBCis a counter-example to that because the real example 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of globalised media and communication is Time Warner, now bought up 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by American on Line, Disney, and the News Corporation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Prof. Vinod Chowdhury, reader in economics at St. Stephen's 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College:         It strikes me as very extraordinary that Vandanaji 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have such a one sided approach. And I'm saying that with due 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respect to the sheer vivacity of her presentation. Vandanaji seems to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that there are two clearly antithetical paradigms. One is a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paradigm that essentiallyis based on decentralisation, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;democratisation - all the good things in life - - women are cared 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for, poor people are cared for - this, that and the other. And other 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is terribly evil. Everything's wrong with it. Now surely life cannot 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be like that Vandanaji may I plead with you to please consider third 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paradigm, where we take bits and pieces from here and thereand get an 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eclectic, practical approach, and I support Boopinder Singh Hooda - 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the President of the Haryama Congress who asked you - and you didn't 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer that - what is the alternative at a time when no country 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;canopt out of the WTO - it's not a piece of paper madam - it is a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commitment that countries have to make or they will be paraiah 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;countries and we cannot afford to be a paraiah country - please 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;react?  Vandana Shiva:         I did react to him. And I said 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewriting those rules - rewriting those rules that are one sided. In 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fact it's the WTO rules that are totally one sided because they 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really only protect the interest of one sector of the global 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community which is the global corporations, not in the local 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;industry, not even local retail business, not small farmers anywhere, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not in the north and not in the south. And those rules can be 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewritten. That is the point I'm trying to make. Do not treat WTO 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rules inthe Uruguay Round Treaty as the final word on how trade 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be carried out. Those rules are being reviewed. What we have 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called for in Seattle isa more democratic input in what sustainable 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and just rules would look likefor agriculture on intellectual 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property rights, in the area of services, in the area of investments, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the four new areas which were brought in. Before that - no-one had 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problems with the GATT. The old GATT was about real trade in real 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;products beyond national boundaries. The new GATT with the Uruguay 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;round - is about invading in every space of our everyday lives... and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you are a woman you do have a somewhat different point of view. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why we talk of gender. If you are poor, you will have a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different point of view from the rich. To have different points of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view because of differences in location in society is not a problem. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is opportunistic though to take a little element of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perspective of the rich , a little element of the perspective of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poor and put it into a little jigsaw of opportunistic statements. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Societies live by coherent principles, organisational systems, values 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and world views. And what we are calling for is to balance out that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one sided idea that we live by commerce alone.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Rovinder Raki, student:         You seem to eulogise the fairness 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and efficiency of traditional agricultures, societies and production 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patterns. But the reality is that the farmers were exploited in these 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;societies by moneylenders and feudal lords. With the market reaching 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these societies that exploitative social system certainly declines. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what I have to ask you is what restrains you from appreciating 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this sanitising effect of the market?  Vandana Shiva:         Well 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sanitising affect of the market does end up treating people like 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;germs. Wipe them out. And it is that view of dispensability, the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disappearances of the small that I was trying to draw attention to in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my lecture. There has always been exploitation, and I agree with Mr 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hooda, but no exploitation before this period of current, economic 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globalisation, ever organised itself in ways that it could totally 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dispense with the exploited. Even the slave system needed the slave. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the worst of British rule which created the Bengal famine, and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;led to the &quot;Faybehaga&quot; movement to rise against the exploitation, it 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needed to keep the peasants alive For the first time we have a system 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where no-one needs the peasants,unless we realise as societies we 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need them, that we've reached a period where people are actually 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talking in India, in other countries that you can get rid of small 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;producers. It's assumed that everything, real growth,real prosperity 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is going to come out of cyber space, but as you can see, you can have 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the best of IT technologies floating above the carcasses of people 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dying in Rajisthan and Gujerat right now -- and it will not help them 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out. We have to pay attention to the ecological base of our survival 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the needs of all. I personally am committed to feeling and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believing that the smallest of species and the smallest of people 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have as much a right to live on this planet with dignity as the most 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;powerful corporation and the most powerful individual.
