<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The news media loves to *claim* the successful tests
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;were rigged, but in fact such claims reveal a failure to understand the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;nature of tests.  One famous example is the ERIS test, in which the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;target contained a homing beacon.  That test was a test of the concept
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;of end game guidance using cruciform nozzles.  It hit the target, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the intercept attempt was a success.
</EM><BR>
<P>And when success was first triumphantly announced was there anything said
<BR>
about a beacon, or a heater that was used on another test until years later?
<BR>
Did the military say this had nothing to do with a practical weapon?
<BR>
Not only did every test assume incredible stupidity on the part of the enemy
<BR>
every test was downright dishonest toward the people actually paying for this thing.
<BR>
Their credibility is zero, if they wish to regain people's trust there is only one thing
<BR>
to do, declassify EVERYTHING.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Was the Wright brother's flight at Kitty Hawk a realistic test?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it proved gravity could be defeated. No &quot;test&quot; has told us a thing about
<BR>
how a nuclear enemy could be defeated.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;ERIS was a proof-of-concept  that later led to the THAAD system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Proof of what concept, that under the right condition a missile can shoot down
<BR>
another missile? That didn't need proving everybody already knew it was true,
<BR>
I want to know if a practical ABM system can ever be made to work.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;The customer was fully aware  of the configuration of the target, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;cheerfully paid to have it run.
</EM><BR>
<P>The customer was the taxpayer, and I know of at least one who wasn't very
<BR>
cheerful about the sham.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; A THAAD missile is far cheaper than the cost of the plutonium for a nuke alone.
</EM><BR>
<P>Baloney! There is a worldwide glut of plutonium, nobody knows what to do with it all,
<BR>
thousands of tons of the shit exist and more is made every day in every nuclear reactor
<BR>
on earth, civilian as well as military. As I said before only a few pounds can make a bomb.
<BR>
<P>As for the vehicle itself, a defensive missile need to be super accurate, it's error radius
<BR>
must be measured in inches. If an offensive missile's error radius is a hundred miles
<BR>
that's fine.
<BR>
<P>A defensive missile absolutely positively must work perfectly every single time,
<BR>
hardware like that doesn't come cheap. If 9 out of 10 offensive ICBMs fail on
<BR>
launch it doesn't matter, with so much overkill the vast majority of H bombs would
<BR>
do nothing but bounce charred bones and rubble anyway.
<BR>
<P>You can make offensive decoys that cost almost nothing, there are no defensive decoys.
<BR>
<P>One ICBM can have dozens of warheads and thousands of decoys. Defense must deal with
<BR>
all of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The blue team builds the targets, the red team builds the interceptor,
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the white team watches both to make sure nobody cheats.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you seriously trying to tell me that they're building targets for this thing
<BR>
as cleverly as they know how to do? Ridiculous. If the blue team does too good
<BR>
a job I have no doubt their chances of promotion would be zero. In the history of
<BR>
the world has this &quot;white team&quot; of yours ever objected to anything?
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; I can assure you the blue team is doing  everything it can do to fool the target
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;discrimination red team.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then they're not very smart and we're unlikely to encounter an enemy that dumb.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Agreed.  Intercepting is a tougher problem than spoofing, currently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; But remember,  all the discrimination satellites are not in service.  Yet...
</EM><BR>
<P>And they won't be in service when their needed because I'll destroy them
<BR>
before I attack. Unlike missiles, satellites are in orbit, I know exactly where
<BR>
they are at all times. Satellites work great in peacetime but you can't rely
<BR>
on them in war.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; of course the Union of Concerned Scientist's credibility is
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; not exactly stellar in this particular field.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've not heard anything bad about them but it doesn't matter, the idea of putting
<BR>
the warhead in a aluminized balloon is a good one and I don't care if the suggestion
<BR>
came from Adolph Hitler's illegitimate love child. It's cheap as dirt so there is only
<BR>
one reason the government is not going to do it on Friday's test, they're afraid to.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;you imagine  a technology (such as a multispectrum laser reflector/detector
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;of some  sort) in which a mylar balloon with something inside it would look vastly
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; different from an empty mylar balloon?
</EM><BR>
<P>I can imagine anything that doesn't violate the laws of physics, but I don't
<BR>
want something from the imagination, I want a practical system.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;A mylar balloon is highly reflective in the limited spectral band our eyes
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;recognize, however in some other spectral bands an aluminized mylar
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;balloon is as transparent as a condom.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, an X ray laser scanning system that can fit inside a very small rocket and
<BR>
can make the determination in a few nanoseconds. Spend a few hundred billion
<BR>
dollars and I'll bet you could come up with something that worked pretty well, in
<BR>
a lab. Congratulations, you have taken your first step in fighting your way inside
<BR>
a 79 cent plastic bag.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Also, a warhead can be fired upon after it hits the upper atmosphere
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;and before it develops a plasma sheath, using the Patriot Advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;Capability or PAC3.
</EM><BR>
<P>Such a rocket would be of extremely short range so you'd need thousands.
<BR>
perhaps millions to cover the entire continental USA, but it wouldn't help anyway.
<BR>
I'll first send a warhead to detonate 50 or 60 miles above your city, even in the unlikely
<BR>
event your electronics are not fried by the EMP the resulting huge cloud of plasma
<BR>
would be opaque to light, RADAR and infrared, I could send anything I wanted to
<BR>
through it and you'd never know until it was much too late.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; then we should stay indefinitely with no-defense?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not something we choose, it's just the way things are. I wish defense had
<BR>
gained the upper hand over offense too, but wishing does not make it so.
