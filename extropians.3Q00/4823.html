<EM>&gt; &gt;  about recently and remains hotly contested as being painting at all.)

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The argument about whether abstract painting is art is a hot topic?

<EM>&gt; Sorry, Technotrasncendance, you have a cool sounding name,
</EM><BR>
<P>Transcend rhetorical attempts to persuade people!:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but what century are you talking about?
</EM><BR>
<P>Now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually.... remains *is* a good word for this particular word game, but
</EM><BR>
only
<BR>
<EM>&gt; if your definition of remains is a noun. This argument is so far removed
</EM><BR>
from
<BR>
<EM>&gt; day to day discussions about art as to be a mouldering corpse in the
</EM><BR>
basement
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of critique.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only among people who think they've won over all to their side.  In fact,
<BR>
much the opposite has happened.  The common people everywhere like
<BR>
non-Modern and non-Postmodern art.  The most popular &quot;serious&quot; painters,
<BR>
e.g., are van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne, and Renoir -- not Pollock, Mondrian, and
<BR>
Rothko.  (I'm not saying that whatever is popular is art.  Not so!  Instead,
<BR>
I'm underscoring that abstract painting really does not serve the function
<BR>
of painting as an art form and hence has a limited audience, many of whom
<BR>
are just into it to be different.  From this, I would argue it is not
<BR>
painting and not even art.)  Surely, those who now control the major art
<BR>
institutions get to have it their way and push abstract painting and the
<BR>
like, but even now their reign draws to a close.
<BR>
<P>But let's say it doesn't.  Let's say I'm wrong here.  I've been wrong
<BR>
before.  Would this make it art?  Only if you believe that whoever wins in
<BR>
history is right.  If so, then the Medieval Christian view of life, the
<BR>
universe, and everything must have been right for like a thousand years.
<BR>
I.e., error can live a long time.  I would like to say the truth will win
<BR>
out in the end, but, well, history is not over yet.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
