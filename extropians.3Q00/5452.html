<EM>&gt; &gt; Only a moron would say there is no signal degradation at interstellar distances.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I am not a moron. Speaking of morons, it would be interesting if somebody could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; come up with a more moronic way to communicate than neutrinos, well lets see,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gravity waves would be pretty stupid, but perhaps not quite stupid enough. Come on,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; somebody out there must have a stupider idea.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay:  Shout REALLY LOUD...

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Most people think Star Trek has solved the problem of faster-than-light
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; travel. I am much more fascinated by Star Trek's solution to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sound-in-a-vacuum problem.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         --Karen Lingel
</EM><BR>
<P>And of course John is positive that the Star Trek universe is accurate that most
<BR>
all people would have no problem with questions of continuity of conciousness in
<BR>
teleportation as described in Star Trek tech manuals.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On a more serious note, are we really sure that neutrinos can't be used for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communication?  Suppose you had some way to aim the neutrino beam almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly, correcting for gravitational influences, so that you can pour a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beam into a 1mm-diameter cup orbiting another star.  Suppose that you also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fire off a million neutrinos in a perfect two-dimensional grid, each neutrino
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an infinitesimal bit to the side of the previous one, so that at least one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neutrino in the pattern is guaranteed to hit any atomic nucleus inside the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pattern's radius.  Fire the beam at a crystal where the atomic spacing is less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than the pattern diameter, and at least one neutrino is guaranteed to hit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The result could be an interstellar radio that shines effortlessly through any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of dust.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have no idea whether this makes any sense from a physicist's perspective,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but my guess is &quot;NO&quot;.  The basic assumption seems to be that a really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly aimed neutrino can be deliberately made to be absorbed by an atom,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I don't know whether the penetrating quality of neutrinos derives from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improbability of a perfect hit, or the improbability of absorption in any hit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (glancing or otherwise).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is a detector made of neutronium more likely to get hit?  Could you reverse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the patterned-neutrino theory and use patterned neutronium to guarantee a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hit?  Or is that just not the way quantum neutridynamics work?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Neutrino-neutronium radio... ought to be a pun here...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This makes a nice little dialogue for a post-Singularity novel:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;You communicate with Andromeda?  How?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &quot;Oh, we send out a sequence of neutrinos; a neutrino strikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      a chlorine atom and turns it into argon, that's a 'one'...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;But can't a neutrino pass through ten light-years of lead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without being absorbed?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &quot;We aim them really carefully.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Either that, or our signalling syntax is REALLY redundant, such that we could
<BR>
interpolate the whole message if only 0.000000000000001% of the neutrinos are
<BR>
recieved...
<BR>
<P>In reality, since neutrinos don't interfere with normal matter much at all, and
<BR>
we don't typically have any chlorine-37 of any appreciable amount in us, we
<BR>
could use neutron stars as a sort of teletype machine, dropping great gobs of
<BR>
hydrogen at them so they send out huge quantities of neutrinos at discrete
<BR>
intervals. We also use a wormhole as a wave guide, and the reverse setup on the
<BR>
other end to focus the signal...
