<P><EM>&gt; Fortunately this inability didn't harm Asimov's self esteem much. In his

<EM>&gt; autobiography he said that in his entire life he'd only met two people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were smarter than him, one was Marvin Minsky and the other was Carl Sagan.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be somewhat illuminating to know what their relative IQs were.
<BR>
(IQ has its limitations, but its the only relatively universal measure
<BR>
we currently have.)
<BR>
<P>I've only personally met Minsky and he is clearly a couple of std. dev.
<BR>
above the norm.  It is interesting to observe that Minsky speaks
<BR>
admirably of only a few individuals, one that comes to mind is Winograd.
<BR>
(Yet Winograd has done little of note over the last decade, IMO).
<BR>
<P>The interesting question would be, who among the current generation
<BR>
are the leaders?  Drexler/Merkle/Freitas come to mind, perhaps with Kaku
<BR>
(though he has his shortcomings).
<BR>
<P>How do we determine the cutting edge people (in hard core sciences
<BR>
[physics, chemistry, etc.]) and how do we balance them against the
<BR>
&quot;soft-core&quot; sciences [economics, religion, philosophy, etc.] (not
<BR>
that I think of them as such)?  (Yes, of course, I realize I'm
<BR>
making an arbitrary distinction between hard/soft-core; please focus
<BR>
on the designation/education issues rather than the semantic issues)
<BR>
If Robin or Max were to identify the &quot;next generation&quot; cutting-edge
<BR>
economists/philosophers, who would they be?
<BR>
<P>It is a very interesting question re: extropianism, self-evolution,
<BR>
etc. that the &quot;leaders&quot; are in their '30s-40s.  Can they/we continue
<BR>
to innovate in a way that attracts individuals, or is it time to
<BR>
pass on the directional-perogative?
<BR>
<P>Just some thoughts,
<BR>
Robert
