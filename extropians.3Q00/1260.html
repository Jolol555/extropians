<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure we know much about how nanotech changes the relative rates of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; progress.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not in detail, no. But that doesn't mean we can just dismiss the subject,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... Until we have a better picture ... it is going to be very hard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assess the plausibility of any particular technology scenario.
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems as it you are trying to dismiss my analysis of uploads by saying that
<BR>
since nanotech advances will happen first, and we don't understand what that
<BR>
implies, we can't talk about uploads.  Recurse this argument (e.g., we don't
<BR>
understand the internet, so we can't talk about nanotech) and we can't talk about
<BR>
anything.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; ... <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... you analyzed the effects of rapidly adding uploads to the labor pool
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in considerable detail. However, your analysis focused exclusively on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supply side of the equation - there is no consideration of the fact that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploads also contribute to agregate demand, which would tend to offset the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; downward pressure on wages.
</EM><BR>
<P>See also: <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/aigrow.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/aigrow.pdf</A> or .ps    When you fully include this
<BR>
effect, you still get the same result.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I also think that your 'fast, cheap copying' assumption is an artefact caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by projecting a very advanced technology into a world that is otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unchanged. If uploads actually existed today, copying one would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multi-million dollar operation involving weeks or months of work by a team of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highly-paid specialists.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand this.  We're talking about uploads as software that runs on
<BR>
artificial hardware.  Software is quickly copiable even today.  Scanning a brain
<BR>
to create an upload would take a lot of work, but copying an uploadsshould be very
<BR>
easy given another copy of the same hardware to copy into.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ... It is also a world right on the verge of full-fledged mental modification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology, which takes us beyond the realm of easy prediction.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, if you recurse this argument, you also end up not being able to talk about
<BR>
anything.
