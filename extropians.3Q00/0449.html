Begging your pardon, I have always dislike the 'balloon analogy' simply 
<BR>
because it seems to deceive more then it illuminates. Are we dots on the 
<BR>
surface of the balloon, or are we really part of the skin, in actuality?  
<BR>
Also, there is a new substance, many times the total mass/area of the balloon 
<BR>
called 'helium'-seems to be a dissociated 'surface' of sorts-we'll have to 
<BR>
wait for better telescopes to fund out. More disturbingly, in the exact 
<BR>
opposite direction there seems to be a fantastically large amount of Nitrogen 
<BR>
and Oxygen mixed together. Some of the crazier theorists suggest that there 
<BR>
may even be an ensemble of other balloons out 'there' somewhere, and the most 
<BR>
loony have promoted some concepts of 'non-baloons', how silly can ya get?

<P>&lt;&lt; The guys in Flatland live on the surface of a rubber balloon. One day they
<BR>
&nbsp;learn that the balloon is inflated by a *huge* quantity of helium gas. Does
<BR>
&nbsp;this make much practical difference to their moderately complex universe?
<BR>
&nbsp;Maybe not - helium is pretty simple stuff. &gt;&gt;
