<P>Well, that depends.  Within a given society, some will consider
<BR>
any attempt to spread technologically advanced culture {such
<BR>
as selling our computers to their citizens who would otherwise
<BR>
be obedient slaves of the local religious authorities} as bullying.
<BR>
<P>I see the problem as a terrorist from Iraq for instance, smuggles
<BR>
a nuke missile into Iran for instance, fires at the US from there
<BR>
in hopes that we rain down a retaliatory salvo upon their enemy,
<BR>
who is, after all, a slightly different *brand* of religion, and therefor
<BR>
the worst kind of heretic, worthy of brutal annihilation.  THATS a
<BR>
scary scenario.
<BR>
<P>Hey, friends, man, I need to ease off this heavy topic!  I
<BR>
find it most distressing to talk about weapons of mass
<BR>
destruction, unless it is about how to defeat them.  Eventually
<BR>
I do want to discuss what is the next step, should we manage
<BR>
to build a workable interceptor.  spike
