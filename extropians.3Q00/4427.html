<P>Paul, I'm sorry that you felt alienated by some of the responses. I hope
<BR>
you reconsider your decision, and I am saddened that the thread I
<BR>
started as an attempt to address some of the very same concerns you
<BR>
voiced seems to have had the opposite effect in your opinion.
<BR>
<P>We all get upset and have periods where we just want to walk away. So I
<BR>
don't think that anybody will hold it against you if you don't follow
<BR>
through on this one... except maybe one or two individuals who may have
<BR>
it in for you personally, and what do you care what they think of you
<BR>
anyway, eh?
<BR>
<P>We need you and more like you here to balance our liberthink. If
<BR>
everyone who isn't a libertarian abdicates from participating in the
<BR>
Extropy Institute, it will become less objective and less broad-based,
<BR>
and that isn't in anybody's advantage. To paraphrase Randy Smith's
<BR>
post, the bottom line is survival and advancement, not a particular
<BR>
economic ideology.
<BR>
<P>The real divergence appears to be not between statists and
<BR>
libertarians, but between those who think strict lassiez faire is
<BR>
already perfect, and those who see problems that will need to be
<BR>
solved, hopefully before they are upon us. Of course, anything that is
<BR>
examined closely enough turns out to be imperfect, so the barrier to
<BR>
this list seeing 'debugging markets' as a worthwhile problem to
<BR>
investigate might be abandoning prejudices (from both sides of the
<BR>
quaint little duality we grandiosely call the political spectrum) and
<BR>
tackling it rationally and conscientiously.
<BR>
<P>While I'm at it, I'd like to thank the authors of the dozens upon
<BR>
dozens of replies to this thread. While it focused on bread-and-gold
<BR>
type economics more than on the general class of arbitration/allocation
<BR>
systems I was hoping for, it still was very instructive. I expect to
<BR>
spend a long time digesting the thread and extracting the lessons
<BR>
therein. Heck, this list has essentially just written a short book on
<BR>
the issue.
