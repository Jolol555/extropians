<P><EM> &gt; Well, JR, my investigation of the matter tells me that the knowledge in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the public domain alone is sufficient that a mega-project could be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; undertaken now to develop AI to surpass human equivalency and it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; analogous to the man-on-the-moon effort from a 1960 vantage point. In
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; other words, put 10 years and x billion $ into it and we can expect to
</EM><BR>
<P>Or one year, and 10*x billion? Or 100*x billion?
<BR>
<P>Sorry, that doesn't work that way. You can hurry certain developments
<BR>
by throwing resources on it, up to a point. But some projects just
<BR>
need input from too many fields (which also have to be developed) to
<BR>
soak for a while before generating output. In fact some projects will
<BR>
become later, if given more resources.
<BR>
<P>To start with, you won't have enough crunch by 2010 to be able to run
<BR>
anything serious in a single installation. And lack of bandwidth and
<BR>
too high latency between distant installations will bottleneck the
<BR>
total size of what you can run. And you can't invest in hardware,
<BR>
because after a few months something much better comes along.
<BR>
<P>One architecture which commodity computing hasn't produced yet is a
<BR>
scalable embedded RAM based neuronal accelerator engine. But, of
<BR>
course, the fastest engine will be quite useless if you're running the 
<BR>
wrong model. And I doubt neuroscience will find it all out in just a
<BR>
decade. 
<BR>
<P>You might be able to hurry up molecular circuitry development by
<BR>
pumping a large percentile of the GNP of major industrial nations, but 
<BR>
I doubt it. Your bottleneck will be people who know what they're
<BR>
doing. You can't train them fast enough, and they'll be essentially
<BR>
glorified administrators, commanding hordes of less skilled people.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; succeed. Between 2000 and 2010 might require tens of billions, even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hundreds of billions of dollars but we can plan it out now and we can see
</EM><BR>
<P>If you want to fund a worthwhile project, which doesn't in the end
<BR>
turn round and bite clean your head off, why don't you fund uploading
<BR>
critters. A virtual nematode (or even a rodent) in a simulation
<BR>
sandbox is unlikely to come out and devastate the countryside.
