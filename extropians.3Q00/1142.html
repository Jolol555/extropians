Emne: Re: SV: Makign money as a creative (was) Napster: thoughts and
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The music itself is a /pattern/, expressed in some medium, like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a disk.  It is the /design/ of the car, not the car.  The disk is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;car.  I'm all for selling disks and cars.  What copyright does is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prevent me from selling a different disk or different car embodying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same patterns.  I can't sell an identical replica of my Subaru
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or a re-recording of an album, even if I use my own materials and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;labor to build them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously you have no problem in physical property being owned. (as in the
<BR>
right to limit others people acces/use of said items.) Anything
<BR>
technological that we own like house, car, computer etc. Is the expression
<BR>
of an idea. The point that it is expressed in some form of physical medium
<BR>
does not change that.
<BR>
<P>If I get a good idea an express it in some kind of medium, and I am really
<BR>
good at it. In fact the best. Like I make the best computers, the best car,
<BR>
the best song etc. I kan sell this expression of my idea. Then I have an
<BR>
incentive to spend my time to get better ideas. Just like the carrot in the
<BR>
stick and carrot.
<BR>
<P>But if it was legal for everyboy to use my idea like they would see fit,
<BR>
then some other guy would just copy the expression of my idea and make
<BR>
identical copies. Cars like mine, songs like mine. Then I would only make
<BR>
half as much money from my idea. Even at the same price. What if hundred
<BR>
people copied it, a million?
<BR>
<P>The other guy who has made copies has had no R&amp;D costs so he can sell it at
<BR>
any price he wants, and still make a profit. If there is ten other guys
<BR>
copying it there will shurely be a price that is so low that I would never
<BR>
make my R&amp;D costs back.
<BR>
<P>Then why on earth should I try to get new ideas, and express them in any
<BR>
kind of medium?? The smart thing would be to wait until somebody else has
<BR>
devolped it and then leech of of them.
<BR>
<P>The world has then lost the best ideamaker in this particular medium. And it
<BR>
would happen again and again until it became the truth that you should not
<BR>
develop new ideas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The naked, unsupported assertion that music sales will not support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artists absent copyright won't become true no matter how many times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you repeat it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well we have a system right now that works. Not perfect but it works. Your
<BR>
claim is that another system will work better, so I guess that you got the
<BR>
burden of evidence. I will look forward to see a record company that will
<BR>
make it legal to copy their music and make a living of it. I mean it's not
<BR>
like it cannot be done today. Why don't nobody do it then if it is a better
<BR>
idea?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I am a 100% free-market capitalist.  I hold no higher moral value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than earning profit in the free market.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well there's two oposing ideas here:
<BR>
<P>Comunity owned (Socialism) ------ Individually owned (Libertarianism)
<BR>
<P>And I can easily see why both sides can sound good. Especially the free
<BR>
market idea. But everywhere I look I see evidence that nothing is black and
<BR>
white. Probably the most effective way to organise a society is somewhere in
<BR>
between the two extremes. I don't see any reason that we cannot be
<BR>
pragmatic. Whatever works the best is what we should use and then to heck
<BR>
with philosophies.
<BR>
<P>Society is like chemistry not like boolean algebra.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Re-selling information works is neither force nor fraud;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is only &quot;theft&quot; because the law defines it as such, and it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that definition we are debating, so you can't make it a premise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. That is right. &quot;We&quot; decide ourself what theft is. An I believe that
<BR>
re-selling the expression of my ideas should be considdered theft, no matter
<BR>
the medium.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Freedom should be the default premise.
</EM><BR>
<P>To some extent yes. Not totally. You want to make the world work after a few
<BR>
simple rules to simlify everything, but that will never work. There will
<BR>
allways be layers of complexities, or metalayers build on top of even a
<BR>
simple society with simple rules.
<BR>
<P>I believe that fully libertarian societies would fail as misserably as
<BR>
comunism has in practice.
<BR>
<P>Kind regards
<BR>
