<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But our decisions to make these changes aren't &quot;really&quot; free.  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is, if freedom is the ability to change our wants and desires, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't be free by that definition, because only pre-existing wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and desires can motivate us to make these changes.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So you want to make paper work be orgasmic?  This isn't freedom, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is merely one built-in goal being given more priority.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with you, but think you missed what I was trying to
<BR>
say.  Sure there is the cognitive part of our mind that wants to do,
<BR>
say paper work, then there is the more baser part of our mind that is
<BR>
trying to get us to be sexual.  What I'm talking about is the unfair
<BR>
advantage the baser part of the mind has in that it has such a big hot
<BR>
dog to hold out in front of us and make sex so worth while - i.e. the
<BR>
phenomenal orgasmic reward we get from the sex.  What I am talking
<BR>
about is, wonder if we could take such rewards and liberally control
<BR>
them, or wire them to other stimulation and activities, such as that
<BR>
of doing paper work or whatever.  So now, the rational more cognative
<BR>
part of the mind can fairly compete and have it's desires be as
<BR>
phenomenally joyfully rewarding to us as other things.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, there's always going to competing things we want to do,
<BR>
but once we've made that decision as best and as rationally as
<BR>
possible, if it is to do the paper work, wouldn't it be nice to be
<BR>
able to rewire the reward so that we didn't have to give it up to do
<BR>
the paper work?  Then, when we really do want to have sex, put it back
<BR>
the way it was...?
