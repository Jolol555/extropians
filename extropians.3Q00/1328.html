Well,
<BR>
<P>I am a complete vegetarian with a very high intake of fruit and vegetables.
<BR>
I'm 49, and I've spent a lot of time getting to know people who have
<BR>
deliberately taken care of themselves over the years. A lot of those people
<BR>
were followers of older  &quot;diet gurus&quot; like Lelord Kordel and especially
<BR>
Gaylord Hauser.
<BR>
<P>I try to do the scientific literature (which isn't always medically
<BR>
applicable to an LE regime).
<BR>
<P>My daily caloric intake varies from 1200 - 1500 cal (i guess). It is
<BR>
extremely low in fat - I actually have to supplement fat with small amounts
<BR>
of olive oil &amp; soon, evening primrose oil.
<BR>
<P>I cycle high amounts of turmeric powder... and eat lots of raw garlic;
<BR>
onions &amp; chives. Apart from the usual B megavitamins, including folate &amp; B6;
<BR>
I take zinc; chromium picolinate; Vitamin E &amp; around six grams vit C a day.
<BR>
<P>I have recently gone on 120mg Co Q10 /day and I think I notice a difference.
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to get viable seeds of Milk Thistle so that I can prepare my own
<BR>
silymarin.
<BR>
<P>I infrequently do Momordica Charantia  (the friut) on a week on week off
<BR>
basis.
<BR>
<P>I'm back on melatonin... but it changes me from a lark to an owl.
<BR>
<P>My exercise regime is mild... and I've given up jogging and weight training
<BR>
for the last eight years. Simply because of a busy schedule - nothing else.
<BR>
I still walk a lot.
<BR>
<P>I cycle aspirin; but its correlated with garlic intake.
<BR>
<P>I got my BP down from 120/80 to 90/65.
<BR>
<P>I got my blood glucose down to 40mg... since I started ethinyl estradiol
<BR>
/norgestrel - it's up to 70mg (this is to be expected).
<BR>
<P>I've been doing the megavitamins &amp; C &amp; E since I was in my early twenties.
<BR>
<P>My main vice is that for the past 10 years or so I've gotten very little
<BR>
sleep 4 - 51/2 hrs a night (i'd prefer 8- 10) because I'm working towards a
<BR>
relatively early retirement beginning next year.
<BR>
<P>I think it has worked for me. I welcome advice &amp; criticism from any
<BR>
practicioners of LE.
<BR>
<P>CR becomes my focus from next year. 800 cals/day (i have the genetics for
<BR>
it- and I've done it before.)
<BR>
<P>Then LE &amp; cognitive software will hopefully take up maybe 70% of my time.
<BR>

<P><P><EM>&gt;I too would be interested to hear from anyone here that is using mods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in diet or taking supplements to extend their lifespan and/or improve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quality of life. Please list not only the the items in your regimen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but the effect you expect each item to have, and your current age. Thanks
