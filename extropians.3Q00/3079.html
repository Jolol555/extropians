<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ever come across the idea of finding a *common preference*?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure.  Can you tell me more?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Sure :-)
<BR>
The idea that it is both possible and preferable to find a common
<BR>
preference, using a consent-based approach comes from Sarah Lawrence who
<BR>
recently spoke at the World Libertarian Conference, ISIL 2000, in London,
<BR>
Ontario, Canada, on the subject of Taking Children Seriously: The Final
<BR>
Phase of the Enlightenment.
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;A common preference is a solution to a problem, or resolution of a
<BR>
disagreement, that all parties prefer to their prima facie positions, and to
<BR>
all other candidate solutions they can think of. It is the solution that
<BR>
pleases everyone involved in the disagreement.
<BR>
<P>Some people claim that finding common preferences is not possible in the
<BR>
real world. What makes it possible is the joint creativity of the parties
<BR>
involved applied to the specific problem. The only approach that works is to
<BR>
seek a better solution that both parties agree is better than their initial
<BR>
ideas. If either party is only willing to hold on to their original theory,
<BR>
the theory is *entrenched* and the problem-solving process cannot be
<BR>
rational.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A basic principle held by people who try to find a common preference
<BR>
rather than defaulting to a *might makes right* stance, is that autonomy is
<BR>
extremely important and worthy of respect.
<BR>
<P>Existing forms of relationships, such as employer-employee, husband-wife,
<BR>
parent-child, involve promises not to develop in certain ways. Moreover,
<BR>
they involve a promise to interact with each other according to a certain
<BR>
fixed pattern which has certain fixed roles in it, and not to deviate from
<BR>
those roles.
<BR>
<P>*Autonomy* refers to the psychological state of being free of intractable
<BR>
internal conflicts, of acting from one's own intrinsic motivations rather
<BR>
than extrinsic ones. An autonomous person is a free-thinker, one who is not
<BR>
hobbled by fixed roles and other coercion-inducing obligations and
<BR>
expectations.
<BR>
<P>In an *autonomy-respecting-relationship* people don't promise or expect to
<BR>
fulfil a predetermined role for the duration of the relationship, but
<BR>
instead expect to be able to get along with each other in such a way that
<BR>
each party is trying to make the other have the best possible life.
<BR>
<P>.........So, there you go!
