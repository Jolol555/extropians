Wow, I'm so excited about all this new surveillance and intelligent
<BR>
implant technology.  The wonderful possibilities are endless.  Just
<BR>
think, as these implants get more sophisticated, they will be able to
<BR>
control every mood and thought we have. Besides giving us the medication
<BR>
we need for any medical problems, the Omni-Net(TM) will detect when we
<BR>
get depressed and signal our implants to release anti-depressants into
<BR>
our bloodstream.  If the Omni-Net(TM) detects that we're getting angry
<BR>
(which could definitely be a menace to society), it will release
<BR>
sedatives into our bloodstream.  No more blow-ups, no more Columbines,
<BR>
no more LA riots.
<BR>
<P>Just think, no more angry people in the world!  Everyone will be just
<BR>
like Barney, happy happy, joy joy!  The world will become one big
<BR>
playground where everyone is hormonally regulated to remain in a normal
<BR>
and serene state.  We'll all be happy.  The societal benefits and
<BR>
economic incentives  will be huge.  No more crime, no more hostility,
<BR>
people buying consumer goods dictated to them by the companies
<BR>
themselves, as consumers increasingly get all the techno-goodies it
<BR>
wanted at a discount!  Meanwhile the companies that make them will see
<BR>
their revenues go through the roof!
<BR>
<P>Lets face it, freedom is bad for business.  Rome got at least one thing
<BR>
right - Slavery.  But this time we can do it right.  We can learn from
<BR>
books like 1984, and Brave New World.  We can get it right this time -
<BR>
because now we have the technology, we can re-build people into the
<BR>
Omni-Net(TM).  Now we can all become 6 million dollar consumers!
<BR>
<P>Boy, what a great time to be alive!  Yipee!
