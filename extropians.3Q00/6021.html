<P>&lt;&lt; Nobody invented &quot;capitalism&quot; so it isn't really an &quot;ism&quot; at all. It is the
<BR>
&nbsp;natural order of things. It is neither a means nor an end. It is the way 
<BR>
things
<BR>
&nbsp;work. Free marketers (capitalists) need to do more than &quot;dangerous&quot; things to
<BR>
&nbsp;anti-capitalists. They need to cure anti-capitalists of their neurosis. We 
<BR>
can
<BR>
&nbsp;*not* really judge the capitalist or socialist by behavior, because we can't
<BR>
&nbsp;kill Stalin thirty million times. (He caused the death of at least thirty
<BR>
&nbsp;millions.)

Lets also look at the peoples who conducted slavery, and over 250 of European 
<BR>
Slavery of Africans (helped essentially by the larger African tribes) likely 
<BR>
cost 50 million lives. We do know that one reason the cattle cars the nazis 
<BR>
used to deport Gypsies and Jews, were conducted as a deal with the German 
<BR>
railroad companies on square footage for shipment. Similarly we see the same 
<BR>
business agreement with how slavery in the USA worked in the 17th-19th 
<BR>
centuries. Money was exchanged and business deals done, contracts signed, and 
<BR>
accountants put to work. I don't think it helps to sugar coat the way the 
<BR>
world worked.
