<EM>&gt; &gt;Maybe I am alone in this, but I don't see anything wrong with extinction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in principle.  For every species that becomes extinct, a new one pops
</EM><BR>
into
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;existence to take its place, and probably does a better job of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd like to write a lengthy, pungent response to this, but don't really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have time just now. Sketchily:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As it stands, this is nuts. It might be true that `For every species that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becomes extinct' one already extant spreads to fill the slot, but I doubt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, and anyway I'm not that enthusiastic about slashing diversity. During
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pangea, there was a vast dieback, as local island biogeographies became
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crowded into a single world-island ecology. Vast amounts of biological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information were lost. We have recreated this circumstance, to a large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degree, with global shipping and air transport. Chris Lavers makes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument compellingly in a new book with the crowd-titillating title WHY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ELEPHANTS HAVE BIG EARS. The successful hyperanimals (rabbits, say) do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; add much in the way of useful diversity except, perhaps, at some
</EM><BR>
microlevel
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of nearly-neutral intragenomic drift. This sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extinction-by-competition is usually aversive these days, I should think.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And not what one associates with a term such as `extropian'.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would rather say it's not rational to destroy such diversity and life
<BR>
itself.  No need to appeal to &quot;Extropian.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Also, commenting on the text Damien quotes (I don't have time now to find
<BR>
the original author), new species are not &quot;popping&quot; into existence all over
<BR>
the space of taxa.  I don't see, e.g., a new species of bird which has
<BR>
popped into existence to replace the dodo or the moa or the carrier pigeon.
<BR>
Nor is one waiting in the wings -- at least, in anything shorter than
<BR>
geological terms -- to replace the California condor.  (No pun intended.:)
<BR>
<P>Add to this, that some amount of diversity is healthy for each species,
<BR>
including humans and probably including posthumans.  Without knowing what
<BR>
amount ahead of time, I'd harazrd a guess less is not better.  Nor if less
<BR>
is more optimal is it good to just randomly exterminate certain life forms.
<BR>
That would be like to picking on type of bacteria (I hesitate to use
<BR>
&quot;species&quot; in this context:) in your gut at random and killing it off and
<BR>
repeating.  Surely, you might kill a few types that are harmful or do not
<BR>
effect the overall balance, but what happens if you kill off some of the
<BR>
good ones?  (This doesn't even bring up the long term consequences.  Maybe
<BR>
by not having a mix, your good gut bacteria would deteriorate.  Maybe
<BR>
something which you thought was bad is really not so and has a positive
<BR>
benefit elsewhere.  Most bees sting, but they also pollinate flowers...)
<BR>
<P>That said, there probably is a little exagerration from the prodiversity
<BR>
camp.  Efforts also need to be directed toward understanding ecosystems
<BR>
rather than just mindlessly enshrining them.
<BR>
<P>Someone else remarked about how a lot of land in the Northeast has gone
<BR>
wild.  This is true in many areas of New England.  Yet, the ecosystems that
<BR>
existed before the land was tamed are, in most cases, not returning -- at
<BR>
least, not in toto.  The carrier pigeon is gone and there are hardly any
<BR>
wolves south of Canada or East of the Mississippi.
<BR>
<P>This is not to say I recommend government intervention at any level here.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
