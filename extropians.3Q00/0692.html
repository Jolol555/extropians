<P><EM>&gt; When the automobile was first introduced, there were all sorts of hysterical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  articles and letters to editors published about it, including warnings 
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  the danger to life and limb, and even, as I recall reading, warnings of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  health dangers of such unnatural speeds; and there were speeches by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  politicians about how automobiles must stay in their places and not go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  around frightening the horses on the road.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;  It's true that we now live in a less free world, but to the extent that a

<EM>&gt;  free market remains, I believe that truly useful products will make their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  way into the marketplace regardless of hysteria.
</EM><BR>
<P>The automobile was developed before there was a Department of Transportation. 
<BR>
&nbsp;There wasn't even an income tax by the time automobiles were a thriving 
<BR>
industry.  The genetic biomed revolution is happening in an entirely 
<BR>
different world and the threat of stifling regulation and prohibitions could 
<BR>
dry up funding for research and development on the cutting edge fairly 
<BR>
quickly.  Hey Bonnie, you're a TAX LAWYER for chrissakes: You oughta know 
<BR>
what I'm talking about!

<EM>&gt;  &gt; We are consistently losing the battle for public opinion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'll cite an interesting example.  I was in London last week and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  went out to diner with friends.  On the menu were several &quot;organic&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  selections, e.g. &quot;organic salmon&quot;.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  [snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The interesting thing was the assumption by several college educated,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  moderately techno-literate (American) people at diner that the &quot;organic&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  kind, &quot;had&quot; to be healthier for you.  So Greg is correct in that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  horse is out of the barn and is slowly eating the grass in our yards.
</EM><BR>
<P>I spend a good deal of time in the UK and for those who haven't spent time 
<BR>
immersed in European media, I'll tell you it's just plain scary how far the 
<BR>
anti-technology meme has spread.  Yes, it's inconsistent -- Europeans still 
<BR>
love high-tech BMWs and cell phones, while at the same time a majority of 
<BR>
them react with horror to each new advance in genetic science.  But the 
<BR>
European media and the left of Euro-politics is leading the luddite charge, 
<BR>
and they've built up a LOT of momentum.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Genetic engineering technologies are advancing WAY faster than its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; proponents are realizing, in an important sense -- and that sense is the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; public at large's acceptance of the technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Huh?  This seems like a contradiction.  Do you mean &quot;lack of acceptance&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes - that's what I meant.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  At any rate, the technologies are advancing and it looks like in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  western societies there will be an interesting quandry developing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  As I've pointed out before it looks like there may be a lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  acceptance for AgBio since it has little impact on our actual health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  or pocketbooks.  In contrast progress on the MedBio front is continuing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  at a blistering pace.  I simply cannot see the most green Green saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;No, you can't use that angiogenesis inhibitor anti-cancer drug on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  my mother because its produced using biotech...&quot;.  So sooner or later
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the greens are going to have to confront the good biotech/bad biotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  conundrum.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If the animal rights activists (a separate group from the greens, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  at times similarly irrational), had their act together, they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be demonstrating loudly against all of the transgenic mice activities,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  particularly any plans to knock-out all of the genes in mice or zebrafish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (some small fraction of those knockouts are presumably not going to live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pleasant lives).  They don't seem to be doing much of that yet, so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  consider most of their efforts noise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert, you're missing what I'm seeing.  The animal rights activists ARE 
<BR>
beginning to protest against transgenic mice used in medical research and, 
<BR>
much worse, the mainstream &quot;medical ethics&quot; community is happily generating 
<BR>
pronouncements about the possibility of putting limits on human augmentation, 
<BR>
while there is a deep and powerful fountainhead of religious sentiment in 
<BR>
America that can be unleashed against &quot;godless science&quot; with only a slight 
<BR>
redirection of the meme-train.  Every politician who took the opportunity of 
<BR>
the announcements of completion of the human genome map to catch a little 
<BR>
limelight was careful to refer to &quot;god&quot; as many times as possible.  
<BR>
Furthermore, the use of genetic diagnostic information is already the subject 
<BR>
of Congressional hearings and many politicians are considering how to 
<BR>
regulate THAT resource as we speak.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; The luddites are well organized, have a simple, consistent theme and are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; getting better and better at getting themselves insserted into every 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; news item announcing any progress.  I'm sorry to say it, but as someone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; works in the arena of public persuasion, I have to say we're losing -- 
</EM><BR>
and 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; badly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  You make the case that they are inserting bad memes into public minds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Can you make the case that the attention or actions they are taking is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  significantly slowing down progress?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not yet (although an argument can be made that European rejection - across 
<BR>
the board - of &quot;GM foods&quot; has marked a reduction in the potential market for 
<BR>
the over-all products of genetic engineering: I'd be willing to bet that 
<BR>
funding for research and development of transgenic food crops has already 
<BR>
been curtailed).  But if we wait until we see a significant reduction in 
<BR>
investment in MedBio research before action is taken to offset it, it will be 
<BR>
too late.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  If annually there is $70 Billion in VC, some fraction of which (1-5%) has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to flow into healthcare/biotech, and more than $15 billion each in both NIH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and Pharma research -- how can the greens &amp; warm-n-fuzzy animal people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  hope to compete with that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert, VCs won't invest in developing illegal products.  Even if regulation 
<BR>
only throttles, but doesn't completely halt the pace of progress, you'll see 
<BR>
the money move into areas that are less tightly regulated.  So what do we get 
<BR>
if this happens?  Folks with great computers and telephones 20 years from now 
<BR>
who are still aging and dying the way they do now.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I kind of liked the article re: &quot;low mow&quot; and/or glowing grass.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Its an example of what the average person can see as being useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  for themselves that no amount of green politicing will offset.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The glowing grass is particularly &quot;green&quot; as it would allow the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  grass to store solar energy and release it at night allowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people to reduce outdoor lighting leading to reductions in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  power plant CO2 emissions.  Of course the astronomers may not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be happy due to the light pollution.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know you're trying to be funny, Robert, but I'm not in a laughing mood, I 
<BR>
guess.  In fact, I'm MAD AS HELL.  And the people I'm the most mad at are the 
<BR>
ones who are managing the process of MedBio R&amp;D.  As you said about the folks 
<BR>
at the SETI conference you recently attended, &quot;they just don't get it&quot;.  They 
<BR>
think they can either 1) let the merits of their work speak for themselves or 
<BR>
2) chip slowly around the edges of the status quo and get by.  Neither is 
<BR>
working.  If this sector doesn't begin to really get its act together on the 
<BR>
cultural and political front, they've got a terrible surprise in store.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Regarding going off to Minnesota and standing in front of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  activists, I'm not sure I can see myself doing it.  What would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I do -- hold up a big sign that says &quot;Go Biotech&quot;???
</EM><BR>
<P>No - as Anders pointed out, that will relegate us to a fringe vs. fringe 
<BR>
position, while Jeremy Rifkin and Al Gore take the high ground.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  It seems what ExI should do is write a position statement on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  advantages of Biotech and GeneEng to offset the Green/AnimalRights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  position and publish it on the web site.  Then we should make sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  reporters at the major papers know how to contact us for pithy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  comments about how ill-conceived the positions of the demonstrators are.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's one small step, but not NEARLY enough.  I propose a &quot;Progress 
<BR>
Coalition&quot; that gets some real money behind a concerted advertising and 
<BR>
lobbying campaign - to do the kinds of things Tom described in his post on 
<BR>
this thread.  If we don't get Madison Avenue and Congressional lobbyists 
<BR>
working on our side muy pronto, we're going to show up for the game with the 
<BR>
score already 90 to nothing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  The reporters are just doing their job (documenting newsworthy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  controversy that sells papers) -- we should assist them in that area.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're right, but the opponents of progress are experienced &quot;activists&quot; who 
<BR>
work the media like a well-tuned instrument.  It takes coordination and 
<BR>
active promotion to get the kind of media attention we need.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  We aren't just standing by twiddling our thumbs, I finished my BBC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  interview last week, and the reporter hopes to catch Nick &amp; Anders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in a few weeks.  Unfortunately, the show doesn't air until next year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and is more about nanotech &amp; uploads than biotech.  But we are making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  progress.
</EM><BR>
<P>We are, but the question is whether it is enough progress fast enough.  
<BR>
Here's the problem, in a nutshell: The proponents of technological progress 
<BR>
are mainly scientists and technologists.  As a rule, such folks are TERRIBLE 
<BR>
at public relations and broad-based memetic promotion and, apparently at 
<BR>
assessing the trends in such spheres.  They're good at things that by and 
<BR>
large don't require those kinds of skills.  That's why they do science and 
<BR>
technology and not politics and media.  The opponents of progress, on the 
<BR>
other hand, tend to NOT be scientists and technologists, but media figures, 
<BR>
&quot;policy wonks&quot; and politicians.  In other words, the other guys have some 
<BR>
inherent advantages here.  Unless you can figure out how to create a secure, 
<BR>
well funded and well staffed &quot;free science enclave&quot; PDQ, we need to be 
<BR>
prepared to play on the other guy's home turf.
