<EM>&gt;    Think about the anguish of those deciding whether to learn if they or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    their children have genes that forecast Huntington's disease, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    increase the likelihood of breast cancer or dementia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Think about the anguish of knowing that there is a problem that you might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be able to prevent or solve.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Reflect on the uncertainties that already attend the relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    primitive genetic tests that amniocentesis offers the pregnant woman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and multiply those dilemmas a thousandfold.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Reflect on the uncertainties that attend people not knowing anything.  With
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more sophisticated genetic tests you increase your certainty as to whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is a problem or not.  So what Delbanco is really concerned about is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;having decisions to make---or maybe the fact that the knowledge and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decisions are available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I usually prefer to use rational arguments to make my point, but a response
<BR>
from personal experience is the best I can offer here;
<BR>
<P>Back in early '92, my Mother began to suffer from pain in one of her
<BR>
shoulders.  This pain, while not intense at first, did annoy her.  Muscle
<BR>
problems were suspected.  After some time, she began losing sleep over it
<BR>
as bit by bit it made things more difficult for her.  Some days were
<BR>
reasonably ok, others were hell.  I can still remember the nights she would
<BR>
be awake, often sleeping on the couch due to it (or at least attempting to
<BR>
sleep).
<BR>
<P>This continued for several months, until it became obvious that this was
<BR>
something more than some strange kind of muscle pain.  At one stage my
<BR>
parents called an ambulance.  Funny thing was, the ambulance guy believed
<BR>
she was faking it.
<BR>
<P>In early August, her case was given to a young doctor.  But she was pretty
<BR>
sharp.  She noticed my Mothers' jaundiced features when everyone had
<BR>
overlooked it.  She ordered some tests, and got back the results - Bile
<BR>
duct cancer.  Pretty advanced too.  The pain in her shoulder?  It had been
<BR>
spreading...  They talked of chemo, but for this type of tumour and the
<BR>
degree to which it had spread, that would be ineffective.  A stent wouldn't
<BR>
work either.  Operating was out of the question.  So they sent her home to
<BR>
die, which she did after about 2 and a half months, most of which she spent
<BR>
in a drug/pain induced haze and with the final few weeks in a nursing home.
<BR>
&nbsp;As you can imagine, we suffered and mourned.
<BR>
<P>This cancer may very well be genetic, my sibblings and I may even have
<BR>
inherited it.  Would she have wanted to know through genetic testing years
<BR>
before (Hypothetically, if it had been available)?  Who knows.  Would we,
<BR>
her family, have wanted to know 5 or more years in advance?  Perhaps not.
<BR>
But putting aside our own human need to avoid &quot;the pain of knowing&quot;, that 5
<BR>
years might have been all the time she needed to deal with it earlier.  To
<BR>
make the decisions that might save or at least extend her life.  Even to be
<BR>
involved in experimental trials perhaps.  The knowing might be painful, but
<BR>
knowing alone can be half the battle.  That extra time we might have gained
<BR>
would have given us all the chance to do and say the things we never got to
<BR>
say or do.
<BR>
<P>Of course, such technology is not yet available for a very large range of
<BR>
illnesses.  When it eventually comes, extensive genetic testing will arrive
<BR>
far too late to be of benefit to my Mother.  Perhaps it would have been
<BR>
futile anyways.  Perhaps it may not have been a predisposed cancer.  But we
<BR>
wouldn't dream of using these reasons to stop say, breast or cervical
<BR>
testing.  And for the thousands of women who make the decision to take
<BR>
these tests, and who will take them in the future, they do so in spite of
<BR>
the fear of that dreaded phone call.  Does our own selfish indulgence of
<BR>
our fear of knowing justify putting their lives at risk?  Putting your
<BR>
Mothers, Sisters, Wives and friends in jeopardy?  Would you put your own
<BR>
emotional comfort above the potential risks to your loved ones?
<BR>
<P>Within the limits of testing we can do today, yes, we should be trying to
<BR>
find out as far in advance as possible.  You may find nothing.  But a life
<BR>
may very well be saved or extended.
<BR>
<P>Watching the woman you respect most in the world curled up like a child and
<BR>
muttering to herself, asking you if you can stop the pain, in between
<BR>
incoherent ramblings while you look on, isn't noble.  It's not dignified.
<BR>
Gaining a few years of blissfull ignorance isn't worth it.  And some day,
<BR>
for the sake of the risk of your own discomfort, it could be avoided.  The
<BR>
writer of the article appears to have no conception of what &quot;anguish&quot;
<BR>
really is...
<BR>
<P>Cancer has no redeeming qualities.  It should be destroyed.....
<BR>
<P>Slainte,
<BR>
<P><P>James....
