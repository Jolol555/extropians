<EM>&gt; helicopter paid me a visit along with a bunch of their buddies on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ground.  This was a Ruby Ridge scenario.  They claimed that from the air a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couple of Vitex trees I had growing in my garden looked like marijuana.

<P>Has anyone else had this sort of black helicopter encounter? It happened 
<BR>
to a couple who were friends of my wife years ago. They had a huge 
<BR>
sprawling farm in the backwoods of Quebec, and they had a small patch of 
<BR>
marijuana too.  One day 5 or 6 Black helicopters landed, complete with 
<BR>
guys in flack vests and carrying machine guns. After securing the area, 
<BR>
they took a good look around, and discovered that the only marijuana was 
<BR>
in a small 4' by 3' patch out in the open.  They all stood around the 
<BR>
patch for a bit, shaking their heads, then they all got back in their 
<BR>
helicopters and left, leaving the marijuana where it was.
