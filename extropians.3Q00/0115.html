</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; females are more drawn to tall (&quot;dark and handsome&quot; too) males
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to shorter males.  To them it probably just looks better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I was in the city today and took a look at _The Mating Mind_, which has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a subject of recent discussion on this list.  I didn't like it enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to own it, so I just read parts of it while I was in the bookstore.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think G. Miller would say that women are attracted to tall men because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tallness is a sign of fitness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Several days ago someone (was it you, Spike?) said they'd really liked the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;book and wanted to discuss it.  The reviews that were posted here were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very...um, scholarly-like.  You know what I mean?  Is this a man-thing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what?  Miller says that women are more likely to understand the word 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;azure&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but men are more likely to use it, even if they think it means 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;vermillion.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't read _The Mating Mind_ (perhaps one day), but another book that I 
<BR>
found highly informative and highly entertaining was Steven Pinker's _How 
<BR>
The Mind Works_.  He also had some very interesting things to say about how 
<BR>
our evolution has effected the sexual behavior of our species.  One thing he 
<BR>
said that has stuck with me is that while men tend to view a nude female as 
<BR>
an invitation, females tend to view a nude male as a threat.  That made it 
<BR>
much clearer to me than ever before why some women can get so offended by 
<BR>
sexual jokes (particularly in the workplace), it has also led me to keep my 
<BR>
innocent flirtations to the barest minimum (except of course when it comes 
<BR>
to my wife ;)
