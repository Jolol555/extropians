<P>
Dear Extropes,
<BR>
<P><P>I like the concept of introducing oneself to a group of people with
<BR>
whom one is having an email conversation. We learn about that
<BR>
person's view of themselves, as well as gaining knowlege about the
<BR>
faceless person whose text graces our computer monitor occassionally
<BR>
(or more than occassionally).
<BR>
<P>After I read scecir's introduction (and samantha's before that), I
<BR>
looked in my (very) old extropian archives to learn if I had ever
<BR>
introduced myself.
<BR>
<P>If I had, then I couldn't find my introduction. It I had, then it
<BR>
doesn't matter because I'm 8 years different anyway from the person
<BR>
that initially encounted the extropians mailing list in 1991 (and
<BR>
some of the people here I've known for many more years longer than
<BR>
that).
<BR>
<P>Here then is a snapshot of Amara Lynn Graps, on this day, Autumnal
<BR>
Equinox, year 2000. (Autumn is my favorite season)
<BR>
<P>Amara Graps, born in Honolulu, Hawaii (1961 March 28) spent her
<BR>
childhood in mostly in Hawaii, her teen-early20s years mostly in
<BR>
Southern California, her 20-and-partly-30-something-years mostly in
<BR>
Northern California. In 1998, she packed up her household (which
<BR>
primarily consists of books and some photo and bicycling gear) and
<BR>
returned to school, moving to Heidelberg, Germany, where she will
<BR>
finish her astrophysics PhD in March 2001 (at about the same time as
<BR>
her 40th birthday). Her current research interest is cosmic dust
<BR>
dynamics in planetary magnetospheres.
<BR>
<P>[My PhD topic took a sharp turn these last weeks ... Cassini and
<BR>
Galileo dual spacecraft dust observations started 3 months before
<BR>
Cassini's December Jupiter flyby... yowza..! it's fascinating data]
<BR>
<P>During most of my adult life I've spent learning about the Universe,
<BR>
by working in the astronomy field from almost every possible angle
<BR>
from scientific programmer (mostly) to teacher, research,
<BR>
consultant. I've worked in astronomy since 1979. I'm a generalist,
<BR>
rather than a specialist, which is a hindrance in the scientific
<BR>
community. Therefore, I seek and usually find my niches for general
<BR>
science (popular science writing, teaching) in my work environment.
<BR>
In the mid-90s I decided that I would have problems in the future
<BR>
pursuing science in the way that I wanted without a PhD, so I
<BR>
decided to return to school, choosing a place and an advisor where I
<BR>
was sure I would be challenged, and where I was reasonably sure that
<BR>
I could succeed. Presently single and dating, no children yet.
<BR>
(... and so busy :-( )
<BR>
<P>The things that stimulate Amara's inner world are an intellectual
<BR>
conversation, a week bike trip through sunflower fields or a snowy
<BR>
mountainrange, calculating an answer to a physics problem, writing a
<BR>
computer simulation to run her own universe, exploring her sense of
<BR>
touch and smell, reading a tasty book, writing a story or a poem,
<BR>
learning something new on her dulcimer, learning a new topic and
<BR>
then writing about it, having music in her ears, spending hours
<BR>
printing in a darkroom, catching the ideal moment through her camera
<BR>
lens, and finding a new pattern or synthesis for understanding how
<BR>
the universe works.

<BR>
<P>I hope that you find a way to celebrate the start of Autumn.
<BR>
<P>And while you're at it, find a way to celebrate your life.
<BR>
<P>Happy Autumn,
<BR>
<P>Amara
