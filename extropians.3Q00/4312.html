<P>-------------------------
<BR>
<P>And to think I was actually beginning to worry when I didn't see predictable
<BR>
knee-jerk reactions on this issue.  Remember my worry when no one responded to my
<BR>
initial post after the first two days?  I thought to myself, &quot;where is Michael or
<BR>
Lee Danial Crocker?  Did everyone fall asleep?&quot;  But alas, some things never change,
<BR>
to wit:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, we've seen much bitching and whining from Paul, but little in the form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constructive detail.
</EM><BR>
<P>So since I came to the debate (this time) with more questions than answers I'm a
<BR>
whiner now?   It never ceases to amaze me the amount of dogmatism that runs rampant
<BR>
on this list when anyone begins to question the dogma of the tribe (cult?).  And in
<BR>
this case free-markets.  I also prefer free-market solutions over others assuming
<BR>
they can do a better job!  If you don't believe me try searching through the last 6
<BR>
years of archives.  You will find  that beyond all dogma or school of thought, my
<BR>
goal has always been about maximizing freedom and prosperity for as many people as
<BR>
possible.  Apparently unlike many on the list, I'm willing to look at, question and
<BR>
challenge any set of beliefs that might shed light on how best to accomplish that.
<BR>
Believe it or not, I'm trying to discover how free-markets can solve some of the
<BR>
toughest issues of fairness and protection of civil liberties.  And who better to
<BR>
throw these tough 'devils advocate' questions to than the extropians themselves -
<BR>
the so called spearheaders of free-market ideas?  Oh I forgot, &quot;I have questioned
<BR>
the high sanctity of the free-market church.&quot; &quot;Be gone with you heretic!  Be gone!&quot;
<BR>
You should really listen to yourselves sometimes.  Ever wonder why the majority of
<BR>
people who come across so called Extropian(TM) thinking run away?  More and more
<BR>
people I've come to know as true extropians have completely distanced themselves
<BR>
from this movement which to them reeks of excessive dogmatism, irrationalism,
<BR>
hostility, name calling and online bullying.
<BR>
<P>A personal note to Max More if your reading -  I still admire you and what you're
<BR>
trying to achieve, but I have to tell you that the kindred people I know who also
<BR>
share the desire of maximizing their personal extropy through life extension,
<BR>
intelligence increase and space migration have written the Extropy Institute off
<BR>
long ago as a joke.  Among the intelligentsia I more often than not find myself
<BR>
defending the institute more than promoting it.  Why is that?
<BR>
<P>The most striking example is the simultaneous promotion of free-market solutions
<BR>
*without* the guts to back it up with detailed descriptions of how it will
<BR>
accomplish that.  I'm talking about stepping out the clouds of abstraction and
<BR>
demonstrating how free-markets can solve such pressing issues as DeCSS, free speech
<BR>
and other civil liberties.  At most what we have seen is an honest admission that
<BR>
everything including our own sovereignty as individuals is a commodity open to the
<BR>
highest bidder.  &quot;If you can't afford civil rights you don't deserve them.&quot;  esd
<BR>
recently said.  And my only response was to ask, &quot;what is to keep such prices from
<BR>
rising beyond the reach of  everyone but the most wealthy?&quot;  Needless to say this is
<BR>
a despicable point of view and class thinking and aristocracy at its worse!  What
<BR>
more can I possibly say in response to such a statement - it has left me speechless
<BR>
and disgusted.
<BR>
<P>In regards to Extropy (TM) I'm certain that it is this unquestioned and dogmatic
<BR>
attitude of free-markets which has driven more people away than all other things
<BR>
combined.  I know that people like yourself and Greg Burch have done an admirable
<BR>
job in promoting free-marktets in a positive light - and I commend you both for it.
<BR>
I also know that the list has a life of its own outside of the institute, and you
<BR>
should not be blamed for what transpires on it.  But you must also realize that the
<BR>
majority of people are being exposed to the Institute through _this mailing list_,
<BR>
and it's been scaring them away in droves.
<BR>
<P>Until I can see a more honest and non-hostile attitude that is willing to discuss
<BR>
free-market solutions to pressing issues such as DeCSS and basic civil liberties,
<BR>
I'm boycotting the institute and this list indefinitely.  This includes actively
<BR>
encouraging as many people as possible to avoid anything related to Extropy(TM)
<BR>
Institute as well as anyone else who advocates free market solutions that come at
<BR>
the expense of individual liberty.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
<P>Paul Hughes
