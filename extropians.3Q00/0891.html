</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its quite possible the assembler won't be for sale, at least not to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general public. Large companies who can afford a 10-50 billion dollar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price  tag, may likely obtain licensing rights for its use, but that's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far cry from the average joe owning it. Basically the first company to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop the assembler, lets say Zyvex, has the potential to completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dominate the economy from that point forward.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To be honest, I'd rather not have nanotechnology, then have it under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete control of a corporation or two, but be unavailable to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; except the goods produced by it. (And likely not the best ones possible,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so to guarantee people having to make repeat purchases.)
</EM><BR>
<P>The greatest danger I see isn't that one corporation might control the
<BR>
method of production.  After all, in a free economy, if the corporation
<BR>
produced inferior products than are already available at the same or higher
<BR>
prices, purchasers could go elsewhere.
<BR>
<P>My concern would be that the holder of the technology would use it to make
<BR>
destructive devices of one sort or another that would result in the
<BR>
subjugation of the rest of the planet. As I was writing this, I thought,
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, but why would someone want to do this?&quot;  But I answered my question
<BR>
by remembering all the times this sort of thing has been done already.  For
<BR>
some people, the lust for power over other people seems to be the primary
<BR>
motivator.  The lust for power would seem to prevail in some individuals,
<BR>
even if gaining the power means the destruction of the foundations of life
<BR>
itself.
