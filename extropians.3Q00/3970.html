<P>&lt;&lt; Does the British predeliction toward dystopian writing reflect on their 
<BR>
vision,
<BR>
&nbsp;or just on the quality of life in Britain? I know, for example, that Orwell 
<BR>
had
<BR>
&nbsp;said that 1984 would not have been anywhere as gloomy and pessimistic if he 
<BR>
were
<BR>
&nbsp;not dying of TB when he wrote it...

Excellent point! That was also brought forth by physicist, Gerard O'neil in 
<BR>
his work, 2081. That Huxley in his depeiction of 26th century life reflected 
<BR>
on his own views of classist, Britian, and Well's own personal gloom, 
<BR>
reflecting his own declining health and depression; also the loss of empire. 
<BR>
I think Britian woke up from Empire when the Labor Party realized that all 
<BR>
the goodies brought forth from owning India or Africa, seemed to go into the 
<BR>
pockets of the rich and they (the rich) could not keep Britain out of two 
<BR>
wars with Germany.
<BR>
<P>My mental image of G.B. (however inaccurate) seems to be that after WW2, they 
<BR>
all 'went to pub'. My suspicion is that  Gen-X is a lot happier with their 
<BR>
lives then the boomers are or the fading WW2 generation ever was. I also 
<BR>
believe that despite today's genuine stupidities in the USA, that we also, 
<BR>
are ever so slightly smarter then the schmucks who ran the USA post WW1, 
<BR>
permitting a farm depression, the Weimar Republic, the hyperinflation, and 
<BR>
the Great Depression, and the rise of Adork.
