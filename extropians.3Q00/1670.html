<EM>&gt; Sorry, I thought he was saying that *I* was anti-GMO and then he started in on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the strong language so I assumed he was calling me yet more names.  I really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't see that line as a break in the whole outburst.
</EM><BR>
<P>Try to read more clearly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the record, I don't think for a minute that the GMO juggernaut can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stopped.  It's just that I want each new GMO properly and scientifically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; studied before it is let loose in the environment.  Is that too much to ask?
</EM><BR>
<P>No its not, however part of 'properly and scientifically studying' each
<BR>
organism is actually planting them in a real field, under controlled
<BR>
conditions, for controlled studies. Unfortunately, the luddites seem
<BR>
intent on ripping up by the roots every instance of a GMO study getting
<BR>
that far, so its rather obvious that the luddites don't really care
<BR>
about 'proper and scientific study', they are out for another purpose.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've been fortunate enough to see the beautiful interplay of nature, really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; close---much more than most people, and perhaps a bit more than the few.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; books are full of disasters where something gets loose without good thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (sometimes after good thought).  Rabbits in Australia might serve for a simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illustration.  They have been no end of trouble and they spelled the end for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some species.
</EM><BR>
<P>But the rabbits are now at an end in Australia, are they not? So now
<BR>
those species can be reintroduced. Funny how nature is. Once the problem
<BR>
is gone, it grows back.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Life forms reproduce.  If we are going to turn them loose, we need to test,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiment, study, and *really* think before we toss them out there to see what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is so Luddite about that?  Now, again for the record, I understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Luddites were people in early industrial age England who did things like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tossing monkey wrenches into expensive machinery to f*ck things up.  How can I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibly fit that category?  What I'm against is people tossing scary things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the machinery of *my* world that can f*ck me up.  So, I ain't no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Luddite---but some of you GMO-tosser people may be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except that luddites have shown ZERO credible scientific evidence that
<BR>
any GMO has any potential to do as you say, but they are still ripping
<BR>
up test crops left and right. The one instance where they had something
<BR>
plausible to say, about the corn that produces its own pesticide, it
<BR>
turned out after studies that it was an unwarranted concern, but they
<BR>
are still ripping up that corn in night time raids. They don't seem to
<BR>
beleive in due process or in conceding the possibility they may be
<BR>
wrong.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The burden for testing has to be on whoever wants to first pitch the lifeform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out there.  It won't be too long until high school kids can gene splice in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basement.  If you think the 48,000 known computer viruses weirdos dreamed up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are a pain in the rear, can you imagine the trouble when the type of kid who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can gun down a dozen of his schoolmates finally figures out how to remap a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common bacteria so they are immune to anything in the docs' arsenals?  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people might want to worry about the ethics of GMO release instead of trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure how to get around one simple dirt farmer.
</EM><BR>
<P>Using a wild hair up the ass scenario like that to try to prove your
<BR>
point is ludicrous. What 'ethics' are there to GMO release? There are
<BR>
none, its a figment of your paranoid conspiracy addled mind.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW, this really is my last comment on this thread.  You can't reason with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; howling mob.  I want to discuss Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and see if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone would help me figure if ice-nine is possible---now or in the future.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ice nine was a plot tool, pure fabrication, sorry.
