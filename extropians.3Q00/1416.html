<P>&lt;&lt; So I, at
<BR>
&nbsp;least, find it odd that *no one* who's claimed to have had a thunderbird
<BR>
&nbsp;photograph, or copy of the &quot;original&quot; article *ever* made a photocopy.
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt; For the Last Time ..........Sanderson had a copy !  Isn't that clear 
</EM><BR>
from the discussion?
<BR>
The question I am interested in as &quot;what was the original source of 
<BR>
Sandersons' copy.&quot;  If you are on a different page , I'm sorry about that.
<BR>
<P>Even non Forteans polled at random will come up with the memory of the photo 
<BR>
and supply detail without being lead. I find that convincing.

<P>Well, hell - I might just as well join in this thunder bird thing.
<BR>
<P>I remember seeing a picture - it was of three cowboys
<BR>
standing/kneeling/whatever behind where a big bird was laying on the ground
<BR>
before them.
<BR>
<P>Several months ago Mark Chorvinisky was doing research on this subject for a
<BR>
article that was going to (and did) run in Strange magazine. He asked me if
<BR>
I had any data - I went through what Saga and Argosy mags I had plus other
<BR>
stuff and came up with nothing. That doesn't mean that I don't have it -
<BR>
because I have box upon box of material from years back.
<BR>
&nbsp;I shall hunt again.
<BR>
<P>Ray

<BR>
<P>Yes of course guys ! I'm not saying these examples you are pouring out are 
<BR>
not true they are common. But I have to tell you you're taking minor glitches 
<BR>
in our brains normal functioning and using them to claim no memory is 
<BR>
trustworthy. That's plain wrong ! Some memory , in some poeple is obviously 
<BR>
wrong ! That dosen't make every memory automatically wrong , only subject to 
<BR>
peer review. My peers agree with me that the T Bird picture was out there. 
<BR>
Have we got a Frotean of the appropriate age, who does not remember it ? 
<BR>
Speak up now please.Anyone born after 1945 ish is disqualified ,of course.:)
