Excerpt from Fortean Times 133, &quot;We didn't start the FIRE&quot;, pp. 34-38
<BR>
&lt; <A HREF="http://www.forteantimes.com">http://www.forteantimes.com</A> &gt;
<BR>
<P>&quot;In both the Waco TV documentaries, extensive analysis was made of the
<BR>
taped records of recurring images of heat sources at the rear of the
<BR>
building.  According to the Pentagon's former expert on FLIR analysis,
<BR>
Dr. Edward Allard, and specialists hired by CBS's 60 Minutes, they are
<BR>
evidence of government gunfire.
<BR>
<P>&quot;These flashes occur as the fire begins;
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Those very flashes are examined here:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/flirloc6.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/flirloc6.htm</A>
<BR>
<P><P><P>leading researchers suggest that
<BR>
they are evidence of unidentified government agents, initially, shooting
<BR>
fleeing Davidians and then entering the building in a co-ordinated
<BR>
'dynamic entry.'
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Actually those flashes are active thermal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflections of the fire on a piece of material,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably mylar, attached to a fallen-out wall
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel and the material is flapping in the wind
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causing multiple rapid flashes in one location
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the flapping surface swings a reflected beam
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up and down several times over the FLIR sensor.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Fortean is mistaken to imply that Allard
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et al claim the gunmen then staged a &quot;dynamic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entry.&quot; In fact Allard claims the opposite, that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gunmen were fleeing as they fired, a claim
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for which there's no supporting video evidence.
<BR>
<P><P><P>At least five Davidians were found shot dead in this
<BR>
location.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Actually Waco: A New Revelation (WANR)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the only source of such a claim) says there
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was 15 shot bodies in that area, which is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicated to be at the only back door, in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dinning room. WANR cites the Justice Dept.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report as the source of those body locations.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I informed WANR producder Mike
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McNulty that the DoJ report lists ZERO bodies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in that area, he tried to deny the claim was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever made, even as everyone understands that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's what's being said when they see WANR.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Adding weight to the allegations is the fact that the only
<BR>
surviving Davidians were those who exited from the front of the building.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: I've got a copy of the FLIR so good you can see
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rubble the tank is pushing around, you can see
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the texture in patches of grass. Nobody's seen exiting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the rear nor being shot. The only person seen is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renos Avram, as he escaped around front off a roof.
