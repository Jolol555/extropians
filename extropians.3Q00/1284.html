<BR>
Frankenfight Round Two: Get Ready for the Next Generation of GE Foods
<BR>
and Crops
<BR>
<P>Evidence continues to mount that the First Wave of genetically
<BR>
engineered
<BR>
(GE) foods and crops (recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone,
<BR>
herbicide-resistant, virus-spliced, and Bt-spliced crops) are in serious
<BR>
trouble. Although the Gene Giants are struggling harder than ever to
<BR>
keep
<BR>
up appearances, mounting global opposition to Frankenfoods--and adverse
<BR>
reports from the lab and fields--signal the beginning of the end for the
<BR>
first generation of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Although
<BR>
critics
<BR>
and campaigners still find ourselves fully occupied in slowing down and
<BR>
reversing the First Wave of mutant crops, the international balance of
<BR>
forces are starting to tip in our favor. Among the favorable signs are
<BR>
the
<BR>
following:
<BR>
<P>* Increasing global opposition to GE foods and crops, including now
<BR>
North
<BR>
America. Almost 90% of gene-crops are currently produced in the US and
<BR>
Canada. While major foreign export markets for GE-tainted foods and
<BR>
seeds
<BR>
continue, slowly but surely, to close down (Europe, Japan, South Korea,
<BR>
Brazil) consumer opposition in Canada and the US increases month by
<BR>
month--in spite of, or perhaps even partly because of,  the multi
<BR>
million
<BR>
dollar PR campaign being waged by agbiotech interests. Latest
<BR>
industry-funded polls show 59% of Canadians flatly opposed to GE foods,
<BR>
while 51% in the US say the same thing--with the overwhelming majority
<BR>
in
<BR>
both countries expressing mounting concern over the lack of
<BR>
safety-testing
<BR>
and labeling. In Europe up to 70% adamantly oppose GMOs, while 82% of
<BR>
Japanese are opposed. In response North American farmers are already
<BR>
starting to cut back on major GE crops--corn, soybeans, and canola.
<BR>
Latest
<BR>
July USDA estimates show a 20% drop in GE corn acreage and a 6% drop in
<BR>
soybeans, while Canada analysts predict a 10% reduction in GE canola.
<BR>
<P>* Leading food companies and supermarket chains all over the world,
<BR>
fearing
<BR>
the growing consumer backlash, are removing, or else preparing to
<BR>
remove,
<BR>
GE ingredients from their brand-name products. As soon as giant
<BR>
supermarket
<BR>
chains and global meat and fish companies ban GE grains and animal
<BR>
feeds--a
<BR>
basically irreversible process already well underway--the global market
<BR>
for
<BR>
American corn and soya will collapse. Although  there was only  a 6%
<BR>
drop
<BR>
in US farmers planting Roundup Ready soybeans this year, by next year we
<BR>
can expect major reductions.
<BR>
<P>* Adverse reports from the lab and fields. As predicted for years by
<BR>
biotech critics: canola superweeds have appeared in Canada; Bt crops are
<BR>
damaging beneficial insects and soil microorganisms, promoting pest
<BR>
resistance, and disrupting ecological balances so that previous minor
<BR>
pests
<BR>
like Stink Bugs on cotton are proliferating; increased IGF-1 levels in
<BR>
rBGH-derived milk is posing higher cancer risks; herbicide-resistant
<BR>
soybeans are decreasing yields and causing farmers to use 2-5 times more
<BR>
herbicides than conventional farmers; antibiotic-resistant genes (found
<BR>
in
<BR>
all GE foods) are transferring &quot;horizontally&quot; from Frankenfoods into the
<BR>
bacteria of the digestive tract, so that animals and humans ingesting
<BR>
GMOs
<BR>
are likely incubating ever more virulent pathogens; and Cauliflower
<BR>
Mosaic
<BR>
Viral Promoters (found in almost all GE foods) are likely setting off
<BR>
hazardous biochemical reactions in our bodies. For more information on
<BR>
GE
<BR>
hazards see the Organic Consumers Association website &lt;www.purefood.org&gt;
<BR>
and its links.
<BR>
<P>A recent Wall Street report showed little enthusiasm on the part of
<BR>
investors for purchasing Monsanto's stock. Leading life science
<BR>
corporations like Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, Novartis, Dupont, and Aventis are
<BR>
either decreasing planned agbiotech investments or else spinning off
<BR>
their
<BR>
agbiotech divisions. In short prospects have dimmed for the Biotech
<BR>
Century.  But don't worry the gene engineers tell us, even if you
<BR>
haven't
<BR>
liked the Cafe Biotech menu thus far, you'll just love the second
<BR>
generation of GMOs currently being cooked up in our labs, test plots,
<BR>
fish
<BR>
tanks, and tree farms.
<BR>
<P>A look at the propaganda and activities of the Gene Giants reveal a
<BR>
simple
<BR>
yet sinister five-year plan:
<BR>
<P>* Distract consumers from worrying about the ever more obvious hazards
<BR>
of
<BR>
the first generation of GE foods and crops by dazzling them with tales
<BR>
of
<BR>
how the next generation of GMOs will (1) feed the starving masses; (2)
<BR>
nourish and vaccinate the poor; (3) make foods, even junk foods, more
<BR>
nutritious; and (4) solve the problems created by the unsustainable
<BR>
practices of the global timber, paper, and fishing industries.
<BR>
<P>*  Delay or derail strict national and international regulation of GMOs
<BR>
based upon the precautionary principle by cutting &quot;backdoor deals&quot; among
<BR>
the bureaucrats of the largest G-8 and OECD nations. Create further
<BR>
delays
<BR>
by prolonging endless debate at World Trade Organization meetings or the
<BR>
Codex Alimentarius.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;* By the time the Gene Giants delay regulations and distract the public
<BR>
for 3-5 years, GMOs and GMO contamination in the environment will be so
<BR>
pervasive that the public will become fatalistic. By then the second
<BR>
generation of GMOs will be on the market and the Luddites and
<BR>
anti-globalization campaigners will have been divided, coopted, or
<BR>
defeated.
<BR>
<P>The only way we can stop this diabolical plan from succeeding is by
<BR>
waging
<BR>
a protracted battle on two fronts. While stepping up our resistance to
<BR>
the
<BR>
First Wave of Frankenfoods and crops and literally driving them off the
<BR>
market, we must simultaneously start to educate and mobilize the global
<BR>
grassroots against the forthcoming Second Wave of GMOs. For a start
<BR>
let's
<BR>
take a critical look at GE functional foods, trees, and fish.
<BR>
<P>Gene-Altered &quot;Functional Foods&quot; --Dubious Benefits and Human Health
<BR>
Risks
<BR>
<P>One of the central myths propagated by agbiotech over the past few years
<BR>
is
<BR>
that GE crops will increase farm productivity and feed the world's 800
<BR>
million hungry people. But as respected anti-hunger organizations like
<BR>
Oxfam, Christian Aid, and Food First, and experts like Vandana Shiva
<BR>
have
<BR>
revealed, this claim is nothing more than a lie
<BR>
&lt;www.purefood.org/ge/gerice.cfm&gt; and
<BR>
&lt;www.purefood.org/Corp/tenreasons.cfm&gt;.  The world already produces
<BR>
twice
<BR>
as much food as necessary to provide all six billion of us with a
<BR>
nutritious and adequate diet now. Sensing that many people are no longer
<BR>
swallowing the &quot;GE Will Feed the World&quot; myth, the Gene Giants have had
<BR>
to
<BR>
modify their tune. Now they say that new gene-altered &quot;functional foods&quot;
<BR>
being readied for market will be fortified with vitamins, spliced with
<BR>
disease-fighting capabilities, or altered so as to be less fatty and
<BR>
healthier.
<BR>
<P>The flagship product of GE functional foods is the so-called vitamin A
<BR>
enhanced &quot;Golden Rice,'' bankrolled to the tune of $100 million by the
<BR>
Rockefeller Foundation and offered by the GE Giants as a &quot;gift&quot; to the
<BR>
developing world. Unfortunately this miracle rice is a hoax, and likely
<BR>
a
<BR>
dangerous hoax as well.
<BR>
<P>First of all poor people have vitamin A or Beta-Carotene deficiencies,
<BR>
not
<BR>
because there's something wrong with the non-genetically engineered rice
<BR>
they're eating, but because they don't have the money or resources to
<BR>
eat a
<BR>
well-rounded diet with lots of green and yellow vegetables, fruits, and
<BR>
fish. Even if Golden Rice will actually grow in the real world in
<BR>
diverse
<BR>
terrain and climates (an open question since so far it's only been grown
<BR>
in
<BR>
the lab), for poverty-stricken people unable to afford much more than
<BR>
rice
<BR>
it's not going to solve their nutritional problems. The insidious
<BR>
consequence of  Golden Rice and related myths of other GE functional
<BR>
foods
<BR>
is that it may delay or indefinitely distract the world community from
<BR>
getting to the root of the problem-- i.e. poverty and injustice. Wasting
<BR>
billions of dollars subsidizing research on GE crops is worse than
<BR>
misguided, it's literally criminal. Land reform, poverty reduction, and
<BR>
sustainable/organic agriculture are the solution to world hunger, not
<BR>
genetic engineering.
<BR>
<P>Second of all genetically engineered rice (and other functional foods)
<BR>
will
<BR>
still contain potentially hazardous GE constructs such as viral
<BR>
promoters
<BR>
(derived from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus) and, most likely,
<BR>
antibiotic-resistant marker genes as well. In addition scientists warn
<BR>
that
<BR>
over consuming Vitamin A can be dangerous for pregnant women, young
<BR>
children, people with liver disease, diabetics, and people with
<BR>
hyperthyroid conditions. How do the gene engineers propose to regulate
<BR>
the
<BR>
dose of Beta-Carotene that people will be ingesting with a diet composed
<BR>
primarily of Golden Rice? And of course similar hazards arise when you
<BR>
look
<BR>
at other vitamin-enhanced GE foods in the pipeline such as soybeans and
<BR>
other grains or vegetables. Even scarier is the notion of dosing people
<BR>
with indeterminant amounts of live vaccines or medicines gene-spliced
<BR>
into
<BR>
their food. Not to mention the ecological consequences of drug or
<BR>
vaccine-spliced plants spreading their mutant characterists into non-GE
<BR>
crop varieties or related species via genetic pollution.
<BR>
<P>Promoting Healthier Junk Foods
<BR>
<P>While 800 million people in the world suffer severe health problems from
<BR>
being malnourished, another 800 million people, mainly in the
<BR>
industrialized North, suffer from obesity--closely related to the public
<BR>
over consumption of junk foods, meat, and animal products. Here again
<BR>
the
<BR>
Gene Giants tell us they've got a solution, namely genetically
<BR>
engineered
<BR>
junk foods and factory-farmed meat (french fries, cooking oil, beef,
<BR>
pork,
<BR>
margarine) which are lower in fats or calories. But as food activists
<BR>
from
<BR>
&lt;www.corporatewatch.org&gt; in Britain point out,  the next generation of
<BR>
Frankenfoods are mainly &quot;about making basically unhealthy food (such as
<BR>
chips and crisps) a little bit healthier... But even if they were to
<BR>
work
<BR>
as is claimed in the corporate PR, these foods are in reality completely
<BR>
unnecessary when judged against the benefits of a truly healthy and
<BR>
balanced diet. Instead, by convincing consumers that unhealthy, fatty
<BR>
foods
<BR>
are nutritious, these new crops might instead lead to a deterioration in
<BR>
people's health.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Genetically Engineered Tree Farms: The &quot;Final Solution&quot; to Global
<BR>
Deforestation
<BR>
<P>Forestry and pulp paper production is now one of the largest and most
<BR>
lucrative industries in the world, with an estimated value of the
<BR>
world's
<BR>
timber harvest annually of $400 billion. Unfortunately for the planet
<BR>
and
<BR>
its living creatures, corporate greed and unsustainable forestry
<BR>
practices
<BR>
have caused massive deforestation and devastation to the planet's
<BR>
biodiversity and carrying capacity. Confronted with rapidly accelerating
<BR>
environmental damage and species extinction, and now undeniable global
<BR>
climate disruption, a growing segment of the public have become alarmed
<BR>
and
<BR>
concerned. As a consequence the large transnational timber and paper
<BR>
corporations, such as International Paper, Weyerhauser, Boise-Cascade,
<BR>
UPM-Kymmene (formerly Champion International), and Mitsubishi, along
<BR>
with
<BR>
the oil, auto, and utilities industries, find themselves under
<BR>
increasing
<BR>
public scrutiny and pressure.
<BR>
<P>Sensing a major business opportunity, Monsanto and the Gene Giants have
<BR>
sat
<BR>
down and begun negotiating with the world's largest timber and paper
<BR>
companies (as well as the other major greenhouse gas/climate disruption
<BR>
culprits, the oil, auto, and utilities companies) and have come up with
<BR>
a
<BR>
&quot;final solution&quot;--plant billions of fast growing, herbicide-resistant,
<BR>
fiber-altered GE trees on tree plantations all over the globe. This way
<BR>
transnational corporations will be able to produce more timber and paper
<BR>
for the voracious global market (without changing current forestry or
<BR>
paper
<BR>
industry practices), soak up some of the climate-disrupting CO2
<BR>
greenhouse
<BR>
gases in the atmosphere (faster-growing trees on vast tree plantations
<BR>
will
<BR>
soak up more CO2), and reduce toxic pollution in the paper industry.
<BR>
Down
<BR>
the road the biotech lobby also promise us pest-resistant fruit trees
<BR>
and
<BR>
even tastier and more nutritious fruit.
<BR>
<P>All this may sound rather nifty at first, until you start to think about
<BR>
some of the downsides of gambling with the future of our trees, of
<BR>
tampering with the genetic structure and life cycle of the world's
<BR>
forests.
<BR>
For example:
<BR>
<P>* GE tree plantations will replace biologically diverse forests with
<BR>
fast-growing, herbicide-resistant identical trees planted in even rows
<BR>
with
<BR>
no &quot;competing&quot; plants growing underneath them.  Native forests will be
<BR>
logged and replaced by corporate tree plantations even faster than they
<BR>
are
<BR>
now, since GE trees will grow much faster and will be able to be sprayed
<BR>
with world record amounts of toxic herbicides such as Monsanto's
<BR>
Roundup.
<BR>
<P>* Trees produce enormous amounts of pollen, which can travel up to
<BR>
hundreds
<BR>
of miles. Trees also distribute their genetic material through seed
<BR>
dispersal, regeneration from roots, runners and suckers--not to mention
<BR>
horizontal gene transfer to fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Normal trees
<BR>
will
<BR>
inevitably cross with GE mutants (herbicide resistant, fiber-altered, or
<BR>
Bt-spliced trees), creating &quot;supertrees&quot; which will crowd out natural
<BR>
forests. This in turn will kill off beneficial insects, decrease the
<BR>
food
<BR>
available for wildlife, and force tree pests into adjacent natural
<BR>
forest
<BR>
areas where they will wreak havoc.
<BR>
<P>* Fast-growing GE trees (which can grow more than three feet a month and
<BR>
can be harvested in four years) use up tremendous quantities of water
<BR>
and
<BR>
will kill off other trees and plants by depleting the water table. In
<BR>
addition the leaves from Bt-spliced  trees will create toxic soil
<BR>
conditions, undermining the entire soil food web and natural systems of
<BR>
composting on the forest floor.
<BR>
<P>* Scientists warn that the enormous quantities of pollen generated by
<BR>
Bt-spliced and other GE trees will likely cause major allergic reactions
<BR>
in
<BR>
humans.
<BR>
<P>* GE trees patented by Dow, Novartis, and other companies altered to
<BR>
produce less lignin (the substance in the cell walls of trees and plants
<BR>
that makes them strong and stiff) will cross-pollinate will trees and
<BR>
other
<BR>
organisms and cause major alterations in the forest ecosystem.
<BR>
<P>* Timber and paper corporations promoting low-lignin trees say that pulp
<BR>
paper processing will be able to use less chlorine and toxic chemicals
<BR>
in
<BR>
dealing with GE trees--obscuring the fact that there are already
<BR>
commercially viable non-timber low-lignin plants that we should be using
<BR>
to
<BR>
produce paper products (hemp, kenap, and residues from food crops)
<BR>
instead
<BR>
of trees. Turning to low-lignin GE trees will also cover up the fact
<BR>
that
<BR>
pulp and paper companies are deliberating poisoning the environment by
<BR>
refusing to upgrade their mills with new technology that could enable
<BR>
them
<BR>
to avoid using chlorine and other toxic chemicals and then discharging
<BR>
their dioxin-laden wastes into the air and water.
<BR>
<P>* GE companies are planning to use Terminator or Terminator-like
<BR>
technologies to produce GE trees which are sterile, thereby not only
<BR>
making
<BR>
the trees grow faster but also giving them a monopoly over their
<BR>
patented
<BR>
gene-altered  tree varieties. Given the imprecision of gene-splicing,
<BR>
the
<BR>
intricate, little understood, and long-term evolution of trees in
<BR>
relation
<BR>
to changing climatic conditions, and the inherent instability of the
<BR>
genome
<BR>
of genetically engineered trees these Terminator traits will inevitable
<BR>
contaminate &quot;normal&quot; trees all over the world. As one British newspaper,
<BR>
the Daily Telegraph put it:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Terminator trees, genetically engineered never to flower, could ensure
<BR>
a
<BR>
silent spring in the forests of the future. Such trees will grow faster
<BR>
than before, but will be devoid of the bees, butterflies, moths, birds,
<BR>
and
<BR>
squirrels which depend on pollen, seed, and nectar.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If all this sounds less than reassuring, how about herbicide-resistant
<BR>
genetically enginered grass for lawns and golf courses, a new product
<BR>
line
<BR>
being readied for mass commercialization in the United States? See
<BR>
&lt;www.purefood.org/patent/grass.cfm&gt;
<BR>
<P>Frankenfish: How to Make the Global Fish and Marine Life Crisis Even
<BR>
Worse
<BR>
<P>Industrial-style commercial fishing and environmental pollution are
<BR>
slowly
<BR>
but surely killing off all of the fish and other marine life in our
<BR>
oceans
<BR>
and surface waters. Rather than make the transnational fish corporations
<BR>
change their practices (almost a third of all fish caught by factory
<BR>
fishing boats are killed and then tossed overboard for example), and
<BR>
stop
<BR>
factory farms and industry from polluting our waterways, the Gene
<BR>
Engineers
<BR>
and factory-style fish farms have a &quot;better idea&quot;--genetically
<BR>
engineered
<BR>
Frankenfish. Building upon the bottom line unsustainable practices of
<BR>
industrial fish and shrimp farms (feeding antibiotics and rendered
<BR>
animal
<BR>
protein to fish, allowing caged fish to escape and kill off native wild
<BR>
species, polluting delicate wetlands and fish breeding areas, using up
<BR>
more
<BR>
fish protein to feed captive fish than is produced by the full-grown
<BR>
fish,
<BR>
etc.), the proponents of GE fish tell us they'll help feed the world by
<BR>
producing faster-growing, disease-resistant mutants in gigantic tanks
<BR>
and
<BR>
fish nets.
<BR>
Like GE trees, Frankenfish are being highly touted and promoted.
<BR>
<P>For consumers, restaurants, and fish farmers the idea of a GE Atlantic
<BR>
salmon which grows twice as fast or six times faster than a normal
<BR>
salmon
<BR>
might sound like a good idea.  But this GE blue revolution in
<BR>
aquaculture,
<BR>
which Canadian and US officials may possibly approve for
<BR>
commercialization
<BR>
as soon as next year, has its downside. Consider these hazards:
<BR>
<P>*  GE fish will inevitably escape from confinement, just as millions of
<BR>
fish from commercial fish farms already do every year. Once out of
<BR>
confinement fast-growing GE fish eat more and will will consume food
<BR>
needed
<BR>
by native species. GE fish will carry viruses or other diseases that can
<BR>
ravage native populations.
<BR>
<P>* As the New York Times (May 1, 2000)  reports,  recent studies ( A
<BR>
Purdue
<BR>
University Study published in the Nov. 1999 Proceedings of the National
<BR>
Academy of Science) show that native fish will more readily breed with
<BR>
giant Frankenfish than they will with their own native breed.  Over the
<BR>
short run this means that Frankenfish will breed and multiply while
<BR>
native
<BR>
species will die out.  Of course over time these mutant breeds will
<BR>
likely
<BR>
be unable to adapt to changing environmental conditions and then they
<BR>
too
<BR>
will die out.  &quot;In addition,&quot; the Times points out,  &quot;there is the
<BR>
possibility of unpredictable environmental disruptions, like those that
<BR>
occur when non-native species invade ecosystems, as the zebra mussels
<BR>
have
<BR>
the Hudson River.&quot;  GE fish companies argue that their new Frankenfish
<BR>
will
<BR>
be sterile, so you don't have to worry about them interbreeding with
<BR>
wild
<BR>
relatives. But even the proponents of GE fish admit there's no way that
<BR>
companies can guarantee 100% sterility in their Frankenfish, not to
<BR>
mention
<BR>
the frightening possibility that these sterility traits could be
<BR>
inadvertently transferred to native species.
<BR>
<P>* Scientists warn that increased levels of growth hormones in GE fish
<BR>
could
<BR>
be hazardous to humans. Certainly fish whose altered genetic structure
<BR>
makes them constantly pump out unnatural levels of growth hormones will
<BR>
be
<BR>
genetically weakened and more susceptible to disease. To protect and
<BR>
maximize their investments in these fast-growing but sickly mutants,
<BR>
fish
<BR>
farmers will need to feed these fish more antibiotics and rendered
<BR>
animal
<BR>
protein in their feed. This in turn will mean more antibiotic residues
<BR>
in
<BR>
fish that consumers eat, as well as more antibiotics in our surface
<BR>
waters
<BR>
and waste systems.  Some scientists warn that since fish, like mammals,
<BR>
produce prion proteins, feeding hormone-supercharged GE fish additional
<BR>
rendered animal protein could conceivably cause fish to produced
<BR>
malformed
<BR>
prion proteins--thereby causing a Mad Cow-like disease to emerge in
<BR>
fish.
<BR>
<P>* Green salmon. Genetically engineering fish is inherently
<BR>
unpredictable.
<BR>
GE fish have been born with grotesquely deformed heads and gill flaps,
<BR>
with
<BR>
descendants of some GE fish showing deformities, even if the parent fish
<BR>
had appeared to be normal. One batch of young GE salmon were pale green
<BR>
instead of the normal brown color of young salmon and rather than
<BR>
turning
<BR>
pink as they matured remained green.
<BR>
<P>The Second Wave of genetically modified organisms--so-called functional
<BR>
foods, GE trees, and GE fish--promise to be just as bad as the First
<BR>
Wave
<BR>
of agbiotech Frankenfoods and crops that consumers and campaigners
<BR>
worldwide are trying to drive off the market now. So as we step up the
<BR>
attack on the First Wave of GE foods and crops we must simultaneously
<BR>
begin
<BR>
to launch a preemptive strike against the Second Wave which is rapidly
<BR>
bearing down on us. Stay tuned to our website &lt;www.purefood.org&gt; and
