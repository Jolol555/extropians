<EM>&gt; &gt; Ah, but does it behave in an optical manner, mass bending the path of the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike you were doing fine until you pulled that neutrino business.  John
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clark is right of course, a post-NMD world is still vulnerable to plutonium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delivered by means other than by air, and here is a thought that should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give us pause: if we do manage to build a viable NMD, the next logical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; step is to figure out how to defeat those who would smuggle a few pounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under a pile of manure.  Such a technology is conceivable, but it does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lead directly to universal surveillance, for it would likely require all-seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanodetectors carried throughout the world most likely by insects.  I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to pay this price.  Are you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since they would be nanodetectors that should be only interested in
<BR>
homing in on plutonium or uranium, then I would have no real trouble
<BR>
with that, if its restricted to that. Have them set to set off
<BR>
air-network alarm through other nanites when they come in contact with
<BR>
weapons grade plutonium, and to home in on sources of helium (which is
<BR>
an alpha decay product, right?) as a sniffing protocol, and you've got
<BR>
your detection without universal surveillance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But before we suggest relinquishment of the technology for both for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unisurv and and NMD, we must take the long view.  As time and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology march on, the fortunes of the advanced and free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rise ever farther above the enslaved masses, and thus ever increases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their motive to see us destroyed utterly.  The religiously enslaved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for instance will make any sacrifice to prevent the wicked techno-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devils from living forever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Always keep in mind the ultimate goal is peace and the first line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of defense is diplomacy.  But anyone who has ever been involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in negotiations will confirm this age old truth:  that diplomacy is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so very much more effective if one has the appropriate weapons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to demonstrate one's sincerity.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>THe thing I find so funny is that the scientists who were adamant for
<BR>
many years that MAD was unacceptable now find it acceptable rather than
<BR>
have NMD.
<BR>
<P>Now, one of the reasons the US seems big on getting Russia in on being
<BR>
an NMD player in alliance with us is that Russia owns a finger of land
<BR>
that goes down the coast of the sea of Japan and touches on North Korea,
<BR>
right around where NK missiles would fly if headed for the US...
