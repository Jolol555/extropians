<BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; My point with my comment was not everyone on this list should become a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  libertarian.  It was just a lament on the fact that almost everyone who
</EM><BR>
has
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  responded to me on the Kosovo War has been for it.  Not one other here
</EM><BR>
has
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  spoken against it -- at least, not to my recollection.  And at least two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people have given it their thumbs up.  I find that rather strange because
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  bet on any other list, on this topic, I'd find people who vary on that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because if you like freedom and order, sometimes you have to get the bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guys. And, yes, sometimes there are really predatory criminal states.
</EM><BR>
<P>The creation of bad states -- &quot;really predatory criminal states&quot; -- does not
<BR>
happen in a vacuum.  Freedom does not, per se, encourage it.  For example,
<BR>
the US government, during the 1920s, helped to back German inflationary
<BR>
policies leading to the rise of the Nazis.  During the 1930s, the US
<BR>
government sent grain shipments to the USSR, helping to keep Stalin in
<BR>
power.  During the Cold War, the US helped to back many dictatorships, even
<BR>
by overthrowing many democratic governments and replacing them with military
<BR>
dictatorships.  (Democracies are not always nice, but in almost all of these
<BR>
instances, from Guetamala to South Vietnam, the government which took over,
<BR>
while loyal to the US, was much worse than what came before.)  Notice a
<BR>
pattern?
<BR>
<P>If not, recently, the US government has supported both Indonesia and Turkey,
<BR>
despite the fact that both nations have severely repressed ethnic minorities
<BR>
and continue to do so.  (Happily, Indonesia is starting to come apart, but
<BR>
the US government kept supporting its government with money and arms sales
<BR>
during the bloodily repressed secession of East Timor.)  The pattern
<BR>
continues.
<BR>
<P>I'm not even going to go over all the little interventions throughout the
<BR>
early twentieth century in Latin America that helped to set the chessboard
<BR>
of current instability.  (Helped but did not create, since a lot of Latin
<BR>
America's problems are due to the disintegration of the Spanish Empire and
<BR>
internal repressions.  The US government helped a lot of these repressions
<BR>
out, in the name of American businesses or fighting Communism.)
<BR>
<P>My point here is that if the US had practices a foreign policy less
<BR>
interventionist, less statist, a lot of these problems would have not
<BR>
happened.  Or if they had happened, they would have been less severe.  Also,
<BR>
US involvement did not make things better.  To boot, Americans have died in
<BR>
the process.
<BR>
<P>You speak as if the US had been some sort of libertarian society all along
<BR>
and all these bad states arose, then far sighted politicians in Washington,
<BR>
D.C. saw that they must reject libertarian noninterventionism in favor of
<BR>
getting involved.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Trying selling your wares in Saudi Arabia without a license.  Try also
</EM><BR>
doing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; things like having sex with who you want to and let the law there know
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it.&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But Saudi tends to be an intensive capitalist state-just not the
</EM><BR>
capitalism
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of the Scottish Enlightenment and as you have pointed out-little freedom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Singapore has more freedoms, yet it too is tightly controlled and
</EM><BR>
capitalist.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Pinochet's Chile' was capitalist, yet also repressive. My point is that
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; pillar of Libertarianism-economic libertarianism, if you will, is
</EM><BR>
capitalism.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And it appears as if its not axiomatically producing freedom.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the case of Saudi Arabia, oil wealth alone has given that nation a
<BR>
&quot;vacation from politics.&quot;  The government there is able to take people's
<BR>
minds off everything else by giving out cash.  (Most of this is expropriated
<BR>
since the oil industry there was nationalized.  In other words, the Saud
<BR>
government stole what someone else built.)  Falling oil prices and the
<BR>
winding down of the Cold War actually led in the 1990s to the rise of many
<BR>
internal militant groups aimed at overthrowing the Saudi government.  (The
<BR>
Riyadh terrorist attack in 1995 is one example.  See
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9511/saudi_blast/11am/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9511/saudi_blast/11am/index.html</A>)
<BR>
<P>In the case of Chile, Pinochet eventually did fall from power and the
<BR>
country is much better off now.  The reason he adapted many pro-market
<BR>
policies which have laid the foundation for current political stability is
<BR>
that he alienated both the USSR and the US, so he had to go it alone.  This
<BR>
pragmatic decision did help to create a stronger populace that was later
<BR>
able to call for Pinochet's giving up power in the 1990s.  He did this
<BR>
reluctantly, but he did it.  (Not to defend him, but his government was much
<BR>
less repressive than Argentina's Junta run one of the 1980s and Fujimura's
<BR>
Peru then and now.  Perhaps this is because there was less economic
<BR>
repression.  If you can't start a business or invest money unless you have
<BR>
friends in power, then consider yourself economically repressed.)
<BR>
<P>Also, your statements overlook two other things.  One, I do not base my
<BR>
defense of libertarianism on capitalism.  You can reread my posts.  We were
<BR>
talking about US and NATO interventions, not economics.  Aside from that my
<BR>
claim was that societies that have freedom tend to be the more prosperous
<BR>
ones -- not vice versa.
<BR>
<P>Two, the weight of examples are on the side of those who argue the economic
<BR>
freedom and political freedom intersect.  The Soviet Union and its puppets
<BR>
fell because of its people saw they could be better off without communism.
<BR>
Not one has gone back, despite years of pundits telling us everyone over
<BR>
there wants to.  The Peoples' Republic of China, similarly, is going through
<BR>
this process right now, albeit more slowly.  The other &quot;fossil regimes&quot; --
<BR>
Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba -- have yet to embrace free market policies,
<BR>
though Vietnam is trying to do this, but fears this might threaten its rule.
<BR>
(Why would the rulers there be afraid if there wasn't some link between
<BR>
political and economic freedom?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; My examples would be Minsky, Moravec, Tipler, et al.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then follow them.  No need to think or discuss.  After all, they have it
</EM><BR>
all
<BR>
<EM>&gt; worked out.  Just read and agree, right?:)  &lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey! I could do a lot worse then those three. ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny, though you are admitting to be intellectually dependent here.  I tend
<BR>
to think these guys have great ideas in limited areas.  I would not think
<BR>
that because someone is intelligent or creative in one area that that makes
<BR>
her or him intelligent or creative in all areas.  This is the mistake many
<BR>
people make vis-a-vis other people.  Einstein was a very intelligent and
<BR>
creative physicist (he had his limits that too, but you have to give him
<BR>
credit for his outstanding successes too), but a sloppy and highly
<BR>
derivative political thinker.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; First I feel that nanotech as envisioned by Drexler will happen decades
</EM><BR>
later
<BR>
<EM>&gt; then we desire and will not be gradualistic, but will become as pervasive
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the telephone became in the early 20th century-an explosion. I am more in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line with Moravec's thinking that work might disappear, not only because
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech, but large-scale robotics, as homo sapien becomes stock holders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; living off dividends, as the robots labor
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope you and he are right.:)  Until then, I'm not going to base my support
<BR>
or lack thereof for certain policies on a conceiveable, especially when
<BR>
people are being killed by such policies right now.  In other words, it's
<BR>
nice to dream about the future, but we have to deal with the present.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
