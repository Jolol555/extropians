<P>&lt;&lt; OK, it may not be worth spending TOO much time and mental effort on, but 
<BR>
I'd
<BR>
&nbsp;be very interested to know what you mean when you say &quot;minor adjustments in
<BR>
&nbsp;the Quest for Singularity.&quot;  If you found out tomorrow that psi were true,
<BR>
&nbsp;how would that change what you're doing?

In your question of Senior, Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, it brought to mind a 
<BR>
statement by actor Dan Akroyd or Harold Ramis in the movie hit, Ghostbusters 
<BR>
(1984); in which either actor stated &quot;Psychic Science! The new, defense 
<BR>
technology of the 1990's! Something like psionics of remote viewing would be 
<BR>
one of those developments the late physicist, Gerard O'Neil, would've termed 
<BR>
a &quot;wildcard&quot;. A wildcard obviously would be a new technology, almost 
<BR>
completely, unsuspected to even have a chance of existing in the &quot;foreseeable 
<BR>
future&quot;.  Most futurists would concurr (I am guessing) that in 1890 even 
<BR>
Herman Hollerwrith (sp) would have underestimated the widepread use of 
<BR>
highspeed digital computers? Jet travel would be another underestimated 
<BR>
technology/activity when Henri Marie Coanda developed the mathematics of it 
<BR>
in pre-war France in 1911.
