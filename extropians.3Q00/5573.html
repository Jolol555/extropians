<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It seems to me that preparing yourself psychologically for this action
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;requires a certain amount of distancing and depersonalizing your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attitudes towards other people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Given the very small probability of this outcome, the costs in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of your alienation from society must be considered significant.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long run your survival prospects will be hurt by having a lesser degree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of social connectivity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me see if I am understanding you correctly.
<BR>
<P>You are proposing that the act of &quot;psychologically adjusting&quot;
<BR>
oneself in thinking and preparing for a self-defense that could be
<BR>
lethal for the aggressor would have ramifications for socially
<BR>
connecting with others around you, right?
<BR>
<P>I think that you missed some other perspectives.
<BR>
<P>First Question:
<BR>
<P>Is there a psychological adjustment necessary in the preparation
<BR>
(education, training, etc) to be willing to kill to defend one's
<BR>
life?
<BR>
<P>For me: Yes.  (profoundly)
<BR>
<P>I can't be emotionally neutral, even if rationally I know that the
<BR>
(hypothetical) attacker has given up all of his/her rights, and are
<BR>
truly acting no less than an animal. I can't be neutral because my
<BR>
personal philosophy contains a deep-seated reverence for life.
<BR>
<P>Second Question:
<BR>
<P>Does the psychological adjustment of being prepared to lethally
<BR>
defend oneself cause one to distance onself from other people?
<BR>
<P>For me: No.
<BR>
<P>In fact, the &quot;psychological adjustment&quot; might have the opposite
<BR>
effect.
<BR>
<P>In the process of working through that mental exercise, one's value
<BR>
system is re-evaluated, analyzed, and for me the end result was to
<BR>
know more clearly my own boundaries and know more clearly the circle
<BR>
I draw around the people I love that I would protect with a lethal
<BR>
defense. In this way, I already feel closer to the people I care
<BR>
about because I know the lengths I would go to in order to
<BR>
protect/save them.
<BR>
<P>Another result of this &quot;psychological adjustment&quot; is an increase in
<BR>
the level of awareness of the actions of people around you. It's a
<BR>
natural result from martial arts practices. However, if one is
<BR>
already a suspicious person, that increase of awareness might not be
<BR>
helpful. But I find it quite helpful to view my interactions with
<BR>
other people in a third person perspective and as a kind of dance.
<BR>
<P>The third result I see from this &quot;psychological adjustment&quot; is a
<BR>
meta-result from the action of facing one's fears. When presented
<BR>
(consciously or unconsciously) with a fearful situation, you can
<BR>
either avoid it, which results in a blocking off of a part of
<BR>
yourself (you can be &quot;colder&quot; and more &quot;distant&quot;), or you can face
<BR>
it, understand it, and integrate it. I prefer the latter. And what
<BR>
happens when you process and integrate a terribly fearful situation?
<BR>
My observations and experience tell me that the person who does this
<BR>
finds their worldview jarred, their barriers stripped away, they
<BR>
feel vulnerable, human, and after integrating some of of their
<BR>
fears, they feel more whole and stronger. I don't see that person
<BR>
wanting to distance themselves from those around. On the contrary, I
<BR>
see those people more warm and open and wanting to share who they
<BR>
are.
<BR>
<P>Maybe some of the people that you have in mind as &quot;cold&quot; simply
<BR>
didn't learn to integrate their fears.
